Policy / Procedure Category Safety Page 1 of 3 Subject: VIII - Patient Safety Plan Western Nevada Surgical Center I. PURPOSE: The purpose of the Patient Safety Plan is to outline the process for implementing a patient safety program at Western Nevada Surgical Center (WNSC) that supports the proactive reduction of medical / health care errors as well as an effective response to actual occurrences. II. POLICY: It is the policy of Western Nevada Surgical Center to promote the reduction of risks to patients through an integrated and coordinated organization- wide approach. The Governing Body is committed to providing the resources, delegating responsibility, and acting on reports to provide a systematic program designed to effectively reduce errors and other factors that lead to unanticipated adverse patient outcomes. Administration shall provide an environment in which patients, their families, facility staff, managers and physicians are encouraged to identify, report and manage both actual and potential risks to patient safety. The program shall be non -punitive in nature, focusing on processes, procedures and systems rather than individuals. III. SCOPE: The objectives include: A. To recognize risks to patient safety and sources of medical/health care errors and to initiate actions to proactively reduce these risks; B. To encourage learning about errors and share this knowledge to improve patient safety ; C. To encourage internal reporting of errors and issues; D. To focus on the improvement of processes and systems associated with medical/health care errors; and E. To minimize individual blame or retribution for involvement in a medical / health care error. F. To review and implement the Patient Safety goals Improve the accuracy of patient identification Improve the effectiveness of communication among caregivers Improve the safety of using high- alert medications Eliminate wrong -site, wrong- patient and wrong- procedure surgery Improve the effectiveness of clinical alarm systems IV. AUTHORITY & RESPONSIBILITY: A. Governing Body - The Governing Body of WNSC has the ultimate responsibility for patient safety. To f ulfill the commitment to patient safety, the board delegates 18 Western Nevada Surgical Center Category: Safety Page 2 of 3 Subject: VIII - Patient Safety Plan the responsibility for identifying, analyzing and managing patient safety activities to administration, management, supervisors, medical staff and employees. The Govern ing Body recognizes that proactive management of patient safety is a continuous, ongoing process; therefore they will provide the necessary resources to carry out this philosophy. Through the development of strategic initiatives, the Governing Body provides direction for the organization's improvement activities. Reports from the Utilization Review/Quality Improvement Committee provide the Board with a means of evaluating the organization's effectiveness in reducing risks to patient safety. B. Administration and Managers - Administration and managers are responsible for supporting the Patient Safety Plan and the risk reduction efforts of the organization. These efforts are given a high priority, especially when processes are designed or redesigned. To support these activiti es the organization will provide: Adequate resources; Staff to participate in risk reduction activities; Adequate time for staff to participate; Adequate information systems and data management systems; and Staff education regarding risk reduction strat egies. C. Medical Staff - The Medical Staff is involved in patient safety activities by participation in the Utilization/Quality Improvement Committee. . V. MEDICAL/HEALTH CARE ERROR AND NEAR MISS REPORTING A. Definitions: Error - an unintended act, either of omission or commission, or an act that does not achieve its intended outcome. Near Miss - used to descri be any process variation which did not affect the outcome, but for which a recurrence carries a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. B. In response to a medical/he alth care error, appropriate steps will be taken in the care of the patient to minimize negative outcomes. Any appropriate steps that would decrease the possibility of the error occurring again, or that would protect others from the risk, will be implemen ted immediately. C. The physician or his/her designee will clearly explain the outcome of any treatments or procedures to the patient and/or family members as soon after the incident as is possible and appropriate whenever those outcomes differ significantly from the anticipated outcomes. D. When a medical/health care error occurs that has caused harm to a patient, staff members will immediately notify the Administrator . The Administrator is then responsible for notifying the appropriate organizational leaders . 19 Western Nevada Surgical Center Category: Safety Page 3 of 3 Subject: VIII - Patient Safety Plan E. When a medical/health care error or near m iss occurs, a staff member involved i n the occurrence will complete an Incident Report and Follow -Up. F. The Nurse of the department where the error or near miss occurred will begin t he preliminary analysis. All information obtained during the analysis will be r eported to the Administrator. G. Care will be taken at the time that an error or near miss occurs to preserve any info rmation or evidence that may be helpful in the analysis of the error. H. Depending on the nature and severity of the medical/health care error, the appropriate external authorities (such as the Food and Dr ug Administration (FDA), National Institute Occupational Safety Administration (NIOSA), United States Pharmocopea (USP), Nevada Department of Health) will be notified of the error. The Administrator will discuss the details of each case with appropriate staff to determine what authorities need to be notified. I. Data related to medical/health care errors will be aggregated , analyzed across the organizat ion to identify patterns and trends and appropriate action implemented. VI. NEW AND REVISED PROC ESSES Patient safety is given high priority at Western Nevada Surgical Center . Patient safety considerations must be an integral part of the develo pment of new policies, procedures, systems and services.

Assess the quality indica tors that affect patient safety and patient health outcomes. Coordinate the collection of data from the quality indicators where needed, perform QI studies and improve our patient care processes. Coordination with Quality Improvement To the extent possible, and in a manner consistent with the protection of confidentiality of the facility's staff and medical staff quality assurance data. IV. Definitions Sentinel event - Is defined as an unexpected occurrence involving facility -acquired infection, death or serious physical or psychological injury or the risk thereof, including, without limitation, any process variation for which a recurrence would carry a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. The term includes loss of limb or function unexpected occurrence involving facility -acquired infection, death or serious physical or psycholog ical injury or the risk thereof, including, without limitation, any process variation for which a recurrence would carry a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. The term includes loss of limb or function. (Added to NRS by 2002 Special Session, 13; A 2005, 599 ) NRS 439.835 Mandatory reporting of sent inel events. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2: (a) A person who is employed by a medical facility shall, within 24 hours after becoming aware of a sentinel event that occurred at the medical facility, notify the patient safety officer of the facility of the sentinel event; and (b) The patient safety officer shall, within 13 days after receiving notification pursuant to paragraph (a), report the date, the time and a brief description of the sentinel event to: (1) The Health Division; and (2) T he representative designated pursuant to NRS 439.855 , if that person is different from the patient safety officer. 2. If the patient safety officer of a medical facility personal ly discovers or becomes aware, in the absence of notification by another employee, of a sentinel event that occurred at the medical facility, the patient safety officer shall, within 14 days after discovering or becoming aware of the sentinel event, report the date, time and brief description of the sentinel event to: (a) The Health Division; and (b) The representative designated pursuant to NRS 439.855 , if that person is different from the patient safety officer. 3. The State Board of Health shall prescribe the manner in which reports of sentinel events must be made pursuant to this section. (Added to NRS by 2002 Special Session, 13; A 2009, 553 ) NRS 439.837 Mandatory investigation of sentinel event by medical facility. A medical facility shall, upon reporting a sentinel event pursuant to NRS 439.835 , conduct an investigation CENTER FOR SURGICAL INTERVENTION PATIE NT SAFETY PLAN 2016 Page 8 concerning the causes or contributing factors, or both, of the sentinel event and implement a plan to remedy the causes or contributing factors, or both, of the sentinel event. (Added to NRS by 2009, 3068 ) Root Cause Analysis - Is a process for identifying the basic or causal factors that underlies variation in performance, including the occurrence or possible occurrence of a sentinel event. A root cause analysis focuses primarily on systems and processes, not on individual performanc e. It progresses from special causes in clinical processes to common causes in organizational processes and systems and identifies potential improvements in processes or systems that would tend to decrease the likelihood of such events in the future or de termines, after analysis, that no such improvement opportunities exist. [Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations] Action Plan - The product of the root cause analysis is an action plan that identifies the strategies that the organiza tion intends to implement in order to reduce the risk of similar events occurring in the future. The plan should address responsibility for implementation, oversight, pilot testing as appropriate, time lines, and strategies for measuring the effectiveness of the actions. Near Miss - any process variation that did not affect an outcome but for which a recurrence carries a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. [Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations] It is an event or situ ation that could have resulted in an accident, injury or illness, but did not, either by chance or by timely intervention. Near misses are opportunities. Examples of near miss that would require the use of an incident form include but are not limited to: Equipment Reprocessing errors - not used on patients. Adverse Event/Incident/Complication - An unintended act which leads to an unexpected outcome regarding patient or employee. This would be any occurrence that is not consistent with the normal operations of the ASC of Southern Nevada or the anticipated disease/treatment process of a patient. An adverse event can also be categorized as either a sentinel event or a near miss. Examples of adverse events/ incidents that would require the use of an incident form include but are not limited to: Patient Fall Theft Employee injury V. Reporting Mechanisms To effectively reduce adverse patient outcomes, there must be an environment that supports employees by identifying and learning from errors and syst em failures. The Center for Surgical Intervention ( TCSI ) encourages all employees to report any errors or work methods that may lead to potential adverse patient outcomes. The TCSI supports a non- punitive, open communication culture. A. Non- Punitive Reporting The facility recognizes that if we are to create a safe environment for our CENTER FOR SURGICAL INTERVENTION PATIE NT SAFETY PLAN 2016 Page 9 Patients and visitors, we must create an environment that is safe for caregivers to report and learn from events and near misses. The facility requires that employees report errors. 1. The goal is to identify and track errors in order to continuously improve our systems and to provide the necessary education to prevent reoccurrence. 2. All events, especially t hose of a clinical nature need to be reported immediately. It is expected that complete disclosure shall occur. Reporting will be in confidence and shall not suffer harassment or retaliation. 3. An employee who knowingly fails to report a clinical error wil l be subject to disciplinary action. B. Adverse Event/Incident/Complication Tracking System 1. All information regarding Com plications and Adverse events are collected and documented in the Incident Tracking Report and the Adverse Reactions and Complicati ons Report. 2. The data reviewed that is not consistent with the normal operations of the facility or the anticipated disease/treatment process of the patient is communicated to the Medical Director and or Administrator. 3. The facility's processes will be reviewed to determine methods to prevent occurrence, improve quality care and ensure patient and visitor safety. C. Sentinel Events When a sentinel event occurs, appropriate individuals are notified and immediate action/investigation is undertaken. The sentinel event policy describes the reporting structure and responsibilities of the designated individuals. A root cause analysis and action plan may be implemented if necessary. D. Patient Complaint/Grievance Complaints can be reported to the Director of Nursing, Administrator or Medical Director. Employees should report all complaints immediately to their supervisor. Patients should notify the Director of Nursing. All complaints will be investigated and a response or corrective action will be made. VI. Communicating With Patients about Safety 1. Patients Rights and Responsibilities, Advance Dir ective, Complaint and Grievance Process and Physician Ownership Disclosure shall be explained to the patient prior to the procedure being performed. A written copy is provided to them for review. 2. Patients are also provided instructions prior to their procedure. 3. Patient education is provided on safe use of medication regarding their procedure. 4. The day of procedure, the nurse reviews the procedur e with the patient and what is involved in the pre and post op care. CENTER FOR SURGICAL INTERVENTION PATIE NT SAFETY PLAN 2016 Page 10 5. The nurse verifies the allergies with the patient and me dications' confirming that the patient has withheld the anticoagulants, anti -inflammatory and aspirin as ordered by the physician. 6. Verify procedure with patient. 7. Encourage patient to ask questions. 8. If there is a language barrier provide interpretation. 9. Use side rails once patient is in gurney to prevent falls. 10. Make sure the patient asks for assistance to ambulate off gurney. 11. Involve patients in Time Outs in procedure room before start of case. 12. Review post -op instructions with patient or fa mily member and verify that the patient understands his/her instructions. 13. Confirm that the patient has an adult to drive them home and does not operate vehicle post procedure if sedation w as administered. 14. Confirm that follow -up appointment is communicated with patient if needed. 15. Provide educational pamphlets on diagnosed conditions for patient education. 16. Patient Identification - NRS 439 - requires providers of health care positively to ide ntify the patient upon each interaction- using two patient identifiers Ongoing monitoring by direct observation technique, concurrent and retrospective medical record review for the full compliance of Patient Identification process Staff education and acknowledgement to establish the responsibility and accountability VII. Staff Education 1. Provide initial and annual training to all employees on safety in the work environment. 2. Staff education on safety checklist ie. preop, intr op and discharge. 3. Surgical Site Infection and HAI, Hand Hygiene, Blood Borne Pathogens and Personal Protective Equipment training is provided to staff . 4. Educating and following the Time Out Policy to assure that we have the right patient and t he right procedure. 5. Using 2 patient identifiers at each interaction with patient. Importance of verifying arm band for the correct patient and allergies . 6. Staff meetings are held to communicate quality improvement and patient safety issues. 7. Ongoing education to staff is provided regarding patient safety issues. 8. Staff education on all disinfectants used throughout the facility. VIII. Safety Improvement Activities/Methodologies Medication/Pharmacy Surveillance - All matters pertaining to the use of drugs in the Center will be monitored on a monthly basis by a contracted pharmacist. High Alert Medications - All employees or providers that handle patient medication will follow the procedure for the safe storage and handling of high ale rt medications.

Medication Safety Do Not Use Abbreviations Medication Reconciliation Black Box Warning Drugs Look alike Sound alike Drugs Infection Surveillance - Infection surveillance will be completed by the Director of Nursing on a monthly basis or as needed and the findings reviewed with the Patient Safety Committee and staff. Identifying processes that can cause potential risk to patient and visitor safety will be addressed. Recommendations will be communicated to staff members on any new measures to be implemented to ensure patient and visitor safety. Facility Safety Surveillance - Facility safety surveillance will be done on a monthly basis by the Director of Nursing or as needed to ensure there are no hazard ous conditions that would be a safety concern for patients, visitors or employees. Follow -up Phone Calls to Patients - All patients are cal led post procedure to document any complications they may be having or questions they may have. Patient Satisfaction Survey - Patient Satisfaction su rveys are completed on a random number of patients on a monthly basis. The results are communicated to the employees , Physicians , Administration and the Governing Board. Monthly Surgical Site Infection Control Reports - Physicians communicate to the Director of Nursing any patient that may have developed an infection that was not identified on the Follow - up phone call made by the nurse. High -Level Disinfectant Solution Checks - Before instruments are placed in the automa ted sterilizer , the minimum effective concentration is checked to ensure that the active ingredient in the solution still passes the manufacturer's guidelines for reuse before the instrument is placed in the machine. All checks are documented in log books . Cleaning and Disinfection of Patient Care Equipment - All reusable equipment is classified and processed according to the CDC's g uidelines. Employees clean all reusable equipment to ensure the health and safety of our patients. Safe Injection Pract ices - All patient care providers follow safe injection practices to prevent patient to patient transmission of bloodborne pathogens. During employee orientation clinical staff completes the Safe Injection Online Training Course. The training consists of t en sections related to infection control and specifically injection safety including ethical considerations and policies and procedures related to injection safety. It also utilizes video clips from the CDC training video for safe injection practices to illustrate concepts discussed in the text. CENTER FOR SURGICAL INTERVENTION PATIE NT SAFETY PLAN 2016 Page 12 Transfers - Any patient transferred to the hospital post procedure will have a peer review process performed . Safety Checklists - This new law requires the patient safety committees to adopt patient safety check lists and policies aimed at improving the health outcomes of patients. The patient safety committee is required to review the checklists and policies on an annual basis, making revisions as necessary. The law also requires annual reporting to the Nevada Legislative Committee on Health Care by the patient safety committees. The patient safety checklists and policies are to be included in the medical facility's patient safety plan. Failure to adopt a patient safety plan or establishment of a patient safet y committee may result in administrative sanctions. The law requires checklists for the following: Checklists related to specific types of treatment. Checklists to ensure that employees and contractors of the medical facility who are not healthcare provide rs follow protocols to ensure the patient's room and environment are sanitary. A discharge checklist that includes verifying the patient received proper instructions for prescription medications, instructions concerning aftercare, any other instructions concerning the patient upon discharge. IX. Annual Review of Patient Safety Plan The Patient Safety Committee is responsible for the annual review of the Patient Safety Plan. Included in this review the committee will set goals for the new year and focus on quality indicators that affect patient safety and patient health outcomes. Quality Indicators will be selected throughout the year and QI studies will be implemented to evaluate our current processes. This effort is undertaken so that processes, functions and services can be designed or redesigned to improve patient services or prevent any health risks to patients. Disclosure to Patient Senate Bill No. 339 (Patients to be Informed about Hospital Acquired Infections , 2011) Requires providers to inform patients about infections acquired during a hospital stay.

TENAYA SURGICAL CENTER, LLC PATIENT SAFETY PLAN Plan: To understand and prepare the patient for outpatient surgery and/or procedure in order to improve outcomes. Patients are adequately prepared pre- operatively Patients are well educated for post -operati ve self -management, (including their understanding of medications) Providers are fully informed of their patient's physical status as it pertains to their surgery/procedure The surgery/procedure is appropriately performed (correct -site) and clinically accu rate Review: Safe Environment of Care Tenaya Surgical Center will follow the guidelines set forth in the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN). The facility itself will maintain an atmosphere of safety with no hazards in the hallways, no wet floor surfaces or other examples that may prove hazardous to the patient and/or staff. Risk factors include, but are not limited to: 1. Patient age greater than 85 years 2. Peripheral vascular disease 3. Operating room (OR) time greater than one hour 4. Malignanc y 5. Positive HIV status 6. Heart disease 7. General anesthesia 8. Obstructive sleep apnea 9. Hyperactive reactive airway disease 10. Obesity (equal to or greater than 20% more than the ideal weight) 11. End-stage renal disease Risk Assessment: The pre- operative assessment proc ess starts wh en the surgeon or the procedur ist schedules the case. In general, the goal of the pre- op assessment is to identify and manage any risks associated with surgery and anesthesia as early in the process as possible. However, the assessment process continues up to the point of surgery. ASA Physical Status Classification System Guidelines used by anesthesia providers to evaluate a patient's risk for anesthesia and surgery, excerpted as follows: ASA 1: A normal healthy patient ASA 2: A patient with mild systemic disease ASA 3: A patient with severe systemic disease ASA 4: A patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life ASA 5: A moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation ASA 6: A patient that has been declared brain- dead, whose organs will be removed for donor purposes Patients classified as ASA 5 or 6 will not have procedures done at Tenaya Surgical Center. It is up to the discretion of the operating surgeon or procedurist and the anesthesiolog ist whether or not to perform a procedure on a patient with an ASA classification of 4. Pre-operative Screening: The initial screening process is the first step in identifying any concerns or disease processes that could potentially cause intra- or post -operative problems. The Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN) has issued a guidance statement for a nursing pre- operative evaluation in the ambulatory surgery setting. The initial step is careful pre- operative screening, which is initiated by the pre- operative telephone interview. It is the policy that all patients, except for cosmetic surgery patients, are called the day prior to their procedure by a registered nurse (RN). The screening includes the following: A baseline physical assessment Allergies a nd sensitivities Signs of abuse or neglect (if applicable) Cultural, emotional, and socioeconomic assessment Pain assessment Medication history, including over -the-counter medications, herbal medications and supplements, and illicit drugs. This also includes the frequency, dosage and time last dose taken Anesthetic history Results of radiological examinations and other pre- operative testing Discharge planning Referrals Identification of physical alterations that require additional equipment or supplies Pre-operative teaching, including which medications are to be taken or withheld before surgery and NPO requirements Development of a care plan Documentation and communication of all information Pre-operative Nursing Assessment: After the pre- operative screeni ng is completed, the pre- operative nursing assessment is an opportunity to verify information and obtain missed or forgotten information that may affect patient outcomes. The AORN guidance statement recommends that an RN conduct a pre- operative nursing ass essment on the day of surgery. TSC follows these recommendations. Information obtained during the pre- admission screening is verified. During the assessment, the following data is obtained: Verification of the patient's identity using two identifiers Revie w of the pre- admission screening/assessment Baseline physical assessment Assessment of NPO status Hypo/hyperthermia assessment and management Pain scale assessment Identification of the presence of an advanced directive Identification of the planned procedure by the patient, significant other, or guardian and verified with the consent and surgical schedule Verification of the site, side, or level, as applicable Informed consent signed and witnessed. Patient verbalizes understanding of the procedure listed. If no underst anding, the surgeon or procedur ist notified so he/she can answer any questions the patient may have. Assessment for prosthetic devices and implantable electronic devices Evaluation of the availability of safe transportation home and aftercare Obtaining contact information of the patient's significant other Assessment of the patient's understanding of pre- operative teaching and discharge planning Assessment of DVT risk and prophylaxis Fall assessment and prevention Assessment of communicable di sease risk and procedure to follow if positive Pre-operative Anesthesia Assessment : The pre- operative anesthesia assessment is the part of the overall assessment process that identifies issues related to peri -operative anesthesia management of the patient . The anesthesiologist shall see the patient prior to the procedure to inform the patient of the plan of anesthesia and to answer any questions the patient may have in regards to anesthesia. Post-anesthesia Care: Patients should have a complete systems assessment during the first few minutes of PACU care. This assessment should include, but is not limited to: Vital signs Respiratory adequacy Post-operative cardiac status Peripheral circulation Post-operative neurological status Level of consciousness, including alertness, lucidity and orientation IV patency Allergies and sensitivities Pain management Motor abilities Return of sensory and motor control in areas affected by local or regional anesthetics Skin integrity Temperature regulation Positioning Surgical wound site Nausea and vomiting Fluid and electrolyte balance The post -anesthesia nurse should provide ongoing assessments and re- evaluations concurrently with nursing interventions. Post-operative Patient Outcomes Nursing interventions are initiated to achieve a desired conclusion and/or to reduce the probability of patient outcomes that may be associated with a patient's post -operative experience. Discharge Criteria The patient's post -procedure status should be assessed before he or she is disch arged from the PACU. The Aldrete score at discharge must be at least an eight. If at all possible, the patient will be discharged in the company of a responsible adult. Occasionally, a patient may not have someone to pick them up and will request to go hom e via public transportation. If undergoing Monitored Anesthesia Care, (MAC), then it is up to the procdeduralist and anesthesiologist to allow this to happen. I allowed, the patient will spend a longer period of time in the PACU, anywhere from one to four hours, depending on the circumstances and the alertness of the patient. In this instance, the Aldrete score should be nine or over. Any patient undergoing general anesthesia is told to have a responsible adult with them for the first twenty -four hours afte r anesthesia. If this is not possible, surgery may be cancelled and rescheduled for a more opportune time. If the patient wishes to leave against medical advice, then the policy for this shall be followed. Discharge criteria includes an evaluation of the patient for nausea, pain, surgical site condition and bleeding. Patient Transfer Whenever a patient is transferred from one level of care to another level of care, the peri -operative RN is to communicate all pertinent information to the next caregiver. This is to include, but is not limited to: Vital signs and airway patency Level of consciousness Allergies Condition of operative site/dressing Location and patency of tubes and/or drains if applicable Medications given and response Intake and output Tests o rdered with results, if available Pain level Nausea and vomiting psychosocial status, and Discharge orders The policies and procedures on emergency transfer will be followed and the patient to be transferred to a hospital who has a transfer agreement with TSC, i.e. Mountain View Hospital, Summerlin Hospital or Spring Valley Hospital. For pediatric patients, we have a special transfer agreement set up with University Medical Center, thus eliminating the tertiary facility. Discharge Instructions and Discharge The written post -operative care instructions shall be provided to each patient and shall be reviewed with them and their caregiver prior to discharge. Either the patient or the caregiver shall verbalize understanding of these instructions prior to release. The discharge information includes what to expect after the surgery or procedure, what not to expect after surgery or the procedure and information on how to contact their doctor, both during and after office hours. If the patient has been provided wi th a prescription for medication, the medication should be reviewed with the patient, including how to use the medication, the side effects, signs and symptoms to report and when to contact the health care provider for additional assistance. The discharge instructions will be tailored to the patient and the type of procedure. When discharging the patient, the nurse shall take the patient to his/her car by wheelchair and assure he/she is properly positioned in the vehicle. If the patient has had MAC anesthes ia, then he/she may walk out with the assistance of medical care personnel to ensure he/she ambulates safely to the vehicle.

(800) 538- 6264 Description of mechanisms to ensure that all components of the healthcare organization are integrated into and participate in the organizationwide program. Upon identification of a process or system failure and/or medical/health care error, the patient care provider will immediately: Perform necessary healthcare interventions to protect and support the patient's clinical condition. As appropriate to the occurrence, perform necessary healthcare interventions to contain the risk to others - example: immediate removal of contaminated IV fluids from floor stock should it be discovered a contaminated lot of fluid solutions was delivered and stocked. Contact the patient's attending physician and other physicians, as appropriate, to report the error, carrying out any physician orders as necessary. Preserve any information related to the error (including physi cal information). Examples of preservation of physical information are: Removal and preservation of IV tubing, fluids bags and/or pumps for a patient with a severe drug reaction from IV medication; preservation of medication label for medications adminis tered to the incorrect patient. Preservation of information includes documenting the facts regarding the error on an occurrence report, and in the medical record as appropriate to organizational policy and procedure. Report the process/system failure or medical/health care error to the staff member's immediate supervisor. Submit the occurrence report to the Quality Assurance Committee per organizational policy. Any individual in any clinical area identifying a process/system failure and/or potential pat ient safety issue will immediately notify his or her supervisor and document the findings on an occurrence report. The occurrence report will be submitted to the Quality Assurance Committee per organizational policy. Staff response to process/system fail ures and/or medical/health care errors is dependent upon the type of error identified: SUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY PLAN REFERENCE #6016 PAGE: 7 6/01/08 APPROVED BY: Board of Managers REVISED: Ambulatory \u00a9 Medical Consultants Network Inc. (800) 538- 6264 No Harm Failures or Errors - (including \"no harm\" medication errors) - staff will document appropriately in the medical record according to organizational policy, docum ent the circumstances regarding the no harm error on an occurrence report form, submit the form to the Quality Assurance Committee and notify their immediate supervisor. Mild-Moderate Adverse Outcome Failures or Errors (including medication errors) - staff will perform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect the patient and notify the physician staff responsible for the patient, carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will then preserve any physical evidence as appropriate, notify his/her immediate supervisor, document facts appropriately in the medical record and on an occurrence report - submitting the report to the Quality Assurance Committee per organizational policy. Medication Errors - the staff member identifying a medication error (no harm and mild- moderate harm) wil l notify the attending physician of the event. Adverse Drug Reaction - staff will perform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect the patient and notify the physician staff responsible for the patient, carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will then preserve any physical evidence as appropriate, notify his/her immediate supervisor, document facts appropriately in the medical record and on an occurrence report, submitting t he report to the Quality Assurance Committee per organizational policy. Hazardous Condition/Patient Safety Issue - as appropriate, and if possible, staff will contain the hazardous condition or patient safety issue. Staff identifying a hazardous condi tion or potential patient safety issue will immediately notify his or her supervisor and document the findings on an occurrence report. The occurrence report will be submitted to the Quality Assurance Committee per organizational policy. Sentinel Event - staff will perform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect the patient and notify the physician staff responsible for the patient, carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will then follow the organizational Sentinel Event P olicy and Procedure.

(800) 538- 6264 Near Miss - staff will report the near miss event to his/her immediate supervisor, describe the facts of the near miss on an occurrence report and submit the report to the Quality Assurance Committee . Established organizational polic y (such as the Sentinel Event P olicy) will determine the organizational response to process/system failures and/or medical/health care errors and occurrences. All sentinel events and near miss occurrences will have a root cause analysis conducted. The determination of the Quality Assurance and Safety Committee's members, based on internal and external data analysis and prioritizing of patient safety criticality, will determine: Further remedial action activities necessary for identified occurrences Proa ctive occurrence reduction activities Necessity and benefit of root cause analysis performance for identified occurrences or proactive reduction activities SUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY PLAN REFERENCE #6016 PAGE: 9 OF: 10 6/01/08 APPROVED BY: Board of Managers REVISED: Ambulatory \u00a9 Medical Consultants Network Inc. (800) 538- 6264 An effective Patient Safety Program cannot exist without optimal reporting of process/system fail ures and medical/health care errors and occurrences. Therefore, it is the intent of this institution to adopt a non- punitive approach in its management of failures, errors and occurrences. All personnel are required to report suspected and identified medical/health care errors, and should do so without the fear of reprisal in relationship to their employment. This organization supports the concept that errors occur due to a breakdown in systems and processes, and will focus on improving systems and processes, rather than disciplining those responsible for errors and occurrences. A focus will be placed on remedial actions to assist rather than punish staff member s, with the Quality Assurance Committee and the indi vidual staff member's supervisor determini ng the appropriate course of action to prevent error recurrence. Sentinel Events - staff members involved in a sentinel event occurrence will receive support from the Quality Assurance Committee regarding the staff member's professional and emotional reconciliation of the sentinel event. The Quality Assurance Committee encourages the staff member's involvement in the root cause analysis and action plan processes, to allow the staff member an active role in process resolution. Additionally, any staff memb er involved in a sentinel event or other medical/health care error may request and receive supporti ve personal counseling from his or her department supervisor. As part of this organization's culture of safety, any staff member who has concerns about the safety or quality of care provided by the organization may report these concerns to The Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) . The organization supports the staff member's right to report these concerns and will take no disciplinary or retaliatory action against the staff member for reporting the safety or quality of care concern to AAAHC. On at least an annual basis, staff will be queried regarding their willingness to report medical/health care errors. SUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY PLAN REFERENCE #6016 PAGE: 10 OF: 10 6/01/08 APPROVED BY: Board of Managers REVISED: Ambulatory \u00a9 Medical Consultants Network Inc. (800) 538- 6264 The Patient Safety Program includes implementation of the recommendations set forth by The Joint Commission, or identified alternative recommendations defined by this institution, to achieve compliance with the Joint Commission established National Patient Safety Goals. The select ed recommendations will be monitored on a routine basis to evaluate the organization's effectiveness in the implementation of the recommendations in achieving compliance with the identified National Patient Safety Goals. Staff will receive education and t raining during their initial orientation process and on an ongoing basis regarding job- related aspects of patient safety, including the need and method to report medical/health care errors. Education includes the staff member's right to report any safety or quality of care concerns to The Joint Commission. And, because the optimal provision of healthcare is provided in an interdisciplinary manner, staff will be educated and trained on the provision of an interdisciplinary approach to patient care. Medical/health care errors and occurrences, including sentinel events, will be reported internally and externally, per facility policy and through the channels established by this plan. External reporting will be performed in accordance with all state, federal and regulatory body rules, laws and requirements. Patient safety reports from the Environment of Care Committee will be submitted to the organizational Quality Assurance Committee, which exists as the oversight committee for the Environment of Care Commit tee. A monthly data report and recordings of meeting minutes will be forwarded to the Quality Assurance Committee, with all information submitted held under the auspices of the Quality Assurance Committee. A quarterly patient safety report will be forwar ded to the Governing Body on the occurrence of medical/health care errors and actions taken to improve patient safety, both in response to actual occurrences and proactively.

The activities will be carried out in a collaborative and interdisciplinary manner. When identified, individual competenc y issues and process changes will be coordinated with management and human resources . The overall strategies of the program include Improving patient sa fety and reducing risk to patients , Reducing medical/health system errors and hazardous conditions by creating an environment in which patients, their families, surgery center staff, and medical staff are able to identify and manage actual or potential ris ks to patient safety , Assuring that quality improvement initiatives continue to focus on high priority areas of clinical care, monitoring of process and outcome indicators ; redesigning processes and systems and providing education to foster improvement , Positioning Specialty Surgery Center to achieve earning expectations and maintain effective cost-containment strategies while providing high quality of patient care, and Meeting the expectations of external regulatory and accrediting bodies through the identification of opportunities to improve patient care, demonstration of appropriate action taken, and follow up on the effectiveness of action taken. Strategies will be incorporated in each of the following areas to identify opportunities and set goals to achieve and sustain the desired results: Performance Improvement Processes Quality studies Risk Management Strategies Patient Safety Infection Control Strategies Medication Safety Radiation Safety HCA Patient Safety Organization (PSO), LLC HCA establishe d a Patient Safety Organization, LLC in spring of 2014 in accordance with provisions of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (Public Law 109- 41). The PSO is a component of its parent entity, HCA. The mission of the PSO is to conduct activities to improve patient safety and the quality of healthcare delivery. The vision is to assist participating providers in the elimination of preventable patient harm. The activities of the organization include: Improve patient safety and the quality of health care delivery Collect and analyze Patient Safety Work Product (PSWP) Develop and disseminate information regarding patient safety - 2 - Utilize PSWP to encourage a culture of safety and provide assistance to effectively minimize patient risk Maintain procedures to preserve confidentiality and provide appropriate security of PSWP Utilize qualified medical personnel Operate a patient safety evaluation system (PSES) and provide feedback to participants of the PSO. In early 2016 Specialty Surgery Center will begin to participate as a member of the HCA Patient Safety Organization (PSO), LLC. The Administrator will serve as the designated PSO Contact and oversees all activities of the PSO for the center. The Risk/Quality Manager shall serve as the Contact Designee. The center will provide patient safety work products (PSWP) documents as requested by the PSO. The center will receive information from the PSES to evaluate opportunities for improving patient safety and quality care. All information submitted will rem ain confidential within the PSO. Quality Improvement Plan The Center maintains an ongoing quality improvement program that has a broad scope to address administrative, clinical, and cost effective performance. The program also addresses patient outcomes, patient care processes and patient safety. Elements of the program include, but are not limited to a: Written plan that addresses the scope of health care services provided by the Center and how the quality improvement plan for these services is assessed. Interdisciplinary QI committee for the development, implementation, review and oversight of the program. The committee has administrative, clinical and physician participation. Set of goals and objectives that a re reviewed and updated at least annually. Quality improvement activities such as audits and studies to identify problems with processes or patient care, evaluate them, and dev elop action plans when indicated. The studies will be done utilizing the ten (10) step process that is current practice i n quality improvement. Measurement of data against internal and external benchmarking sources. Annual reviews of the effectiveness of the program . Periodic reports t o Governing Body that encompasses a summary of the quality improvement activities, finding s and process changes if indicated. Risk Management and Pat ient Safety Definitions of Potential Risk Issues: Event: A discrete, auditable and clearly defined occurrence (NWF) Occurrence: the action, fact, or instance of something that happens synony mous with an event. An event, situation, or process that contributes to, or has the potential to contribute to, a patient or visitor injury, or degrade our ability to provide optimal patient care. Reportable occurrences can generally be divided into the f ollowing types based on severity: Sentinel events, patient and visitor injuries, (adverse events), near misses, and safety concerns. (NPSF) Incident: Synonymous with occurrence or event. An occurrence or event that interrupts normal procedure and can precipitate an untoward or unplanned outcome. An unusual event that occurs at the facility , such as an injury to a patient. Involved damage that is limited to parts of a unit, whether or not the patient was harmed (NWF). Adverse Event: Any deviation fro m usual medical care that causes an injury to the patient or poses a risk of harm. Events include errors, preventable adverse events, and hazards. An incident in which a patient is harmed (WHO). An injury or the risk thereof caused by medical management rather than the underlying disease. An untoward, undesirable, and usually unanticipated occurrence. An act of commission or omission arising during clinical care which causes physical and psychological injury to a - 3 - patient regardless of severity, (NQF & NPSF). Any injury caused by medical care. An adverse event does not imply \"error,\" \"negligence,\" or poor quality care. It simply indicates that an undesirable clinical outcome resulted from some aspect of diagnosis or therapy, not an underlying diseas e process (AHRQ). Adverse events may be preventable or non -preventable (WHO). Sentinel Event: A sentinel event is a patient safety event (not primarily related to the natural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition) that reaches the patient and results in any of the following (HCA policy definition): Death Permanent harm Severe temporary harm In the ambulatory surgical setting, an event is also considered sentinel if it is one of the following: Discharge of an infant to the wrong family. Abduction of any patient receiving care, treatment, and services Any elopement (that is, unauthorized departure) of a patient, leading to death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm to the patient Hemolytic transfusion reaction involving administration of blood or blood products having major blood group incompatibilities (ABO, Rh, other blood groups) Rape, assault (leading to death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm), or homicide of any patient receiving care, treatment, and services while on site at the hospital Rape, assault (leading to death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm), or homicide of a staff member, licensed independent practitioner, visitor, or vendor while on site at the hospital Invasive procedure, including surgery, on the wr ong patient, at the wrong site, or that is the wrong (unintended) procedure Unintended retention of a foreign object in a patient after an invasive procedure, including surgery Prolonged fluoroscopy with cumulative dose > 1,500 rads to a single field. Fire, flame, or unanticipated smoke, heat, or flashes occurring during an episode of patient care Close Call: Events or situations that could have resulted in an adverse event (accident, injury, or illness), but did not, whether by chance or through timely intervention. Such events have also been referred to as \"near miss\" incidents. An example of a close call would be a surgery or other procedure almost performed on the wrong patient due to lapses in verification of patient identification, but caught prior to the procedure (Source: VA Patient Safety Program). Reportable Event: Any event that is mandated to report by regulatory agencies or corporate within defined time frame. (HCA, CMS, FDA, SMDA, and/or local/state agencies). Root Cause Analysis (RC A): A method of problem solving that tries to identify the root causes of faults or problems. RCA practice tries to solve problems by attempting to identify and correct the root causes of events, as opposed to simply addressing their symptoms. By focus ing correction on root causes, problem recurrence can be prevented. An analysis is done after an event has occurred. All staff members involved, as well as, the Risk Manager, physicians involved shall participate in the root cause analysis. RCA is typic ally used as a reactive method of identifying event(s) causes, revealing problems and solving them. The RCA findings are reported at the quality meetings, MEC and GB meetings. In 2016 the ASD will be moving toward an online program for analysis of serious events called Serious Event Analysis (SEA). The center maintains an ongoing risk management program that is designed to protect the life, safety and welfare of the patients and employees. Risk management addresses strategies from the - 4 - organizational, operational, human resource and liability areas of the organization. Goals of the program include: Improving patient safety and reducing risk to patients; Reducing medical/health system errors and hazardous conditions by creating an environment in which patients, their families, surgery center staff, and medical staff are able to identify and manage actual or potential risks to patient safety Reviewing and tracking of all incident reports and litigations for trends. Reviewing and tracking of all adverse outcomes, near misses or sentinel events to identify gaps or opportunities for improvement . Maintaining a strong credentialing and privileging process and current bylaws that meet community standards Keeping abreast of current standards for risk management and adapting practice and policies that mee t these standards. It is evident through the goals, activities and processes that the quality improvement and risk management programs intertwine and cross all spectrums of the organization. Quality care, as well as patient and employee safety is at the center focus of both programs. The operational linkage between Risk Management, Safety, Quality and Infection Control is accomplished through the following mechanisms: Issues or trends identified through chart reviews, peer reviews or safety rounds are discussed and referred to the appropriate department for evaluation and/or corrective action Data from variances, identified trends, adverse events or any events that impact the quality or safety of patient care will be reviewed and referred to appropriate department/leader for investigation, analysis and corrective action The Risk M anager will review current issues and risk reduction strategies with appropriate personnel and develop a plan of action. This will b e reported to MEC/GB. The Quality Committee will serve as the oversight committee for Patient Safety and Risk management. Medication Safety and Radiation Safety fall within a subsection of the Quality Committee and will be addressed as indicated. These plans engage active involvement of all members of the healthcare team, as well as patients and families, addressing an environment which: Encourages recognition and acknowledgment of opportunities to improve quality performance and to reduce risks to patient safety , Initiates actions to improve processes or reduce these risks , Encourages internal reporting of what has been found and the actions taken; Focuses on processes and system , Minimizes individual blame or retribution for involvement in a medical/health care error; and Challenges leaders of the organization to be responsible for fostering a \"non punitive\" culture of continuous improvement and creating a safe environment. Peer Review Ambulatory Surgery Centers are required by AAAHC, CMS, and other r egulatory agencies to conduct quality improvement and peer review. Peer review activities include ongoing random review, specialty specific review and review of complications. Cases with complications are reviewed by the physicians within the same specialty as the physician under review. Whenever possible to avoid conflict of interest, peer review cases will be referred to physicians who are not affiliated with the practitioner being reviewed, and no physician will review a patient's care in which - 5 - she/he has been professionally involved. Provisions are made to have cases evaluated by an outside expert when necessary Confidentiality All quality improvement and peer review activities and data are considered confidential. Any requests for outside sources for any QI, Risk M anagement, Peer Review or credentialing information or reports will be forwarded to the appropriate HCA administrative/corporate staff when indicated.

At least annually, a review of the process and accomplishment s will be conducted through an appropriate mechanism. Clinical leaders will receive periodic training on any updates to initiatives , new statistical reporting or other information as indicated. Ongoing Measurement Ongoing measurement is overseen by the Quality/ Risk Manager in collaboration with the Facility Administrator and Medical Director. These are outlined on the addendum to this plan . Design of New Processes When Specialty Surgery Center is considering a new process (for example, providing a new patient service, constructing a new facility, or redesigning an existing service), a multidisciplinary team will be convened to ensure that the process considers: The organization's mission, vision and strategic plans; Patient and community needs ; Information about performance and outcomes of the process (including information from reference data bases). Current evidence based practice and research Current regulatory standards Periodic Assessment and Improvement Based on ongoing review of measurement data, this plan provides for assessment of data against historical trends and available benchmarks whenever possible. All measures are reviewed quarterly by the Quality Committee , Medical Executive Committee and Governing Board. Assessment is automatically triggered for any of the following: By any sentinel event; By important undesirable single events, which include at a minimum: o Credentialing or bylaw violation o \"Near miss\" event o Significant injury or death - 8 - o Any significant untoward event during moderate sedation or anesthesia; o Any serious adverse drug or medication error event; and o Any significant hazardous condition. o Any significant infection control breech or trend By important undesirable patterns or trends, which include at a minimum: o Staffing effectiveness or clinical issues; o Any quality measure that varies substantially from an expected range; and o When the organization's performance significantly varies below that of other ambulatory surgery settings or recognized standards . Select quality data is submitted to corporate and trended with internal benchmarks across the company. This information is shared at the facility, division and corporate level. This information is used to develop corporate wide quality and risk initiatives and for external benchmarking in the ambulatory surgery arena. In addition to ongoing measurement, the center may at any time proactively assess its culture of patient safety as well as specific processes of care that have been within the healthcare industry as having the potential to harm patients. Also the center may periodically assess processes using tools provided from a variety of outside sources to identify potential risks to patients and opportunities for improvement.

Measuring performance through standardized data collection and utilization of data measur ement to assess current performance: The Surgical Center at Tenaya PERFORMANCE/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT and PATIENT SAFETY PLAN 5 Data collected for high priority and required areas are used to monitor the stability of existing processes, identify opportunities for improvements, identify changes that lead to improvement, and sustain the improveme nt. Data collection helps identify specific areas that require further study. These areas are determined by reviewing the information provided by the data regarding process stability, risks, adverse/sentinel events, and priorities set by leaders. The Surgi cal Center at Tenaya also identifies those areas in need of improvement and notes desired changes. Performance measures are utilized to determine whether the changes result in desired outcomes. The Surgical Center at Tenaya defines the frequency and detail of data collection. Sources of identifiable problems may include, but are not limited to: 1. Unacceptable or unexpected outcomes of ongoing monitoring of care, such as; complications, hospital transfers, malpractice cases, lack of fol low-up on abnormal test results, radiology film retakes, medical errors, medication variances , falls, infections, specific misdiagnoses, near misses, etc. 2. Clinical performance and practice patterns of health care professionals 3. Clinical record review 4. Variances from expected results identifie d by quality control processes, diagnostic imaging, pathology, medical laboratory and pharmaceutical services. 5. Patient satisfaction surveys 6. Review of Contract services 7. Direct observation of pro cesses and practices 8. Staff concerns 9. Access to care and/or timeliness of services 10. Medical/legal issues 11. Wasteful practices 12. Over -utilization or under -utilization of services 13. Testing of new or enhanced processes or methods of care 14. Benchmarking against best practices Utilization Review: Utilization Review is a formal assessment of the medical necessity, efficiency, and/or appropriateness of health care services and treatment plans on a prospective, concurrent or retrospective basis. The center provides for the review of center and medical services furnished by the center and medical staff to all patients including those entitled to benefits under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Criteria that may be included in a complete utilizati on review include appropriateness of admissions, length of stay, and discharge, appropriateness of pre -op diagnostic testing, a review of drugs and biologicals, accurate ASA classification, appropriate use of anesthesia, a review of block time, case mix an d volume by partners and non -partners, and a review of payer mix. Incident reports, medical record reviews, peer review documents, and information system reports will be used to collate this data. After analysis, this information will be reported to the Qu ality Council and the Governing Body per facility policy and Bylaws on a quarterly basis. The Governing Body shall review the assessed elements of Utilization Review annually and revise as necessary. B. Specific Measurements Required 1.

Monitoring of important aspects of care by individual practitioners, as well as practitioners in the aggregate is necessary for monitoring individual performance and establishing internal benchmarks. Identification of data related to established criteria will be conducted to evaluate and analyze the frequency, severity, and source of the suspected problems or concerns. Re-measurement of identified trends and/or problems will be conducted to determine obj ectively whether the corrective actions have achieved and sustained demonstrable improvement. The facility le adership shall be responsible for follow -up on findings of the Quality Council to ensure that effective corrective actions have been taken. Impleme ntation of corrective actions includes but is not limited to: Policy and procedure revisions Updates to facility specific programs/proc esses, i.e., Infection Control, Medication Management, etc. Education, training and competency updates Systematic collec tion and data analysis will be conducted related to identified performance, process and outcomes measures. Validity and reliability of data is ensured. Reporting, reviewing and appropriate analysis of all incidents reported by employees, patients, and healthcare professionals and others will be reviewed by the Quality Council, including all deaths, trauma, other adverse events, medical errors, patient complaints, and clinical records/policies . The Surgical Center at Tenaya PERFORMANCE/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT and PATIENT SAFETY PLAN 7 Data are systematically aggregated and analyzed Data rel ated to established criteria are collected in an ongoing manner and are periodically evaluated to identify acceptable or unacceptable trends or occurrences that affect patient outcomes. This is addressed through incident reports and quarterly data collecti on of mandatory reporting items. Data are aggregated at the frequency appropriate to the activity or process being studied The Surgical Center at Tenaya collects and aggregates (summarizes) data quarterly for mandatory reporting items, while all varianc es are reported monthly. Statistical tools and techniques are used to analyze and display dat a such as run charts, cause and effect diagrams, flowcharts, Pareto charts, histograms, and control charts to turn data into information. Data are analyzed and compared internally over time and externally with other sources of information when available. Comparative data are used to determine if there is excessive variability or unacceptable levels of performance when available. Undesirable patterns or trends in performance are analyzed. Analysis is performed when data comparisons indicate that level of performance, patterns or trends vary substantially from those expected. This is addressed via variance and sentinel event reporting on the Quantros System and the facility Quality Council and maintained in the meeting minutes. Analysis occurs for those topics chosen by leaders as performance improvement priorities. This is addressed via data collection when reported to the Quality Council. Analysis is perform ed when undesirable variation occurs which changes priorities. This is addressed via variance reporting and data collection when reported to the Quality Council. An analysis is performed for the following: 1. All confirmed transfusion reactions, if app licable 2. All se rious adverse drug events, as defined by the facility 3. All adverse patient events and patterns of a dverse events during anesthesia use 4. All significant medical and medication errors, as defined by the facility 5.

IDENTIFYING AND MANAGING OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT A. The Quality Council will review and analyze dat a to identify opportunities for improvement. Opportunities for improvement may also result from m eaningful feedback submitted by teammates or providers. This feedback is documented on the Opportunity for Improvement Form (OFI) and submitted to the Quality Council for review. The following questions sh ould be addressed wh en identifying improvement opportunities . Does it: Improve quality? Respond to a new directive? Support the strategic goals? Respond to complaints? The Surgical Center at Tenaya PERFORMANCE/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT and PATIENT SAFETY PLAN 13 Address problems? Address readiness issues? Address resource issues? Respond to external competition? Respond to new trends? Respond to new technology? Respond to change in mission? Address accreditation or regulatory requirements? Other? B. Facility leadership (Administrative, Clinical, MEC and GB) prioritizes performance improvement activities reported u p through Facility Quality Council to MEC and GB. Priorities are set for performance improvement, considering the prevalence and severity of identified problems, and priority given to improvement activities that affect patient safety, clinical outcomes and quality of care . A determinatio n of which improvement to pursue is done through a priority grid that measures each improvement opportunity against established criterion . A new process/service is designed or the current process design is analy zed to identify key variables in the process and opportunities to simplify. The process must be cost -effective, defect free and operate at a very high level of performance. Criteria for designing new processes and services and/or the indicated improvement of existing processes or services shall be based on the follow ing assessment: 1. Is it consistent with the facility/center mission, vision and resources (human, financial and physical)? 2. Is the area targeted for improvement a high risk, high volume or problem prone process? 3. Are the needs and expectations of all customers (patients, staff, community, MDs, payors and others) considered? 4. Is the desig n or improvement effort based upon up -to-date sources of information (common practice guidelines, professional literature, and the input of experts in the field)? 5. Is the performance of the processes and its outcomes in other organizations (external databases) used to provide information on performance as it relates to peers in the industry? 6. Has the process been developed with input from all relevant sources? 7. Has the process been approved by the Quality Council, Medical Executive Committee and Governing Body? C. A multidisciplinary team is identified to implement the new or redesigned process . A facilitator from the Quality Council will ensure there is common understanding and project agreement among the Performance Improvement team members. The Performance Improvement team includes memb ers who have a level of shared knowledge about the task and are familiar with all the different parts of the process \u2014 managers and administrators as well as those who work in the process, including physicians, nurses, and front -line workers . CAUTION: DO N OT \"elevate\" and issue to a PI team if it can be easily resolved by normal operational decisions. These easily resolved performance improvement activities are documented utilizing the Qu ick Fix Project form. The PI team collects data and assesses it in ord er to determine: 1. Whether intended specifications for new processes are met. The Surgical Center at Tenaya PERFORMANCE/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT and PATIENT SAFETY PLAN 14 2. The level of performance stability of existing important processes. 3. The priorities for improving existing processes. 4. Actions to improve the performance of processes. 5. Whether chan ges in the processes resulted in improvement. 6. Special causes vs. common cause variation. 7. Patient Safety is being addresse d B. The Performance Im provement Team will complete a Performance Improvement Update prior to ea ch facility Quality Council Meeting to keep the council abreast of the project's progress . C. The facility Quality Council shall direct the implementation of changes that are identified through Performance I mprovement Teams and Leadership recommendations. These improvements shall have the following characteristics: 1. May use trial basis/pilot project for implementation and to determine effectiveness of solution: if solutions are not effective, other solutions are then developed/tried. 2. The effect of the improv ement is assessed, and if there is success it is implemented facility wide as appropriate. 3. Improvement efforts shall be directed at processes, not individuals. However, if an individual has performance problems that he or she is unable or unwilling to impr ove, his or her clinical privileges or job assignment are modified, as indicated, or other appropriate action will be taken via medical staff peer review, or according to the contractual terms, or departmental Human Resource policies. D. All performance impr ovement activities are reported up to the Governing Body. The leadership allocates adequate resources for improvem ent and assures that all teammates are trained and educated about assessing and improvin g processes that contribute to improved facility outco mes. Leadership fosters communication among individuals and components of the organization to improve the coordination of activities. The Surgical Center at Tenaya PERFORMANCE/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT and PATIENT SAFETY PLAN 15 Clinical Practice Guideline Development Resource Sheet Remember some of the goals for developing CPGs: Reducing Variation and probability of Adverse Events. Providing a specific standard of care to enhance patient safety and outcomes. Allowing for specific outcomes monitoring and benchmarking of best practices. Guide for developing CPGs: CPGs are used in designing or improving processes that evaluate and treat specific diagnoses, conditions and/or symptoms. Make sure you define specifically what you are designing and/or improving. What is your mission? What did you identify in your literature review of evidence -based practice that led you to design and/or improve this process? What is your baseline data? Did you collect data retrospectively from Medical Records and/or develop a tool to complete an initial assessment of the current situation? What % of negative outcomes have you had specific to the process you are addressing? What % of MD compliance do you have initially (before implementation of the CPG)? Do certain MDs have better outcomes than others with respect to your identified process (before implementation of the CPG)? Make sure you identify SPECIFICALLY what you are taking from your baseline data and evidence -based literature and applying to develop your CPG and why. The ASC's leaders identify criteria for the selection and implementation of CPGs. You should be reviewing your facility's Scope of Service and your Approved Procedure List to identify high volume, high risk and problem prone procedures in your center. You should be addressing CPGs that affect those populations first. Remember to note your baseline data as part of the criteria that helped you choose to implement this particular CPG. Once you complete your literature review and initial assessment (Baseline data) and you have determined what process changes you will implement, make SURE you specify a quantitative goal for improvement/compliance. (What % compliance do you expect from MDs? What % reduction in negative outcomes do you expect initially?) Appropriate leaders, practitioners and healthcare professionals in the organization review and approve the CPG selected for implementation. Who is involved in the design/implementation of this CPG? Make sure you have a multidisciplinary team identified with physicians included. Make sure it is well -documented throughout your project ( minutes, etc) so that it is obvious that this was a joint effort in design and approval. Leaders evaluate the outcomes related to the use of CPGs and refine guidelines to improve processes. The Surgical Center at Tenaya PERFORMANCE/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT and PATIENT SAFETY PLAN 16 After you complete your initial assessment (baseline data) and i mplement your CPG, did you develop some tool to review compliance/success with your CPG? i.e. How are you monitoring the success of your implementation so you will have data to compare with your baseline? Is that comparison data being reported at QC and MEC to meet the standard? Are you tying MD compliance to your CPG with patient outcomes and utilizing this in the reappointment review? If the literature changes regarding your guideline, are you updating the process as time passes? Implementation of Cli nical Practice Guidelines to improve quali ty and reduce variation of care in specific diagnoses, conditions or symptoms. A clinical practice guideline (CPG) can improve the quality utilization and value of healthcare services. CPGs help practitione rs make decisions about the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of specific conditions. Facility leadership must identify, select and implement CPGs appropriate to the patient populations served. CPGs must be approved by the facility leadershi p and monitored for compliance after implementation. A CPG provides an effective way to improve process(es) by reducing variation . This is not to say that there will never be variation. The variation should, however, be evaluated to better manage the process/procedure/ practice. 1. Administrative and Clinical (MEC) Leadership will discuss the most appropriate processes, procedures or diagnoses based on services provided at the facility (Scope of S ervices and approved procedure list to be reviewed ). Rev iew only one process, procedure or diagnosis at a time prioritize using high volume, high risk or problem prone areas. 2. Review clinical practice guidelines for the chosen project via literature review. 3. Leaders will apply the PI Priority Grid to the proce dures and diagnoses identified in step one to identify the CPG that scores the highest. 4. The leaders will then identify an appropriate team to develop the first CPG with an identified time frame for development and chairperson. Required do cumentation for CPG: Data (as applicable) to support the need for the CPG (consider a report similar to the PI project summary report. Literature (as applicable) to support the published best practice used in the CPG Priority key if more than one CPG is c onsidered Meeting minutes demonstrating discussion and decisions related to the CPG, both of the Quality Council and MEC/Governing body. CPG documen t or statement (it is encouraged to keep CPG's separate from policies and not write a CPG up as a policy) . In summary: Accreditation s tandards require that CPG's are implemented but the frequency is not defined. For CPG's in place, monitor for effectiveness and revise (update) as applicable. Annually look for opportunities to implement a new CPG. It should be the result of identifying some variability or lack of a standardized/best practice process in the facility. CPG's commonly result from a PI project or a publicly identified patient safety issue. The MEC looks at, considers, The Surgical Center at Tenaya PERFORMANCE/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT and PATIENT SAFETY PLAN 17 and makes a decision to implement or not and the discussion and decision is documented in the minutes. Educate and monitor for compliance! Implementation of a Facility -Specific Patient Safety P rogram Facility leadership facilitates a safe environment by ensuring that safet y priorities are integrated into all applicable processes in the organization. Each component of the Performance Improvement Plan compliments the Patient Safety Program by reducing the risk of process failures via performance improvement projects, and cli nical practice guidelines. Implementation of the National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs), the Universal Protocol for Prevention of Wrong Site, Wrong Person and Wrong Procedure Surgery and evaluation and review of Sentinel Event Alerts offer additional value to the Facility Patient Safety Program. The patient safety program includes the following: 1. Management of the program by the Facility Quality Council and additional employees as indicated 2. Oversight of unanticipated events whether they be no harm, near miss or actual Sentinel Events 3. Assurance by the Facility Quality Council to integrate the Patient Safety Program into all elements of the Facility 4.

(800) 538- 6264PURPOSE: The purpose of the organizational Patient Safety Plan at Seven Hills Surgery Center is to improve patient safety and reduce risk to patients through an environment that encourages: Integration of safety priorities into all relevant organization processes, functions andservices Recognition and acknowledgment of risks to patient safety and medical/health careerrors The initiation of actions to reduce these risks The internal reporting of what has been found and the actions taken A focus on processes and systems, and the reduction of process and systemfailures through use of failure mode effect analysis Minimization of individual blame or retribution for involvement in a medical/healthcare error Organizational learning about medical/health care errors Support of the sharing of that knowledge to effect behavioral changes in itself andother healthcare organizations The Patient Safety Plan provides a systematic, coordinated and continuous approach tothe maintenance and improvement of patient safety through the establishment ofmechanisms that support effective responses to actual occurrences; ongoing proactivereduction in medical/health care errors; and integration of patient safety priorities into thenew design and redesign of all relevant organization processes, functions and services. As patient care, and therefore the maintenance and improvement of patient safety, is acoordinated and collaborative effort, the approach to optimal patient safety involvesmultiple departments and disciplines in establishing the plans, processes and mechanismsthat comprise the patient safety activities at Seven Hills Surgery Center. The PatientSafety Plan outlines the components of the organizational Patient Safety Program.SEVEN HILLS SURGERY CENTERSUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY PLAN REFERENCE #6016 PAGE: 2 OF: 10 APPROVED BY: Board of Managers REVISED: 2/2010km Ambulatory \u00a9 Medical Consultants Network Inc. (800) 538- 6264 PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAM: Scope of Activities: The scope of the Patient Safety Program includes an ongoing assessment, using internal and external knowledge and experience, to prevent error occurrence, maintain and improve patient safety. Patient safety occurrence information from aggregated data reports and individual incident occurrence reports will be reviewed by the Quality Assurance Committee to prioritize organizational patient safety activity efforts. Types of patient safety or medical/health care errors included in data analysis are: No Harm Errors - those unintended acts, either of omission or commission, or acts that do not achieve their intend outcome - that do not result in a physical or psychological negative outcome, or the potential for a negative outcome, for the patient. Mild-Moderate Adverse Outcome Errors - those unintended acts, either of omission or commission, or acts that do not achieve their intend outcome, that result in an identified mild to moderate physical or psychological adverse outcome for the patient. Any Medication Error Any Adverse Drug Reaction Any Transfusion Reaction Hazardous Condition - any set of circumstances, exclusive of the disease or condition for which the patient is being treated, which significantly increases the likelihood of a serious physical or psychological adverse patient outcome.

(800) 538- 6264 Sentinel Event - an unexpected event or occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury or the risk thereof - including any process variation for which a recurrence would c arry a significant chance of serious adverse outcome. Serious injury specifically includes loss of limb or function. Sentinel event criteria includes: The event has resulted in an unexpected death or major permanent loss of function, not related to the natural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition, or An event is one (1) of the following (even if the outcome was not death or major permanent loss of function unrelated to the natural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition): Abduction of any patient receiving care Infant abduction or discharge to the wrong family Rape (by another patient, visitor or staff) Surgery or invasive procedure performed on the incorrect patient or incorrect body part The unintentional retenti on of a foreign object, i.e., sponge, instrument, in a postoperative or postinvasive procedure patient All identified cases of unanticipated death or major permanent loss of function associated with a healthcare associated infection Prolonged fluoroscopy with cumulative dose greater than 1,500 rads to a single field, or any delivery of radiotherapy to the wrong body region or greater than 25% above the prescribed radiotherapy dose Near Miss - any process variation which did not affect the outcome, but for which a recurrence carries a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome.

(800) 538- 6264 The scope of the Patient Safety Program encompasses the patient population, visitors, volunteers and staff (including medical staff). The program addresses maintenance and improvement in patient safety issues in every department throughout the facility. There will be an emphasis on important facility and patient care functions of: Ethics, Rights and Responsibilities Provision of Care, Treatment and Services Medication Management Surveillance, Prevention and Control of Infection Improving Organization Performance Leadership Management of the Quality Assurance Management of Human Resources Management of Information SUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY PLAN REFERENCE #6016 PAGE: 5 OF: 10 APPROVED BY: Board of Managers REVISED: 2/2010km \u00a9 Medical Consultants Network Inc. (800) 538- 6264 Methodology: The Quality Assurance Committee is r esponsible for the oversight of the Patient Safety Program. All departments within the organization (patient care and non- patient care departments) are responsible to report patient safety occurrences and potential occurrences to the Quality Assurance C ommittee , who will aggregate oc currence information and create a report on a quarterly basis. The report will contain aggregated information related to type of occurrence, severity of occurrence, number/type of occurrences per department, occurrence impac t on the patient, remedial actions t aken, and patient outcome. The Committee will analyze the report information and determine further patient safety activities as appropriate. Through review of internal data reports and reports from external sources (including, but not limited to, Joint Commission sentinel event report information, ORYX and Core Measure performance data, occurrence reporting information from state and federal sources and current literature), the Quality Assurance Committee will select at least one high- risk safety process for proactive risk assessment annually. All elements of the high- risk safety related process will be described using work tools as necessary (i.e., flowcharts, cause and effect diagrams). The proactive risk assessment will include: Identification of the ways in which the process could break down or fail to perform. This will be done through assessment of the intended and actual implementation of the process to identify the steps in the process where there is, or may be, undesirable variation. Identify the possible effects of the undesirable variation on patients, and how serious the possible effect on the patient could be Prioritizing the potential processes breakdowns or failures SUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY PLAN REFERENCE #6016 PAGE: 6 OF: 10 APPROVED BY: Board of Managers REVISED: 2/2010km Ambulatory \u00a9 Medical Consultants Network Inc. (800) 538- 6264 For the most critical effects, conduct a root cause analysis to determine why the undesirable variation leading to that effect may occur Redesign the process and/or underlying systems to minimize the risk of that undesirable variation or to protect patients from the effects of that undes irable variation Test and implement the redesigned process Identify and implement measures of the effectiveness of the redesigned process Implement a strategy for maintaining the effectiveness of the redesigned process over time Description of mechanis ms to ensure that all components of the healthcare organization are integrated into and participate in the organizationwide program. Upon identification of a process or system failure and/or medical/health care error, the patient care provider will immedi ately: Perform necessary healthcare interventions to protect and support the patient's clinical condition. As appropriate to the occurrence, perform necessary healthcare interventions to contain the risk to others - example: immediate removal of contaminated IV fluids from floor stock should it be discovered a contaminated lot of fluid solutions was delivered and stocked. Contact the patient's attending physician and other physicians, as appropriate, to report the error, carrying out any physician orders as necessary. Preserve any information related to the error (including physical information). Examples of preservation of physical information are: Removal and preservation of blood unit for a suspected transfusion reaction; preservation of IV tubing, fluids bags and/or pumps for a patient with a severe drug reaction from IV medication; preservation of medication label for medications administered to the incorrect patient. Preservation of information includes documenting the facts regarding the error on an occurrence report, and in the medical record as appropriate to organizational policy and procedure.

(800) 538- 6264 Report the process/system failure or medical/health care error to the staff member's immediate supervisor. Any individual in any department identifyi ng a process/system failure and/or potential patient safety issue will immediately notify his or her supervisor and document the findings on an occurrence report. The occurrence report will be submitted to the administrator. Staff response to process/sys tem failures and/or medical/health care errors is dependent upon the type of error identified: No Harm Failures or Errors - (including \"no harm\" medication errors) - staff will document appropriately in the medical record according to organizational policy, document the circumstances regarding the no harm error on an occurrence r eport form, submit the form to Administration and notify their immediate supervisor. Mild-Moderate Adverse Outcome Failures or Errors (including medication errors) - staff will pe rform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect the patient and notify the physician staff responsible for the patient, carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will then preserve any physical evidence as appropriate, notify hi s/her immediate supervisor, document facts appropriately in the medical record and on an occurrence report - submitting the report to the Quality Assurance Committee. Medication Errors - the staff member identifying a medication error (no harm and mil d-moderate harm) will notify Administration of the event. Adverse Drug Reaction - staff will perform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect the patient and notify the physician staff responsible for the patient, carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will then preserve any physical evidence as appropriate, notify his/her immediate supervisor, document facts appropriately in the medical record and on an occurrence report, submitting the report to Quality Assurance Committee. Staff will als o notify Administration. Hazardous Condition/Patient Safety Issue - as appropriate, and if possible, staff will contain the hazardous condition or patient safety issue. Staff identifying a hazardous condition or potential patient safety issue will immediately notify his or her supervisor and document the findings on an occurrence report. The occurrence report will be submitted to the Quality Assurance Committee per organizational policy.

(800) 538- 6264 Sentinel Event - staff will perform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect the patient and notify the physician staff responsible for the patient, carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will then follow the organizational Sentinel Event Policy and Procedure. Near Miss - staff will report the near miss event to his/her immediate supervisor, describe the facts of the near miss on an occurrence report and submit the report to the Performance Improvement Department. All medication errors and adverse drug reactions will also be r eported to the consulting Pharmacist. Established organizational policy (such as the Sentinel Event Policy) and/or the Quality Assurance Committee will determine the organizational response to process/system failures and/or medical/health care err ors and occurrences. All sentinel events and near miss occurrences will have a root cause analysis conducted. The determination of the Quality Assurance Committee members, based on internal and external data analysis and prioritizing of patient safety criticality, will determine: Further remedial action activities necessary for identified occurrences Proactive occurrence reduction activities Necessity and benefit of root cause analysis performance for identified occurrences or proactive reduction activ ities SUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY PLAN REFERENCE #6016 PAGE: APPROVED BY: Board of Managers REVISED: 2/2010km Ambulatory \u00a9 Medical Consultants Network Inc. (800) 538- 6264 An effective Patient Safety Program cannot exist without optimal reporting of process/system failures and medical/health care errors and occurrences. Therefore, it is the intent of this institution to adopt a non- punitive approach in its management of failures, errors and occurrences. All personnel are required to report suspected and identified medical/health care errors, and should do so without the fear of reprisal in relationship to their employment. This organization supports the concept that errors occur due to a breakdown in systems and processes, and will focus on improving systems and processes, rather than disciplining those responsible for errors and occurrences. A focus will be placed on remedial actions to assist rather than punish s taff members, with the Quality Assurance Committee and the individual staff member's department supervisor determining the appropriate course of action to prevent error recurrence. Sentinel Events - staff members involved in a sentinel event occurrence wi ll receive support from the Quality Assurance Committee regarding the staff member's professional and emotional reconciliation of the sentinel event. The Quality Assurance Committee encourages the staff member's involvement in the root cause analysis and action plan processes, to allow the staff member an active role in process resolution. Additionally, any staff member involved in a sentinel event or other medical/health care error may request and receive supportive personal counseling from Human Resourc es Department and/or his or her department supervisor. As part of this organization's culture of safety, any staff member who has concerns about the safety or quality of care provided by the organization may report these concerns to The Joint Commission. The organization supports the staff member's right to report these concerns and will take no disciplinary or retaliatory action against the staff member for reporting the safety or quality of care concern to The Joint Commission. On at least an annual basis, staff will be queried regarding their willingness to report medical/health care errors.

(800) 538- 6264 The Patient Safety Program includes implementation of the recommendations set forth by The Joint Commission, or identified alternative recommendations defined by this institution, to achieve compliance with the Joint Commission established National Patient Safety Goals. The selected recommendations will be monitored on a routine basis to evaluate the organization's effectiveness in the implementation of the recom mendations in achieving compliance with the identified National Patient Safety Goals. Staff will receive education and training during their initial orientation process and on an ongoing basis regarding job- related aspects of patient safety, including the need and method to report medical/health care errors. Education includes the staff member's right to report any safety or quality of care concerns to The Joint Commission. And, because the optimal provision of healthcare is provided in an interdisciplin ary manner, staff will be educated and trained on the provision of an interdisciplinary approach to patient care. Medical/health care errors and occurrences, including sentinel events, will be reported internally and externally, per facility policy and through the channels established by this plan. External reporting will be performed in accordance with all state, federal and regulatory body rules, laws and requirements. Patient safety reports from the Quality Assurance Committee will be su bmitted to the Board of Managers. Our Annual Review of Care Plans and Quality Indicators Date _________ Period 2015- 2016 PSC Review ________ G oals we collect data, aggregate and analyze: We set priorities for our performance improvement activities (QAPI); we focus on high risk, high volume, and problem-prone areas. Items we consider, when selecting the measures/indicators that will shape our improvement activities in these areas . The following: incidence (rate or frequency), prevalence (how widespread something is in an ASC at a given point in time), severity (any single instance of a transfer, serious adverse event are items we consider . Outcomes Indicators measure results of care; typical outcomes measures include risk -adjusted mortality rates, complication rates, healthcare -associ ated infection rates, length of stay, readmission rates, etc. In the ASC setting, outcomes measures might focus on things like complication rates, healthcare -associated infection rates, cases exceeding 24 hours, transfers to hospitals, wrong site surgeries, etc. Process of Care Indicators measure how often the standard of care was met for patients with a diagnosis related to that standard. For example, we measure on the administration and time of prophylactic antibiotics. Patient Perception Indicators measure a patient's experience of the care he/she received in the ASC. We model our surveillance on the National Quality Forum 's (NQF) consensus standards for ASCs, and we use only illustration of several types of measures we chose to include in our QAPI p rogram below: Patient Burn - Percentage of ASC admissions experiencing a burn prior to discharge Prophylactic Intravenous Antibiotic Timing - Percentage of ASC patients who received appropriate antibiotics ordered for surgical site infection prophylaxis on time Hospital Transfer/Admission - Percentage of ASC admissions requiring a hospital transfer or hospital admission prior to being discharged from the ASC Patient Fall - Percentage of ASC admissions experiencing a fall in the ASC Wrong Site, Wrong Side, Wrong Patient, Wrong Procedure, and Wrong Implant - Percentage of ASC admissions experiencing a wrong site, wrong side, wrong patient, wrong procedure, or wrong implant.SEDATION DENTAL CENTERPlans Process Indicators Outcome or Event Indicators G oals # of Variances (track adverse patient events and patient care issues) Performance Improvement and Compliance Activities or Policy Changes QI Audits Completed Goals Met (Goals Indicated on Audits ) Scope Met Performance Met Effectiveness 1.Effective 2.Partially 3.Not E ffectiveRevi ew and update Policy and procedures (audits) annually or as needed C omments or Items to mitigate Safety F alls (Goal 0) P atient or Employees falls (Goal 0) 1 Employee needle stick N one N one - Emp.

Components of Patient Safety Plan Significant E vent/Significant Medica l Error - Any unexpected occurrence involving a death, serious physical or psychological injury or risk thereof. Serious injury specifically includes loss of limb or function. \"Risk thereof\" includes any process variation for which recurrence would carr y a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. Adverse Events \u2014any event where result is not consistent with the desired plan of care and that leads to patient harm not limited to medication error. Reportable E vents \u2014Mandatory Reporting of Sentinel Events to the Nevada Sentinel Events Registry. To Nevada State Health Division, Bureau of Health Planning and Statistics. Attention: Sentinel Events Registry, 4150 Technology Way, Suite 104, Carson City, NV 89706 HISTORY Nevada Assembly Bill 1 (AB1) was passed during the 2002 18th Special Legislative Session, and mandatory reporting of sentinel events was incorporated into Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 439.800 -890 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 439.900 -920. Assembly Bill 59 (AB59) was passed during the 2005 73rd Sessio n of the Nevada Legislature, and codified \"facility acquired infection\" as a reportable sentinel event. A \"sentinel event\" is defined as an unexpected occurrence involving facility -acquired infection, death or serious physical or psychological injury or t he risk thereof, including, without limitation, any process variation for which a recurrence would carry a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. The term includes loss of limb or function (NRS 439.830 ) It is called a sentinel event because it signals the need for immediate investigation and response.

Patient Safety Plan Premium Surgical Services Center Las Vegas, Nevada Originating Department: Environment of Care/Patient Safety Committee TITLE: Patient Safety Plan POLICY #: EOC - 1 The purpose of the Patient Safety Plan at Premium Surgical Services Center (PSSC) is to improve patient safety and reduce risk to patients through an environment that encourages: Recognition and ack nowledgment of risks to patient safety and medical/health errors; The initiation of actions to reduce these risks; The internal reporting of what has been found and the actions taken; A focus on processes and systems; Minimization of individual blame o r retribution for involvement in a medical/health care error Organizational learning about medical/health care errors; Support of the sharing of that knowledge to effect behavioral changes The Patient Safety Plan provides a systematic, coordinated and continuous approach to the maintenance and improvement of patient safety. This is accomplished through the establishment of mechanisms that support effective responses to actual occurrences; ongoing proactive reduction in medical/health care errors; and integration of patient safety priorities into the new design and redesign of all relevant organization processes, functions and services. As patient care, and therefore the maintenance and improvement of patient safety, is a coordinated and collaborativ e effort, the approach to optimal patient safety involves multiple departments and disciplines in establishing the plans, processes and mechanisms that comprise the patient safety activities at PSSC. The Patient Safety Plan developed by the interdisciplinary EOC/Patient Safety Committee outlines the components of the Patient Safety Program. PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAM: I. SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES: A. The scope of the Patient Safety Program includes an ongoing assessment, using internal and external knowl edge and experience, to prevent error occurrence and maintains and improves patient safety. Patient safety occurrence information from aggregated data reports and individual incident occurrence reports will be reviewed by the Environment of Care/Patient Sa fety Committee to prioritize organizational patient safety activity efforts. Types of patient safety or medical/health care errors included in data analysis are: 1. No Harm Errors - those unintended acts, either of omission or commission, or acts that do not achieve their intended outcome - that do not result in a physical or psychological negative outcome, or the potential for a negative outcome, for the patient 2. Mild-Moderate Adverse Outcome Errors - those unintended acts, either of omission or commission , or acts that do not achieve their intended outcome, that result in an identified mild to moderate physical or psychological adverse outcome for the patient 3. Any Medication Error 4. Any Adverse Drug Reaction 5. Any Transfusion Reaction 6. Hazardous Condition - any set of circumstances, exclusive of the disease or condition for which the patient is being treated, which significantly increases the likelihood of a serious physical or psychological adverse patient outcome chance of a serious adverse outcome. 7. Sentinel Event B. The scope of the Patient Safety Program encompasses the patient population, visitors, volunteers and staff (including Medical Staff). The program addresses maintenance and improvement in patient safety issues in every department throughout the facility. There will be an emphasis on important hospital and patient care functions of: 1. Patient Rights 2. Assessment of Patients 3. Care of Patients 4. Patient/Family Education 5. Continuum of Care 6. Leadership 7. Improving Organization Performance 8. Management of Information 9. Management of Human Resources 10. Management of the Environment of Care 11. Surveillance, Prevention, and Control of Infection II. METHODOLOGY: A. The Interdisciplinary EOC/Patient Safety Committee is responsible for the oversight of the Pati ent Safety Program. The EOC/Patient Safety Committee Chairperson will have administrative responsibility for the program, or the EOC/Patient Safety Committee may assign this responsibility to another member of the committee. B. All departments within the organization (patient care and non- patient care departments) are responsible to report patient safety occurrences and potential occurrences to the Administrator, who will aggregate occurrence information and present a report to the EOC/Patient Safety Comm ittee on a quarterly basis. The EOC/Patient Safety Committee will analyze the report information and determine further patient safety activities as appropriate. C. Through review of internal data reports and reports from external sources (including, but not limited to JCAHO sentinel event report information, ORYX and Core Measure performance data, occurrence reporting information from state and federal sources and current literature), and through the Performance Improvement priority criteria grid, the EO C/Patient Safety Committee will select at least one high- risk safety process for proactive risk assessment annually. The proactive risk assessment will include: 1. Assessment of the intended and actual implementation of the process to identify the steps in t he process where there is, or may be, undesirable variation. Identify the possible effects of the undesirable variation on patients, and how serious the possible effect on the patient could be. 2. For the most critical effects, conduct a root cause analysis t o determine why the undesirable variation leading to that effect may occur 3. Redesign the process and/or underlying systems to minimize the risk of that undesirable variation or to protect patients from the effects of that undesirable variation 4. Test and im plement the redesigned process 5. Identify and implement measures of the effectiveness of the redesigned process 6. Implement a strategy for maintaining the effectiveness of the redesigned process over time 7. Ensure that all components of the health care organi zation are integrated into and participate in the organization- wide program. D. Upon identification of a medical/health care error, the patient care provider will immediately: 1. Perform necessary healthcare interventions to protect and support the patient 's clinical condition 2. As appropriate to the occurrence, perform necessary healthcare interventions to contain the risk to others - example: immediate removal of contaminated IV fluids from floor stock should it be discovered a contaminated lot of fluid solutions was delivered and stocked 3. Contact the patient's physician and other physicians, as appropriate, to report the error, carrying out any physician orders as necessary. 4. Preserve any information related to the error (including physical information). Ex amples of preservation of physical information are: preservation of IV tubing, fluids bags and/or pumps for a patient with a severe drug reaction from IV medication; preservation of medication label for medications administered to the incorrect patient. Pr eservation of information includes documenting the facts regarding the error on an occurrence report, and in the medical record 5. Report the medical/health care error to the staff member's manager and Administrator. 6. Submit the occurrence report to the Administrator per organizational policy. E. Any individual in any department identifying a potential patient safety issue will immediately notify his or her manager and document the findings on an occurrence report. The occurrence report will be submitted to the Administrator F. Staff response to medical/health care errors is dependent upon the type of error identified: 1. No harm errors - (including \"no harm\" medication errors) - staff will document in the medical record the circumstances regarding the no har m error on an occurrence report form, submit the form to the Administrator and notify their immediate supervisor 2. Mild-Moderate Adverse Outcome Errors (including medication errors) - staff will perform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect the patient and notify the physician staff responsible for the patient, carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will then preserve any physical evidence as appropriate, notify his/her immediate supervisor, document facts in the medical rec ord and on an occurrence report - submitting the report to the Administrator. 3. Medication Errors - the staff member identifying a medication error (no harm and mild- moderate harm) will document facts on an occurrence report - submitting the report to the Administrator. 4. Adverse Drug Reaction - staff will perform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect the patient and notify the physician staff responsible for the patient, carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will then preserv es any physical evidence as appropriate; notify his/her manager and Administrator, document facts in the medical record and on an occurrence report - submitting the report to the Administrator. 5. Transfusion Reaction - We do not handle blood products at our facility. 6. Hazardous Condition/Patient Safety Issue - as appropriate, and if possible, staff will contain the hazardous condition or patient safety issue. Staff identifying a hazardous condition or potential patient safety issue will immediately notify his or her supervisor, take appropriate action and document the findings on an occurrence report. The occurrence report will be submitted to the Administrator. 7. Sentinel Event - staff will perform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect the patient and notify the physician staff responsible for the patient, and his/her manager and Administrator carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will then follow the organizational Sentinel Event Policy and Procedure document facts appropriately in the medical record and on an occurrence report - submitting the report to the Quality Management Division. 8. Near Miss - staff will report the near miss event to his/her manager, describe the facts of the near miss on an occurrence report and submit th e report to the Administrator. 9. At the direction of the Administrator of the Medical Staff all sentinel events and near miss occurrences will have a root cause analysis conducted. G. It is the intent of this organization to adopt a non- punitive approach in its management of errors and occurrences. All personnel are required to report suspected and identified medical/health care errors, and should do so without the fear of reprisal in relationship to their employment. H. The organization will focus on improving systems and processes and on remedial actions to assist rather than punish staff members. The Environment of Care/Patient Safety will review the course of action to prevent error recurrence. I. Sentinel Events - staff members involved in a sentinel event occurrence will receive support from the Administrator of the Medical Staff regarding the staff member's professional and emotional reconciliation of the sentinel event. The Environment of Care/Patient Safety and Care Oversight Committees encourage the staff member's involvement in the root cause analysis and action plan processes, to allow the staff member an active role in process resolution. Additionally, any staff member involved in a sentinel event or other medical/health care error may req uest and receive supportive personal counseling from the department supervisor J. On at least an annual basis, staff will be queried regarding their willingness to report medical/health care errors. K. The Patient Safety Program includes an annual sur vey of patients, their families, volunteers and staff (including medical staff) opinions, needs and perceptions of risks to patients and requests suggestions for improving patient safety. L. Patients, and when appropriate, their families are informed about the outcomes of care, including unanticipated outcomes, or when the outcomes differ significantly from the anticipated outcomes. The Environment of Care/Patient Safety Committee will receive a report verifying compliance with informing the patient about outcomes of care. M. Staff will educate patients and their families about their role in helping to facilitate the safe delivery of care. N. Staff will receive education and training during their initial orientation process and on an ongoing basis regarding job- related aspects of patient safety, including the need and method to report medical/health care errors. Staff will be educated and trained on the provision of an interdisciplinary approach to patient care O. Medical/health care errors and oc currences, including sentinel events, will be reported internally and externally, per hospital policy and through the channels established by this plan. External reporting will be performed in accordance with all state, federal and regulatory body rules, l aws and requirements. P. Quarterly reports from the Environment of Care/Patient Safety Committee will be submitted to the Quality Council, Care Oversight Committee of the Medical Staff and Board QI Committee, which exists as the oversight committee for t he Environment of Care/Patient Safety Committee.

Guidelines: 1. Combustible Storage Large quantities of combu stible storage should be avoided. Of special concern are loosely packed quantities of paper, cardboard, plastic, or Styrofoam which may ignite with relative ease and produce significant quantities of smoke. Additionally, fire codes require that combu stible materials not be stored at heights within 18 inches of the level of drop ceiling . This would apply in particular to open storage on top of cabinets and wall mounted cupboards. 2. Flammable Liquids Flammable liquids should be contained in approved flammable liquid containers, when storage levels exceed established quantity limitations as outlined in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards. The exception to this is when such containers render the liquid unsuitable for use. 3. Electrical Attention should be given to the electrical integrity of equipment, evidence of potential or actual cord or plug damage, the use of \"cheater\" plugs and the proximity of heat producing electrical equipm ent to combustible materials. Three to two prong adapters are strictly prohibited. Extension cords must be sized right for the application. 4. Barriers Barriers to minimize fire and/or smoke spread are important features of life safety. Fire and smoke doors should be maintained in a closed position at all times unless equipped with an automated smoke actuated 10 hold-open device. Door stops or wedges are unacceptable and should be limited to periods of actual need and then removed. 5. Open Flames Candles and similar items with open flames are prohibited. The presence of these items is a serious concern in regard to potential sources of fire. 6. Entry or Egress Routes of entry and egress should be maintained in an unobstructed fashion to ensure access by fire or other emergency response personnel and safe exit for occupants. Guidelines for corridor storage area: a. No permanent corridor storage is permitted in patient care areas. b. Storage in non-patient care areas should be limited to carts and materials contained in metal cabinets or files which are self-closing, attached to the wall, and fitted with a sloped top or soffit. c. Cabinets, files, or carts should not project beyond the face of structural pillars or obstruct EXIT or other safety-related equipment or signage. d. Cabinets, files, or carts should not be placed closer than 18 inches in public areas from door openings or within 36 inches of emergency equipment or pillars to which emergency equipment is attached. 7. Fire Alarm and Suppression Systems NSS is equipped with smoke detection and automatic sprinkler systems which are designed to signal, suppress, or extinguish fires in an initial stage. Alarms indicating the presence of smoke are electronically monitored. 8. The fire department is notified via annunciator panel and/or telephone. Emergency phone numbers are posted by phones in the front office/check-in area. Fire related equipment will be evaluated at least annually by contracted fire service to ensure they are functioning properly.

Develop an awareness of the Patient Safety Plan; iii. Develop knowledge and skills related to the analysis of patient safety events; iv. Prioritize and effect patient safety improvements; v. Determine if corrective actions and improv ements are effective; and vi. Report to the Governing Body at least quarterly. Responsibilities: All personnel will participate in the patient safety program. All personne l are responsible for reporting patient occurrences and potential occurrences. Patient Safety will be under the direction of the Quality Assurance Committee and will assist with the identification, coordination and implementation of patient safety initiatives. Non-Punitive Reporting Culture An effective Patient Safety Program cannot exist without optimal reporting of medical/health care errors and occurrences. Therefore, NSS strives for a non-punitive approach in its management of errors and occurrences. Personnel are required to report suspected and identified medical/health care errors, and should do so without the fear of reprisal in relationship to their employment. NSS supports the 21 concept that errors occur due to a breakdown in systems and processes, and focuses on improv ing systems and processes, rather than disciplining those responsible for errors and occurrences. A focus is placed on remedial actions to assist, rather than punish, staff members. Any identified instances of incompetence, negligence, and malfeasance that are discovered and ascertained during the evaluation of errors and occurrences are forwarded to Medical Director. Methodology: Identification of Medical/ Health Care Errors: The identification of medical/health care errors includes, but is not limited, to the following mechanisms: Incident reporting (which includes adverse drug reactions and emerg ency patient transfer), and Sentinel Event Reporting Options for reporting patient events are continuously being explored and will be included as they are approved. Response to medical/health care errors Upon identification of a medical/health care error, the staff immediately: i. Performs emergency healthcare interventions (if necess ary) to treat the patient's clinical condition. As appropriate to the occurrence, necessary healthcare interventions are performed to contain the risk to others. ii. Contacts the patient's providing physician and/or other physicians, as appropriate, to report the error and carryout any physician orders as necessary. iii. Reports the medical/health care error to the Director of Nursing and preserves any information related to the error (including physical information). Preservation of information includes documenting facts regarding the error on an occurrence report and in the medical record as appropriate. iv. Submit s the report of occurrence to the Safety Committee. v. Pa tients and, when appropriate, their families are informed about the outcomes of care, this includes unanticipated adverse outcomes- a result that differs significantly, and adversely, from what was anticipated from a treatment or procedure. Classification of Medical/Health Care Errors NSS defines medical/health care errors as defined by State regulation: 22 NRS 439.830 defines a sentinel event as: \"... an unexpected occurrence involving facility-acquired infection, death or serious physical or psychological injury or the risk thereof, including, without limitation, any process variation for which a recurrence would carry a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. The term includes loss of limb or function.\" It includes physical or mental damage that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual in the short term, which may becom e a disability if extended long term. Further, injury includes a substantial change in the patient's long-term risk status such that care or monitoring, based on accepted national standards, is required that was not required before the event. Serious defined in NQF Appendix B Glossary \"describes an event that can result in death, loss of a body part, disability, loss of bodily function, or require major intervention for correction (e.g., higher level of care, surgery) (NQF, 2011: B-4).\" NRS 439.835 requires that medical facilities report sentinel events to the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH).

Carson City, Nevada. September 2013. Prioritization of Safety Improv ement Activities: In a continuing effort to prevent errors and improv e patient safety, NSS 's Patient Safety Program utilizes internal and external informational resources, to identify potential improv ements in patient safety. Patient complaints, occurrence reporting, State and Federal recommendations, and current literature including the National Quality Forum (NQF) compilat ion of Best Patient Safety Practices. Patient Education and Patient Responsibilities: Staff educates patients and their families about their respective roles in helping to facilitate the safe delivery of care. Patients are given information of their rights and responsibilities upon admission Staff Education: Staff receives education and training during their initial orientation process and on a continuing basis. The education includes, but is not limited to; the need and process of reportin g 27 medical/health care errors, and the identification and disclosure of potential risks of healthcare errors Patient Safety Assessment: The Patient Safety Program includes at a minimum, an annual assessment of patients, their families, and staff (including medical staff) opinions, needs and perceptions of risks to patients, and request suggestions for improving patient safety. Governing Body The Governing Body is responsible and accountable for the approval of the Patient Safety Plan and the oversight of the Patient Safety Program. The Governing Body supports the appropriation of the resources necessary to address identified patient safety issues. NSS's progress with Patient Safety initiatives is evaluated and actions are planned based on the conclusions and recommend ations forwarded to it by the Quality Assurance Committee. Quality Assurance Committee The Quality Assurance Committee is charged with developing and monitoring the Patient Safety Program. The Quality Assurance Committee is knowledgeable of ongoing safety activities, and promotes new initiatives when necessary. Under the Patient Safety Program, the Quality Assurance Committee is responsible for: Enhancing NSS commitment to patient safety Facilitating and coordinating patient safety activities. SUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY POLICY NUMBER: 7.2.9 Purpose: To identify and eliminate potential safety hazards, thereby reducing risk to patients, perso nnel, and visitors. Policy: Patient safety refers to a systematic program to minimize preventable physical injuries, accidents, and undue psychological stress during the visit. The nursing practice for safety standards is a follows: 1. The procedure nurse always identifies the patient using two patient identifiers. 2. Staff shall use only accept able abbreviations for medication orders. 28 3. Patients are on beds which are at the lowest level, with the side rails up at all times when unattended or until discharge criteria is met. 4. All equipment and appliances must be set up and used according to the recommendations and instructions of the manufacturer. All new electrical equipment must be inspected prior to use and every year thereafter, by a CME. 5. Vendor representatives are not used as the sole source for clinical education. 6. Flammable solutions (i.e. alcohol) are not to be utilized when electrocautery is in progre ss. 7. All Biohazardous wastes, including glass, are placed in the special collection container marked \"Biohazardous Waste\" and disposed of by a contracted service provider. 8. Under normal conditions, extension cords shall not be used. Temporary use of extension cords may be permitted under specified conditions and with proper approval. Use of adaptors within the Center is prohibited. SUBJECT: OXYGEN ENRICHED ATMOSPHERE (OEA) POLICY NUMBER: 7.2.10 General Information: Nitrous oxide and oxygen can cause an oxygen-enriched atmosphere. An OEA makes fires start easier. In an OEA fires burn much faster. Even flame-resistant materials burn vigorously in an OEA. An OEA makes fires difficult to extinguish. An OEA usually occurs in confined areas, such as under drapes. Prevention: 1. Fire Prevention practices are the most important tools in stopping a fire from starting. The following represent safety tips when working in oxygen enriched atmosphere. Be careful with chemicals and aerosols that contain flammable ingredients. Keep control of high-energy devices that could ignite fires. 2. A fire in an OEA will spread quickly. All person nel need to be aware of fire fighting practices. If a fire occurs, R.A.C.E. protocol, which is outlined in the Fire Safety Management Plan, shall be adhered to, when managing a fire. SUBJECT: PORTABLE HEATERS POLICY NUMBER: 7.2.11 Purpose: Portable heaters pose a fire and electrical threat to patients and staff. Policy: Portable heaters are strictly prohibited. No portable external heating sources are allowed in NSS. 29 SUBJECT: CONTAMINATED PATIENTS POLICY NUMBER: 7.2.12 Purpose: To protect staff and patients from Nosocomial infections. Policy: 1. NSS will not admit nor perform procedures on the following patients: Active TB or suspected TB. Neutropenic patients. Patients requiring isolation. Patients suffering from biological, chemical, radioactive diseases that are active and may pose a threat to staff and other patients in the facility. SUBJECT: CHEMICAL SPILLS: POLICY NUMBER: 7.2.13 Purpose: To establish a policy for the effective response to spills and releases of hazardous chemicals and hazardous wastes, this will minimize the threat to human health and the environm ent. Policy: NSS is committed to taking all reasonable and necessary steps to protect human health and the environment in the event of spills and releases of hazardous chemicals. Of paramount importance are the health and safety of employees, patients, and visitors. Due regard is also given to protection of the environment, natural resources, and property. Definitions: Hazardous Chemical: any chemical product, substance, solution, or mixture that is labeled or identified as hazardous to humans and/or the environment. These include, but are not limited to, all products and dilutions listed as hazardous on the product's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or label, mixtures that contain greater than or equal to 1% by weight of a known hazardous chemical and other known hazardous chemicals. Hazardous Waste: any chemical hazardous waste as so defined in the federal Title 40 Chapter 1 Subchapter 1 Solid Waste Regulations. These include heavy metals, strong acids and alkalis, solvents and reactives and include chemicals which are the byproducts of procedures or tests, expired chemicals, 30 chemicals for which there is not useful purpose or intent, and certain materials and used reagents intended for reuse or recycling (i.e. - solvents), among others Procedure: 1. Hazardous Chemical List A current list of the hazardous chemical products that are present, or in use, is available to all staff on the MSDS. It contains information on spill response and clean-up information. 2. General Spill Response Procedures Where practical, employees in the immediate spill area will respond appropriately, contain and/or clean-up a spill, and arrange for proper disposal of the materials. Established protocols or procedures specified in product literature and/or MSDS will be followed. 3. First Aid Personal safety is the highest priority in any hazardous materials incident. The first action to be taken is to provide first aid to all who need it. In the event that someone is exposed in a spill incident: a. Remove all contaminated clothing. b. For splashes to the eye, flush the eye(s) with copious amounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes. c. For splashes to the body, flush the area thoroughly with running water or a chemical safety shower for a minimum of 15 minutes. d. Immediately report all employee hazardous chemical exposures to the Director of Nursing. e. Report all patient exposures to the patient's physician immediately. 4. Chemical Spills a. Identify the spilled material. b. Move personnel to a safe distance to prevent unnecess ary exposure to the hazardous material. c. Isolate the area of the spill to a safe distance. d. Notify your supervisor or their designee. e. Contain the spilled material to prevent it from spreading to clean areas, floor and sink drains, as well as other hazardous materials, especially incompatible substances. 31 f. Absorb the materials with a compatible absorbent such as paper towels, pads, dikes, booms, pillows or granu lar absorbents. Treat acids and caustics with the corresponding neutralizer, if appropriate. g. Using the appropriate personal protective equipment, pick up the absorbent and spilled materials and place it in a poly bag or similar appropriate container. h. Place broken glass in a sharps container. i. Place non-hazardous waste in the trash. Seal the container to minimize odors and vapors, if this is of concern. j. Place hazardous waste in a compatible leak-proof container and mark the container with: i. the words \"Hazardous Waste\". ii. the contents (i.e. - \"mercury spill clean-up\"). iii. the date. k. Thoroughly clean and decontaminate the area of the spill before allowing persons back into the site. l. Arrange for pick-up of the waste from the spill clean-up or place it in storage, as necessary. m. Complete a Chemical Spill Response Report and forward to the Director of Nursing. n. Restock all spill response supplies and personal protective equipment as needed. For spills and leaks that involve fire or explosion, the fire department will be notified immediately. Employees may attempt to extinguish a small fire if they have been trained in the use of portable fire extinguishers. 5. Releases which Threaten the Sanitary Sewer, Soil, or Washes a. All necess ary precaution should be taken to assure that hazardous chemical and hazardous waste spills do not spill on the ground or enter the sanitary sewer or washes. Backflow Prevention shall inspect the backflow prevention mechanism at least annually. b. In the event that a spill threatens to enter a sewer drain, the drain should be plugged or blocked with a dike. Similarly, the path leading to a wash or soil should have a dike to prevent spilled material from flowing onto the ground or entering the wash. Backflow Prevention will be notified immediately. In the event that material is spilled on the ground: a. Contain the spill to as small of an area as possible. b. Immediately report the spill to the Director of Nursing. 32 Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS): Distributors are required to provide a current MSDS for each hazardous chemical shipped. This MSDS need only be sent with the initial shipment, unless changes are made. 1. Upon receipt of all MSDS's, the Director of Nursing (or designee) should ensure that all required information is included on the document: a. Product name. b. Chemical name and synonym(s). c. Name, address, and telephone numb er of manufacturer/supplier. d. Physical data such as boiling point, appearance, odor. e. Fire and explosion hazard information data. f. Reactivity data. g. Health hazard information/exposure limits. h. Primary route(s) of entry. i. First aid information. j. Spill or leak procedures. k. Personal protective equipment to be used. l. Storage and handling information. m. Date of preparation. 2. All employees will have ready access to MSDS at all times. 3.

PROCEDURE : A. The ESU, dispersive electrode and active electrode shall be used according to the manufacturer's written instruction. B. Perioperative personnel will be instructed in the proper operation, care and handling of the ESU during their orientation period. Return demonstration after instruction must be documented for the perioperative employee. C. The ESU must be inspected before each use and checked at least annually by the biomedical service. D. Damaged or malfunctioning ESUs must be removed immediately and reported to the management. E. The ESU shall be assigned an identification number. The identification/serial number of the ESU is to be documented on the OR record. F. To prevent injury, patients will be instructed to remove as much jewelry as possible before their surgical procedure. G. The ESU shall be used in a manner that reduces the potential for injuries. 1. Following use, the ESU shall be turned off and t he unit and all its reusable parts cleaned according to the manufacturers written instructions. The surface of the ESU shall not be saturated with or have fluids poured over it. 2. The ESU shall not be used in the presence of flammable agents (e.g., alcohol, tincture- based fluids) 3. Safety features (e.g., lights, activation sound indicator) shall be present and tested before each ESU use. 4. Power settings shall be confirmed verbally between the operator and the user before activation and determined in conjunction with the manufacturers written recommendations and the patients' size. The ESU shall be operated at the lowest effective power setting to achieve the desired effect for coagulation and cutting. Personnel shall check the entire ESU circuit if the operator requests a continual increase in power because of ineffectual usage results. 5. The ESU shall be protected from spills. Fluids shall not be placed on top of the ESU. H. The ESU active electrode shall be used in a manner that minimizes the potent ial for injuries. 1. The active electrode shall be connected directly into a labeled, stress -resistant receptacle of the ESU. If an adapter is used, it shall be one that is approved by the manufacturer and does not compromise the generator's safety features . Las Vegas Regional Surgery Center / Safety / Approved January 3, 2014 3 2. The active electrode shall be inspected for damage, including impaired insulation, at the operative field before use. 3. The active electrode shall be placed in a clean, dry, well -insulated safety holster when it is not in use. 4. The active electr ode shall be disconnected from the ESU and replaced if it drops below the sterile field. 5. The active electrode shall have a tip that is secure and easy to clean. I. The dispersive electrode shall be used in a manner that minimized the potential for injuries. 1. The patient's skin integrity shall be evaluated and documented before and after ESU use. 2. The dispersive electrode shall not be placed over bony prominences, scar tissue, skin over an implanted metal prosthesis, hairy surfaces, or areas distal to tourniquets and pressure points. 3. The dispersive electrode shall be the appropriate size for a patient (i.e., neonate, infant, pediatric, adult) and never be cut to reduce its size. 4. After positioning the patient, the dispersive electrode shall be placed on a clean, dry skin surface over a large, well -perfused muscle mass and as close to the operative site as possible. 5. Patients' jewelry shall be removed. 6. Excessive hair shall be removed before applying the dispersive electrode. 7. The dispersive electrode shall connect directly into a labeled, stress -resistant receptacle of the ESU. If an adapter is used, it shall be approved by the manufacturer and not compromise the ESU generator's safety features. 8. The dispersive electrode shall maintain unif orm body contact to avoid tenting, gaping, and moisture that interferes with complete adhesion with the patient's skin. 9. The dispersive electrode shall be removed carefully to avoid denuding the surface of the skin. 10. The dispersive electrode and its c onnection to the ESU shall be checked if any tension is applied to the dispersive electrode cord or if the surgical team repositions the patient. J. Bipolar active electrodes function differently than monopolar active electrodes and shall be used according to the manufacturers written instruction. 1. In bipolar electrosurgery, a forceps is used for the coagulation of body tissue. One side of the bipolar forceps is the active electrode, and the other side is the return or ground electrode. 2. A dispersive electrode is not needed because current flows between the two tips of the bipolar forceps rather than through the patient. K. During laparoscopic surgery, the ESU shall be used in a manner that minimizes the likelihood of capacitive coupling injuries. Reference AO RN Standards, Recommended Practices and Guidelines (1999, 2000) Las Vegas Regional Surgery Center / Safety / Approved January 3, 2014 4 1 Use of the ESU with an operating laparoscope requires personnel to: \u00b7 Examine all electrodes for impaired insulation before use, \u00b7 Ensure proper connection of equipment, \u00b7 Ensure that t he active electrode is not activated until it is in close proximity to the tissue, \u00b7 Use the low -voltage cutting wave form setting whenever possible, \u00b7 Avoid open- circuit activation of the active electrode, \u00b7 Use the lowest power setting that achieves the desired result, and \u00b7 Use all metal or all plastic cannulas and not a hybrid cannula system (i.e., a combination of plastic and metal cannulas). L. If patient or personnel injuries or equipment failures occur, the ESU and the active and dispersive electrodes shall be handled in accordance with the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990. M. Personnel shall take special precautions when using the ESU with patients who have pacemakers and/or automatic defibrillators. 1. Patients with pacemakers shall have continuous E CG monitoring during ESU use. 2. Patients with an automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (AICD) shall: Have the AICD device deactivated before the ESU is activated Have a defibrillator immediately available, and Have continuous ECG monitoring. N. Exposure to smoke plume generated during electrosurgery shall be reduced.

Las Vegas Regional Surgery Center / Safety / Approved January 3, 2014 8 FALLS PREVENTION POLICY: The Center's patients are at greater risk for falls when they are given anesthesia. Therefore, all patients are considered a fall risk and will be assessed to minimize their risk of falling. The Center's staff will work to actively reduce the risk of falls across the continuum of care by ensuring a safe physical environment and appropriate identification of fall risk patients by utilizing the Morse Falls Risk Assessment. PROCEDURE: Standard Fall Risk Interventions: a. Orient patient/family to environment and routines. b. Place call light within reach and remind patients to call for assist ance. c. Ensure that patient bed is in low position and the brake is on. d. Place patient's necessary items within reach. e. Provide non- skid footwear for patient as needed. f. Minimize environmental trip/slips hazards. g. Round frequently (approximately every hour) and assess for safety and comfort. Reporting Patient Falls: Patient falls must be reported through the standard incident reporting process as patient falls are identified as an Incident. Las Vegas Regional Surgery Center / Safety / Approved January 3, 2014 9 FIRE IN THE OPERATING ROOM GENERAL INFORMATION Because of the presence of oxygen in the operating room, the potential for a dangerous fire is constantly present. A fire may be started by a spark from a cautery, from a suddenly malfunctioning piece of equipment or another source. The presence of oxygen means that this spark may be instantly amplified to a fir e which will endanger the patient, surgeon and all medical staff. POLICY 1. All medical staff shall be aware of and trained in the dangers of operating room fires and how to reduce the potential of operating room fires. 2. Physicians shall be advised of the danger of operating room fires and aware of ways to reduce the potential of operating room fires. 3. Precautions shall be taken for every case, every day to reduce the potential of operating room fires. 4. Inservices shall be held to educate Medical staff on the preventive measures used to reduce the risk of oxygen-aided fires in the operating room. 5. As part of the orientation program, the Clinical Supervisor and/or the Medical Director shall educate new employees in the dangers of operating room fires and inform them of ways to reduce the risk of these oxygen-aided fires. 6. Because of the constantly changing and advancing field of operating room instrumentation and because of the importance of this issue, Inservices for the medical staff shall be held at regular intervals (at least annually) to re-educate staff on the constant danger of these fires, ways to reduce the risk and ways of fires occurring and how to recognize potential causes PROCEDURE During head and neck procedures particular attention must be given to prepping, draping and positioning the patient, as patients with their heads draped are more susceptible to fire because supplemental oxygen can accumulate under the drapes. To decrease the risk of fire, the prep solution must be given adequate time to dry (3 minutes) - especially if there is alcohol in the solution. Draping and positioning the patient should be performed in a manner that does not allow pooling of oxygen under the drapes. Every effort should be made to use no more oxygen than is necessary to maintain adequate oxygen levels. If possible, provide room air or less than or equal to 30% oxygen, depending on patient needs. Oxygen can also be combined with air to decrease the risk of fire. If facial hair is exposed, coat the hair with a water -soluble surgical lubricating jelly to make it nonflammable. Additionally, moisten sponges, gauze and pledgets (and their strings) to render them ignition resistant. This is also true for chest procedures, where oxygen may pool in the open body cavity. Las Vegas Regional Surgery Center / Safety / Approved January 3, 2014 10 During all procedures, as a proactive safety measure, sterile water or saline must be on the back table prior to ESU, argon beam coagulator (ABC) or lasers being used. Additional safety measures that should be taken when performing electrosurgery, electrocautery or laser surgery are as follows: Stop supplemental O2 at least one minute before and during use of the unit, if possible. (Surgical team communication is essential.) Activate the unit only when the active tip is in view, especially if looking through a microscope Deactivate the unit before the tip leaves the surgical site Place electrosurgical electrodes in a holster or another location off the patient when not in active use (i.e., when not needed within the next few moments) Place lasers in standby mode when not in active use Do not place rubber catheter sleeves over electrosurgical electrodes Fiberoptic Light Sources Fiberoptic light sources can start fires. Complete all cable connections before activating the source. Place the light source in standby mode, or turn the unit off when disconnecting cables. Never leave a light cord that is still luminating on top of the patient drapes. Although surgical drapes are fire retar dant, they are still flammable. In Case of a Fire in operative or procedural areas the following steps should be taken in order initiate RACE : 1. Announce the fire. 2. Remove the burning material from contacting the patient (drapes, ETT, etc.) 3. Have the anesthesiologist stop the flow of gases (i.e., O2, N2O, Desflurane, etc.) 4. Immediately smother/put out the fire (when safe to do so). Attempt to extinguish with water or saline aim at the base of the fire. To smother a fire hold a towel between fire and the patient s airway , drop one end of the towel toward the patients head, drop the other end of towel over the fire, sweep your hand over the towel and raise the towel and keep your body away from the fire. DO NOT PAT the fire. Obtain fire extinguisher as last response and Extinguish on floor. 5. Set off the fire alarm (Code Red) 6. Evacuate the patient, if necessary 7. Save any material/devices for follow -up investigation Fighting Fires Involving an Endotracheal Tube 1. Announce the fire. 2. Collaborate and assist the anesthesia professional with: disconnecting and removing the breathing circuit turning off the flow of oxygen pouring saline or water into the airway removing the endotracheal tube and any segments of the burned tube examining the airway re-establishing the airway Las Vegas Regional Surgery Center / Safety / Approved January 3, 2014 11 Fighting Fires On or In Equipment 1. Communicate the presence of the fire to team members . 2. Disconnect equipment from its electrical source. 3. Shut off electricity to the piece of equipment at the electrical panel . 4. Shut off gases to equipment, if applicable. 5. Assess fire size and determine if equipment can be removed safely or if evacuation is needed. 6. Extinguish fire with extinguisher, if appropriate 7. Activate alarms, if necessary . 8. Notify the appropriate personnel .

The RSO's specific duties shall include: Establishing and overseeing operating and ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) procedures. Ensuring that radiation operations are conducted safely, and: Assuming control and authority to institute corrective actions. The patient will be protected from unnecessary radiation exposure. Measures taken to protect patients during the procedure from the risks of direct and indirect radiation exposure will be documented on the health care record. Las Vegas Regional Surgery Center / Safety / Approved January 3, 2014 16 Radiation Safety continued Procedure: Protecting the Patient from Unnecessary Exposur e Care will be taken to keep extraneous patient body parts out of the radiation beam to prevent injury. Before any radiological exposure, female patients of childbearing age will be questioned about the possibility of pregnancy. o If the possibility of preg nancy exists, the surgeon will be notified to determine the advisability of continuing or postponing the procedure. Signs will be posted throughout the Center. Lead shielding will be placed between the patient and the source of radiation whenever possible to reduce unintended radiologic exposure. Lead shielding will not be in the beam during procedures using fluoroscopy (eg, hand surgery). Lead shielding will be used, when possible, to protect the patient's ovaries or testes during x-ray studies, including those performed on the hips and upper legs. Lead shielding will be used, when possible, to protect the patient's thyroid during x -ray studies of the upper extremities, trunk, and head. Minimizing Occupational Exposure The fluoroscopy equipment shall be l ocated in a restricted area. The restricted area is designated by \"Caution X -Ray\" signs. Only authorized personnel are allowed in the room during fluoroscopy examination. Warning signs must be posted to alert health care personnel to potential radiation hazards at entrances to ORs and other procedure rooms where radiological equipment is in use. Health care personnel will limit the amount of time spent in close proximity to the radiation source when exposure to radiation is possible. The radiation equipment operator must notify personnel present in the treatment room before activating the equipment. During fluoroscopic procedures, health care personnel will keep the patient as close as possible to the image intensifier side of the fluoroscopic unit and away from the tube side of the unit. Health care personnel involved in fluoroscopic procedures will stand on the image intensifier side of the fluoroscopic unit, whenever possible, to reduce exposure (ie, standing on the same s ide as the image intensifier experience decreases radiation intensity). Minimize fluoroscopy exposure time to a minimal and use pulse exposure whenever necessary or possible adhering to the principles of ALARA. Health care personnel assisting with radiolog ical procedures will not hold the patient manually for a radiographic study because of the risk of direct beam exposure. Shielding will be available at all times when radiation is being delivered to the health care personnel who may be potentially exposed. The following shielding will be available: o aprons, thyroid shields, Health care personnel who may have to stand with their backs to the radiation beam will wear wrap- around aprons to decrease the risk of exposure. Health care personnel near the radiation beam (eg, oblique imaging with the x -ray tube in close proximity to the lower body of the operator) will wear aprons of sufficient length to shield the upper legs and protect the long bones and bone marrow from increased doses of radiation. Las Vegas Regional Surgery Center / Safety / Approved January 3, 2014 17 Radiation Saf ety continued Thyroid shields will be worn by health care personnel to protect the thyroid whenever the likelihood of the procedure (eg, orthopedic spinal fixation procedures) places them at higher risk because of increased exposure. Female health care personnel will protect their breasts from radiation exposure by using aprons that cover the area completely. Health care personnel will keep all body parts out of the direct x -ray beam. Pregnant Health Care Personnel Health care personnel will not be required to disclose pregnancy, even if their condition is obvious; however, personnel are strongly encouraged to declare this condition. Occupational dose to the embryo or fetus of an occupationally exposed health care worker who has declared her pregnancy must not exceed 0.5 rem during the entire gestational period. Occupational dose will be uniform over time and not all at once (ie, at one point in the gestational period). Deep- dose equivalent of the declared pregnant health care worker must be used as the dose to the embryo or fetus. Maternity aprons must be easily identifiable and available to pregnant health care personnel. Pregnant health care personnel must wear maternity aprons to decrease the amount of radiation to the embry o or fetus. Shielding Devices Before use, newly purchased leaded devices will be tested for ant cracks and for shielding properties to ensure no damage (eg, cracks or holes) occurred during transit. Leaded aprons and thyroid shields will be stored flat or hung vertically and will not be folded. Protective devices will be cleaned with an EPA -registered disinfectant after every use. Radiation Monitors Health care personnel who are involved routinely in fluoroscopic procedures will wear at least one radiation dosimeter badge. Health care personnel who are pregnant will wear radiation dosimeters at the waist and readings will be performed monthly. Documentation Any x- ray procedure performed in the operating room must be documented in the fluoroscopy log. The R SO will provide documentation of records such as Notice to Employees posting and Notice of Registration. An incident report will be completed for any procedure in which radiological exposure has occurred and wherein the procedures and interventions in this policy were not followed. Documentation of the readings of the dosimeters will be provided on a quarterly basis and maintained by the RSO. Records of the provisions of the radiation safety program (including personnel radiation exposure monitoring recor ds) will be maintained at this facility until the registration is terminated. Records of audits and other reviews of program content and implementation will be maintained at the facility for three years after the record was created. These procedures have been developed to ensure safe radiological working conditions. Everyone must adhere to these procedures. In- services regarding Radiation Safety will be conducted on an annual basis. The in- service will be provided by the Radiation Safety Officer.

Patient Safety Plan 2016 1 Barton Health 2016 Patient Safety Plan Purpose Barton Health is committed to continuously improving patient safety and reducing health care errors. This Patient Safety Plan ensures that Barton Health implements and maintains a patient safety program in accordance with The Joint Commission standards, guidelines from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS), Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005, and other regulatory agencies. Introduction The Patient Safety Plan supports and promotes the mission, vision, values, and strategic plan of Barton Health. This Plan implements continuous integration and coordination of patient safety activities for all medical staff, clinical departments, support service departments and service lines including trauma at Barton Health. A culture of safety inherently implies the continued attention, refinement and progression of the patient safety plan and program. Barton Health 's patient safety goal is to foster an environment and culture where patients, families, staff and leaders within the organization identify and manage actual and potential risks to patient safety thereby resulting in zero harm. All patients and staff are strongly encouraged and supported with multiple avenues/programs to speak up when safety concerns are identified. As an organization, Barton Health has the obligation to listen and respond to these concerns. The Patient Safety Plan is designed to reduce patient safety errors and improve patient care delivery processes by utilizing a systematic, coordinated and continuous approach to the improvement of patient safety. This approach centers on the establishment of mechanisms that support effective responses to actual occurrences; ongoing proactive reductions in health related errors including near miss and good catch events; and integration of patient safety priorities in the design and redesign of all relevant organizational processes, functions, and services. Patient safety is emphasized in areas such as patient's rights, patient and family education, continuity of care, risk reduction, and managing performance improvement. Each employee performs a critical role in patient safety and thus, Barton Health's journey to becoming a high reliability organization . All Barton Health team members are focused on providing consistently exceptional care through an environment that supports team work, collaboration and respect for other people, regardless of their position in the organization. Leaders demonstrate their commitment to quality and safety while setting expectations for those who work in the organization. Leadership evaluates the culture of safety on a regular basis. The Chief Medical Officer and Patient Safety Officer (PSO), provide oversight to the integrated patient safety program. These individuals ensure alignment of patient safety activities, compliance with regulations, and provide opportunities for all Barton Health team members to be educated and involved in patient safety initiatives. The Patient Safety Officer has the authority to intervene in any clinical or non-clinical activity which poses an actual or potential negative outcome to a patient's well being . The PSO involve s Patient Safety Plan 2016 2 leadership in the creation, initiation and evaluation of corrective action measures for event resolution . The Governing Body, Board Quality Committee , and Patient Safety Committee , described below, are committed to patient safety . These bodies shall assur e an environment that encourages error identification, remediation, non -punitive reporting , and prevention through education, system redesign , or process improvement for any potential or actual adverse event. In accordance with T he Joint Commission' s Accreditation Participation Requirements , APR.09.02.01 , this plan implies Barton Health shall: Educate its staff, medical staff, and other individuals who provide care, treatment, and services that concerns about the safety or quality of care provided in the organization may be reported to The Joint Commission. Inform its staff and medical staff that Barton Health will take no disciplinary or punitive action because an employee, physician, or other individual who provides care, treatment, and services re ports safety or quality of care concerns to The Joint Commission. Take no disciplinary or punitive action against employees, physicians, or other individuals who provide care, treatment, and services when they report safety or quality of care concerns to The Joint Commission. Any employee or medical staff member may contact The Joint Commission if they have a safety or quality of care concern that is not being addressed by Barton Health . All employees or medical staff members are strongly encouraged to bring any safety or quality of care concerns to the Chie f Medical Officer, Patient Safety Officer, Director of Risk Management, or Director of Quality without fear of punitive or disciplinary action. In addition, patients are provided information in the pa tient handbook regarding their right to contact and report a complaint through The Joint Commission. Scope of the Patient Safety Plan The Joint Commission , CDP H, NRS, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) guidelines and other regulatory agenci es provide the defining framework for patient safety events . The Patient Safety Officer is informed of safety event information and hazardous conditions from team members , volunteers, and medical staff practitioners across the organization through comp letion of event reports as collected by the Risk Management Department and verbal or written communication. This information includes actual or potential (near miss /good catch ) occurrences involving inpatients, outpatients, volunteers, employees , physician s, allied healthcare providers and visitors. Risk Assessment Proactive assessment of high risk activities and hazardous conditions are identified through event reporting, failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA ), data collection , audits (tracers) , and utilization. In addition, risk reduction strategies are built into the continual process improvement system. Such strategies are obtained from available information regarding sentinel events known to occur in health care organizations that provide similar car e and services a s well as knowledge based information including content from state patient safety organizations as well as other state, national, and international professional organizations. Patient Safety Plan 2016 3 2015 Priority Review , Barton Heal th continue d to prioritize NPSG.06.01.01 focusing on alarm system safety in 2015. An intense alarm review was completed with biomedical equipment default parameters adjusted after consultation with medical and clinical staff and consideration of patient risk, alarm necessity, and best practices and guidelines . A clinical alarm management policy was developed. Barton Health continued to ensure the transition to the new ISO (International Organization for Standardization) connector standards was an organizational high priority in accorda nce with California AB 1867 and Joint Commission Sentinel Event Alert 53. This priority will continue into 2016 as new connectors become available from manufacturers as well as misconnecting intravenous, enteral feeding and epidural lines per California Health and Safety Code 1279.7.3. . High Priorities for 201 6 In 2016, sepsis will remain Barton's Failure Mode and Effec t Analysis (FMEA ). Work on this FMEA will finish up in the first half of the year. Monitoring of mental health and pediatric patient issues will be ongoing during the year. Attention will be directed toward system needs as well as staff education and tra ining to ensure safe patient care. Efforts will also focus on increasing patient safety presence in all Barton Health physician practices and off-site clinical departments through increased site visits by the patient safety team. Event Prioritization Opportunities for improv ing patient safety issues are prioritized according to level of severity, frequency of the occurrence, potential for harm to the patient, employee or visitor involvement , and potential for liability. Ongoing review of information is performed to direct administrative and medical staffs' attention to areas of clinical care representing significant sources of actual or potential risk. Types of medical / heal th care errors include , but are not limited to : Adverse Event : Per The Joint Com mission, an adverse event is a patient safety event that resulted in harm to a patient. It is also defined as an unexpected occurrence meeting any of the Adverse Event criteria as designated by CDPH. Error: An unintended omission or commission of an act, or an act that does not achieve its intended outcome . Near Miss /Good Catch /Close Call : Any patient safety event that did not reach the patient ... No-Harm Event - a patient safety event that reaches the patient but does not cause harm. Hazardous Condition : Any set of circumstances, exclusive of the disease or condition for which the patient is being treated, which significantly increases the likelihood of a n adverse event . Sentinel Event: A patient safety event (not primarily related to the natural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition) that reaches a patient and results in death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm (Refer to Sentinel Event section below) and is Patient Safety Plan 2016 4 reported to The Joint Commission. For Lake Tahoe Surgery Center, located in Nevada, a sentinel event is defined by the National Quality Forum. (Refer to Appendix A) Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI): A localized or systemic condition resulting from an adverse reaction to the presence of an infec tious agents(s) or its toxin(s) as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) in addition to monthly submission of all surgical site infections associated with different procedures performed at Barton Health . Potential HAIs are reviewed by the HAI Review Committee. Confirmed HAIs are reported to the Patient Safety Committee. HAIs are also reported to Quality Council , Interdisciplinary Collaborative Care Team, and Board Quality Committees. Any patient safety event, incident, or c ondition that could have resulted or did result in harm to a patient shall b e subject for review and further analysis. Event Reporting Identification and reporting of adverse events, including those that result from practitioner error are critical to Bar ton Health's efforts to continuously improve patient safety and reduce harm. To support and encourage this culture of safety, reporting of patient safety events or near misses is highly encouraged. Reporting of events is the responsibility of all employee s, volunteers, practitioners , patients, visitors and guests. Events can be reported though many modalities including electronic, verbal, and written communication. Electronic event reporting is available on all Barton Healthcare System computer terminals. An event is reported via the electronic event reporting system by the individual(s) involved with and most knowledgeable about the event. (Refer to Barton Health Organizational Event R eporting Policy. ) Events are reviewed on a daily basis. High severity e vents are reviewed immediately to ensure immediate action is taken as warranted. Regulatory Agency Reporting Barton Health inform s accrediting and licensing bodies when errors and events fall within that agency's reporting requirements . Team members involved in sentinel or adverse events have access to support and are included whenever possible in the root cause analysis process to ensure the potential for recurrence is minimized . Intensive assessment may be initiated when undesirable patterns or trends are identified or serious , adverse, or sentinel events occur . Sentinel Events reportable to The Joint Commission and Adverse Events reportable to CDPH are delineated below . (Refer to Appendix A for Nevada Sentinel Event reporting.) Sentinel Event Patient safety events are determined to fall into the category of a Sentinel Event as defined by The Joint Commission when any of the following occur: A sentinel event is a patient safety event (not primarily related to the natural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition) that reaches a patient and results in any of the following: Death Permanent harm Severe temporary harm* Patient Safety Plan 2016 5 Or The event is one of the following (even if the outcome was not death, or major permanent loss of function unrelated to the n atural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition): Suicide of any patient receiving care, treatment a nd services in a staffed around the clock care setting or within 72 hours of discharge including from the hospital's emergency department (ED ) Unanticipated death of a full -term infant Abduction of any patient receiving care, treatment, and services Discharge of an infant to the wrong family Any elopement (that is, unauthorized departure) of a patient from a staffed around -the- clock care settin g (including ED), leading to death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm to the patient Rape , assault (leading to death , permanent harm, or severe temporary harm ), or homicide of any patient receiving care, treatment, and services while on site at th e organization Rape, assault (leading to death , permanent harm, or severe temporary harm ), or homicide of a staff member, licensed independent practitioner, visitor or vendor while on site at the organization Hemolytic transfusion reaction involving admin istration of blood or blood products having major blood group incompatibilities (ABO, Rh, other blood groups) Invasive procedure, including surgery, on the wrong patient, at the wrong site, or that is the wrong (unintended) procedure Unintended retention o f a foreign object in a patient after an invasive procedure, including surgery Sever e neonatal hyperbilirubinemia ( bilirubin greater than 30 milligrams/deciliter) Prolonged fluoroscopy with cumulative dose greater than 1500 rads to a single field or any delivery of radiotherapy to the wrong body region or greater than 25% above the planned radiotherapy dose Fire, flame, or unanticipated smoke, heat, or flashes occurring during an episode of patient care Any intrapartum (related to the birth process) matern al death Severe maternal morbidity (not primarily related to the natural course of the patient 's illness or underlying condition ) when it reaches a patient and results in an y of the following: Permanent harm or severe temp orary harm *. *Severe temporary harm is critical, potentially life threatening harm lasting for a limited time with no permanent residual, but requires transfer to a higher level of care/monitoring for a prolonged period of time, tr ansfer to a higher level of care for a life -threatening condition, or additional major surgery, procedure, or treatment to resolve the condition. It is Barton Health's policy to report Sentinel Events to The Joint Commission within the required reporting t imeframe (Refer to Barton Health Sentinel Event Policy) . Patient Safety Plan 2016 6 Adverse Event Barton Health shall report an adverse event as define d within Health and Safety Code \u00a71279.1 (below) to CDPH no later than five calendar days after the event has been detected or, if th e event is an ongoing urgent or emergent threat to the welfare, health, or safety of patients, personnel, or visitors, no later than 24 hours after the adverse event has been detected.

Provider -Preventable Conditions Federal law requires Provider -Preventable Conditions (PPCs) that occur during treatment o f Medi -Cal and Medicaid patients be reported . These include both health care -acquired conditions (HCAC) and other provider -preventable conditions (OPPC). California HCACs and OPPCs are reported to the Department of Health Care Services within five working days. Nevada HCACs are reported through the Nevada sentinel event registry. HCACs are defined as: Air embolism Blood incompatibility Catheter -associated urinary tract infection (UTI) Patient Safety Plan 2016 8 Falls and trauma that result in fractures, dislocations, intracranial injuries, crushing injuries, burns and electric shock Foreign object retained after surgery Iatrogenic pneumothorax with venous catheterization Manifestations of -Secondary diabetes with hyperosmolarity Stage III and IV pressure ulcers Surgical site infection following: - Mediastinitis follo wing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) - Bariatric surgery, including laparoscopic gastric bypass, gastroenterostomy and laparoscopic gastric restrictive surgery - Orthopedic procedures for spine, neck, shoulder, and elbow - Cardiac implantable electroni c device (CIED) procedures Vascular catheter -associated infection -pediatric/obstetric (DVT)/ pulmonary embolism (PE) resulting from: -Total knee replacement - Hip replacement OPPCs are defined as: Wrong surgical or other invasive procedure performed on a patient Surgical or other invasive procedure performed on the wrong body part Surgical or other invasive procedure performed on the wrong patient Patient Safety Organization Reporting Barton Healthcare System is a member of the California Hospital Patient Safety Organization (CHPSO) , which serves as its Patient Safety Organization (PSO). Patient Safety Work Product is submitted to CHPSO in accordance with the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005. (Refe r to P atient Safety Evaluation System Policy for further details. ) Investigation: Root Cause Analysis and Process Improvements In any event when a n adverse/sentinel event or hazardous condition h as occurred, the issue is revisited and the status mitigated through a risk reduction strategy using the Root Cause Analysis (RCA ) process. Lesser events are managed through either an RCA or Process Improvement (PI). Reportable Adverse or Sentinel Events shall be subject to an immediate in-depth RCA . RCAs shall be convened by the Patient Safety Officer , Risk Manager, or Director of Quality and includes team members either directly or indirectly involved in the event. Members from uninvolved departments may be invited to provide additional information. During the RC A, events are deconstructed in an effort to identify the key causes that may have contributed to the event. The deconstruction process leads to action items designed to eliminate or control system hazards or vulnerabilities directly related to causal and contributory factor s. The Veterans Affairs National Center for Patient Safety Action Hierarchy is used to assure strong corrective action items are identified. To ensure consistency, The Joint Commission's Root Caus e Analysis and Action Plan template is utilized as a framework. Patient Safety Plan 2016 9 Process Improvement teams are formed when an issue effecting more then one service line is identified and a near miss may or may not be involved. There may be no adverse patient outcome in co nnection with the event, however, the potential for a patient event should the issue recur is likely. PIs may also result from discussions during RCAs where a system improvement process is identified as a result of a patient event. Team members convene and identify key factors involved in the process through deconstruction that may have contributed to the situation and create action items to mitigate the identified issues. RCA and PI workgroups construct action items and assign them to appropriate individu als for completion. Staff involvement is considered essential, since they are the team members on the front line with the most knowledge of the actual day -to-day workings of the processes. Individuals assigned action items are required to complete the tasks within a designated amount of time depending upon the breadth of the item. Action items may be forwarded to other appropriate bodies for further in -depth ev aluation, review, response, revision , or development of policies or procedures when applicable. Ac tion item progress and completion is reported to the Patient Safety Officer. As a learning organization utilizing Just Culture , Barton Health focuses on systems and processes, not individuals, during RCA or PI event review. Disclosure Full disclosure of serious medical errors, reportable events and any unanticipated outcome s are communicated to patients/families by the pr actitioner with the assistance of the Director of Risk Management, Patient Safety Officer, or Director of Quality as appropriate. (Refer to Barton Health Disclosure of Unanticipated Outcome Policy. ) Patient Safety Committee The Patient Safety Committee is a multidisciplinary team focused on review and discussion of patient events resulting in a near -miss or an untoward outcome as well as process improvements for the purposes of improving patient safety and the quality of care delivered to Barton Healthcare System's patients. The Patient Safety Committee is a standing committee of the Medical Staff and is comp rised of the Chief Medical Of ficer, Chief of Staff, Physician Director of the Emergency Department, Hospitalist Director, Trauma Medical Director, Nurse Director of the Emergency Department, Patient Safety Officer, Director of Pharmacy, Director of Intensive Care Unit, Director of Ris k Management, Vice President of Nursing and Director of Quality. Ad Hoc members are invited as appropriate . The Patient Safety Committee shall review and discuss codes , hospital deaths , Rapid Response Team activations (including near codes), HAIs, serious patient events, and reportable adverse and sentinel patient events. Adverse /sentinel patient events include unanticipated events that affect patient care or patient safety and encompass all service lines of care . The Committee promote s the application o f evidence -based methods in the resolution of patient safety events and reviews RCA and PI workgroup recommendations which ultimately minimize the recurrence of comparable patient events or near misses . Recommendations can be revised, added or deleted thro ugh this committee. Patient Safety Plan 2016 10 The Lake Tahoe Surgery Center Patient Safety Committee is a subcommittee of and reports to the Patient Safety Committee. Refer to Appendix A . Department Directors or designees are active participants who complete assigned action item s within an appropriate timeframe designated by the work group, P atient Safety Officer , Chief Medical Officer , or Patient Safety Committee . Directors are responsible for implementing action items and reporting back to the Patient Safety Committee and/or th e Patient Safety Officer with status updates and upon completion of assigned action items. Directors are responsible to ensure continued compliance exists with their direct reports and implemented process changes are sustained. Events and PIs shall be closed through the Patient Safety Committee when all assigned action items have been completed , any associated audits exhibit compliance, and a ll remaining concerns are addressed . The Patient Safety Officer or designee shall report p atient safety events and process improvements from the Patient Safety Committee to the Board Quality Committee . The Chief Medical Officer or designee shall report acute events and process improvements from the Patient Safety Committee to the Medical Executive Committee and Governing Board. Patient Safety Risk Reduction Several approaches are utilized at Barton Health to reduce the risk of a patient safety event. The Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goals , National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Patient Safety First, and California Hospital Patient Safety Organization (CHPSO) are some examples of utilized resources to prevent and reduce the likel ihood of serious patient safety events . Sentinel Event Alerts released through The Joint Commission are also analyzed for compliance. National Patient Safety Goals Compliance with The Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goals are monitored and evaluated on a continual basis through observational audits. D ata analys es of these audits shall be reported to and reviewed by Quality Council and Board Quality Committee on a biannual basis . Measure of success for compliance on each standard's requirement i s expected to be 90% (ninety percent) and above. Elements falling near or below 90% (ninety percent) are addressed by the appropriate Department Director. The Director shall formulate an action plan with the goal of improving the affected element score wit hin their department. Patient Safety observational audits ( tracers ) are conducted on a routine basis. Immediate training is provided to staff when non -compliance with policy elements is observed . (Refer to Patient Safety Observational Tracer Policy.) Sentinel Event Alerts Sentinel Event Alerts, published through The Joint Commission, are communicated through the Patient Safety Committee . Compliance status and opportunities for improvement are addressed through workgroups consisting of affec ted Department Directors, Executive Team Members and others as appropriate to formulate risk reduction strateg ies and follow up through an action plan. Action items within the action plan are assigned to individuals who are required to complete the tasks w ithin a designated amount of time depending upon the breadth of the item. Action items Patient Safety Plan 2016 11 may be forwarded to other appropriate bodies for further in -depth evaluation, review, response, revision, or development of policies or procedures when applicable. Actio n item progress and completion is reported to the Patient Safety Officer. Scientific Model Integration The patient safety program has been developed with scientific knowledge in a foundational aspect including concepts from: Shewhart cycle or Model for I mprovement (Plan, Do, Study , Act -PDSA ) Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) Re-engineering (Human factor re -engineering such as signage for High Alert Medications, Pop up alert in Pyxis medication dispensing system, Tall man lettering for look-alike sound alike drugs in medication usage process , etc.) Rapid Cycle Improvement (IHI Collaborative approach termed the 'Breakthrough Series', to bring about rapid cycle improvements. Fundamental to the collaborative approach is the acceptance of a model and es tablishment of infrastructure through which collaborating organizations can identify and prioritize aims for improvement and gain access to the methods, tools, materials etc.) Process Improvement such as Lean and Six Sigma concepts Evidence -based practice and clinical practice guidelines Educational Enhancement Activities The Patient Safety Plan provides the opportunity to reduce patient safety events and hazardous conditions through education, proper and effective orientation , and annual training. Barton Health's clinical orientation program emphasizes medical error reduction and specific job -related aspects of patient safety. Ongoing patient safety training for Barton Health team members including p ractitioners is offered through various teaching strategi es including, but not limited to, bulletin boards, online learning formats, skills labs, and didactic experiences . Program c ontent may include education specific to patient safety related events or advancements in patient safety practice. As appropriate, t his training incorporates methods of team training such as TeamSTEPPS by AHRQ to foster an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to the delivery of patient care and reinforces the need and mechanisms to report patient safety concerns . Patient Safety Evaluation Annually, patient safety activities shall be reviewed and presented to the Patient Safety and Board Quality Committee s. Patient Safety Plan Approval, Revision and Review The Patient Safety Committee shall review and approve this plan at least o nce a year, but more often as necessary , to evaluate and update the plan, and to incorporate advancements in patient safety practices . The Board Quality Committee shall review and a pprove this plan at least annually . Authority The authority to implement t he Pat ient Safety Plan rests with Barton Health's Governing Body, Board Quality Committee , Medical Executive Committee, and Patient Safety Committee .

The Patient Safety Officer or designee shall report the date, time, and provide a description of the sentinel event to the Divisi on within 13 days after the event. Notification may be done by a representative designated by the Patient Safety Officer, Director of Risk Management, or Director of Quality. In the case of a sentinel event, a root cause analysis (RCA) is completed by the Patient Safety Officer, Director of Risk Management or the Director of Quality. The RCA shall be conducted with the development and implementation of a plan to remedy the causes and, if identified, contributing factors to the event. The RCA is reported to the Lake Tahoe Surgery Center Patient Safety Committee, Patient Safety Committee, Board Quality and Governing Board. Patient Safety Plan 2016 Appendix A 18 RCA and PI workgroups construct action items and assign them to appropriate individuals for completion. Staff involvement is considered es sential, since they are the team members on the front line with the most knowledge of the actual day -to-day workings of the processes. Individuals assigned action items are required to complete the tasks within a designated amount of time depending upon th e breadth of the item. Action items may be forwarded to other appropriate bodies for further in -depth evaluation, review, response, revision, or development of policies or procedures when applicable. Action item progress and completion is reported to the Patient Safety Officer. As a learning organization, Barton Health focuses on systems and processes, not individuals, during RCA or PI event review. Patient Communication and Education Staff, in conjunction with the Lake Tahoe Surgery Center Patient Safet y Committee, will develop avenues to communicate and educate patients and family about general safety issues and patient care. Specific areas that may be addressed are: Measures utilized by the facility for preventing infections including facility -acquired infections Information on determining whether a patient had an infection upon admission to Lake Tahoe Surgery Center, risk factors for acquiring infections and determining whether an infection has been acquired Information on preventing facility -acquired infections Instructions for reporting facility -acquire infections including contact information for reporting to the Nevada Division of Public Health Patients involved in sentinel events shall be notified of the event within seven (7) days. Patients invol ved in facility related infections will be notified of such no later than five (5) days after confirmed diagnosis.

Great Basin Surgical Center SUBJECT: Patient Safety Improvement and Management Program: Patient Safety Plan Policy # CQIP.10 APPROVED: January 2015 \u00a9Copyright 2004 Nueterra Healthcare Management, L.L.C. Revised 6/2011 P age 1 of 11 I. Overview and Purpose Attention to maintaining and improving patient safety and well being is inherent in the facility's commitment to the relief of suffering and improvement in the quality of life to those in the community it serves. In committing ourselves to safeguarding individuals , Great Basin Surgical Center must fully understand the processes and systems that are utilized by the organization to deliver patient care. From this deeper understanding, Great Basin Surgical Center will be able to ana lyze, evaluate, develop, and implement changes that will continuously improve the way we deliver care to patients. T he results of these efforts will: demonstrate this facility's commitment to the community it serves; enable Great Basin Surgical Center and individuals who work and practice at this facility t o r espond appropriately to adverse events, proactively identify risk -reduction strategies, a nd p articipate in process and system redesign to reduce risk of patient harm; allow this facility to implement processes, technology, or systems that will reduce the risk of errors reaching patients and causing harm; promote greater medical staff and employee involvement in improving clinical care, which wil l r esult in improved employee and medical staff satisfact ion; translate into a more efficient and cost -effective model of care and Begin the healing process for those individuals suffering from medical accidents. The Great Basin Surgical Center 's leadership, medical staff, and employees must actively embrace an d support the patient safety improvement and management program in order to achieve the results outlined above. The purpose of the patient safety plan is to provide a framework for the implementation of various components of the patient safety program . II .P rinciples G reat Basin Surgical Center 's patient safety plan is based on the following principles. I mprovement in patient safety will not occur unless there is a commitment by the facility governing body and senior management and an overt, clearly defined, and ongoing effort on the part of the Facility leaders, physicians, managers, and employees to sustain the organization' s i nterest and focus on patient safety . The leadership staff will k eep the facility board of manager s ap prised of any adverse outcomes, safety problems, and efforts directed at improving patien t s afety . C ommunication about the importance of patient safety must be well conceived, repeated, a nd c onsistent across the entire organization. In its communication with physicians, employ ees, and patients, Great Basin Surgical Center will stress that safety problems are quality problems and that all persons must be involved in the patient safety reporting system, identifying deficiencie s i n current care processes, and in designing and exec uting solutions needed to create safer systems. All individual concerns and ideas about how to improve patient safety will be valued a nd r espected.Great Basin Surgical Center SUBJECT: Patient Safety Improvement and Management Program: Patient Safety Plan Policy # CQIP.10 APPROVED: January 2015 \u00a9Copyright 2004 Nueterra Healthcare Management, L.L.C. Revised 6/2011 P age 2 of 11 Responsibility and accountability for patient safety must be clearly articulated to physicians, managers, and employees . Great Basin Surgical Center will incorporate patient safety accountability into position descriptions, orientation, and ongoing education and training. F eedback about how the sharing of information and reporting of various types of events w as act ed upon and used to make improvements in the care delivery system is important. Great Basin Surgical Center wi ll provide feedback to those employees and health care provides who have reported or disclosed errors. This feedback may range from ackno wledgement that the report has been received to results of detailed root cause analyses. P unitive approaches toward individuals involved in various events pushes reporting a nd di sclosure underground, thereby preventing an opportunity for the organization to appropriately intervene to correct the underlying problems. This organization is committed to developing ways to reward rather than discourage reporting of errors or patient safety concerns and will celebrat e s uccesses at improving the reporting of pat ient safety concerns and errors and how suc h i nformation has been used to make improvements in facility processes, systems, and car e d elivery. A bundant evidence in human factors and cognitive psychology literature recognizes that most human errors are sym ptoms of underlying system failures, not personal failures. When huma n f ailures do occur, they are most often consequences of inevitable, \"built-in\" limitations of huma n c ognition or endurance. Individuals involved in incidents and serious events will no t be blamed for the occurrence or subjected to retribution. Rather, Great Basin Surgical Center will offe r s upport and counseling to individuals involved in an event with an unanticipated outcome a nd in volve these individuals in assisting the organization to learn from the event and devel op s trategies to avoid the possibility of having such an event occur again. At Great Basin Surgical Center employee accountability may include any or all of the following: acknowledging the risks involved with complex heal thcare delivery; acknowledging that an error occurred with possibl e r esultant injury; providing remedial or restorative care; assisting in possible root cause analysis of the processes involved; and cooperating in fixing the problem(s) in the processes. Gr eat Basin Surgical Center will ensure that processes, functions and services are designed with a focus on patient safety . This will be accomplished by using available information from within and external to the organization to design or redesign processes to minimize risk topatients. To the extent possible , the Facility will analyze or pilot test the new design or redesig n t o ensure that no new risks have been embedded into the new or redesigned process prior to it s im plementation. G reat Basin Surgical Center will seek to reduce variation in how patients are cared for in the organization and will devise strategies to avoid reliance on memory through the use of standardized protocols, checklists, work processes and use of technology/automation. P atients who are able are encouraged to actively participate in care decisions. Those who ar e i nformed of their treatment plan and properly educated and coached to question something that doesn't seem right can often prevent an error from occurring. Great Basin Surgical Center wil l i nclude patients as active participants in their care and promote patient and family questioning ofGreat Basin Surgical Center SUBJECT: Patient Safety Improvement and Management Program: Patient Safety Plan Policy # CQIP.10 APPROVED: January 2015 \u00a9Copyright 2004 Nueterra Healthcare Management, L.L.C. Revised 6/2011 P age 3 of 11 the organization's routine, procedures, and processes whenever something does not \"look\" or \"feel\" right. A s the field of patient s afety evolves, the effectiveness of various approaches to improving patient safety will be studied and evaluated. The Facility will consult the literature, examine th e e xperiences of others who have responded to similar issues, and consider recommendations mad e by various authoritative groups in developing alternatives to reduce the possibility of error or having the error reach the patient. T he facility will adopt patient safety checklists for use by providers of health care in the facility. These checkl ists will be designed to ensure that providers of health care in the facility follow recognized protocol to improve the health outcomes of patients at the facility. P atient safety checklists will include, but not be limited to: 1.Checklist for appropriately identifying a patient and ensuring that the patient is being provided treatment ordered by a provider of health care, including, without limitati on r equiring providers of health care positively to identify the patient upon each interaction. 2.Checklist for ensuring that each provider of healthcare adheres to the universal precautions protocol, including, without limitation, requiring a provider of health care t o w ash his/her hands before and after every interaction with a patient and after coming int o d irect contact with a surface or object which may be contaminated . T hese checklists will be reviewed annually by the Patient Safety Committee.

Revised 6/2011 Page 5 of 11 Scope and Components of the Patient Safety Program The Patient safety plan shall: Designate a Patient Safety O fficer Establish a Patient Safety C ommittee Establish a system for the healthcare workers of a medical facility to report serious events and incide nts. Prohibit any retaliatory action against a health care worker for reporting a serious event or incident . Reporting and notification Reporting A healthcare worker who reasonably believes that a serious event or incident has occurred shall report the serious event or incident according to the patient safety plan. The report shall be made immediately or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable, bu t in no event later than 24 hours after the occurrence or discovery of a serious event of incident. Internal Reporting: In order to have an effective patient safety improvement and management program, there must be an emphasis on reporting all types of events that may harm or ha ve harmed patients. The Facility has adopted a non- punitive approach in its management of adverse events and reporting. All members of the medical staff and employees are required to report suspected and/or identified medical errors and should do so without the fear of reprisal in relationship to their employment. The Facility focuses first and foremost on system/process improvements and will not blame the individual(s) involved in the event or seek retribution against the individua l for reporting the event. However, i n the event that a member of the medical staff or employee participates in willful or malicious misconduct, sabotage, substance abuse, criminal activity, fails to report the event truthfully or in a timely fashion, or makes an egregious error demonstrating a lack of fundamental knowledge necessary to carry out his/her job responsibilities, Great Basin Surgical Center will, as appropriate, institute disciplinary or corrective action. External Reporting: Serious events or incident s will be reported to the appropriate authorities, utilizing the required reporting format. Patient Safety Officer The patient safety officer of the facility shall perform the following: Coordinate and s erve on the P atient S afety C ommittee that meets monthly Ensure the investigation of all reports of serious events and incidents Great Basin Surgical Center SUBJECT: Patient Safety Improvement and Management Program: Patient Safety Plan Policy # CQIP.10 APPROVED: January 2015 \u00a9Copyright 2004 Nueterra Healthcare Management, L.L.C.

We are committed to the care, dignity and improvement of human life to the patient populations we serve. In keeping with the mission of the FLAMINGO SURGERY CENTER , community, and regulatory standards for ambulatory surgical care, this plan allows for a planned, systematic, organization-wide approach to the quality improvement process, reducing risks through an effective risk management plan and improving patient safety . The activities will be carried out in a collaborative and interdisciplinary manner. When identified, individual competency issues and process changes will be coordinated with management and human resources. The overall strategies of the program include Improving patient safety and reducing risk to patients which includes, but not limited to medication and radiation safety, safe quality care and reducing risk of injury to patients; Reducing medical/health system errors and hazardous conditions by creating an environment in which patients, their families, surgery center staff, and medical staff are able to identify and manage actual or potential risks to patient safety; Assuring that quality improvement initiatives continue to focus on high priority areas of clinical care, monitoring of process and outcome indicators; redesigning processes and systems and providing education to foster improvement; Positioning the FLAMINGO SURGERY CENTER to achieve earning expectations and maintain effective cost-containment strategies while providing high quality of patient care, and Meeting the expectations of external regulatory and accrediting bodies through the identification of opportunities to improve patient care, demonstration of appropriate action taken, and follow up on the effectiveness of action taken. Strategies will be incorporated in each of the following areas to identify opportunities and set goals to achieve and sustain the desired results: Performance Improvement Process Quality Studies Risk Management Strategies Patient Safety Infection Control Strategies Medication Safety Radiation Safety HCA Patient Safety Organization (PSO), LLC HCA established a Patient Safety Organization, LLC in spring of 2014 in accordance with provisions of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (Public Law 109-41). The PSO is a component of its parent entity, HCA. The mission of the PSO is to conduct activities to improve patient safety and the quality of healthcare delivery. The vision is to assist participating providers in the elimination of preventable patient harm. The activities of the organization include Improve patient safety and the quality of health care delivery Collect and analyze Patient Safety Work Product (PSWP) - 2 - Develop and disseminate information regard ing patient safety Utilize PSWP to encourage a culture of safety and provide assistance to effectively minimize patient risk. Maintain procedures to preserve confidentiality and provide appropriate security of PSWP Utilize qualified medical personnel Oper ate a patient safety evaluation system (PSES) and provide feedback to participants of the PSO. In early 2016, Flamingo Surgery Center will begin to participate as a member of the HCA Patient Safety Organization (PSO), LLC. The Administrator will serve as the designated PSO Contact and oversees all activities of the PSO for the center. The Risk/Quality Manager shall serve as the Contact Designee. The Center will provide patient safety work products (PSWP) documents as requested by the PSO. The center w ill receive information from the PSES to evaluate opportunities for improving patient safety and quality care. All information submitted will remain confidential within the PSO. Quality Improvement Plan The Center maintain s an ongoing quality improve ment program that has a broad scope to address administrative, clinical, and cost effective performance. The program also addresses patient outcomes, patient care processes and patient safety. Elements of the program include, but are not limited to a Written plan that addresses the scope of health care services provided by the Center and how the quality improvement plan for these services is assessed. Interdisciplinary QI committee for the development, implementation, review and oversight of the program. The committee has administrative, clinical and physician participation. Set of goals and objectives that a re reviewed and updated at least annually. Quality improvement activities such as audits and studies to identify problems with processes or patient care, evaluate them, and dev elop action plans when indicated . The studies will be done utilizing the ten (10) step process that is current practice in quality performance improvement. Measurement of data against internal and external benchmarking sources. Annual reviews of the effectiveness of the program . Periodic reports t o Governing Body that encompasses a summary of the quality improvement activities, findings and process changes if indicated. Risk Management and Pat ient Safety Definitions of Pot ential Risk Issues Event: A discrete, auditable and clearly defined occurrence (NQF) Occurrence: The action, fact, or instance of something that happens synonymous with an event; An event, situation, or process that contributes to, or has the potential to contribute to, a patient or visitor injury, or degrade our ability to provide optimal patient care. Reportable occurrences can generally be divided into the following types based on severity: Sentinel events, patient and visitor injuries, (adverse even ts), near misses, and safety concerns. (NPSF) Incident: Synonymous with occurrence or event. An occurrence or event that interrupts normal procedure and can precipitate an untoward or unplanned outcome, an unusual event that occurs at the facility, such as an injury to a patient. Involved damage that is limited to parts of a unit, whether the failure disrupts the system or not. (NPSF) A patient safety event that reached the patient, whether or not the patient was harmed. (NQF) Adverse Event: Any devi ation from usual medical care that causes an injury to the patient or poses a risk of harm. Events include errors, preventable adverse events, and hazards. An incident in which a - 3 - patient is harmed (WHO). An injury or risk thereof caused by medical manag ement rather than the underlying disease. An untoward, undesirable, and usually unanticipated occurrence. An act of commission or omission arising during clinical care which causes physical or psychological injury to a patient regardless of severity, (N QF & NPSF). Any injury caused by medical care. An adverse event does not imply \"error,\" \"negligence,\" or poor quality care. It simply indicates that an undesirable clinical outcome resulted from some aspect of diagnosis or therapy, not an underlying dis ease process (AHRQ). Adverse events may be preventable or non -preventable (WHO). Sentinel event: A sentinel event is a patient safety event (not primarily related to the natural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition) that reaches the p atient and results in any of the following (HCA policy definition): Death Permanent harm Severe temporary harm In the ambulatory surgical setting, an event is also considered sentinel if it is one of the following: Discharge of an infant to the wrong fam ily Abduction of any patient receiving care, treatment and services. Any elopement (that is, unauthorized departure) of a patient, leading to death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm to the patient. Hemolytic transfusion reaction involving administr ation of blood or blood products having major blood group incompatibilities (ABO, Rh, other blood groups). Rape, assault (leading to death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm), or homicide of a staff member , licensed independent practitioner, visitor , or vendor while on side at the hospital. Invasive procedure, including surgery, on the wrong patient, at the wrong side, or that is the wrong (unintended) procedure. Unintended retention of a foreign object in a patient after an invasive procedure, inclu ding surgery. Prolonged fluoroscopy with cumulative dose >1,500 rads to a single field. Fire, flame, or unanticipated smoke, heat, or flashes occurring during an episode of patient care. Close Call: Events or situations that could have resulted in an adv erse event (accident, injury, or illness), but did not, whether by chance or through timely intervention. Such events have also been referred to as \"near Miss\" incidents. An example of a close call would be a surgery or other procedure almost performed o n the wrong patient due to lapses in verification of patient identification, but caught prior to the procedure (Source: VA Patient Safety Program). Reportable Event : Any event that is mandated to report by regulatory agencies or corporate within defined time frame. ( HCA, CMS, FDA, SMDA, and/or local /state agencies). Root Cause Analysis (RCA ): A method of problem solving that tries to identify the root causes of faults or problems. RCA practice tries to solve problems by attempting to identify and corre ct the root causes of events, as opposed to simply addressing their symptoms. By focusing correction on root causes, problem recurrence can be prevented. An analysis is done after an event has occurred. All staff members involved, as well as, the Risk Man ager, physicians involved shall participate in the root cause analysis. RCA is typically used as a reactive method of identifying event(s) causes, revealing problems and solving them. The RCA findings are reported at the quality meetings, MEC and GB meet ings. In 2016, the ASD will be moved toward an online program for analysis of serious events called Serious Event Analysis (SEA). The Center maintain s an ongoing risk management program that is designed to protect the life, safety and welfare of the patie nts and employees. Risk management addresses strategies from the organizational, operational, human resource and liability areas of the organization. Goals of the program include - 4 - Improving patient safety and reducing risk to patients; Reducing medical/heal th system errors and hazardous conditions by creating an environment in which patients, their families, surgery center staff, and medical staff are able to identify and manage actual or potential risks to patient safety Reviewing and tracking of all varian ce reports and litigations for trends. Reviewing and tracking of all adverse outcomes , near misses (close calls) or sentinel events to identify gaps or opportunities for improvement . Maintaining a strong credentialing and privileging process and current by laws that meet community standards Keeping abreast of current standards for risk management and adapting practice and policies that are compliant with standards. It is evident through the goals, activities and processes that the quality improvement and risk management programs intertwine and cross all spectrums of the organization . Quality care, as well as patient and employee safety is at the center focus of both programs. The operational linkage between Risk management, Safety, Quality and Infection Control is accomplished through the following mechanisms: Issues or trends identified through chart reviews, peer reviews , safety and infection control rounds are discussed and referred to the appropriate department for evaluation and/or corrective action Data from variances , identified trends, adverse events or any events that impact the quality or safety of patient care will be reviewed and referred to appropriate risk and leadership personnel for investigation, analysis and corrective action The Risk m anager will review current issues and risk reduction strategies with appropriate personnel and develop a plan of action . This will be reported to MEC/GB. The Quality Committee will serve as the oversight committee for Patient Safety and Risk management. Medication Safety and Radiation Safety fall within a subsection of the Quality Committee and will be addressed as indicated. These plans engage active involvement of all members of the healthcare team, as well as patients and families, addressing an envi ronment which: Encourages recognition and acknowledgment of opportunities to improve quality performance and to reduce risks to patient safety , Initiates actions to improve processes or reduce these risks , Encourages internal reporting of what has been fou nd and the actions taken; Focuses on processes and system , Minimizes individual blame or retribution for involvement in a medical/health care error; and Challenges leaders of the organization to be responsible for fostering a \"non punitive\" culture of continuous improvement and creating a safe environment. Peer Review Ambulatory Surgery Centers are required by AAAHC, CMS, and other regulatory agencies to conduct quality improvement and peer review. Peer review activities include ongoing random review, spe cialty specific review and review of complications. Whenever possible, peer review is done by a physician of like specialty. Whenever possible to avoid conflict of interest, peer review cases will be referred to physicians who are not affiliated with th e practitioner being reviewed, and no physician will review a patient's care in which she/he has been professionally involved. Provisions are made to have cases evaluated by an outside expert when necessary . Confidentiality All quality improvement and pe er review activities and data are considered confidential. Any requests for outside sources for any QI, Risk management, Peer Review or credentialing information or reports will be forwarded to the appropriate HCA administrative/corporate staff when indic ated. - 5 - ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE AND PROCEDURE Role of Leadership Leaders play a key role in facilitating improvement.

Clinical leaders will receive periodic training on any updates to initiatives , new s tatistical reporting or other information as indicated. Ongoing Measurement Ongoing measurement is overseen by the Quality/ Risk Manager in collaboration with the Facility Administrator and Medical Director. These are outlined on the addendum to this p lan. Design of New Processes When FLAMINGO SURGERY CENTER is considering a new process ( for example , providing a new patient service, constructing a new facility, or redesigning an existing service), a multidisciplinary team will be convened to en sure that the process considers: The organization's mission, vision and strategic plans; Patient and community needs; Information about performance and outcomes of the process (including information from reference data bases). Current evidence based prac tice and research Current regulatory standards Periodic Assessment and Improvement Based on ongoing review of measurement data, this plan provides for assessment of dat a against historical trends and available benchmarks whenever possible. All measure s are reviewed quarterly by the Quality Committee , Medical Executive Committee and Governing Board . Assessment is automatically triggered for any of the following: By any sentinel event; By important undesirable single events, which include at a minimum : o Credentialing or bylaw violation o \"Near miss\" event o Significant injury or death o Any significant untoward event during moderate sedation or anesthesia; o Any serious adverse drug or medication error event; and o Any significant hazardous conditio n. o Any sig nificant infection control breech or trend By important undesirable patterns or trends, which include at a minimum: o Staffing effectiveness or clinical issues; o Any quality measure that varies substantially from an expected range; and o When the organization 's performance significantly varies below that of other ambulatory surgery settings or recognized standards . Select quality data is submitted to corporate and trended with internal benchmarks across the company. This information is shared at the facili ty, division and corporate level. This information is used to develop corporate wide quality and risk initiatives and for external benchmarking in the ambulatory surgery arena. In addition to ongoing measurement, the Center may at an y time proactive ly assess its culture of patient safety as well as specific processes of care that have been within the healthcare industry as having the potential to harm patients . Also the Center may periodically assess processes using tools provided from a variety o f outside sources to identify potential risks to patients and opportunities for improvement. - 8 - ONGOING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS Customer Satisfaction Surveys Patient surveys done after discharge ( written survey, call, email) Post op phone calls Employee Surveys as designated by corporate Physician surveys as designated b corporate Patient complaints ( response and corrective action ) Physician complaints ( response and corrective action) Patient Flow On time start of su rgical cases Consistent delays in surgeries Turn around time Cases pulled correctly Equipment issues Cancelled cases ( pre and intra -op ) Anesthesia Care Conscious sedation monitoring standards are standardized and consistent Anesthesia Care: complicatio n rates for general/regional, assessment and plan of care developed prior to the start of anesthesia , physiological monitoring Annual malignant hyperthermia drill Pre-op Care Completion of One Medical Passport prior to day of procedure Appropriate follow through on obtaining pre -op diagnostic studies per anesthesia guidelines and follow up on abnormal reports Pre op instructions DVT assessment - Including use of SCD when indicated Falls Assessment Sleep Apnea Assessment Intra -op Care and Processes Time O ut/correct site process Retained f oreign bodies Wrong sites Near misses Blood usages Complications Complications Unexpected complications Post op DVT /PE Transfers to acute care ( Direct Admits) Hospitalization or ED visit within 72 hours of discharge ( Indirect Admits) Variances of expected performance through clinical record review Mortality within 7 days of procedure or related to procedure Falls Burns Loss of Vision - 9 - Resuscitaton Code blue drill(s)- Adult and Pediatric if there is a pediatric populatio n Crash carts , Malignant Hyperthermia carts checked according to policy Diagnostics Results Pre-op diagnostic studies clinically reviewed and documented.

EYE SURGERY CENTER OF NORTHERN NEVADA 1 Policy and Procedure Section 8-1 Subject: QUALITY IMPROVEMENT RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN Review: Annually Effective Date: 07/01/07 Date of Revision:05/12/08 Policy Statement: ESCNN maintains an active, integrated, organized, peer -based continuous quality improvement program. The ASC utilizes a systematic approach for Performance Improvement through multidisciplinary cooperation. Quality Improvement activities demonstrate the systematic, \"closing the loop\" process. This process incorporates an improvement model that includes design, identification of problems/concerns in the care of patients; (evaluation) of the identification of problems/concerns; (resolution measures); re-evaluation; reporting. The plan will address clinical, administrative, cost-of-care issues and patient outcomes. The focus will be activities that affect the majority of patients serviced and consider high-risk, high-volume, and problem-prone patients. The following plan is an integral part of the ASC's overall goal of continually improving organizational performance and patient health outcomes.

AREAS OF RISK/STUDY: The Committee has identified three major areas of risk/study. These areas are Quality Improvement, Risk Management and Patient Satisfaction. Separate risk analysis and program definition has been performed for each area and is summarized herein. EYE SURGERY CENTER OF NORTHERN NEVADA 7 1. Quality Improvement consists of three significant components: Quality of Care (including Peer Review), Cost of Care, and Administrative issues. These are discussed in turn. A. Quality of Care. Within this component, numerous aspects of care exist which require regular and consistent review and evaluation. The Committee has designated the following elements as requiring daily attention: a. Verify equipment function within proper limits for: Refrigerators, Defibrillator, and Surgical Lasers. Confirm cleanliness of all equipment. b. Nursing care is appropriate with respect to IV starts, medication administration, patient preparation, and turnover time. c. Medical records are complete and accurate, physically present in the operating suite and legible. Ascertain that the surgeon verifies all laboratory results, if applicable. d. Patient condition and care is documented with respect to: i. Proper placement of bed side-rails in the up position. ii. Any ambulation problems post-operatively. iii. Nausea or vomiting. iv. Maintenance of continuity of surgery. v. Glucose testing performed on all known diabetic patients. vi. Blood oxygen levels below 90 percent are properly documented and evaluated prior to surgery. e. Anesthesia care is documented as to the success of conscious sedation (when utilized), local or regional blocks (when utilized), general anesthesia (when utilized), volume of medication administered, and mixture of anesthetic utilized. (Refer to daily QI Tracking Record for indicators.) Additional indicators include existence of: i. Tooth damage ii. Stridor, laryngospasm, obstruction iii. Prolonged respiratory depression iv. Pulmonary aspiration v. Cardiac arrhythmia vi. Hypertension vii. Prolonged sedation viii. Orbital bleed EYE SURGERY CENTER OF NORTHERN NEVADA 8 ix. Vomiting > 3 episodes x. Perforation of globe xi.

This data is to be collected daily and compiled monthly. Following monthly compilation, the data should be reviewed by the Clinical Director of ESCNN to identify any adverse trends or real or potential problems or concerns that may affect the quality of patient care. g. Issues so identified will be considered quality improvement problems and the appropriate study methodology, as described in Section 1 of the Plan, should be applied. h. Other elements of the operation of the Center designated by the Committee for periodic review include: i. Nursing staff should be monitored to insure that current licensure is maintained and professional development activities are adequate to insure skills remain sharp. When required, ACLS status is ascertained and appropriate levels of productivity are achieved. Current copies of licenses are to be obtained and maintained in each individual's personnel file. Annual performance evaluations will be conducted. ii. Patient care concerns in this category include comfort of medications administered, safety issues (including falls), all required transfers to a hospital, all unplanned vitrectomies, treatment of pathology specimens, and all nosocomial infections. iii. An additional concern to be addressed at least annually is adequate documentation of the appropriateness of the surgical decision. i. The final element designated by the Committee, as a required element of quality improvement monitoring is peer review. It is the responsibility of the Clinical Director of ESCNN to establish appropriate peer review relationships in the areas of surgical care and anesthesia care. Further, appropriate peer review of the medical records and procedures of the Center shall be performed at least annually. EYE SURGERY CENTER OF NORTHERN NEVADA 9 j. Responsibility for the implementation of this segment of the Plan is placed upon the Clinical Director of ESCNN. k. Cost of Care. These issues are critical to the continued successful operation of the Center. The Committee notes the relationship of these issues to quality of care and the following elements are believed to exhibit significant cost of care concerns: i. New equipment purchases. Scope for mandatory study is established as $15,000.00 ii. Cost of existing or planned new services, including the impact of new regulatory requirements. iii. Change or replacement of equipment. Scope for mandatory study is established as $15,000.00 iv. Purchasing methods, particularly as they relate to regulatory compliance (e.g., \"bundling\"). v. Monitoring and control of cost per case for surgery and other procedures as their significance warrants. vi. Responsibility for the implementation of this segment of the Plan is placed upon the Clinical Director of ESCNN. l. Administrative. This set of issues includes operational, financial and personnel management elements. Specific concerns of the Committee include: i.

SUBJECT : PATIENT SAFETY PLAN POLICY NUMBER : 7.2 I ntroduction: S afety at Elite Endoscopy encompasses: i.T he environment of care; and ii. The process of care. T he environment of care is addressed in the Environmental Standards, and Safety and Infection Control Plan, while this document addresses the process of care. P urpose: A s part of a continuous focus on the safe delivery of healthcare services, the Patient Safety Program was established as an interdisciplinary collaborative effort. T he purpose of the Patient Safety Program is to identify and effectively resolve events that result in, or have the potential to result in adverse patient care outcomes. The program is also designed to examine existing patient care processes and identify and affect improvements that reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. In achieving s uch, Elite Endoscopy has cultured an environment that encourages: i.T he recognition and acknowledgement of medical/health care errors and thei r r isks to patient safety; ii. The initiation of actions to reduce these risks; iii. The internal reporting of what has bee n found and the actions taken; iv. A focus on processes and systems; v. A non -punitive culture with minimization of individual blame or retribution for involvement in a medical/health care error; and vi. Organizational learning about medical/health care errors.TYPE: SAFETY TITLE : PATIENT SAFETY PLAN ADOPTED : 8/1/2006 LAST APPROVED: 01/12/2016 Scope of Program Activities: The scope of the Patient Safety Program is designed to support and reflect Elite Endoscopy's commitment to fostering a culture of safety, service and continuous improvement to assure the highest -quality patient care. The Patient S afety Program is broad in its scope and includes patients, visitors, and staff. The program addresses maintenance and improvement of safety issues in the facility. Objectives: The objectives of the Patient Safety Program are as follows: i. Establish and convene an appropriate group to develop and monitor Patient Safety Program initiatives; ii. Develop an awareness of the Patient Safety Plan; iii. Develop knowledge and skills related to the analysis of patient safety events; iv. Prioritize and effect patient safety imp rovements; v. Determine if corrective actions and improvements are effective; and vi. Report to the Governing Body at least annually. Responsibilities: All personnel will participate in the patient safety program. All personnel are responsible for reporting patient occurrences and potential occurrences. Patient Safety will be under the direction of the Quality Assurance Patient Safety Committee and wi ll assist with the identification, coordination and implementation of patient safety initiatives. Non-Punitive Reporting Culture An effective Patient Safety Program cannot exist without optimal reporting of medical/health care errors and occurrences. The refore, Elite Endoscopy strives for a non - punitive approach in its management of errors and occurrences. Personnel are required to report suspected and identified medical/health care errors, and should do so without the fear of reprisal in relationship to their employment. Elite Endoscopy supports the concept that errors occur due to a breakdown in systems and processes, and focuses on improving systems and processes, rather than disciplining those responsible for errors and occurrences. A focus is place d on remedial actions to assist, rather than punish, staff members. Any identified instances of incompetence, negligence, and malfeasance that are discovered and ascertained during the evaluation of errors and occurrences are forwarded to Medical Director. Methodology: Identification of Medical/ Health Care Errors: The identification of medical/health care errors includes, but is not limited, to the following mechanisms: Incident reporting (which includes adverse drug reactions and emergency patient transfer), and Sentinel Event Reporting Options for reporting patient events are continuously being explored and will be included as they are approved. Response to medical/health care errors Upon identification of a medical/health care error, the staff imme diately: i. Performs emergency healthcare interventions (if necessary) to treat the patient's clinical condition. As appropriate to the occurrence, necessary healthcare interventions are performed to contain the risk to others. ii. Contacts the patient's providing physician and/or other physicians, as appropriate, to report the error and carryout any physician orders as necessary. iii. Reports the medical/health care error to the Director of Nursing and preserves any information related to the error (including physical information). Preservation of information includes documenting facts regarding the error on an occurrence report and in the medical record as appropriate. iv. Submits the report of occurrence to the Quality Assurance Committee for review under Risk M anagement. v. Patients and, when appropriate, their families are informed about the outcomes of care, this includes unanticipated adverse outcomes - a result that differs significantly, and adversely, from what was anticipated from a treatment or procedure. Classification of Medical/Health Care Errors Elite Endoscopy defines medical/health care error as an unintended event during the process of care. Nevada Digestive classifies unintended events during the process of care by \"clinical significance\" which c orrelates with injury severity and ranges from none to catastrophic. This classification process assists the organization in determining the types of analysis that may be applied to the event. For example, a Root Cause Analysis is always completed for tho se errors classified as Sentinel Events. 1. Events of No Clinical Significance -there is no evidence of injury to the patient. 2. Events of Minor Clinical Significance - these events result in only first aid care (no additional procedures, tests, medications, or increased length of stay or increased level of care). 3. Events of Moderate Clinical Significance - these events result in additional procedures, tests, or medications, or transfer to a hospital. 4. Events of Major Clinical Significance - these events result in, surgical intervention, and transfer to a hospital. 5. Events of Catastrophic Clinical Significance (Sentinel Event) - An event involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof, including any process variation for which a recurrence would carry a significant chance of serious adverse outcome. Serious injury specifically includes loss of limb or function. Sentinel event criteria includes: i. An event that has resulted in an unanticipated death or major, permanent loss of function, not related to the natural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition. ii. An infant abduction or discharge to the incorrect family. iii. The rape of a patient. iv. A hemolytic transfusion reaction. v. Surgery on the wrong patient or body part; and the suicide of a patient (where the patient received \"around the clock\" care. The type of analysis will be determined after ev aluation of the event by the Quality Assurance Committee. Prioritization of Safety Improvement Activities: In a continuing effort to prevent errors and improve patient safety, Elite Endoscopy's Patient Safety Program utilizes internal and external informational resources, to identify potential improvements in patient safety. Patient complaints, occurrence reporting, State and Federal recommendations, and current literature, including the National Quality Forum (NQF) compilation of Best Patient Safety Practices, will be collected and utilized in the program. Patient Education and Patient Responsibilities: Staff educates patients and their families about their respective roles in helping to facilitate the safe delivery of care. Patients are given information of their rights and responsibilities upon admission Staff Education: Staff receives education and training during their initial orientation process and on a continuing basis. The education includes, but is not limited to; the need and process of reporting medical/health care errors, and the identification and disclosure of potential risks of healthcar e errors Patient Safety Assessment: The Patient Safety Program includes at a minimum, an annual assessment of patients, their families, and staff (including medical staff) opinions, needs and perceptions of risks to patients, and request suggestions for i mproving patient safety. Governing Body The Governing Body is responsible and accountable for the approval of the Patient Safety Plan and the oversight of the Patient Safety Program. The Governing Body supports the appropriation of the resources necessary to address identified patient safety issues. Elite Endoscopy's progress with Patient Safety initiatives is evaluated and actions are planned based on the conclusions and recommendations forwarded to it by the Quality Assurance Committee. Quality Assurance Committee/Patient Safety Committee The Quality Assurance Committee/Patient Safety Committee is charged with developing and monitoring the Patient Safety Program. The Quality Assurance Committee is knowledgeable of ongoing safety activities, and promotes new initiatives when necessary. Under the Patient Safety Program, the Quality Assurance Committee/Patient Safety Committee is responsible for: Enhancing Elite Endoscopy's commitment to patient safety Facilitating and coordinating patient safety activities. SUBJECT : PATIENT SAFETY POLICY NUMBER : 7.3 Purpose: To identify and eliminate potential safety hazards, thereby reducing risk to patients, personnel, and visitors. Policy: Patient safety refers to a systematic program to minimize preventable physical injuries, accidents, and undue psychological stress during the visit. The nursing practice for safety standards is a follows: 1. The procedure nurse always identifies the patient using two patient identifiers, such as by checking the wristband with the patient's chart and procedure schedule. In addition, the RN always verifies patient identification through verbal communication with the patient. 2. Staff shall u se only acceptable abbreviations for medication orders. 3. Patients are on beds which are at the lowest level, with the side rails up at all times until the procedure starts. 4. All equipment and appliances must be set up and used according to the recommendation s and instructions of the manufacturer. All new electrical equipment must be inspected prior to use and every year thereafter, by a CME. 5. Proper placement of the electrosurgical ground pad is essential to prevent electrical burns. Coagulation/cutting setti ngs on the electrosurgical units are set at the lowest setting and gradually increased. 6. Flammable solutions (i.e. alcohol) are not to be utilized when electrocautery is in progress. 7. All Biohazardous wastes, including glass, are placed in the special collection container marked \"Biohazardous Waste\" and disposed of by a contracted service provider. TYPE: SAFETY TITLE : PATIENT SAFETY ADOPTED : 8/1/2006 LAST APPROVED: 01/12/2016 8. Under normal conditions, extension cords shall not be used. Temporary use of extension cords may be permitted under specified conditions and with proper approva l. 9. Use of adaptors within the Center is prohibited.

The Facility will focus on issues of known frequency, prevalence or severity, and shall give precedence to issues that affect health outcomes, quality of care, and patient safety. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) is a continuous process. The QAPI program will be proactive, comprehensive, ongoing, and data driven. The goal of QAPI involves: The data collected will be used to monitor the effectiveness and safety of services and quality of care provided and to identify opportunities that could lead to improvements and changes in patient care. Data will be analyzed to monitor the Facility's performance and to determine what the data suggests about the Facility's quality of care and effectiveness of safety of its services. Analysis will take place at regular intervals to enable detection of problem areas in a timely manner. Investigation into root causes for any adverse event will be conducted. Following the analysis of data and identification of opportunities for improvement, the Facility will develop specific changes in its policies, procedures, equipment, environment, process, etc. to accomplish improvements in the identified areas of weakness. The Facility will implement preventive strategies designed to reduce the likelihood of an adverse event. Implementation of strategies to ensure the improvements made are sustained over time will be done. Staff will be made aware of strategies adopted for prevention of adverse events. Combinations of methodologies are used to provide a systematic approach to process improvement. Utilization of the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) problem-solving framework, throughout the Facility, enables all employees to systematically work through performance improvement initiatives. At a minimum, the Facility will be required to have two distinct performance improvement initiatives annually that reflect the scope and complexity of service provided. Documentation of the projects will include the reason for implementing the project and a description of the project's results. Records will be kept on the chosen performance improvement projects. The Quality Indicator Dashboard will be reviewed and updated at least annually by Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Committee and the Board of Directors. Performance Improvement initiatives and quality indicators will be prioritized based on the following criteria: Quality Assessment & Performance Improvement Program & Patient Safety Plan.

Indicators scoring red for three consecutive months or greater will be required to begin a ninety (90) day performance improvement action plan. The Administrator or leader for the area will oversee the plan and provide necessary resources for the project. Patient Safety is a priority at the Facility. The Patient Safety Plan is designed to support and promote the Facility's mission to provide safe, quality patient care. The plan engages staff, medical staff, patients, and visitors in activities and practices designed to promote safety and prevent patient injury and harm associated with medical errors and hazardous conditions in the health care setting. An important aspect of Performance Improvement is the identification and management of processes and behaviors leading to potential or actual patient harm. The Facility Patient Safety Program includes the ongoing assessment, tracking, and trending of patient safety events, and determination of further action, should action be deemed necessary. The authority of the Patient Safety Plan rests with the Board of Managers (BOM). The BOM delegates authority to the QAPI Committee to implement and maintain the activities described in the plan. All staff share responsibility and accountability to employ safe patient practices in alignment with the Facility policies and procedures. The Facility engages in proactive risk reduction approaches to (re)design processes to improve patient safety before an event occurs with potential or actual harm to patients. The approaches include: The Facility encourages the patient and family to become partners and participants in their care. The patient participation strategies include: Quality Assessment & Performance Improvement Program & Patient Safety Plan. Retrieved 01/08/2016.

The program implementation and oversight is under the leadership of the QAPI Committee with the participation of staff responsible for patient safety, risk management, and quality improvement functions. The Patient Safety Plan and Program exists in concert with the Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Plan/Program and the Risk Management Plan. Regular reports and recommendations are submitted to the Board of Managers. The effectiveness of the Plan and Program are evaluated annually by the QAPI Committee and Board of Managers. The overall effectiveness and efficacy of the program is evaluated annually by reviewing the following: Types of patient safety or medical errors included in review and analysis include, but are not limited to: actual or near-miss events; potential and actual adverse drug events; sentinel events (reference: Sentinel Event Management Policy). Any sentinel event or undesirable outcome will trigger an immediate response from the Director of Nursing as well as other Senior Leadership, as appropriate. A Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is conducted on all sentinel events and an action plan formulated to identify strategies the organization will implement to mitigate the risk of similar occurrences in the future. All other event types are reviewed and action taken as appropriate (reference sentinel event management policy). Aggregate variance report information will be presented quarterly to the Board of Managers. Should an issue or trend be identified, direction and resources for further investigation or a ninety (90) day action plan, will be Quality Assessment & Performance Improvement Program & Patient Safety Plan.

(800) 538- 6264PURPOSE: The purpose of the Organizational Patient Safety Plan at 215 Surgery Center is to improve patient safety and reduce risk to patients through an environment that encourages: Recognition and acknowledgment of risks to patient safety and medical/health care errors; The initiation of actions to reduce these risks; The internal reporting of what has been found and the actions taken; A focus on processes and systems; Minimization of individual blame or retribution for involvement in a medical/healthcare error; Organizational learning about medical/health care errors; Support of the sharing of that knowledge to effect behavioral changes in itself andother healthcare organizations. The Patient Safety Plan provides a systematic, coordinated and continuous approach to themaintenance and improvement of patient safety through the establishment of mechanismsthat support effective responses to actual occurrences; ongoing proactive reduction inmedical/health care errors; and integration of patient safety priorities into the new designand redesign of all relevant organization processes, functions and services. As patient care, and therefore the maintenance and improvement of patient safety, is a coordinated and collaborative effort, the approach to optimal patient safety involves multiple departments and disciplines in establishing the plans, processes and mechanisms thatcomprise the patient safety activities at Seven Hills Surgery Center. The Patient SafetyPlan, developed by the interdisciplinary Safety Committee and approved by the medicalstaff, Board of Managers and administration, outlines the components of the organizational Patient Safety Program.215 SURGERY CENTERSUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY PLAN REFERENCE #1067 PAGE: 7 EFFECTIVE: 1/15/2014 APPROVED BY: Governing Body REVISED: Ambulatory Care EOC \u00a9 Medical Consultants Network Inc.

Patient safety occurrence information fromaggregated data reports and individual incident occurrence reports will be reviewedby the Safety Committee to prioritize organizational patient safety activity efforts.Types of patient safety or medical/health care errors included in data analysis are: No Harm Errors - those unintended acts, either of o mission or commission, or acts that do not achieve their intend outcome - that do not result in a physical or psychological negative outcome, or the potential for a negative outcome,for the patient. Mild-Moderate Adverse Outcome Errors - those unintended acts, either of omission or commission, or acts that do not achieve their intend outcome,that result in an identified mild to moderate physical or psychological adverseoutcome for the patient. Any Medication Error Any Adverse Drug Reaction Hazardous Condition - any set of circumstances, exclusive of the disease or condition for which the patient is being treated, which significantly increasesthe likelihood of a serious physical or psychological adverse patient outcome. Sentinel Event - as defined in Appendix A of the National Quality Forum Serious Reportable Events in Health- Care -2011 Update: A Consensus Report T he event has resulted in an unanticipated death or major permanent loss of function, not related to the natural course of the patient's illnessor underlying condition.

Description of mechanisms to ensure that all component s of the healthcare organization are integrated into and participate in the organizationwide program. Upon identification of a medical/health care error, the patient care provider willimmediately: Perform necessary healthcare interventions to protect and support thepatient's clinical condition. As appropriate to the occurrence, perform necessary healthcare interventionsto contain the risk to others - example: immediate removal of contaminated IV fluids from floor stock should it be discovered a contaminated lot of fluidsolutions was delivered and stocked. Contact the patient's attending physician and other physicians, asappropriate, to report the error, carrying out any physician orders asnecessary. Preserve any information related to the error (including physical information).Examples of preservation of physical information are: Preservation of IVtubing, fluids bags and/or pumps for a patient with a severe drug reactionfrom IV medication; preservation of medication label for medicationsadmini stered to the incorrect patient. Preservation of information includes documenting the facts regarding the error on an occurrence report, and in the medical record as appropriate to organizational policy and procedure. Report the medical/health care error to the staff member's immediate supervisor. Submit the occurrence report to the designated individual or committee per organizational policy.SUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY PLAN REFERENCE #1067 PAGE: 5 OF: 7 EFFECTIVE: 1/15/2014 APPROVED BY: Governing Body REVISED: Ambulatory Care EOC \u00a9 Medical Consultants Network Inc.

Mild-Moderate Adverse Outcome Errors (including medication errors) - staff will perform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect thepatient and notify the physician staff responsible for the patient, carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will then preserve any physicalevidence as appropriate, notify his/her immediate supervisor, document factsappropriately in the medical record and on an occurrence report - submitting the report to the Performance Improvement Department per organizationalpolicy. M edication Errors - the staff member identifying a mediation error (no harm and mild- moderate harm) will notify the Pharmacy Services Department of the event. Adverse Drug Reaction - staff will perform any necessary clinical interventions to support and protect the patient and notify the physician staff responsible forthe patient, carrying out any necessary physician orders. Staff will thenpreserve any physical evidence as appropriate, notify his/her immediate supervisor, document facts appropriately in the medical record and on anoccurrence report - submitting the report to the Performance Improvement Department per organizational policy. Staff will also notify the PharmacyServices Department. Hazardous Condition/Patient Safety Issue - as appropriate, and if possible, staff will contain the hazardous condition or patient safety issue.

Staff will then followthe organizational Sentinel Event Policy and Procedure. Near Miss - staff will report the near miss event to his/her immediate supervisor, describe the facts of the near miss on an occurrence report andsubmit the report to the Performance Improvement Department. Established organizational policy (such as the Sentinel Event Policy) and/or the Safety Committee will determine the organizational response to medical/health careerrors and occurrences. All sentinel events and near miss occurrences will have aroot cause analysis conducted. The determination of the Safety Committee members, based on internal and external data analysis and prioritizing of patientsafety criticality, will determine: Further remedial action activities necessary for identified occurrences Proactive occurrence reduction activiti es Necessity and benefit of root cause analysis performance for identifiedoccurrences or proactive reduction activities An effective Patient Safety Program cannot exist without optimal reporting ofmedical/health care errors and occurrences. Therefore, it is the intent of this institution to adopt a non- punitive approach in its management of errors and occurrences.
