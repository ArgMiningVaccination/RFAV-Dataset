This idea dates back several centuries, when British surgeon, Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine against a lethal infectious disease, small pox. Between the 18th century and now, more than 65 products have been approved which, together with public health and other developments, have contributed to the tapering and, in some cases, eradication of infectious diseases that used to kill millions. The problem is that the design is based on the physical attributes of the microbe. So, one person might be infected with virus x, which mutates rapidly to become 10 or more different strains. So, between approval and reaching the public, effectiveness may drop or wane over time. The sheer logistics of designing a trial means that follow-up periods are not long enough to account for every possible safety issue. Nevertheless, they remain our go-to defense for lethal infections, such as Ebola, and ones that reduce productivity. In other cases, timely inoculations may protect against the risk of developing specific cancers later in life. They have also contributed to the fact that most people are not at home sick with polio or some of the other ancient plagues. However, anti-infective vaccines are typically given to healthy children and people on the basis that it will not make them sick or that it will reduce the risk of premature death. Because vaccines need to be preserved, properly stored and kept free of other contamination before it reaches many distribution sites, other ingredients are added to the mix. And some people, especially those with weakened immune systems, may have severe/life-threatening allergies to additives or a contaminated batch. So, one in a million complications/deaths is one in a million too many. To this end, I have compiled a summary culled from various sources, to foster a positive dialogue towards improvements. "}
