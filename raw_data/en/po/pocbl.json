The Medical-Scientific Department would be pleased to answer your queries. Please orients itself based on the so-called 'drug picture' to determine the appropriate remedy. It claims that symptoms of disease behave reciprocally towards those symptoms which the healthy test person develops after the intake of a mother tincture or a diluted substance (potency.) The principle of action which can be derived thereof is known as the Simile Principle (Similia similibus curentur = Likes may be cured by likes.) The clinical syndrome occurring in a patient can be overcome by an artificially induced, similar disease. The Aequalia Principle (Isopathy = the condition may be healed by the causative substance) can also be applied with potentised allopathic substances or partly with nosode preparations in anti-homotoxic medicine and/or with vaccines in conventional medicine. Classical homoeopathy works with single remedies which are only partly truly single-constituent remedies, (e.g., sulphur, mercury, arsenic, etc.), or which are otherwise botanical extractions containing a highly complex mixture of numerous constituents. Repertories (lists of symptoms produced by drugs) facilitate the selection of the most appropriate remedy in homoeopathy. Anti-homotoxic medicine usually pursues an indication-oriented approach. The anti-homotoxic remedies predominantly represent mixtures of substances of low to middle potencies. Through practical application in homoeopathy it became obvious that the use of concentrated or poisonous tinctures could damage the patient and that, therefore, they could only be used in homoeopathic dilutions, i.e., potencies. This practice was scientifically supported by Rudolf Arndt (psychiatrist, 1835-1900) and Hugo Schulz (pharmacologist, 1853-1932) through a quantitative differentiation of the medicinal effect on bio-systems and still applies as the Arndt-Schulz Principle. It states: weak stimuli stimulate the life functions (retro-action of homoeopathic preparations) moderately strong stimuli accelerate them strong stimuli act as inhibitors the strongest stimuli suspend the life functions Since several tissue-incompatible substances are usually involved during the development of a disease, the simultaneous use of several potentised \"antitoxins\", as present in the anti-homotoxic preparations, is justified. Against the background of the conflicting medicinal and therapeutic concepts promulgated in humoral pathology, cellular pathology, molecular pathology, and related fields including modern cybernetics, the German physician Dr. Hans-Heinrich Reckeweg formulated Homotoxicology in 1952. This conception was developed from homoeopathy for the purpose of providing a holistic perspective on the synthesis of medical science. Reckeweg formulated an essential tenet of Homotoxicology, as follows: \"According to Homotoxicology all of those processes, syndromes, and manifestations, which we designate as diseases, are the expression thereof that the body is combating poisons and that it wants to neutralize and excrete these poisons. The body either wins or loses the fight thereby. Those processes, which we designate as diseases, are always biological, that is natural teleological processes, which serve poison defence and detoxification.\" Referring to conventional medical indications connects anti-homotoxic medicine with allopathy, while therapy with potentised substances unites it to homoeopathy. Anti-homotoxic medicine is the connecting link between allopathic medicine and homoeopathy. Fig. 1 Conventional medicine: The higher the concentration, the stronger the effect (dose-effect relation; increase of side effects). Homoeopathy: Increase of the effect with decreasing concentration (effect optimum not definable). Anti-homotoxic medicine: Connecting link between conventional medicine and homoeopathy. 1.1 Fundamental principles of Homotoxicology 1.1.1 Homotoxins Homotoxins are all of those substances (chemical/ biochemical) and non-material influences (physical, psychical), which can cause ill health in humans. Their appearance results in regulation disorders in the organism. Every illness is due therefore to the effects of homotoxins. Homotoxins can be introduced from the exterior (exogenic homotoxins) or originate in the body itself (endogenic homotoxins). 1.1.2 Homotoxons These are understood as chemical reaction products from compounds of homotoxins with each other or with other substances (e.g., products of metabolism) which neutralize the poisonous property of the homotoxins. The best example thereof is the liver, in whose cells homotoxins and metabolic products are united to detoxify the organism. 1.1.3 Retoxins Deposits of homotoxins with endogenic substances, which cannot be eliminated via excretion or irritation, are designated as \"residual poisons\" (retoxins). The most important example thereof is the non-enzymatic glucosilisation of tissues and cell surfaces in case of glucose excess, as with, among others, latent diabetes mellitus. 1.1.4 Homotoxicosis - The Concept of Disease in Homotoxicology Homotoxicosis is a non-physiological condition which arises after reaction of a homotoxin on cells and tissues. A homotoxicosis occurs as a humoral or cellular appearance and can be followed by morphological changes on tissues. The homotoxicosis is named after the homotoxin which triggers it. The homotoxicosis leads to defensive measures of the organism whose goal is to eliminate the homotoxins and to restore the physiological conditions when possible. 1.1.5 The Ground Regulation This refers to the local regulation possibilities of the ground system along with its superimposed nervous, hormonal, and humoral regulation systems. The ground system is composed of the ground substance plus cellular, humoral, and nervous components. The ground substance (extracellular matrix) is formed of highly polymerised sugars (proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans) plus structural and meshing glycoproteins. 1.1.6 The Phase theory The Six-Phase-Table illustrates the chronological courses of various symptoms of a disease within the framework of the ground regulation. The single phases are transient into each other and demonstrate typical phasal indicating signs. The Six- Phase-Table is subdivided into three sections (humoral phases, matrix phases, cellular phases), each of which is subdivided into 2 phases. Two phases are allocated to the excretion principle (phases 1 + 2), the deposition principle (phases 3 + 4), and the degeneration and/or deterioration principle (phases 5 + 6). The Biological Division runs within the matrix phases. Fig. 2: The Six-Phase-Table A) The humoral phases In the humoral phases the intracellular systems are not disturbed. The defence system is intact and can excrete the homotoxins via various paths. 1. Excretion This phase contains manifestations of increased physiolo- phase gical excretion mechanisms. 2. Reaction Illnesses of this phase are marked by an exudative inflam- phase mation, which enables an accelerated excretion of toxins from the body. B) The matrix phases In these phases the homotoxins are deposited at first in the mesh of the extracellular matrix. During the further course its structural components as well as functions are al-tered. In case of continuing illness increasing stress and damage of the intracellular structures result. 3. Deposition In this phase the excretion mechanisms of the body are phase overworked and toxins are deposited in the matrix. This phase often progresses with few symptoms. 4. Impregnation Diseases in this phase are characterized by the presence phase of toxins which become a part of the connective tissue and the matrix, along with changes in the structural com- ponents as well as their functions. The typically increasingly severe symptoms and signs of this phase demonstrate damage of the organ cells. C) The cellular phases During the cellular phases of a disease, cell systems are increasingly destroyed. The defence system is no longer able to excrete the toxins out of the cells or out of the matrix by virtue of its own strength. Typical for these phases is the so-called regulation rigidity. 5. Degeneration During this phase, courses of disease cause serious dam- phase age, and destruction of larger cell groups of an organ takes place. 6. Dedifferentiation Diseases of this phase are characterized by the devel- (neoplasm) opment of undifferentiated, non-specialized cell forms. phase Malignant diseases stand at the end of this phase. 1.1.7 Biological Division The Biological Division refers to the imaginary boundary between the deposition and impregnation phases. It demarcates the pure deposition in the matrix from the integration of toxins into its structural components. Whereas a simple excretion of the toxins is possible during the deposition phase, structural and functional changes are found in the impregnation phase. Thus the spontaneous endogenic excretion of the homotoxins is impeded. 1.1.8 Vicariation The term \"vicariation\" refers to the transition of the indicating signs of an illness within one phase to another organ system, or the change of the fundamental symptoms and signs into another phase, with or without a change of the organ system. Progressive vicariation: Progressive vicariation refers to an aggravation of the total symptoms and signs of illness. Regressive vicariation: Regressive vicariation refers to an improvement of the total symptoms and signs of an illness. 1.2 The principles of action of anti-homotoxic medicine The different components of the anti-homotoxic preparations activate the defence system of the body: Fig. 3: Functional circle of the anti-homotoxic therapy The immune system with its memory and regulation systems can be compared to the spiritual-mental self, the ego. The deposition phase, and more frequently the impregnation phase, is characterized by immunological processes such as chronic inflammations and auto-aggression. The humoral area (via immunoglobulins from the cellular area (T-cells, granulocytes, macrophages) still counterbal-ance each other in this case. A regressive vicariation is still possible in these matrix phases. Herein lies a great opportunity for anti-homotoxic medicine. The immunological bystander reaction represents a theory of anti-homotoxic therapy for inflammatory illnesses. It is based on low dose antigen reactions particularly of substance combinations in the range of D1 to D12, with D4 to D8 appearing to be the most favourable (Heine, 1997b). The bystander effect cannot be triggered at higher potencies, however experience shows that higher potencies as well as trace elements and intermediary catalysts are able to stimulate the ground regulation. (Functional circle of the anti-homotoxic therapy; Fig. 3; Heine, 1997a.) It is significant that, for the potency ranges D3 to D12, a considerable difference exists in the activation of specific enzyme systems compared to substances conventionally diluted in the same concentration. The dose-action relationship of potentised substances compared to diluted substances demonstrates thereby a non-linear relationship (Hoariest and Dittmann, 1997). Ground regulation system Every organism requires energy to maintain its vital functions which must be continuously provided by the metabolism. Therefore, disorders of the energy metabolism impair the energy supply which is controlled by the endogenic regulation. The organism is an energetically open system for which suitable energy (in the form of food) must be supplied, and unsuitable energy must be evacuated. In this manner an unstable state of order can be maintained, far from a thermodynamic balance, for a longer period of time (\"life-span\"). All reactions of the organism proceed at relatively low temperatures in the aqueous milieu, therefore they must be accelerated, i.e., catalysed. The prerequisite for an effective catalysis is suitable substrates between and in the cells. Be-cause the extracellular space is located in front of the cells, the cells can only react as they have been informed via the extracellular space. The dynamic structure of the extracellular space and its regulation (\"Ground regulation\") have therefore a decisive impact on the effectiveness of extracellular and intracellular catalysts. This depends on the structure of the ground substance (extracellular matrix and/or matrix). It forms in all cells and cell groups a molecular sieve of matrix components such as highly polymerised sugar protein complexes and sugar complexes (proteoglycans-glycosaminoglycans, PG/GAGs), structural proteins (collagen, elastin) and meshing glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin) (see Figure 4). The PG/GAGs are electro-negatively charged and are therefore able to bind water and exchange ions as well. They are therefore the guarantors for isoiony, isoosmy, and isotony in the matrix. Fig. 4: Diagram of the ground regulation Reciprocal relationships (arrows) between capillary system (capillaries, lymph vessels), ground substance, terminal autonomic axons, connective tissue cells (mast cells, defence cells, fibroblasts etc.) and parenchyma cells. Epithelial and endothelial cell groups rest on a basal membrane which mediates to the ground substance. Every cell surface carries a glycoprotein and glycolipid film connected to the ground substance (dotted line), to which the histocompatibility complexes (MHC) also belong. The ground substance is connected to the endocrine system via the capillary system and via the axons to the central nervous system. The fibroblast is the metabolically active centre. (Heine 1997b)8) The connection to the central nervous system is conducted via the autonomic nerve fibres blindly ending in the matrix. The connection to the system of endocrine glands (pituitary gland, thyroid gland, suprarenal gland, etc.) is conducted via the capillary system which permeates the matrix. Both systems are connected to each other in the brainstem and to superimposed centres of the brain (Fig. 4). In this manner the matrix is regulated not only on site but also under the influence of superimposed control areas. The regulation centre in the matrix is the fibroblast (corresponding to the glia cell in the central nervous system). It reacts immediately to all incoming information (hormones, neural substances, metabolites, catabolites, pH-value changes etc.) with a synthesis of matrix components suited to the situation. It does not differentiate thereby between \"good\" or \"bad\" information. In this manner every surplus or deficit can lead in certain circumstances to detrimental consequences for the total system depending individually on a circulus vitiosus (vicious circle). It is important to note that due to the sieve-like as well as connective properties of the PG/GAGs, the danger of slagging of the matrix also exists through the development of a latent tissue acidity, increase of free radicals, and the activation of the proteolytic system turning into a pro-inflammatory situation. Ultimately, damage of all humoral and cellular elements may arise progressing at first from persistent feelings of ill health to chronic diseases and malignant processes. (See 1.1.6, page 11; summary in Heine 1997a.)7) Immunological Bystander Reaction Whether administered orally, as aerosol, nasally, i.v., s.c. or i.m., the anti-homotoxic preparations are either directly confronted non-specifically with the macrophages/monocytes or the substances are offered to them by lymphocytes patrolling the mucosa epithelia after superficial contact. After phagocytosis the macrophages return an amino acid motive (9 to 15 amino acids) of the substances to its surface. There they are bound to the MHCI complex (histocompatibility antigens) (Fig. 4). Thus the motives for yet undetermined (\"naive\") lymphocytes (Th0) become recognizable. They accept the motives and convert themselves thereby into regulatory Th3-cells. Afterwards they wander via the lymph vessels into the nearest lymphatic node and form _motivated\" cell clones which enter the bloodstream via the post-capillary venulae and are distributed throughout the whole organism via the circulation. In dysregulatory areas, in particular inflammatory regions, the Th3-cells are chemotactically attracted (complement factors, chemokines etc.). According to their motives they can recognize inflammatory lymphocytes (T4-cells and their subpopulations T-Helper1- and T-Helper2 lymphocytes). A of the motives (the Simile Principle of anti-homotoxic medicine!) suffices thereby to stimulate Th3-cells to secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF-b (tissue growth factor-beta) and to a slight degree interleukin-4 and -10. TGF-b is the most potent anti-inflammatory cytokine in the body. It suppresses the T4- and its helper cells. The Th2-cells support thereby their own inactivation through the release of IL-4 and IL-10 through which TGF-b is considerably strengthened in its anti-inflammatory function (Fig. 4). Simultaneously the B-lymphocytes are stimulated to synthesize immunoglobulins. It remains to be noted that the immunological bystander reaction can only proceed in the low dose antigen range (ca. 1 \u00b5g to maximally 1 g per day and body weight). [An excellent overview of the literature on the phenomenon of the low dose antigen reactions (\"Bystander Suppression\") can be found in Weiner L, Meyer F. Oral tolerance: Mechanisms and Applications. Ann New York Acad Sci 1996; 778: 1-418.] As Immunology 1996; 6: 13-18) in animal experiments, the injection of a tolerated antigen, e.g., endogenic fibrinogens is not immunologically neutral: A previously stimulated bystander reaction is possibly amplified thereby! The authors also explain this with the action of suppressive cyto kines from lymphocytes. These findings fit with the progressive auto-sanguis therapy according to Reckeweg. Because the number of antigens is not known during inflammatory processes, it is very advantageous to offer a greater number of motives, as is customary in anti-homotoxic medicine, to approach an inflammatory process immunologically from several sides. (Fig. 5). The bystander reaction can be supported thereby by the auto-sanguis therapy according to Reckeweg. Thus, anti-homotoxic medicine offers great advantages because: it is not necessary to know the specific antigen in order to treat an illness of a specific organ, as similarity is sufficient (see Brandtzaeg, 1996), an adequate combination of low dose antigens must exist (D1 to approximately D14) to attain a corresponding bystander reaction, a circulating antigen blood level need not be provable (Weiner et al., 1994), individual differences occur in the reaction to various epitopes of the regulatory lymphocytes (Friedman and Weiner, 1994; Weiner et al., 1994), the bystander reaction can obviously also be triggered regardless of the method of application (oral, nasal, s.c., i.m.) (Al-Sabbagh et al., 1996; Carvalho and Vaz, 1996, Chen et al., 1996), the bystander reaction regulates dysfunctions and does not block them, a function cycle of anti-homotoxic therapy exists, which acts in a regulatory manner in the ground system. Fig. 5: The immunological bystander reaction as a principle of action of anti-homotoxic medicine A D1-D14 potency of an anti-homotoxic preparation contains sufficient substance quantities to stimulate macrophages to form antigen motives after application (top). This is the prerequisite for the formation of regulatory lymphocytes (th3) (middle Th1, Th2) with antigen suppress these by releasing TGF-b (bottem).

Medicinal-therapeutical Mechanism of Action of 2.1 The difference between anti-homotoxic preparations and single homoeopathic remedies Whereas the classically treating, homoeopathic therapist exclusively applies so-called single-constituent remedies, whose constituents are potentized according to the defined production rules of the homoeopathic pharmacopoeia and whose application is conducted after anamnesis and subsequent repertorization according to the Simile Principle, anti-homotoxic preparations are usually implemented based on the indica-tion. The anti-homotoxic preparations are usually composed of combinations of homoeopathic substances, manufactured according to the regulations of the official German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (HAB 1978), and are homoeopathic remedies according to the legal definition of the EU guideline 92/73 EC. Unlike single homoeopathic remedies, it is essential during the therapeutic implementation of anti-homotoxic preparations that these remedies are applied based on the measures of Homotoxicology according to Reckeweg. In particular this means that the physician first defines the current location of the patient as indicated on the Six-Phase-Table of Homotoxicology. Due to the phasal course of diseases the physician must pay attention to so-called vicariation effects, i.e., the shifting of a disease from one phase into another. The therapeutic goal is to shift the disease from a phase to the right of the Biological Division (phases 4 to 6) into a phase to the left of the Biological Division (phases 1 to 3). To achieve this the excretion of homotoxins must be initiated with the corresponding anti-homotoxic preparations. Due to the high complexity of chronic diseases, it is essential for the success of anti-homotoxic therapy to implement the anti-homotoxic preparations in accordance with the phases. The rule of thumb may apply thereby that in particular the so-called combination preparations are indicated for diseases in the matrix phases 3 and 4 as well as in the degeneration and dedifferentiation (neoplasm) phases. This applies essentially because, in addition to the specific classical homoeopathic active agent, further anti-homotoxic active agents such as potentized suis-organ extracts, catalysts, nosodes, and, in several cases, also the homoeopathically adjusted allopathic medications are contained in these preparations. As practice has shown, well selected single homoeopathic remedies are often not able to shift a disease from the cellular phases 4 or 5 into a regressive vicariation unless certain enzyme defects or blockades on the cellular level are previously removed by anti-homotoxic agents such as catalysts, suis-organ components, nosodes, and homoeopathically adjusted allopathic medications. The action of the indicated simile occurs only after the removal of the blockades because the homoeopathic single remedy requires a terrain which is at least still partly responsive to stimulants. Reaction blockades must be removed with other strategies such as the anti-homotoxic excretion, the progressive auto-sanguis-therapy, neural therapy, and dietetics. Experience has shown that well selected single remedies + Injeels/forte from the area of the catalysts, nosodes, and suis-organs or corresponding combinations, in particular the so-called Compositum preparations are suitable to achieve \"regressive\" vicariation. If, however, a regressive vicariation effect has occurred and the secondary or tertiary disease (locum disease) has regressed into phase 2, then the single remedies or the customary specialties of the anti-homotoxic preparations, which contain combinations of single remedies, can be successfully applied. To achieve the successful application of the anti-homotoxic preparations, the following details must be noted from the above explanations: The definition of the phase which the disease is in. The recording of vicariation effects. The excretion of homotoxins. The anti-homotoxic or homoeopathic treatment of the disease arisen after vica-riation into the excretion phase. 2.2 The treatment of diseases to the left of the Biological Division with anti-homo-toxic preparations The treatment of diseases of phases 1 to 3 can be conducted with relatively nonspecific homoeopathic substances. Nonspecific signifies in this case that the point of attack of the preparation does not concentrate on a specific, e.g., degenerately damaged organ, but that it exercises an effect upon the whole organism particularly via the blood and lymph system. Practice has shown thereby that such diseases of the humoral phase, and particularly of the deposition phase (phase 3) are very effectively treated with the progressive auto-sanguis therapy, that is, an autologous blood nosode combined with specialties and/or reaction remedies which do not belong to the Compositum preparations. Typical representatives of these preparations are, for example, nonspecifically stimulating preparations for all infectious diseases such as Gripp-Heel , Engystol or Traumeel S . The effect of these preparations is effectively amplified by the progressive auto-sanguis treatment because an additional immunological stimulus is exercised on the matrix by this autologous blood nosode. The Injeels of the single homoeopathic substances also belong in the treatment of diseases of the humoral phase because the advantage of the combination of low and high potencies is that they possess a quite conservative therapeutic efficacy usually progressing without initial aggravation. It can be presupposed for all diseases of the humoral phase that the intracellular structures are still intact and that enzyme blockades or cellular structure defects have not yet occurred. For this reason, the organism can be stimulated directly by the homoeopathic simile in terms of an antidote and this effect may possibly be amplified by the analogous blood nosode as well. The homoeopathic drug picture is defined, as is well known, based on the healthy test person who does not have a cellular illness. In the third phase, the deposition phase, the homotoxin is simply encapsulated and taken out of circulation, so to speak. This phase always occurs when the homotoxins can no longer be degraded by the body in the reaction phase. During the deposition phase the condensed homotoxins are deposited without causing structural alterations of the matrix and/or functional impairments to it. As long as the physiological filtering and protection functions can be performed by the matrix, the regular supply of the surrounding parenchyma cells and tissue is guaranteed. The situation only changes dramatically when the Biological Division is crossed, when the endogenic structure of the matrix is so burdened by more and more condensed, deposited homotoxins that it can no longer perform its filtering and protection functions. In such a case the homotoxins enter the tissue cells where they cause cellular, structural alterations in cell organelles such as mitochondria or nuclei. 2.3 The treatment of diseases to the right of the Biological Division with anti-homo-toxic preparations The phases to the right of the Biological Division possess the following common properties: They have gone through a longer development time, that is the diseases have assumed a chronic nature. As a result of the chronicity, intracellular, structural damages have, as a rule, occurred on the organelles of the cells. The structural damages are frequently due to blockades of physiological meta-bolical process chains (enzyme blockades). The matrix is severely altered in its functionality through deposits of metabolites (= homotoxins) and through the frequently accompanying acidosis. The alteration of the matrix impacts on the immunological reactions within the matrix (immunotoxically and paradoxically proceeding reactions). The proper supply of neighbouring parenchyma cells with the nutrients trans-ported via the blood capillaries is severely altered or limited (disorder of the transportation function of the matrix). Together with the alteration of the matrix and the physiological reaction of the matrix the removal of contaminants and metabolites is impeded, resulting in the retoxifying action of these waste products (homotoxins) on the parenchyma cells to be supplied. Based on the above listed alterations particularly in the matrix, the general anti-homotoxic strategy aims to repair these damages for diseases to the right of the Biological Division by: Reduction of further contaminant supply e.g., by changing the diet. Unblocking of enzyme systems particularly in the metabolically active organs such as the liver and kidneys as well as the intestinal tract and the lungs with the aid of the catalyst preparations. Elimination of the tissue acidosis, e.g., through an alkalic diet. Drainage of the matrix via the diverse detoxification techniques such as lymph drainage, physical therapy (sauna), administration of corresponding homoeo-pathic preparations (e.g., Lymphomyosot ). Therapeutic restitution of damaged intracellular structures via suitable anti-homotoxic preparations (e.g., suis-organ preparations). For the drainage of the matrix it is recommended to administer nosodes in addition to lymphatic remedies because the nosode as an isotherapeutic remedy causes a highly specified stimulus for the alteration of the toxic situation. Nosodes are, as is known, therapeutic remedies of the terrain and possess the ability to \"remind\" the body specifically of the \"similar\" or comparable general toxic situation of the diseases wich they represent. In addition it may be required for the treatment of a retoxifying action caused by frequent intake of strongly effective allopathic medications to offer the corresponding homoeopathically adjusted allopathic medication to the sick organism. By homoeopathically adjusting the allopathic medication, generally in the D6 potency and higher, a reversal of the toxic action of this medication is induced. The Arndt-Schulz law and/or the effect of hormesis provide a logical scientific explanation for this retroactive effect. The unblocking of enzymes or metabolic chains is effectively achieved by the administration of anti-homotoxic catalyst preparations such as Coenzyme compositum in alternation with Ubichinon compositum . Both preparations contain a significant combination of vitamins and co-enzymes as well as intermediary products of metabolic cycles providing energy in the homoeopathic dilution from D6. According to Schmid1) these preparations act on the molecular level on the mitochondria and assist the organism to regulate the intracellular, energy-supplying processes once again. The potencies between substitutive and can reactivate metabolic dysfunctions in energy-supplying cycles by substitution. Because every severe disease, which no longer possesses any self-healing tendencies, is coupled to dysfunction on the level of energy-supplying processes, a concomitant, possibly intermittent administration of these preparations is indicated in all cases, as frequently confirmed successfully both in human medicine and in veterinary medicine. The two catalyst preparations (Coenzyme compositum and Ubichinon compositum ) can be significantly supplemented by the administration of a trace element compound such as Molybd\u00e4n compositum. In this compound, important trace elements such as molybdenum, zinc, iron, cobalt, cerium, manganese, copper, nickel, and rubidium are combined with sulphur and phosphorus which both possess a strongly stimulative effect particularly on mucous membranes and tissue cells and which belong to the so-called reaction remedies in homoeopathy. The above-mentioned trace elements are present as salts in lower potencies between D3 and D8. In these ranges, these trace elements no longer have toxic effects, but have a purely stimulative and/or a substitutive effect. These elements catalyze several enzyme-dependent reactions. As is well known, particularly molybdenum, copper, nickel, zinc, manganese, and cobalt are elements which are essential for certain enzyme complexes, that is, these enzyme complexes cannot function without them. It can be said in summary that the Compositum preparations containing catalysts, minerals, and trace elements are indicated for all chronic diseases connected with energy deficits such as chronic fatigue syndrome or for diseases caused by old age. 2.4 The course of therapy By introducing the vicariation principle into anti-homotoxic therapy Reckeweg pointed out the dynamics of every disease and/or recovery process. The interrelations which exist between a bio-system and the damaging homotoxins vary continuously during an illness and during the recovery process. The purposeful, self-regulatory forces of the organism usually are retained during illnesses up to and including the 3rd phase of the Six-Phase Table of Homotoxicology. In contrast, after the Biological Division is crossed, from phase 4 onward, self-regulation and self-recovery is practically no longer possible for the organism. In this case, a therapeutic-medicinal treatment is required to achieve recovery. Following regressive vicariation, a disease often enters either phase 2 or 3. This usually requires the change of the anti-homotoxic preparation because in phase 2 the symptomatically indicated acute remedy is usually necessary. In phases 2 and 3, which belong to the humoral phases, the self-regulatory capacity of the organism is still present, so that only stimulative medication is required to initiate inflammatory mechanisms, particularly in the matrix. Usually the excretion of the disease occurs via the skin or the mucous membranes. Increased perspiration, sputum, strong formation of urine, light diarrhea, and fever are welcome signs of a shift out of the cellular disease phases which indicates an improvement of the basic illness. In the acute phases 1 and 2, Compositum preparations as described previously are generally no longer required but instead, preparations such as Traumeel or certain Homaccords or single-remedy Injeels are preferable. 2.5 The modes of application of anti-homotoxic preparations Anti-homotoxic preparations can be applied orally, parenterally, or locally/externally. Particularly for easily located complaints, a combination of oral with local measures, e.g., for the treatment of injuries or rheumatic diseases, is recommended. In addition, a segmental, parenteral treatment of certain areas of the body via subcutaneous or intracutaneous infiltration is a frequently practiced procedure for the treatment of painful diseases of the locomotor system. The most wide-spread mode of application is - as generally also for homoeopathic preparations - the systematic oral application via tablets or drops and/or the application of suppositories for children. If desired, ampoules can be administered orally instead of parenterally. This application is particularly recommended when alcoholic drops should not be used for small children or alcoholic patients. The application of injections is polymorphic; it includes the intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intracutaneous application, and also the segmental, the periarticular as well as - in certain cases - the intra-articular application. The parenteral application is advisable as a periarticular or subcutaneous injection especially for joint complaints and easily located pains. Through infiltration of anti-homotoxic preparations in combination with neurotherapeutical substances such as Procaine or Xylocaine freedom of complaint can be achieved quickly and without complications. Finally, the application in acupuncture or trigger points is an effective mode of application for anti-homotoxic preparations (Homoeosiniatrical Application). 2, 3, 4) 2.6 References H.

Please see detailed product information in chapter C, section 1, page 285 and section 2, page 439. 3.1 Combination preparations 3.1.1 Specialized Preparations Today, these specialized preparations are employed in practices of all types, regardless whether the practitioner is naturopathically oriented or not. These valuable medications (e.g., Vertigoheel , Traumeel S ) also find application at university clinics and similar institutions. Figure 6 represents only a limited, subjective selection from the extensive assortment of specialized preparations available. Fig. 6: Selection from the range of specialized preparations Preparation Chief Indications Cralonin Geriatric heart, cardiac neurosis Engystol Colic, arthrosis, sports injuries Vertigoheel of various preparations which contain one or several active substances in respective potency chords. Usually a low potency is combined with a medium potency and a higher potency. The background of this potency combination is the nearly 100 year old therapeutic experience that the simultaneous administration of low, medium, and higher potencies causes a reduction of the initial aggravation. As is known, initial aggravations occur particularly often during the administration of higher potencies given individually. Homaccords are available both as attenuations for oral administration as well as in ampoule form for subcutaneous injection. This multipotent form - among other applications - is particularly appropriate for treating chronic illnesses. In the ampoule form of the Homaccords, the individual constituents' potency-levels are generally two to three stages higher than those found in the drops. These highly-potentised elements exert a subduing effect on any possible initial reactions, hence cases displaying initial aggravation are a rarity. 3.1.3 Composita Preparations In order to obtain a preparation which is highly effective on the one hand, yet low in risk and side effects on the other, the expedient solution was to unite a number of various homoeopathic single-remedy medications, homoeopathically adjusted allopathic medications (see below), intermediary catalysts (see below) and - in certain cases - suis-organ preparations (see below) within one single combination preparation. Through the multiplicity of constituents within Composita preparations, a broad, in-depth therapeutic effect is achieved. The basis for this are the various points of action at which the constituent medications develop their efficacy. The basic principle of the Composita preparations will be explained vicariously with the example of Euphorbium compositum Nasal Spray. This nasal spray preparation contains homoeopathic botanical constituents Euphorbium, Pulsatilla, and suis. The constituent \"Euphorbium,\" which lends its name to the preparation, demonstrates clear relations to illnesses of the upper respiratory tract in its drug picture. The organotropically implemented low potency of Euphorbium resinifera is Mercurius bijodatus, and Argentum nitricum, which contain in their remedy picture the symptomatology of catarrhal inflammatory processes of the upper respiratory tract according to the Materia Medica Homoeopathica. From a therapeutic viewpoint, the purpose of the Sinusitis-Nosode is to treat the illness underlying the chronic sinusitis etiologically (phase 3, deposition), which has settled in the area of the upper respiratory tract. It accomplishes this by reactivation based on the isopathic therapy principle through excretion via the excretion phase. The homoeopathically adjusted organ extract Mucosa nasalis suis basically acts on the mucous membrane region of the upper respiratory tract (homologous animal tissue; Schmid1), Reinhart2)). All of the applied active substances occur in potencies between D2 and D13, in other words, these are active substances in the so-called low potency and medium potency range; potencies of these ranges basically act organotropically and functiotropically according to the homoeopathic view. The therapy of chronic sinusitis is possible particularly through the nosode because nosode preparations exercise a positive effect especially on chronic processes and may reactivate them. In terms of anti-homotoxic therapy a chronic illness already in a matrix phase (phase 3 or 4) is re-activated in terms of a regressive vicariation according to Reckeweg and is returned to the inflammatory phase 2. The organotropically acting, classical and Luffa can then fully develop their efficacy in this activated inflammatory phase. Thus, this rational basic principle of uniting substances of diverse efficacies in one compositum preparation provides a new, therapeutically promising access to the treatment of chronic illnesses. The following reflections should elucidate this more closely: 1. Because chronic illnesses usually progress in syndromes and unite various causes into one diagnosable clinical syndrome, a medicinal therapy with the assistance of one single substance is seldom promising, as experience shows. By classifying the diagnosed disease into the Six-Phase-Table of Homotoxicology, the selection of the respective homoeopathic remedies for diseases of the matrix phase as well as of the degeneration and the dedifferentiation (neoplasm) phase, that is, basically for cellular diseases to the right of the Biological Division, need not be limited solely to the classical homoeopathic remedies from the botanical, mineral, and animal kingdoms. 2. In combination with nosode preparations, suis-organ constituents, and catalysts, the therapist gains the possibility to treat further progressed cellular phases to the right of the Biological Division, because, by removing the enzyme blockades though the catalysts or through an isotherapeutic \"massive nosode dose\" as well as through the suis-organ preparations, a regression of the disease in terms of regressive vicariation is activated. 3. As soon as a regressive vicariation into a humoral phase has taken place through the penetrating nosodes, catalysts, and suis-organ extracts, the organotropic, classical homoeopathic remedies can effectively induce the healing of the developing inflammatory phase. 4. The potency D8 of the organ constituent Mucosa nasalis lies in the so-called substitutive range. To this extent, this range is comparable to the organotropic range of the classical homoeopathic lower potencies (Schmid)1) and explains the direct action of these organ preparations on the homologous human tissue. With potencies up to the order of magnitude of approximately D12, a material action of these active substance molecules on endogenic function bearers such as enzymes, membrane receptors, and cellular structures of immunological cells or organ cells is still given, according to present conceptions, through the material presence of active substance molecules or their fragments (Heine).2) 5. Since, according to Paracelsus, every poison is its own antidote, the dose determines whether a substance has a poisonous or a healing effect for the patient. The potentised nosode can also be designated as its own antidote. The no-sode - in this case the sinusitis nosode - is extracted from a pathological secretion of a sinusitis patient. This effluence contains the complete information of the illness \"sinusitis.\" Through homoeopathic preparation and potent zing to D13 in the present case, a direct toxic effect is excluded, on the contrary, the specific antidote effect of the nosode in terms of the Arndt-Schulz inversion law is released through the potent zing. Moreover, potentised homoeopathic substances comply fully with the Arndt-Schulz law, which generally purports that weak stimuli, e.g., potentised homoeopathic substances, exercise a stimulative effect. This statement is basically supported by the modern hormesis research in toxicology, which demonstrates that a highly toxic substance such as mercuric salt, administered in the milligram range, exercises a strong toxic effect. However, after potent zing to D8 and higher, it demonstrates a stimulative effect which practically reverses the original toxic effect. The German pharmacologist Prof. Schulz was already able to repeatedly verify the \"bi-phasal\" effect of active substances in his experiments 100 years ago. This means that a substance in a certain dose range exercises a toxic effect and loses this toxic effect after further dilution (potent zing). After potent zing a new, therapeutically useful effect reveals itself which represents practically the opposite of the original toxic effect. Such reversals of effect and phasal effects of highly diluted toxins, e.g., anorganic salts from heavy metals and organic substances were also described by T.D. Luckey3) and E.J. Calabrese4) editors. Heavy metal - toxicity, safety and hormology. Stuttgart, New York, San Francisco, London, Georg-Thieme-Verlag, 1975; 81-103 (4) Calabrese, E. J. Biological Effects of Low Lever Exposures to Chemicals and Radiation; Lewis Publishers, Inc., Michigan, 1991 3.2 Single-constituent homoeopathic preparations Available both in Injeel (Injection-remedy Heel) and in single-potency form, these homoeopathic single-remedy agents may be subcutaneously injected, i.m., s.c., i.d. (segment therapy) or i.v. All single-constituent preparations and Injeels may also be administered orally in water or tea (see chapter C, section 2, page 439), an attribute particularly suitable for treatment of infants and small children. Each ampoule of an Injeel comprises several potencies of the same basic remedy in parallel existence to one another within a potency chord. The basic potency of an Injeel is generally D10 or D12, with equal parts of D30 and D200 as additional components. As a rule, Injeels of the \"forte\" type contain equal parts of (D4), D6, D12, D30, D200 and possibly D1000. With the administration of a potency chord the organism is addressed on several hierarchical levels, namely on the organotropic level by the low potency, on the functiotropic level by the medium potency, and on the \"informative\" or \"mental\" level with the assistance of the higher potency. Since, particularly during the course of regressive vicariations of chronic or severe illnesses of phases 4, 5 or even 6, considerable functional and informative errors occur in addition to the macroscopically detectable organic-structural errors, such potency chord preparations are also suited for the excretion of cellular illnesses due to the high potencies contained therein. The principle of the potency chord is that any adverse reaction which may occur upon application of lower potencies of a medicinal agent can be mitigated and reduced through the simultaneous administration of higher potencies of the same medication (high-potency inverse effect). As a rule, treatment should always commence with simultaneous application of single-remedy Injeels, catalysts, and specialized preparations. The forte forms are to be administered in treatment of acute disease and illnesses which have become organically detectable. 3.2.1 Classical homoeopathic remedies Anti-homotoxic medicine seldom requires - especially when the indication is obvious - homoeopathic single constituent remedies in single potencies. These single remedies are administered in terms of classical homoeopathy according to the simile principle. In anti-homotoxic medicine these single remedies are available as ampoules. Figure 7 shows an overview of the single remedies in single-potencies (ampoule form), which are available in addition to the single remedies in potency chords, nosodes, suis-organ preparations, etc. Fig. 7: List preparations are employed for the purpose of rectifying iatrogenic damage (Isopathic principle). Here, high attenuations of the therapeutic agent which caused the iatrogenic damage are administered as a restorative antidote against the therapeutic damage sustained (Isotherapeutic Principle). The terminology of these homoeopathically adjusted allopathic medications corresponds to their generic designations. Homoeopathically-prepared allopathic medication is applied in accordance with the \"Simile Principle\": The receptors of the Great Defensive System are already occupied by the damage-evoking preparation and can no longer respond to medications according to the \"Principle of Sameness.\" According to the Law of Similars (Rule of Similarity), additional resistance mechanisms, similar to the anti-homotoxic agent (= similimum) which had been in reserve to that point, are activated through these adjusted drugs. In addition to administering the homoeopathically-processed form of the precise drug which initiated the iatrogenic damage, it is advisable to apply further, similar, active substances as well. Should damage due to penicillin (for example) fail to be counteracted by Penicillin-Injeel, an attempt utilizing Streptomycin-Injeel or Sulfonamid-Injeel is advisable. Fig. 8: List of homoeopathically adjusted allopathic Acetylsalicyls\u00e4ure-Injeel und use of catalysts of the intermediary metabolism is a specialty of the anti-homotoxic therapy. The substances designated as intermediary catalysts are physiological constituents of cellular respiration and energy production (citric acid cycle, redox systems). In part these are also substances which are formed during other enzymatic conver-sions and/or are catalytically effective in these processes. Damage to enzyme systems is frequently of iatrogenic nature because many conventional pharmaceutical medications are based on the inhibition of enzymes as the active principle. Enzymes especially are impeded in their activity by increasing environmental stress (e.g., by heavy metals or pesticides). Due to the deficiency of enzyme function a backup of metabolites present before the respective enzymatic reaction occurs as well as a lack of substrates to be metabolized after this reaction. The administration of the corresponding catalysts in homoeopathic preparations is based upon the concept that the metabolic process is activated and that blocked cell or enzyme functions are reactivated. Since enzyme damage expresses itself as chronic and/or degenerative diseases, the application of catalysts is therefore primarily indicated for such diseases. Catalysts are substances which accelerate the equilibration of chemical reactions without disturbing the balance of the process themselves. The extent to which a catalyst is able to accelerate a reaction is impressive. An increase of the reaction speed by six decimal powers is not uncommon, since one single enzyme molecule is often capable of converting more than 10,000 substrate molecules per second. At the end of a reaction the catalyst remains unchanged and is again available to immediately catalyse the same reaction on the next molecule. The described process is designated as catalysis. When the reactions occur in bio-systems, they are referred to as \"bio-catalysts.\" The catalysis may be additionally increased by activators, but it also may be reduced or blocked by \"poisons\" (homotoxins). The citric acid cycle is the \"turntable of metabolism,\" which represents the principal path of the catabolic metabolism of the pyruvate and/or the acetyl co-enzyme A. It is a basic, closed, reaction path present in humans, animals, and plants; the cleavage products of the carbohydrate metabolism, the oxidative carbohydrate metabolism, the oxidative decomposition of fatty acids and - after transamination - the cleavage products from the protein metabolism as well all end in it. Furthermore, it supplies important elements for synthesis of the organism. In conjunction with the respiratory chain the citric acid cycle is simultaneously the most significant source of energy for the metabolic process. It supplies the hydrogen for the biological oxidation and is thus closely linked to the energy metabolism of the cells. The elements of the citric acid cycle are oxalaceticum (oxalo-acetic sodium). The transformation of one carboxylic acid into the next within the citric acid cycle is mediated by enzymes. The involved enzymes may be inhibited conditionally by noxae (e. g., competitive inhibition, final product inhibition, substrate inhibition), which can lead to concentration variations of single acids of the citric acid cycle. This can in turn trigger reactions or blockades with consecutive symptoms or disease manifestations in various tissues. It must be taken into consideration that catalysts can only act when the milieu is correct. In control systems and metabolic chains not only the hydrogen ion concentration (pH-value) is involved, but the corresponding substrates and \"co-factors\" must also be available. The co-factors include vitamins and trace elements, including certain metal ions. Some catalysts have to be activated first by these co-factors to render them functionable. Metal enzyme complexes are frequently referred to as metallo-enzymes. Some of these metal ions are \"two-faced\" and while enabling the catalysis in small doses, in larger doses they may inhibit or block functions. For therapeutic application, the term \"catalyst\" is more broadly defined than in physiological contexts; it includes catalysts in a strict sense (enzymes) as well as the respective substrates, intermediary products, and co-factors. The available preparations may be classified into three groups: Group A: Acids of the citric-acid cycle and their salts. Group B: Quinones and their derivatives as well as other intermediary respiratory catalysts. Group C: Compounds which effect stimulation: biogenic amines, hormones, elements (cerium), botanical extracts (anthocyanins). General recommendations The implementation of bio-catalysts has a strong stimulative effect on patients (e. g., severe tiredness after administration of the remedy). It is recommended to drink at least 2 to 3 liters during the first three days of treatment and to extense refrain from physical activities as well. In addition a low toxin diet is desirable. Signs of a regressive vicariation should not be suppressed but rather excreted through the assistance of biological therapeutic remedies. Exact timing is of the greatest importance for the implementation of catalysts. False timing may trigger progressive vicariations in some cases. This phenomenon occurs when the body is in an extremely unstable condition or is too weak to be subjected to a stimulation therapy. It must be particularly ensured with patients in a weakened condition that the treatment is very slowly commenced and is not applied with massive doses of remedies. Example: Begin with 1/2 ampoule orally 2x weekly or 2x weekly dissolve 1 ampoule in 1 1/2 liters of water and drink this solution in small sips throughout the day. The bio-catalysts frequently achieve the desired effect without the occurrence of severe healing crises. For all catalyst preparations of Group B, a repetition of injections should only be conducted after subsidence of the possible occurrence of initial aggravation and always when complaints recur. Furthermore, a proper drainage is important, that is, for patients with severe toxic affliction, the endogenic defence system should be mobilized before the therapy with catalysts. Three phases of the bio-regulation therapy can generally be distinguished: 1. Stabilization of the disease process, that is, treatment of possible inflammatory processes, whereby, in certain cases, the conventional therapy may not be dis- continued immediately. A stabilization can be achieved through a diet, sensible life style, sufficient exercise, support of the endogenic defence system, etc. 2. Supplementation of deficient substances, including vitamins and trace elements, as well as the treatment of present dysbiosis. A weakened organism with severe deficiencies and dysbiosis must be treated first with parenteral vitamin pre- parations. With regard to mineral and trace elements, particularly zinc, calcium, potassium, and magnesium are important. 3. Surgical treatment; removal of inflammation centres: e.g., tooth extraction, sanitation of the paranal sinus, removal of amalgam, etc. 3.2.3.1 Group A catalysts Acids of the citric acid cycle and/or their salts General information Control systems and metabolic chains can only fulfil their function when all links of the chain are intact; this means for physiological processes that the initial substrate, enzymes, and intermediary products must be adjusted to each other for the individual metabolic process steps (e.g., citric acid cycle). Functional disorders can be generated in the material or dynamic area; the consequences are always reciprocal. The following constellations result there from: a) The initial substrate is quantitatively insufficient or qualitatively altered. Based on the Michaelis Menten relation of the dependency of the catalytic reaction on the available substrate, a dysregulation is given at the initial step. b) An insufficient quantity of the enzyme is available or it is completely lacking. The metabolic process is impeded or obstructed at this point. The product to be catalysed is either insufficiently or not formed at all - the metabolic process chain is weakened or interrupted. These basic processes occur at many points in metabolic process chains. The cited performance of the chain is always determined by the weakest link - substrate, enzyme, or intermediary product. Due to the situation that, after every enzymatic dysfunction, the subsequent product to be catalysed is no longer sufficiently formed, the intermediary products play an essential role in the further course of the chain reaction. Therefore, during therapy, enzymatic defects should not only be affected with the lacking or deficient enzyme - when at all possible - but should also be specifically treated with the intermediary products behind the enzyme obstruction. Several enzyme reactions require magnesium or manganese ions as additional activators. Thus, all kinase reactions require magnesium ions for the phosphate transfer, whereas alkaline phosphatases are by magnesium and manganese ions by manganese. In many the magnesium ions can be replaced by manganese ions when necessary. Thus, it makes sense and is understandable that specific therapy with the intermediary catalysts of the citric acid cycle is initiated or combined with an injection of magnesium and manganese ions as phosphate compounds due to the significance of the anorganic phosphate. Fields of application All diseases classified as cellular phases (degeneration phases, dedifferentiation phases) and which are consequently characterized by defective enzymatic control, blockages and/or defective liver and injurious nephrosis and angina pectoris, treatment subsequent to myocardial infarction, arteriosclerosis, cerebral sclerosis Dysfunction and dysregulation of endocrine diabetes mellitus, dysthyroidism Precancerous and dedifferentiation phases (previously: neoplasm phases) within any tissue whatsoever During and ensuing X-ray and radioactive exposure (several enzymes, e.g., the maleate dehydrogenase, are sensitive to radiation) Thrombocytopenia, leucopenia Dosage Most expedient is the injection of the individual acids of the citric acid cycle and/or their salts in the sequence in which they are generated within the cell during the course of metabolism to reach all possibly existing defects, obstructions, and instances of faulty regulation. It is advisable in such therapy to inject two to three acids (and/or their salts) simultaneously in the form of a combination injection. For reasons of practicality, these injections are best applied either s.c. or i.m. As magnesium and manganese ions activate a number of enzymatic processes - the kinase reactions in particular, during which phosphate transfer occurs (see subsection 3.2.3.1 General Information) - the Magnesium-Manganum-phosphoricum-Injeel included in the combination pack is to be administered with the initial (combined) injection. The injections are generally applied 1-2x weekly. Upon completion of a series - i.e., after 4 combination injections (see below) - catalyst therapy may possibly require interpolation by a treatment-free interval of 2 to 4 weeks until the injections' effects have subsided. During this period, however, the indicated anti-homotoxic preparations (Injeels, Homaccords, and other Heel combination preparations, as well as suis-organ preparations and nosodes) are to be applied. Indeed these may also be employed in conjunction with the acids/salts of the citric acid cycle even during the injection period. During the intake of a homoeopathic remedy present symptoms may be temporarily aggravated (initial aggravation). The patient is advised to consult his/her therapist. Plan of subcutaneous injections Injection 1: Magnesium-Manganum-phosphoricum-Injeel + Natrium DL-malicum-Injeel After an application-free interval of 2 to 4 weeks, repetition of this series of injections. Each acid and/or its salt may be injected separately and repetitively in the Injeel-forte form as well. This is indicated primarily when a particularly effective action during one of the combined injections listed above (1 to 4) was achieved. The ampoules contained in this combination should subsequently be applied individually. The diet should include ample fresh fruit, grape juice, bilberries, and beet root. The latter are rich in anthocyanins (activators of cellular respiration, hydrogen acceptors); also refer to intermediary catalysts, Group C: Myrtillus, Beta vulgaris rubra! Package sizes Packages containing 5, 10, 50 and 100 ampoules of 1,1 ml each. Citric-Acid-Cycle combination pack (contains 9 ampoules of single constituent Injeels + 1 ampoule Magnesium Manganum-phosphoricum-Injeel). List of group A catalysts The Injeel preparations contain the following potency chord forte preparations in all Quinones as well as other intermediary respiratory catalysts General information Organic compounds which contain one or several carbonyl groups (> C=O) play an important role in electron transfer processes such as cellular respiration and redox reactions without direct O2-involvement. These compounds include quinones, hydroquinones, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. Electron transfers which involve oxygen contain radical intermediates. Radicals can counteract condensation processes as they occur in the impregnation, degeneration, and dedifferentiation (neoplasm) phases in particular. Free radicals are short-lived, highly reactive products of metabolism which contain one or more unpaired electrons (molecules, atoms, and ions). In the 1930s William Koch introduced free radicals and the catalytic effects into medicinal research and employed them successfully for the healing of diverse diseases. At that time, the knowledge of the existence of free radicals was developed based on his research. The quinones possess the special ability to neutralize oxygen radicals. A quinone therapy improves the cellular respiration (biological oxidation). Toxins which must be removed during the course of a lifetime can be decomposed by oxidation as well. Oxidation signifies the consumption of oxygen and subsequently, the existence of risk of an inefficient metabolism. It is possible to treat the consequences of a faulty regulation with quinones. Quinone therapy sets high standards on the toxic defence system of the organism. The support of the toxin defence system and a deliberate excretion therapy are important. Bonded amino groups can be transferred to carbonyl groups by transamination and are thus mobilized. The quinones and methylene blue have certain characteristics in common. For example, both possess the capability of representing the enzyme succino-dehydrogenase (dehydrogenation of succinic acid into fumaric acid) under anaerobic conditions. Without oxygen, methylene blue can serve in place of this enzyme as an electron acceptor. Fields of application The preparations within Group B are to be applied preferably for clinical syndromes and/or cellular phases to the right of the Biological Division, i.e., for impregnation, degeneration, and dedifferentiation phases (previously: neoplasm phases). Dosage Dosage must always be determined on an individual basis, depending on each patient's findings, state of health, and individual response to these preparations, which can vary considerably from case to case - even in instances of identical diagnosis! It is generally advisable to apply the catalyst preparations of Group B once, perhaps twice, weekly (i.m., s.c., i.c.; when required also in the corresponding acupuncture points and possibly i.v.). We wish to point out that, as with the nosodes, catalyst preparations from Group B may also be advantageously employed in the therapy of cellular phases by administering them in conjunction with those preparations required otherwise. Special therapeutic stipulations a) As a rule, Glyoxal and Methylglyoxal should be applied relatively seldom. For this reason, these two preparations should always be allotted an extensive period of time in which to expend their after-effects. b) In cases requiring the use of para-benzoquinone, it is advisable to precede such treatment with approximately 3 applications of hydroquinone c) Quinhydrone should be coupled with a homoeopathic metal preparation, e.g., with Aurum-Injeel, Argentum-Injeel, or Ferrum metallicum-Injeel. Package sizes Packages containing 5, 10, 50 and 100 ampoules 1,1 ml each. List of group B catalysts The Injeel preparations contain the following potency chord in preparations: D12, D30, D200 0.367 ml each. The Injeel-forte preparations chord in all Group C catalysts Other compounds with stimulative action General Information Other compounds with stimulative action and catalytic effects on metabolic and respiratory functions include: Homoeopathically prepared vitamins of the vitamin B-group as well as of vitamin A and vitamin C (in lowest potency D6, respectively) - as co-factors and/or co-enzymes; compounds with other stimulative and catalytic effects, e.g., biogenic amines such as adrenaline, serotonine (5-hydroxi-tryptamine) and histamine (4-(2'-aminoethyl)-imidazol) and/or their precursors such as the amino acids tryptophane (b-indolalanine = precursor of serotonine) and histidine (b-imidazolalanine and/or b-imidazolylalanine = precursor of histamine) as well the amino cysteine (contains sulphur), Acidum L(+) asparagicum tryptophane indole and scatole (b-methylindole) and the amino acid derivatives guanidine (Imino-urea) and methylguanidine as well as anthozyanins (activators of cell respiration; hydrogen acceptors) and elements (trace element factors), e.g., cesium and cerium (redox catalytic action). Dosage Generally, injections are administered 1-2x weekly. The injection of one or several catalysts is only repeated after the effect of the previous injection has subsided. As the healing consolidates injections are generally more seldom required. Package sizes Packages containing 5, 10, 50 and 100 ampoules 1,1 ml each.

We differentiate between auto-nosode preparations and hetero-nosode preparations. Auto-nosode preparations These are substances gained from the patient's own organism such as blood, urine, lachrymal fluid, sputum, pus, stools, or diseased tissue. The initial substances are homoeopathically adjusted and applied to the same patient. Hetero-nosode preparations These are substances which do not originate from the own organism. There are: 1. Viral nosode preparations e.g. Streptococcinum 3. Vaccine-nosode preparations e.g. (from microorganisms Influenza nosode or vaccines) Rabies vaccine Rubeola vaccine 4. Tissue nosodes (from e.g. pathologically altered organs Gastritis-Nosode and/or tissues and products Tonsillitis-Nosode of metabolism including Sinusitis-Nosode body secretions) Mastopathia cystica-Nosode Source material Nosodes are preparations produced according to a homoeopathic processing technique from pathologically altered organs or organic constituents of human or animal origin, further, from non-living cultures of micro-organisms, decomposition products of animal origin, or from bodily fluids containing pathogens or pathological products, e.g., liquor, or puncture liquid. The identity of the source material is verified by a protocol of the specialist's findings of the operation material or laboratory results and, when required, by certificates of the suppliers of the bacteria and viruses. The HAB (German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia) stipulates that the base material for nosode preparations is first sterilized and that it afterwards complies with the sterility control pursuant to the German Pharmacopoeia (DAB 10). The homoeopathic processing is only conducted upon completion of these prerequisites. Nosode preparations are, therefore, neither vaccines, nor sera, nor other such agents; they are remedies exclusively and purely of a homoeopathic nature. Mother tinctures are manufactured from this source material according to regulations 43 or 44. The definition of the nosode preparations conforms to the definition of material stipulated in \u00a7 3 of the German Drug Law, particularly in items 3 and 4. Thus substances within the meaning of the law are: 1. Chemical elements 2. Plants and botanical components 3. Bodies of animals, including those of living animals as well as body parts, com- ponents thereof and metabolic products of human or animal origin in a proces- sed state 4. Microorganisms including viruses as well as their components or metabolic products There are two different directives for the production of nosode preparations, namely the HAB 1 (German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia) specification 43 for mother tinctures from pathologically altered organs or organic components of human or animal origin and specification 44 for mother tinctures from non-living cultures of microorganisms or from decomposition products of animal organs or from bodily fluids containing pathogens or pathological products. The following examples illustrate the production of nosode preparations: Viral nosode preparations Coxsackie-Virus-B4-Nosode This is produced from dead Coxsackie-B4 viruses adjusted to 109 plaque-forming units per milliliter. Herpes Zoster-Nosode This is produced from dead Herpes-Zoster viruses adjusted to 106 plaque-forming units per milliliter. Bacterial nosode preparations Bacterium coli-Nosode This is a preparation produced from Escherichia-coli bacteria cultures adjusted to a specific titer (107 KBE/g). Bacterium lactis aerogenes-Nosode This is a nosode preparation produced from an Enterobacter-aerogenes bacteria culture (107 KBE/g). Tissue nosodes Tonsillitis-Nosode This from surgically removed inflamed tonsils (Tonsilla palatina). Gastritis-Nosode This is produced from gastric mucous removed surgically from a gastritis patient. Sinusitis-Nosode This is a mucous mass gained from inflamed sinuses. Otitis media-Nosode The source material is pus from patients suffering from a middle ear infection. General application information Nosode preparations are applied according to the a. symptomatic/anamnestic similarity (simile principle) and b. applied at the end and/or after a previously overcome acute illness. The following remarks refer to the above items: To a. The application of the nosode preparations should be administered according to the symptomatic similarity, that on the basis of the fundamental homoeopathic rules of similitude and/or according to the anamnestic etiological similarity to a past illness which has apparently since been cured. The preparation Diphtheria-Nosode ( Diphtherinum-Injeel and forte), for example, is not employed primo loco in treatment of acute diphtheria - which would correspond to a similarity to a developing acute infection - but rather for the treatment of cardiac diseases displaying similar symptoms as are present in a heart damaged by diphtheria (= symptomatic similarity) and/or for the treatment of heart-disease patients whose case history includes diphtheria (= anamnestic etiological similarity). The following is important when employing nosode preparations under the aspect of current etiological similarities: All nosodes may be used specifically, i.e., as isotherapeutic agents of the corresponding affections from which they were developed. Generally, they are administered in this case as an intermediary remedy in addition to the indicated homoeopathic remedies, whereby particularly excretive, matrix-channeling anti-homotoxic remedies, (e.g. Lymphomyosot , Galium-Heel ), play an important role. To b. After the disease has been overcome, nosodes are excellent to induce the toxins deposited in the matrix to be excreted more rapidly. Quite frequently, the toxins removed through this technique are not the sole causative agents but also remnant deposits of contagion with latent pathogenic foci as well as colonies of agents which are no longer pathogenic (sources of continuous exudation). This applies particularly with regards to the infectious diseases such as measles, rubella, varicella, influenza, erysipelas, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, diphtheria etc. It can also be assumed that the specific defence processes against the pathogens are reinduced by the nosode preparations. The clinical confirmation of this immuno-modulative effect is found in the regression of currently forced antibody formations as the expression of the incomplete toxin release of the pathogens. Thus the normalization of a pathologically increased antistreptolysin titer is frequently observed after the application of the streptococcus nosode. Indications for a nosode therapy 1. Chronically exudative diseases 2. Chronically proliferative diseases 3. Degenerative diseases 4. Auto-aggression diseases (Caution!) 5. Iatrogenic damages Nosodes may be designated as terrain remedies. Therefore, they are particularly indicated for the treatment of dyscrasia, i.e., constitutional diseases and/or summation states of integrating and/or integrated dispositions. In terms of Homotoxicology, they are useful for cellular phases, especially for re-toxically inhibited phases, for the treatment of auto-aggression diseases (Caution!), of psoric diseases according to Hahnemann, as well as allergies. Auto-aggression diseases should only be treated after corresponding pre-treatment, such as excretion therapies with matrix-channeling anti-homotoxic remedies. Nosodes are not only indicated however for cellular phases but also frequently for humoral phases, particularly when a dyscrasic component is involved or complications threaten to arise or in case of reduced immunopotency. The effect of nosodes results in terms of a positive vicariation in detoxification and excretion of homotoxins. This signifies simultaneously an increase of the self-healing processes controlled by the defence system. In most cases a summation of known and possibly unknown poisonous substances (homotoxins) is to be assumed, and based on this knowledge is also the necessity and justification of a simultaneous application of a series of nosodes (e.g., Diphtherinum + Psorinum + Medorrhinum), which are to be applied possibly in conjunction with other single-constituent Injeels, combination preparations etc. as a broad spectrum anti-homotoxic remedy in order to cleanse the cited terrain. Psorinoheel N (drops, ampoules) is, for example, such a broad spectrum nosode preparation which also contains, aside from the two Psora-nosode preparations (Psorinum and Medorrhinum), vaccininum and bacillinum, furthermore two constitution remedies (sulphur and thuja) and a series of additional homoeopathic remedies. This combination preparation is primarily indicated for the phases of the constitution, i.e., for the cellular phases, as well as for the disposition phases or humoral phases. In case of unclear clinical syndromes and/or clinical syndromes which cannot be immediately clarified, with regard to the anamnestic etiological similarity as well as with regard to the symptomatic similarity, it is frequently advisable to include such a combination preparation based on nosodes in the therapy plan particularly for the cellular phases. Nosodes exercise a profound constitutional effect. Virtually every type of therapy can be effectively reinforced with nosode preparations. They frequently fulfil the role of a missing link in a chain of therapeutic reactions, whereby cure without nosodes is inconclusive or can only be achieved with extreme difficulty. The effect occurs thereby via subliminal antigen-antibody-reactions as well as via the homoeopathic counteracting mechanism of co-repressors. Dosage As a matter of principle, dosage is always to be determined strictly on an individual basis, depending upon each patient's findings, state of health and particular response to each of the nosode preparations, all of which can vary considerably from case to case. In general, dosage consists of 1 ampoule, administered 1 to a maximum of 3x weekly. The duration of therapy with nosode preparations is also to be determined individually, and is to be adjusted in keeping with each given case. A brief interval of treatment (approximately 2 - 4 weeks) is recommended when applied in the aftermath of an acute affection, whereas chronic disorders should receive therapy over a relatively extensive period (approximately 6 months) depending upon the individual reactive condition of each patient. It is recommended to begin nosode therapy with the normal Injeel form, later adopting application of the forte form, particularly when the corresponding reactions or improvements should fail to materialize as anticipated. In the event the Injeel-forte form should also fall short of achieving the desired therapeutic success, low single potencies are then to be applied. For example, Anthracinum-Injeel in single potency D10 is several potencies lower than the potency chord D20, D30, Bacterium coli in D5 is one potency lower than Bacterium coli-Injeel forte, which applies for several other \"bacterial\" nosode preparations, e.g., also for Bacterium lactis aerogenes, Bacterium pyocyaneus, and Brucella abortus Bang. Higher potencies (single higher potencies) should only be employed when excessive reactions occur to the normal Injeel form of the corresponding nosode preparations. Thus, Variolinum in single potency D200 and/or D1000 and/or Vaccininum in single potency D200 employed when excessive D200) and/or to Vaccininum-Injeel (D20, D30, D200) occur once. The following rule for treatment in general is particularly true in regard to nosode therapy: The higher potencies (D12, D30, etc.) are indicated for treating: increased irritability (Arsenic, Phosphate, Iodine or Chamomile Type) diathesis allergy and chronic disorders The lower potencies (approximately D6/D8 and lower) are indicated in treatment of affections which are more or less acute: slow-reacting types of individuals (Sepia, Nux-vomica, Graphites, Silicea types) when organotropic action on a specific organ is desired (e.g., the tonsils: Ton- sillarpfr\u00f6pfe-Injeel forte and/or D10, D30 and D200). Indications for higher potencies generally require relatively lengthy intervals of up to several weeks' duration between applications. Conversely, indications for lower potencies usually require only brief periods between applications, approximately 3 doses per week. The recommended procedure is to commence administration by means of i.m., s.c. or i.d. injection (neural and/or acupuncture points); only in the event that this mode of application fails to evoke response may the corresponding nosode be administered i.v. in appropriate cases. The application of the nosode Injeels during a progressive auto-sanguis therapy is advantageous. The nosodes should however always be applied during the last stage. Note on dosage and potentization of nosodes in therapy of children No essential difference exists between the dosage of nosode preparations and that of other homoeopathic agents in treating young patients, i.e., children receive a (somewhat) smaller dose than the adult patients. Dosage (per application) for children: 0- 1 years of age approximately 0,3 ml 1- 6 years of age approximately 0,5 ml 6-12 years of age approximately 0,6 ml > 12 adult dosage For children, the lower potencies of D4 - D8 are administered at the beginning of therapy as well as in treatment of affections which are more or less acute; thus the same procedures are followed as for adults. Likewise, the higher potencies (approximately D12 - D30) are used in both child and adult patients ensuing initial treatment with lower potencies (D4 - D8) and/or for therapy of chronic affections. Thus the same particulars apply for children in regard to potentization as they do in treatment of adults. General In their capacity as \"terrain remedies,\" nosodes provide effective reinforcement for virtually every type of therapy. Nosodes frequently fulfil the role of a missing link in a series or chain of therapeutic reactions, whereby cure without the nosode is inconclusive or can be attained only under extreme difficulty. From a homotoxicological aspect, nosodes are chiefly applied in order to transform cellular phases into humoral phases, i.e., in order to achieve regressive vicariation. Nosodes are indicated in treatment of humoral phases as well, especially in cases which are in jeopardy of lapsing into a chronic condition such as in which there is impending danger of progressive vicariation. Therapists working in the field of electro-acupuncture find the use of nosodes especially interesting due to the capabilities of such specialists to precisely determine the corresponding nosodes through the technique of medicinal testing. Thus therapy with nosodes is exceptionally effective in combining \"apparatus medicine\" by means of the above-mentioned medicinal testing (bioelectric technique of drug determination), where appropriate, with the therapist's \"eye for clinical diagnosis\" or \"visual diagnosis.\" Here, as always, the nosodes are to be administered according to symptomatic similarity, i.e., on the basis of the fundamental homoeopathic rules of similitude and employing the \"diagnostic aid\" provided by the anamnesis, whereby any anamnestic, etiological similarity to a past, apparently cured illness is also taken into consideration. One should bear in mind in this respect that the extraordinarily good diagnostician and the excellent therapist is often recognizable by his or her ability to compile a skilful and accurate anamnesis.

An important component of anti-homotoxic therapy is the suis-organ preparation. These are preferably employed for chronic courses of diseases in the cellular phases. Subsequently, they offer an excellent possibility for the reactivation of organ functions, particularly of elderly patients. The preparations are employed according to the simile principle, that is, the respective preparation of the organ to be treated is applied. Suis-organ preparations contain organic tissues which have been homoeopathically processed, i.e., attenuated and potentized in accordance with Specification 42 of the official German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia 1978 (HAB 1) whose primary materials originate from healthy swine. In accordance with their action, the suis-organ preparations can be characterized as organ-specific medications with stimulative properties. The mechanism through which the suis-organ preparations function is based on the organotropic effects of the substances and/or stimulants contained therein. Keeping of the donor animals and organ acquisition The following provides detailed information on the rearing and keeping of swine for the purpose of gaining suis-organ preparations: All swine designated for utilization in gaining organ extracts are descendants from the same breeding line, bred in an operation certified for keeping SPF (\"specifically pathogen free\") livestock. This operation is monitored at six-week intervals by the governmental veterinary health service having jurisdiction. At a suitable age, the piglets are transferred and raised in a different agricultural facility. On delivery to this rearing operation, an initial examination is performed by the livestock veterinarian, ensuing passage of which the animals are kept separate from other animals, under veterinary surveillance. Animals requiring medicinal treatment due to any affection are excluded from organ extraction. The animals are given vegetable feed produced on the operation's own premises. Both operational proprietors have agreed by contract to utilize neither animal meals from mammals, nor waste materials as feed. Upon attaining slaughtering weight and passing release-control by the jurisdictional public veterinarian, the swine are transported to the nearest abattoir, which must possess E.E.C. status. In accordance with regulations for meat hygiene, a live examination of the donor animals is then carried out, as well as meat inspection ensuing slaughter. In all meats attaining the rating \"suitable for human consumption,\" samples are drawn for the following additional tests: bacteriological inspection, a test for inhibitory substances, as well as serological analysis for brucellosis, leptospirosis, and yersiniosis in accordance with the Zoonosis Recommendations (July 8, 1991) of the German Federal Ministry of Health. Removal of the required organs is subsequently performed in an area entirely separate from the remainder of the abattoir, which is utilized exclusively for this purpose. The organs obtained in this manner remain under quarantine until all examination findings have been determined. Only then are the extracted organs released for further processing by the quality control department of the Heel company. The organ preparations are first processed by means of potentization, after which sterilization is then carried out. In this manner, the material preserves the character of the living tissue during potentization; also the preparations thus maintain a direct protein correlation with the affected organ. The measures presented here, all of which are additionally documented by means of official veterinary reports, serve to fulfill one objective: to ensure the highest feasible standard of medicinal safety (zoonosis) for the suis-organ preparations. The swine as a donor animal The human organism and that of swine demonstrate numerous similarities in the aspects of chemical and biological constitution, thus a situation of homoeopathic similitude exists. The morphological and other biological similarities between the organisms of man and pig have been the topic of repeated reports during the past several decades. An overview of the factors which man and pig have in common as compiled by Kirkman is provided below (Kirkman, R. L. (1989): \"Of Swine and Man: Organ Physiology in Different Species\" In: Hardy, M.A. (ed.): Xenograft 25. Elsevier, Amsterdam and others). Similar characteristics of man and swine (according to Kirkman, 1989): 1. Size 2. Dietary habits: omnivorous 3. Digestive physiology 4. Nephritic structure and function 5. Rate and volume of respiration 6. Location of the coronary arteries 7. Hemodynamics 8. Tendency to create fat deposits 9. Highly susceptible to disease 10. Social behaviour From the homoeopathic point of view, therefore, despite the difference in species, an organ preparation acquired from swine and subsequently processed in accordance with homoeopathic techniques may be deemed a simile to the homologous human organs due to the numerous existing functional and structural similarities. As Reckeweg observed, it is on the grounds of these similarities that organ remedies obtained from swine possess greater efficacy than such derived from cattle or sheep. Suis-organ preparations: fields of application The suis-organ preparations are employed in treatment of the homologous human organs. The Commission D, the committee in the German Federal Ministry of Health concerned with medicinal processing with jurisdiction over homoeopathy, included the following excerpt in their definition of characteristics for organ preparations manufactured in accordance with the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia, HAB 1: \"Homoeopathically-processed organ preparations are applied on the concept that insufficiency or disturbance of the homologous target-organ in humans shall receive succor through the corresponding organ-medication.\" Further, the applicational fields are designated by this commission as \"supportive therapy in cases of insufficiency or disturbance of the homologous human organ.\" The suis-organ preparations are indicated particularly, and primarily, in treatment of cellular phases, especially for chronic affections (i.e., the phases of impregnation, degeneration, and dedifferentiation). Yet these remedies may certainly also find application in phases located to the left of the biological division, e.g., in therapy of pathologically disturbed excretion phases (hyperhidrosis, dysmenorrhea, constipation, eliminatory weakness of the kidneys, etc.) One should also bear in mind that therapy with suis-organ preparations is indicated in treatment of numerous deposition phases as well, such as rheumatic diseases, myomas, adiposis, calculi, and the like. Dosage and modes of administration The following table presents a general therapeutic plan for the application of suis-organ preparations in treatment of chronic and/or degenerative organic damage. Fig. 9Approx. Periodes Therapeutic Measure 3-4 weeks Preliminary treatment 1-2 x weekly 8i.m.; s.c., i.d., at acupuncture points, orally or as progressive auto-sanguis therapy; initially in injeel form, after 6-8 injections in injeel-forte form) conjointly with the individually appropriate antihomotoxic remedies. 3-4 weeks Suis-organ preparations discontinued. adjuvant anti- homotoxic medication continued alone. Second injection-series with suis-organ preparations as r e q u i r e d . Upon achieving clinical cure, possible reapplication of organ preparations every 2-3 weeks. As indicated in the above table, after four to five weeks' administration of the suis organ preparations in Injeel form, the Injeel forte form is applied i.m. or s.c. on a trial basis, as a type of test ampoule in order to determine the degree in which the affected organ's functional regeneration has progressed; i.e., whether the healing process has become largely established at that point in therapy or not. In treating severe degenerative phases as well as in therapeutic attempts for dedifferentiation phases more frequent injections may be required (every 2 - 3 days) in addition to the support of agents which foster and promote regressive vicariation ( Galium-Heel , Engystol N , Traumeel S ). This is performed most conveniently by means of combination injections. Also frequently expedient are such combination injections utilizing the organotherapeutically-indicated biotherapeutic remedy appropriate in each case (e.g., in conjunction with Hepeel ). It often occurs that several suis-organ preparations are indicated in a single patient. This is best performed by syringe, either simultaneously by means of a combination injection, or injected periodically in alternation. Application of suis-organ preparations through i.v. injection should be initially exercised with restraint. This mode of administration is to be employed only ensuing comparatively lengthy i.m., s.c. or i.d. injection (see above!). Prior to using the organotherapeutically indicated suis-organ preparation, it is advisable in many cases to apply the corresponding, functionally underlying suis-organ preparation with toxic cleansing (=channeling) action for a period of 2 to 3 weeks, i.e., for the treatment of hepatic disorders, Vesica fellea suis prior as well as Pyelon suis prior to Ren suis etc. In case of severe toxic affliction, the most expedient procedure is to precede usage of the specially indicated suis-organ preparation with application of the organ preparation Colon suis D10, D30, D200 (1-2x weekly i.m. or s.c. for 2 to 3 weeks). Colon suis is beneficial here as it supports and normalizes the eliminatory function of the intestine. Employment of suis-organ preparations in progressive auto-sanguis therapy This is appropriate, for example, in treating iatrogenic damage, toxic hepatic damage, migraine, chronic eczema, bronchial asthma, duodenal and ventricular ulcers, arthrosis, as well as lymphatism. See also the related data on hyperimmunization-therapy employing suis-organ preparations (page 44). Applicational restrictions Since immunological mechanisms are stimulated through the suis-organ preparations, a stimulative action of the suis-organ preparations is frequently no longer expected in cases of pronounced cachexia and/or marasmus. On the other hand, a possibly occurring focal reaction during the degradation of damaged cells can endanger cachectic and marantic patients in certain circumstances. Forms in which suis-organ preparations are supplied For parenteral (and possibly oral; see point 4!) organotherapy, the suis-organ preparations are available in ampoules of 1.1 ml as potency chords in two degrees of strength: as the potency chord D10, D30, and D200, and the D8, D12, D30, and D200. A available as single potencies D6 and D200; these are also supplied in ampoules of 1,1 ml. each. Constituents In order to conserve space, the entries below have been presented in condensed form. Both degrees of strength - identified in each case through the corresponding addendum \"Injeel\" or \"Injeel forte\" - contain potency as indicated Example: Aorta suis-Injeel 1,1 ml D10, Arteria suis D30, A r t e r i a s u i s D 2 0 0 Arteria suis-Injeel forte 1,1 ml injection preparations are formulated in the same general pattern as illustrated here. Prescriptions should always bear the precise designation \"Injeel\" or \"Injeel forte\" in order to facilitate acquisition of the proper medication through the chemist and wholesaler.

The \"International Society of Homotoxicology\" is an association of registered medical physicians from every field of human medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and pharmacists. The \"International Society of Homotoxicology\" was founded on the 24th of June 1961 in Baden-Baden, where it has since maintained its seat. Its founder was the German physician Dr. H.H. Reckeweg, who wrote the fundamental work \"Homotoxicology - A Holistic Approach to the Synthesis of Medicine\" (1955). In the hospital, the clinic, and the medical practice as well, his Homotoxicology has proven to be a truly valuable therapeutic concept. The Society is dedicated to the advancement and cultivation of the teachings of Homotoxicology and the promotion of homotoxicological research on a national and international scale. For this purpose, the \"Academy for Homotoxicology and Anti-homotoxic Therapy\" was founded in 1992. Its principal function is the conduction of seminars for further and supplementary medical education. At these meetings, research findings from hospital, clinic, and physician's practice are discussed and their applications within the medical practice are illustrated. To date national chapters of the Society have been established in the following countries: Argentina Sociedad Argentina de of North America, 7961 Vauban, Montreal, Quebec, Terapia Antihomot\u00f3xica del P.O. 414, Sucursal Quito El Salvador Asociaci\u00f3n de Homotoxicolog\u00eda y Terapia Antihomot\u00f3xica de El Salvador, Apartado Postal No. 3, San Salvador C.

Progressive Auto-Sanguis Therapy according to Reckeweg 5.1 Introduction and remarks on theoretic aspects Medical history indicates autohemotherapy's effects to have first been recognized as a result of the following observation: in persons having sustained blunt traumata with haematoma formation, other affections were also discovered to vanish during the course of haematoma absorbtion. Consequently, therapy with the patient's own blood (autohaemotherapy) initially consisted of withdrawing a small quantity of blood from the patient and immediately re-introducing it through intramuscular, hypodermic injection. In this manner, an artificial hematoma was created. The conjecture then was that the injection of one's own blood would activate defensive powers which, in turn, would combat the \"forces of illness within the blood.\" Since then, autohemotherapy has been modified and perfected in multifarious ways, yet in actual practice, the original form of autohaemotherapeutic treatment - as irritation therapy, reversal therapy, non-specific excitation, or stimulation therapy - still finds application in numerous individual cases (e.g., in treatment of acne) with highly successful results. Progressive auto-sanguis therapy according to Reckeweg is autohaemotherapy in a specialized form. Developed from the fundamentals of homoeopathy in conjunction with Reckeweg's homotoxicological principles, this technique has proven in practical experience to be reliable and exceptionally effective in treating an extremely wide variety of chronic and degenerative diseases including bronchial asthma, eczema, hepatic damage and numerous other disorders (see also \"Empirically-Proven Indications\"). According to the teachings of Reckeweg's Homotoxicology, virtually every illness may be defined as either a defensive reaction by the organism against toxins or as the expression of toxic damage. It follows, therefore, that the blood of each patient contains those pathogenic poisons (homotoxins) typical for the disease from which that patient suffers. Through withdrawing a patient's blood, homoeopathically potentizing it over several levels and subsequently re-introducing it by means of hypodermic injection, Reckeweg holds that precisely these pathogenic poisons undergo modification to yield a homoeopathically active therapeutic agent ideal for application in stimulation therapy. In keeping with the Arndt-Schulz Law in the sense of the inverse effect, this agent stimulates the bodily defense systems, thus increasing detoxification and promoting the healing process. In accordance with B\u00fcrgi's Principle, the addition of appropriate homoeopathic injection preparations intensifies efficacy of the potentized auto-sanguis blood to an even higher degree. When potentizing the patient's blood during administration of progressive auto-sanguis therapy, therefore, it has proven expedient to employ the homoeopathic preparation which is therapeutically indicated in each individual patient's case. In summary, progressive auto-sanguis therapy is treatment designed to exert a counteractive effect against exogenic and endogenic homotoxins (including toxic deterioration products from the body's own cells), thus promoting the healing of chronic disease in a manner harmonious with the laws of nature. Also discussed in Homotoxicology are further mechanisms of action which play a role in auto-sanguis therapy, the homoeopathic inverse-effect exerted against both auto-antibodies and antigen-antibody reactions in particular. This effect is due to a complement factor which, as a component of the patient's own blood, is automatically injected in increasing degrees of attenuation during the course of treatment (the so-called complement-inverse-effect; at the 4th level, potentizing of the blood reaches a degree which approximately corresponds to that of C4!). This would also explain the positive effects in the area of desensitization/hyposensitization which progressive auto-sanguis therapy is frequently observed to achieve in cases of auto-aggressive disease. One must add, however, that no major scientific studies exist on the subject at this time. Presented here, rather, are the results of hypothetical deliberation based on the positive observations made during the course of daily medical practice. 5.2 Practical hints on administration Each session of progressive auto-sanguis therapy, also known as the auto-sanguis dilution cure, (1st to 4th (5th) stage) is to be completed in a single sitting. The blood required for preparation of the various autohemotherapeutic stages of potency may be acquired in the accustomed manner through tapping a vein by means of a hypodermic syringe. In cases in which intravenous injection is performed immediately prior to commencing progressive auto-sanguis therapy, a further possibility presents itself. Here, the same syringe, unrinsed and still containing traces of blood, may be utilized for production of the required auto-hemotherapeutic potency-levels. Imperative in both cases is the subsequent, virtually complete expulsion of all contents from the syringe, allowing only minuscule quantities of blood to remain in the cone, possibly combined with remaining traces of the previously-applied injection solution. Note In cases in which the patient's vein cannot be punctured due to technical or other considerations, the drop of blood required for performing progressive auto-sanguis therapy may be obtained from the fingertip or earlobe by means of a spring lancet. With this method, logically, the first stage need not be applied i.v. either. When employing the \"lancet method\" of application for the first stage of progressive auto-sanguis therapy, rather, application may be performed through i.m., s.c., or i.d. injection or segmentally and neurotherapeutic aspects. The conduction of the progressive auto-sanguis therapy is performed currently in accordance with the following rules: Stage 1: Symptomatic remedy (e.g. Traumeel S , Belladonna- H o m a c c o r d , Apis_Homaccord , Engystol N ) Stage remedy, e.g., Lymphomyosot , Galium-Heel ) Stage 3: Organ preparation (e.g. suis-organ remedies such as Hepar compositum as Penicillin-Injeel, Doxycyclin-Injeel, Cortison-Injeel) All four stages are generally applied in one session. The application of stage 1 was described above. After application of the first stage the syringe is emptied as completely as possible so that only traces of the injection fluid of stage 1 still remain in the syringe's cone. Then, the same syringe is drawn up with the preparation of stage 2. A small space has to be left for agitation and then the syringe is briskly agitated 10 times. The thus prepared stage 2 is then injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously, possib-ly segmentally or also into acupuncture points, trigger points, etc. Stage 3 is prepared by drawing up the same syringe with the organ preparation, leaving a space for agitation, and then by briskly shaking the syringe ten times to produce homoeopathic potentization of the content. This third stage can then be injected as in stage 2 either i.m., s.c. or i.c. Stage 4 is then prepared in the same manner as in the previous stages with nosode preparations or homoeopathically adjusted allopathic medications. It is important that all of the stages are prepared with the same syringe. Only this method guarantees that the drop of blood, which was initially obtained during the application of stage 1, is also progressively potentized. Repetition Injection of forte-strength Injeels should be temporarily avoided during the initial phase of therapy. Ensuing a period of 2 to 3 weeks, however, this form may be applied provided no excessive reactions (so-called \"therapeutic crises\") have occurred during the employment of the standard Injeels and highly potentized preparations. As a rule, an interval of at least 4 to 5 days should be observed between each of the sessions, as the organism requires this period for development of the anticipated reaction for biological reasons. Any initially-occurring adverse effects must be allowed to subside prior to renewed application. Repetition of progressive auto-sanguis therapy in intervals more frequent than those designated (e.g., every three days or less) should be reserved for exceptional cases only and is to be administered exclusively by therapists having acquired adequate experience with this therapeutic technique. The combination with other auto-sanguis therapies such as UVA/B/E, ozone therapy or HOT is also possible and extremely successful. For the performance of the progressive auto-sanguis therapy, a drop of blood remaining from one of these cited methods is employed for further potentizing. It is not advisable to expose the homoeopathic preparations to ultra-violet light or to dilute them with ozone since it is not known whether the homoeopathic information is altered thereby. 5.3 Hyperimmunization according to Reckeweg Hyperimmunization according to Reckeweg is to be interjected during treatment of cases in which response to progressive auto-sanguis therapy is absent or insufficient in strength and/or duration. This therapeutic technique targets the eliminative organs, stimulating them in their functional capabilities. Precisely these functions are largely responsible for the degree of efficacy of progressive auto-sanguis therapy, making their optimum function crucial for its success. Hyperimmunization consists of a series of subcutaneous or intramuscular injections performed at brief intervals (as far as practicable; e.g., every 3 to 4 hours) employing either one and the same suis-organ preparation (possibly even in increasing strengths) or utilizing suis-organ remedies of various types. A general therapeutic plan might appear as follows: 1. Vesica urinaria suis-Injeel 2. 5. Pulmo and Bronchus suis-Injeel It shall be noted, however, that hyperimmunization according to Reckeweg is indicated only in extremely rare cases; one of the reasons being the high demands this technique makes on the patient's collaboration. If separate injection of the corresponding suis-organ preparations is not possible due to lack of time, all of the preparations can be mixed and administered in one injection subcutaneously. The effect is somewhat weakened thereby and the injection must be repeated the next day. 5.4 Empirically-proven indications with therapy schemata Experience has proven progressive auto-sanguis therapy according to Reckeweg with biotherapeutic, anti-homotoxic preparations to be particularly reliable in treatment of the following syndromes (among others): 1. Therapeutic damage due to medication 2. Recurrent viral infection 3. Precancerous stages 4. Hepatic damage due to toxins 5. Migraine 6. Chronic eczema 7. Bronchial asthma 8. Duodenal and gastric ulcers 9. Arthrosis 10. Lymphatic diathesis / lymphatism The number of stages to be potentized and the selection of preparations for application must, of course, always be individually adjusted to correspond with the symptom-picture and response of each patient. Presented below are well-proven therapeutic schemata for the 10 above-listed syndromes together with the most important preparations. In some cases, the indicated principal remedies include nosodes which must be applied only during the final stage and are not to be potentized. Also included in the following therapeutic schemata are the suitable adjuvant therapies (oral or other), thus providing a comprehensive treatment unit. Here once again, introduction of certain modifications according to the particular situation of the corresponding case is both feasible and expedient. Once the chronic phase of the corresponding illness has been disrupted through progressive auto-sanguis therapy, simple oral application is adequate for continued treatment in numerous cases. The cited preparations are a selection of the anti-homotoxic remedies frequently used for these indications. Depending on the indication and symptomatology of the patient, they can be injected individually or as a mixture of several ampoule preparations per stage. Of course not all of the cited remedies must be administered in every case. Note The therapy schemata presented below identify the medicinal preparations to be administered in the various stages of progressive auto-sanguineous therapy not by number, but rather by letter. The reason for this is the fact that - depending upon the method employed in acquiring the initial blood - the delegation of preparations to each individual stage differs. The preparation designated under position A) may either be directly drawn into the syringe and immediately injected i.v. (which, strictly speaking, would correspond to \"stage 0\" of progressive auto-sanguis therapy), or, ensuing previous aspiration and ejection of a drop of blood (procured from a vein or by means of the \"spring-lance method\"), it may then be drawn up into the syringe and hypodermically injected (in this case corresponding to the first stage of the blood's potentization). Both modes of procedure are considered therapeutically equivalent in value. The remedies appearing under positions B), C), etc. are then utilized to prepare the further stages of potentization in the designated order. 5.4.1 Iatrogenic damage A. and analog homoeopathically adjusted allopathic medication (anamnesis and/or remedy testing!) Due to the simile effect, selection of a substance defined as chemically similar (= \"Simile Principle\") is preferable to that of the precise isopathic agent (= \"Principle of Likeness\") in choosing a corresponding homoeopathically adjusted allopathic agent at the final stage. The simile action of the former is distinctly stronger. An example of this is seen in glucocorticoid therapy, during which the effects produced by mineralocorticoid are clearly the more valuable.

Dedifferentiation Phases (formerly Neoplasm Phases) 6.1 Principles of the anti-homotoxic treatment of tumors The physician's action, particularly during the clinical treatment of tumors, is frequently subject to collective constraints originating from a societal-psychological principle of the persistence of the paradigm of the mono-causal \"search and destroy strategy\" with the tumor cell as the target area. This therapy approach is currently evolving towards recognition of the influence of the endogenic defense system with its spiritual-mental-bodily basis upon the resistance against tumors and thus on the success of the therapy and also on the further prognosis (\"Psycho-oncology\" 1, 4) During the 1970s it became increasingly apparent that no progress was being made in the treatment of tumors. Even patients decided ever more frequently to attempt alternative possibilities of treatment. Today the borderline between the individual concepts is becoming less and less distinct, biological complementary treatments during conventional cancer therapy are being employed more often (an up-to-date overview is provided by the major topic \"Complementary Oncology\" in: Erfahrungsheilkunde 1998, Book 2, Volume 47). Depending on the character and degree of severity, a multitude of medications of allopathic, homoeopathic, and phytopharmaceutical origin are available. The valence of the tumor is the actual determining factor which extensively determines the result of the treatment. It is defined by: 1. The location and extension of the tumor 2. The growth velocity of the tumor 3. The metastatic ability of the tumor The cell metabolism depends on the supply of substrates and the removal of final products, especially of generated free radicals. Our vascular and lymphatic systems are dependent on special nervous, afferent, and efferent influences. A somatic cell can not be viewed separate from the surrounding extracellular matrix (ground substance), as the state of the matrix determines the state of the cell, and thus that of the tumor cell as well.1, 4) The valence of the tumor is therefore dependent on a finely regulated cybernetic system characterized by a multitude of interdependencies. Long-term disturbances, e.g., those originating from environmental factors, stress, incorrect diet, etc. cause disorders of the matrix and diminution of the defense power, which in turn promotes a malignant development. Also metastases are only able to survive when \"disturbed,\" that is, in a matrix suited for them (overview at Heine, 1996). 1) As oncogenesis always affects the total organism, the cancerous disease must be regarded as a general disease. The matrix-damaging substances (radical ions, activators of proteolytic enzymes, cytokines, growth factors, etc.) released during cellular dedifferentiation (neoplasm) of the cancerous process, lead to a global latent acidosis of the matrix through which in turn the cancerous process is activated, etc. Ultimately, the process leads to a biological unresponsiveness with immunological blinding accompanied by a deficient psychical ability to perceive, encounter, and analyze the condition. The great disadvantage of chemotherapy is its direct alignment on the cancer cell without taking into consideration that an extracellular space with ground substance surrounds each cell as a functional guard. Subsequently, the cytostasis inevitably leads to severe disorders of the ground substance and thus of its regulation conditions as well: The defense systems are weakened Radical ions occur increasingly due to cell metabolism disorders The latent tissue acidosis increases The potential of proteolytic tissue increases The endangerment of the tissue regulation increases Chemotherapy must therefore be screened in order to maintain and/or restore the ground regulation and activate the defense. In this case the adjuvant anti-homotoxic therapy can be of great assistance. This applies particularly to the activation of regulatory lymphocyte clones through anti-homotoxic remedies which are interpolated in the mutual modulation of the cellular and humoral defense systems.3, 4) Conventional cancer treatment includes the local and loco-regional, macroscopic, surgical elimination, as well as a computer-controlled radiation treatment, and a systematic chemotherapy in accordance with the respective state of the tumor with the target of the microscopic removal of the tumor as well. Apart from the multiple side effects, even refined surgical and radiological treatment strategies for multi-modal concepts generally do not promise great success. Tumorous cancer research of the past years has shown that minerals and trace elements, the vitamins A, C, and E as well as certain enzymes are essential for a series of control systems. These substances must be substituted. Holistic treatment of tumors also includes the treating of the psychic problems of the patient and the fortification of his mental powers of endurance during and after treatment of the tumor. Holistic treatment of tumors is therefore composed of three main components: 1. Conventional treatment of tumors by Surgical measures Radiotherapy Chemotherapy 2. Biological complementary therapy Reinforcement of the endogenic defense system Substitution treatment and regeneration treatment 3. Psychic-mental components Corresponding psychologically learnable mental tumor defense methods. Although a carcinoma is, from the viewpoint of Homotoxicology, the most progressed phase of the homotoxicosis, remissions have been observed under deliberate, adjuvant biological therapy. It must be emphasized that biological therapy does not strive for a collision with the proven conventional therapy forms. It is performed additionally and supplementarily. First, the tumor mass must be reduced through surgery and radiation. The following basic principles are important: 1. Excretion + detoxification 2. Diet 3. Immunostimulation/Immunomodulation The therapy commences with a pure excretion and detoxification therapy for the duration of several weeks. In parallel a change of eating habits is commenced. The diet therapy should comprise a standard diet without fattened meats. Animal fats and proteins should be greatly reduced. (Note to dispense with foods containing arachidonic acid and with inflammation mediators, etc.) In addition, all foods prepared with coloring agents and preservatives should be removed from the diet. Alcohol and nicotine are prohibited. After completion of the excretion and detoxification therapy, an immunostimulating/immunomodulating therapy is commenced. 6.2 Therapy plan 6.2.1 Excretion and detoxification therapy Examples of an oral therapy: Lymphomyosot (tablets, drops) 3 tablets 3 times daily or 10 to 20 drops three times daily Nux vomica-Homaccord (drops) 10 drops 3 times daily Berberis-Homaccord (drops) 10 drops 3 times daily or Hepeel + Renee l (tablets) 1 tablet each times daily The routine cure according to Leimbach is a recommendable alternative to or supplementation of this excretion therapy: Rx: Galium-Heel 8 to 10 drops 6x daily, eight weeks, Lymphomyosot thereafter 8 to 10 drops 4x daily, Psorinoheel eight weeks thereafter 8 to suitable for a parenteral therapy. The ampoule preparations are injected 3x weekly i.m., s.c., i.c., or i.v. or mixed in the form of an oral ampoule medication. The preparation Lymphomyosot is suitable for parenteral as well as oral application in the form of drops (20 drops 3x daily). Recommended parallel to excretion therapy Due to continual contact of intermediary hormones, a state of chronic stress develops within the body. This results in an increasing degree of adrenocortical exhaustion. Therefore, an expedient measure is the interpolation with Berberis-Homaccord . Due to a latent tissue acidosis, extracellular and intracellular metabolic blocks are frequently diagnosed in carcinoma patients. These blocks can be disrupted through the application of the catalyst preparations Coenzyme compositum and Ubichinon compositum (3x weekly in the above mentioned application form). To stimulate depolymerization additionally to Ubichinon compositum , the application of Glyoxal compositum is advisable, which is generally only administered when recovery starts to flag. Para-Benzochinon-Injeel D30 and cAMP D30 can be recommended as alternating remedies. After an excretion phase of approximately four weeks, a special immunostimulating and/or immunomodulating therapy may be conducted. 6.2.2 Carcinoma bronchium-Injeel (forte), Carcinoma coli-Injeel (forte), Carcinoma hepatis-Injeel (forte), Carcinoma hepatis metastatis-Injeel (forte), Carcinoma laryngis-Injeel (forte), Carcinoma mammae-Injeel (forte), Carcinoma uteri-Injeel (forte). Carcinoma nosode preparations are not available for all cancerous diseases, but they can be applied in accordance with the homoeopathic simile principle. The selection is conducted based on the type of tumor and the location of the tumor, most preferably through a naturopathic test procedure (EAV, Kinesiology). a.a. Progressive auto-sanguis therapy (See Progressive Auto-Sanguis 42.) b. Thymus therapy (Thymus THX) c. Mistletoe preparations d. Cytoplasmatic Oxygen therapies Ozone-Oxygen-Therapy/HOT Oxygen-Multiple-Therapy f. Hypothermia 6.2.2.1 Note A variety of biological preparations are available for an in-depth treatment of localized carcinomas, e.g., carcinoma of the stomach. These preparations can be employed via electro-acupuncture: Ulcus nosode preparations are to be used specially and they differ from case to case. In addition to the cited therapies with Heel preparations the following measures are recommended during a biological treatment: a) A highly dosed long-term therapy with enzyme preparations b) Highly dosed Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and/or b-Carotine + Vitamin E (Vitamin E doses must not be administered in case of hormone-active tumors, such as carcinoma of the ovaries, certain types of carcinomas of the breast, carcinomas of the testicles, etc.) c) Sanitation of the intestines d) Selenium oral ampoules daily as a long-term therapy e) For detoxification orthosiphone leaves daily f) Beet root concentrates daily or simply beet root juice 6.2.3 Supplementary therapy of chemotherapy During the period of chemotherapy (several weeks to months): Mistletoe preparations see packaging insert Ubichinon compositum 1 ampoule 2x weekly s.c. Enzymes see packaging insert Nux vomica-Homaccord 15 drops 3x daily Vitamine C 4 g daily Selenium 3x weekly 1 dosage \u00df-Carotine, Vitamine E 1-1,5 mg and/or 500-1000 I.E. In addition, large quantities of dextrorotatory lactic acids as well as zinc and copper dependent on the spectral analysis should be taken. After chemotherapy: Thymus injections Symbiosis regulation: 2 together ampoule each 6.2.4 Supplementary radiotherapy The weekly injection of 1-3 ampoules Causticum compositum is advisable in this case. 6.3 Note Several biological methods can and should be employed in combination to increase the success of the therapy, such as anti-homotoxic therapy and ozone therapy. Biological therapy is a long-term therapy. It not only results in a strengthening of the endogenic defense system and thereby of the tumor defense system, but also in the diminution of the side effects of the radiation treatments and cytostatic therapy. An improvement of the bodily constitution (e.g., through increase of appetite) as well as of the psychic situation (e.g., less fear, more energy) must be regarded as a positive effect and contributes to the improvement of the quality of life. Therefore, the immunotherapy is the foundation of the biological cancer treatment. It should be integrated into the therapy plan along with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy right from the start. 6.4 References (1) Heine H. Psychoonkologie. Z Onkol 1996; 28(1): Humanmedizin.

Pain Therapies Since oral therapies yield significant successes in this case only after a lengthy period of time, they should always only be supplemental at the beginning of pain therapy. Due to the administration of the matching bio-therapeutic remedy, the homotoxic situation underlying the pain is influenced. Children's diseases such as the measles, mumps, and chicken pox, can originally underlie the pain progress as well as influenzal infections, angina, infective hepatitis, renal disorders, and odentalgia In this case, nosode therapy can eliminate residual toxins of previously overcome diseases from the body. As a start for a rapid improvement of the symptomatology, injection therapies are recommended. Through the infiltration of a local anesthetic into the focus of infection the field of disturbance can be blocked out temporarily and the pain can be affected within seconds. The diagnostic and therapeutic local anesthesia is, when properly applied, the preferred method for the treatment of pain. Possible injection locations Injection on the locus dolendi Injection in the segment Injection on the nerve root or ganglion Injection on and in joints Injection on the periostium Injection on the field of disturbance The therapeutic effect can be improved through the incorporation of homoeopathic compound preparations. Depending on the type of pain the following are recommended: Gelsemium-Homaccord , Neuralgic inflammatory pains Atropinum compositum Colic and spasms 7.1 Indications and therapy suggestions 7.1.1 Injection of local anesthesia in combination with a Anti-homotoxic remedy \u007f7.1.1.1 Rachiopathy Cervical vertebral column The symptomatology in the area of the cervical vertebral column varies greatly depending on the location of the alteration. Upper cervical syndrome Trachelodynia, occiput pains, cervical m i g r a i n e Middle cervical syndrome Shoulder pain Lower cervical syndrome Brachialgia, myalgia in the shoulder and neck area, epicondylitis The mixture of a local anesthetic with a homoeopathic compound remedy is advisable for the therapy. It is thereby possible to connect the immediate effect of the diagnostic and therapeutic local anesthesia with the healing effect of homoeopathy. Degenerative spondylopathy 1 amp.

Toxin Affliction The effects of toxic affliction (homotoxins) upon the progress of the patients' diseases has always been known in the anti-homotoxic therapy. Their importance is being increasingly acknowledged in traditional medicine as well. In Germany, the special qualification of environmental medicine was introduced recently. Toxins can be detected down to concentrations of single molecules. The diagnosis is, however, relatively difficult, since the symptomatology is quite unspecific. Observed symptoms include tiredness, concentration difficulties, or headaches, hyperactivity, proneness to infections, and allergies. These symptoms are frequently misinterpreted as psychosomatic manifestations. The development of chronic diseases of the rheumatic syndromes, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as renal and vesical diseases may also be triggered by toxins. Environmental stress factors manifest the most severe symptomatology in the clinical syndrome Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS). The concept of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity was introduced by the American physician Randolph in the 1960's. According to his definition, it is an acquired disease, caused by an excessive overloading of the human organism with exogenic substances. The patients react to numerous chemicals with relatively uniform symptomatology. The diagnosis is extremely laborious and time-consuming, a repertorization according to anti-homotoxic principles is helpful in these cases. A further clinical syndrome, which leads to difficulties during diagnostics and therapy, is the Sick-Building-Syndrome (SBS). This is an internationally employed term for feelings of ill health and discomfort, which occur in interior building spaces. In 1983, the WHO defined the Sick-Building-Syndrome as follows: A certain number of people in the same room/building (approximately 20 %) complain spontaneously of unspecific symptoms/discomforts which appear during a stay in these rooms/buildings, possibly worsen here, and which improve or completely disappear after the people have left the room/building. Whereas the diagnosis of toxin-related diseases is continually making progress, hardly any traditional treatment concepts for the therapy are available. In this case, naturopathic treatments must be considered as superior. Homotoxicology rests on three pillars during treatment: 1. Avoidance of further intake/supply of toxins. 2. Improvement of the cell and organ function. 3. Optimization of the detoxifying and excretion functions. Orthomolecular therapy plays an increasingly significant role in the prevention of toxic affliction. Patients can be protected quite well through high doses of vitamins, minerals, and trace elements (e.g., Vitamine E, Vitamine C, beta-carotine, magnesium, and selenium). Anti-homotoxic therapy is the best method for the excretion and detoxification therapy as well as improvement of the organ functions. The basic remedy for the detoxification therapy is Lymphomyosot . This preparation detoxifies the matrix and lymph system. In particular, it has been successfully employed for the detoxification of heavy metal loads. For this reason, it is applied routinely prior to, during, and after an amalgam sanitation (see section Amalgam excretion, page 59). The preparation Galium-Heel is frequently administered additionally for the detoxification of the cytoplasm. Since environmental stress factors frequently deposit so-called metabolic blocks, the administration of the bio-catalysts is essential. In most cases, the two preparations Coenzyme compositum and Ubichinon compositum are administered together two to three times a week. An infusion therapy is particularly advisable for general excretion and detoxification. To this purpose to a commercial full electrolyte solution (250 ml) the preparations Hepar compositum for the liver, Solidago compositum S for the kidneys, Nux vomica- Homaccord for the stomach, and Lymphomyosot for the lymph tissue are added. These infusions are administered in most cases twice a week, for a total of five to ten times. For the treatment of considerably metabolically-blocked patients (metabolic syndrome), the so-called catalyst infusion is administered initially. All ten ampoules in the multi-package of the citric acid cycle catalysts are added to an infusion solution. An oral excretion therapy is also possible: Lymphomyosot (tablets, drops) 3 tablets 3 times daily or 10 to 20 drops three times daily Nux vomica-Homaccord (drops) 10 drops three times daily Berberis-Homaccord (drops) 10 drops three times daily or Hepeel + Reneel (tablets) 1 tablet each three times daily A disorder in the area of trace elements is frequently determined in cases of toxic affliction. The preparation Molybd\u00e4n compositum (1 tablet twice a week) is administered to balance this disorder. An enzyme therapy is also suitable for the degradation of waste products. The above-mentioned preparation combinations (parenteral or oral) are to be considered as optimal detoxification therapies and should be conducted in conjunction with holistic measures such as change of diet, sanitation of the intestinal tract, reduction of stress, light exercise, etc. for a period of several months. This excretion therapy is also particularly indicated as the first step of the treatment of all chronic diseases to detoxify the matrix, thus enabling it to be accessible again to the regulatory influences of the anti-homotoxic therapy. 8.1 References (1) Wolf C. Arzneimittel-, und Umwelt Marseille Verlag Jg. Heft 1, S. 105-111 9. Amalgam-Excretion The term amalgam damages usually refers to the negative impacts on the organism caused by mercury released from amalgam fillings. Dentists have been confronted with the complaints of patients with amalgam fillings for years. Due to the observation of secondary diseases caused by mercury loads in the body, criticism of the use of amalgam has increased recently throughout the world. It must be noted in this case that the question, whether and to what extent damages caused by amalgam fillings are possible, is currently being discussed contrarily, and specialists have not as yet reached an agreement on this subject. It is generally agreed however to attempt to avoid amalgam fillings through the prophylaxis of dental cavities. Amalgam is a composition metal, which is usually composed of 53% mercury, 20% silver, 16% tin, and 10% copper. The toxicity of mercury is based primarily on its effect as a cell toxin. The heavy metal binds the sulfhydryl groups of proteins and thus blocks various vital enzyme systems. Mercury is deposited in the liver, kidneys, spleen, and in the brain as well and is excreted extremely slowly (normal Hg-level in urine 0.5 - 5 micrograms/day). Particularly the long half-life period of mercury in the brain of approximately 18 years substantiates the proposition that, once mercury has entered the brain, it hardly ever leaves this organ during the patient's lifetime. Acute symptoms of mercury poisoning include salivation, stomatitis, gastroenteritis, ulcerous hemorrhagic colitis with vomiting, colic and diarrhea, nephritis with anuria, and uraemia. Chronic mercury poisoning displays symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, and pain in limbs, salivation, stomatitis, albuminuria, central nervous symptoms such as mood lability, fear, excitement, muscular twitching, impaired vision, hearing defects, speech defects, and gait defects, memory weakness, personality breakdown, as well as sensitive, symmetrical polyneuropathies (paraesthesia, analgesia) (Reference: \"Handlexikon company Urban & Schwarzenberg, Munich - Vienna - Baltimore). The danger of an immunosuppression, caused by the mobilization of mercury from amalgam fillings, must also be pointed out. Thus, a reaction of the immune system occurs only a few minutes after mercury mobilization triggered by chewing bubble gum for 20 minutes or drinking sips of lemon tea, whereby the activity of the T-lymphocytes, the T-helper cells and the natural killer cells significantly decreases. Mercury and its components can disrupt the system of the energy paths (meridians, energy vessels according to Voll). From the viewpoint of holistic, cybernetic concepts, very fine information impulses can be emanated from the metallic components of amalgam which completely impair the energy paths according to Voll. When the amalgam or its components have been identified as regulatory cycle disturbances through a regulatory-diagnostic procedure such as electro-acupuncture according to Voll, all of the amalgam fillings should be removed at greater intervals during the first phase of therapy. An excretion and regulation therapy particularly with biological therapeutic remedies must be conducted thereafter to remove the metals deposited in the tissues. In simple cases, the excretion therapy can be conducted via homoeopathic compound or single constituent remedies. Severely disturbed patients require a regulation therapy via tested homoeopathic and isopathic remedies, in especially severe cases a parenteral administration of heavy metal binding antidotes such as DMPS is indicated. Initial results with Heel preparations for the treatment of amalgam damages are available for Lymphomyosot (drops), which promotes the excretion of possibly reabsorbed mercury via ist purifying and channeling effect on the matrix. We recommend a dosage of 15-20 drops of Lymphomyosot 3 times daily. Several of the Injeel preparations (e.g., Mercurius vivus-Injeel, Mercurius solubilis Hahnemanni-Injeel, etc.) contain potentized mercury as a potency chord and can be employed in terms of a homoeopathic simile for this purpose. Further detoxification remedies from the preparation program, which aside from Lymphomyosot should be employed in all of the cellular phases, include Galium-Heel , Psorinoheel , as well as Nux vomica-Homaccord . A normal dosage of 20 drops each 3 times daily is recommended. To protect important cell organelles (e.g., the mitochondria) against free radicals (especially oxygen radicals), a selenium therapy in conjunction with anti-oxidants such as Vitamin E should be included in the therapy plan. As with all chronic toxic afflictions, the supply of essential nutrients is also of great significance during the therapy. These include the essential amino acids (valine, acids such as linoleic and linolenic acid), minerals, trace elements, and vitamins. In particular, the essential trace elements (selenium, zinc, molybdenum, manganese, chrome, cobalt, copper, nickel, silicium, vanadium, iodine and fluorine), which are present in the body only in very slight amounts, whose lack however leads to disorders of bio-chemical processes, must be available to a sufficient measure (Reference: \"Documenta Geigy, Wissenschaftliche Basic information \u007f10.1.1 Immunological aspects Immunomodulatory therapy exerts its influence within the realm of the immune system. As we know today, the structure of the immunological network is much more highly complex than originally believed.3,8) Not only does this system \"provide immunity,\" i.e., furnish protection from contagion, but it also plays a key role in the performance of numerous other functions in conjunction with the body's microflora and mucosa, plus its metabolic, nervous, and hormonal systems. Phylogenetically, the intestine may be considered the cradle of the immune system. The skin - the mucous membranes of the digestive tract in particular - represents the body's surface of immediate contact with the environment; thus it is quite logical that these contact surfaces should hold especially high immunological significance. Only in the past few years has the medical world come to realize the fact that approximately 85% of the human immune system lies within the body's mucosae. From an ontogenetic point of view, the morphological basis of this relatively autonomous system consists of organs which developed from the entoderm. First to be recognized in this respect was the existence of independent, gastrointestinally-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT). The most recent status of knowledge in this area indicates the mucosal immune system as being common to all mucous membranes and interconnecting the various organs with one another.1,2,13) The immunological system of the mucosae serves an exceptionally expansive area of contact surfaces, e.g., 400 m2 within the small and large intestines and 80 m2 within the lungs (skin area: 2.5 m2). A large portion of these mucous membranes are normally colonized by micro-organisms.1,15,16) \u007f10.1.2 Microbiological aspectsThe human body is host to an incredibly vast variety and quantity of colonizing micro- organisms. Here, microbial communities of multiplex composition thrive in varying densities within diverse habitats. The intestines alone harbor 300 to 500 different types of microbes, the further classification of which distributes them into 17 families and 47 genera. Meticulous studies conducted on germ-free animals have revealed a great deal in regard to the significance of microflora, particularly concerning the structure and function of the immune system. In experimental animals, which were kept in a germ-free environment, 85 percent of the immunological system (namely the mucosal immune system) was shown to be completely undeveloped. The granulocyte count was substantially reduced while those granulocytes present displayed functional limitations. Inoculation of germ-free animals with a variety of micro-organisms enabled study of the relationships as they exist among the various microbes. Results of this investigation indicated that complex microbial communities stabilize in states of equilibrium which oppose externally-invading microbes in their efforts to establish colonization. This opposition is known as \"colonization resistance.\" Normal microflora, therefore, is of crucial importance to the structural and functional capabilities of the mucosal immune-system specifically, as well as to the entire immune system in general. In addition, normal microflora develops a certain degree of protective action of its own, directed against externally-invading pathological agents. For this reason, microflora is an exceptionally decisive factor for any individual's status of health and/or disease. The deployment order of defensive measures within the majority of mucosae denotes normal microflora as one of the initial defensive barriers. 1,15,16) \u007f10.1.3 Symbiosis The term \"symbiosis\" was defined in 1879 by Anton Heinrich de Bary as the continual, close-knit cohabitation of organisms of diverse designation. This definition of symbiosis encompasses a great number of life-partnerships including parasitism, neutralism, commensalism, and mutualism.12) As early as 1951, Gregory stated, \"the value of this interpretation lies in the expansion of the concept of the structural entity of an organism to include heterogenic systems which operate conjointly as a functional unit or field\". 10) Applying this conception to their observations on populations of microflora within the alimentary tract10), an international research-committee determined the human body/microbial correlation to correspond perfectly with the definition of a symbiotic partnership as described by de Bary. \"Normal\" human microflora also contains opportunistic pathological agents with which the body maintains a status of continuous, close cohabitation. These agents are normally kept in check by neutral, commensal, and mutualistic micro-organisms and are thus held incapable of developing their disease-promoting properties.10) \u007f10.1.4 Probiotic agents Until very recently, the definition of the term \"probiotics\" has been extremely diffuse, encompassing an array of concepts highly diverse in nature. In June of 1994, a seminar was conducted on the subject, \"Probiotics: Prospects of Application in Treating Opportunistic Infection\". An international team of experts attending this seminar collaborated to develop the following definition: \"A probiotic agent is a microbial preparation containing live and/or killed microbes, including any constituent parts or metabolic products thereof. Probiotic agents may be employed as food additives, preventative substances, or therapeutic agents\". 17) 10.2 Microbiological therapy \u007f10.2.1 Definition Microbiological therapy is defined as the oral or parenteral application of various live and/or killed microbes and/or their components for therapeutic purposes. The two essential elements of microbiological therapy are microbial preparations and auto-vaccines. The Physician's Desk Reference of Germany (die Rote Liste) contains approximately 35 microbial preparations.6) Despite the enormous spectrum of symbiotic microbial varieties, the majority of preparations are generally prepared from only four types: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. such therapy is the non-symbiotic microbe Saccharomyces boulardii. \u007f10.2.2 Mechanisms of action Microbiological therapy employing microbial preparations and auto-vaccines4) is a therapeutic technique which has attained scientific substantiation.6,11) This treatment, originally incomprehensible from the conventionalized view, was developed on the grounds of previously-acquired experience and has been utilized for treating the most varied of affections, including acute as well as chronic inflammation of the E/N/T region, respiratory tract, gastro-intestinal vicinity and urogenital tract in addition to allergies and other disorders. Through recent immunological research, this therapy has since earned the validation of the followers of conventional medicine as well. The liberation of the cytokinetic substances interleukin-1\u00df,1L-6 and interferon-\u00df is stimulated in direct correlation with dosage. When applied orally, microbial preparations activate dormant beta cells, causing these cells to proliferate in the sense of a cascade reaction which thereby enhances IgA-synthesis. This stimulation of the activity level of the mucosal immune-system is verified through an increase of secretory IgA in the saliva.7, 9, 11, 14, 17) By means of various immunological signals, this therapy meshes with and effectively influences the complex cog-and-gear machinery existing among the mucosal immune system, the general immunological system, nervous system, the hormonal system, and the metabolism. Thus this empiric knowledge medical professionals have meticulously acquired over a period of more than forty years in the field of therapeutic application of microbial preparations and auto-vaccines has received impressive verification. \u007f10.2.3 Indications Controlled clinical tests have confirmed the indications for microbiological therapy to include the following: immunomodulation; coryzal affections; chronic, recurrent infections of the respiratory tract; chronic sinusitis; inflammation within the regions of the mouth, nose, tympanum, and pharynx; gastro-intestinal disorders; irritable colon, and infections of the urinary tract. Experience has shown further indications to encompass such affections as gastro-enteritis, enterocolitis, post-antibiotic colitis, ulcerative colitis, diseases, allergic affections, and mycosis. These indications, all of which interact with the entodermogenic, mucosal immune-system, are currently and further clinical examination. The exceptionally broad spectrum of indications may be explained through the substrate role which the mucosal immune system plays; a system which is common to them all. 2, 13) \u007f10.2.4 Combination therapy In keeping with the concept of holistic therapy, microbiological treatment may be successfully conjoined within the physician's practice with the measures of anti-homotoxic therapy and dietary regimen. \u007f10.2.5 Anti-homotoxic therapy Successful microbiological therapy should always include anti-homotoxic treatment, for normal, functional flora can thrive only within a healthy physiological milieu. Such factors as environmental stress, incorrect diet, and even allopathic medication (e.g., frequent application of antibiotics) can lead to serious alteration of milieu, particularly in patients suffering from chronic illness. This unhealthy alteration may be treated with the aid of anti-homotoxic medicine. The initial step in treating such chronic affections should therefore be the performance of detoxification therapy. The base agent of microbiological therapy consists of Nux vomica-Homaccord . This homoeopathic combination-preparation induces functional improvement within the region of the alimentary canal. The second preparation, equally important during detoxification therapy, is Lymphomyosot . This medication exerts a lymph-mobilizing, mesenchyme- cleansing effect. Hepar compositum is employed for activation of the detoxicant functions of the liver, while Solidago compositum S is utilized to promote renal elimination. Consumption of ample fluids supports this treatment, the most beneficial of these being water (low in mineral content) as well as juices produced from various fruits and vegetables. For microbiological therapy to function properly, sufficient intake of fluids is indispensable as well. The adult female normally requires an intake of 2 liters of liquids daily, the corresponding quantity for adult males is 3 liters. This amount may be increased to 4 to 5 liters per day during the course of detoxification therapy. The preparation Mucosa compositum may be employed for activation of bodily defense-mechanisms in treatment of mucosal affections of the most varied types and localization; Cutis compositum is appropriate for treating diseases of the skin. Traumeel S has proven its reliability for therapy of all forms of inflammatory disease, including those within the gastro-intestinal region. The medication Podophyllum compositum is a reliable agent in cases displaying colitic symptoms. Spascupreel (S) is utilized in treatment of spastic conditions; general sensations of unwellness and nausea of various origin are treated by means of Vomitusheel (S). A wealth of further homoeopathic combination-preparations (such as Duodenoheel , Gastricumeel , Hepeel etc.) is also available, as is an entire range of single-constituent homoeopathic medications, all of which are excellently suited for utilization in microbiological therapy for the purpose of immunomodulation. Previous infectional illnesses - those within the gastro-intestinal region in particular - may subsequently cause development of chronic pathological symptoms. In such cases, specific nosode therapy provides a feasible means of causal naturopathic treatment. Please refer to chapter Therapeutic Index of this book for further particulars on this subject. \u007f10.2.6 Alimentary therapy The manner in which a patient conducts his or her life is a crucial factor in securing long-term retention of the improvement achieved through therapeutic measures. One of the most important elements holistic therapy should always include are guidelines in regard to dietary regimen.5) 10.3 References (1) Berg, Rodney D., Waaij, van der, Dirk, Heidt, Peter J., and Rusch, Volker C.: Interactions Between the Indigenous Microflora and the Host Immune System.

General Rules for the Practical Therapeutic Application of Heel Preparations The preparations appearing in this Therapeutic Index were compiled on the basis of the experience gained by innumerable therapists from every field of medicine, including MD's and dentists, who have acquired familiarity with the homoeopathic/anti-homotoxic technique over a period of many years. In addition, the findings of recent scientific investigations (e.g., drug monitoring, medical trials, clinical trials, etc.) have been incorporated into the therapeutic recommendations presented here as well. In principle, most Heel preparations may be employed in either of two modes depending upon the type of disorder involved: 1. As acute therapy, for treatment of suddenly-occurring illnesses or symptoms. 2. As long-term therapy, for treating conditions of chronic diseases. In acute therapy, the appropriate preparation is to be administered frequently. Treatment commences as a rule in massive-dose therapy of 1 tablet or 10 drops every 15 minutes over a maximum period of 2 hours. Preparations for hypodermic injection indicated in acute treatment are initially to be applied daily (particularly serious pathological processes may require application up to 3 times per day). As a general rule, the more severe and acute the symptoms, the greater the frequency in which the indicated preparations are to be administered. Upon achieving improvement, the frequency should gradually be reduced. For long-term treatment of chronic affections, orally-applied preparations are generally administered three times daily in a dosage of 1 tablet or 10 drops (tablets are to be slowly dissolved sublingually). Injection solutions are to be applied 1-2 times weekly. These dosages are also appropriate for follow-up treatment of acute disorders. We wish to emphasize, however, that the dosages recommended for the indicated preparations are presented as guidelines only. They are intended to aid less experienced therapists in homoeopathic/anti-homotoxic therapy. As experience increases, the majority of therapists adopt the practice of selecting the dosage for each case as individually as possible. Thus the experienced therapist considers not only the severity of the pathological process involved, but also the constitutional and reactive situations of each unique patient while determining the dosage and/or frequency of application optimal in the given case. 11.1 Dosage for infants and small children As for adults, dosage of homoeopathic medication in treating infants and small children is generally best determined on an individual basis. In light of the differing degrees of response these preparations evoke in each patient, designation of rigid dosage plans would neither be sensible nor would it correspond with our cognizance of anti-homotoxic therapy. Drops may be taken together with a small amount of liquid. Keeping the medication in the mouth for some time improves absorption and therefore the effectivity. Tablets should be taken sublingually. For infants and small children they may also be taken mixed with some liquid. The following dosages, determined through monitoring actual practice, have proven to provide reliable guidelines, however: Dosage for liquid preparations (drops): Age Group Normal Dosage Acute Dosage Infants 1 - 3x daily every half to every full hour 0 - 1 year 3 drops maximally 4 drops 10x daily Small children 1 - 3x daily every half to every full hour 1 - 6 years 5 drops maximally 6 drops 10x daily School children 1 - 3x daily every half to every full hour 6 - 12 years 7 drops maximally 10x daily, 8 drops Children from 12 years adult dosage adult dosage Dosage for tablet preparations: Age Group Normal Acute total Dosage Dosage acute Dosage Infants 2x daily every 1-2 hours, 4 tablets 0 -1 year 1/2 tablet take 1/2 tablet 8x daily maximally Small children 3x daily every 1-2 hours, 6 tablets 1 - 6 years 1/2 tablet take 1/2 tablet 12x daily maximally School children 2x daily every 1-2 hours, maximally 8 tablets 6 - 12 years 1 tablet take 1 tablet 8x daily Children adult adult adult from 12 years dosage dosage dosage Dosage for ampoule preparations of 1.1 ml: Age Group Normal Dosage Acute Dosage Infants 1x daily 0,3 ml 3x daily 0,3 ml 0 - 1 year (1/3 of the ampoule) Small children 1x daily 0,5 ml 3x daily 0,5 ml 1 - 6 years (1/2 of the ampoule) School children 1 x daily 0,7 ml 3 x daily 0,7 ml 6 - 12 years (2/3 of the ampoule) Children adult dosage adult dosage from 12 years Dosage for ampoule preparations of 2.2.ml: Age Group Normal Dosage Acute Dosage Infants 1x daily 0,7 ml 3x daily 0,7 ml 0 - 1 year (1/3 of the ampoule) Small children 1x daily 1,0 ml 3x daily 1,0 ml 1 - 6 years (1/2 of the ampoule) School children 1x daily 1,4 ml 3x daily 1,4 ml 6 - 12 years (2/3 of the ampoule) Children adult dosage adult dosage from 12 years Dosage for suppository preparations: Viburcol: Infants aged 1 day to 6 months receive up to 2 suppositories daily. Patients 6 months and older are given up to 3 suppositories per day. Vomitusheel S: Infants and children up to 6 months may receive a maximum dosage of 2 suppositories daily. The average, standard dosage of Spascupreel S suppositories consists of 1/2 suppository, 2 - 3 times daily for infants and 6 months of age. For children 6 months and older, the mean dosage is 1 suppository, 2 - 3 times per day. As a rule, Atropinum compositum S suppositories are to be administered to children having attained at least 3 months of age. Small children from 3 months to 3 years receive a maximum dosage of 1 suppository, 2 times daily; children 3 - 5 years of age are given a max. daily dosage of 3 suppositories; patients 5 years and older may be administered a maximum of 5 suppositories per day. 11.2 Information concerning allergies Artificial coloring None of the Heel preparations contain any artificial coloring. in Euphorbium compositum Nasal Spray S. Corn None of the Heel preparations contains any corn ingredients. Gluten Gluten is contained in Hepar forte. Glycerol Glycerol is contained in the mother and Injeel forte), all suis-organ preparations (please refer to page 35) and all nosodes (please refer to page 30). Therefore, small amounts of Glycerol are also contained in combination preparations with these ingredients (please refer to page 529). Lactose All tablet preparations contain Lactose (milk sugar). Magnesiumstearate All tablet preparations contain Magnesium stearate. Plant proteins Nearly all preparations contain plant extracts in potentized form and therefore also plant proteins (in non-hydrolyzed form). Please refer to the Pharmacological Index where for each preparation all source plants are listed in the composition. Soy None of the Heel preparations contains any soy ingredients. Sugar (sucrose) None of the Heel preparations contains any sugar/ sucrose. All tablets contain lactose (milk-sugar). Yeast None of the Heel preparations contains any yeast ingredients. 11.3 Selection of the appropriate preparations As a rule, the following procedure is to be observed in selecting the correct preparations for therapeutic application: Inasmuch as the Therapeutic Index or Pharmacological Index designates a medication with indications precisely corresponding to the syndrome involved, or for which homoeopathic drug-provings of its constituents exactly conform to the symptom picture as displayed by the patient, this preparation should be the principal therapeutic agent. In the presence of multifarious symptoms or in cases for which the appropriate remedy cannot be readily determined, the determination should be made according to the symptoms so that sometimes several preparations must be taken for alleviation of the various complaints, e.g., through parallel application of medications for relief of headache pain, cardiac disorders, venous stasis, arthralgia etc. When several preparations are prescribed simultaneously, these may be taken either individually (alternately, at intervals of one to two hours) or they may be consumed together. No change in the efficacy of preparations has been observed to occur on the grounds of simultaneous consumption to date. When preparations are available in a variety of dosage forms (e.g., as liquid drops and as tablets), these may generally be considered as equal in terms of therapeutic action. All drops contain ethanol in different amounts. As they are prepared employing aqueous alcohol solutions in accordance with the manufacturing directives of the HAB (German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia). Please refer to the Pharmacological Index where the exact amount to each preparation available as drops is listed in the composition. Usually, the amount of alcohol is negligible, as one dose of 10-15 drops contains only as little ethanol (0,13-0,45 g) as naturally contained in a slice of bread (0,1-0,2 g) or in half a glass of apple juice (0,5 g). Considering the natural degradation rate of 0,09-0,13 g ethanol per kg and hour, his amount of alcohol is degraded by the human body (of 60 kg) without 1-5 minutes. Nevertheless, discretion is advised in prescribing this form to patients in whom introduction of even slight quantities of alcohol might feasibly precipitate difficulties, such as to hepatopaths and dipsomaniacs - particularly in cases of \"dry\" alcoholics! Conversely, for patients suffering from the rare condition of lactose intolerance, tablet preparations are to be prescribed with due reservation only. Tablet preparations are not contraindicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus. In severe forms of this disease which require a strictly monitored carbohydrate diet, however, 0.025 BU (bread unit) is to be calculated per tablet (300 mg). 11.4 Special application of ampoule preparations The question of which method of application (oral or injection) is preferable for these preparations cannot be determined globally. During recent years, however, applicational studies have been conducted on numerous cases, providing therapeutic data on this question for a number of combination preparations. Evaluation of these investigational findings suggests therapeutic results achieved through the injection method to generally rank slightly higher than those attained by administration of the corresponding oral form. Due to diversified contributing factors among the documented cases (e.g., varying duration of symptoms, non-uniform adjuvant therapies, etc.), which presumably exerted considerable influence upon the degree of therapeutic success observed, these findings neither warrant designation as conclusive at present, nor shall they be universally applied to all preparations. In general, however, the form recommended for initial treatment of symptoms less severe in nature is that of oral application. Ampoule preparations are particularly appropriate for therapy of highly-acute pathological forms, or for chronic cases displaying disease pictures in which liquid-drop or tablet preparations have failed to produce a satisfactory degree of therapeutic success. A further, highly advisable measure, to be applied ensuing injection, consists of prescribing the corresponding oral form as follow-up therapy over an extended period of time. Children or patients who fear injections can also drink the ampoule preparation. For this purpose, the ampoules can be added to some tepid water and then drunk. When using a spoon, it should be ensured that it is not a metal spoon. The ampoule preparations may be divided into two basic categories: 1. Combination preparations (e.g., Composita remedies, Homaccords, combi- nation Injeels. (See chapter C, section 1, page 285.) 2. Single-Constituent preparations in potency chords (Injeels and Injeels forte) as well as in single potencies. (Refer to chapter C, section 2, page 439.) As in the case for drops and tablet preparations, the ampoule medications of the first category are to be employed in an indication-related manner (as far as possible). A great number of these remedies are also available as oral application, including drop preparations of each of the 30 Homaccords. The ampoule preparations of the second category (single-constituent remedies in potency chords, Injeels - including forte strengths - as well as single-constituent prepartations in single potencies) differ from those of the first group inasmuch as these medications contain only one homoeopathically-prepared base material each. The active constituent within such Injeel and Injeel-forte solutions is present in the form of what is termed a \"potency chord\": a mixture of potencies of the identical base substance at low, intermediate, and high levels of potentization. Experience has shown potency chords to broaden, deepen, and intensify the therapeutic effect of the corresponding agent. The high potencies contained in these chords also serve to mollify any initial worsening which may occur. The single-constituent Injeels/Injeels forte containing classic homoeopathic agents as active substances are primarily applied in accordance with homoeopathic drug provings. As a rule, the greatest efficacy is achieved in cases in which the patient's symptoms correspond as precisely as possible to the drug-proving data of the homoeopathic agent to be administered. It is also possible to administer a mixture of various Injeels, providing the drug-proving data for each individual preparation corresponds to any aspect of the patient's symptoms in a relevant manner. 11.5 Homoeopathically adjusted allopathic medications, intermediary catalysts, nosodes and suis-organ preparations: when to employ which remedy? For patients suffering from disorders previously treated by means of chemical medications, and for treating individuals whose compromised health is presumably ascribable to iatrogenic damage, the advisable mode of action consists of therapeutic administration of the appropriate homoeopathically-processed allopathic preparations in addition to the preparations which are otherwise indicated. Like the classic homoeopathic agents, these preparations are available in various forms: as Injeel, Injeel forte and some single-potencies. This type of remedy contains chemically-defined substances in homoeopathically potentized form; just as with all other homoeopathic agents, homoeopathically-processed allopathic medications are also to be applied in accordance with the similarity rule, \"similia similibus curentur.\" Homoeopathically adjusted allopathic drugs are prescribed on the basis of the following concept: in cases in which a certain medication was utilized for therapy of previous illnesses and thereby possibly caused iatrogenic damage, the organism is prompted to rehabilitate such damage through applying trace dosages of that pharmaceutical. This technique does not necessarily require applying the absolutely identical drug in homoeopathic attenuation which instilled the damage, but rather an active agent of a similar type may also be utilized. The intermediary catalysts are available as Injeels, forte-strength Injeels, and some as single potencies. These preparations contain homoeopathic potencies of substances which are significant for the normal metabolism of human cells and/or organs. Administration of these substances is intended to exert subliminal stimulation upon the metabolic processes in order to activate them and to re-establish blocked cellular and enzymal functions. Intermediary catalysts are primarily applied in treatment of chronic and degenerative diseases. Nosodes are preparations produced according to a homoeopathic processing technique from pathologically-altered organs or organic constituents of human or animal origin; further, from non-living cultures of micro-organisms, decomposition products of animal organs, as well as from bodily fluids containing pathogens or pathological products which are no longer virulent. Nosodes are likewise available as Injeels, forte-strength Injeels and some as single-potencies. Nosodes are most aptly designated as \"terrain remedies.\" Their action does not directly target the pathogens themselves, but is capable of improving the organism's defensive situation with the result of definitively overcoming infection or the damage sustained due to such infection. Nosodes are generally applied as follow-up therapy ensuing abatement of the acute stage of infection or infectious disease (corresponding to application in accordance with anamnestic, etiological similarity). They may also be administered in accordance with symptomatic similarity, however, (reflecting the fundamental homoeopathic rules of similitude) e.g., in treatment of patients lacking definitive evidence of previous affection yet displaying symptoms similar to those of a certain illness. The suis-organ preparations are available as Injeels, forte-strength Injeels, and some as single-potencies. Suis-organ preparations are employed for organ-specific stimulation therapy. These medications are particularly successful in treatment of degenerative damage as well as functional insufficiency of the organs. As a rule, preliminary therapy is initially performed employing the indicated disease-specific homoeopathic combination-preparation, subsequent to which the organ-related suis-organ preparation is then applied, either unaccompanied or in combination with further homoeopathic medications as required. A frequent observation made upon applying mixtures of suis-organ preparations with other homoeopathic agents has been the directive capacity the former seems to exert over the latter. The suis-organ preparations apparently \"guide\" other active homoeopathic substances in their presence to the corresponding targeted organ, thereby intensifying their efficacy. 11.6 Higher potencies (Injeels) or lower potencies (Injeels forte)? And recommendations for Injeels (including homoeopathically-processed allopathics, catalysts, nosodes, and available in two strengths: as Injeels and Injeels forte. In certain cases these may also be obtained in single-potency, high and/or low-potency forms as well (see chapter C, section 2, page 439). The following statement provides information regarding the applicational possibilities of these preparations in their various strengths: In cases in which the patient's individual reactive status is not precisely known, it is recommended to commence therapy by applying the normal-strength Injeels. As the stimulative effects of this form are comparatively the most mild, the jeopardy of violent initial reactions may virtually be ruled out. It is advisable to treat chronic affections primarily by means of the higher potencies, with the lower potencies (forte Injeels and low single-potencies) employed only in the confirmed event of poor response. Patients whose reactive status is extremely sensitive may display slight signs of initial exacerbation even upon receiving the normal Injeels. In cases such as this, renewed application should be delayed until the reaction has subsided. Then a high single-potency of the corresponding agent (as far as available) is to be subsequently applied in order to \"test\" the patient's individual reactive threshold. In treatment of acutely occurring, severe symptoms in all patients excepting those who react in a particularly sensitive manner, lower potencies (forte Injeels) may also be applied from the beginning of therapy. The Injeel forms are then to be administered as improvement progresses. 11.7 How are Injeel and Injeel-forte preparations applied? Injeels, Injeels forte, and single potencies are to be administered hypodermically by means of either intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intracutaneous injection. In principle, intravenous injection should always be performed with due caution while attentive observation is focused upon the patient. This is particularly true when an agent is applied to a subject for the first time, as the possibility of allergic reaction may never be completely ruled out, even to constituents in such greatly-attenuated form as are found with homoeopathic medications. However, intravenous application of a preparation may well be indicated in treating acute symptoms, as the medication takes effect most rapidly through this mode. Drug monitorings have shown the degree of therapeutic success achieved for certain combination preparations to improve when administered intravenously. Here, the rate of successful therapy achieved by i.v. application was higher than that attained through i.m., s.c., or i.d. administration of the same preparation. Intramuscular injection takes effect more gradually than intravenous application. The effects of i.m. injection are extremely long-lasting, however. Subcutaneous injection is frequently observed to take extremely rapid action when applied within the region of pain or at an acupuncture point. When applied to other areas, s.c. injection takes effect in a manner comparable to that of intramuscular injection. Intracutaneous injection is indicated for treating painful conditions, particularly when neural effects are desired. The wheals are applied segmentally and neurally within the region of pain, or to either the left or right of the vertebral column in correspondence with the affected segment (e.g., at the starting points of the intercostal nerves); a further possible location is above the vertebrae themselves. In this technique, all the ampoule preparations indicated for treatment of the existing syndrome may be combined within a single syringe and subsequently injected in several large wheals along the vertebral column (paravertebral application). Numerous therapists also prescribe the oral ingestion of Heel ampoule preparations on occasion. The patient is hereby instructed to empty the ampoule's contents into a glass, dilute with water, and to swallow the resulting mixture in small sips. It is due to this mode of administration as prescribed by certain therapists that the term \"ampoule for oral ingestion\" is occasionally utilized. 11.8 Therapy of cases progressing in an unusual manner Occasionally, application of homoeopathic preparations is initially accompanied by slight exacerbation, excessive reaction, or a therapeutic crisis, such as is also known to occur in balneology (a reaction to hydrotherapy marked by brief initial worsening of symptoms). This reaction may generally be deemed harmless and subsides, as a rule, unaided. It may also come to pass, however, that a new symptom picture begins to develop after employing homoeopathic preparations, making an adjustment in medications necessary. In such cases, symptoms typical for homoeopathic drug-proving may be observed to develop and can be identified in certain instances. Here, the corresponding homoeopathic agent identified in this manner is to be applied in its Injeel (or perhaps Injeel-forte) form. Further, a combination preparation possessing the agent in question as an individual constituent is also appropriate for application here. A phenomenon frequently observed during homoeopathic therapy is an increase in activity of the eliminatory processes. This may be expressed as heightened discharge of secretory matter, elevated quantities of urinary voiding, etc. By and large, such manifestations are to be viewed as signs of a favorable prognosis, signalizing the successful evacuation of pathogenic substances (homotoxins). Even upon development of eliminatory processes which would normally be evaluated as pathological (e.g., leukorrhea, fistula ruptures etc.), these may nevertheless be indications that the self-healing powers within the body have become activated and are deploying these modes of elimination (or compensation phases) to rid the organism of affection-causing toxic substances. These compensation phases function as \"biological escape valves\" and are virtually identical with emergency exits,\" by Prof. Dr. J. K\u00fchnau, director of the Institute of Physiological Chemistry at the University of Hamburg, Germany; see Metabolic Competition\"). Any possible action intended to hinder these processes through suppressive measures, therefore, must be thoroughly considered to determine whether such action is absolutely indispensable or not. This is also true in cases displaying febrile reaction, as may occasionally occur during homoeopathic therapy. Providing the current affection has inflicted no irreparable damage to a patient's organs (as yet), appropriate therapy - applied over a sufficient period of time - is frequently successful in restoring that individual to a completely healthy condition. One method of determining a subject's current status of rehabilitation is to monitor the reactions which are still observable upon administrating the indicated preparations. Distinct initial reactions on application of the therapeutically-indicated preparation are frequently an indication that the currently-existing symptom-picture still requires relatively prolonged and intensive therapy. Conversely, at stages in which rehabilitation is already quite advanced, no reactions are observable at all (or of a rudimentary nature at most), even upon application the Injeels, nosodes, suis-organ preparations, etc., in their forte-strength forms. In cases in which organs or tissues have sustained irreversible, degenerative alteration, permanent cure is not to be anticipated, even through homoeopathic stimulation therapy. Nevertheless, applying preparations indicated in accordance with the patient's symptom-complex may prove beneficial even in such cases. As these measures activate the organism's detoxicating system, the body is enabled to deal more effectively with the toxic substances (homotoxins) generated as a consequence of the disease with which it is afflicted. As mentioned above, the removal of homotoxins is again noticeable in the form of intensified eliminatory processes. In the majority of cases, an improvement in the patient's general sense of well-being becomes apparent simultaneously with the onset of this eliminatory enhancement; both of these occurrences may be taken as an indication of the patient responding well to the selected preparations. It is thus advisable to continue applying, over an extensive period, those preparations with such a positive response. Although the primary disease cannot be cured through these measures, it is nevertheless possible in many cases to extensively rid the organism of further harmful pathological toxins, thereby improving the quality of the patient's life while simultaneously retarding the course of the afflicting disease. 11.9 Shelf-life and storage of Heel preparations Kept under proper storage conditions, Heel preparations remain imperishable for five years. Products bearing an expiration date should not be used beyond the indicated date. Drop solutions stored over lengthy intervals are to be agitated several times prior to use. All preparations in every form of supply are to be shielded from excessively high temperatures and direct sunlight. Tablet medications require additional protection from humidity and dampness. Under no circumstances are suppository preparations to be stored at temperatures exceeding 30\u00b0C, as this results in softening or melting of the suppository mass. Even temporary exposure to such temperatures is to be carefully avoided. B Therapeutic Index Preface Like homoeotherapy, antihomotoxic therapy is a stimulant therapeutic technique based on excitation through medicinal means. The majority of the individual homoeopathic agents contained within antihomotoxic preparations were selected on the grounds of homoeopathic trials conducted on healthy human beings and included as constituents of the corresponding remedies in accordance with the Law of Similars: \"Similia similibus curentur - Likes cure like\". Antihomtoxic preparations provide a form of therapy which activates the body's intrinsic self-healing powers in addition to cleansing the organism of toxic deposits (homotoxins) via natural eliminatory channels. These medications can frequently restore insufficient organs to normal function while accelerating the patient's rehabilitation from acute affection and providing long-term alleviation of symptoms, even in illnesses which are chronic or recurrent in nature. In such cases in which the organism's self-healing powers are exhausted, however, or in the presence of genuine tissue-destruction (including fibrous degeneration and irreparable processes due to old age), the therapist should not hesitate to make use of the possibilities of chemotherapy, antibiotic therapy and/or substitutional therapy available to us today. Even when such harsh treatment as this is required, antihomotoxic preparations serve as excellent supplementation, allowing the organism to take advantage of every last opportunity for self-regulation. In cases in which the existing clinical picture necessitates medical examinations of a routine and/or specialized nature, these are naturally to be performed at regular intervals under antihomotoxic therapy as well. Under the heading of each disease, this therapeutic index generally designates a number of oral preparations. As a rule, rapid therapeutic success is achieved through initially administering these remedies orally, either simultaneously or alternating at one-hour intervals. Each of the preparations designated in this index is generally followed by a listing of certain hours of the day. This is provided as a guideline regarding the intervals at which the corresponding preparation is to be taken. The indicated medications may also be applied simultaneously or in rapid succession of one another. Providing the patient has sufficient time at his or her disposal, preference should be given to the method of alternate application. Conversely, for patients whose time-schedules will not allow administration in the preferred manner (due to occupation, school etc.), it is generally more expedient to prescribe the various indicated remedies to be taken simultaneously. As a rule, no alteration in the preparations' action or efficacy is to be anticipated due to simultaneous consumption. A further alternative consists of initial, exclusive application of the preparation(s) determined as principal agent(s). Quite often, successful treatment is achieved through employing these medications alone. According to the manner in which the symptom-complex then continues its course (i.e. the alteration in phases occurring through vicariation), the initially-applied agent may either be replaced by a different remedy or supplemented by additional preparations as required. Every severe or therapeutically resistant case should also receive therapy by means of injection whenever practicable. Here, the recommended procedure consists of \"covering\" the entire symptom-complex through the appropriate ampoule preparations via hypodermic application. Should the symptom-complex conform to one of the known homoeopathic drug-proving pictures, however, employment of the corresponding single-remedy medication (injeel or injeel-forte) generally suffices to produce the desired results. Further suggestions on the development of individualised therapeutic plans may be found in section 3 of the introduction entitled \"General Rules for the Practical Therapeutic Application of Heel Preparations\" (page 65).

Alternative phases In this case it is mainly a matter of excretion or reaction phases, but also impregnation, degeneration and deposition phases can appear or reappear as preliminary phases of a neoplasm phase. In all comparatively harmless ailments of later life it must be borne in mind that an alternative phase could be involved, as a therapeutical inhibition of such albus, suppurating fistulae, etc., sometimes leads to the appearance of a latent degeneration or dedifferentiation phase, e.g. checking furunculosis in a diabetic patient can lead rapidly to a serious coma diabeticum. The most important therapeutic agent for alternative phases is Galium-Heel .

See also psychic symptoms, depression, delirium tremens, arteriosclerosis, schizoid conditions, etc. Dermatitis, dermatoses Psorinoheel ) Acute dermatitis is mainly to be interpreted as the responsive action to an exogenous or endogenous homotoxin, frequently of an allergic type, i.e. of retoxic causation, in which the histamine, active in the inflammation (reaction phases), due to the nonbiological inhibition of the reaction phase, was not decomposed and eliminated (by secretion processes, desquamation, etc.), but in the form of an allergy (allos ergos = other action, e.g. that of the histamine on other tissue of another cell-layer), took effect at other loci. The skin is one of the most important reaction organs (elimination through the skin). Therefore, these cases of acute allergic dermatitis should in no way be treated retoxically as otherwise serious passive poisoning or conversion to chronic forms is inevitable. For acute dermatitis the following are administered: Belladonna-Homaccord 8-10 drops at 8 a.m., 12 noon and 4 p.m. Apis-Homaccord 8-10 drops at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. possibly both preparations taken together 2-4-6 times daily.

This process corresponds to an impregnation effect. In the case of scars, the resultant circulatory disturbances also have an impregnating effect. The consequent disorders correspond to focal toxicoses (reflexes as described by Reilly, Speransky and Ricker). The removal of such a focus is indicated, e.g. by tooth extraction. As the tonsils, as a result of repeated retoxic treatment of tonsillitis, can also exhibit such impregnation foci, extirpation may also be indicated. Here, however, possibilities are offered of provoking regressive vicariation (tonsillitis), by means of which such impregnation phases in the tonsils can be disintegrated and cured. It should be attempted in every case to achieve these regressive vicariations and to effect a cure by means of the following prescription.

As principal remedies, Galium-Heel and Traumeel S are appropriate per os and i.v., possibly in addition, Psorinoheel (migraine, skin diseases) as well as Engystol N (i.v., i.m. ) The progressive auto-sanguis therapy is always particularly effective with suitable ampoule preparations and Suis-organ preparations. See under the individual indications.Further, the use of suitable Nosode preparations is important, when, in particular, Grippe-Nosode-Injeel and Granuloma dentis-Injeel are frequently indicated, since numerous impregnation phases have arisen from the retoxic treatment of acute reaction phases or have originated from foci (fields of disturbance). Several of Heel's Composita preparations are excellently suited for the treatment of impregnation phases of all kinds. In impregnation phases the enzymes are always more or less blocked, when possibly (especially with the continuous use of analgesics, soporifics, antibiotics, bactericides, etc.,) there is a transition to the degeneration phases. Since a more or less pronounced liver damage is also always present (in addition to damage to the connective tissue as well as to the other organs of the main defensive system, e.g. the mechanism of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland and the cortex of the suprarenal gland, bone marrow, etc.), the following treatment is recommended, particularly in the case compositum or Ovarium compositum (for women), to be administered every 2-3 days, alternating. When some reactions occur, the mixed and single remedy Injeels and Homaccords (including oral) adapted to the symptomatology are administered at intervals, in particular also Galium-Heel , Lymphomyosot , Psorinoheel (orally and parenterally) and possibly Engystol N . It is essential to be quite clear that after each injection the underlying homotoxic substrate undergoes a change which, in impregnation phases which have come to a standstill, however, owing to enzyme damage, always occurs in about the same intermediary homotoxin material, so that (as in general in the cellular phases) each preparation which has proved to be effective must usually be administered over a fairly long period. Especially in the impregnation phases extensive possibilities of a cure still exist, i.e. reactivation of the disturbed enzyme functions. Of course, it is essential to advise the patient seriously to pursue a biologically correct mode of life and diet, since (especially in later life) a certain locus minoris resistance remains, which reappears when there is over-burdening with poisons (exogenous intake of toxins, as from tobacco, alcohol, sutoxins, etc.) In this case the danger always exists, especially when allopathic preparations are used, that the latent impregnation phase may then be converted unexpectedly into a progressive vicariation, into the degeneration or even neoplasm phase.

Infectious diseases (Reaction phases) Infectious organisms can become established and flourish only on suitable homotoxic terrain. On the other hand, numerous potentially pathogenic micro-organisms exist as saprophytes frequently in close symbiosis with the human organism (oral cavity, intestine, etc.). The organism frequently makes use of pathogenic bacteria as auxiliary factors in decomposing and eliminating homotoxic material through the reaction phase. In the case of serious homotoxic strain it can, however, certainly be indicated for the purpose of avoiding fulminating sepsis, that penicillin and other antibiotics should be administered. This should apply only to exceptional cases, however, particularly as most infectious diseases respond to biotherapeutics and antihomotoxic agents (usually, also, in a considerably shorter time), ending in a complete cure, i.e., in the course of the infectious reaction phases, the homotoxic material is detoxicated and eliminated (pus, mucus, etc.) For general therapy, the following are suitable: Belladonna-Homaccord every hour to two hours, 8-10 drops, later 3-4 times daily.

Pain (Impregnation phases) A biotherapeutic agent effective in general against pain of all kinds does not exist, since pain is the expression of the fact that (according to the type of pain), various or varying homotoxins are acting on various neural receptors in the form of impregnation phases. The administration of analgesics does not improve the homotoxin level; on the contrary, it is usually worsened by additional retoxic effects or an impregnation action, i.e., it is not influenced causally. Through the administration of the biotherapeutic agent indicated according to the syndrome, the homotoxin level underlying the cause of the pain is influenced (curative effect). Every antihomotoxic-biotherapeutic agent can, therefore, act indirectly as an analgesic. The preparations described briefly below are frequently indicated, care being taken to ensure that these are not taken in a single dose but that they are administered frequently in sequence (8-10 drops every 5-10 min. or 1 tablet allowed to dissolve on the tongue, not swallowed with water).

Veterinary medicine Animal diseases react to Heel biotherapeutical and antihomotoxic agents with visible success, the objections occasionally raised being invalidated, i.e. that in the application of high dilution medicaments the effect is based predominantly on suggestion. The indications and methods of administration are the same as in human medicine. Viral diseases (These relate always to impregnation phases, as the penetration of the virus into the cell is a typical example of an impregnation effect.) In the cell, the virus can remain in an eclipsed stage for an indefinite period. The true phenomena of the viral disease appear only when the virus multiplies in the cell, destroying it, i.e. when the visible struggle of the organism with the virus takes place. The intracellular virus phase appears, therefore, as regressive vicariation in the stage of the reaction phase and becomes accessible to therapy.

China (Peruvian bark) Remedy for debility, in gangrene, sural spasms, polyneuritis, ischaemia, (condurango bark) Cachexia, tumors of the mucous positive findings of lactic the individual homoeopathic constituents of Arsuraneel, therapeutic possibilities result for the treatment of dyscrasia, eczema, particularly chronic, lichen ruber, pruritus of various locations and origins, cachectic conditions, including when, in addition, physical deterioration sets in, with acute or chronic diseases (with psychological depression, e.g. in renal colic). Arsuraneel is indicated for all serious toxin levels, including after dietary errors and the consumption of harmful foods, when a shift of electrolytes takes place (e.g. consecutive renal calculus formation and colic), regardless of whether the diseases are acute (e.g. sepsis) or chronic. The antihomotoxic reversal effect of Arsenicum is then revealed especially clearly when the patient himself expresses the fear that he may never again become healthy. The additional prescription of Arsuraneel, however, is to be considered always, in every case of serious cellular phases which tend (not as with Galium-Heel to neoplasm formation, but) to malignant breakdown, to gangrene, phlegmonous extension, etc. Arsuraneel is also indicated, therefore, in particular when biologically desirable vicariation sets in, as is the case when intracellular enzyme mechanisms are reactivated. The previously disturbed detoxication recommences. The intermediary homotoxins thereby put into solution or released must, through the massive attack of inflammatory processes (reaction phase), be decomposed, which is identical to the occurrence of abscesses, angina or the recurrence of the acute phases of old foci. In such cases, Arsuraneel is given in massive initial-dose therapy, possibly with Cruroheel S and Bryaconeel. In many cases Arsuraneel acts suddenly, e.g. in skin diseases with pruritus, chronic otitis media (in addition to Cruroheel S, Traumeel S, etc.). The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the symptoms and the stage of the illness: 1 tablet 2-4 times daily, if necessary with the alternating remedies also indicated. For serious disorders brief massive initial-dose therapy, e.g. 1 tablet to be dissolved on the tongue 2-4 times every 15 minutes. Arteria-Heel\u00ae Drops Peripheral circulatory disorders.

Due to the heart and liver extract, molecular components are made available for disturbed organ functions, as well as antihomotoxic effects for disorders of these organs being achieved in the form of the simile effect. The plant extracts, primarily, provide a cardiac tonic and normalize the disturbed circulation, while, by means of Glonoinum and other constituents, the important regulation of the myocardial circulation, with a reduction of myocardial damage, is achieved, which mechanism is simultaneously supported by the catalysts of the citric acid cycle. In particular, a predisposition towards infarction is not only averted by means of g-strophanthin but also with the aid of the other constituents, especially Acidum sarcolacticum, when, in the simile and reversal effect, the acidification in the regions of the myocardium where the circulation is poor, is lowered.

Silicea (silicic acid) Weakness of the connective tissue and veins, oedema calf muscels, tendency to cold feet. Based on the individual homoeopathic constitutents of Cruroheel S, therapeutic possibilities result for the treatment of fistulation. Effective action is found in bone affections and fistular suppurations, especially after pre-treatment with Osteoheel S, e.g. in thoracic empyema with fistulation. Also in the case of sports injuries in the region of the legs (but also generally), Cruroheel S, in addition to Traumeel S ointment externally and Traumeel S liquid internally, has proved excellent, e.g. for contusions, strains, rupture of muscles, as well as fractures. Also in cases of venous stasis and circulatory disorders in the region of the leg, as well as to improve the circulation of the blood in crural ulcers and varicose eczema, Cruroheel S is indicated, and likewise as additional remedy for rosacea and alopecia. Cruroheel S comes to mind for all reaction phases of the connective tissue which occur in the vicinity of osseous, cartilaginous or tendinous structures, empyema, empyema of the gall etc.); in general, for all serious toxin levels. Cruroheel S has proved to be especially efficacious also in alleviating the serious onset of regressive vicariation, when, for example, after regeneration of the intracellular enzymes (by means of Acidum N , etc.), the physiological detoxication mechanisms again become functional, whereby, through the reaction phases, the intermediary homotoxins should be decomposed and detoxicated. Then, in addition to Cruroheel S, in particular Traumeel S tablets, Arsuraneel and possibly Bryaconeel are prescribed. Cutis defensive system in cases to ammonium bitumen sulphate.

By means of homoeopathic remedies, the action of which is directed specifically at reaction phases and septic clinical pictures, also in viral diseases, a broad antihomotoxic reversal effect is achieved in the most varied reaction phases, also with the aid of nosodes and trace elements, particularly when, in regressive vicariation, serious inflammation occurs; in such cases Traumeel S, Engystol N and Hepar compositum (stimulation of the detoxicating hepatic function) may be administered as alternating injections. In feverish reaction phases, in general the usual form of Echinacea compositum S is administered. However, serious toxin levels with sepsis, chronic infections, primary chronic polyarthritis, and in particular precancerous dermatosis and neoplasia, so long as they can still be treated, require a considerable strengthening of the Echinacea components. In these cases, therefore, Echinacea compositum forte S is administered. In the cellular phases there is frequently a blockage of the defensive system. In addition, because of the disturbance of the fermentative detoxication mechanisms, there is a continual attack by intermediary homotoxins which, for their part, are responsible for secondary syndromes and symptoms of toxic origin. In this case, massive initial-dose therapy (Spitzy) with stimulating drugs is necessary, especially in degeneration and neoplasm phases. In order to stimulate the defensive system fundamentally and at the same time reopen the valvular functions which may have been obstructed, it is beneficial to administer increasing doses according to the following plan: On the 1st day: 1/2 ampoule Echinacea compositum Echinacea compositum Echinacea compositum Echinacea compositum ampoules Echinacea compositum forte S; on the 6th and 7th days the treatment should be omitted. Then possibly only every second day one i.v. injection should be administered; later, only once weekly. If the fever occurring after the usual intravenous injection of Echinacea compositum forte S has not subsided by the following midday, a day free from medicaments is inserted as early as after the first i.v. injection, in order to allow the defensive system time to react. Further, it can then be ascertained whether the therapeutic fever which may occur is to be regarded merely as a transitory intermediate reaction or whether a general feverish detoxicating reaction on a broad basis has been provoked, as the inflammation is a major, biologically important and, in the case of serious toxication, irreplaceable detoxication reaction. In this way (in the form of regressive vicariation: Reckeweg), even degenerative phases and possibly even neoplasia in reaction phases can be reversed and influenced favourably or even cured. It is certainly not necessary for favourable regressive vicariations to manifest themselves exclusively as a fever. In the case of a persistent fever continuing for weeks, in addition to Echinacea compositum forte S, 1 ampoule i.v. every 2-3 days, also interpolated injections of Engystol N and Traumeel S and possibly of Gripp-Heel are beneficial. In addition, detoxication of the liver by Hepeel , etc., and elimination through the gastro-intestinal canal each. Indications: To activate the non-specific defensive mechanism, particularly in cases of influenza and questionable virus diseases. Dosage: Injection solution: In acute disorders 1 ampoule daily, otherwise 3-1 times weekly i.m., s.c., i.d., i.v. Tablets: In general, 1 tablet to be dissolved under the tongue 3-1 times daily. Package sizes: Tablets: Packs containing 50 and 250 tablets. Injection solution: Packs containing 5, 10, 50 and 100 ampoules of 1.1 ml. Pharmacological and clinical notes Vincetoxicum hirundinaria (swallowwort) Stimulation of the body's own defenses with vascular and sympathetic action, e.g. in feverish viral diseases such as influenza, mumps, etc. Sulfur (sulphur) Reagent in all diseases; cellular activity is influenced catalytically. Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Engystol N , therapeutic possibilities result for the activation of the body's own non-specific defenses, particularly in vague feverish infections and for influenza, as well as after Roentgen irradiation and generally in viral infections of all kinds, viral influenza, viral pneumonia and viral hepatitis, as well as after vaccination (against smallpox), also stomatitis aphthosa. Many the respiratory organs (bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pertussis, pneumonia and asthma), of the heart and circulation (paroxysmal tachycardia, endocarditis). Migraine, neuralgia, causalgia. Allergies of every kind and location (including hay fever) and various forms of rheumatism (including gout), diseases of the kidneys, liver and central nervous system. Experimentally in toxoplasmosis (together with Traumeel S i.v.). Impregnation and degeneration phases in the form of therapeutical damage (in addition to the intermediary acids of the citric acid cycle). Engystol N exerts a generally lowering action on high homotoxin levels, especially after therapeutical damage with the presence of impregnation and possibly also degeneration phases, particularly also in virus diseases, which are characterised by the penetration of the virus (homotoxin) into the cell. Here Engystol N has no direct virostatic or virocidal effect. The effect of Engystol rests, rather, on the vincetoxin which acts similarly to aconitine, and on the asclepiadic acid (constituent of Vincetoxicum officinale), with action on the vessels and sympathetic nervous system, as well as depending on colloidal sulphur, through which, by unblocking disturbed enzyme functions (sulphide enzymes), a general non-specific stimulation of the major defensive system takes place and the way is cleared for a far-reaching detoxication. Engystol N , consequently, exercises (in a similar way to Lymphomyosot ), also a channelling action on the whole mesenchyma, and particularly on the lymphatic system. This forms the foundation also for the indications of Engystol N for allergies, secondary diseases and sequelae (such as agranulocytosis, neuritis, impairment of the liver, kidneys, bone marrow and myocardium; nephritis, etc.). In serious feverish reaction phases, e.g. sepsis, after Engystol N occasionally, at first, there is a slight worsening lasting from 3-5 hours, followed by a compensatory curative phase. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: 1 ampoule i.m., s.c., i.v. 1-3 times weekly, possibly together with the patient's own blood. For viral diseases 1 ampoule i.v. daily; for small children and infants i.m. or s.c. until an improvement is observed. For influenza, mixed injections (1 ampoule i.m., possibly with the patient's own blood) together with Gripp-Heel (possibly 2 ampoules) and Traumeel S. Erigotheel\u00ae 3-1 times weekly i.m., s.c., i.d., i.v. Package sizes: Packs containing 5, 10, 50 and 100 ampoules of 1.1 ml. Pharmacological and clinical notes the individual homoeopathic constituents of Erigotheel, therapeutical possibilities result for the treatment of ventricular and duodenal ulcers, hyperacidity, parapyloric syndrome according to Strauss = irritation triad: hyperaesthesis, supersecretion and hypermotility of the stomach. As the bitter principles contained in both components of the preparation are able to increase the excitability of the sympathetic nervous system, the effect of Erigotheel is essentially conditioned by the indirect alleviation of the vagotonia caused by the stimulation of the antagonistic sympathetic nervous system. In addition to a mild spasmolysis, Erigotheel leads to a biological regulation of the secretory function of the gastroduodenal mucosa, creating the necessary physiological conditions for curing an ulcer, which are also of great significance in preventing recurrent ulcers. Also chronic ulcers and the dumping syndrome can be favourably influenced therapeutically by Erigotheel. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: Erigotheel is advantageously administered over a fairly long period, during which 3 injections (i.m., s.c., i.v.) are given weekly in the form of segmental therapy, in the skin of the right side of the epigastrium, or paravertebrally. In acute disorders or as initial treatment, daily injections for several days. Combination with Traumeel S in an i.v. or i.m. mixed injection enhances the therapeutical success. For particularly therapy-resistant cases it is recommended, in addition to an Erigotheel-Traumeel S mixed injection to be administered every 2 days i.v. or i.m., on the intervening days to administer 1 ampoule of Erigotheel in the hyperesthetic zones in the form of wheals or injected s.c. The additional oral therapeutic agent is Duodenoheel (1 tablet 3 times daily); in chronic cases Anacardium-Homaccord ; where there is a suspicion of precancerous state, Galium-Heel , etc. sinus, ethmoidal sinus, sphenoid sinus), catarrh of the ear passages, dropsy of the middle ear.

Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Euphorbium compositum, therapeutical possibilities result with drops and injection solution for the treatment of acute and chronic sinusitis (maxillary, frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal), as well as of tubal catarrh (ear) and of dropsy of the middle ear. Nasal spray (dosing spray) for chronic dry nasal catarrh, mucosa in chronic sinusitis; to respiration in and allergic coryza (hay fever); for acute nasal catarrh and catarrh caused by a chill (dissolves the secretions, ensures free nasal respiration and relieves frontal pressure); as auxiliary remedy for atrophic rhinitis (ozena). The preparation, which is available as drops to be taken as well as in the form of injection solution, has shown excellent effects in an extensive series of tests, especially for chronic sinusitis, and particularly the dry form (atrophy of the nasal mucous membrane), bringing about reactivation and, in the form of regressive vicariation, restoring the lubrication of the mucosa. Occasionally it is beneficial, at the same time to administer also the preparation Mucosa compositum, after a fairly long use of caustics, after ointments which reduce mucus, etc., also the preparations which act effectively on the enzymes, Coenzyme compositum , Ubichinon compositum ; for inflammatory S (possibly forte i.v.) or Traumeel N . Also for aphonia, Euphorbium compositum injection solution has proved effective in S, Mucosa compositum and Ubichinon compositum . of the middle ear and for chronic otitis, all 3 forms of medicament should be administered simultaneously. Euphorbium compositum-\u00d1asal Spray S stimulates the mucosal functions, their action being directed especially towards the nose and paranasal sinuses, having a regulatory effect on the widest variety of diseases of the mucosa of the sinuses, including acute and allergic coryza. Avoiding the otherwise usual deturgescence of the mucosa, and without reactive hyperaemia with the consequent constriction of the respiratory tract, the nasal mucous membrane alone is cleansed from crusts and secretions by the solvent (physiological salt solution). Irksome desiccation is avoided, free respiration ensured and the unpleasant frontal pressure dispelled. In addition, the administration of Euphorbium compositum-Nasal Spray S over a fairly long period does not bring about a decrease in their action, but on the contrary, this is increased with time.

Glyoxal compositum contains methyl glyoxal and oxalaldehyde which, according to Professor W. Frederik Koch, have a far-reaching action on the widest variety of degenerative diseases. According to Professor Koch, methyl glyoxal and oxalaldehyde, as members of what is known as the carbonyl group series, have the property of deblocking blocked energy-producing systems of the cells, as well, by way of depolymerization of homotoxins and carcinotoxins, as dissolving a cancerous formation already in progress, by means of the action of the free radicals, which is possible both through quinones and through free carbonyl groups. In this way, through the free carbonyl groups and quinones, by means of hydrogen removal, the impregnation phase, to some extent, is broken up therapeutically. It has proved beneficial, in treatment with Glyoxal compositum, succession. Also Hepar compositum (stimulation of the detoxicating hepatic function) can be interposed advantageously, while in cases of powerful regressive vicariation and the appearance of inflammatory symptoms, Traumeel S and Echinacea compositum S are indicated. Cancer therapy is based, among other preparations, on Viscum in alternating injections every 1-2 days. Glyoxal compositum, in general, should be interposed only when improvement flags.

Homaccords are particularly suited to the treatment of chronic diseases, since, in addition to the low potencies, also high potencies of the basic materials are included in the remedial mixture, resulting in a balanced potency and amplifying and heightening the therapeutic effect, as well as imparting sustained, increased intensity. Owing to the inclusion of both relatively high and maximum potencies in the remedy, possible preliminary reactions are moderated. After administration of Homaccords, therefore, hardly ever, or only on very rare occasions are early changes for the worse observed. All Homaccords can be administered intermixed, or in alternation or mixed with other peroral and ampoule remedies of the Heel biotherapeutics. The basic potencies of the individual constituents of the ampoule preparations of the Homaccord range are, in general, 2-3 potencies higher than in the liquid remedies. The Homaccords are arranged alphabetically in this index. NB. For the prescription, it is recommended that possible abbreviations for \"Homaccord\" should be agreed with the dispensing chemist (HA, Hcd, Hom, etc.) In the balanced potencies, the individual degrees of potency, even when blended together, maintain their independent action, so that there is no immediate averaging of the different potencies.

In the Cellular phases, it is beneficial to administer also a Suis-organ preparation in admixture, e.g. Uterus suis-Injeel (forte), Ovarium suis-Injeel (forte). The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: In acute disorders 1 ampoule daily, otherwise 1 ampoule once to 3 times weekly i.v., i.m., s.c. (with the patient's own blood), i.d. (neurally at the os sacrum).

Pharmacological and clinical notes Natrium molybdaenicum (sodium molybdate) Important trace (Schardinger enzyme). cells and tissue fluids; important for the normal course of numerous metabolic processes (prosthetic group of asparaginicum intracellular cation; activates the widest variety of enzyme systems, influences ossification processes, the metabolism of the musculature, membrane permeability and erythropoiesis. Ferrum fumaricum (iron fumarate) Vital component of the organism, i.e. in enzymes, e.g. cytochrome oxydase, catalase and peroxidase; further, in haemoglobin, myoglobin and in the cytochromes; in the iron-fumaric acid compound, with the function of the citric acid cycle as the special objective. Cobaltum gluconicum (cobalt gluconate) Especially as Cerium aspartate) influence on the respiration of the epidermal cells; promotion of the defensive mechanism against infection. Cuprum sulfuricum (copper sulphate) Contributory effect in haemoglobin action, catalytic action in redox processes and in enzyme systems, cramp of the smooth and striped muscles. Niccolum aceticum (nickel acetate) Similar action to manganese, cobalt stimulation of blood coagulation. Rubidium chloratum (rubidium chloride) Similar action to potassium; promotes the liberation of adrenalin; promotes the functioning of some enzymes (dehydrogenase, acetyl phosphatase). Sulfur (sulphur) Reagent in activity is influenced catalytically. Phosphorus (phosphorus) Remedy for affections of the parenchyma; damage to the liver parenchyma. Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Molybd\u00e4n compositum, therapeutical possibilities result for the regulation of the mineral balance. By means of Molybd\u00e4n compositum, therefore, an influence is exerted on the mineral equilibrium and, indeed, on deficient enzyme regulation and enzyme blocking. This effect is intensified by the mutual amplification of the individual constituents according to B\u00fcrgi's principle, i.e. through the combination effect of molybdenum, zinc, magnesium, iron, cobalt, cerium, potassium, manganese, copper, nickel, rubidium, sulphur and phosphorus, when the coupling to organic acids (aspartic acid, gluconic acid, fumaric acid, etc.) favours the channelling into the cells or into the region of the enzymes. The action of Molybd\u00e4n compositum is strengthened by preparations which act upon enzymes, such as Coenzyme compositum and Ubichinon compositum , also by Composita-Heel, etc., which are directed towards similar dysfunctions. The action of all biotherapeutic agents is intensified to some extent by regulation of the trace element level and, in accordance with B\u00fcrgi's principle, in the combination effect, many favourable side effects are produced. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness. Molybd\u00e4n compositum can be administered as trace element preparation both in the short term in daily doses and in general, in rarer doses: 1 tablet about every 2nd or 3rd day. One starts with 1 tablet daily (for 3 to 4 days; when well tolerated and there are no unfavourable side effects, also for a longer period, of about 8 to 10 days). Then 1 tablet is administered, only 2 to 3 times weekly and later, possibly only once weekly. Trace elements, however, should not be given in overdoses, as they can then have a toxic effect. According to our experience, a dosage of 0.015 mg sodium molybdate per tablet is sufficient for substitution, and in combination with the above constituents, should be restricted to rare doses. If any undesirable or unexplained symptoms appear, it is beneficial to suspend medication for 3 to 5 days, followed by a reduction in dosage. With the usual dosage, no undesirable side effects are known. However, interactions with other preparations, including biotherapeutic agents, cannot always be excluded, when a mutual intensification occurs according to B\u00fcrgi's principle, with possibly excessive reactions. A suspension of medication for several days clarifies the biological situation. In many cases, 1 tablet weekly is sufficient as maintenance dose. In serious dyscrasia, however, at least temporarily for 1 to 3 weeks, daily doses may be beneficial (and possibly necessary). As the organism suffering from cancer is deficient in molybdenum, in certain cases, provided that it is well tolerated, 1 tablet daily can even be administerd through many weeks.

Conjunctivitis (chronic and acute) - alongside dry eye - is the most frequent eye disease of all. Because of the increasing sensitivity of people (allergy) as well as increasing environmental poisons (ozone, air pollutants) and work-related stress (working with PCs, air-conditioned rooms), inflammatory eye diseases now occur with ever more frequency (increase in incidence: 10 - 15 per cent annually). The symptoms of conjunctivitis are itching and burning of the eyes, a gritty feeling in the eyes and increased lachrymal secretion. Contact lenses may be another cause. So-called dry eyes is the eye disease treated most frequently with medications, the annual increase being 10 - 15 per cent. Elderly people are affected in particular. It is precisely in old age that the formation of lachrymal fluid decreases. Symptoms range from simple discomfort, such as itching and burning, to a sensation of foreign bodies. The homoeopathic combination preparation Oculoheel contains various homoeopathically prepared active ingredients. On the basis of their antiphlogistic, anti-oedematous and antiseptic properties, they have proved suitable for treatment of conjunctivitis and so- called dry eyes. As a result of their good tolerability, Oculoheel eye drops are also suitable for long-term treatment, e.g. of chronic conjunctivitis. Since Oculoheel contains no preservatives, wearers of contact lenses can also use the preparation without problems. Oculoheel contains the medicinal agent Jaborandi (pilocarpus j.). The main active ingredient of Jaborandi (pilocarpus j.) is pilocarpine. Pilocarpine is used in ophthalmology as a miotic and to reduce intraocular pressure. It has therefore proved particularly appropriate to use Jaborandi (pilocarpus j.) for overstrained eyes, heat and burning in the eyes, and accommodation difficulties. Euphrasia is indicated for inflammatory eye conditions associated with excessive secretion or lachrymal flow. This plant, called eyebright, was already used as an antiphlogistic in folk medicine. The range of indications for Euphrasia is given by the following principal symptoms: stinging and burning of the eyes, inflamed reddening of the conjunctiva, inflammation of the cornea, swelling and sticking together of the lids, copious lachrymal flow, especially in the wind. The main active ingredients of Cochlearia are mustard oils. Cochlearia has an anti-oedematous and antiseptic action. The main fields of use of Cochlearia are chronic eye inflammations. Echinacea angustifolia is not only known as an antiseptic in folk medicine, but is also used in homoeopathy on any type of septic process. In ophthalmology, Echinacea has proved suitable for eye pain (when reading) and lachrymal flow in fresh air. Oculoheel\u00ae Tablets chronic forms).

Especially indicated is Podophyllum compositum for pains in the right hypogastrium, which radiate into the right thigh. Alternating remedies such as Veratrum-Homaccord (colitis), Diarrheel S (gastro- enteritis), Nux straining), (dysenteriform etc. are well adapted to Podophyllum compositum. Since spondylolisthesis can cause or stimulate comparable disorders, in painful conditions also the intervertebral origin should always be taken into consideration. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the symptoms and the stage of the illness: for preliminary and after-treatment of neoplasia (pre- or post-operative), as well as before- and after radiation therapy, 10 drops 3 times hourly and then only 3 times daily; in acute disorders, massive initial-dose therapy: 10 drops every 15 minutes.

Pharmacological and clinical notes Populus tremuloides (aspen) nephritis, cystitis, nephrolithiasis. Cantharis (Spanish constituents of Populus compositum SR , therapeutic possibilities result for the treatment of disorders of the renal function and excretion, albuminuria and irritative disorders of the urinary system, as well as cystopyelitis, cystitis, hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis and, in particular, also urinary disorders (1st stage of prostatic adenoma). When all acute reaction phases, especially infections such as angina, influenza, etc. are correctly treated biologically, i.e. in the form of accelerated release and elimination of homotoxins, damage to the renal system is not to be expected. Should such damage occur, however, biological possibilities of the most varied types are available, such as injections of Solidago compositum S and Echinacea compositum S, possibly also of Traumeel S, Engystol N and the most varied single remedy Injeels (e.g. after retoxic treatment of angina, etc.), on the other hand, however, also in delayed damage, in order, once a cellular phase has been reached (in the form of nephrosclerosis, chronic nephrosis or albuminuria), to achieve the regeneration which may still be possible, also with Populus compositum SR (8-10 or 15-20 drops 3-6 times daily and at first possibly more frequently). For accompanying nephrolithiasis (with colic), Atropinum compositum is indicated . Further, the additional prescription of suitable antihomotoxic and biotherapeutic agents is recommended, such as Albumoheel S (albuminuria), Reneel and Spascupreel (the latter for nephrolithiasis), Galium-Heel in all cases of renal diseases, in order to promote regressive vicariation, whether merely in the form of elimination of deposition phases such as renal calculi, or on the other hand, to promote the restoration of cellular phases (nephrosis, nephrosclerosis) in excretion phases (urine excretion). In this connection the support of a co-ordinated detoxication and elimination system is biologically important, for which preparations such as compositum. As auxiliary Testis compositum (revitalizing effect for men) or Ovarium compositum (for women) are indicated; to stimulate the general defensive system also Thyreoidea compositum possibly Tonsilla compositum. For pyuria and hydronephrosis, Cantharis compositum S is specially indicated, most effective when administered, in the first place, i.v., and in addition, Cystopyelonephritis-Nosode-Injeel, and orally Albumoheel S or Mercurius-Heel S . Especially with regard to the renal function and the treatment of disturbances of renal detoxication and excretion, the entire homotoxin detoxication system of the organism must always be taken into consideration, e.g. by means of the alternating application of various Composita preparations and biotherapeutic and antihomotoxic remedies. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: In acute disorders and at the start of the treatment, massive initial-dose therapy 10-20 drops (1/2-)hourly, then only 10 drops twice to 4 times daily, with, or alternating with auxiliary remedies. For albuminuria, 10 drops at first 6 times daily, later 3-4 times daily, possibly in addition to Reneel and Albumoheel S. Procainum compositum Injection ml. Indications: Support of the defensive system, particularly of the sympathetic nerve and the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland/adrenal cortex system. For revitalisation with all types of developments in cellular phases; the pre-cancerous state. Contraindications: Known allergy to procaine, benzoic acid and sulphonamide. Cross-hypersensitivity to substances with chemical structures similar to procaine (e.g. local ester anaesthetics and parabens) cannot be excluded. Concurrent treatment with sulphonamides or cholinesterase inhibitors. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency. Myasthenia gravis. During pregnancy Procainum compositum should only be used for carefully selected indications. Side effects: Parenteral administration: Partly dependent on dose and speed of injection, central nervous disturbances, excitability, breathing difficulties, bronchospasm, muscle tremor up to generalised cramps, nausea, vomiting, urticaria, mucosal oedema, exanthem, drop of blood pressure, tachycardia or bradycardia, anaphylactic shock and renal failure. Some cases have been fatal. Postmenopausal genital bleeding has been observed. Local reactions at the site of intramuscular or subcutaneous injection are uncommon, but occasionally swelling, oedema, erythema, papulovesicular eczema, and superficial or deep necrosis and haematoma formation have been seen at the site of injections. Local allergies and pseudoallergic reactions to procaine in the form of contact dermatitis accompanied by erythema, pruritus extending to formation of blisters may occur. In case of cutaneous manifestation of procaine allergy, allergic reactions may also occur after administration of sulphonamides or oral hypoglycaemic agents. Procainum compositum injections in the head/neck area are associated with an increased risk of symptoms of central nervous system toxicity. In patients with impaired hepatic function, the half-life and hence duration of action of procaine are prolonged. In patients with seizure disorders particular vigilance should be maintained for any manifestations of central nervous symptoms. Interactions with other agents: The antibacterial efficacy of concurrent sulphonamide therapy is reduced by the procaine metabolite p-aminobenzoic acid. Concurrent therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to accumulation of procaine due to interference with procaine catabolism. Simultaneous administration of non-depolarising muscle relaxants will prolong the duration of action of procaine. Dosage: In general, 3-1 times weekly 1 ampoule i.m., s.c., i.d.

Procainum hydrochloricum (procaine hydrochloride) Geriatric remedy, arteriosclerosis, peripheral circulatory disorders, neuralgia. Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Procainum compositum, therapeutical possibilities result for the revitalization of cellular phases and the support of the defensive system. Since the defensive system, especially in cellular phases and in neoplasia, becomes increasingly strained and finally exhausted, Procainum compositum is indicated not only as a geriatric remedy but also for revitalisation in cellular phases of all kinds, particular for precancerous state, but also for neoplasia which has already appeared. Procainum compositum is especially indicated, including in general toxin levels and for high homotoxin levels, e.g. reaction phasese such as influenza (with ampoules) well as for neuralgia and in areas of neural disturbance. In neoplasia, the application of Glyoxal compositum is beneficial (usually injected very rarely or once only) in order to release the decomposition and depolymerisation processes through the immune defences (W.F. Koch), possibly with the addition of cAMP D 30 and Pulsatilla compositum; Thalamus compositum once weekly (influence of the faulty neural control) as mixed injection with Procainum compositum.

Pharmacological and clinical notes Pulsatilla Sulfur (sulphur) Reagent in diseases, e.g. for irritating, weeping cutaneous eruptions, malodorous sudoresis of the armpits, pruritus, activity is Cortisonum gland, pituitary gland and connective on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Pulsatilla compositum, therapeutic possibilities result for the stimulation of the defensive system, especially the connective tissue function; in particular also, to increase the action, biological injection preparations (mixed injections), e.g. of Nosodes, for the treatment of cancer as well as for the therapy of cellular phases in general, also to be used experimentally in the treatment of virus diseases (in addition to, or alternating with Engystol N and Thyreoidea compositum ); also in therapeutical impairment for the reactivation of damaged defensive systems (bone marrow, interior lobe of the pituitary glandcortex of the suprarenal gland mechanism, liver damage, etc.), also postoperatively after the application of antibiotics, phenylbutazone, etc. Further, Pulsatilla compositum should be administered in order to achieve regressive vicariation, i.e. in the conversion of degenerative phases in inflammatory diseases (reaction phases), when it is attempted to convert the phase in toto and not merely to achieve ulceration of the carcinoma tissue. All feverish conditions arising in the course of the biological treatment of degeneration phases and neoplasia, including the artificially induced attacks of fever in the form of biological fever therapy must, therefore, on no account be treated with any anti-inflammatory or antipyretic measures, as this would render impossible the attempt by the vegetative organisation, through immune reactions and subsequent connective tissue reactions with inflammation and fever, to bring about the degradation and decomposition of defective cell groups or cellularly fixed degeneration phases. Surgical intervention, such as the removal of the tumour in toto, lancing of the abscess, etc., should take place in good time. Radium, Roentgen and cobalt irradiation, etc. should be carried out for the purpose of finally deactivating identifiable, localized neoplasia, also after radical removal, in consultation with the radiologists, according to the position in each individual case. Fresh cell therapy with the most damaged organs of the defensive system (thymus, liver, spleen, bone marrow as well as thalamus opticus and corpus pineale = epiphysis) should also be tried in cases which have been treated and in final conditions, in addition to other biotherapeutical agents (especially Pulsatilla compositum, Viscum album-Injeel , cAMP D12, etc.). Further, mixed injections are indicated, in each case according to indications, e.g. Circulo-Injeel (disturbances of the peripheral circulation), Lymphomyosot damage, mesenchymal blockage), etc. Pulsatilla compositum is also capable of correcting excessive reactions, e.g. those arising from a possible overdose of Molybd\u00e4n compositum. A particularly favourable combination injection is formed by the addition of cAMP D8 or D12 or D30 to Pulsatilla compositum. Pulsatilla compositum is, without question, a preparation having great scope of action and diverse applications, which the biological doctor, from the aspect of activating the defensive function, especially of the connective tissue, can utilize in various ways, not only in the therapy of viral diseases and neoplasia but generally in cellular phases. Although certain general reactions, including an increase of fever, are quite possible after Pulsatilla compositum (s.c., i.d., i.m., i.v., possibly as mixed injection with others), in its administration so far no situation has arisen showing that the patient has suffered any harm. As inflammation is a biologically advantageous defensive process against toxins, for this reason, in any defensive reactions which are increased by Pulsatilla compositum, there should be no suppression of these defensive measures with antibiotics or chemotherapeutics. In such cases, in addition to possible surgical intervention, biotherapeutics are appropriate such as Traumeel homoeopathic single remedies or combination preparations in injection form (or also orally, e.g. Arnica- Heel); for extremely high temperatures (hyperthermia) Aconitum-Injeel forte S i.v., possibly as mixed injection with Sulfur-Injeel S and Pyrogenium-Injeel. Antibiotics and anti-inflammatories (phenylbutazone, etc.) should be avoided as far as possible, including post-operatively, as also all other drugs which could damage the main defensive system, including the blood picture, bone marrow, liver, etc. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: at the start of treatment 1 ampoule daily, later once to 3 times weekly, i.m., s.c., i.v., possibly in mixed injections 10 drops 3 times daily; in acute disorders initially 10 drops every 15 minutes, over a period lasting up to two hours.

Strophanthus compositum is specifically focused on the symptomatology of the heart and coronary diseases, when not only the heart is taken into consideration but also important accompanying circumstances such as cold sweat (Veratrum), sickness (Aethusa cynapium, Tabacum), conditions of Glonoinum); likewise, however, the clinically and experimentally detectable expansion of the coronary circulation, brought about by Glonoinum and the stopping of the tendency towards haemorrhages in the tissues (Tormentilla) are taken into consideration and the over-acidification of the tissue by Acidum sarcolacticum which usually precedes infarction, is reduced. In addition to Cactus compositum (i.v. and orally), alternating with Strophanthus compositum (in i.m., s.c. or i.d.), the oral preparations Cralonin, Veratrum-Homaccord and possibly Vomitus-Heel as well as Cardiacum-Heel should find application, as these preparations should also be taken each once daily over a fairly long period by patients at risk from infarction, in addition to weekly or twice-weekly injections of Cactus compositum, Cor compositum and Strophanthus compositum. Good coupling possibilities also result from Carbo compositum (when there is danger of apoplexy). In increased blood pressure, although not in the acute condition, an intermediate injection of Rauwolfia compositum should be considered. Regarding the precise additional prescription appropriate to the syndrome or symptoms of the patient, the decision is made in every case in accordance with the overall picture ( Cardiacum-Heel , Cralonin, Glonoin-Homaccord, etc.). For the after-treatment of myocardial infarction, therefore, the choice must be made to among Angio-Injeel, Cactus compositum, Carbo compositum and Strophanthus compositum. In this case also the type of injection is of importance, whether it should be i.v., s.c. or i.m. Angio-Injeel has the mildest Cactus compositum and Strophanthus compositum, injected i.v., can bring rapid and sustained help. Alternatively, injections can be given, especially for collapse and where there is a risk of apoplexy, of Carbo compositum i.v., and Strophanthus compositum administered some time later s.c. or i.m. or i.d. (in the front upper part of the thorax as a wheal, which has also proved to be beneficial with Angio-Injeel), in addition, orally, Cralonin and Cactus compositum S in frequent alternating doses (5-8 drops). Also Cardiacum-Heel has a pain-relieving action, doubtless since, by means of Cardiacum-Heel the circulatory conditions in the coronary region are improved. For disorders in the arm, Kalmia compositum is indicated. Aurumheel N drops counteract the often pronounced myocardial weakness, preferably administered continuously in alternation with Cralonin. The dosage is adjusted in accordance with the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: 1 ampoule 3 times weekly to daily i.m., s.c., i.d., i.v. the conditions where iodine is indicated.

A strict distinction should be made in this connection between the comparatively innocuous senile diabetes, which can be regulated, to a great extent, dietetically, and the prognostically usually considerably more unfavourable malignant juvenile diabetes which, in principle, is based on serious enzyme or system damage of retoxic causation (hypophyseal-adrenal system, pancreatic and hepatic enzymes and probably also the thyroid gland). The first form, which represents the overwhelming majority of cases, can be effectively influenced by biotherapeutic means, namely with: 1. Regulation of the diet, i.e. strict prohibition of the ingestion of pork (including sausages of all kinds, bacon, ham, lard, etc.), possibly a daily ration of oat flakes (only 1-2 dessertspoonsful or a small plate of porridge or gruel in the morning); as meat mainly beef, mutton, poultry; fish and egg dishes and, first and foremost, vegetables (varieties of cabbage, salads, etc.), taking into consideration the usual calorie charts. Never overeat, when feeling satiated, stop immediately! 2. Stimulation of the organ and enzyme functions with specifically oriented homoeopathic remedies, enzyme factors and organ extracts (in not too high a dosage, as the medium to higher potencies show a considerably better action with constitutionally far-reaching subsequent effects). The therapeutical efforts can be considerably aided by intermediate injections of Hepar compositum , further , Momordica compositum, Ceanothus-Homaccord , etc. (the latter possibly by oral medication). As must be assumed on the basis of cases shown by the anamnesis to be previously affected, the malignant juvenile diabetes is founded on earlier serious (re)toxic damage (including from chemotherapeutic agents, often through sulphonamides which have been used in the treatment of angina tonsillaris and acute reaction phases of other kinds). In these cases, serious disturbances of the regulatory system are present, not only of the adrenal system and pancreas but also of the central hormonal or neurohormonal control (Claude Bernard's diabetic puncture, from which it emerges that also influencing the microbial flora can lead to diabetes). Therefore, in general, one will not be able to manage without continuous insulin injections. In these cases, also the regular consumption of gruel is to be implicitly recommended, as oats obviously contain an antidiabetogenic (antiketogenic) principle. In juvenile diabetes, every attempt should be made, by the administration of Syzygium compositum (orally), possibly in addition Galium-Heel and Psorinoheel the , Engystol N , Hepeel and possibly Lymphomyosot as well as suitable suis-organ preparations), to achieve, through regressive vicariation, i.e. intercurrently occurring infectious diseases or reaction phases such as angina tonsillaris, influenzal infections, etc., a biologically correct restoration of the degeneration phase which, otherwise, would proceed deleteriously. In diabetics, practically every reaction phase of the acute or chronic type (e.g. fistular suppurations, the development of eczema and other skin diseases, etc., as well as influenza, angina, etc.) represents an alternative phase through which the intermediary homotoxins are eliminated. Therefore, such reaction (alternative) phases should not be suppressed, since otherwise an acute transmission to the catastrophic degeneration phase (coma diabeticum) would be imminent. Necessitous times have demonstrated reliably that senile diabetes, frequently, and possibly entirely, determined genetically, in the end merely represents a biologically advantageous defensive mechanism of the organism, of homotoxic causation, in order to eliminate the surplus supply of nutrient constituents (particularly in the form of pork) in the simplest way, i.e. through the intermediary product glucose, which in the organism (generally as energy carrier) is easily transportable and always accessible. When diabetes mellitus is considered from this point of view, the improvement achieved through suitable dietetic measures becomes self-explanatory, when in no way should the restriction of carbohydrates (particularly in the form of vegetables) be placed first and foremost, but above all, the omission of foodstuffs considered to be of high calorie content, and of substances containing toxins which might encourage the tendency to acidification associated with diabetes (particularly meat substances in any form). At the same time, in the benign forms of diabetes there is usually also a tendency to arteriosclerosis, which can also be treated with Syzygium compositum, when preparations such as Cralonin, Melilotus-Homaccord, Aurumheel N drops and injection preparations such as Rauwolfia compositum (hypertonic) can be interposed. If diabetic patients undergo disturbances of the peripheral circulation, possibly even with gangrene formation, injections of Placenta compositum, Circulo-Injeel and as single remedy Natrium pyruvicum-Injeel are indicated. Diabetes must, like all defensive reactions to toxins in general, be called an \"illness\" and be considered in the total biological picture of the organisms and not, perhaps, as a localized disturbance of the pancreas. This leads to the therapeutical action on the most varied factors, particularly in the form of a correct adjustment of nutrition (pork in any form is strictly forbidden) as well as on the appropriate auxiliary factors (hepatic function, activation of the connective tissue), when Syzygium compositum represents an important preparation for long-term medication. The most effective injection for diabetes mellitus has proved to be Coenzyme compositum ampoules; for diabetic gangrene, in addition to Circulo-Injeel, in particular Natrium pyruvicum-Injeel (1 ampoule s.c. 3 times weekly). The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: 10 drops twice to 4 times daily; at the start of treatment for about 5 days, 6 times daily. Tanacet-Heel\u00ae Drops Composition: 100 g alcohol. Indications: Nervous irritative conditions of idiopathic nature, particularly during the removal of worms; alternation between loss of appetite and ravenous hunger. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to tansy and other botanicals of the Compositae family. Side effects: None known. Interactions with other medication: None known. Dosage: In general, 10 drops 3 times daily. Package sizes: Drop bottles containing 30 and 100 ml.

Artemesia vulgaris (common artemesia) Disturbances Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Tanacet-Heel, therapeutic possibilities result for the expulsion of worms, with secondary, toxic symptoms, tics, also chorea minor during worm removal (also idiopathic), cramp, loss of appetite and Iycorexia alternating (Tanacet-Heel stimulates the appetite). The helminths are not killed by Tanacet-Heel, but the homotoxic terrain which is palatable to the worms (excretion of homotoxins in the intestine) is changed. Tanacet-Heel should always be administered with alternating remedies, e.g. with Nervoheel for tearfulness, exhaustion, discomfort; Vomitusheel for nausea and sickness; disorders of the hepatic functions and anorexia; Spascupreel for intestinal spasms (helminthic coil), intestinal colic, Nux ileus arising from coil - for cleansing the terrain; Diarrheel S for dyspeptic phenomena and toxin adsorption. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the symptoms and the stage of the illness: 10 drops 3-4 times daily. For long-term therapy after the introductory dosage: 10 drops twice daily, possibly on sugar. Tartephedreel\u00ae alcohol. Indications: Bronchitis, particularly of asthmatic nature, bronchial asthma, cough (which hardly eases). Prolonged cough of scrofulous children, bronchial catarrh, laryngeal catarrh of different type, certain forms of whooping cough. All types of catarrhal affections of the respiratory tract.

Catarrh (flow of mucus) aids detoxication. The same applies for the influenza virus which, through the inflammatory process, is broken down and eliminated. Catarrh, therefore, should not be suppressed but its course promoted and accelerated, in order to purify the toxic condition, e.g. in bronchial asthma. The individual constituents of Tartephedreel give rise to the anti-inflammatory, excretory and detoxicating action of the preparation. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: for continuous treatment 10 drops 3(-4) times daily. In acute disorders, massive initial-dose therapy with alternating remedies, 10 drops every 15 minutes until an improvement is observed. The following prescription has proved effective in bronchial asthma: Husteel 5-8 drops at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. Tartephedreel 5-8 drops at 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Drosera-Homaccord 5-8 drops at 12 noon and 8 p.m. or all 3 preparations taken together 2-4-6 times daily.

Zincum metallicum (zinc) Conditions of irritation of the central and peripheral nervous system, e.g. nervous urinary disorders. Acidum ascorbicum (Vitamin C) Co-factor for enzyme functions (redox systems). Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Testis compositum, therapeutic possibilities result for the stimulation of the organ functions in dystrophia adiposogenitalis penis plastica, osteomalacia (men), diabetes mellitus and for various other metabolic disturbances, also as auxiliary remedy in hepatic damage as well as geriatric remedy. Promotes regressive vicariation. The range of action of Testis compositum extends to the male sex glands and, in combination with the stimulating action on various organ and glandular functions, and in joint action with homoeopathic single remedies, brings about an improvement in the sexual functions, activating the connective tissue (e.g. by means of cortisone in the reversal effect), as well as exerting a stimulating effect on the overall physical and mental function and with revitalizing factors (in impotentia coeundi and disturbances of the sexual capacity), with trace element action and catalytic effects (Vitamin C), resulting in a broad combination effect in the treatment of the widest variety of organic diseases and functional disorders. In this connection, the additional administration (alternating injections) of suitable Composita, e.g. in degenerative diseases and Glyoxal compositum, on the other hand also, for the improvement of the organ functions, Hepar compositum (stimulation of the detoxicating hepatic function), Cor Placenta compositum (circulatory and cardiac functions), Solidago compositum S (renal function) and especially Cerebrum compositum (stimulation of the cerebral and neural functions) leads to the lowering of the homotoxin level and, therefore, of the causal factors of the illness. Testis compositum, therefore, should be administered not only for the abatement of masculine tonicity and the disorders arising from this such as prostatic adenoma, hypertonia, peripheral circulatory disturbances and disorders of the hepatic function, but also as intermediate remedy for affections in the sphere of degenerative phases, possibly with Thyreoidea compositum in pronounced neoplasm phases, in which cases this therapy should be started at the earliest possible moment. The repeated alternation of various Composita (injection preparations) with various indications appropriate to the glandular and organ functions in question, especially the preparation Testis compositum ampoules, opens up the widest variety of therapeutical possibilities (in addition to oral therapeutic agents such osteochondrosis disorders, neuralgia, etc. in addition to Discus compositum, biotherapeutic-antihomotoxic agents such as Traumeel S, Zeel, etc. are indicated in the widest variety of forms of application, and for hypertonia, in general, Rauwolfia compositum. If the stimulating action alone should not be sufficient, for the purpose of far-reaching stimulation of the detoxicating system, not only of the lymphatic apparatus but also of the suprarenal glands, and especially of the connective tissue function, also intermediate injections of Tonsilla compositum are indicated. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: at the start of treatment 1 ampoule i.m., s.c., i.d., possibly i.v. 3 times weekly; after improvement only 1 ampoule once to twice weekly, alternating with suitable auxiliary remedies. With this preparation, which contains vitamins, after s.c. injections a fleeting burning pain may occur. Thalamus compositum Injection solution Indications: Stimulation of the central regulatory functions in degenerative diseases and neoplasia. Dosage: In general, 1-3 times weekly 1 ampoule i.m., s.c., i.d., or if necessary i.v. Package sizes: Packs containing 5, 10, 50 and 100 ampoules of 2.2 ml. Pharmacological and clinical notes Thalamus opticus suis (optic thalamus) Stimulation factor of the central control functions. Corpus pineale suis (epiphysis) In neoplasm phases, antagonistic functions antitumorous activity. Glandula suprarenalis suis on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Thalamus compositum, therapeutic possibilities result for auxiliary treatment for the stimulation of the central control functions in neoplasia and degeneration phases. In neoplasia, with increasing gravity of the disease, atrophy of the suprarenal glands is found, as well as necrotic foci in the thalamus opticus, particularly in the region of the nucleus pallidus and corpus striatum (\"Pallido-Striatum\"), which lead to the assumption of defective central control. Now specific stimulative therapy can be applied effectively, similarly live-cell or frozen-cell therapy (Niehans, Winkler, Reckeweg, etc.), especially with thymus dilutions. Between the lenticular nucleus and the caudate part of the nucleus caudatus (caudate nucleus) the pars pallida and corpus striatum are situated in which, i.e. in the centre of the thalamic control, numerous basically vital functions (of the cybernetically controlled vegetative organization) of man, also display alteration in cancer. From these, possibly neural disturbances, provoked at a distance, of a regulatory nature or of signalling action, emanate (which, among other things, are responsible for what are known as pigmental spots in the iris, which can be observed after retoxication processes [retoxic impregnation]). While the hypophysis cerebri stimulates the growth processes (through the somatropic hormone) and is therefore contraindicated in neoplasia live-cell therapy, the corpus pineale possesses certain antagonistic functions such as growth inhibition, anti-tumour activity and an influence on asthma and phases to the right of the biological section. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: 1 ampoule i.m., s.c., i.d., possibly i.v., once to 3 times weekly, possibly in alternation with Pallido-Striatum D12 . Pallido-Striatum: nucleus pallidus and corpus striatum (in thalamus opticus) appear, when diseased to be the loci of the central pathological defective control of the incidence of cancer. Thyreoidea compositum Injection solution dysfunction; stimulation of the glandular functions, as well as of the defensive system and the functions of the connective tissues, particularly in preparation includes several iodine-containing ingredients. In cases of thyroid disorder with reduced iodine tolerance use only on the advice of a physician. Side effects: Aggravation of existing hyperthyroidism. Intravenous administration may cause hypersensitivity reactions and sudden drop of blood pressure. Interactions with other medication: None known. Dosage: In general, 1-3 times weekly 1 ampoule i.m., s.c., i.d., or if necessary i.v. Package sizes: Packs containing 5, 10, 50 and 100 ampoules of 2.2 ml.

Tumour formation is to be regarded as the end phase of all homotoxicoses, when the organism, as a result of the serious enzyme disturbances and mutagenic damage of the DNA in the affected tissues, can find no other solution but to condense the homotoxins in the neoplasm (in the \"ash tray\" principle). Possibly, especially in a further attack by intermediary and exogenic homotoxins (including sutoxins), the organism can attempt to decompose the neoplasm by means of ulceration. A feasible method of curing cancer lies in the conversion of neoplasm phases in toto into reaction phases. As the tests over many years with tissue extracts, catalysts, homoeopathic remedies of stimulative action and hormones applied in the reversal effect have shown, a lowering of the homotoxin level can be achieved for the organism by other means, i.e. not by destructive but through constructive, enzyme-regenerating therapy, so that the genetically established possibilities for the synthesis of reparative enzymes, especially in biological therapy (particularly with the Composita preparations) can produce their full effect, in this way really preparing and extending the possibilities of a biological cancer cure. In this connection, especially Thyreoidea compositum is a very important preparation which, compositum to astonishing results (in addition to Galium-Heel , Psorinoheel N, Lymphomyosot , Traumeel S, etc.). In the treatment of neoplasm phases, the neoplasm should not be placed so much in the foreground as the causal toxin level and the damage to the defensive system caused by homotoxins, including, in particular, to the cellular respiration and genetic material which, by means of stimulative catalysts, intermediary products and tissue preparations, as included in the various Composita preparations, may still be influenced therapeutically. In the treatment, furthermore, not only the objective research findings and the most extensive laboratory findings are to be taken into consideration, but also the subjective symptoms of the patient are significant. As a result, often a conversion to regressive vicariation can be seen which, in the treatment of the cellular phases, is of such decisive significance. Thyreoidea compositum , in addition to Galium-Heel (administered orally as well as and further in addition to Engystol N , Traumeel S , and in compositum , Ubichinon compositum and Glyoxal compositum, because of its stimulative effect and intensity of action directed to the induction of blocked enzymes, is one of the most important preparations in the treatment of dedifferentiation phases.

Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Tonsilla compositum, therapeutic possibilities result for increasing the bodily defences exudative diathesis and also therapeutical damage of various kinds such as granulopenia, agranulocytosis and leukaemia (in this case daily at first), further, for induratio penis plastica, sclerodermia, chronic gout and primary chronic polyarthritis as auxiliary remedy, as well as in the early stage of neoplasm phases, due to its effect in activating the connective tissue. Tonsilla compositum shows clearly a combined action on various systems of organs participating in the defence against homotoxins and the damage caused by them, when not only organ and tissue extracts but also nosodes, hormones, intermediary factors and homoeotherapeutic agents directed specifically towards regressive vicariation and against enzyme damage, bring about an overall action aimed at a powerful rise in the bodily defences in the widest variety of pathological conditions; in fact, not only in exudative diathesis and dysontogenesis in lymphatic children but also in toxic effects and the widest variety of therapeutical damage. In these cases the intermediate prescription is also recommended of preparations by means of which enzyme functions are again regulated, e.g. Coenzyme compositum ampoules and Ubichinon compositum ampoules; in serious cases viral damage or danger from neoplasm also Glyoxal compositum, as auxiliary remedy also Thyreoidea compositum ; for inflammation flaring up repeatedly but which does not lead to the dissolution of the retoxic phase, also Traumeel S , Engystol N and, in particular, Echinacea compositum (forte) S. In such cases especially the alternating prescription or injection of the above- mentioned preparations is to be recommended, with the corresponding intermediate prescription of the oral therapeutic agents otherwise indicated, such as Lymphomyosot , Psorinoheel , damage, of retoxic causation) occur in profusion, this results from the appearance of cellular phases, in mild cases at first of impregnation phases; in serious cases, noticeable through symptoms of degeneration and possibly neoplasm phases. In these cases it is essential to recommend, in addition to Tonsilla compositum, possibly as early as on the following day, Coenzyme compositum , and then possibly Thyreoidea compsitum, followed (after one to two days) by Ubichinon compositum , in order, through the re- stimulation of blocked enzyme systems, first to achieve the basic conditions for detoxication of the homotoxins. The action of Tonsilla compositum should have subsided before a new injection takes place, especially after other preparations indicated, as mentioned above, have been interposed, when also Hepeel Zeel, etc. can be considered, according to the syndrome in question. In addition, very good possibilities for combination are offered with suitable, pathogenetically indicated Nosodes (Tuberculinum-Injeel, Bacillinum-Injeel . etc.). Preparations which provide powerful stimulation in general to the defensive system are, in addition to other antihomotoxic agents which all act on the main defence system, in particular the following: Engystol N (especially also in viral diseases), Echinacea compositum (forte) S (generally and in neoplasia), Pulsatilla compositum of the connective (stimulates basal (reticulo-endothelium, total defensive system), Gripp-Heel (general prophylaxis in infections). The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: at first 1 ampoule i.m., s.c. (possibly with the patient's own blood), i.d., possibly i.v. 2-3 times weekly. After the disorders have abated, for constitutional treatment, 1 ampoule once to twice weekly, possibly alternating with other suitable ( etc.). With this preparation, which contains vitamins, a fleeting, burning pain may occur upon the i.d. and s.c. injections.

Adenosinum triphosphoricum respiratory chain. Magnesium gluconicum (magnesium gluconate) Trace element action, especially in enzyme functions of the citric acid cycle. Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Ubichinon compositum , therapeutical possibilities result for the stimulation of the defensive mechanisms against toxins in order to reactivate blocked enzyme systems, in the case of defective enzyme functions and in degenerative diseases (cellular phases). While in allopathic therapy, in the cellular phases located to the right of the biological section, i.e. degenerative diseases, cancer formation and other phases corresponding, in general, to what is known as chronic marasmus, all attempts by the organism to rectify these phases (appearing as illnesses or regressive vicariation) are treated with massive suppressive measures, whereby the enzyme damage present in the phases to the right of the biological section are intensified considerably and possibly made quite irreparable, the biological physician proceeds according to a totally different therapeutical principle, i.e. by stimulating blocked enzyme systems with catalysts, and depolimerization of the neoplasm phase formation characterized by condensation or polymerization (according to Professor W.F. Koch), when various quinones and activation factors of enzyme functions, in appropriate, finely graduated blends, in addition to homoeopathic remedies of antineoplasmatic action, in suitable factors (Coenzyme A, Adenosinum triphosphoricum, Nadidum, Acidum alpha-liponicum) are important, as well as the trace elements, without which the functioning of the special enzyme systems of the citric acid cycle is not possible (Manganum, Magnesium). Also in this connection, the vitamins have an important function to fulfil, less in the form of vitamin substitution than (in comparatively low concentration) as acting as guide rail in the direction of the enzyme system to be induced. This guide rail principle is also known to have proved satisfactory with the suis-organ preparations. Here one can also speak of certain key functions, in which a suitable key is necessary for specific enzymes, in order for the preparation to achieve its total action and, above all, to gain access to the precursors in enzyme synthesis. This offers theoretical possibilities that the attack by reparatory enzymes takes place, through which much damage (in the form of therapeutical damage) of the gene apparatus (possibly even in the form of carcinogenesis basically with causal mutation) can be eliminated. Frequently in such cases merely the smallest molecular units in the form of co-repressors or inductors are lacking, in order to reveal the effects of the reparatory enzymes as regeneration. The action of Ubichinon compositum therapy is often shown as a beneficial post injection fatigue, in the same way as with Coenzyme compositum , possibly also with Thyreoidea compositum and Hepar , so that the patient is not denied repose, similar to sleep induced for therapeutical purposes, in order to allow the possibilities of far-reaching restorative processes in the enzyme functions and systems to take effect. Ubichinon compositum represents a preparation by means of which progressive vicariation in the area of cellular phases, and finally damage leading to neoplasm phases can be cancelled out, and meanwhile occasional alternating injections of suitable preparations such as Coenzyme compositum , Glyoxal due to the various points of attack, facilitate a broad final effect. Ubichinon compositum increaseses sensitization to X-rays, etc. (2 hrs. in advance i.m.) and have a favourable action in extreme homotoxin levels, including, for example, for influenza, abscesses, catarrh (aphonia etc.) and similar affections. Ubichinon compositum is administered then, possibly in combination with Echinacea compositum (forte) S, for neoplasia with Viscum compositum (medium, forte). Still to be mentioned is the fact that the preparations with a Vitamin B1 content (Coenzyme compositum , Ubichinon compositum and Discus compositum) should be injected intravenously only slowly and carefully, as many patients with therapeutical damage (phases 4 to 6) show hypersensitivity towards Vitamin B1, although at the concentrations used here, such incidents, in general, are not to be expected, since the vitamins merely act as guide rails and do not form a massive substitution therapy. The dosage is adapted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: 1 ampoule once to three times weekly i.m., s.c., i.d.. Only after any possible reactions or disorders appearing have subsided, should the injection be repeated. At intervals, as required, injections of other suitable etc.). With this preparation, which contains vitamins, a fleeting, burning pain may occur upon i.d. and s.c. injections. Valerianaheel\u00ae Drops conditions of restlessness; neurasthenia.

Valerianaheel has no toxic side effects and should be reinforced at times by the otherwise indicated Heel biotherapeutics, e.g. by Rhododendroneel S for insomnia due to rheumatic and cardiac conditions, by Nux vomica-Homaccord , Hepeel , etc. for insomnia resulting from disturbances of the hepatic functions (the onset of a pronounced acid tide in the night, between about 2 and 6 a.m. causing wakefulness followed by morning tiredness). The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the symptoms and the stage of the illness: In continuous treatment, 15-20 drops 3-4 times daily, possibly with the corresponding auxiliary remedies. In the evening, (possibly several times) 25 drops in water or on sugar, also when waking up in the night (possibly with auxiliary remedies, particularly Rhododendroneel S). Single dose for infants and small children: 3 drops; from the age of 2 years: 5 drops; from 6-12 years: 10 drops.

Rheum (rhubarb) Diarrhoea in children and infants, with acid stools; gastro-enteritis with colic in adults. Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Veratrum-Homaccord , therapeutical possibilities result for the treatment of dysentery, diarrhoea of all kinds, e.g. in gastro-enteritis, nutritional disorders, intestinal spasms and tenesmus, incontinentia sphincteris ani, dyspepsia in infants and small children (in addition to Gastricumeel , Diarrheel S and Nux vomica-Homaccord ). Galium-Heel , Psorinoheel and possibly Mercurius-Heel S). Conditions of collapse with cold sweat (in addition to Aurumheel N drops, Cardiacum-Heel , Galium-Heel ; for heart attacks also Glonoin-Homaccord, etc.). For sural spasms resulting from local circulatory disturbances or after injuries (e.g. rupture of muscles) Veratrum-Homaccord is effective in addition to Cruroheel S and possibly Hamamelis-Homaccord as well as Spascupreel . Veratrum-Homaccord has also proved effective in mental changes, e.g. when there is a tendency to tear everything up or to crush any objects, also in delirium tremens (i.v. with Nux vomica-Homaccord ). As intensified defecation is to be regarded as the release of homotoxins, Veratrum-Homaccord , in general in diarrhoea, should be used only when there has been considerable excretion. In cases of poisoning, Diarrheel S must be administered as well in every instance (adsorption of the toxins). The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the symptoms and the stage of the illness: for acute disorders, 10 drops every 15 minutes, otherwise 10 drops 3 4 times daily, possibly with suitable alternating or auxiliary remedies. In acute disorders 1 ampoule daily, otherwise 1 ampoule 1-3 times each. Indications: Dizziness of various origins (particularly arising from arteriosclerosis). Contraindications: None known.

Pharmacological and clinical notes Anamirta cocculus (Indian berries) Kinetosis, a feeling of emptiness and hollowness, great exhaustion and general weakness. Conium maculatum (spotted hemlock) Dizziness upon each change of position, tremulous weakness, speech disorders, ascending paralysis, arteriosclerosis. Ambra grisea (amber) Hyperexcitability, nervous pertussis, vertigo, lack of concentration and poor memory. Petroleum rectificatum (rock oil) Nausea and dizziness (kinetosis), tinnitus aurium. cocculus, Ambra grisea and Petroleum to a combination of medicaments, which displays a potentiated action in accordance with B\u00fcrgi's principle and which is based on a reversal effect in the sense of the Arndt-Schulz rule. Apart from oligodynamic trace elements such as sulphates, acetates, chlorides, phosphates of calcium, potassium, iron and manganese, which are identified in the conium extract, the principal pharmacological effect is to be attributed to the first synthetically produced alkaloid (Ladenburg, 1888) coniine, a propyl piperidine C8H17N. The picrotoxin contained in Anamirta cocculus is a stimulant of all efferent centres of the central nervous system. It acts on the cerebrum, the medulla oblongata and the spinal cord. It also influences the adrenalin secretion and activates the conium effect considerably. The aromatic compounds and the cholesterin-like ambrein contained in the amber, as well as the active hydrocarbons in the petroleum (nausea and dizziness when travelling) intensify the total action in a reciprocally potentiating sense. Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Vertigoheel, therapeutical possibilities result for the treatment of vertigo of various origins, Meni\u00e8re's syndrome (giddiness, nausea, tinnitus), dizziness through nervous factors or through arteriosclerotic changes with or without arterial hypertension, dizziness originating from the labyrinth, commotio cerebri acuta and post-concussion disorders. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the symptoms and the stage of the illness: for attacks of dizziness, massive initial-dose therapy, 1 tablet or 10 drops every 15 minutes. For the continuous treatment, 3 tablets or 10-20 drops 3 times daily. For attacks of dizziness and nausea, 1 ampoule, otherwise 1-3 times weekly 1 ampoule i.m., mg. Indications: Suppositories for infants and children in conditions of restlessness with or without fever. Also for the symptomatic treatment of common infections. Dosage: Unless otherwise prescribed, in acute disorders insert 1 suppository into the anus and repeat on several occasions; after alleviation, 1 suppository 2-3 times daily. For infants (from the first day of life) up to 6 months of age, a maximum of 1 suppository twice daily. Package sizes: Packs containing 12, 60 and 120 suppositories of 1.1 g. Pharmacological and clinical notes Chamomilla recutita (chamomile) Hypersensitivity, with stupor (children want to be carried around, one cheek hot and red, the other cold and pale); dry tickling coughs, disorders of dentition in small children and infants; otitis media, glandular swelling, intestinal colic, restlessness and conditions of excitation, insomnia.

Plantago major (plantain) Otitis media, toothache, enuresis nocturna. Pulsatilla pratensis (wind flower) Migratory disorders, remedy for of the mucosa; cardinal symptom: tearfulness. Calcium carbonicum Hahnemanni (inner white part of the oyster shell) Scrofulous glandular swellings, infantile facial eczema, affections of the mucosa with a tendency to ulceration; improves convalescence. Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Viburcol, therapeutical possibilities result for the treatment of conditions of unrest of all kinds with and without fever, the symptomatic treatment of common infections; conditions of excitation, particularly with tearfulness, moodiness, insomnia; before and after diagnostic and therapeutical intervention. Based on its composition, Viburcol is a preparation for the symptomatic treatment of restlessness, inflammation, fever and mental variations (tearfulness, moodiness). In feverish conditions, Viburcol brings about a Iytic defervescence, so that no hypotonic circulatory disorders occur. With Viburcol, also in infants, gastro-intestinal disturbances can be treated symptomatically. In the foreground are what are known as flatulent colics; here Viburcol has an anti-spasmodic effect (Chamomilla). By means of the rectal application (non-irritant suppository base) a powerful and usually rapid pharmacological reversal effect (Arndt-Schulz) with antihomotoxic action is ensured. The action of Viburcol is to be defined as an antihomotoxic detoxicating effect, in which, through the stimulation of the main defence system, an intensified enzyme activity in the form of detoxicating functions is released (homotoxone coupling). The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: in acute conditions, 1 suppository to be introduced on several occasions in succession, possibly every 1-2 hours. Otherwise 1 suppository 2-3 times daily. Viburcol can be administered innocuously to infants, and, in fact, from the first day of life onwards, without danger of harmful side effects or therapeutical damage. Up to the age of 6 months, maximum 1 suppository twice daily. Viburcol suppositories can also be administered in the appropriate indications, to adults. Viscum compositum medium Viscum compositum forte Injection phases as well as for pre-operative and postoperative therapy in neoplasia. Contraindications: The preparation includes an iodine-containing ingredient. In cases of thyroid disorder with reduced iodine tolerance use only on the advice of a physician. Side effects: In rare cases, increased flow of saliva may occur after taking this medication. If this happens, the therapist should be consulted. Intravenous administration may cause hypersensitivity reactions and sudden drop of blood pressure. Interactions with other medication: None known. Dosage: The dosage must be determined individually and adapted to the reactions of the patient in each case. In general, the injections are administered i.m., s.c., i.d., or if required, slowly i.v., according to the following system: 1st day Viscum compositum medium 2nd day Viscum compositum 3rd day Viscum compositum forte 4th day Viscum compositum medium 5th day Viscum compositum medium 6th day Viscum compositum forte 7th day break, followed weekly by a repetition according to the above scheme. Package sizes: Viscum compositum medium: Packs containing 5, 10, 50 and 100 ampoules of 2.2 ml. Viscum compositum forte: Packs containing 5, 10 and 50 ampoules of 2.2 ml. Pharmacological and clinical notes Viscum album (mistletoe) Precancerous state and neoplasia, sudden attacks of Viscum compositum (medium, forte), therapeutical possibilities result for the treatment of all neoplasias as well as preliminary stages (precancerous state), including, in particular, cases arising from therapy, post operationem, after radiation, etc. Viscum compositum also serves to support general biological therapeutical measures in chronic arthrosis, arthritis, osteopathy, spondylosis, Scheuermann's disease, etc. (in addition to Zeel, Traumeel S, etc.), further, for arteriosclerosis and wasting diseases well as in degeneration phases of all kinds (to be applied experimentally) to stimulate the body's own defences. Mistletoe, in addition to combating blood pressure disorders, also finds application as stimulating therapeutical agent in injection form and has been administered for centuries in antihomotoxic therapy for neoplasia, etc. By combination with the intermediary active substance cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), which exercises a key function, and antivirally active mercury, an intensified combination effect (E. B\u00fcrgi) is achieved in cases of neoplasia. cAMP leads the hormonal and other stimuli reaching the cell membrane further into the cell interior, activated by a phosphokinase, promoting the differentiation of the cell (while it is obstructed by the antagonistic cyclic guanidinomonophosphate - cAMP) and thereby detracting from the unrestrained, undifferentiated growth. The antiviral action of mercury was recognized many years ago by Wietfeld. In the causation of cancer viral factors (possibly degenerated genes) play a still unexplained role, so that by means of mercury in optimal (non-toxic) dosage, also favourable effects in neoplasia can be achieved. In particular, the active iodine component in mercurius jodatus flavus, by activating the function of the thyroid gland, stimulates the activity of the connective tissue, decomposing and eliminating the homotoxins arising in the neoplasia. The dosage of the three constituents is selected in such a way that the decisive main action of Viscum against tumour development is supported by the mercury component in the form of a controlled regulation of the DNA function against alien genes (viruses) and promoted in the form of a throttling of the unfettered undifferentiated growth of cancer cells by cAMP. Viscum compositum, due to the comparatively low dilution (especially in the forte preparation) has a sustained action by raising the defensive capacity. This can be recognized from the fact that, as a sign of the mobilization of the defensive forces against toxins, fever can occur. This \"patient's own curative fever\" must in no circumstances be attacked with any fever-suppressing measures. Even biological remedies for inflammation should not be used immediately in such cases, but the body's own curative fever reaction must, at least at first, be allowed free play (in the same way as after Echinacea compositum forte S) . The number of usual, as well as forte, injections is adjusted according to the reactions occurring to the injections. If fever or increased exhaustion results, further daily injections should not be given immediately, but one or two days should be allowed to pass until the reaction has subsided. In order to provide powerful stimulation to the defensive system, alternating injections with Echinacea compositum forte S are to be recommended, as by means of the concentrated Echinacea extract administered i.v., Ioosening, conversion and elimination of the causal homotoxins and the homotoxically damaged, degenerated tissue (neoplasia) can possibly be set in motion. Especially the pendular administration of Viscum compositum (medium and forte) and Echinacea compositum forte S can lead to very good therapeutical results, including in cases of plexus irritation with painful conditions. Initially, for 3 to 4 days, Echinacea compositum forte S is administered alone daily i.v. and then alternated daily with Viscum compositum (medium or forte) or in reverse order. For gynecological neoplasia with plexus irritation, Apis-Injeel S (i.v.) and Metro-Adnex-Injeel (s.c.) are suitable as intermediate remedies. The treatment, in general, is carried out in the following way: i.m., s.c., i.d., possibly slowly i.v. 1st day Viscum 2nd day Viscum compositum 3rd day Viscum compositum forte 4th day Viscum compositum medium 5th day Viscum compositum medium 6th day Viscum compositum forte 7th day break, followed weekly by a repetition according to the above scheme. Even with persistent fever, provided the patient's condition is satisfactory, no chemotherapeutics or antiobiotics, etc., should be given, but then biological therapeutic agents providing cardiac support, and possibly those influencing the inflammatory processes in the form of a natural cure should be administered, e.g. Cralonin, Aurumheel N drops, Traumeel S and further, also Engystol N , Echinacea compositum S (including forte) etc. In the case of excessive reactions after Viscum compositum forte, one again reverts to the initial application of the medium preparation. The interposition and continuance of the therapy with the Viscum compositum forte ampoules depends on the general condition and the compatibility. Naturally, the plan can be varied in such a way that on Mondays Viscum compositum medium, Wednesdays Viscum compositum medium and Fridays Viscum compositum forte are administered subcutaneously, then on the other days, Echinacea compositum forte S. The cozy relaxation and tiredness observed (particularly after the usual dosage, not forte) should be balanced by a complete recuperation (possibly resting in bed), possibly also with an intermission of 3 to 5 days from all injections (awaiting the effect).

For the maintenance of normal articular functions, undisturbed co-ordination of the metabolism of the synovial membrane and synovial fluid on the one hand and of the arthrodial cartilage on the other, is indispensable. In the cartilage, according to the Embden-Meyerhof model, lactic acid or lactate is formed, which reaches the outer cellular layer of the joint capsule through the synovial fluid. There, by stimulation of the end oxidation through the citric acid cycle, the necessary energy is released. In arthrosis, there is a pathological alteration of the metabolism of the connective tissue in the joint (cartilage, synovial membrane and also synovial fluid), characterized by increased degradation of the connective tissue structures. This results, therefore, in disproportion between catabolic and anabolic-metabolic processes. The task of effective therapy is to normalize the disturbed metabolism, as well as offering components for possible incorporation. The decisive energy-liberating reaction of the metabolism is the formation of hydrogen, which is then transferred, to a great extent, to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadidum); thus, for example, the whole of the hydrogen liberated in the course of the citric acid cycle is transferred to nadidum, the starting member of the respiratory chain. Precisely the oxidoreduction, catalysed by nadidum, between lactic acid and pyruvic acid, or the reverse, is of decisive importance in the metabolism of the joints. Thioctic acid is also a hydrogen-transferring co-factor which, above all, participates decisively in the oxidative decarboxylation (conversion of pyruvic acid to \"activated acetic acid\"). In the interaction with Coenzyme A, the formation of the \"activated acetic acid\" is made possible which, for its part, represents the \"initiator\" of the citric acid cycle, while oxalacetate can be described as the fuel, or also as the engine, of the citric acid cycle. The treatment of rheumatic diseases with sulphur has long been known. It is only through the biochemical research into mucopolysaccharide sulphates, however, that it was confirmed, i.e. could be established, that the organism can incorporate or convert the sulphur into chondroitin sulphates intrinsic to the body. The organ constituents provide important components of the connective tissue (cartilage, funiculus umbilicalis), while placenta pro- motes the circulation and the embryo has an additional stimulating action. The botanical constituents from Rhus toxicodendron, Solanum dulcamara, applied for rheumatic diseases of the joints, etc., including when the disorders are worsened in wet weather. The medicaments blended into a pharmacologically active and non-toxic combination in Zeel, on the basis of many years' medical experience and the most recent biochemical research form a highly valuable remedy for chronic diseases of the joints, as can be seen from the composition and from what has been confirmed by clinical and practical tests. Based on the individual homoeopathic constituents of Zeel, therapeutic possibilities result for the treatment of arthrosis (in particular gonarthrosis), polyarthrosis, spondylarthrosis, periarthritis humeroscapularis. The dosage is adjusted according to the disease, the clinical picture and the stage of the illness: 1 tablet to be dissolved on the tongue 3-5 times daily. 1 ampoule or, for the big joints, 2 ampoules on each occasion, s.c., i.d., i.v., or periarticularly, possibly paravertebrally.

To facilitate searching for a specific product, this section provides a complete alphabetical listing of Heel's single-constituent remedies. Specifically: Classical including \"Injeels\" in \"standard\" and \"forte\" strengths, and standard single potencies. The composition and a short summary of indications are given for these popular preparations. HomOeopathically adjusted allopathic remedies These preparations (33 in total) are denoted with an . Catalysts These preparations (106 in total) are denoted with an . Nosodes These preparations (187 in total) are denoted with an . Suis-organ preparations (also known as sarcodes) These preparations (168 in total) are denoted with an . Composition of single-constituent remedies With the exception of the single potencies, the single remedies contain balanced potency chords: A balanced potency chord consists of several potencies of one and the same constituent. The individual potencies retain their independent action even when blended together (G. Harisch, J. Dittmann: Biological Therapy, Vol. XV No 2, p. 40-46, 1997). A standard potency chord generally contains a low (i.e., D12) a middle (i.e., D30) and a high (i.e., D200) potency. A forte potency chord generally contains the potencies of the standard chord plus one lower potency (i.e., D4, D12, D30, and D200). Unless stated otherwise, the different potencies are contained in equal quantities, which add up to 1.1 ml. An example: Acidum aceticum-lnjeel Acidum D200, in equal parts. Particulars of the composition and indications are only given for the classical homoeopathic single remedies but not for the homoeopathically adjusted allopathic remedies, catalysts, nosodes, and suis-organ preparations. Type of administration and dosage of single remedies The single remedies can be injected i.m., s.c., i.d., i.v. or taken orally - one or more ampoules are poured into a small glass of water or tea (i.e., for infants and small children in fennel tea). In general, the following dosages are recommended. Classical homoepathic single-constituent remedies: 1 ampoule 3-1 times weekly. Nosodes: a. When the nosode preparation is used on the basis of its symptomatic similarity, one injection is to be given twice weekly intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intracutaneously. b. When the nosode preparation is used according to the rules of aetiological similarity with the disease history, one injection is to be given once weekly intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intracutaneously. c. When the nosode preparation is used on the basis of the aetiology of current symptoms, it may be necessary to administer the nosode preparation initially once daily or every other day (i.e. 3 times weekly), in which case it should be given in combination with whatever additional therapeutic agents are indicated in the present case. d. When the nosode preparation is used at the end of an illness or after recovery - i.e. on the basis of _aetiological similarity with the recent history\", it is recommended that one injection is given twice weekly for approximately 2 - 4 weeks. Suis-organ preparations: Initially, 1 ampoule 2 times weekly, afterwards 1 ampoule 1 time weekly intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intradermally or intravenous. It should be emphasized that these dosages are merely guidelines. The severity of the illness, the constitutional condition, and the individual reaction of the patient should be taken into account for individualized determination of dosage and/or frequency of administration. For detailed information about dosage of catalysts, nosodes, and suis-organ preparations please see selection 3 in the introduction (see page 21).

Galega officinalis-Injeel D10, D30, D200 each. g-Gamma-globulin is the carrier of the antibody function. The practical application of gamma-globulin consists of the prophylactic and therapeutic control (passive immunization) of infectious diseases, including, in particular, viral diseases, the causal agents of which still cannot normally be isolated, e.g. herpes zoster, varicella, measles, mumps, infectious mononucleosis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis. The administration of fairly small doses of gamma-globulins gives rise to a diminished clinical picture with longterm immunity, which, from the biological point of view, is extremely desirable. From clinical and in vitro experiments (Dr. med. H. Veith, chief physician: Nachweis des sogenannten Sch\u00e4rfungseffektes von hom\u00f6opathisiertem Gammaglobulin in vivo und in vitro (Evidence of the enhancing effect of homoeopathically adiusted gamma-globulin in vivo and in No. 6 1975, pp. Schedel's Clinic, Scientific Institute for Protogerontology, 8391 Kellberg), it has been possible to establish that this enhancing effect is also observed when a substance formed by the body itself, e.g. gamma-globulin, is administered in homoeopathically adjusted form. The results in detail: (a) The i.v. administration of Gamma-Globulin-Injeel within 14 days 5 times in succession to 50 patients with corresponding Indications (weakness of the defensive mechanism against infection) led to no alteration in the electrophoresis of the plasma protein, while, in particular, the gamma-globulin fractions showed no definite fluctuations. There were, therefore, no circumstances to be attributed eventually to the law of mass action. (b) Although Gamma-Globulin-Injeel effects no alteration to the percentage of human globulin in the organism, in all patients quite a considerable reduction in their propensity to infection could be observed. It was possible to confirm this objectively on the basis of two series of tests on in-patients during two epidemics of colds in February and April 1975, when an untreated control group of 105 + 94 patients (= 199 cases) was compared with a group of 73 + 84 patients (= 157 cases), each of whom had been inoculated intradermally once with Gamma-Globulin-Injeel (by needleless injector \"Dermo-Jet\"). (c) From immunological research the fact is known that sera containing immune globulin possess haemolytic properties. Since also in the potentiated form, gamma-globulin still contains immune globulin, the possibility was tested experimentally of determining the influence of the addition of homoeopathically adjusted gamma-globulin in the D10 potency on the haemolytic effect of immune globulin. It was found that through the addition of gamma-globulin in D10, a 30% higher haemolysis was recorded than when gamma-globulin alone was administered in the traditional dosage (50 corresponding in vitro experiments, the photometer deflection for the latter experiment being on average 11 and for the former, on average 16). The haemolytic effect of immune globulin can, therefore, be considerably intensified through the addition of homoeopathically adjusted gamma-globulin in the D10 potency, which corresponds to an enhancing effect and, therefore, could be established also in vitro and not merely clinically and experimentally (see above and under Vitamin B12- ml each.

All anabolics, however, always also possess certain androgenic properties, so that it must be expected that its use will lead to signs of virility in women patients (including an irreversible change in the voice) and premature signs of puberty in boys. Further side effects are the inhibition of spermatogenesis, accelerated maturation of the bones and cholestasis (the latter only after oral administration). Contraindications for all anabolics are prostatic adenoma and pregnancy.

Nervous insomnia, conditions of unrest, to aid weaning from an addiction. Penicillin-Injeel 0.275 ml each. Regarding the point of attack of penicillin, see above under Erythromycin-Injeel and forte. All penicillins and their derivatives relatively frequently cause a \"penicillin allergy\", when attention should be paid to a possible cross-allergy to cephalosporin. The possibility of the occurrence of lupus erythematosus resulting from the use of penicillin must also be guarded agalnst. Regarding penicillin allergy, resulting from the occurrence of penicillin antibodies in the human blood, the following additional information is of interest. The allergic reaction can manifest itself in the form of skin affections, urticarial eczema, etc. However, also rigor, fever asthma and other partially serious disorders are observed. Many authors give a forcible warning of the danger that too liberal penicillin medication, particularly in the form of ointments, pastilles to be taken orally, eye drops, powders and vaginal pessaries, etc., could lead to increasing proportions of the population becoming sensitized toward penicillin. The fairly long application of antlblotics can damage the normal bacterial flora so seriously that certain fungi (thrush) can then proliferate without restraint. Indications: Damage from penicillin, particularly penicillin allergy. In this case, desensitization or deallergizing procedure: for further details see above under \"Dosage\". Penicillin-Injeel and forte are not suitable for the treatment of infections which make penicillin or other antibiotics or sulphonamides necessary. Further spheres of application, according to O. Julian, include the following clinical pictures, symptoms and procedures. General exhaustion, the patient feeling well only when Iying down; eczema, urticaria, formation of warts; stabbing pains in locations, worsened by movement (e.g. Bryonia-Injeel S); neuralgia, supraorbital as well as behind the right eyeball (Chelidonium-Injeel, Sanguinaria-Injeel, Belladonna-Injeel S), disturbed sleep, the patient waking at about 2 a.m., conjunctivitis, blepharitis, protracted coryza, eczema of the auditory meatus, dry, sternum with palpitations, tachycardia, angina pectoris, paresthesia in the extremities, impressions on a yellowish brown tongue, aphthous stomatitis, constipation with oedema, fluor albus, articular and muscular pains, condition worsened by movement, damp and cold, with improvement at about 4 p.m., also by rest, with warm and dry weather. O.

Contraindications: Injeel forte: Pregnancy and lactation; and to small children. Petroselinum-Injeel D12, barbiturates have the following Contraindications, regardless of whether they are administered as hypnotics or to alleviate epilepsy: serious disturbances of the renal or hepatic functions, serious myocardial damage. Acute hepatic porphyria is a contraindication even when barbiturates are merely used as sedatives. The use of barbiturates as narcotics is prohibited, moreover, in cases of malignant hypertonia and in vagotonic conditions, such as status asthmaticus and vagotonic disturbance of the rhythm of the heart. Especially dangerous is the circulatory shock or collapse with serious vasodilation, a considerable decline in blood pressure and failure of the heart and respiration (see vagotonic conditions, above). Indications: The clinical pictures indicated above. In the homoeopathic reversal effect, favorable action may be expected in cases of blockage of the cerebral functions; also in cases of disturbances in the development of children. as well as for the consequences of the misuse of sedatives or soporifics, including the consequent somnipathy.

Phenothiazine is used in veterinary medicine as an anthelminthic. In human medicine (oxyuriasis), however, it has not been accepted, as it has toxic side effects (internal anemia, renal impairment, particularly nephrosis, as well as hepatic damage). All Contraindications and restrictions on use as well as the side effects, are shown in the \"Rote Liste\" (red list, 1979, under P 40. These comprise summarily all phenothiazine, the salivary and sweat glands, gastrointestinal disturbances, urinary disorders, disturbances of the haematopoiesis (agranulocytosis), cholestasia, provocation of epileptic attacks, corneal or lenticular deposits, disturbances in the conduction of stimuli. If skin reactions occur as a frequent side effect after the administration of phenothiazine derivatives (see above), it could be considered that lupus erythematosus might be present or that there was a pathological reaction to light. Indications: In accordance with the homoeopathic reversal effect for the above-mentioned symptoms, clinical pictures, etc., especially when these result from therapeutical damage after the application or abuse of psychosomatic drugs of the phenothiazine groups, or when such causation must be assumed.

Serotonin-Injeel D10, ml each. Serotonin-Injeel and forte, according to definition and action, can also be included in group C of the intermediary catalysts (q.v.), where, for example, corresponding directions will be found under Histamin-Injeel. The functions of serotonin: stimulation of the smooth musculature, the blood vessels, the bronchial tubes, the intestine and the uterus. In each case according to the initial condition of the circulatory RR-reducing or RR-increasing action (Wilder's rule of initial values). In this connection, the action of serotonin on the coronary-circulatory system is of a very complex nature, as direct and reflex effects make an analysis of the action very difficult. Serotonin is very greatly increased in the blood of carcinoid patients. Increased elimination of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (serotonin degradation product) in the urine can always be detected. Apart from the flushes (fitful red-cyanotic coloration of the face and neck), the following symptoms are frequent in these cases: diarrhoea, possibly, at first alternating with spasmodic atonic constipation; of Iycorexia with spontaneous hypoglycemia, polymorphous allergic dermatitis, cyanosis, tachycardia, tachypnea with a tendency toward attacks of asthma but also to attacks of migraine (serotonin or histamine headache in the form of a Bing-Horton syndrome (see above under Histamin-Injeel and forte). Further, in this connection, serotonin can also bring about endocardial fibrosis, with subsequent coronary insufficiency as a result of tricuspidal insufficiency and pulmonary stenosis (alterations, therefore, particularly on the right side of the heart). Serotonin and substances similar to serotonin can bring about psychotic conditions; on the other hand, investigations with Iysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), an antagonist to serotonin, showed that the psychodysleptic action of LSDis attributable to a repression of the serotonin of the neurone receptors, leading to the appearance of a schizophrenic onset (LSDintoxication). Indications: To be used experimentally for symptoms and clinical pictures as indicated above, in which disturbances of the serotonin metabolism can play a part; thus, for example, for headaches and the symptoms of a caroinoid syndrome. Allergic and toxic skin affections, e.g. after contact with octopods, salamanders, cuttlefish, ml each.

Contraindications: In cases of thyroid disorder with reduced iodine tolerance use only on the advice of a physician. Staphisagria-Injeel D12, D30, each. Staphylococcus D5 As single potency. Chronic and chronically recurrent diseases in which staphylococci, possibly in the form of a mixed infection or a secondary infection, are concerned causatively, e.g. myelitis, etc. Generally in retoxic phases based on damage through staphylococcus toxins, e.g. auto-aggression diseases as well as clinical pictures where the above-mentioned diseases are to be found in the anamnesis. Staphylococcus-Injeel can also be administered with good effect in myocardial impairment, liver, kidney and connective tissue damage, as well as in thyropathy. Especially good in association (always turns to bronchitis), laryngopharyngitis, bronchitis, pertussis, arthritis, the pavor nocturnus, dazzling changes such as weak impulses, inattentiveness, desultoriness, irritability, depression, psychotic patterns, hallucinatory psychoses, nightmares, stamping the feet. Symptomatically there is intolerance of noise, light and draughts, as well as weeping without cause, submissiveness, sensation of vibration of the vertebral column when Iying outstretched, as well as roaring in the ears, dysopia and a feeling that the lips are salty. Streptococcus haemolyticus-Injeel should always be included also in the treatment of auto-immune diseases, especially when there is a suspicion that streptococci have participated in the pathogenesis. Particularly effective in indications as for Streptococcus haemolyticus-Injeel but to be applied especially, however, in endocarditis lenta and sepsis lenta symptoms, as well as for lingering or typhoid feverish condltions, also for auto-immune diseases or as in phases. each. Streptomycin belongs to the group of aminoglycoside antibiotics. The Indications include, in addltlon to Gram negative cocci and bacteria, above all the tubercle bacilli. Contraindications for all aminoglycoside antibiotics are serious cardiogenic and nephrogenic secretory disorders. As side effects of this group of antibiotics, the following should be mentioned: renal damage, neuromuscular blockages, paresthesia, muscular pains. In addition to the nephrotoxic propertles of streptomycin, allergic reactions are known, i.e. in the form of urticarial eczema and generalized exfoliative dermatitis. Also liver damage and granulorytopenia after the administration of streptomycin are regarded as allergic. Above all, however, streptomycin is neurotoxic, with special affinity to the eighth cerebral nerve. In this connection streptomycin has a special affinity to the vestibular function (symptoms of vertigo, disturbances of equilibrium and gait), while dihydrostreptomycin has a special affinity to the cochlear function (hearing impairment extending to dysacousis and deafness). Cochlear damage, contrary to vestibular disturbance, is practically always irreversible. Indications: The above-mentioned clinical pictures, in particular symptoms of vertigo, disturbances of equilibrium and gait, but also hearing impairment such as tinnitus aurium, dysacousis and deafness, as also streptomycin, and not ml each chronic dislocations, especially of the talocrural articulation; fistulae of the bone; pustular skin affections; improvement of the pains in the limbs in warmth. Strophanthus compositum see combination Cardiac/circulatory decompensation; pulsation struma nodosa, cysts, with frequent calcification and occasional haemorrhages.

See under Strychninum nitricum-Injeel, indicated especially when symptoms of exhaustion are present at the same tlme. Sulfaguanidin-Injeel D12, D30, D200 0.367 ml of sparingly reabsorbable sulphonamides with the following Indications: enterocolitis, dyspepsia, summer diarrhoea, bacillary dysentery, before and after operations on the gastro-intestinal tract. Also for sulphaguanidine, the same Contra-Indications and restrictions of application as well as side effects apply as shown for the other sulphonamides, in systemic use. For further details, therefore, see under Sulfonamid-Injeel and forte. Indications: See under Sulfonamid-Injeel and forte, especially if the symptoms, disorders or clinical pictures are, or could be, causally associated with the consequences of intestinal disinfection (e.g. pre- and post-operative) with sparingly each. The sulphonamides can be described as enzyme poisons which concurrently inhibit enzyme systems in which para-aminobenzoic acid is active as coenzyme (e.g. growth factor H of yeast in Streptobact. plant.). The bacteriostatic properties of the sulphonamides are achieved, therefore, through their action as enzyme poisons, which leads, and must lead, to very many side effects, e.g. gastro-intestinal disorders, cholestasis, leucothrombopenia and possibly agranulocytosis. Sulphonamide fever can, on the one hand, be caused allergically but can also indicate serious toxic damage, such as hepatitis or haemolytic anemia. Contra-Indications for the administration of sulphonamides are: the last weeks of pregnancy, the period of lactation and the first weeks of life of the infant: danger of formation of sulphaemoglobin or methaemoglobin, as in the infant, physiologically, the methaemogiobin reductatse is not yet fully capable of functioning. In the Met-Hb-formation, a toxic metabolic product formed in the liver microsomes, p-hydroylaminobenzene sulphonamide, participates decisively. Further, this may lead to a pronounced sulphonamide allergy, indeed, in the form of sulphonamide fever (see above), but also in the form of renal and hepatic disorders (see above) and allergic skin reactions. Erythema exudativum multiforme (including in the case history) represents a contraindication for sulphonamide therepy. Indications: The clinical pictures indicated above, especially when these arise after treatment with sulphonamides, which may have been given a considerable time previously. Sulfur-Injeel S D12, D30, D200 As single potency. Reagent in all chronic diseases e.g. for irritating, weeping cutaneous eruptions, malodorous sudoresis of the armpits, pruritus (vulvae), hot flashes, scrofulous glandular swelling, dfficulty in falling asleep and in remaining asleep through the night (broken sleep); hot feet, the patient stretches them outside the bed; dirty appearance as if unwashed; characteristic burning and irritation of the skin and mucosa, worse in the warmth of the bed.

This essential aromatic amino acid is produced by putrefaction of proteins in the intestine. The breakdown products of tryptopohan are tube with tinnitus aurium and dysacousis; affections of the middle ear, e.g. of the middle ear. Tuberculinum-Injeel potency. According to Julian, the Indications of Tuberculinum cover tuberculosis and its specific manifestations, extending to successful therapeutic application in psoriatic, psychotic and, naturally, also tuberculotoxic disorders. The action of Tuberculinum is at its best when this nosode is not applied according to the isopathic principle, i.e. not in tuberculosis itself but in the sense of the simile law in similar diseases, i.e. those showing similar symptoms. This applies in general to all nosodes but most particularly to Tuberculinum for mental depression, tearfulness, hypochondria, daytime drowsiness, poor memory, worsening of condition by music (Julian); headaches as if the brain were encircled by an iron band, with nausea, occurring periodically in wet weather as well as when there is an odour of coffee, the pain occurring particularly over the right eye, also in school children, the condition being worsened by the slightest mental effort.

The vicariation between rheumatism and skin diseases is characteristic of Tuberculinum, in general a change of various phases. Typhoidinum-Injeel and forte See Salmonella Ubiquinone, in this case, is inserted as redox system in the respiratory chain, in which it has a coenzyme function, for which reason it is also known as coenzyme Q. Isoprene, from the point of view of nomenclature, can also be defined as a prenyl radical. Ubiquinone has a powerful regenerating effect on blocked respiratory enzymes. Indications All impregnation, degeneration and neoplasm phases, as well as for viral diseases, etc. Attention should be drawn to the ampoule preparation Ubichinon compositum , which, among other ingredients, contains almost all quinones in the therapeutically advantageous dosage, as well as to the preparation Glyoxal compositum, which contains glyoxal and methyl glyoxal (see chronically recurrent ulcera duodeni with exacerbation in the spring and autumn, to avoid recurrence.

See also \"Enhancing effect\" according to Veith D30, D200 0.367 ml each. The cobalamins have a ring system similar to porphyrin with a central trivalent coba. lt atom bonding a hexone base in the manner of a nucleotide. Vitamin B12 is an essential factor for normal growth in the widest variety of species of animals, for uninterrupted haematopoiesis (synthesis of nucleic acid) and the maturation of epithelial cells, especially of the intestinal tract. Various observations indicate that vitamin B12 participates in the transfer of labile methyl groups for the formation of methionine, and in this way is associated with the folic acid metabolism. The resorption of vitamin B12 on the part of the gastro-intestinal tract is already limited in healthy subjects and dependent on the concentration of the intrinsic factor. A part of the vitamin B12 is absorbed in the free form; the main quantity, however, only after bonding to the intrinsic factor, a mucoprotein, which bonds the cobalamins in stoichiometric proportions. In the liver, vitamin B12, like vitamin B6, promotes the protein metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum. Observations Clinical-experimental investigations/tests were carried out on 50 inpatients with corresponding clinical pictures (Senior physician Dr. med. H. Veith: Preliminary report on the possibility of preventing therapeutic damage through the simultaneous administration of homoeopathically adjusted allopathic remedies; Biologische Medizin, Vol. 4, No. 2/1975, pages 271-273 (cf. also report in No. 1/1975, page 255), Dr. Schedel's Clinic in 8391 Kellberg, Scientific Laboratory for Protogerontology), with injections of 1000 g vitamin B12 i.m., when, in each case, a haematogram was then produced with a reticulocyte count. These precursors of the red blood corpuscles are known to appear in increased numbers in the blood after the administration of vitamin B12. Usually, after several injections, however, the organism becomes dulled toward vitamin B12 through desensitization processes and no longer reacts so strongly with the production of reticulocytes. If vitamin B12 is injected according to the potency chord method in D10, D30, D200, i.e. as Vitamin B12-Injeel ( 1 ml), an increase in the number of reticulocytes occurs (mainly, however, only after the 2nd and 4th injection). These reticulocyte values, however, contrary to those of the 1st group, do not decline upon repeated injections. From the series of tests (see original literature) with \"concentrated\" and homoeopathically adjusted vitamin B12 ( vitamin B12-Injeel ), it was therefore possible to draw the following conclusions. 1. The homoeopathic medicament and the homoeopathically adjusted allopathic remedy are not subject to the law of mass action but serve to resensitize the body to its content of substances present in physiological concentrations, as well as toward substances administered. 2. The homoeopathic or homoeopathically adjusted medicament liberates the body's mode of reaction to the agent (= enhancing effect). Through simultaneous medication with allopathic remedies + homoeopathically adjusted allopathic remedies. it can be ensured that the organism does not become desenzitised in its detoxicating functions to the medicaments, which become inactive.
