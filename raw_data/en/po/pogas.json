It comprises general sports terms and vocabulary words specific to sports nutrition, with definitions provided for each. Sports nutrition refers to the practice of studying and providing the body with the right nutrients and energy to support physical activity and athletic performance. Proper nutrition is an essential aspect of an athlete's training and performance. Understanding these terms and the others that are often used in sports nutrition is crucial. By comprehending the terminology used, athletes can make informed decisions about nutrition planning to enhance performance and maintain good health and well-being. While enhanced performance, health and well-being is the goal of most athletes, knowledge is what gets them there. 1. Absorption Absorption is the process by which nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and other substances are taken up by the body after digestion. This process occurs mainly in the small intestine, where the nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream and transported throughout the body. Absorption is essential for providing the body with the nutrients it needs to maintain normal function. Foods that are high in fiber can slow the absorption of nutrients and should be consumed in moderation. The ideal amount of nutrients absorbed by the body depends on factors such as age, gender, weight, and overall health. 2. Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) is a range of intake for carbohydrates, fats, and proteins expressed as a percentage of total daily energy intake. The [AMDR](https://www.athleticinsight.com/sports-terminologies/amdr) provides guidelines for the proportion of macronutrients that should be consumed in a healthy diet. The AMDR for carbohydrates is between 45% and 65% of total daily energy intake, for fat it is between 20% and 35%, and for protein it is between 10% and 35%. These ranges are based on scientific evidence and are intended to promote optimal health and prevent chronic diseases. 3. Acclimatization Acclimatization is when the body adjusts to changes in the environment, such as temperature, altitude, or humidity. This process is important for athletes, climbers, and other individuals who engage in physical activity in extreme environments.
