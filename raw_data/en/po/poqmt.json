DESCRIPTION: CLARO contains puri/f_ied water, ethyl alcohol, and polyethylene glycol. INDICATIONS: CLARO is indicated for the treatment of otitis externa in dogs associated with susceptible strains of yeast (Malassezia pachydermatis) and bacteria (Staphylococcus pseudintermedius). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Shake before use. CLARO should be administered by veterinary personnel. Administer one dose (1 dropperette) per aected ear. The duration of eect should last 30 days.1. Clean and dry the external ear canal before administering the product. 2. Verify the tympanic membrane is intact prior to administration. 3. Remove single dose dropperette from the package.4. While holding the dropperette in an upright position, remove the cap from the dropperette.5. Turn the cap over and push the other end of the cap onto the tip of the dropperette.6. Twist the cap to break the seal and then remove cap from the dropperette. 7. Screw the applicator nozzle onto the dropperette. 8. Insert the tapered tip of the dropperette into the aected external ear canal and squeeze to instill the entire contents (1 mL) into the aected ear. 9. Gently massage the base of the ear to allow distribution of the solution. 10. Repeat with other ear as prescribed. Cleaning the ear after dosing may aect product eectiveness. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Do not use in dogs with known tympanic membrane perforation (see PRECAUTIONS).CLARO is contraindicated in dogs with known or hypersensitivity /f_lorfenicol, terbina/f_ine hydrochloride, or mometasone furoate. WARNINGS: Human Warnings: Not for use in humans. Keep this and all drugs out of reach of children. In case of accidental ingestion by humans, contact a physician immediately. In case of accidental skin contact, wash area thoroughly with water. Avoid contact with eyes. Humans with known hypersensitivity to /f_lorfenicol, terbina/f_ine hydrochloride, or mometasone furoate should not handle this product. PRECAUTIONS: Do not administer orally.The use of CLARO in dogs with perforated tympanic membranes has not been evaluated. The integrity of the tympanic membrane should be con/f_irmed before administering the product. Reevaluate the dog if hearing loss or signs of vestibular dysfunction are observed during treatment. Use of topical otic corticosteroids has been associated with adrenocortical suppression and iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism in dogs (see ANIMAL SAFETY). Use with caution in dogs with impaired hepatic function (see ANIMAL SAFETY).The safe use of CLARO in dogs used for breeding purposes, during pregnancy, or in lactating bitches has not been evaluated.ADVERSE REACTIONS: In a /f_ield study conducted in the United States (see EFFECTIVENESS), there were no directly attributable adverse reactions in 146 dogs administered CLARO. To report suspected adverse drug events and/or obtain a copy of the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) or for technical assistance, contact Bayer HealthCare at 1-800-422-9874. For additional information about adverse drug experience reporting for animal drugs, contact FDA at 1-888-FDA-VETS or online at http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth. PHARMACOLOGY: CLARO Otic Solution antibiotic which acts by inhibiting protein synthesis. Terbina/f_ine is an antifungal which selectively inhibits the early synthesis of ergosterol. Mometasone furoate is a glucocortico-steroid with anti-in/f_lammatory activity. MICROBIOLOGY : The compatibility and additive eect of each of the components in CLARO solution was demonstrated in a component eectiveness and non-interference study. An in vitro study of organisms collected from clinical cases of otitis externa in dogs enrolled in the clinical eectiveness study determined that /f_lorfenicol and terbina/f_ine hydrochloride inhibit the growth of bacteria and yeast commonly associated with otitis externa in dogs. No consistent synergistic or antagonistic eect of the two antimicrobials was demonstrated. The addition of mometasone furoate to the combination did not impair antimicrobial activity to any clinically signi/f_icant extent. In a /f_ield study (see EFFECTIVENESS), at least 10 isolates from successfully treated cases were obtained for S. pseudintermedius and M. pachydermatis. EFFECTIVENESS: In a well-controlled, double-masked /f_ield study, CLARO was evaluated against a vehicle control in 221 dogs with otitis externa. One hundred and forty six dogs were treated with CLARO and 75 dogs were treated with the vehicle control. All dogs were evaluated for safety. Treatment (1 mL) was administered once on Day 0 to the aected ear(s). Prior to treatment, the ear(s) was cleaned with saline. The dogs were evaluated on Days 0, 7, 14, and 30. Blood work and urinalysis were obtained on Day 0 pre-treatment and Day 30 at study completion. Four clinical signs associated with otitis externa were evaluated: erythema, exudate, swelling, and ulceration. Success was based on clinical improvement at Day 30. Of the 183 dogs included in the eectiveness evaluation, 72.5% of dogs administered CLARO solution were successfully treated, compared to 11.1% of the dogs in the vehicle-control group (p=0.0001). ANIMAL SAFETY: In a target animal safety study, CLARO was administered aurally to 12-week-old Beagle puppies (4 dogs/sex/group) at 0X, 1X, 3X, and 5X the recommended dose once every 2 weeks for a total dosing period of 28 days (3 times the treatment duration). No clinically relevant treatment-related /f_indings were noted in hearing tests, body weight, weight gain, or food consumption. CLARO administration was associated with post-treatment ear wetness or clear aural exudate, increased absolute neutrophil count, decreased absolute lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, suppression of the adrenal cortical response to ACTH-stimulation, decreased adrenal weight and atrophy the adrenal cortex, increased liver weight with hepatocellular enlargement/cytoplasmic change, and decreased thymus weight. Other potentially treatment-related eects included mild changes to AST, total protein, inorganic phosphorus, creatinine, and calcium. STORAGE INFORMATION: permitted 10\u00baC-30\u00baC (59\u00baF-86\u00baF). CLARO solution is supplied in a single-use dropperette in a blister. Each dropperette contains one 1 mL dose. CLARO is available in cartons of two, ten, or twenty dropperettes. Bayer (reg' d), the Bayer Cross (reg' d) and CLARO are trademarks of Bayer. \u00a92015 Bayer HealthCare LLC.
