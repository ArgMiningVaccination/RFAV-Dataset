While flu vaccine will not protect against COVID - 19, getting vaccinated will protect you and your family from getting sick from the flu at the same time as COVID - 19 is circulating and may al so potentially save healthcare resources in a season that could be particularly taxing. This year Everyone six months of age and older should get a yearly flu vaccine. o Children 6 months through 8 years of age, receiving the flu shot for the first time or those who have only previously gotten one dose of vaccine in this age range, should get two doses of vaccine this season \u2014spaced at least 4 weeks apart. Manufacturers now produce influenza vaccine for the U.S. market through different technologies (e.g ., egg-based, cell culture -based, and recombinant hemagglutinin vaccines, inactivated vaccine, High Dose, Intradermal, Intranasal). All vaccines for the 2021 -2022 seasons are quadrivalent . All of the 202 1-2022 egg-base d influenza and LAIV4 vaccine are made to protect against the following four viruses: o A/Victoria/2570/2019 B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage) -like virus For 202 1-2022, cell - recombinant -based vaccines contain: o Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) - or the nasal spray vaccine - is available for use during the 2021-2022 flu season. o The LAIV nasal spray is a quadrivalent vaccine that can be administered to people between 2 -49 years of age without contraindicat ions to the nasal spray vaccine. Recommendations for people with egg allergies are the same as the previous seasons: o People who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health o People who have symptoms other than hives after exposure to eggs, such as angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis; or who have needed epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention, also can get any license d flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health, but the vaccine should be given in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions. o Two completely egg -free (ovalbumin -free) flu vaccine options are available: quadrivalent recombinant vaccine and quadrivalent cell-based vaccine . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) recommend that all U.S. health care workers ( HCW) get vaccinated annually against influenza. Since 2002, Maine state law requires that healthcare facilities report data on seasonal influenza vaccine coverage among healthcare workers in their facilities annually to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC). As of 2021, healthcare workers employed by a licensed nursing facility, residential care facility, Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID), multi -level healthcare facility, hospital, or home health agency licensed by the State of Maine are required to show proof of season al influenza vaccination. o https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious - disease/immunization/providers/documents/Immunization%20Requirements%20for%20Health care %20Workers.pdf Infection Control Individuals with influenza -like Illness (fever of 100\u00b0F and cough/sore throat) should stay out of work or school/daycare for 24 hours after fever resolves without use of fever -reducing medication. If COVID -19 is suspected, the appropriate COVID -19 guidelines should be followed . Droplet precautions should be used for all suspect or confirmed influenza cases for 7 days after illness onset or until 24 hours after the resolution of fever and respirato ry symptoms, whichever is longer , while a resident is in a health care facility . If COVID -19 is suspected, the appropriate COVID -19 guidelines should be followed. Manage ill healthcare personnel (HCP) . Instruct ill personnel not to report to work and if at work to stop patient -care activities, don a facemask and promptly notify their supervisor they are ill. HCP with influenza or many other infections may not have fever or may have fever alone as an initial symptom or sign. Thus, it can be very difficult to dist inguish influenza from other causes, especially early in a person's illness. HCP with fever alone should follow workplace policy for HCP with fever until a more specific cause of fever is identified or until fever resolves. As of 2021, health care workers are requ ired to show proof of season al influenza vaccination . Some facilities may choose to have vaccine exempt healthcare workers wear a mask. Initiation and discontinuing dates are dictated by facility policies, not by Maine CDC. Prevention strategies for seasonal influenza in healthcare settings ar e available at: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/healthcaresettings.htm Updated 20 21-2022 Prevention and treatment of influenza in Long -term Care Facilities guidelines will be available at Maineflu.gov . Maine CDC will release a notification announcing the first confirmed influenza cases of the season . County level data will be available in the weekly report . Additional guidance is available for circumstances where both Influenza and Sars -CoV-2 are co - circulating: Testing and Management Considerati ons for Nursing Home Residents with Acute Respiratory Illness Symptoms when SARS -CoV-2 and Influenza Viruses are Co -circulating | CDC Laboratory The first 10 positive samples from each commercial laboratory or hospital should be sent for PCR confirmatio n and/or typing. HETL will accept samples from any facility willing to send their first 10 specimens (including outpatient facilities). Any suspect novel, or influenza strains which do not type, must be sent to HETL for confirmation. o Please send any sampl es on patients who have swine or avian contact to HETL as they are the only lab that can determine if the illness is due to swine or avian influenza. o Also, please submit any positive influenza samples from patients who have traveled to China or neighboring countries, have been exposed to poultry and develop flu -like symptoms. Please forward any suspected co -infections (positive for both A and B on a rapid test) to HETL for confirmation. Consider sending samples for PCR testing on any hospitalized patient wi th a clinically compatible illness and a negative rapid test with no other etiology determined. Facilities may be asked to submit extra specimens if the circulating strains are found to be different from the vaccine strains. Reporting Requirements Influenza outbreaks are required to be repor ted, and Maine CDC will assist with guidance and support once an outbreak is identified. Please report outbreaks by phone at 1 -800-821-5821 or by e -mail to disease.reporting@maine.gov (no confidential inform ation by e -mail please). o Outbreak definitions differ by facility type , but any sudden or unusual increase should be reported . o Long -term care facilities Two or more residents with respiratory illness when at least one has lab confirmation Suspect an outbreak with one laboratory -confirmed influenza positive case (by any testing method) . Influenza and SARS -CoV-2 testing should occur when any resident has signs and symptoms tha t could be due to influenza or COVID -19, especially when two residents or more develop respiratory illnes s within 72 hours of each other . o Acute care facility nosocomial outbreak One or more patients with laboratory -confirmed influenza with symptom onset greater than or equal to 48 hours post -admission . o School or daycare Greater than or equal to 15% absenteeis m among students where the majority of those absent report respiratory symptoms . Pediatric influenza -associated deaths are required to be report ed. Please report by phone at 1 -800-821- 5821 or by fax to 207 -287-6865 . Laboratory confirmed influenza hospital izations are required to be report ed. These can be reported as they occur or in aggregate on a weekly basis. o Individual lab reports with the hospitalization status (or patient location) indicated is sufficient . o Line lists submitted weekly are acceptable and preferred for facilities with high volume. Minimum information to be included on a line list is: Facility name Test date Test result (A, B, subtyping if available) Patient name (if lab submits reports electronically patient initials are suf ficient) Patient DOB Gender Some geography indicator (patient address, patient city, or patient zip) Hospitalization status o If your facility reports influenza results through Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) , check with your IT department to determine what field in your electronic medical record could be used to denote hospitalization status (ie. patient status, patient class, patient location etc.). This field can then be mapped to the HL7 message used for reporting laboratory results . For any IT que stions regarding this requirement , contact your HealthInfoNet representative . The HL7 field that will need to be populated is PV1 2 PatientClass . ELR message will only include the status at the time of collection, so if a patient is tested in the ER and th en admitted , the ELR might not be sufficient for reporting hospitalized cases . o Even if your facility reports electronically , a verification of hospitalizations is req uired . ELR information is not always correct and cannot be relied on as the sole informat ion source. Novel influenza is reportable. Cases with high suspicion for novel influenza include patient s with known agricultural exposures (swine, domestic birds, wild birds) . Please notify Maine CDC, and forward the sample to HETL for typing. Maine CDC appreciates reports of all positive influenza tests, by any testing method. These can be reported by fax to 207 -287-6865, by phone to 1 -800-821-5821, or through electronic laboratory reporting. Emergency Preparedness As in years prior, Maine's Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) will conduct statewide bed availability polls upon request. You can contact either the Emergency Communication Systems Coordinator (Nate Riethmann / nathaniel.riethmann@maine.gov / (207) 287 -6551) or your Health Care Coalition Chapter Coordinator (see below) to r equest a poll. We are already capturing some bed availability data via our ongoing COVID -19 daily polls, but we can easily create a new event for any influenza -related surges that occur and can include additional bed types as needed. Regional Health Care Coalition Coordinators: Central Maine HCC: Hannah Health care Coalitions may be able to provide logistical support to healthcare facilities in the event that a novel influenza strain is identified resulting in an abnormally high surge event. o Logistical support may include: emergency communications, strategic nat ional stockpile (SNS) resources such as medical countermeasures, medical volunteers, personal protective equipment (PEP), and supplies. The Maine CDC Pandemic Influenza Operations Plan can be accessed on line at www.maineflu.gov . In the event of local or spot shortages of antiviral medications, please contact the Northern New England Poison Center (NNEPC) at 1-800-222-1222 to report any above -average antiviral shortages. o The poison center will work with local providers and Maine CDC to identify sources of antiviral medications o Please provide the NNEPC with the following information: What drug and formulati on are you having difficulty ordering? How much are you attempting to order? From what pharmaceutical vendor(s)? Have you contacted any other facilities in the area? Any other supporting information; how long it's back -ordered, etc. If a surge occurs and h ospitals are becoming overwhelmed, Maine CDC can initiate a bed availability poll via the Health Alert Network (HAN).
