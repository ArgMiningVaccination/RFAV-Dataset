There are Assessment Schedules for each course in this policy. Eligibility Requirements for the Higher School Certificate To be eligible for the award of the Higher School Certificate students must have: Gained the Record of School Achievement or such other qualifications as the NSW Educational Standards Authority (NESA) considers satisfactorily Attended a government school, an accredited non -government school, a school outside NSW recognised by the NESA, or college of TAFE Satisfactorily completed HSC: All My Own Work or its equivalent Satisfactorily completed courses that comprise the pattern of study required by the NESA for the award of Higher School Certificate Sit for and made a serious attempt at the requisite HSC examinations. Pattern of Study To qualify for the Higher School Certificate, you must satisfactorily complete the Year 11 pattern of study comprising at least 12 units and an HSC pattern of study comprising at least 10 units. Both patterns must include: At least 6 units of Board Developed Courses At least 2 units of a Board Developed Course in English * At least three courses of 2-unit value or greater (either Board Developed or Board Endorsed Courses) At least four subjects. *Satisfactory completion of English Studies fulfils English requirements for the HSC. The course counts towards the six units of Board Developed Courses required for the award of the HSC. HSC Assessment: A Standards -Referenced Approach In the context of the Higher School Certificate a major requirement of the internal assessment program is to provide a summative measure of a student's achievement in each course based on: A wider range of syllabus outcomes than may be measured by external examination alone Multiple measures and observations made through the HSC course rather than a single assessment event. School- based assessment tasks are linked to standards because the tasks focus on o utcomes, they are valid instruments for what they are designed to assess, and where appropriate, the marking guidelines are related to the wording of the outcomes and the performance standards. Each task enables teachers to collect information about the students' achievement in relation to several outcomes, to award marks in accordance with marking guidelines and to provide constructive feedback to students on their performance highlighting their strengths and where they could make improvements. The marks awarded for each task should be commensurate with the quality of the response.

Assessment Procedures YEAR 11 : Assessment tasks will be scheduled from Year 11 Term 1 until Year 11 Term 3. These assessments will be based on the Year 11 course only. The maximum number of formal assessment for the Year 11 course is three. YEAR 12 : Assessment tasks will be scheduled to begin Year 11 Term 4 until Year 12 Term 3. These assessments will be based on the HSC course only. The maximum number of formal assessment for the HSC course is four (including the Trial Examination). While every attempt has been made to make the scheduling and nature of tasks as detailed as possible, students should note that the teaching program in each of the courses may require minor changes to aspects of some of the set assessment tasks. Students will be notified, in writing, of any alterations to the scheduling or nature of assessment tasks. Assessment Notification The Course Coordinator will distribute the 'Assessment Task' form (see Appendix), outlining the nature of the task, the outcomes assessed and the markin g criteria to all students and c oteachers. Each assessment task has two dates: Date Distributed and Due Date. Students will receive an 'Assessment Task Notification & Acknowledgement' form (see Appendix) and will sign and date when they receive the assessment task. Students must read all information provided and seek clarification of any issues before they sign the form. The c oteacher will also sign and date the form prior to sending it to the Course Coordinator. Students will receive a minimum of three weeks' notice for tasks, advising the due date, type of task, weighting of each task, assessment marking guidelines and outcomes bein g assessed. All assessment tasks are to be made available digitally by Course Coordinators (e.g. via email, Google Classroom, or other shared platform). If a student is absent, when the assessment task is distributed, the co teacher will make them aware when they return to school, they should seek out their coteacher to discuss the task and sign & date the 'Assessment Task Notification and Acknowledgement' form (see Appendix). They may request an 'Appeal' form (see Appendix) if they feel they have been disadvantaged. When a student returns to school from any absence, it is the student's responsibility to enquire about any work set during the absence. If this set work includes assessment task information, the student must contact the Course Coordinator concerned, to ensure that the correct information is received, and to apply for necessary re -arrangements to the scheduling of each task. Extensions are not provided for unauthorised leave from school. Assessment Submission Students will submit assessment tasks by handing in to the home school office by 9am Wednesday of the week they are due with a completed 'Assessment Coversheet' form (see Appendix). A member of staff will sign and date the receipt, giving the student their section and retaining the top with the task. Assessments will be given to the coteacher. Coteachers will send the task to the Course Coordinator. The task will be scanned and emailed to the Course Coordinator that day and the hard copy will be posted to the Course Coordinator. Assessment tasks submitted after the due date, or missed if an in -class task will receive a mark of zero '0'. The Course Coordinator will generate an N -warning letter if tasks are not submitted by the due date, requesting the stude nt completes the requirements by a new due date. Students must make a serious attempt at all assessment tasks. Students are responsible to make copies of all assessment materials prior to submission. In the event of an assessment being lost in transit, th e copy serves as an accepted copy of the completed assessment. In the case of examinations, it is the c oteacher's responsibility to ensure copies of all examinations are made and kept until the original has been marked and feedback provided to students . All in-class tasks completed under examination conditions must be completed under the same conditions by all students at all schools. This includes, but is not limited to, the duration of time spent on reading/writing/practical tasks, access to support mat erials, and the use of names or NESA numbers to identify students' work. Assessment Feedback The Course Coordinator will assess the work submitted and provide timely feedback (within two weeks) to students about what they are able to do and what they need to do in order to improve their level of performance. Students have the right to: receive feedback that assists them to review their work query the mark for an individual task at the time it is returned to them request a review of the calculation of the final assessment mark if they believe their final assessment rank is incorrect. The Course Coordinator will record assessment marks and VET competencies in their Markbooks on WAP Sentral. Students do not receive their final HSC assessm ent mark, however, they do receive their course rank and school based examination mark. HSC: All My Own Work & Malpractice All senior students must have completed the NESA course HSC: All My Own Work. Work submitted for assessments task must be the student's own work. Malpractice is the term used by NESA to describe situations where a student has submitted work which is not all their own work. Malpractice includes: Cheating in examinations Plagiarism or using material directly from books, journals , CDs, or the internet without reference to the source Submitting work composed by someone other than the student Offering false documentation or explanation in support of an appeal Non-serious attempt in an examination or assessment task, where work presented contains frivolous and/or objectionable material Assisting another student to engage in malpractice. A student involved in malpractice in the HSC examination will be disqualified from an award in that subject. Likewise, a student involved in malpractice within the school context of internal assessment will be given a mark of zero '0' for the task or the part of the task. This will be decided by the Assessment Committee, comprising of two Principals and the Head Teacher Access. Course Coordinators will inform the Head Teacher Access immediately and send copies of the task in question. Additionally: The information will be entered into the NESA Register of Malpractice in HSC Assessment Tasks A warning letter will be sent detailing further responsibilities required of the student Schools will follow the procedures of their Discipline/Welfare Policy. The Western Access Program attempts to assist students to avoid malpractice by: Ensuring all students have completed HSC: All My Own Work to be eligible for the HSC Teachers constantly reminding students of good and ethical practice Displaying signs in appropriate areas, explaining aspects of good practice. Illness /Misadventure in Relation to Internal Assessment Misadventure refers to any val id reason, other than illness, for not completing, submitting or being present for an assessment task. Whether an event will be considered to be a valid misadventure, warranting consideration, will depend on the circumstances of the event and the independe nt documentary evidence that is handed in to support the misadventure claim. If the illness/misadventure application is deemed to be valid, and therefore upheld, the student will complete the set task or an alternate task as soon as can be arranged, preferably on the next school day or, in exceptional circumstances, an estimate will be used based on assessment evidence. Invalid reasons for illness/misadventure will result in a mark of zero '0' for that task. A student who submits work late or misses an assessment task or examination without explanation will receive a zero '0' mark and have the task recorded as a non -attempt. On some occasions students are sick on the day of examinations or have significant issues that prevent them submitting work on time. If this happens students need to contact their school immediately and in the case of illness, provide a medical. certificate. When the student returns to school he/she must see the Head Teacher/In School Access Coordinator immediately to complete the 'Appeal' form (see Appendix). Illness/Misadventure on HSC Examination Day If you become ill or suffer an accident that affects your examination performance, you should submit an illness/misadventure application form through the Principal and not ify the Presiding Officer when entering the examination or as soon as possible. It is important that you attend the examinations where possible even if you believe your performance in the examination will be affected. If you cannot attend an examination because of illness or misadventure, notify your Principal immediately. You should never risk harm in order to attend an examination, or attend an examination against medical advice. You must obtain documentary medical evidence generally on the day of the examination to support your illness/misadventure application. If you did not sit the examination this evidence must indicate why you were unable to attend. Read more in the HSC Rules and Procedures guide . If you have an accident or an illness just before the examination, emergency provisions can be arranged. You should immediately notify the Principal in such a case. If you are late to an examination advise the Principal immediately and get to the examination centre as soon as possible. Once you have obtained your evidence, completed the form and handed it in to the school, the Principal will submit your application to NESA for processing. A panel will review your application and the supporting documentation before deciding to uphold or decline each component i n your application. Members of the panel will review your statements, the medical or misadventure evidence, plus the Presiding Officer and Principal's statements before making a decision. Each examination or component is treated independently which is why it is important to have comprehens ive evidence for each affected component. In the case of most Board Developed Courses, if your application is upheld, you will be awarded the higher of your examination mark and a mark derived from your assessment mark or unaffected components of your examination. In the case of the optional VET HSC examinations, if your application is upheld you will receive your examination mark or a mark derived from an estimate submitted by your school, whichever is higher. If your application is declined, you will be awarded the mark you achieved in the examination. If you were absent from an examination and your illness/misadventure application is declined, you will not receive any result in that course. This could mean that you become ineligible for the award of the Higher School Certificate. Appeals Procedures Marks awarded for each assessment task can only be queried within two days of the task being returned to the students. Any student who wishes to appeal against the conditions, administration or marking of a task, must do so at the time of the task, or when the task is returned to that student by completing the 'Appeal' form (see Appendix). The student needs to discuss the concern with the Course Coordinator, coteacher or In School Access Co-ordinator who will then refer the matter to be considered by the Assessment Panel. The Assessment Panel will consist of the Principal of the home school of the student, the Principal of the Course Coordinator and the Head Teacher Access. The student wi ll be informed of the result of their appeal within one week. It is important to understand that NESA has specifically stated that a teacher's judgement of the worth of individual assessment tasks, as reflected in the mark or grade awarded, will not be sub ject to review as part of this process. Students are able to appeal an assessment decision based on a misadventure. Details for this can be found on the NESA Assessment Certification and Examination website. In the event of any appeal, NESA requires the school to ascertain that the weightings specified by the assessment policies of each course conform with NESA requirements; the procedures used by the school for determining the final assessment mark conform with its stated policy and there are no computational or computer errors in the determination of the assessment mark. Provided that the school has fulfilled these conditions, no changes will be made to the assessment mark. The student may make a subsequent appeal to NESA, but only on the grounds that the review made by the school did not comply with NESA requirements. NESA will not change the school assessment marks but, if some changes are considered necessary, may request the school to conduct a further review using amended . Completing Course Requirements NESA has delegated to Principals the authority to determine if students seeking the award of the Higher School Certificate at their school have satisfactorily completed each Board Developed and/or Board Endorsed Course in which they are enrolled in accordance with the requirements issued by NESA. Principals therefore will determine if there is sufficient evidence that each student has applied himself/herself with diligence and sustained effort to the set tasks and experiences provided in the course by the school. Any course for which the Principal makes an 'N' Determination will not appear on any NESA credential. Students who receive an 'N' Determination in any Year 11 course may be permitted to proceed to the HSC course provisionally while concurrently satisfying any outstanding Year 11 course requirements. Students who receive an 'N' Determination in any HSC course will have neither a moderated assessment mark nor an examination mark awarded for that course in that year. In addition to any other set tasks and experiences in any HSC course, students must complete HSC assessment tasks that contribute in excess of 50 per cent of available marks . If it appears that a student is at risk of not meeting the course requirements, a warning must be given. The Course Coordinator will follow the WAP process to issue a warning letter. Your School Principal will sign and distribute this letter. If, at any time, it appears that a student is at risk of receiving an 'N' Determination in any course for any reason, the Principal must advise the student of the possible consequences of an 'N' Determination in a course on Higher School Certificate eligibility. The Principal must: advise the student in writing a time for the problem to be corrected advise the parent/caregiver in writing (if the student is under 18 years of age) request from the student/parent a written acknowledgement of the warning issue at least one follow -up warn ing letter retain copies of the warning notice(s) and other relevant documentation. The Principal's Determination is the initial decision made by the Principal under delegated authority from NESA. Where a Principal has determined that a student has not satisfied the NESA's requirements in a course, the Principal must advise NESA on the appropriate schedule. The procedures for a school review of an 'N' determination will follow those laid down for other school reviews of assessments as follows: A student seeking a review of an 'N' determination must apply to the Principal by the date listed in the NESA timetable of actions for schools . If the school upholds the appeal, the school advises the NESA by the date stipulated in the NESA timetable of actions for schools . If the appeal is declined, the student may appeal to NESA. The NESA review will focus on whether the school review properly and correctly considered the matters before it. Appeals must reach NESA by the date stipulated in the NESA timetable of actions for schools. NESA will advise students and Principals of the outcome of any appeal as soon as possible after the Higher School Certificate examinations. Students may appeal against decisions concerning aspects of the award of the Higher School Certificate and Record of Achievement on the following: student appeals against 'N' Determinations student appeals against assessment rankings in HSC courses. The Principal's Determination Form should be completed and a copy given, together with the Student Appeal Form, to the student, or forwarded to the student's home address. Principals must also advise the student's parent/caregiver in writing (if the student is under 18 years of age) of their right to appeal against the Principal's Determination. NESA will review appeals only on the information submitted with the School Review Principal's Report Form and the Student Appeal Form. No further information will be sought, thus copies of all warning letters must be provided. If a student does not wish to appeal, the Determination Form should be retained at the school. If the student's appeal is successful at the school level, the Principal's Determination Form, the Student Appeal Form and the School Review Principal's Report Form should be retained at the school. Notification must be sent to NESA so that the 'N' Determination can be removed. Principals are to complete and send to NESA the appropriate page of the School Review Principal's Report Form. If the student's appeal is unsuccessful at the school level, the Principal's Determination Form, the Student Appeal Form, the School Review Principal's Report Form and any other relevant documentation should be retained at the school unless the student wishes to appeal to NESA. The appropriate forms relating to 'N' schools. Non-Completion of Assessment Tasks It is the responsibility of the student to submit work by 9:00am Wednesday of the week of the assessment is date. Any task submitted late will receive a mark of zero '0' for the task. Students who feel they have a valid reason for submitting a task late should follow the procedures as set out under the heading 'Appeal' form (see Appendix). Students who feel that their performance on the task has been affected by factors outside their control e.g . illness or accident may wish to apply for special consideration. Students must formally apply by completing the 'Appeal' form (see Appendix). The application form is available from the In - School Access Coordinator (ISAC) and must be submitted within two school days of the students' return to school. The ISAC must give the application to the Head Teacher Access who will consult with the Assessment Panel to make a determination. Where possible the student or parent/caregiver should contact their ISAC (e.g. by phone) on or before the assessment date to explain the extenuating circumstances. It is important to note that: Students must pursue the illness/misadventure process. There is no onus on the coteacher or Course Coordinator to instigate this process. In the case of illness, a medical certificate or other appropriate supporting documentation must accompany an application form. Work submitted late without an application for illness/misadventure will receive a zero '0'; and an N- Warning letter will be sent to the student's home address. Misadventure refers to any valid reason, other than illness, for not completing, submitting or being present for an assessment task. Whether an event will be considered to be a valid misadventure, warranting consideratio n, will depend on the circumstances of the event and the independent documentary evidence that is handed in to support the misadventure claim. If the illness/misadventure deemed to be valid, and therefore upheld, the student will complete the set task or an alternate task as soon as can be arranged, preferably on the next school day or, in exceptional circumstances, an estimate will be used based on assessment evidence. Notice of foreseeable absences must be brought to the attention of the c oteacher or Course Coordinator. Students who cannot submit the task on or by the due date, for reasons beyond their control, can make a written application fo r an extension of time to complete the task at least two days prior to the due date, on the 'Appeal' Form (see Appendix). It is the student's responsibility to plan around foreseeable absences. The p rocess to apply for an Appeal using an 'Appeal' Form 1. Students must inform their c oteacher and Course Coordinator immediately and fully complete the 'Appeal' Form attaching any relevant documentation. 2. Students must ensure that parents/caregivers have signed the form 3. The student must submit the form to the ISAC who will sign it and then pass the application to the Head Teacher Access who will consult with the Assessment Committee to make a determination 4. The student, c oteacher and Course Coordinator will be notified of the decision. Where the result of an Assessment Task was affected for valid reasons by absence or other misadventure preventing presentation of part (or all) of the task for assessment, the school may use a mark based on a substitute task or, in exceptional circumstances, an estimate based on other evidence. Any substitute task should: Be based on the same components or outcomes as the original task Test or measure the same knowledge or skills as the original task As far as possible, be of comparable standard to the original task Be assessed in the same manner as the original task. Technical failures will not constitute sufficient grounds for the granting of an extension or misadventure. Students are expected to follow responsible practices in relation to the use of technologies, including th e maintenance of reliable and up to date back up copies, allowing sufficient time to deal with potential technical failures and the retention of printed backup copies. Students must ensure that electronic files are operable on standard school equipment. T his must be checked before submission. Each student is responsible for maintaining an updated copy of his or her assessment task on a suitable medium in a suitable program e.g. Word. Where a computer/printer malfunction occurs the backup copy must be subm itted. In the event of a student not attempting or not making a serious attempt on an Assessment Task, the Course Coordinator will: Award zero '0' for that task Record a zero '0' mark in the assessment record for the student Students who make a non -genuine attempt will be required to re -do/complete the task to a standard that meets the course outcomes as required by NESA Inform the parents/caregivers of the situation using an 'N -Warning' letter. In the case of invalid or non -discriminating tasks, the WAP Assessment Panel may authorise an additional task or an adjustment of the course weightings. Adequate warning must be given to students for an additional task. In extreme circumstances the Head Teacher Access may allow an invalid task to be completely disregarded. NESA may approve special examination provisions for the HSC Examinations if a student has a special need that would, in a normal examination situation, prevent him or her from: (a) reading the examination questions; and/or (b) communicating his or her responses. Principals have the authority to decide on and to implement special provisions for school- based assessment tasks including examinations. Assessment Schedule for VET Courses Assessment in VET courses is competency based. This means that students need to demonstrate that they have gained, and can apply the specific knowledge and skills for the unit of competency to be deemed competent in that unit. Evidence of competence will be collected in a variety of ways e.g. written tasks, practical demonstration, portfolio or assignment. Students may be deemed 'Competent' if performance in all required assessment activities is satisfactory, OR 'Not Yet Competent' if students are still developing skills and/or their performance is at an unsatisfactory level. There is no pass or fail. This means that a course mark is not allocated. For this reason, the assessment schedule for HSC VET courses is in a different format to other Board Developed Courses. Formal Assessment will be scheduled only when students have developed the necessary skills, and underpinning knowledge to demonstrate competency. The Trainer will keep a record of units of competency achieved. Students may request to see this record at any time to determin e their progress. Alternately, students will be supplied with a competency log for maintaining a record of units achieved. Students are entitled to seek advice about options for further training and assessment for competencies 'not yet achieved'. Students will also receive a report from the school each semester indicating competencies achieved to date. The achievement of units of competency, will lead to a Certificate at AQF Level I, II or III or a Statement of Attainment (SOA) towards the AQF qualificatio n. A transcript will be issued by the NSW Education Standards Authority on behalf of Public Schools NSW - Wagga Wagga, Registered Training Organisation (RTO) 90333 for successful completion. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is available by submitting e vidence of skills and knowledge relevant to the unit/s of com petency for assessment by the trainer. Credit Transfer will be given for units of competency previously achieved with another RTO. Refer to RTO Student Guide for further information and processes. Work Placement is a mandatory HSC component. A minimum of 70 hours must be completed during a 240 hour course. Note that: Students will not be permitted to participate in a Work Placement if they are not deemed 'work ready' by the trainer an 'N' determination will be issued if work placement is not satisfactorily completed. This means that the course will not count towards the student's HSC pattern of study. However, they will still receive a 'Statement of Attainment', which indicates the units of competency achieved towards the qualification the scheduled date for Work Placement is shown in the assessment schedule. The Optional HSC Examination is: independent of the competency based assessment requirements for the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) VET qualification optional for students completing the 240 hour course and is intended for Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) purposes only The satisfactory completion of the course will still appear on student's HSC if the optional examination is not undertaken. If students intend to use their VET course towards the calculation of the ATAR, the school must submit an estimated mark of their likely performance in the HSC. This will only be used in the case of an illness/misadventure appeal. Students will be asked to complete a Trial Examination to practise appropriate written tasks under examination conditions to determine the estimated mark.
