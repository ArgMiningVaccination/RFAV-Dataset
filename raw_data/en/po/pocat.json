However experts and medical research reviews have uncovered evidence that this is not really true at all! According to Dr. Charles B Simone, an immunologist and oncologist, there are more than 200 viruses that cause influenza and influenza-like illness and vaccines might be effective against only about 10% of all the viruses that cause the flu like syndromes. The Cochrane Collaborations and Lancet's published findings, which are relied upon as the golden standard in independently reviewed research, found that the vaccine does not prevent flu in babies, adults, or in the elderly populations. According to a [2008 Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews](http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD004879/vaccines-for-preventing-influenza-in-healthy-children), involving 51 studies and 294,000 children aged 6 months -2 years there was \"no evidence that injecting with a flu shot was any more effective than placebo.\" In children older than 2 years old, it was only effective 33% of the time in preventing the flu! In a [2006 study Cochrane](http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD001269/vaccines-to-prevent-influenza-in-healthy-adults) found that \"vaccination only reduced the risk of influenza infection by 6% and reduced the number of missed worked days by less than one day,\" after studying 48 reports including 66,000 adults!! Agreements between the [Lancet](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(11)70295-X/abstract) and Cochrane Database were reached in their reviews of over 5707 screened articles that \"Evidence for protection is lacking\" for flu vaccinations used in the elderly populations. So what's the harm? Well there are risks of serious harm and injury to those that receive the vaccine including narcolepsy, febrile convulsions, and even neurologic diseases such as Guillain Barre. In addition, there are many toxins and additives in the vaccines that have potential health and allergen risks including nerve toxic mercury derivatives and formaldehyde, corrosive sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, and cancer causing injectible aluminum.
