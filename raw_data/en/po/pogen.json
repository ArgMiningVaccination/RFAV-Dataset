Because Ayurveda emphasizes prevention of illness while encouraging maintenance of health through close attention to diet, lifestyle, and supplements, many turn to it for help creating a balanced body, mind, and soul. Just as we all have a unique fingerprint, we are all born with a unique composition that adds up to our unique balance of dosha. Many variables, including stresses, diet, relationships, and even the seasons and weather can affect the balance of our doshas. But lucky for us, there are many easy ways to bring all three doshas back into balance. (Discover your dosha [here!](https://chopra.com/dosha-quiz)) Bringing your body into balance with Ayurveda Agni, or digestive fire, is at the core of Ayurveda's definition of a healthy, resilient body. Here are a few of our favorite products to stimulate healthy agni: - Pungent Ginger and Ginger Tea supports digestion. - Ashwagandha rebuilds and nourishes the adrenal glands while reducing the impacts of stress. - Herbs such as Cumin Seeds, Coriander Seeds and Fennel Seeds can rekindle digestive fire while bringing balance back to the digestive system. - Triphala helps replenish and rejuvenate the tissues of the digestive tract. - Lower cortisol levels elevated by stress with Tulsi/ Holy Basil.
