This includes the consumables required and step -by-step directions accompanied by photographs. Important Information ATAGI has released guidance on the use of COVID -19 vaccines in multidose vials. It is up to vaccination providers to use the most appropriate method for each setting/situation. Routine practice involves drawing up and injecting with separate ne edles however an acceptable alternative recommended by ATAGI involves drawing up and injecting with the same needle. This is recommended by the Victorian Department of Health (DH) for the preparation of the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine to avoid the risk of unde r-dosing and is outlined in this document. (note: this risk does not apply to administration of the AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine) Use a new, sterile 23G or 25G 25mm length needle (or 23G/25G 38mm needle for people who are obese) and 1 mL syringe to draw u p each new 0.3 mL dose by re -puncturing the bung. Ensure each re -puncture occurs at a different site on the bung. Recap the clean needle using either a single -handed technique, forceps, or a suitable protective guard designed for re -sheathing. The needle m ust be properly recapped, and the sheath must not be held in the fingers. In the event of a needle stick injury during recapping, the needle and syringe must be discarded and incident recorded. Consumable Required for Each Pfizer MDV 38mm needle for people who are obese) Throughout the procedure, continue to perform a visual check of the solution and check for contamination. Quarantine the vial and dose syringes if particulates or discolouration are present. OFFICIAL OFFICIAL Recommended Step -by-Step Process 1 Initial set up for aseptic prep space. Required consumables and vial with 'use by' marked Performed hand hygiene and don appropriate PPE. Prepare aseptic workspace and assemble required consumables. Mark dilution / use by date and time - this is to be done prior to the vial being handed to the technician for preparation Suggestion to add small vial label with \"Dilutant added Date___ Time____. Discard 6hrs after dilution 6 -30\u00b0C\" 2 Concentrated vial being inverted Slowly invert the vial 10 times to thoroughly mix the concentrate suspension, DO NOT SHAKE . 3 Vial bung being wiped Wipe the vial stopper with a single use 70% alcohol swab and allow to dry . 4 3mL syringe attached to sodium chloride polyam p Draw up 1.8 mL of sodium chloride 0.9% into a 3mL syringe by attaching syringe directly to polyamp . Attach and prime a needle. 5 3mL syringe puncturing vial Slowly add the 1.8mL of sodium chloride 0.9% down the side of the vial ensuring entire contents transferred. Equalise vial pressure by withdrawin g 1.8 mL of air into empty diluent syringe before removing the needle from the vial. Place diluent ampoule and 3mL syringe in injection tray for checking. The diluted vaccine, in the vial can be stored or transported at room temperatures of up to 30\u00b0C for up to 6 hours.* 6 Diluted vial being inverted Slowly invert the vial 10 times to mix contents thoroughly, DO NOT SHAKE . 7 Vial bung being wiped Wipe the diluted vial stopper with a single use 70% alcohol swab and allow to dry. 8 1mL syringe with needle attached Firmly attach a needle to a 1mL syringe, draw up 0.3mL of air. 9 1mL syringe/ needle puncturing vial Puncture the bung of the diluted vial, equalising pressure by injecting the air into the vial. 10 Inverted vial + 1mL syringe / needle withdrawing dose Draw up 0.3 mL of the diluted vaccine into the 1mL syringe Adjust to remove air bubbles. Check volume withdrawn is 0.3mL.
