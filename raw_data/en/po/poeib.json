Find resources and more from the CMS Office of Minority Health: Health Equity Technical Assistance Program Disparities Impact StatementIf you're a health care provider who administers certain vaccines to patients with Medicare drug plans (Part D), it's important to understand that their drug plans generally pay for the vaccines and administration. This fact sheet explains vaccine coverage under drug plans and vaccine claims submission options. Part B Vaccines Medicare Part B covers vaccines and vaccine administration for: Flu Pneumonia Hepatitis B (for individuals at high and intermediate risk) COVID-19 Certain reasonable and necessary vaccines to treat an injury or exposure to a disease Part D Vaccines Drug plans cover all commercially available vaccines when they're reasonable and necessary to prevent illness, except those covered by Part B .Examples The shingles and tetanus-diphtheria-whooping cough vaccines are Part D vaccines. Even if a drug plan's formulary doesn't list all Part D vaccines, it must provide access when a physician prescribes a Part D vaccine to prevent a patient's illness.Treat vs. Prevent For example, if a patient gets a tetanus vaccination because of an accidental puncture wound, it' s a Part B-covered vaccine. However, if the patient gets a tetanus booster shot, unrelated to injury or illness, it's a Part D-covered vaccine.Part D Vaccine Administration Drug plans cover vaccine administration costs as part of each vaccine's negotiated price, including: Dispensing fee (if applicable) Sales tax (if applicable) Vaccine administration fee Vaccine ingredient cost MLN908764 June 2023 Page 2 of 6MLN Fact Sheet Medicare Part D Vaccines You can bill in- and out-of-network Part D vaccines and administration fees on 1 claim form if you provide both components. Drug plans may pay either a single vaccine administration fee for all vaccines or multiple administration fees based on: Product administration complexity Vaccine type Provider type variance Contact your patient's drug plan to learn about specific vaccine administration fees. Patient Cost-Sharing Starting in 2023, patients with Medicare drug plans will pay nothing out-of-pocket for adult vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Part 5, Section 11401 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires these vaccines to be free to patients and makes Part D vaccine cost-sharing consistent with coverage under Part B where the patient has no coinsurance or deductible. The patient may have to pay a vaccine administration fee at the time of service, but they can get reimbursed in full for this fee from their Part D plan.

If not, work with your patients and their drug plans for payment. Figures 1 and 2 show how in-network pharmacies can dispense, administer, and bill for Part D vaccines.
