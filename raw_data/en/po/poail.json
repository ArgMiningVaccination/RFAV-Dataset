For people who experience gastro-intestinal symptoms, it can be challenging to nail down the cause. Some may need to take a deep dive into what they eat, how their body feels and what changes bring relief. [Lynne Shinto, N.D., M.P.H.](https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/lynne-shinto-nd-mph) a naturopathic doctor at the Center for Women's Health, shares with us how an [integrative approach](https://www.ohsu.edu/primary-care/integrative-medicine) to digestive health can help. Patients who see Dr. Shinto may have constant stomach upset for many years or GI symptoms that come and go. Common symptoms include constipation, loose stools, bloating, or difficulty with weight loss. They may be looking for guidance about a healthy diet or other lifestyle changes. Even for visits unrelated to GI health, Dr. Shinto often addresses diet or nutrition because of the role it plays in overall well-being. \"A healthy diet is connected to so many other conditions,\" says Dr. Shinto, \"Even if someone doesn't come in specifically with GI upset, diet usually comes up.\" \"Bone health, diabetes, hypertension, dementia prevention,\" she adds. \"All these things are tied in to diet.\" Some patients find their way to Dr. Shinto because they have tried different treatments and are still experiencing stomach pain. Others may have already attempted eliminating some foods, such as gluten and dairy, but they are looking for further guidance. Many patients come after being referred by their primary care doctor. One way that Dr. Shinto's integrative approach is different than standard visits is that she spends 50 minutes with her patients. She also sees them for several visits. It is important to dedicate a lot of time to what can be a complex process. \"Diet is very hard, there are a lot of steps,\" says Dr. Shinto. \"I usually try to see people at least twice, sometimes 3-4 times per year.\" A core service she provides is what she calls unconventional food intolerance testing. Patients use a kit to test for delayed food hypersensitivity, as indicated by elevated IgG levels in the blood. Dr. Shinto cautions that foods identified by this type of testing does not necessarily mean that this food needs to be taken out of the diet. \"We look at all the foods that come up with higher levels of IgG and then do a food elimination/challenge diet,\" she explains. \"We do a clean diet, and then challenge each of the foods to see if a patient has a reaction.\" Even foods that cause symptoms or reactions can often remain in a patient's diet, just in smaller amounts. Dr. Shinto takes time to finetune details alongside patients so they find a diet solution that works for them. \"It's patient empowerment,\" says Dr. Shinto. \"You feel it yourself, and you don't forget that lesson.\" Visit the Center for Women's Health's [Complimentary and Alternative Medicine](https://www.ohsu.edu/womens-health/complementary-and-alternative-medicine) information or the [ Integrative Health Collaborative website](https://www.ohsu.edu/integrative-health-collaborative) to "}
