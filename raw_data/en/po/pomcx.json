Naturopathy believes nature has the innate power to heal. Naturopathy and Ayurveda treat the root cause of the disease. That takes time. We are time-starved. We go to Allopathy to heal our diseases as it acts faster. It's faster because rather than going to the root cause of the problem, it treats the symptoms. The quickness of Apophatic medicines come at a cost. Every time we take Allopathy medicines it leaves a trace of disease in the body. Do you know the difference between the quickly ripened mangoes and mangoes ripened naturally? Quickly ripened mangos tastes differently, it gets rotten quickly. In the same way, Allopathy medicines quickly make us healthy but this health has a severe long-term consequence. To approach the disease differently we need to understand how our body's natural healing power works. Our body is equipped with the powerful mechanism of self-healing. This mechanism is known as Immune System. Our Immune System Our immune system at the cell level is lead by white cells They are spread throughout the body. Our white blood cells circulate in blood vessels, lymphatic vessels i.e. veins and arteries. Like the police, they on constant patrol. When they find any pathogens (bacteria, virus or other microorganisms which can cause disease) they multiply and signals other cell types to do the same. This way they prepare to fight the enemy. The immune system differentiates self from the non-self. This way they know whom to fight. They fight pathogens as well as our own cells which are dead or faulty. The entire system works in a smart and well-coordinated manner. The more we are exposed to pathogens the more our system prepares to deal with them. It's a continues learning process. That is why teens and adults tend to get sick less often than kids.

These are; - Bone Marrow Most defense cells are produced and multiply here. They then migrate from the bone marrow into the bloodstream and reach other organs and tissues, where the defense cells mature and specialize. ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279395/)) - Spleen - Lymph Nodes Lymph nodes work like biological filter stations. They contain different defense cells, which trap pathogens and activate the production of specific antibodies in the blood. - Tonsils Due to their special position at the throat and palate, their defense cells come into contact with pathogens especially soon and can activate the immune system immediately. - Thymus Gland Certain defense cells are differentiated in the thymus. Among other things, these cells are responsible for coordinating the innate and the adaptive immune system. - Lymphatic Tissues in Bowel The bowel plays a central role in defending the body against pathogens: More than half of all cells that produce antibodies are found in the bowel wall. These cells recognize pathogens and other non-self substances and mark and destroy them. \"The gut is the seat of all feeling. Polluting the gut not only cripples your immune system but also destroys your sense of empathy, the ability to identify with other humans.\" Handpicked related post: [How food imbalance is ruining your health](https://wethecouple.com/2017/07/17/how-food-imbalance-is-ruining-your-health/) How Immune System Works? When we take medicines, medicines actually are facilitating our bodies' natural ability to heal from within. Each body cell is dynamic and has the ability to heal himself. It also makes new cells that replace those that have been permanently damaged or destroyed. When a large number of cells are destroyed the surrounding cells replicate to make new cells. They quickly replacing the cells that were destroyed. When a bleeding injury occurs anywhere in the body, blood vessels at the site contract and slow the bleeding. Next, blood platelets which come in contact with air, begin forming a blood clot where the injury is located. White blood cells then accumulate at the spot and destroy and digest dead cells by secreting special enzymes stored in small packets in the cells. That way, dead-cell debris is removed to make space for new cells to occupy. This extraordinary and complex process automatically stops when the healing is complete. This healing process is not just for injuries. It also takes care of normal, everyday wear and tears. Damaged, destroyed or dead cells are replaced in great numbers daily from our skin, mouth, intestines, and blood. Here is an interesting video to make it easier to understand: How we damage our Immune System? First, we need to know about our activities. What we do the whole day be divided in 5 parts. - Eat - Rest - Activity - Physical - Activity - Mental - Encounter Environment. (Air, water, atmosphere, noise, etc.) Most of our diseases are due to the excess or lack of above 5 activities. Your worry for money is your mental activity. Your overexertion is your physical activity. What and how much you eat, how much you rest, and how your surrounding atmosphere everything decides your fitness and wellbeing. Our immune system is damaged by our in-healthy lifestyle. Wrong selection of food, irregular lifestyle, inadequate rest, excessive and long medications, smoking and similar vices damages our immunity.

Many times, it becomes so damaged that it develops an autoimmune disease like type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. In these situations, it targets healthy cells. It cannot distinguish self from non-self. AIDS is a well-known such disease we know. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. A disease which weakens the immune system of the body.
