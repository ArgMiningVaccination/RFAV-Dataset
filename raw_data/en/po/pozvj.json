Anaphylactic or other allergic reaction to a previous dose of influenza vaccine.1,3 Avoiding subsequent immunization of individuals known to have had Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) within six weeks of a previous influenza immunization is prudent at this time.1,3 However, the potential risk of GBS recurrence associated with influenza vaccine must be balanced against the risk of GBS associated with influenza infection itself and the other benefits of influenza immunization.1,3 The relative and attributable risks of GBS after seasonal influenza immunization are lower than those after influenza illness.4 Precautions Egg-allergic individuals may be immunized against influenza using inactivated vaccine without a prior influenza vaccine skin test and with the full dose of vaccine, irrespective of a past severe reaction to egg.3 Egg-allergic vaccine recipients should be kept under observation for 30 minutes following the administration of inactivated influenza vaccine. Expert review of the risks and benefits of influenza immunization should be sought for individuals who previously experienced severe lower respiratory symptoms (wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing) within 24 hours of influenza immunization, an apparent significant allergic reaction to the vaccine or any other symptoms (e.g., throat constriction or difficulty swallowing) that raise concern regarding the safety of re- immunization.3 This advice may be obtained from the local Medical Officer of Health or other experts in infectious disease, allergy, immunology and/or public health or any combination of these specialties.3 Individuals who have experienced oculorespiratory syndrome (ORS) including those with a severe presentation (bilateral red eyes, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, facial swelling) but without lower respiratory tract symptoms, may be safely re-immunized.3 Advice of an expert should be sought before immunizing individuals who experienced ORS with lower respiratory tract symptoms.3 Although influenza vaccine can inhibit the clearance of warfarin and theophylline, clinical studies have not shown any adverse effects attributable to these drugs in people receiving influenza vaccine.3 Possible reactions See Product Monograph Pregnancy Not applicable Lactation Not applicable Influenza Vaccine Alberta Immunization Policy | Biological Products \u00a92023 Government of Alberta | Published: August 2023 | Page 3 of 4 Program Notes 1992 (approx.) - Influenza vaccine split virus Influenza split virus vaccine first used in Canada in approximately 1992.
