NES spent decades mapping out the energy and communication systems of the body. Collectively, these are called the human body-field, which acts as a control system for the body's physical activity. When the body field is underpowered or distorted, it's unable to run the body in an optimal way and the body's cells and systems may begin to fail. Symptoms often begin with simply feeling tired, but they can continue into just about any known health problem. PRO TIP: When we improve function of the body-field, and we combine this with good nutrition and lifestyle choices, the body's incredible healing system can take over and begin restoring the body to health. Here's the NES process! I use the NES scanning technology to provide you with a holistic wellness report in just seconds. This approach looks for the underlying problem(s) so we can address health concerns from their roots with their bioenergetic solutions. Scans can be done easily at my health studio. They are quick, simple and non-invasive. Or, if you prefer, you can choose to buy a scanner for yourself and scan from the comfort of your own home. A computer and internet connection is necessary! Once the scan is completed, the results will be sent to my portal. The NES system maps 440+ specific data points of the human body field within seconds and produces a full-color, easy to understand report. This detailed report provides an energetic road map of information and correction possibilities. At your scan consult, we will go over your results in detail and use what's found to begin to craft a health plan. Infoceuticals are liquid remedies that help to optimize the body-field's energy levels and information flow. (They are based on the STUNNING research being done on fourth phase and structured water). Once the body-field is optimized, proper communication can take place. A healthy body is all about energy and communication. Infoceuticals have helped thousands of people around the world. They are simple to take - involving only placing drops into a glass of water and drinking the water. Whether your coaching is by phone, in person, or online, the recommended remedies from your scan will be shipped to your home once the order is placed. If we work together in person, my service includes the use of the exciting NES miHealth device. This unique device uses PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) technology with NES Health's proprietary field correction signals. We work with safe, focused bioelectric stimulation that uses real-time biofeedback to give your body exactly what it needs. This can yield a lot of fast results. We also use it to clear away energy blocks and begin to rejuvenate your energy field before you ever leave the studio.
