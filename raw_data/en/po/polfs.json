My sister was in desperate need of talking to a counselor as she is very depressed. I talked to Kelly when I made the appointment and thought she was very nice and was looking forward to meeting her. We got there 15 minutes early and the door to her suite was locked with no note or anything say she was in session or would be back shortly so we waited awhile and then I called her and left a message telling her that we were there and waiting. We waited another 15 minutes and I called her again but never heard back so we finally left and never got a call. That night after I took my sister home I called Kelly again and said that I hoped that she was okay and that I was upset about her not being there and I have never heard back from her.
