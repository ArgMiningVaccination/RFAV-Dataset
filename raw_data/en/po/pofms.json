However, even if a vaccine only protects some people, it could have a major impact on controlling the epidemic. A partially effective vaccine could decrease the number of people who get infected with HIV; those people, in turn, would not pass the virus on to others. Even when an HIV vaccine is developed, education and other prevention efforts will be needed so that people continue to practice safe behaviors An ideal HIV vaccine should be able to elicit an immune response that recruits the appropriate effector mechanisms in order to render the organism resistant to infection. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), are an integral part of such a response, and thus, the development of vaccines capable of inducing strong, sustained, polyclonal, cross-reactive CTLs is a primary goal in HIV vaccine development. Ebola DNA vaccine works in Monkeys DNA vaccination, perhaps more precisely called DNA-mediated immunization, refers to the direct introduction by needle injection or particle bombardment into host organism tissues of a plasmid DNA (or an RNA) which is able to cause expression of an antigenic protein directly within the transfected cells. In this sense, DNA vaccination resembles a viral infection, since the biosynthetic machinery of the host is used for protein synthesis. This may result in secondary modifications of the synthesized antigen Harmless bacteria engineered to carry genes encoding HIV proteins Non-HIV viruses engineered to carry genes encoding HIV proteins; do not replicate completely "}
