Taking on this challenge, two cancer scientists at Houston Methodist and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have diligently sought more effective late-stage treatments, resulting in their creation of a new monoclonal antibody. Stephen Wong, PhD, from Houston Methodist Cancer Center, and Samuel Mok, PhD, from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, are collaborating to create an antibody as a new type of immunotherapy.Creating an Antibody to Fight Silent Killers Houston Methodist and MD Anderson Join Forces to Block MFAP 5 Protein in Ovarian and Pancreatic Cancers 5 In a study published in the July 22 issue of Clinical Cancer Research , co-corresponding authors Stephen T.C. Wong, PhD, from Houston Methodist Cancer Center, and Samuel Mok, PhD, from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, reported finding a new type of immunotherapy to fight the two deadly malignancies. They developed the monoclonal antibody to block the action of a protein, called MFAP5, which is secreted by the cells surrounding and supporting tumors in these two malignant cancers. The MFAP5 protein appears to trigger the formation of the surrounding elements that supply and stimulate the tumor as it grows and spreads. The monoclonal antibody 130A developed and patented by Wong and Mok is able to block MFAP5, pre - venting new blood vessels and excess tissue from forming and thereby cutting off the tumor's support for continued growth. Mok, endowed professor of gynecologic oncology and repro - ductive medicine at MD Anderson, states, \"MFAP5 promotes fibrosis in ovarian and pancreatic cancers, and fibrosis pro - motes progression, chemoresistance and reduces survival of people with these cancers. By blocking this secretory protein with an antibody, we can treat the tumor by targeting multiple cellular types\u2014fibroblasts and blood vessels\u2014in the tumor microenvironment.\" Having demonstrated the feasibility of using their monoclonal antibody to target MFAP5, the researchers are in the process of designing and generating an anti-MFAP5 antibody that can be used as a treatment in humans. They aim to have it ready for efficacy and toxicity testing by the end of 2019 and begin a Phase I clinical trial in 2020. \"The convergence of biological science, computational science and engineering has allowed us to achieve such translational discovery,\" Wong said. - Stephen T.C. Wong, PhD John S. Dunn, Sr. Presidential Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Engineering Professor of Computer Science and Bioengineering in Oncology Cancer Center Houston Methodist We found that blocking MFAP5 enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatments and suppresses tumor growth in ovarian and pancreatic cancers, as well as inhibits progression of these two cancers in mice. This new immunotherapy drug targets supporting cells surrounding a tumor rather than just the tumor cells alone. \" \" Wong and Mok created the antibody to block the action of the MFAP5 protein, secreted by the cells that surround and support ovarian and pancreatic tumor cells.

Chapman Foundation and the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund. The Monoclonal Antibodies Core Facility is supported by the Cancer Center Support Grant NCI P30CA016672.NeuralCODR was conceived by Philip Horner, PhD, and a team of faculty that understands the value of collaboration across disciplines. They come from institutions across the Texas Medical Center, including Baylor College of Medicine, Rice University, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) and MD Anderson Cancer Center. Two postdoctoral fellows have already begun learning firsthand about the distinctive opportunity to collaborate with clinicians and help provide clinical solutions based on their research experience. The year-long program includes a course of the participant's choosing based on their research interests, a clinical rotation, a case report and other components. Caroline Cvetkovic, PhD , is working in the Krencik Lab to study the relationship between astrocytes and neurons in the brain. She is developing human stem-cell derived 3D neural tissue cultures, used to study various aspects of development and degeneration, to gain insight into potential regenerative clinical therapies. Secondarily, she has developed an early model system of bowel organoids with innervation by human-derived neurons. With her background in developing smart bioengineered materials, she was determined that the projects she worked on have a significant impact in the near term. After taking an NIH course on translational research and understanding the direct application her postdoctoral work could have at the Houston Methodist Research Institute, Cvetkovic applied for the fellowship. \"As part of the NeuralCODR program, we have access to unique resources, like grand rounds and direct interaction with and advisement from neurosurgeons,\" said Cvetkovic. The NeuralCODR training allows her to collaborate directly with clinicians, researchers and patients to learn about actual patient needs and the clinical limitations when addressing them. Cvetkovic's clinical mentor is Gavin W. Britz, MD, MPH, MBA, FAANS. 6NeuralCODR Crosses Gaps between Systems Neuroscience fellows study connections between the central nervous system and organsFEATURES Caroline Cvetkovic, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Krencik Lab, studies the relationship between astrocytes and neurons in the brain.by Laura NilesA new Houston Methodist postdoctoral fellowship training program, Neural Control of Organ Degeneration and Regeneration (NeuralCODR), is designed to address gaps in mapping and studying how the central nervous system communicates with organ systems throughout the body. - Philip Horner, PhD Scientific Director, Center for Neuroregeneration Professor of Neuroregeneration Houston MethodistNeuralCODR is a novel program that brings together expert NIH-funded faculty across multiple institutions with a rich history of research training, clinical modeling and education to address the lack of collaboration and training among system or organ based laboratories and those focused on neural activity.\" \" Matthew Hogan, PhD , is working in the Horner Lab, studying the influence of neural activity on regeneration after spinal cord injury, stroke or other disease. He is developing an epidural stimulator and testing different frequencies of stimulation on the spinal cord to determine whether it can drive neural stem cell grafts to connect with local host circuitry. Hogan's goals are to apply his engineering training in the vascular system to that of neural stimulation paradigms for neural plasticity. For Hogan, his decision to train at Houston Methodist centered on the research acumen of Horner, access to clinicians and the resources and access to intellectual capital available within the TMC. Like Cvetkovic, Hogan wanted to make an impact on patient lives. \"I think we both came into the realization that we were doing something really neat-I was engineering heart tissue-but I questioned where I was going with it,\" said Hogan. \"I couldn't really see any translational potential, so I decided I wanted to make a change and do something that I may eventually see in my lifetime become a therapy.\" Hogan's clinical mentor is Brian D. Dalm, MD, assistant professor of neurosurgery. In addition to Cvetkovic and Hogan, the Center for Neuroregeneration is recruiting for two additional NeuralCODR postdoctoral fellows through the Paula and Joseph C. \"Rusty\" Walter III Neurorestoration Program Endowment.

And he applies this skill to what may be medicine's greatest mystery: the brain and how it works. Using multi-modal imaging and precision medicine to tackle dementia Shortly after arriving at Houston Methodist in 2014, Masdeu took a bold step. He reported his findings that neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's was associated with abnormal tau, a protein that forms inside cells from the normal tau that maintains the integrity of microtubules. At the time, most Alzheimer's experimental therapies focused on the amyloid protein. But Masdeu did not find a similar association with the amyloid protein, also found in this disorder. In April, Masdeu pushed forward with the concept that abnormal tau may spread in the brain through the normal brain highways, the white matter tracts that connect brain hubs to each other in a complex network arrangement. His study, published in The Journal of Nuclear Medicine , is the first to demonstrate this concept in vivo in humans. Using sophisticated neuroimaging, Masdeu and his team, particularly Belen Pascual, PhD, combined MRI and 18F-flortaucipir PET to study tau in a rare disease that affects the language-related syntactic brain network. The anterior node of this network, in the frontal lobe, was affected first. Sick neurons found here, containing tau, contacted and \"infected\" neurons in the separate, but connected, posterior node in the temporal lobe. The white matter tract connecting both nodes was affected, as would be expected when the neurons in the anterior node died first. This discovery reveals a window of opportunity for treatment, because to jump from neuron to neuron, tau appears to become extracellular\u2014and possibly amenable to immunotherapy using antibodies that target this abnormal protein. Several pharmaceutical companies are interested in this approach: Three clinical trials are currently underway at the Nantz National Alzheimer Center of the Houston Methodist Stanley H. Appel Department of Neurology using anti-tau antibodies from Abbvie, Biogen and Eli Lilly. - Joseph C. Masdeu, MD, PhD- Joseph C.

Under the guidance of Gavin Britz, MD, Candy and Tom Knudson Centennial Chair in Neurosurgery, surgeons and patients alike can use 360\u00b0 virtual reality to view the brain in preparation for complex neurosurgical procedures. Beyond 3D technology, the advanced 360\u00b0 technology allows surgeons and patients to walk inside an anatomical image. Wearing virtual reality headsets, the neurosurgeon and patient can tour the patient's pathology to increase their understanding of the condition and surgical treatment plan. In addition to offering comfort and reassurance to the patient, the technology is a powerful tool for providing surgeons with intraoperative visualization and navigation during complex surgical procedures. Bringing Texas' first Surgical Theater to neurosurgery 10 360\u00b0 11Aptly named Surgical TheaterTM, the visualization platform creates a 360\u00b0 visual by combining cutting-edge fighter jet flight simulation technology with a patient's anatomy scans. The scans draw on medical imaging that comes from CT scans, MRIs and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a special type of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging that maps the brain's white matter tractography, or nerve tracts. Britz, a teacher as well as a surgeon, highlights the technology's value as a tool for those who are not as skilled or experienced in advanced visualization. It also allows surgeons to give instructions, in real time, across long distances during procedures. Used in several major academic and private institutions in the U.S., Europe and China, Houston Methodist has the only system available in Texas. \"This technology can be a great equalizer for surgeons,\" said Britz. \"And linking it to artificial intelligence will develop even more efficient and effective processes for future surgeries.\" A good surgeon is like a commander, gathering intelligence and planning ahead as much as possible. The Surgical Theater allows that extra step\u2014a lifelike view\u2014to anticipate what we'll see and do before an operation. \"\" - Gavin W.

In the case of a blossoming project to measure the impact of both a real garden and a virtual environment on Houston Methodist Cancer Center oncology patients, the sign came first. While pointing to a nonexistent garden, it planted the seed for a new clinical study and potentially an innovative patient therapy. The misplaced sign appeared in the Outpatient Center, the work s ite of Renee Stubbins, PhD, RD, senior research oncology dietitian, and Ashley Verzwyvelt, RN, OCN, oncology infusion nurse liaison. After realizing the sign was a \"mistake\"\u2014a preliminary notice for future plans\u2014the two co-workers were inspired to make inquiries. They learned what was required and then submitted a proposal for a simple study to see what nature could do to improve patient health and wellbeing during infusion therapy. To the researchers' surprise and delight, the project grew exponentially. The Center for Health and Nature, the funding entity for the study, paired Stubbins and Verzwyvelt with Ann McNamara, PhD, associate professor and associate head of the Department of Visualization at Texas A&M University. McNamara added a virtual reality component, since not all study participants, such as those who are immunocompromised, can get outdoors. \"The Impact of Virtual Reality/Biophillic Environment on Distress and Pain in Oncology Patients\" is designed to observe 36 solid tumor oncology patients who receive infusions every two weeks for at least six cycles. The participants will be randomly assigned to one of three rooms at each visit: control, virtual reality or garden view. Data collection will occur in patients with various stages and types of cancer and will measure both subjective and objective components, including pain, stress, heart rate, blood pressure and saliva cortisol levels before and after infusion. As word of the endeavor spread, interest from community groups and charitable organizations continued to grow. The project now includes entities offering their work pro bono, including Skyline Art Services, landscape designers Asakura Robinson, the Trevino Group and others. It also attracted the attention of Houston muralist Mario Figueroa, Jr, better known as GONZO247, who has donated his talents to paint a gardenscape as part of the installation. On October 11, a ribbon cutting ceremony celebrated the official opening of the garden and mural installation, located on the 21st floor of the Outpatient Center. Data collection for the project is already underway. The next phase of the project will explore how the garden may support clinician wellbeing, when used as a retreat for staff as well as patients.

Holder, MD, Houston Methodist clinician scientist and assistant professor of surgery, is forging ahead with research\u2014with support from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas and Houston Methodist's Translational Research Initiative. Holder is working on a new surgical device to improve a heated chemotherapy treatment for peritoneal malignancies that line the abdomen. In the completion stages of in vitro study, the next phase includes in vivo work. As these studies continue, Holder is looking for the right concentration of gold nanorods to include in the film, how quickly the film heats in each study and how the chemotherapeutics release from the film. She aims to deliver the new device to the clinic within five to seven years. Referred to as ChemothermixTM, Holder's device uses a biocompatible, nontoxic film positioned by a surgeon to stay in place. It delivers chemotherapy by heating gold nanorods within the film once placed in the abdomen. Holder developed an interest in treating peritoneal surface malignancies as a fellow in surgical oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center. When tumors form within a gastrointestinal or gynecological organ, theoretically they grow through the organ wall and spread into the peritoneal cavity. The tumors then circulate in the naturally occurring abdominal fluid and plant throughout the abdomen. Current treatment includes two large, garden hose-sized catheters placed in the abdomen to input and remove heated chemotherapeutics. The entire abdomen is treated in similar fashion, often harming the intestines and diminishing quality of life for six months or more following the surgery. \"There had to be a more elegant way to treat these patients,\" said Holder, recalling what she experienced. \"We were manipulating patients' abdomens on the operating table to distribute the chemotherapeutics.\" Clinician scientist designs gentler delivery device for heated chemotherapy by Laura Niles- Jenny Chang, M.D. Emily Herrmann Chair in Cancer Research & Director, Houston Methodist Cancer CenterDave B, Gonzalez DD, Liu ZB, Li X, Wong H, Granados S, et. al.

With the help of thought partners and the support of philanthropic funders, ChemothermixTM now has the potential to change the future of cancer care. A mold for the ChemothermixTM film, which contains gold nanorods, was created in the Houston Methodist Machine Shop. The film delivers chemotherapy when heated.FEATURES 16 The Core of Discovery Houston Methodist partners to share in Good Laboratory Practice expertise Comparative Medicine collaborations provide access to GLP facilities and expertise for efficient FDA approval strategies, ranging from gene therapy for atherosclerosis to a medical device for closed-loop drug delivery. As director of Comparative Medicine, Tanya Herzog, DVM, DACLAM, oversees the plans and procedures for conducting preclinical studies. But a recent collaboration with Baylor College of Medicine and an industry partner also makes Herzog a co-investigator with George Taffet, MD, chair in geriatric medicine and professor of medicine in geriatrics and cardiovascular research at Baylor. The team is working on a study to test a gene-based therapy for treating, and possibly preventing, athero- sclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a major cause of heart attack and stroke in the elderly. Coronary artery disease costs the U.S. a billion dollars every year, with strokes and peripheral vascular disease adding another billion.This new gene therapy could offer an alternative to taking statin medications daily, which have compliance issues among other side effects. The gene therapy requires an initial application with three boosters, which may cover a span of 10 years. The adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy is derived from a technology developed by Kiromic Biopharma, a Houston start-up that received a small business innovation research grant (SBIR) with two sub awards totaling $850,531. Taffet initially developed a small animal model for testing the gene therapy. Impressed by the Comparative Medicine program's Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) capabilities, he requested Herzog oversee the efficacy and safety studies. Awarded $136,597 by Baylor College of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health (R42), the two-year study will soon begin its second phase. It is entitled \"Disease-limited AAV-FOXP3 Gene Therapy for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in Familial Hypercholesterolemia.\"GENE THERAPY Testing Gene Therapy Technology to Treat Cardiovascular Disease in the Aging Tanya Herzog, DVM, DACLAM by LaVonne CarlsonRey Calderon, BSME, MD, is a pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital and a University of Texas Mechanical Engineering Distinguished Alumnus. He is also an inventor ahead of his time. Years before nanotechnology and immunotherapy came to the fore, Calderon designed the OtricathTM\u2014a transportation pipeline with a visual communication catheter system that delivers a variety of agents, including today's nanoparticles, immunotherapies and stem cells, in an entirely new way, using a closed loop that minimizes systemic toxicity. \"The device finds the sweet spot between push and pull, separating the venous side and arterial side,\" said Calderon. \"The sweet spot is between the venous to venous approach and the arterial delivery, allowing the two sides to interact, saturating the area and then drawing out the toxic medication.\" In addition to faster drug delivery, the Otricath offers a safer alternative to arterial infusion systems, which deliver cancer drugs to the entire body, including organs where they're not wanted. Testing for the Otricath focuses on the liver, saturating an entire lobe containing several cancer tumors with multiple agents over time that are then withdrawn. An additional advantage is that an external port allows taking samples and analyzing results\u2014during delivery of treatment agents and using biopsies during treatment or for application in clinical trials that are testing new medications. Calderon devoted years to perfecting the device, tapping his original career as a mechanical engineer at Texaco. After attending medical school and completing his residency in 1981, Calderon identified the need for more precise drug delivery within the region of interest. He designed a push-pull process along the lines of a drill string using slant well oilfield technology and patented several designs between 2004 and 2011. Since then Calderon has worked with experts from Texas Children's Hospital and the Texas Heart Institute, and Stuart Corr, PhD, at Baylor College of Medicine, to develop the perfectly pressurized push-pull device. He also recruited a perfect business partner, his wife Delores Calderon, as operations officer. The Calderons applied and were accepted to the TMCx medical device inaugural cohort in 2016. They followed this with winning second place in Texas A&M's \"New Ventures\" competition in 2017. This past summer, working with Houston Methodist's Comparative Medicine program, MRI imaging and the Houston Methodist Institute for Technology, Innovation & Education (MITIESM), the Otricath achieved another translational milestone: using magnetic resonance imaging between the new and the old to confirm, in real time, that the Otricath's drug delivery is not applied systemically. MRI timing is crucial to the delivery process, while imaging and visualization impact the brain's ability to integrate and interpret never before seen spatiotemporal mapping data. GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) studies are on the horizon, with plans for going to market in the next few years. 17 Houston Methodist partners to share in Good Laboratory Practice expertise DRUG DELIVERY OtricathTM Inventor Taps Oilfield Technology for Closed-Loop Drug Delivery Rey Calderon, BSME, MD FEATURES 18Excitement was high among the 134 fellows and 81 faculty who attended the 2019 Houston Methodist Cardiovascular Fellows' Boot Camp: Laying the Foundation, hosted in August by DeBakey CV Education.

Whether gathering the strength to get through early morning exercise, finding time to study for the MCAT or pursuing a dream that sometimes felt distant, Sims has never backed away from challenges. With the strong work ethic his parents instilled in him, Sims knew he wanted to lead a life that would make a difference. Inspired by his mechanical engineer father and West Point's top-notch engineering program, Sims found it easy to pick a challenging major in mechanical engineering. Yet he always sensed he would study medicine and knew engineering had unique advantages and perspectives for those going into the medical field. When Sims heard about EnMed, he knew it was the perfect fit for him. \"EnMed was exactly what I had hoped for, but didn't even know it existed,\" Sims said. \"It's a breeding ground for innovators.\" Looking forward, Sims hopes to apply his foundation in innovation to taking care of patients. \"I will become a military physician and prioritize taking care of soldiers and their families,\" said Sims. \"I want to integrate innovation throughout my career, and the EnMed program will help me do that naturally. At the end of the day, I do this because I love people and I love my country.\"KENNETH SIMS EnMed Class of 2023 BS in Mechanical Engineering 2019 The U.S. Military Academy at West Point Cailin O'Connell believes in following her passions and letting the accolades come in their own time.

When it gets tough, I recall my deep calling to help people, and think of all the people who could be in my care in the future.\" CAILIN O'CONNELL EnMed Class of 2023 BS in Nuclear Engineering 2019 Texas A&M UniversityNEWS HIGHLIGHTS 22What I Did on My Summer Vacation At Houston Methodist, the enthusiastic answer is \"Research!\" by LaVonne Carlson Kiana Banafshay, shown with Sonia Villapol, PhD, in her lab, was assigned her own project. A highlight of the summer was presenting her poster at the MAPTA Summer Science Symposium, a grand finale that provided interns a forum for sharing their summer research projects. (Learn more about the symposium on page 29.) The summer of 2019 was well spent according to Kiana Banafshay, a pre-med student entering her senior year at the University of Texas at Austin. The 10-week Summer Undergraduate Research Internship achieved its goal of introducing highly motivated students to the excitement and challenges of research by pairing each one with a faculty member. The upshot for each intern is having a completed research project that shows their hard work. 23The 2019 program kicked off its ninth year on June 3, when Banafshay was introduced to 62 college undergraduates and high school students from more than 50 schools, including New York University, Brown University, Emory University, University of California-Berkeley, University of Southern California and Vanderbilt University. In addition to providing mentorship, the interns enjoyed networking opportunities and weekly didactic lectures with Houston Methodist leadership. For Banafshay, the lab experience opened her eyes to the possibilities of clinical research. \"I learned how to contribute to research projects within a laboratory and teamwork setting. I also learned several skills specific to preclinical research conducted in the lab and how they connect to clinical applications,\" said Banafshay. \"And I learned that science is fun!\" Banafshay was paired with Sonia Villapol, PhD, assistant professor of neurosurgery. The two knew instantly that they would make a great team. And early in the summer, they discovered they even share the same birthday! Villapol praised Banafshay as an exceptional student. \"Students bring an innate curiosity and passion, one that is my responsibility to help amplify by focusing on exciting research projects related to discovering new treatments for patients with brain damage and neurodegenerative diseases,\" said Villapol. \"There is nothing more rewarding in the laboratory than to mentor a team that shares my passion for science and scientific discovery.\" Villapol guided Banafshay through completion of her project, \"Brain-Gut Communication through Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide after Traumatic Brain Injury.\" Villapol's laboratory studies the inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms triggered after brain trauma or stroke, based on gender. It also investigates the contribution of peripheral signals and the gut microbiome to brain pathology, and pursues novel neurorestorative treatments for brain recovery through the lens of the periphery. NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Robotic Ultrasound Monitors for Stroke Houston Methodist is first in U.S. to use LucidTM Robotic System to monitor brain blood flow noninvasively 24by George Kovacik Neurological disorders, such as stroke, present a major health care burden, affecting more than 795,000 people in the U.S. annually. Stroke is a time-sensitive disease that requires rapid assessment and intervention. And assessing it incorrectly can lead to misdiagnosis and treatment delays, resulting in death or disability for patients. In June 2019, Houston Methodist was the first in the United States to offer the LucidTM Robotic System, a new robotic ultrasound system designed to non-invasively measure and display objective brain blood flow information in real time and detect cerebral embolization. The FDA-cleared, fully autonomous robotic platform combines an all-in-one neurovascular ultrasound device with a medical robotic headset to collect blood flow data under the guidance of a health care professional. The Lucid Robotic System (Lucid M1 Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound System\u00ae and NeuralBot System) addresses several clinical challenges. It minimizes the need for highly skilled personnel to apply the probes that detect and measure flow and it autonomously adjusts the detection process on a continuous basis. The assessments can be performed both in an inpatient or outpatient setting, potentially without the need for more invasive and costly tests. The technology provides clinicians with critical information that empowers them to assess neurological disorders. Alan B. Lumsden, MD 25 The new robotic system also makes the important monitoring technology available to a much larger group of patients and goes beyond providing just the initial neurological assessment. It can be utilized throughout the patient care chain: from bubble studies in the identification of right-to-left shunts, to monitoring for changes in cerebral blood flow velocities, to emboli monitoring during or after a procedure. \"At Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center, we are particularly focused on reducing stroke and are committed to providing the best care for our patients,\" said Alan B. Lumsden, MD. \"Being among the first centers to use the robotic ultrasound technology reflects our commitment to reducing the incidence of this life altering event. We think of this as a stethoscope to the brain.\" Integrating the LucidTM Robotic System gives clinicians a chance to look inside the brain at blood flow patterns in real time and rapidly identify physiological changes associated with neurological disorders, enabling efficient diagnosis and triage for treatment.\"\" - Alan B.

NEWS HIGHLIGHTS 26 Moving Forward with Music by LaVonne Carlson As a board-certified music therapist, Audrey Zybura, MT-BC, provides music therapy for patients on Houston Methodist's inpatient behavioral health unit. Specializing in acute psychiatry, the unit currently serves 17 patients, typically those who are facing significant psychological or emotional distress. Such difficulties may stem from challenging life circumstances or from living with conditions such as mood or psychotic disorders. One innovative tool the unit offers to help patients improve their mood is a custom-built individual music listening station. This station utilizes sound dome technology, designed to have unique acoustic effects. It uses a directional speaker to allow a patient to listen to music privately, while those outside the dome cannot hear the music playing inside. After a series of individual music therapy sessions with Zybura, patients can listen to a strategically created playlist including songs of their own choosing to improve their mood. \"Each playlist shows an emotional process the patient is facing and working to overcome or achieve,\" said Zybura. \"About seven songs are selected and organized to reflect a positive mood progression.\" Zybura explains that the selected songs can safely and reliably connect with the patient when experiencing a vulnerable state. They then help the patient process those difficult feelings and step gradually into a better mindset or mood. Music therapy is increasingly used to help patients find non-pharmaceutical ways to understand and regulate their emotions. Zybura assists patients in selecting songs that increase self-awareness, while guiding them toward a healthy outlet that can lead to positive emotional responses. Zybura is an employee of Houston Methodist's Center for Performing Arts Medicine (CPAM), which was originally established to address the specific health concerns of artists in the community. CPAM has grown to explore, research and apply the healing benefits of the arts in various ways, ultimately improving services for patients, families and artists alike. 27 Innovative companies seek opportunities to collaborate, and the arrival of Myra Cocker, PhD, is evidence of that. She came to Houston Methodist in June, representing Siemens Healthineers as a Senior Scientist and Collaborations Manager in Computed Tomography (CT). Cocker is part of the CT Research and Development Collaborations team, which consists of 11 scientists working with prestigious academic institutes across the U.S. Cocker relocated from Canada with a clear mission in mind: As a representative of Siemens Healthineers, she was charged with developing collaborations across the Texas Medical Center. She has already begun working with Houston Methodist investigators and clinicians in the Departments of Cardiology and Radiology, establish - ing scientific collaborations that explore the utilization of state-of-the-art CT systems, such as the Somatom Force CT scanner. Cocker is joining a team of Siemens Healthineers scientists already in place at Houston Methodist. Together, they share a common goal of facilitating research collaborations that utilize advanced Siemens imaging technology, including the new 3 Tesla MRI Siemens Vida, 7 Tesla MAGNETOM Terra, and the Biograph Vision PET/CT system at the Houston Methodist Translational Imaging Center. \"The programs and collaborations being developed will provide data and offer access to tools that are just beginning to emerge,\" said Cocker. \"Together, the Siemens scientists and TMC clinician researchers will develop novel imaging methods that reach beyond those currently in use for patient care.\" The high level of training Cocker brings to her new position leaves her well-equipped to explore the full capacity of new CT imaging technology. After earning her PhD in cardiovascular MRI imaging at the University of Calgary in Canada, she further pursued a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. There, Cocker focused on hybrid PET and CT cardiovascular imaging. Now in Houston, she is impressed by the Texas Medical Center.
