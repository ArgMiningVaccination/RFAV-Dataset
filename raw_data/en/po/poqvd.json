The word [Ayurveda ](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/the-ayurveda-experience)in Sanskrit means \"the science of life.\" The practice has been used in India for over 5,000 years, using natural and holistic means to boost health, wellness, and body/spirit balance. [Ayurvedic](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/ayurvedic-medicine-in-depth) medicine relies on the natural world of plants and some animal-based elements to heal, along with a regular regimen of exercise, a healthy diet, and a balanced lifestyle. The Ayurveda Experience Reviews: What Do Customers Think? Ayurveda is an ancient form of medicine practiced century after century. That fact alone makes products formulated under its guidance sound appealing, but even so, it's important that we find out if they truly work. To do so, this section of our [The Ayurveda Experience](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/the-ayurveda-experience) review is dedicated to customer feedback, and ahead, you'll find all sorts of comments and ratings we gathered from around the web. Let's start with a few close to home: - Turmeric Tangerine Youth Cream: 4.8/5 stars, 26 reviews - Daily Face Care Kit for Mature or Dry Skin: 4.9/5 stars, 192 reviews - Sandalwood Rose Age Defying Eye Butter: 4.8/5 stars, 474 reviews - Rujahari Oil: 4.9/5 stars, 217 reviews - Balaayah Black Gram Body Booster: 4.8/5 stars, 396 reviews Because the Sandalwood Rose Age Defying Eye Butter is such a popular product and we've been through our fair share of eye creams that don't work, we decided to check out the comments section. From what we read, it looks like this one truly does. Buyers said that it makes a huge difference in fine lines and discoloration, with many raving that it's the most effective cream they've ever used. One The Ayurveda Experience review read: \"It's a quick absorbing eye butter that smells warm and earthy...it glides on and is non-greasy. The skin around my eyes looks healthy and laugh lines are minimal! I'm 53...\" Younger women report the same effects, so in general, it looks like this product is beneficial for anyone looking to have younger-looking eyes \u2014 which is pretty much anyone over 30. For our next bit of feedback, we checked out [The Ayurveda Experience](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/the-ayurveda-experience) reviews page on Makeup Alley for the Kesaradi Oil. This oil rose to fame after a successful social media campaign in which thousands of women spoke out about its skin-transforming properties. There are just 4 reviews on Makeup Alley for this product, but all are quite detailed about their experience with it, in the end, awarding the oil a 4.8/5 star score. One review read: \"I am seriously amazed at the results of these oils, and I was after about 3 days. My skin is very calm and looks better each day; my skin feels so soft too.\" This customer also wrote about their finicky skin and adult acne, reporting that it didn't cause breakouts or irritation, just a soothing, calming effect. So far, it looks like those who try products from this brand really love them, but we set out in search of an in-depth review that might tell us a bit more about long-term results. After a little digging, we came across a The Ayurveda Experience review for the Manish Glow Elixir and Kesaradi Oil on a blog called Mum Knows Best. The review first mentioned the short-term effects after using the oils for 3 weeks: \"lovely and smooth and soft\" skin and disappearance of under-eye bags. Pretty good for short-term results. It was the long-term results that really impressed us though. Here's what the update on the review revealed: \"[My skin] feels smooth and soft and is starting to have something of a healthy glow. I have even been known to leave the house once or twice without even putting any makeup on! Also, I'm still only about half way through the bottles.\" First of all, for a bottle of skincare to last you for an entire year is unheard of, so we're super thrilled to read this about these oils. Secondly, feeling good enough about your skin to forget makeup is huge, especially for those who never leave the house without it. Overall, [The Ayurveda Experience](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/the-ayurveda-experience) reviews were nothing short of fabulous. Clean ingredients, skin-loving formulas, and real results is what we all dream of in our skincare routine that few products actually deliver. Is The Ayurveda Experience Worth It? Clean, effective, and natural skincare? Yes, please. [The Ayurveda Experience](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/the-ayurveda-experience) checks all the boxes of things we (and so many others seeking beneficial creams and potions) look for. And believe us, it's a rare occurrence. But it's not just the balanced skin care, hair care, and supplements that make this company an easy pick \u2014 it's the brand itself and how its products are formulated. Call us suckers for ancient medicine, but there's a reason it's lasted for centuries, right?
