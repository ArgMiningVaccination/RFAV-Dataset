Scroll down this page to discover more, click the download link to print the graphic or share on social media tagging [@britsocimm](https://twitter.com/britsocimm) and [@UKCICstudy](https://twitter.com/UKCICstudy) to help strengthen public understanding. We are committed to providing evidence-based information about COVID-19 and vaccination and continue to review and update our infographics as new research is published. We work closely with immunologists who are experts on the topic to make sure our infographics are accurate and reliable based on current available evidence. Research looking into different aspects of immunity against COVID-19 after infection and vaccination is ongoing, especially as new variants emerge. Knowledge of COVID-19 and vaccine immunology will continue to evolve and we will continue to monitor developments and review the information provided in this graphic. This infographic is accurate at time of publishing in February 2022. Vaccination induces an immune response in a safe way and significantly reduces your chances of developing COVID-19. Even if you've had COVID-19, vaccination will safely boost whatever immunity you have from previous infection.
