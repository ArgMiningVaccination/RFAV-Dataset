What started as only a temporary fix can then turn into a permanent addiction. A meditation therapy program helps clients manage the ups and downs of life without the need to self -medicate. Here's how a meditation therapy program for addiction really works. What Is a Meditation Therapy Program? Meditation therapy is not a program in itself. Instead, it is part of an overall treatment plan to help you beat addiction. It involves learning how to clear your mind and then train it to avoid negative thinking. For example, you may feel as though your situation is hopeless and consequently turn to drugs or alcohol to provide some relief. During mindfulness meditation, you will learn to think positive thoughts. This eliminates the desire to mask your unhappiness through substance abuse. How Does a Meditation Therapy Program for Addiction Work? Chances are you did not learn destructive behavior overnight. Your habits-including negative thought patterns-are something you developed over months and years. Changing those habits involves relearning certain ways of behaving and thinking so that you are not tempted to repeat old actions. With a meditation therapy program, you learn to clear your mind of unwanted thoughts and to focus on positive ones. You can also learn to calm anxiety so that when stressful situations arise, you avoid turning to illicit substances. Offered at many [PTSD Treatment Programs](https://www.pillarsrecovery.com/addiction-treatment-programs/dual-diagnosis-treatment-center-orange-county-ca/ptsd-treatment-program/), meditation is a valuable tool in the recovery process. Not only will it help you achieve sobriety, but you can also use it after your release to resist temptation and avoid a relapse. Benefits of a Meditation Therapy Program for Addiction Long-term substance abuse can dramatically alter brain processes. However, some evidence suggests that a meditation therapy program can actually reverse some of the adverse effects of drug use. A study performed by Harvard University revealed that meditation improves the brain's prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, scientists often refer to the prefrontal cortex as the happiness center of the brain. Meditating on a regular basis allows you to develop resilience. Resilience is the ability to bounce back from difficult situations. Specifically, developing a sense of strength can help you avoid the urge to use, and might even prevent a future relapse.
