They refine skills to provide a culturally responsive space for patients' values, desires, and health goals to arise and be centered in patients' care. Fellows learn from academic, experiential and community perspectives about a range and depth of modalities including lifestyle approaches, botanicals/supplements, mind-body medicine, whole medicine systems, and the Whole Health approach to care, consistent with the requirements of the American Board of Integrative Medicine\u00ae. Through this learning, fellows may serve as active partners with their community and other healing professions with an awareness of and respect for the culture and traditions from which these practices originate. View a slideshow of some of our hands-on educational seminars! This program also strongly emphasizes the incorporation of self-care. We acknowledge the systemic causes of burnout in healthcare professions while exploring how to support clinicians' senses of meaning, purpose, and resilience in their personal and professional lives. In this fellowship we create intentional space to discuss and practice shared values related to social justice, as developed by the UW Department of Family Medicine and Community Health [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee](/diversity/). We explore how an integrative approach to health care anchored in these values may contribute to the disruption of systemic and structural inequities that affect the health of the people and communities we serve. Qualifications - Applicants must hold an MD or DO degree - Applicants must have completed residency in family medicine or medicine/pediatrics with adequate primary care experience - Applicants may apply while completing their final year of residency - Applicants must be a United States citizen or a lawful permanent US resident with a resident alien permit or green card. The Integrative Health fellowship does not sponsor J-1 or other visas - The UW School of Medicine and Public Health has a deep and profound commitment to diversity both as an end in itself and as a valuable means for eliminating health disparities. As such, we strongly encourage applications from candidates who foster and promote the values of diversity and inclusion. Please review the [DFMCH Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion webpage](/diversity/)for more details. The UWAIHF Program is an American Board of Integrative Medicine (ABOIM) approved fellowship program in integrative health. Completion of a fellowship with the UWAIHF satisfies one of the eligibility criteria required by ABOIM to sit for the integrative medicine board certification exam offered by the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS). For more information on board certification in integrative medicine, see the [ABPS ABOIM webpage](https://www.abpsus.org/integrative-medicine). The UWAIHF Program provides 2 separate, but overlapping learning tracks that share the common goal stated above and prepare the learner to sit for the integrative medicine board certification exam. Overview: The Clinical Track is an approximately 1,400 hour, one-year program with the overall mission to develop expertise in incorporating Integrative Health as an overall approach to primary care and consultative practice. The Clinical Track provides the opportunity to develop a specific Integrative Health skillset or approach to care in which the fellow can become independently competent within the one-year period. Learning Objectives: A. Expertise in Integrative Health Practice: Develop expertise in incorporating Integrative Health as an overall approach to primary care and consultative practice. B. Familiarity with Non-Allopathic Approaches: Become broadly familiar with the most popular non-allopathic healing approaches in use in the United States. C. Expertise in Treating Specific Conditions: Gain expertise in the evidence-based use of Integrative Health for treating people with an array of acute and chronic diagnoses, including those that are minimally responsive to current mainstream biomedical approaches. D. Skill in Preventive Care/Self-Care: Obtain in-depth knowledge of preventive care practices, including modeling through personal self-care behaviors. Mindful awareness, in both professional work and self-care, is given special emphasis. E. Specific Integrative Health Skillset: Develop a specific Integrative Health specialty skillset (thoughtfully planned to accommodate the one-year period) and become fully proficient in the particular approach to care or the integrative care of a specific patient population of choice. Examples of past fellow's specialty skillset include in-depth trainings in herbal medicine, traditional healing, medical hypnosis, mindfulness-based stress reduction, guided imagery, acupuncture, osteopathic manipulation training for physicians, training with midwives and naturopaths in reproductive health, yoga teacher training, and personal trainer certification. Overview: The Faculty/Leadership Track is a two-year program that is approximately 2,800 hours. The FLT mission is to create physician leaders in the field of Integrative Health. Fellows in the FLT develop expertise in incorporating Integrative Health as an overall approach to primary care and consultative practice with the additional expectations of deepening the mastery of a specific skillset or approach to integrative care, and pursuing academic and leadership in the field of Integrative Health. This track is appropriate for those seeking to teach and/or lead, serve as faculty in an academic institution, or establish an Integrative Health clinic. Learning Objectives: The FLT Learning Objectives include all of the above listed Clinical Track Learning Objectives and in addition include: F. Greater Depth of Mastery of Specific Integrative Health Skillset: Deepen the mastery and proficiency of the specific Integrative Health specialty skillset or approach to integrative care with continued learning and practice and/or work with a specific patient population of choice. G. Academic pursuits: Develop and demonstrate Integrative Health scholarship by effectively sharing skills and expertise with others through a variety of means, including formal didactics, group facilitation, research, and/or writing. H. Leadership Pursuits: Cultivate leadership skills in Integrative Health through creating innovative programs, working with community groups, role modeling or contributing to institutional, regional, and/or national work in which UW Integrative Health is involved.
