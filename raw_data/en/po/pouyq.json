Most people especially the elderly can experience floaters which can be temporary. But presence of eye floaters can indicate a more serious underlying eye condition. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, eye floaters are viewed from a different philosophical school of thought and treatments exist in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat and cure eye floaters fully, be it temporary or chronic. But first let us understand what eye floaters are from a physiological perspective in Western Medicine. Symptoms of Eye Floaters When a person with eye floaters try to look at the floaters directly, the floaters will seem to move away. When the eyes stop moving, the eye floaters will keep drifting across the vision. The eye floaters will be more noticeable when the person look at something bright and blank such as the sky or a piece of paper. Risk Factors of Eye Floaters Eye floaters usually develop as we age, but there are some people who may have higher risk of getting eye floaters. - High degree of short sightedness - Have diabetes - Have had cataract surgery Causes of Eye Floaters in Western Medicine The causes of eye floaters are normally due to aging when tiny strands of vitreous which is the gel like fluid that fills the eyeball start to adhere together into thicker strands and cast shadows onto the retina which is the tissue layer that is light sensitive located at the back of the eye. The eye floaters are a result of the shadows that are casted by the strands of vitreous onto the retina. However there are also some other more serious conditions that can result in eye floaters formation. These are some of them: -Eye infections -Eye injuries -Eye inflammation -Internal bleeding of the eye -Vitreous detachment (when the vitreous pulls away from the retina) -Retinal tear (when vitreous detachment tears a hole in the retina) -Retinal detachment (when the retina pulls away from the back of the eye) Emergency Cases of Eye Floaters In cases when a lot of floaters appear suddenly, sometimes with light flashes or a dark curtain of shadow or blurred area at the side or center of the vision, these can indicate retinal tear or retinal detachment. When these happen, they are considered medical emergency that needs immediate medical attention. Causes of Eye Floaters in Traditional Chinese Medicine The way Traditional Chinese Medicine looks at the causation of eye floaters is entirely different from Western Medicine, which is exactly the reason why solutions are possible and available in Traditional Chinese Medicine to cure eye floaters. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the organ Liver opens up to the eyes (). This is based on the energy channel or meridian correlation in which the eyes lie on the path of the Liver meridian. Therefore in the case of eye floaters, the main organ affected is Liver and the exact way of treatment comes from the skill and experience of the Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor in identifying which type of syndrome differentiation of Liver imbalance the person with eye floaters is experiencing. The subsidiary organ that can result in eye floaters is Gallbladder. This is due to the close correlation between Liver and Gall Bladder in which they are seen as the paired organs in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is interesting to note that in my clinical practice, I see a pattern of patients with Gall Bladders surgically removed due to gallstones or other cholesterol issues have a higher occurrence of eye floaters and eye problems in later years of their lives. This is but a clinical observation I have noted in view of the correlation between Liver, Gallbladder and the eyes. And the common reasons for Liver and Gallbladder imbalances are [stress](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-stress-management), [poor eating habits](https://drxiangjun.com/tcmwellness/tcm-wellness-digestive-health), [high ](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-high-cholesterol) [cholesterol](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-high-cholesterol), alcoholism, abuse of drugs and chemicals such as prolonged ingestion of Western Medicine, manicure, pedicure or skin contact products containing steroids and heavy metals. Traditional Chinese Medicine Solutions for Eye Floaters For Traditional Chinese Medicine, treatments can be acupuncture, herbs and other modalities and are usually planned with differentiation of the eye floaters condition based on cause of disease, on the basis of clinical characteristics, and pattern identification. Acupuncture There are various techniques in [acupuncture](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-acupuncture) that are used to treat eye floaters. This require intricate skills of the Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor executing the treatment as the areas to acupuncture are highly sensitive and vulnerable given the close proximity to the eyeballs. Also a well learned Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor should know other acupoints that are specific for eye floaters treatment. Therefore, seeking out a skilled and credible Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor is of utmost importance in the treatment journey of eye floaters. Herbs There are formulas of herbs that can be catered for different imbalances of Liver and/or Gallbladder. Common herbs used for treating eye floaters include Goji Berries, Angelica Root, Astragalus Root, Liquorice. Single herbs treatment is too weak for curing eye floaters but a combination of the right herbs in the right amount will compound the effects for full recovery of eye floaters in time to come. Yoga Solutions for Eye Floaters Trataka Trataka is the practice in yogic tradition for purification of the eyes and a form of tantric meditation. It involves gazing at a single point such as a candle flame, a black dot, a small object. Spiritually, the practice of Trataka stimulates the pineal gland which can enhance concentration, focus, memory and intuition. Some says that when the eyes start to water during the gazing of the small object is when the clearance and purification of the eyes begin.
