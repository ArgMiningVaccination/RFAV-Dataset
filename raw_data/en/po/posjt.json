General Nesiritide (Natrecor \u00ae) is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved for the intravenous treatment of patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) who have dyspnea (shortness of breath) at rest or with minimal activity. Nesiritide is not self -administe red. B. Nationally Covered Indications N/A C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications Effective for dates of service on or after March 2, 2006, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has determined that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the use of Nesiritide for the treatment of CHF is not reasonable and necessary for Medi care beneficiaries in any setting. D. Other Effective for dates of service on or after March 2, 2006, this determination applies only to the treatment of CHF and does not change Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) discretion to cover other off -label uses of Nesiritide or use consistent with the current FDA indication for intravenous treatment of patients with acutely decompensated CHF who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity. 200.2 - Nebulized Beta Adrenergic Agonist Therapy for Lung Diseases - (Effective September 10, 2007) (Rev. 173, Issued: 09- 04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD -10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) A. General Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are characterized by airflow limitation that may be partially or completely reversible. Pharmacologic treatment with bronchodilators is used to prevent and/or control daily symptoms that may cause disability for persons with these diseases. These medications are i ntended to improve the movement of air into and from the lungs by relaxing and dilating the bronchial passageways. Beta adrenergic agonists are a commonly prescribed class of bronchodilator drug. They can be administered via nebulizer, metered dose inhaler, orally, or adrenergic agonist with racemic albuterol has been used for many years. More recently, levalbuterol, the (R) enantiomer of racemic albuterol, has been used in some patient populations. There are concerns regarding the appropriate use of nebulized beta adrenergic agonist therapy for lung disease. B. Nationally Covered Indications N/A C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications N/A D. Other After examining the available medical evidence, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services determines that no national coverage determination is appropriate at this time. Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act decisions should be made by local MACs through a local coverage determination process or case-by- case adjudication. See Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 617 (1984) (Recognizing that the Secretary has discretion to either establish a generally applicable rule or to allow individual adjudication.). See also, 68 Fed. Reg. 63692, 63693 (November 7, 2003). 200.3 - Monoclonal Antibodies Directed Against Amyloid for the Treatment (AD) is a currently irreversible brain disorder that progressively degrades memory, cognitive function, and ability to carry out tasks of daily living. AD is the number one cause of dementia in older Americans. Antiamyloid -beta monoclonal antibodies (antiamyloid mAbs) are laboratory-made proteins designed to bind a specific substance in the body, with the goal of marking it for destruction by the body's immune system. Scientists design various mAbs as treatments with the goal of targeting and neutralizing or clearing infections (like the COVID-19 virus), cancer cells, and in the case of AD, amyloid accumulation in the brain. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective April 7, 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) covers Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid for the treatment of AD when furnished in accordance with Section B under coverage with evidence development (CED) for patients who have a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD dementia, both with confirmed presence of amyloid beta pathology consistent with AD. Coverage Criteria: 1) Monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid that are approved by the FDA for the treatment of AD based upon evidence of efficacy from a change in a surrogate endpoint (e.g., amyloid reduction) considered as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit may be covered in a randomized controlled trial conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application. 2) Monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid that are approved by the FDA for the treatment of AD based upon evidence of efficacy from a direct measure of clinical benefit may be covered in CMS-approved prospective comparative studies. Study data for CMS-approved prospective comparative studies may be collected in a registry. 3) For CMS -approved studies, the protocol, including the analysis plan, must include: a. A study population whose diversity of patients are representative of the national population with MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia. b. A neurocognitive evaluation and a description of the instruments used to assess cognition and function for the clinical diagnosis of MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia for study enrollment and outcomes assessment. c. A description of: i. The multidisciplinary dementia team and optimal medical management. ii. Study sites with clinical expertise and infrastructure to provide treatments consistent with the safety monitoring outlined in t he FDA -approved label. 4) CMS -approved studies of a monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid (antiamyloid mAb) approved by the FDA for the treatment of AD based upon evidence of efficacy from a direct measure of clinical benefit must address all of the questions below: a. Does the antiamyloid mAb meaningfully improve health outcomes (i.e., slow the decline of cognition and function) for patients in broad community practice? b. Do benefits, and harms such as brain hemorrhage and edema, associated with use of the antiamyloid mAb, depend on characteristics of patients, treating clinicians, and settings? c. How do the benefits and harms change over time? 5) CMS -approved studies must adhere to the following standards of scientific integrity that have been identi fied by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ): a. The principal purpose of the study is to test whether the item or service meaningfully improves health outcomes of affected beneficiaries who are represented by the enrolled subjects. b. The rationale for the study is well supported by available scientific and medical evidence. c. The study results are not anticipated to unjustifiably duplicate existing knowledge. d. The study design is methodologically appropriate and the anticipated number of enrolled subjects is sufficient to answer the research question(s) being asked in the National Coverage Determination (NCD). e. The study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of completing it successfully. f. The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the FDA, it is also in compliance with 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56. In addition, to further enhance the protection of human subjects in studies conducted under CED, the study must provide and obtain meaningful informed consent from patients regarding the risks associated with the study items and/or services, and the use and eventual dispositi on of the collected data. g. All aspects of the study are conducted according to appropriate standards of scientific integrity. h. The study has a written protocol that clearly demonstrates adherence to the standards listed here as Medicare requirements. i. The stu dy is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Such studies may meet this requirement only if the disease or condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR \u00a7312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options. j. The clinical research studies and registries are registered on the www.ClinicalTrials.gov website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject. Registries are also registered i n the AHRQ Registry of Patient Registries (RoPR). k. The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 12 months of the study's primary completion date, which is the date the final subject had final data collection for the primary endpoint, even if the trial does not achieve its primary aim. The results must include number started/completed, summary results for primary and secondary outcome measures, statistical analyses, and adverse events. Final results must be reported in a publicly accessible manner; either in a peer -reviewed scientific journal (in print or on- line), in an on-line publicly accessible registry dedicated to the dissemination of clinical trial information such as ClinicalTrials.gov, or in journals willing to publish in abbreviated format (e.g., for studies with negative or incomplete results). l. The study protocol must explicitly discuss beneficiary subpopulations affected by the item or service under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations in the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are necessary. m. The study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to affected beneficiary subpopulations. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability or Medicaid eligibility. The principal investigator must submit the complete trial protocol, cite where the detailed analysis plan for the CMS CED questions occurs in the protocol, and provide a statement addressing how the study satisfies each of the standards of scientific integrity (a. through m. listed above), as well as the investigator's contact information, to the email address below. The information will be reviewed, and approved trials will be identified on the CMS Website. The Email address for protocol submissions is: clinicalstudynotification@cms.hhs.gov. The Email subject line should be: \"CED Monoclonal Antibodies for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease [name of sponsor/primary investigator]\" Monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid indicated for the treatment of AD are covered when furnished according to the FDA approved indication in National Institutes of Health (NIH) -supported trials. For any CMS-approved study, or NIH-supported trial, that includes a beta amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan as part of the protocol, it has been determined that these trials or studies also meet the CED req uirements included in the Beta Amyloid PET in Dementia and Neurodegenerative Disease NCD (220.6.20). C. Nationally Non- Covered Indications Monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid for the treatment of AD provided outside of an FDA -approved randomized controlled trial, CMS-approved studies, or studies supported by the NIH, are nationally non- covered. D. Other N/A. (This NCD last reviewed April 2022.) 210 - Prevention (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) 210.1 - Prostate Cancer Screening Effective/Implementation Dates: A. General Section 4103 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provides for coverage of certain prostate cancer screening tests subject to certain coverage, frequency, and payment limitations. Medicare will cover prostate cancer screening tests/procedures for the early detection of prostate cancer. Coverage of prostate cancer screening tests includes the following procedures furnished to an individual for the early detection of prostate cancer: Screening digital rectal examination; and Screening prostate specific antigen blood test. B. Screening Digital Rectal Examinations Screening digital rectal examinations are covered at a frequency of once every 12 months for men who have attained age 50 (at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last Medicare -covered screening digital rectal examination was perfor med). Screening digital rectal examination means a clinical examination of an individual's prostate for nodules or other abnormalities of the prostate. This screening must be performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in \u00a71861(r)(1) of the Act), or by a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife (as defined in \u00a71861(aa) and \u00a71861(gg) of the Act) wh o is authorized under State law to perform the examination, fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary's medical condition, and would be responsible for using the results of any examination performed in the overall management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem. C. Screening Prostate Specific Antigen Tests Screening prostate specific antigen tests are covered at a frequency of once every 12 months for men who have attained age 50 (at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last Medicare -covered screening prostate specific antigen test was performed). Screening prostate specific antigen tests (PSA) means a test to detect the marker for adenocarcinoma of prostate. PSA is a reliable immunocytochemical marker for primary and metastatic adenocarcinoma of prostate. This screening must be ordered by the beneficiary's physician or by the beneficiary's physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife (the term \"attending physician\" is defined in \u00a71861(r)(1) of the Act to mean a doctor of medicine or osteopathy and the terms \"physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife\" are defined in \u00a71861(aa) and \u00a71861(gg) of the Act) who is fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary's medical condition, and who would be responsible for using the results of any examination (test) performed in the overall management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem. 210.2 - Screening Pap Smears and Pelvic Examinations for Early Detection of Cervical or Vaginal Cance r (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04- 14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD -10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) Screening Pap Smear A screening pap smear and related medically necessary services provided to a woman for the early detection of cer vical cancer (including collection of the sample of cells and a physician's interpretation of the test results) and pelvic examination (including clinical breast examination) are covered under Medicare Part B when ordered by a physician (or authorized prac titioner) under one of the following conditions: She has not had such a test during the preceding two years or is a woman of childbearing age ( \u00a71861(nn) ) of the Social Security Act (the Act). There is evidence (on the basis of her medical history or other findings) that she is at high risk of developing cervical cancer and her physician (or authorized practitioner) recommends that she have the test performed more frequently than every two years. High risk factors for cervical and vaginal cancer are: Early onset of sexual activity (under 16 years of age) Multiple sexual partners (five or more in a lifetime) History of sexually transmitted disease (including HIV infection) Fewer than three negative or any pap smears within the previous seven years; and DES (diethylstilbestrol) - exposed daughters of women who took DES during pregnancy. NOTE: Claims for pap smears must indicate the beneficiary's low or high risk status by including the appropriate diagnosis code on the line item (Item 24E of the Form CMS-1500). Definitions A woman as described in \u00a71861(nn) of the Act is a woman who is of childbearing age and has had a pap smear test during any of the preceding 3 years that indicated the presence of cervical or vaginal cancer or other abnormality, or is at high risk of developing cervical or vaginal cancer. A woman of childbearing age is one who is premenopausal and has been determined by a physician or other qualified practitioner to be of childbearing age, based upon the medical history or other findings. Other qualified practitioner, as defined in 42 CFR 410.56(a) includes a certified nurse midwife (as defined in \u00a71861(gg) of the Act), or a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist (as defined in \u00a71861(aa) of the Act) who is authorized under State law to perform the examination. Screening Pelvic Examination Section 4102 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provides for coverage of screening pelvic examinations (including a clinical breast examination) for all female beneficiaries, subject to certain frequency and other limitations. A screening pelvic examination (including a clinical breast examination) should include at least seven of the following eleven elements: Inspection and palpation of breasts for masses or lumps, tenderness, symmetry, or nipple discharge. Digital rectal examination inclu ding sphincter tone, presence of hemorrhoids, and rectal masses. Pelvic examination (with or without specimen collection for smears and cultures) including: External genitalia (for example, general appearance, hair distribution, or lesions). Urethral me atus (for example, size, location, lesions, or prolapse). Urethra (for example, masses, tenderness, or scarring). Bladder (for example, fullness, masses, or tenderness). Vagina (for example, general appearance, estrogen effect, discharge lesions, pelvic support, cystocele, or rectocele). Cervix (for example, general appearance, lesions, or discharge). Uterus (for example, size, contour, position, mobility, tenderness, consistency, descent, or support). Adnexa/parametria (for example, masses, tenderness, organomegaly, or nodularity). Anus and perineum. This description is from Documentation Guidelines for Evaluation and Management Services, published in May 1997 and was developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the American Medical Association. 210.2.1 - Screening for Cervical Cancer with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing (Effective July 9, 2015) (Rev. 07-05-16; CWF analysis and design; 10-03-16 and MCS, and FISS Implementation; 01 -03-17 - Requirement BR9434.04.8.2) A. General Medicare covers a screening pelvic examination and Pap test for all female beneficiaries at 12 or 24 month intervals, based on specific risk factors. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7410.56; Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual, \u00a7210.2.1 Current Medicare coverage does not include the HPV testing. Pursuant to \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary may add coverage of \"additional preventive services\" if certain statutory requirements are met. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for services performed on or after July 9, 2015, CMS has determined that the evidence is sufficient to add Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing once every five years as an additional preventive service benefit under the Medicare program for asymptomatic beneficiaries aged 30 to 65 years in conjunction with the Pap smear test. CMS will cover screening for cervica l cancer with the appropriate U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved/cleared laboratory tests, used consistent with FDA approved labeling and in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) regulations. C. Nationally Non-Cover ed Indications Unless specifically covered in this NCD, any other NCD, by statute or regulation, preventive services are non -covered by Medicare. D. Other (This NCD last reviewed July 2015.) 210.3 - Colorectal Cancer and 1861(pp) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and regulations at 42 CFR 410.37 authorize Medicare coverage for screening colorectal cancer tests under Medicare Part B. The statute and regulations authorize the Secretary to add other tests and procedures (and modifications to tests and procedures for color ectal cancer screening) as the Secretary finds appropriate based on consultation with appropriate organizations. B. Nationally Covered Indications 1. Fecal Occult Blood Tests (FOBT) (effective January 1, 2004) Fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) are generally divided into two types: immunoassay and guaiac Immunoassay human epitopes. While most iFOBTs use spatulas to collect stool samples, some use a brush to collect toilet water surrounding the stool. Most iFOBTs require laboratory processing. Guaiac fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) use a peroxidase reaction to indicate presence of the heme portion of hemoglobin. Guaiac turns blue after oxidation by oxidants or peroxidases in the presence of an oxygen donor such as hydrogen peroxide. Most FOBTs use sticks to collect stool samples and may be developed in a physician's office or a laboratory. In 1998, Medicare began reimbursement for guaiac FOBTs, but not immunoassay type tests for colorectal cancer screening. Since the fundamental process is similar for other iFOBTs, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services evaluated colorectal cancer screening using immunoassay FOBTs in general. Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2004, Medicare covers one screening FOBT per annum for the early detection of colorectal cancer. This means that Medicare will cover one gFOBT or one iFOBT at a frequency of every 12 months; i.e., at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last covered screening FOBT was performed, for be neficiaries aged 50 years and older. The beneficiary completes the existing gFOBT by taking samples from two different sites of three consecutive stools; the beneficiary completes the iFOBT by taking the appropriate number of stool samples according to the specific manufacturer's instructions. This screening requires a written order from the beneficiary's attending physician. (\"Attending physician\" means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in \u00a71861(r)(1) of the Act) who is fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary's medical condition, and who would be responsible for using the results of any examination performed in the overall management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem.) Effective January 1, 2023, the minimum age for FOBT is reduce d to 45 years and older. 2. The CologuardTM - Multi -target Stool DNA (sDNA) Test (effective October 9, 2014) Screening stool or fecal DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, sDNA ) testing detects molecular markers of altered DNA that are contained in the cells shed by colorectal cancer and pre- malignant colorectal epithelial neoplasia into the lumen of the large bowel. Through the use of selective enrichment and amplification tec hniques, sDNA tests are designed to detect very small amounts of DNA markers to identify colorectal cancer or pre-malignant colorectal neoplasia. The CologuardTM - multi- target sDNA test is a proprietary in vitro diagnostic device that incorporates both sDNA and fecal immunochemical test techniques and is designed to analyze patients' stool samples for markers associated with the presence of colorectal cancer and pre- malignant colorectal neoplasia. Effective for dates of service on or after October 9, 2014, The Cologuard test is covered once every three years for Medicare beneficiaries that meet all of the following criteria: Age 50 to 85 years, and, Asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including but not limited to lower gastro intestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (iFOBT)), and, At average risk of developing colorectal cancer (no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis; no family history of colorectal familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer). Effective January 1, 2023, the minimum age for sDNA test is reduced to 45 years and older. 210.4 - Smoking and Tobacco-Use Cessation Counseling -10-23; Implementation:04- 10-23) Effective September 30, 2015 this section is deleted and the remaining NCD entitled Counseling to Prevent Tobacco Use (210.4.1) remains effective. 210.4.1 - Counseling to Prevent Tobacco Use (Effective August 25, 2010) (Rev.202, General Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and is a major contributor to the nation's increasing medical costs. Despite the growing list of adverse health effects associated with smoking, more than 45 million U.S. adults continue to smoke and approximately 1,200 die prematurely each day from tobacco- related diseases. Annual smoking- attributable expenditures can be measured both in direct medical costs ($96 billion) and in lost productivity ($97 billion), but the results of national surveys have raised concerns that recent declines in smoking prevalence among U.S. adults may have come to an end. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DH HS) Public Health Service (PHS) Clinical Practice Guideline on Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence (2008), 4.5 million adults over 65 years of age smoke cigarettes. Even smokers over age 65, however, can benefit greatly from abstinence, and older smokers w ho quit can reduce their risk of death from coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease and lung cancer, as well as decrease their risk of osteoporosis. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on or after August 25, 2010, CMS will cover tobacco cessation counseling for outpatient and hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries 1. Who use tobacco, regardless of whether they have signs or symptoms of tobacco- related disease; 2. Who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided; and, 3. Whose counseling is furnished by a qualified physician or other Medicare -recognized practitioner. Intermediate and intensive smoking cessation counseling ser vices will be covered under Medicare Part B when the above conditions of coverage are met, subject to frequency and other limitations. That is, similar to existing tobacco cessation counseling for symptomatic individuals, CMS will allow 2 individual tobacc o cessation counseling attempts per 12- month period. Each attempt may include a maximum of 4 intermediate OR intensive sessions, with a total benefit covering up to 8 sessions per 12- month period per Medicare beneficiary who uses tobacco. The practitioner and patient have the flexibility to choose between intermediate (more than 3 minutes but less than 10 minutes), or intensive (more than 10 minutes) cessation counseling sessions for each attempt. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications Inpatient hospita l stays with the principal diagnosis of tobacco use disorder are not reasonable and necessary for the effective delivery of tobacco cessation counseling services. Therefore, we will not cover tobacco cessation services if tobacco cessation is the primary r eason for the patient's hospital stay. D. Other Section 4104 of the Affordable Care Act provided for a waiver of the Medicare coinsurance and Part B deductible requirements for this service effective on or after January 1, 2011. Until that time, this service will continue to be subject to the standard Medicare coinsurance and Part B deductible requirements. (This NCD last reviewed December 2016.) 210.5 - Diabetes Screening Tests (Effective January 1, 2005) (Rev.) 210.6 - Screening for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection (Rev. Issued: 06- 29-17, 2, 2017 - analysis and design; January 2, 2018 - testing and implementation) A. General Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is transmitted by exposure to blood or blood- containing body fluids such as serum, semen or saliva. HBV infection attacks the liver and leads to inflammation. An infected person may initially develop symptoms such as nausea, anorexia, fatigue, fever and abdominal pain, or may be asymptomatic. An acute HBV infection may become a chronic infection and progress to serious and potentially life-threatening complications including cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. Pursuant to \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary may add coverage of \"additional preventive services\" if certain statutory requirements are met. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for services performed on or after September 28, 2016, CMS has determined that the evidence is sufficient to cover screening for HBV infection with the appropriate U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved/cleared laboratory tests, used consistent with FDA approved labeling and in compliance with the Cl inical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) regulations, when ordered by the beneficiary's primary care physician or practitioner within the context of a primary care setting, and performed by an eligible Medicare provider for these services, for beneficiaries who meet either of the following conditions. 1. A screening test is covered for asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults at high risk for HBV infection. \"High risk\" is defined as persons born in countries and regions with a high prevalence of HBV i nfection (i.e., 2%), US\u00adborn persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with a very high prevalence of HBV infection (i.e., 8%), HIV\u00adpositive persons, men who have sex with men, injection drug users, household contacts or sexual partners of persons with HBV infection. In addition, CMS has determined that repeated screening would be appropriate annually only for beneficiaries with continued high risk (i.e., men who have sex with men, injection drug users, household contacts or sexual partners of persons with HBV infection) who do not receive hepatitis B vaccination. 2. A screening test at the first prenatal visit is covered for pregnant women and then rescreening at time of delivery for those with new or continuing risk factors . In addition, CMS has determined that screening during the first prenatal visit would be appropriate for each pregnancy, regardless of previous hepatitis B vaccination or previous negative HBsAg test results. The determination of \"high risk for HBV\" is i dentified by the primary care physician or practitioner who assesses the patient's history, which is part of any complete medical history, typically part of an annual wellness visit and considered in the development of a comprehensive prevention plan. The medical record should be a reflection of the service provided. For the purposes of this decision memorandum, a primary care setting is defined by the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, clinics providing a limited focus of health care services, and hospice are examples of settings not considered primary care settings under this definition. For the purposes of this decision memorandum, a \"primary care physician\" and \"primary care practitioner\" will be defined consistent with existing sections of the Social Security Act (\u00a71833(u)(6), \u00a71833(x) (2)(A)(i)(I) and \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i)(II)). \u00a71833(u) (6) Physician Defined.\u2014 For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"physician\" means a physician described in section 1861(r)(1) and the term \"primary care physician\" means a physician who is identified in the available data as a general practitioner, family prac tice practitioner, general internist, or obstetrician or gynecologist. \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i) (I) is a physician (as described in section 1861(r)(1)) who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine; or (II) is a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant (as those terms are defined in section 1861(aa)(5)). C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on and after September 28, 2016: - Medicare beneficiaries who are symptomatic, or who have already been diagnosed with HBV infection, or who are nonpregnant and have already received a hepatitis B vaccination are non-covered. D. Other Medicare coinsurance and the Part B deductible are waived for this \"additional preventive service.\" (NCD updated September 2016) 210.7 - Screening for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and 10- 03-16 CWF Testing and Implementation, MCS, and FISS Implementation; 01 -03-17 - Requirement 9403.04.9) A. General Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is an infection caused by a retrovirus that affects the immune system. HIV infection causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease which severely compromises an individual's immune system. It is currently generally accepted that antiretroviral therapy (AR T) has significantly reduced HIV -associated morbidity and mortality throughout the world and the United States, and has transformed HIV disease for many, into a chronic, manageable condition. There is also evidence that the use of ART is associated with a substantially decreased risk for transmission of the virus to uninfected persons. Effective January 1, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is allowed to add coverage of \"additional preventive services\" through the national coverage determination (NCD) process if certain statutory requirements are met, as provided in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7410.64 (CMS began covering HIV screening effective December 8, 2009). One of those requirements is that the service(s) be categorized as a Grade A (strongly recommends) or Grade B (recommends) rating by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The USPSTF gives a Grade A recommendation to screening for HIV in: All adolescents and adults between the ages of 15 to 65 years, Younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk of HIV infection, and, All pregnant women. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on and after April 13, 2015, CMS has determined that the evidence is adequate to conclude that screening for HIV infection for all individuals between the ages of 15 and 65 years, as recommended with a Grade of A by the USPSTF, is reasonable and necessary for early detection of HIV and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B. CMS shall cover screening for HIV with the appropriate U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved laboratory tests and point -of-care tests, used consistent with FDA -approved labeling and in compliance with the Clini cal Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) regulations, when ordered by the beneficiary's physician or practitioner within the context of a healthcare setting and performed by an eligible Medicare provider for these services, for beneficiaries who meet one of t he following conditions: 1. Except for pregnant Medicare beneficiaries addressed below, a maximum of one, annual, voluntary screening for all adolescents and adults between the age of 15 and 65, without regard to perceived risk. 2. Except for pregnant Medicare beneficiaries addressed below, a maximum of one, annual, voluntary screening for adolescents younger than 15 and adults older than 65 who are at increased risk for HIV infection. Increased risk for HIV infection is defined as follows: Men who have sex with men, Men and women having unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse, Past or present injection drug users, Men and women who exchange sex for money or drugs, or have sex partners who do, Individuals whose past or present sex partners were HIV -infected, bisexual, or injection drug users, Persons who have acquired or request testing for other sexually transmitted infectious diseases, Persons with a history of blood transfusions between 1978 and 1985, Persons who request an HIV test despite r eporting no individual risk factors, Persons with new sexual partners, Persons who, based on individualized physician interview and examination, are deemed to be at increased risk for HIV infection. The determination of \"increased risk\" for HIV infection is identified by the health care practitioner who assesses the patient's history, which is part of any complete medical history, typically part of an annual wellness visit and considered in the development of a comprehensive prevention plan. The medical recommendation should be a reflection of the service provided. 3. A maximum of three, voluntary, HIV screenings of pregnant Medicare beneficiaries: (1) when the diagnosis of pregnancy is known, (2) during the third trimester, and, (3) at labor, if ordered by the woman's clinician. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on and after April 13, 2015: -Medicare beneficiaries with any known diagnosis of an HIV -related illness are not eligible for this screening test. -Medicare beneficiaries between the ages of 15 and 65 who have had a prior HIV screening test within 1 year are not eligible for HIV screening (i.e., at least 11 full months must have elapsed following the month in which the previous test was performed i n order for the subsequent test to be covered). -Medicare beneficiaries younger than 15 or older than 65, at increased risk for HIV -related illnesses, who have had a prior HIV screening test within 1 year are not eligible for HIV screening (i.e., at least 11 full months must have elapsed following the m onth in which the previous test was performed in order for the subsequent test to be covered). -Pregnant Medicare beneficiaries who have had three specified screening tests within each respective term of pregnancy are not eligible for further HIV screeni ng during their pregnancy.

Other N/A (This NCD last reviewed April 2015.) 210.8 - Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions in Primary Care to Reduce Alcohol Misuse (Effective October 14, 2011) (Rev. 138, Issued: 11- 23-11, Effective: 07- 02-12 CWF/HICR/MCS MCSDT) A. General Based upon authority to cover \"additional preventive services\" for Medicare beneficiaries if certain statutory requirements are met, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated a new national coverage analysis on annual screening and brief behavioral counseling in primary care to reduce alcohol misuse in adults, including pregnant women. Annual screening and behavioral counseling for alcohol misuse in adults is recommended with a grade of B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPST F) and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A and Part B. CMS will cover annual alcohol screening and up to four, brief face -to-face behavioral counseling in primary care settings to reduce alcohol misuse. CMS does not identify s pecific alcohol misuse screening tools. Rather, the decision to use a specific tool is at the discretion of the clinician in the primary care setting. Various screening tools are available for screening for alcohol misuse. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on or after October 14, 2011, CMS will cover annual alcohol screening, and for those that screen positive, up to four brief, face -to-face, behavioral counseling interventions per year for Medicare beneficiarie s, including pregnant women: Who misuse alcohol, but whose levels or patterns of alcohol consumption do not meet criteria for alcohol dependence (defined as at least three of the following: tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, impaired control, preoccupation w ith acquisition and/or use, persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to quit, sustains social, occupational, or recreational disability, use continues despite adverse consequences); and Who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided; and, Whose counseling is furnished by qualified primary care physicians or other primary care practitioners in a primary care setting. Each of the behavioral counseling interventions should be consistent with the 5A's approach that has been ado pted by the USPSTF to describe such services. They are: 1. Assess: Ask about/assess behavioral health risk(s) and factors affecting choice of behavior change goals/methods. 2. Advise: Give clear, specific, and personalized behavior change advice, includi ng information about personal health harms and benefits. 3. Agree: Collaboratively select appropriate treatment goals and methods based on the patient's interest in and willingness to change the behavior. 4. Assist: Using behavior change techniques (self -help and/or counseling), aid the patient in achieving agreed upon goals by acquiring the skills, confidence, and social/environmental supports for behavior change, supplemented with adjunctive medical treatments when appropriate. 5. Arrange: Schedule fol low-up contacts (in person or by telephone) to provide ongoing assistance/support and to adjust the treatment plan as needed, including referral to more intensive or specialized treatment. For the purposes of this policy, a primary care setting is defined as one in which there is provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and hospices are not considered primary care settings under this definition. For the purposes of this policy a \"primary care physician\" and \"primary care practitioner\" are to be defined based on two existing sections of the Social Security Act, \u00a71833(u)(6), \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i)(I) and \u00a71833(x)(2) (A)(i)(II): \u00a71833(u) (6)Physician Defined.\u2014For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"physician\" means a physician described in section 1861(r)(1) and the term \"primary care physician\" means a physician who is identified in the available data as a general practitioner, family practice practitioner, general internist, or obstetrician or gynecologist. \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i) (I) is a physician (as described in section 1861(r)(1)) who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine; or (II) is a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant (as those terms are defined in section 1861(aa)(5)). C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications 1. Alcohol screening is non-covered when performed more than one time in a 12-month period. 2. Brief face -to-face behavioral counseling interventions are non-covered when performed more than once a day; that is, two counseling interventions on the same day are non- covered. 3. Brief face- to-face behavioral counseling interventions are non-covered when performed more than four times in a 12-month period D. Other Medicare coinsurance and Part B deductible are waived for this preventive service (This NCD last reviewed October 2011.) 210.9 - Screening for Depression in Adults (Effective October 14, 2011) (Rev. 139, Issued: HICR, MCS MCSDT) A. General Among per sons older than 65 years, one in six suffers from depression. Depression in older adults is estimated to occur in 25% of those with other illness including cancer, arthritis, stroke, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. Other stressful event s, such as the loss of friends and loved ones, are also risk factors for depression. Opportunities are missed to improve health outcomes when mental illness is under -recognized and under -treated in primary care settings. Older adults have the highest ris k of suicide of all age groups. These patients are important in the primary care setting because 50 -75% of older adults who commit suicide saw their medical doctor during the prior month for general medical care, and 39% were seen during the week prior to their death. Symptoms of major depression that are felt nearly every day include, but are limited to, feeling sad or empty; less interest in daily activities; weight loss or gain when not dieting; less ability to think or concentrate; tearfulness, feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death or suicide. Based upon authority to cover \"additional preventive services\" for Medicare beneficiaries if certain statutory requirements are met, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated a new national coverage analysis on screening for depression in adults. Screening for depression in adults is recommended with a grade of B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefi ts under Part A and Part B. Therefore, effective October 14, 2011, CMS will cover annual screening for depression for Medicare beneficiaries in primary care settings that have staff -assisted depression care supports in place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow -up. Various screening tools are available for screening for depression. CMS does not identify specific depression screening tools. Rather, the decision to use a specific tool is at the discretion of the clinician in the pr imary care setting. Coverage is limited to screening services and does not include treatment options for depression or any diseases, complications, or chronic conditions resulting from depression, nor does it address therapeutic interventions such as phar macotherapy, combination therapy (counseling and medications), or other interventions for depression. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on or after October 14, 2011, CMS will cover annual screening up to 15 minutes for Medicare beneficiaries when staff -assisted depression care supports are in place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow -up. At a minimum level, staff -assisted supports consist of clinical staff (e.g., nurse, physician assis tant) in the primary care setting who can advise the physician of screening results and who can facilitate and coordinate referrals to mental health treatment. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications Screening for depression is non-covered when performed more than one time in a 12-month period. In addition, self- help materials, telephone calls, and web -based counseling are not separately reimbursable by Medicare and are not part of this NCD. D. Other Medicare coinsurance and Part B deductible are waived f or this preventive service (This NCD last reviewed October 2011.) 210.10 - Screening for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and High Intensity Behavioral Counseling (HIBC) to Prevent 141, Issued: 01-26-12, Effective: 02 -27-12) A. General Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. STIs remain an important cause of morbidity in the United States and have both health and economic consequences. Many of the complications of STIs are borne by women and children Often, STIs do not present any symptoms so can go untreated for long periods of time The presence of an STI during pregnancy may result in significant health complications for the woman and infant. In fact, any person who has an STI may develop health complications. Screening tests for the STIs in this national coverage determination (NCD) are laboratory tests. Under \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has the authority to add coverage of additional preventive services if certain statutory requirements are met. The regulations provide: \u00a7410.64 Additional preventive services (a) Medicare Part B pays for additional p reventive services not described in paragraph (1) or (3) of the definition of \"preventive services\" under \u00a7410.2, that identify medical conditions or risk factors for individuals if the Secretary determines through the national coverage determination process (as defined in section 1869(f)(1)(B) of the Act) that these services are all of the following: (1) reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability.(2) recommended with a grade of A or B by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, (3) appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B. (b) In making determinations under paragraph (a) of this section regarding the coverage of a new preventive service, the Secretary may conduct an assessment of the relation between predicted outcomes and the expenditures for such services and may take into account the results of such an assessment in making such national coverage determinations. The scope of the national coverage analysis for this NCD evaluated the evidence for the following STIs and high intensity behavioral counseling (HIBC) to prevent STIs for which the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has issued either an A or B recommendation: Screening for chlamy dial infection for all sexually active non- pregnant young women aged 24 and younger and for older non- pregnant women who are at increased risk, Screening for chlamydial infection for all pregnant women aged 24 and younger and for older pregnant women who are at increased risk, Screening for gonorrhea infection in all sexually active women, including those who are pregnant, if they are at increased risk, Screening for syphilis infection for all pregnant women and for all persons at increased risk, Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit, HIBC for the prevention of STIs for all sexually active adolescents, and for adults at increased risk for STIs. B. Nationally Covered Indications CMS has determi ned that the evidence is adequate to conclude that screening for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B, as well as HIBC to prevent STIs, consistent with the grade A and B recommendations by the USPSTF, is reasonable and necessary for the early de tection or prevention of an illness or disability and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B. Therefore, effective for claims with dates of services on or after November 8, 2011, CMS will cover screening for these USPSTF -indicated STIs with the appropriate Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved/cleared laboratory tests, used consistent with FDA -approved labeling, and in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) regulations, when ordered by the primary care physician or practitioner, and performed by an eligible Medicare provider for these services. Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea: Pregnant women who are 24 years old or younger when the diagnosis of pregnancy is known, and then repeat screening during the third trimester if high- risk sexual behavior has occurred since the initial screening test. Pregnant women who are at increased risk for STIs when the diagnosis of pregnancy is known, and then repeat screening during t he third trimester if high -risk sexual behavior has occurred since the initial screening test. Women at increased risk for STIs annually. Screening for syphilis: Pregnant women when the diagnosis of pregnancy is known, and then repeat screening during t he third trimester and at delivery if high -risk sexual behavior has occurred since the previous screening test. Men and women at increased risk for STIs annually. Screening for hepatitis B: Pregnant women at the first prenatal visit when the diagnosis of pregnancy is known, and then rescreening at time of delivery for those with new or continuing risk factors. In addition, effective for claims with dates of service on or after November 8, 2011, CMS will cover up to two individual 20- to 30- minute, face -to-face counseling sessions annually for Medicare beneficiaries for HIBC to prevent STIs, for all sexually active adolescents, and for adults at increased risk for STIs, if referred for this service by a primary care physician or practitioner, and provide d by a Medicare eligible primary care provider in a primary care setting. Coverage of HIBC to prevent STIs is consistent with the USPSTF recommendation. HIBC is defined as a program intended to promote sexual risk reduction or risk avoidance, which includes each of these broad topics, allowing flexibility for appropriate patient -focused elements: education, skills training, guidance on how to change sexual behavior. The high/increased risk individual sexual behaviors, based on the USPSTF guidelines, include any of the following: Multiple sex partners Using barrier protection inconsistently Having sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs Having sex in exchange for money or drugs Age (24 years of age or younger and sexually active for women for chlamydia and gonorrhea) Having an STI within the past year IV drug use (for hepatitis B only) In addition for men - men having sex with men (MSM) and engaged in high risk sexual behavior, but no regard to age In addition to individual risk factors, in concurrence with the USPSTF recommendations, community social factors such as high prevalence of STIs in the community populations should be considered in determining high/increased risk for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and for recommending HIBC. High/in creased risk sexual behavior for STIs is determined by the primary care provider by assessing the patient's sexual history which is part of any complete medical history, typically part of an annual wellness visit or prenatal visit and considered in the development of a comprehensive prevention plan. The medical record should be a reflection of the service provided. For the purposes of this NCD, a primary care setting is defined as the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians w ho are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgi cal centers, independent diagnostic testing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, clinics providing a limited focus of health care services, and hospice are examples of settings not considered primary care settings under this definition. For the purposes of this NCD, a \" primary care physician \" and \"primary care practitioner \" will be defined based on existing sections of the Social Security Act (\u00a71833(u)(6), \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i)(I) and \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i)(II)). \u00a71833(u) (6) Physician Defined. \u2014For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"physician\" means a physician described in section 1861(r)(1) and the term \"primary care physician\" means a physician who is identified in the available data as a general practitioner, family practice practitioner, general internist, or obstetrician or gynecologist. \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i) (I) is a physi cian (as described in section 1861(r)(1) ) who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine; or (II) is a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant (as those terms are defined in section 1861(aa)(5) ); C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications Unless specifically covered in this NCD, any other NCD, or in statute, preventive services are non-covered by Medicare. D. Other Medicare coinsurance and Part B deductible are waived for these preventive services. HIBC to prevent STIs may be provided on the same date of services as an annual wellness vi sit, evaluation and management (E&M) service, or during the global billing period for obstetrical car, but only one HIBC may be provided on any one date of service. See the claims processing manual for further instructions on claims processing. For servi ces provided on an annual basis, this is defined as a 12-month period. (This NCD last reviewed November 2011.) 210.11 - Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) (Effective November 8, 2011) (Rev. 137, Issued: 11- 23-11, Effective: 11 02-12 CWF/HICR/MCS MCDST) A. General Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. CVD, which is comprised of hypertension, coronary heart disease (such as myocardial infarction and angina pectoris), heart failure and stroke, is also the leading cause of hospitalizations. Although the overall adjusted mortality rate from heart disease has declined over the past decade, opportunities for improvement still exist. Risk factors for CVD include being overweight, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, family history of myocardial infarction, and older age. Under \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has the authority to add coverage of additional preventive services through the National Coverage Determination (NCD) process if certain statutory requirements a re met. Following its review, CMS has determined that the evidence is adequate to conclude that intensive behavioral therapy for CVD is reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability, is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B, and is comprised of components that are recommended with a grade of A or B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on or after November 8, 2011, CMS covers intensive behavioral therapy for CVD (referred to below as a CVD risk reduction visit), which consists of the following three components: encouraging aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD when the benefits outweigh the risks for men age 45- 79 years and women 55- 79 years; screening for high blood pressure in adults age 18 years and older; and intensive behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet for adults with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, advancing age, and other known risk factors for cardiovascular - and diet - related chronic disease. We note that only a small proportion (about 4%) of the Medicare population is under 45 years (men) or 55 years (women), therefore the vast majo rity of beneficiaries should receive all three components. Intensive behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet is broadly recommended to cover close to 100% of the population due to the prevalence of known risk factors. Therefore, CMS covers one, f ace-to-face CVD risk reduction visit per year for Medicare beneficiaries who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided, and whose counseling is furnished by a qualified primary care physician or other primary care practitioner in a pr imary care setting. The behavioral counseling intervention for aspirin use and healthy diet should be consistent with the Five As approach that has been adopted by the USPSTF to describe such services: Assess: Ask about/assess behavioral health risk(s) and factors affecting choice of behavior change goals/methods. Advise : Give clear, specific, and personalized behavior change advice, including information about personal health harms and benefits. Agree: Collaboratively select appropriate treatment go als and methods based on the patient's interest in and willingness to change the behavior. Assist : Using behavior change techniques (self -help and/or counseling), aid the patient in achieving agreed -upon goals by acquiring the skills, confidence, and soc ial/environmental supports for behavior change, supplemented with adjunctive medical treatments when appropriate. Arrange: Schedule follow -up contacts (in person or by telephone) to provide ongoing assistance/support and to adjust the treatment plan as n eeded, including referral to more intensive or specialized treatment. For the purpose of this NCD, a primary care setting is defined as the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large m ajority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and hospices are not considered primary care settings under this definition. For the purpose of this NCD, a \"primary care physician\" and \"primary care practitioner\" are defined consistent with existing sections of the Act (\u00a71833(u)(6), \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i)(I) and \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i)(II)). \u00a71833(u) (6) Physician Defined.\u2014 For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"physician\" means a physician described in section 1861(r)(1) and the term \"primary care physici an\" means a physician who is identified in the available data as a general practitioner, family practice practitioner, general internist, or obstetrician or gynecologist. \u00a71833(x)(2) (A) Primary care practitioner. \u2014The term \"primary care practitioner\" mean s an individual \u2014 (i) who \u2014 (I) is a physician (as described in section 1861(r)(1)) who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine; or (II) is a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse spe cialist, or physician assistant (as those terms are defined in section 1861(aa)(5)).

(This NCD last reviewed November 2011.) 210.12 - Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity (Effective November 29, 2011) (Rev. 142, issued: 02- 03-12, Effective: 11 -29-11, Implementation: upon authority to cover \"additional preventive services\" for Medicare beneficiaries if certain statutory requirements are met, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated a new national coverage analysis on intensive behavioral therapy for obesity. Screening for obesity in adults is recommended with a grade of B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A and Part B. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that \"obesity rates in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the last 30 years, and obesity is now epidemic in the United States.\" In the Medicare population over 30% of men and women are obese. Obesity is directly or indirectly associated with many chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal conditions and diabetes. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on or after November 29, 2011, CMS covers intensive behavioral therapy for obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability. Intensive behavioral therapy for obesity consists of the following: 1. Screening for obesity in a dults using measurement of BMI calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters (expressed kg/m2); 2. Dietary (nutritional) assessment; and 3. Intensive behavioral counseling and behavioral therapy to promote sustained weight loss through high intensity interventions on diet and exercise. The intensive behavioral intervention for obesity should be consistent with the 5- A framework that has been highlighted by the USPSTF: 1. Assess: Ask about/assess behavioral health risk(s) and factors affecting choice of behavior change goals/methods. 2. Advise : Give clear, specific, and personalized behavior change advice, including information about personal health harms and benefits. 3. Agree: Collaboratively select appropriate treatment goals and methods based on the patient's interest in and willingness to change the behavior. 4. Assist : Using behavior change techniques (self -help and/or counseling), aid the patient in achieving agreed -upon goals by acquiring the skills, confidence, and social /environmental supports for behavior change, supplemented with adjunctive medical treatments when appropriate. 5. Arrange: Schedule follow -up contacts (in person or by telephone) to provide ongoing assistance/support and to adjust the treatment plan as needed, including referral to more intensive or specialized treatment. For Medicare beneficiaries with obesity, who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided and whose counseling is furnished by a qualified primary care physician or other primary care practitioner and in a primary care setting, CMS covers: One face- to-face visit every week for the first month; One face- to-face visit every other week for months 2- 6; One face- to-face visit every month for months 7- 12, if the beneficiar y meets the 3kg weight loss requirement during the first six months as discussed below. At the six month visit, a reassessment of obesity and a determination of the amount of weight loss must be performed. To be eligible for additional face -to-face visit s occurring once a month for an additional six months, beneficiaries must have achieved a reduction in weight of at least 3kg over the course of the first six months of intensive therapy. This determination must be documented in the physician office recor ds for applicable beneficiaries consistent with usual practice. For beneficiaries who do not achieve a weight loss of at least 3kg during the first six months of intensive therapy, a reassessment of their readiness to change and BMI is appropriate after an additional six month period. For the purposes of this decision memorandum, a primary care setting is defined as one in which there is provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing fac ilities, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and hospices are not considered primary care settings under this definition. For the purposes of this decision memorandum a \"primary care physician\" and \"primary care practitioner\" will be defined consistent with existing sections of the Social Security Act (\u00a71833(u)(6), \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i)(I) and \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i)(II)). \u00a71833(u) (6) Physician Defined.\u2014For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"physician\" means a physician described in section 1861(r)(1) and the term \"primary care physician\" means a physician who is identified in the a vailable data as a general practitioner, family practice practitioner, general internist, or obstetrician or gynecologist. \u00a71833(x)(2)(A) Primary care practitioner \u2014The term \"primary care practitioner\" means an individual \u2014 (i) who \u2014 (I) is a physician (as d escribed in section 1861(r)(1)) who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine; or (II) is a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant (as those terms are defined in section 1861(aa)(5)) C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications All other indications remain non-covered. D. Other Medicare coinsurance and Part B deductible are waived for this service (This NCD last reviewed November 2011) 210.13 - Screening for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in Adults (Rev. 177, Issued: 11-19-14, Effective: analysis; 04-06-15 - For remaining shared systems edits ) A. General Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a n infection that attacks the liver and leads to inflammation. The infection is often asymptomatic and can go undiagnosed for decades. It is difficult for the human immune system to eliminate the HCV and it is a major cause of chronic liver disease. The presence of HCV in the liver initiates a response from the immune system which in turn causes inflammation. Inflammation over long periods of time (usually decades) can cause scarring, called cirrhosis. A cirrhotic liver fails to perform the normal functions of the liver which leads to liver failure. Cirrhotic livers are more prone to become cancerous and liver failure leads to serious complications, even death. HCV is reported to be the leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer and a primary indication for liver transplant in the Western World. Under \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has the authority to add coverage of additional preventive services if certain statu tory requirements are met. The regulations provide: 42 CFR \u00a7410.64 Additional preventive services (a) Medicare Part B pays for additional preventive services not described in paragraph (1) or (3) of the definition of \"preventive services\" under 42 CFR \u00a7410.2, that identify medical conditions or risk factors for individuals if the Secretary determines through the national coverage determination process (as defined in section 1869(f)(1)(B) of the Act) that these services are all of the following: (1) reason able and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability,(2) recommended with a grade of A or B by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), (3) appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B. (b) In making determinations under paragraph (a) of this section regarding the coverage of a new preventive service, the Secretary may conduct an assessment of the relation between predicted outcomes and the expenditures for such servic es and may take into account the results of such an assessment in making such national coverage determinations. The scope of the review for this national coverage determination (NCD) evaluated and determined if the existing body of evidence was sufficient for Medicare coverage for screening for HCV in adults at high risk for HCV infection and one -time screening for HCV infection for adults born between 1945 and 1965, which is recommended with a grade B by the USPSTF. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for services performed on or after June 2, 2014, CMS has determined the following: The evidence is adequate to conclude that screening for HCV, consistent with the grade B recommendations by the USPSTF, is reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of an illness or disability and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B, as described below. Therefore, CMS will cover screening for HCV with the appropriate U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved/cleared laboratory tests, used consistent with FDA -approved labeling and in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act regulations, when ordered by the beneficiary's primary care physician or practitioner within the context of a primary care setting, and performed by an eligible Medicare provider for these services, for beneficiaries who meet either of the following conditions: 1. A screening test is covered for adults at high risk for HCV infection. \"High ris k\" is defined as persons with a current or past history of illicit injection drug use; and persons who have a history of receiving a blood transfusion prior to 1992. Repeat screening for high risk persons is covered annually only for persons who have had continued illicit injection drug use since the prior negative screening test. 2. A single screening test is covered for adults who do not meet the high risk definition above, but who were born from 1945 through 1965. The determination of \"high risk for HCV\" is identified by the primary care physician or practitioner who assesses the patient's history, which is part of any complete medical history, typically part of an annual wellness visit and considered in the development of a comprehensive prevention plan. The medical record should be a reflection of the service provided. A primary care setting is defined by the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing facilities, skilled nursi ng facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, clinics providing a limited focus of health care services, and hospice are examples of settings not considered primary care settings under this definition. A \"primary care physician\" and \"primary care pr actitioner\" will be defined consistent with existing sections of the Act (\u00a71833(u)(6), \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i)(I) and \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i)(II)). \u00a71833(u) (6) Physician Defined.\u2014 For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"physician\" means a physician described in s ection 1861(r)(1) and the term \"primary care physician\" means a physician who is identified in the available data as a general practitioner, family practice practitioner, general internist, or obstetrician or gynecologist. \u00a71833(x)(2)(A)(i) (I) is a phys ician (as described in section 1861(r)(1)) who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine; or (II) is a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant (as tho se terms are defined in section 1861(aa)(5)). C. Nationally Non- Covered Indications Unless specifically covered in this NCD, any other NCD, or in statute, preventive services are non-covered by Medicare. D. Other N/A (This NCD last reviewed June 2014.) 210.14 - Lung Cancer Screening with Low Dose A. General Lung cancer is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Cancer of the lung and bronchus accounted for over 130,000 deaths in 2021 (more than the total number of estimated deaths from colon, breast and prostate cancer combined) with a median age at death of 72 years. Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging procedure that uses specialized x -ray equipment to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body. Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) is a chest CT scan performed at settings to minimize radiation exposure compared to a standard chest CT. Under \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services(CMS) has the authority to add coverage of \"additional preventive services\" through the Medicare national coverage determination (NCD) process if certain statutory requirements are met: (1) reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability, (2) recommended with a grade of A or B by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and (3) appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on or after February 10, 2022, CMS has determined that the evidence is sufficient to cover, under Medica re Part B, a lung cancer screening counseling and shared decision-making visit, and for appropriate beneficiaries, annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT, as an additional preventive service benefit under the Medicare program, only if all of the follow ing eligibility criteria are met. Beneficiary Eligibility Criteria Beneficiaries must meet all of the following eligibility criteria: Age 50 - 77 years; Asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of lung cancer); Tobacco smoking history of at least 20 pack- years (one pack -year = smoking one pack per day for one year; 1 pack =20 cigarettes); Current smoker or one who has quit smoking within the last 15 years; and, Receive an order for lung cancer screening with LDCT. Counseling and Shared Decision -Making Visit Before the beneficiary's first lung cancer LDCT screening, the beneficiary must receive a counseling and shared decision- making visit that meets all of the following criteria, and is appropriately documented in the beneficiary's medi cal records: Determination of beneficiary eligibility; Shared decision -making, including the use of one or more decision aids; Counseling on the importance of adherence to annual lung cancer LDCT screening, impact of comorbidities and ability or willingne ss to undergo diagnosis and treatment; and, Counseling on the importance of maintaining cigarette smoking abstinence if former smoker; or the importance of smoking cessation if current smoker and, if appropriate, furnishing of information about tobacco cessation interventions. Reading Radiologist Eligibility Criteria The reading radiologist must have board certification or board eligibility with the American Board of Radiology or equivalent organization. Radiology Imaging Facility Eligibility Criteria Lung cancer screening with LDCT must be furnished in a radiology imaging facility that utilizes a standardized lung nodule identification, classification, and reporting system. C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications Preventive services are non -covered by Medicare unless specifically covered in this NCD, any other NCD, or in statute or regulations. D. Other Medicare Part B coinsurance and deductible are waived for this preventive service. (This NCD last reviewed February 2022.) 220 - Radiology ICD -10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) A. General Diagnostic examinations of the head (head scans) and of other parts of the body (body scans) performed by computerized tomography (CT) scanners are covered if medical and scientific literature and opinion support the effective use of a scan for the condition, and the scan is: (1) reasonable and necessary for the indi vidual patient; and (2) performed on a model of CT equipment that meets the criteria in C below. The CT scans have become the primary diagnostic tool for many conditions and symptoms. CT scanning used as the primary diagnostic tool can be cost effective because it can eliminate the need for a series of other tests, is noninvasive and thus virtually eliminates complications, and does not require hospitalization. B. Determining Whether a CT Scan Is Reasonable and Necessary Sufficient information must be p rovided with claims to differentiate CT scans from other radiology services and to make coverage determinations. Carefully review claims to ensure that a scan is reasonable and necessary for the individual patient; i.e., the use must be found to be medically appropriate considering the patient's symptoms and preliminary diagnosis. There is no general rule that requires other diagnostic tests to be tried before CT scanning is used. However, in an individual case the A/B MAC (A) or (B) medical staff may de termine that use of a CT scan as the initial diagnostic test was not reasonable and necessary because it was not supported by the patient's symptoms or complaints stated on the claim form; e.g., \"periodic headaches.\" Claims for CT scans are reviewed for evidence of abuse, which might include the absence of reasonable indications for the scans, an excessive number of scans, or unnecessarily expensive types of scans considering the facts in the particular cases. C. Approved Models of CT Equipment 1. Criteria for Approval In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the A/B MAC (A) or (B) may assume that a CT scan for which payment is requested has been performed on equipment that meets the following criteria: a. The model must be known to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and b. Must be in the full market release phase of development. Should it be necessary to confirm that those criteria are met, ask the manufacturer to submit the information in C.2. If manufacturers inquire about obtaining M edicare approval for their equipment, inform them of the foregoing criteria. 2. Evidence of Approval a. The letter sent by the Bureau of Radiological Health, FDA, to the manufacturer acknowledging the FDA's receipt of information on the specific CT scanner system model submitted as required under Public Law 90- 602, \"The Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968.\" b. A letter signed by the chief executive officer or other officer acting in a similar capacity for the manufacturer which: i.. Furn ishes the CT scanner system model number, all names that hospitals and physicians' offices may use to refer to the CT scanner system on claims, and the accession number assigned by FDA to the specific model; ii. Specifies whether the scanner performs head scans only, body scans only (i.e., scans of parts of the body other than the head), or head and body scans; iii. States that the company or corporation is satisfied with the results of the developmental stages t hat preceded the full market release phase of the equipment, that the equipment is in the full market release phase, and the date on which it was decided to put the product into the full market release phase. D. Mobile CT Equipment CT scans performed on mobile units are subject to the same Medicare coverage requirements applicable to scans performed on stationary units, as well as certain health and safety requirements recommended by the Health Resources and Services Administration. As with scans perform ed on stationary units, the scans must be determined medically necessary for the individual patient. The scans must be performed on types of CT scanning equipment that have been approved for use as stationary units (see C above), and must be in compliance with applicable State laws and regulations for control of radiation. 1. Hospital Setting The hospital must assume responsibility for the quality of the scan furnished to inpatients and outpatients and must ensure that a radiologist or other qualified physician is in charge of the procedure. The radiologist or other physician (i.e., one who is with the mobile unit) who is responsible for the procedure must be approved by the hospital for similar privileges. 2. Ambulatory Setting If mobile CT scan servi ces are furnished at an ambulatory health care facility other than a hospital -based facility, e.g., a freestanding physician- directed clinic, the diagnostic procedure must be performed by, or under the direct personal supervision of, a radiologist or other qualified physician. In addition, the facility must maintain a record of the attending physician's order for a scan performed on a mobile unit. 3. Billing for Mobile CT Scans Hospitals, hospital- associated radiologists, ambulatory health care facilitie s, and physician owner/operators of mobile units may bill for mobile scans as they would for scans performed on stationary equipment. 4. Claims Review Evidence of compliance with applicable State laws and regulations for control of radiation should be requested from owners of mobile CT scan units upon receipt of the first claims. All mobile scan claims should be reviewed very carefully in accordance with instructions applicable to scans performed on fixed units, with particular emphasis on the medical necessity for scans performed in an ambulatory setting. E. Multi -Planar Diagnostic Imaging (MPDI) In usual CT scanning procedures, a series of transverse or axial images are reproduced. These transverse images are routinely translated into coronal and/o r sagittal views. MPDI is a process which further translates the data produced by CT scanning by providing reconstructed oblique images which can contribute to diagnostic information. MPDI, also known as planar image reconstruction or reformatted imaging, is covered under Medicare when provided as a service to an entity performing a covered CT scan. F. Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) CTA is a general phrase used to describe a non -invasive method, using intravenous contrast, to visualize the coronary arteries (or other vessels) using high-resolution, high- speed CT. After examining the medical evidence, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has determined that no national coverage determination is appropriate at this time (March 12, 2008). Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act decisions should be made by MACs through a local coverage determination process or case-by- case adjudication. See Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 617 (1984) (Recognizing that the Secretary has discretion to either establish a generally applicable rule or to allow individual adjudication.). See also, 68 Fed. Reg. 63692, 63693 (November 7, 2003). 220.2 - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Various Effective Dates Below) (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04- 14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD -10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) A. General 1. Method of Operation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), formerly called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), is a non-invasive method of graphically r epresenting the distribution of water and other hydrogen - rich molecules in the human body. In contrast to conventional radiographs or computed tomography (CT) scans, in which the image is produced by x- ray beam attenuation by an object, MRI is capable of producing images by several techniques. In fact, various combinations of MRI image production methods may be employed to emphasize particular characteristics of the tissue or body part being examined. The basic elements by which MRI produces an image are the density of hydrogen nuclei in the object being examined, their motion, and the relaxation times, and the period of time required for the nuclei to return to their original states in the main, static magnetic field after being subjected to a brief addi tional magnetic field. These relaxation times reflect the physical- chemical properties of tissue and the molecular environment of its hydrogen nuclei. Only hydrogen atoms are present in human tissues in sufficient concentration for current use in clinica l MRI. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is a non- invasive diagnostic test that is an application of MRI. By analyzing the amount of energy released from tissues exposed to a strong magnetic field, MRA provides images of normal and diseased blood vesse ls, as well as visualization and quantification of blood flow through these vessels. 2. General Clinical Utility Overall, MRI is a useful diagnostic imaging modality that is capable of demonstrating a wide variety of soft -tissue lesions with contrast resolution equal or superior to CT scanning in various parts of the body. Among the advantages of MRI are the absence of ionizing radiation and the ability to achieve high levels of tissue contrast resolution without injected iodinated radiological contrast agents. Recent advances in technology have resulted in development and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of new paramagnetic contrast agents for MRI which allow even better visualization in some instances. Multi- slice imaging and the ability to image in multiple planes, especially sagittal and coronal, have provided flexibility not easily available with other modalities. Because cortical (outer layer) bone and metallic prostheses do not cause distortion of MR images, it has been possible to visualize certain lesions and body regions with greater certainty than has been possible with CT. The use of MRI on certain soft tissue structures for the purpose of detecting disruptive, neoplastic, de generative, or inflammatory lesions has now become established in medical practice. Phase contrast (PC) and time- of-flight (TOF) are some of the available MRA techniques at the time these instructions are being issued. PC measures the difference between the phases of proton spins in tissue and blood and measures both the venous and arterial blood flow at any point in the cardiac cycle. TOF measures the difference between the amount of magnetization of tissue and blood and provides information on the structure of blood vessels, thus indirectly indicating blood flow. Two -dimensional (2D) and three -dimensional (3D) images can be obtained using each method. Contrast -enhanced MRA (CE -MRA) involves blood flow imaging after the patient receives an intravenous injection of a contrast agent. Gadolinium, a non- ionic element, is the foundation of all contrast agents currently in use. Gadolinium affects the way in which tissues respond to magnetization, resulting in better visualization of structures when compared to un- enhanced studies. Unlike ionic (i.e., iodine -based) contrast agents used in conventional contrast angiography (CA), allergic reactions to gadolinium are extremely rare. Additionally, gadolinium does not cause the kidney failure occasionally seen with ionic contrast agents. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is a computer -augmented form of CA that obtains digital blood flow images as contrast agent courses through a blood vessel. The computer \"subtracts\" bone and other tissue from the image, thereby improving visualization of blood vessels. Physicians elect to use a specific MRA or CA technique based upon clinical information from each patient. B. Nationally Covered MRI and MRA Indications 1. MRI Although several uses of MRI are still considered investigational and some uses are clearly contraindicated (see subsection C), MRI is considered medically efficacious for a number of uses. Use the following descriptions as general guidelines or examples of what may be considered covered rather than as a restrictive list of specific covered indications. Coverage is limited to MRI units that have received FDA premarket approval, and such units must be operated within the parameters specified by the approval. In addition, the services must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the specific patient involved. a. Effective November 22, 1985, MRI is useful in examining the head, central nervous system, and spine. Multiple sclerosis can be diagnosed with MRI and the contents of the posterior fossa are visible. The inherent tissue contrast resolution of MRI makes it an appropriate standard diagnostic modality for general neuroradiology. b. Effective Nov ember 22, 1985, MRI can assist in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal and retroperitoneal masses, including abnormalities of the large vessels such as aneurysms and dissection. When a clinical need exists to visualize the parenchyma of solid organs to detect anatomic disruption or neoplasia, this can be accomplished in the liver, urogenital system, adrenals, and pelvic organs without the use of radiological contrast materials. When MRI is considered reasonable and necessary, the use of paramagnetic contrast materials may be covered as part of the study. MRI may also be used to detect and stage pelvic and retroperitoneal neoplasms and to evaluate disorders of cancellous bone and soft tissues. It may also be used in the detection of pericardial thick ening. Primary and secondary bone neoplasm and aseptic necrosis can be detected at an early stage and monitored with MRI. Patients with metallic prostheses, especially of the hip, can be imaged in order to detect the early stages of infection of the bone to which the prosthesis is attached. c. Effective March 22, 1994, MRI may also be covered to diagnose disc disease without regard to whether radiological imaging has been tried first to diagnose the problem. d. Effective March 4, 1991, MRI with gating devices and surface coils, and gating devices that eliminate distorted images caused by cardiac and respiratory movement cycles are now considered state of the art techniques and may be covered. Surface and other specialty coils may also be covered, as they are used routinely for high resolution imaging where small limited regions of the body are studied. They produce high signal - to-noise ratios resulting in images of enhanced anatomic detail. 2. MRA (MRI for Blood Flow) Currently covered indications inc lude using MRA for specific conditions to evaluate flow in internal carotid vessels of the head and neck, peripheral arteries of lower extremities, abdomen and pelvis, and the chest. Coverage is limited to MRA units that have received FDA premarket approval, and such units must be operated within the parameters specified by the approval. In addition, the services must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the specific patient involved. a. Head and Neck Effective April 15, 2003, studies have proven that MRA is effective for evaluating flow in internal carotid vessels of the head and neck. However, not all potential applications of MRA have been shown to be reasonable and necessary. All of the following criteria must apply in order for Medicare to provide coverage for MRA of the head and neck: MRA is used to evaluate the carotid arteries, the circle of Willis, the anterior, middle or posterior cerebral arteries, the vertebral or basilar arteries or the v enous sinuses; MRA is performed on patients with conditions of the head and neck for which surgery is anticipated and may be found to be appropriate based on the MRA. These conditions include, but are not limited to, tumor, aneurysms, vascular malformations, vascular occlusion or thrombosis. Within this broad category of disorders, medical necessity is the underlying determinant of the need for an MRA in specific diseases. The medical records should clearly justify and demonstrate the existence of medical necessity; and MRA and CA are not expected to be performed on the same patient for diagnostic purposes prior to the application of anticipated therapy. Only one of these tests will be covered routinely unless the physician can demonstrate the medical need to perform both tests. b. Peripheral Arteries of Lower Extremities Effective April 15, 2003, studies have proven that MRA of peripheral arteries is useful in determining the presence and extent of peripheral vascular disease in lower extremities. T his procedure is non- invasive and has been shown to find occult vessels in some patients for which those vessels were not apparent when CA was performed. Medicare will cover either MRA or CA to evaluate peripheral arteries of the lower extremities. Howev er, both MRA and CA may be useful in some cases, such as: A patient has had CA and this test was unable to identify a viable run -off vessel for bypass. When exploratory surgery is not believed to be a reasonable medical course of action for this patient , MRA may be performed to identify the viable runoff vessel; or A patient has had MRA, but the results are inconclusive. c. Abdomen and Pelvis i. Pre -operative Evaluation of Patients Undergoing Elective Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Repair Effective July 1, 1999, MRA is covered for pre -operative evaluation of patients undergoing elective AAA repair if the scientific evidence reveals MRA is considered comparable to CA in determining the extent of AAA, as well as in evaluating aortoiliac occlu sion disease and renal artery pathology that may be necessary in the surgical planning of AAA repair. These studies also reveal that MRA could provide a net benefit to the patient. If preoperative CA is avoided, then patients are not exposed to the risks associated with invasive procedures, contrast media, end- organ damage, or arterial injury. ii. Imaging the Renal Arteries and the Aortoiliac Arteries in the Absence of AAA or Aortic Dissection Effective July 1, 2003, MRA coverage is expanded to include imaging the renal arteries and the aortoiliac arteries in the absence of AAA or aortic dissection. MRA should be obtained in those circumstances in which using MRA is expected to avoid obtaining CA, when physician history, physical examination, and standard assessment tools provide insufficient information for patient management, and obtaining an MRA has a high probability of positively affecting patient management. However, CA may be ordered after obtaining the results of an MRA in those rare instances where medical necessity is demonstrated. d. Chest i. Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism Current scientific data has shown that diagnostic pulmonary MRAs are improving due to recent developments such as faster imaging capabilities and gadolinium - enhancemen t. However, these advances in MRA are not significant enough to warrant replacement of pulmonary angiography in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism for patients who have no contraindication to receiving intravenous iodinated contrast material. Patients w ho are allergic to iodinated contrast material face a high risk of developing complications if they undergo pulmonary angiography or computed tomography angiography. Therefore, Medicare will cover MRA of the chest for diagnosing a suspected pulmonary embolism when it is contraindicated for the patient to receive intravascular iodinated contrast material. ii. Evaluation of Thoracic Aortic Dissection and Aneurysm Studies have shown that MRA of the chest has a high level of diagnostic accuracy for pre-operative and post -operative evaluation of aortic dissection of aneurysm. Depending on the clinical presentation, MRA may be used as an alternative to other non- invasive imaging technologies, such as transesophageal echocardiography and CT. Generally, Medicare will provide coverage only for MRA or for CA when used as a diagnostic test. However, if both MRA and CA of the chest are used, the physician must demonstrate the medical need for performing these tests. While the intent of this policy is to provide reimbursement for either RA or CA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is also allowing flexibility for physicians to make appropriate decisions concerning the use of these tests based on the needs of individual patients. CMS anticipates, however, low utilization of the combined use of MRA and CA. As a result, CMS encourages the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) to monitor the use of these tests and, where indicated, require evidence of the need to perform both MRA and CA. C. Contraindications and Nationally Non -Covered Indications 1. Contraindications The MRI is not covered when the following patient -specific contraindications are present: MRI is not covered for patients with cardiac pacemakers or with metallic clips on vascular aneurysms unless the Medicare beneficiary meets the provisions of the following exceptions: Effective July 7, 2011, the contraindications will not apply to pacemakers when used according to the FDA -approved labeling in an MRI environment, or Effective February 24, 2011, CMS believes that the evidence is promising although not yet convincing that MRI will improve patient health outcomes if certain safeguards are in place to ensure that the exposure of t he device to an MRI environment adversely affects neither the interpretation of the MRI result nor the proper functioning of the implanted device itself. We believe that specific precautions (as listed below) could maximize benefits of MRI exposure for beneficiaries enrolled in clinical trials designed to assess the utility and safety of MRI exposure. Therefore, CMS determines that MRI will be covered by Medicare when provided in a clinical study under section 1862(a)(1)(E) (consistent with section 1142 of the Social Security Act (the Act)) through the Coverage with Study Participation (CSP) form of Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) if the study meets the criteria in each of the three paragraphs below: The approved prospective clinical study of MRI must, with appropriate methodology, address one or more aspects of the following questions: 1. Do results of MRI in implanted permanent pacemaker (PM)/implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) beneficiaries with implanted cardiac devices affect physician decision making related to: a. Clinical management strategy (e.g., in oncology, toward palliative or curative care)? b. Planning of treatment interventions?; or c. Prevention of unneeded diagnostic studies or interventions, or preventable exposures? 2. Do results of MRI in PM/ICD beneficiaries with implanted cardiac devices affect patient outcomes related to: a. Survival? b. Quality of life?; or c. Adverse events during and after MR scanning? In addition, the prospective clinical study of MRI must include safety criteria for all participants. Such required safety measures for such studies, as further explained in guidance documents from professional societies must include, but are not limited to: 1. MRI should be done on a case -by-case and site- by-site basis. 2. MRI scan sequences, field intensity, and field(s) of exposure should be selected to minimize risk to the patient while gaining needed diagnostic information for diagnosis or for managing therapy. 3. MRI scanning should be done only if the site is staffed with individuals with the appropriate radiology and cardiology knowledge and expertise on hand. 4. Implanted device patients who are candidates for recruitment for an MRI clinical study should be advised that life -threatening arrhythmias might occur during MRI and serious device malfunction might occur, requiring replacement of the device. 5. Radiology and cardiology personnel and a fully stocked crash cart should be readily available throughout the procedure in case a significant arrhythmia develops during the examination that does not terminate with the cessation of the MRI study. The cardiologist should be familiar with the patient's arrhythmia history and the implanted device. A programmer that can be used to adjust the device as necessary should be readily avail able. 6. All such patients should be actively monitored for cardiac and respiratory function throughout the examination. At a minimum, ECG and pulse oximetry should be used. Visual and verbal contact with the patient must be maintained throughout the MRI sc an. The patient should be instructed to alert the MRI staff on hand to any unusual sensations, pains, or to any problems. 7. At the conclusion of the examination, the cardiologist should examine the device to confirm that the function is consistent with its pre-examination state. 8. Follow- up should include a check of the patient's device at a time remote (1 -6 weeks) after the scan to confirm appropriate function. 9. If the implanted device manufacturer has indicated additional safety precautions appropriate for safe MRI performance, these must be included in the study protocol. The clinical study must adhere to the following standards of scientific integrity and relevance to the Medicare population: a. The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a particular intervention potentially improves the participants' health outcomes. b. The research study is well supported by available scientific and medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use. c. The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing studies. d. The research study design is appropriate to answer the research question being asked in the study. e. The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of executing the proposed study successfully. f. The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the FDA, it must be in compliance with 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56. g. All aspects of the research study are conducted according to appropriate standards of scientific integrity (see http://www.icmje.org ). h. The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or incorporates by reference, the standards listed here as Medicare requirements for CED coverage. i. The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disea se pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR \u00a7312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options. j. The clinical research study is registered on the www.ClinicalTrials.gov website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject. k. The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all pre-specified outcomes to be measured, including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 24 months of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to be published in a peer reviewed journal, then that initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ( http://www.icmje.org ). However, a full report of the outcomes must be made public no later than three (3) years after the end of data collection. l. The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations in the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are necessary. m. The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability, or Medicaid eligibility. Consistent with section 1142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality supports clinical research studies that CMS determines meet the above -listed standards and address the above- listed research questions. MRI during a viable pregnancy is also contraindicated at this time. The danger inherent in bringing ferromagnetic materials within range of MRI units generally constrains the use of MRI on acutely ill patients requiring life support systems and monitoring devices that employ ferromagnetic materials. In addition, the long imaging time and the enclosed position of the patient may result in claustrop hobia, making patients who have a history of claustrophobia unsuitable candidates for MRI procedures. 2. Nationally Non-Covered Indications CMS has determined that MRI of cortical bone and calcifications, and procedures involving spatial resolution of bone and calcifications, are not considered reasonable and necessary indications within the meaning of section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act, and are therefore non-covered. D. Other Effective June 3, 2010, all other uses of MRI or MRA for which CMS has not specifically indicated coverage or non-coverage continue to be eligible for coverage through individual MAC discretion. 220.2.1 - Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Effective January 1, 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services determined that no national coverage determination (NCD) is appropriate at this time for Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. In the absence of an NCD, coverage determinations will be made by the Medicare Administrative Contractors under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act. 220.3 - Magnetic Resonance 220.3 has been removed from the NCD Manual and merged with section 220.2 effective June 3, 2010. 220.4 - Mammograms (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 50 -21 A diagnostic mammography is a radiologic procedure furnished to a man or woman with signs and symptoms of breast disease, or a personal history of breast cancer, or a personal history of biopsy - proven benign breast disease, and includes a physician's interpretation of the results of the procedure. A diagnostic mammography is a covered service if it is ordered by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy as defined in \u00a71861 (r) (1) of the Act. A screening mammography is a radiologic procedure furnished to a woman without signs or symptoms of breast disease, for the purpose of early detection of breast cancer, and includes a physician's interpretation of the results of the procedure. A screening mammography has limitations as it must be, at a minimum a two -view exposure (cranio- caudal and a medial lateral oblique view) of each breast. Payment may not be made for a screening mammography performed on a woman under age 35. Payment may be made for only one screening mammography performed on a woman over age 34, but under age 40. For an asymptomatic woman over age 39, payment may be made for a screening mammography performed after at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last screening mammography was performed. A radiological mammogram is a covered diagnostic test under the following conditions: A patient has distinct signs and symptoms for which a mammogram is indicated; A patient has a history of breast c ancer; or A patient is asymptomatic but, on the basis of the patient's history and other factors the physician considers significant, the physician's judgment is that a mammogram is appropriate. Use of mammograms in routine screening of: (1) asymptomatic women aged 50 and over, and (2) asymptomatic women aged 40 or over whose mothers or sisters have had the disease, is considered medically appropriate, but would not be covered for Medicare purposes.

The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 1, \"Inpatient Hospital Services,\" \u00a750 220.5 - Ultrasound Diagnostic Procedures (Effective 22, (Rev. 173, Issued: 09- 04-14, Effec tive: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) A. General Ultrasound diagnostic procedures utilizing low energy sound waves are being widely employed to determine the composition and contours of nearly all body tissues except bone and air -filled spaces. This technique permits noninvasive visualization of even the deepest structures in the body. The use of the ultrasound technique is sufficiently developed that it can be considered essential to good patient care in diagnosing a wide variety of conditions. Ultrasound diagnostic procedures are listed below and are divided into two categories. Medicare coverage is extended to the procedures listed in Category I. Periodic claims review by A/B MAC (A) medical consul tants should be conducted to ensure that the techniques are medically appropriate and the general indications specified in these categories are met. Techniques in Category II are considered experimental and should not be covered at this time. B. National ly Covered Indications Category I - (Clinically effective, usually part of initial patient evaluation, may be an adjunct to radiologic and nuclear medicine diagnostic technique) Echoencephalography, and Orbital Echography (A -Mode) Covered procedures include efforts to determine the suitability of aphakic patients for implantation of an artificial lens (pseudophakoi) following cataract surgery. Ocular and (M -Mode) Effusion Echography Thoracentesis, by Ultrasonic Guidance Abdominal Sonography, complete survey study (B -Scan) Abdominal Sonography, limited (e.g., follow -up or limited study) (B -Scan) Abdominal Sonography is not s ynonymous with ultrasound examination of individual organs. Renal Cyst Aspiration, by Ultrasonic Guidance Renal Biopsy, by Ultrasonic Guidance Pancreas Sonography (B -Scan) Pancreatic Sonography has proven effective in -Scan) Sonography not include planning of fields for radiation therapy. Urinary Bladder Sonography (B -Scan) Urinary bladder Sonography does not include staging of bladder tumors. Pregnancy Diagnosis Sonography (B -Scan) Fetal Age Determination (Biparietal Diameter) Sonography (B Fetal Rate Sonography (B -Scan) Pregnancy Pregnancy Sonography (B -Scan) Ectopic Pregnancy Diagnosis Sonography (B -Scan) Passive Testing (Antepartum Monitoring of Fetal Heart Rate In the Resting Fetus) Intrauterine Contraceptive Device Sonogr aphy (B -Scan) Pelvic Mass Diagnosis Sonography (B -Scan) by Ultrasonic Guidance Arterial Flow (Doppler) Flow Study, Peripheral (Doppler) Arterial Aneurysm, Peripheral Therapy Echography Monitoring of cardiac output (Esophageal Doppler) for ventilated patients in the ICU and operative patients with a need for intra -operative fluid optimization C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications Category II - (Clinical reliability and efficacy not proven) B-Scan for atherosclerotic narrowing of peripheral arteries. D. Other Uses for ultrasound diagnostic procedures not listed in Category I or II above are left to local MAC discretion. In view of the rapid changes in the field of ultrasound diagnosis, uses for ultrasound diagnostic procedures other than those listed under Categories I and II should be carefully reviewed before payment. Medical justification may be required. Cross reference: \u00a720.17 220.6 - Positron 1, 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services removed the umbrella national coverage determination (NCD) for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scans. In the absence of an NCD, coverage determinations for all oncologic and non-oncologic uses of PET that are not included in another NCD under section 220.6 will be made by the Medicare Administrative Contractors under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of t he Social Security Act. All PET indications currently covered or non- covered under NCDs under section 220.6 remain unchanged and MACs shall not alter coverage for indications covered under NCDs. 220.6.1 - PET for Perfusion of the Heart (Various Effective Dates) (Rev. 120; Issued: 06-10; 30-09) 1. Rubidium 82 (Effective March 14, 1995) Effective for services performed on or after March 14, 1995, PET scans performed at rest or with pharmacological stress used for noninvasive imaging of the perfusion of the heart for the diagnosis and management of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease using the FDA -approved radiopharmaceutical Rubidium 82 (Rb 82) are covered, provided the requirements below are met: o The PET scan, whether at rest alone, or rest with stress, is performed in place of, but not in addition to, a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); or o The PET scan, whether at rest alone or rest with stress, is used following a SPECT that was found to be inconclusive. In these cases, the PET scan must have been considered necessary in order to determine what me dical or surgical intervention is required to treat the patient. (For purposes of this requirement, an inconclusive test is a test(s) whose results are equivocal, technically uninterpretable, or discordant with a patient's other clinical data and must be documented in the beneficiary's file.) o For any PET scan for which Medicare payment is claimed for dates of services prior to July 1, 2001, the claimant must submit additional specified information on the claim form (including proper codes and/or modifiers) , to indicate the results of the PET scan. The claimant must also include information on whether the PET scan was performed after an inconclusive non- invasive cardiac test. The information submitted with respect to the previous noninvasive cardiac test must specify the type of test performed prior to the PET scan and whether it was inconclusive or unsatisfactory. These explanations are in the form of special G codes used for billing PET scans using Rb 82. Beginning July 1, 2001, claims should be submitted w ith the appropriate codes. 2. Ammonia N -13 (Effective October 1, 2003) Effective for services performed on or after October 1, 2003, PET scans performed at rest or with pharmacological stress used for noninvasive imaging of the perfusion of the heart for the diagnosis and management of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease using the FDA -approved radiopharmaceutical ammonia N -13 are covered, provided the requirements below are met: o The PET scan, whether at rest alone, or rest w ith stress, is performed in place of, but not in addition to, a SPECT; or o The PET scan, whether at rest alone or rest with stress, is used following a SPECT that was found to be inconclusive. In these cases, the PET scan must have been considered necessar y in order to determine what medical or surgical intervention is required to treat the patient. (For purposes of this requirement, an inconclusive test is a test whose results are equivocal, technically uninterpretable, or discordant with a patient's other clinical data and must be documented in the beneficiary's file.) (This NCD last reviewed March 2005.) 220.6.2 - FDG PET for Lung Cancer 220.6.2 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.3 - FDG PET for Esophageal Cancer 220.6.3 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.4 - FDG PET 220.6.4 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.5- FDG 220.6.5 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.6- FDG 220.6.6 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.7- FDG PET for Head and Neck Cancers 03- 220.6.7 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.8 - FDG PET for Myocardial Viability (Various Effective Dates Effective: 01 -28-05; Implementation: 04- 18-05) The identification of patients with partial loss of heart muscle movement or hibernating myocardium is import ant in selecting candidates with compromised ventricular function to determine appropriateness for revascularization. Diagnostic tests such as FDG PET distinguish between dysfunctional but viable myocardial tissue and scar tissue in order to affect manage ment decisions in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction. 1. FDG PET is covered for the determination of myocardial viability following an inconclusive single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) test from July 1, 2001, through September 30, 2002. Only full ring PET scanners are covered from July 1, 2001, through December 31, 2001. However, as of January 1, 2002, full and partial ring scanners are covered. 2. Beginning October 1, 2002, Medicare covers FDG PET for the determination of myocardial viability as a primary or initial diagnostic study prior to revascularization, or following an inconclusive SPECT. Studies performed by full and partial ring scanners are covered. Limitations: In the event a patient rece ives a SPECT test with inconclusive results, a PET scan may be covered. However, if a patient receives a FDG PET study with inconclusive results, a follow up SPECT test is not covered. Documentation that these conditions are met should be maintained by t he referring physician in the beneficiary's medical record, as is normal business practice. (See \u00a7220.12 for SPECT coverage.) (This NCD last reviewed September 2002.) 220.6.9 - FDG PET for Refractory Seizures (Effective July 1, (Rev. Issued: Effective Date: 04 -03-09; Implementation 30-09) Beginning July 1, 2001, Medicare covers FDG PET for pre -surgical evaluation for the purpose of localization of a focus of refractory seizure activity. Limitations: Covered only for pre -surgical evaluation. Documentation that these conditions are met should be maintained by the referring physician in the beneficiary's medical record, as is normal business practice. (This NCD last reviewed June 2001.) 220.6.10- FDG PET for 220.6.10 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.11- FDG PET for Thyroid 220.6.11 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.12- FDG PET for So Tissue 220.6.12 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.13 - FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for Dementia and Neurodegenerative Diseases (Effective September 15, 2004) (Rev. 173, Issued: 09- 04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD -10, Implementation: of ICD -10) A. General Medicare covers FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans for either the differential diagnosis of fronto- temporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) under specific requirements; OR, its use in a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) -approved practical clinical trial focused on the utility of FDG PET in the diagnosis or treatment of dementing neurodegenerative diseases. Specific requirements for each indication are clarified below: B. Nationally Covered Indications 1. FDG PET Requirements for Coverage in the Differential Diagnosis of AD and FTD An FDG PET scan is considered reasonable and necessary in patients with a recent diagnosis of dementia and documented cognitive decline of at least 6 months, who meet diagnostic criteri a for both AD and FTD. These patients have been evaluated for specific alternate neurodegenerative diseases or other causative factors, but the cause of the clinical symptoms remains uncertain. The following additional conditions must be met before an FD G PET scan will be covered: a. The patient's onset, clinical presentation, or course of cognitive impairment is such that FTD is suspected as an alternative neurodegenerative cause of the cognitive decline. Specifically, symptoms such as social disinhibition, awkwardness, difficulties with language, or loss of executive function are more prominent early in the course of FTD than the memory loss typical of AD; b. The patient has had a comprehensive clinical evaluation (as defined by the American Academy of Neurology encompassing a medic al history from the patient and a well- acquainted informant (including assessment of activities of daily living), physical and mental status examination (including formal documentation of cognitive decline occurring over at least 6 months) aided by cogniti ve scales or neuropsychological testing, laboratory tests, and structural imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT); c. The evaluation of the patient has been conducted by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and ass essment of dementia; d. The evaluation of the patient did not clearly determine a specific neurodegenerative disease or other cause for the clinical symptoms, and information available through FDG PET is reasonably expected to help clarify the diagnosis between FTD and AD and help guide future treatment; e. The FDG PET scan is performed in a facility that has all the accreditation necessary to operate nuclear medicine equipment. The reading of the scan should be done by an expert in nuclear medicine, rad iology, neurology, or psychiatry, with experience interpreting such scans in the presence of dementia; f. A brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or FDG PET scan has not been obtained for the same indication. (The indication can be considered to be different in patients who exhibit important changes in scope or severity of cognitive decline, and meet all other qualifying criteria listed above and below (including the judgment that the likely diagnosis remains uncertain.) The results of a prior SPECT or FDG PET scan must have been inconclusive or, in the case of SPECT, difficult to interpret due to immature or inadequate technology. In these instances, an FDG PET scan may be covered after 1 year has passed from the time the first SPECT or FDG PET scan was performed.) g. The referring and billing provider(s) have documented the appropriate evaluation of the Medicare beneficiary. Providers should establish the medical necessity of an FDG PET scan by ensuring that the following information has been collected and is maintained in the beneficiary medical record: o Date of onset of symptoms; o Diagnosis of clinical syndrome (normal aging; mild cognitive impairment (MCI); mild, moderate or severe dementia); o Mini mental status exam (MMSE) or similar test score; o Presumptive cause (possible, probable, uncertain AD); o Any neuropsychological testing performed; o Results of any structural imaging (MRI or CT) performed; o Relevant laboratory tests (B12, thyroid hormone); and, o Number and name of prescribed medications. The billing provider must furnish a copy of the FDG PET scan result for use by CMS and its MACs upon request. These verification requirements are consistent with Federal requirements set forth in 42 Code of Federal Regulations, section 410.32 generally for diagnostic x- ray tests, diagnostic laboratory tests, and other tests. In summary, section 410.32 requires the billing physician and the referring physician to maintain information in the medical record of each patient to demonstrate medical n ecessity [410.32(d) (2)] and submit the information demonstrating medical necessity to CMS and/or its agents upon request [410.32(d)(3)(I)] (OMB number 0938- 0685). 2. FDG PET Requirements for Coverage in the Context of a CMS -approved Practical Clinical Trial Utilizing a Specific Protocol to Demonstrate the Utility of FDG PET in the Diagnosis, and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Dementing Diseases An FDG PET scan is considered reasonable and necessary in patients with MCI or early dementia (in cl inical circumstances other than those specified in subparagraph 1) only in the context of an approved clinical trial that contains patient safeguards and protections to ensure proper administration, use and evaluation of the FDG PET scan. The clinical trial must compare patients who do and do not receive an FDG PET scan and have as its goal to monitor, evaluate, and improve clinical outcomes. In addition, it must meet the following basic criteria: a. Written protocol on file; b. Institutional Review Board review and approval; c. Scientific review and approval by two or more qualified individuals who are not part of the research team; and, d. Certification that investigators have not been disqualified. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications All other uses of FDG PET for patients with a presumptive diagnosis of dementia -causing neurodegenerative disease (e.g., possible or probable AD, clinically typical FTD, dementia of Lewy bodies, or Creutzfeld- Jacob disease) for which CMS has not specifically indicated coverage continue to be non- covered. D. Other Not applicable. 220.6.14- FDG PET for Brain, Cervical, Ovarian, Pancreatic, Small Cell Lung, and Testicular Cancers 220.6.14 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.15- FDG PET for All Other Cancer Indications Not Previously Specified (RETIRED) (Rev. 11892; Iss ued: 03 220.6.15 has been removed from the NCD Manual and replaced with section 220.6.17 effective April 3, 2009. 220.6.16- FDG PET for Infection Inflammation 1, 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services determined that no national coverage determination (NCD) is appropriate at this time for FDG PET for Inflammation and Infection. In the absence of an NCD, coverage determinations will be made by the Medicare Administrative Contractors under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of t he Social Security Act. 220.6.17 - Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) f or Oncologic Conditions (Effective June 11, 2013) (Rev. 173, Issued: 09- 04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD minimally -invasive diagnostic imaging procedure used to evaluate glucose metabolism in normal tissue as well as in diseased tissues in conditions such as cancer, ischemic heart disease, and some neurologic disorders. FDG is an injected radionuclide (or radiopharmaceutical) that emits sub -atomic particles, known as positrons, as it decays. FDG PET uses a positron camera (tomograph) to measure the decay of FDG. The rate of FDG decay provides biochemical information on glucose metabolism in the tissue being studied. As malignancies can cause abnormalities of metabolism and blood flow, FDG PET evaluation may indicate the probable presence or absence of a malignancy based upon obse rved differences in biologic activity compared to adjacent tissues. The Centers for Medicare and M edicaid Services (CMS) was asked by the National Oncologic PET Registry (NOPR) to r econside r section 220.6 of the National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Manual to e nd the prospective data collection re quirements under Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) a cross a ll oncologic indications of FDG P ET imaging. The CMS receiv ed publ ic input indi cating that the current coverage framework of prospective data collection under CED be ended for all oncologic uses of FDG PET imaging. 1. Framework Effective for claims with d ates of service on a nd after June 11, 2013, C MS is adopting a coverage framework tha t ends the prospective data collection requirements by NOPR under CED for all oncologic uses of FDG PET imaging . CMS is m aking this c hange for all NCDs th at address coverage of FDG PET for oncologic uses addressed in this decisi on. This decision does not change coverage for any use of PET imaging using radiopharmaceuticals NaF -18 (fluorine - 18 labeled sodium fluoride), ammonia N -13, or rubidium -82 (Rb- 82). 2. Initial A nti-Tumor Treatment Strategy CMS continues to believe that the evidence is adequate to de termine that the results of FDG PET im aging ar e useful in de termining the appropriate initia l anti- tumor trea tment strategy for beneficiaries with susp ected cancer and improve health out comes and thus are reasonable and necessary under \u00a71862(a)(1 )(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act). Therefore, CMS continues to nationally cover one FDG PET study f or beneficiaries who ha ve cancers th at are biops y proven or strongly suspected based on othe r diagnostic testing whe n the beneficiary's treating physician determines that the FDG P ET study is needed to de termine the location a nd/or e xtent of the tumor for the following therapeutic purposes related to the initia l anti-tumor t reatme nt strategy: To determine whether or not the beneficiary is an appropriate candida te for an inva sive diagnostic or therapeutic procedur e; or To determine al anatomic location for an inva sive procedu re; or To determine the anatomic extent tumor when the recomm ended anti-tumor treatme nt reasona bly depends on t he extent of the tumo r. See the table at the end of this section for a synopsis of all nationally covered and non- covered oncologic uses of FDG PET imaging. B.1. Initial Anti- Tumor Treatment Strategy Nationally Covered Indications a. CMS continues to na tionally cover FDG P ET im aging for the initia l anti- tumor tre atment strategy for male and fe male breast cancer only when used in staging distant metastasis. b. CMS continues to nationally cover FDG PET to determine initia l anti -tumor treatme nt strategy for m elanoma other than for the evaluation of regional lymph nodes. c. CMS continues to nationally cover FDG P ET im aging for the detection of pre-treatme nt metastasis (i.e., staging) in newly diagnosed cer vical cancers. C.1 Initial Anti- Tumor Treatment Strategy Nationally Non- Covered Indications a. CMS continues to nationally non- cover initial anti -tumor treatment strategy in Medicare beneficiaries who have adenocarcinoma of the prostate. b. CMS continues to nationally non- cover FDG P ET im aging for diagnosis of breast cancer and initi al staging of axillary node s. c. CMS continues to natio nally non- cover FDG P ET imaging for initial anti- tumor treatment strategy f or the evaluation of regional lymph nod es in m elanoma. d. CMS continues to na tionally non-cover FDG PET imaging for the diagnosis of cervical cancer related to initia l anti- tumor t reatme nt strategy. 3. Subs equent Anti-Tumor Treatment Strategy B.2. Subsequent Anti -Tumor Treatment Strategy Nationally Covered Indications Three FDG PET scans are nationally covered when used to guide subsequent management of anti-tumor treatment strategy after completion of initial anti- cancer therapy. Coverage of more than three FDG PET scans to guide subsequent management of anti -tumor tr eatment strategy after completion of initial anti- cancer therapy shall be determined by the MACs. 4.

Other N/A 220.6.19 - Positron Emission Tomography NaF- 18 (NaF- 18 PET) to Identify Bone Metastasis of Cancer (Effective February 26, 2010) (Rev. 11158, Effective:12-15-2017, Implementation: 01-27-22) is a minimal ly-invasive, diagnostic imaging procedure that assesses the level of metabolic activity and perfusion in various organ systems of the body. A positron camera (tomograph) is used to produce cross-sectional tomographic images, which are obtained from positron- emitting radioactive tracer substances (radiopharmaceuticals) such as F -18 sodium fluoride (NaF-18). B. Nationally Covered Indications The confirmatory analyses were not published during the 24-month time period. Therefore, effective December 15, 2017, CMS determines that there are no nationally covered indications for PET NaF -18. C. Nationally Non- Covered Indications Effective December 15, 2017, CMS determines that PET NaF-18 PET is nationally non-covered. D. Other Other PET radiopharmaceutical tracers for cancer can be covered at local Medicare Administrative Contractor discretion when used according to their FDA- approved indication(s). (This NCD last reviewed December 2017.) 220.6.20 - Beta Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography in 03-27-14, Effective: 09-27-13, Implementation: 07-07-14) A. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that the evidence is insufficient to conclude that the use of positron emission tomography (PET) beta amyloid (also referred to as amyloid -beta (A)) imaging is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member for Medicare beneficiaries with dementia or neurodegenerative disease, and thus PET A imaging is not covered under \u00a71862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (\"the Act \"). B. However, there is sufficient evidence that the use of PET A imaging is promising in two scenarios: (1) to exclude Alzheimer's disease (AD) in narrowly defined and clinically difficult differential diagnoses, such as AD versus frontotemporal dementia (FTD); and (2) to enrich clinical trials seeking better treatments or prevention strategies for AD, by allowing for selection of patients on the basis of biological as well as clinical and epidemiological factors. Therefore, we will cover one PET A sc an per patient through coverage with evidence development (CED), under \u00a71862(a)(1)(E) of the Act, in clinical studies that meet the criteria in each of the paragraphs below. Clinical study objectives must be to (1) develop better treatments or prevention strategies for AD, or, as a strategy to identify subpopulations at risk for developing AD, or (2) resolve clinically difficult differential diagnoses (e.g., frontotemporal dementia (FTD) versus AD) where the use of PET A imaging appears to improve health outcomes. These may include short term outcomes related to changes in management as well as longer term dementia outcomes. Clinical studies must be approved by CMS, involve subjects from appropriate populations, and be comparative and longitudinal. Wher e appropriate, studies should be prospective, randomized, and use postmortem diagnosis as the endpoint. Radiopharmaceuticals used in the PET A scans must be FDA approved. Approved studies must address one or more aspects of the following questions. For Medicare beneficiaries with cognitive impairment suspicious for AD, or who may be at risk for developing AD: 1. Do the results of PET A imaging lead to improved health outcomes? Meaningful health outcomes of interest include: avoidance of futile treatment or tests; improving, or slowing the decline of, quality of life; and survival. 2. Are there specific subpopulations, patient characteristics or differential diagnoses that are predictive of improved health outcomes in patients whose management is guided by the PET A imaging? 3. Does using PET A imaging in guiding patient management, to enrich clinical trials seeking better treatments or prevention strategies for AD, by selecting patients on the basis of biological as well as clinical and epidemiological fac tors, lead to improved health outcomes? Any clinical study undertaken pursuant to this national coverage determination (NCD) must adhere to the timeframe designated in the approved clinical study protocol. Any approved clinical study must also adhere to the following standards of scientific integrity and relevance to the Medicare population. a. The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a particular intervention potentially improves the participants' health outcomes. b. The research study is well supported by available scientific and medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use. c. The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing studies. d. The research study design is appropriate to answer the research question being asked in the study. e. The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of executing the proposed study successfully. f. The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it must be in compliance with 21 CFR parts 50 and 56. g. All aspe cts of the research study are conducted according to appropriate standards of scientific integrity (see http://www.icmje.org ). h. The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or incorporates by reference, the standards listed here as Medicare requirements. i. The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR \u00a7312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options. j. The clinical research study is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject. k. The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all pre- specified outcomes to be meas ured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or the study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 24 months of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to be published in a peer reviewed journal, then that initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (http://www.icmje.org). However a full report of the outcomes must be made public no later than three (3) years after the end of data collection. l. The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations on the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are necessary. m. The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necess ary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability or Medicaid eligibility. Consistent with \u00a71142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) supports clinical research studies that CMS determines meet the above -listed standards and address the above- listed research questions. All other uses are noncovered. 220.7 Xenon of ICD -10) Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is a diagnostic imaging technique that applies computer technology to fluoroscopy for the purpose of visualizing the same vascular structures observable with conventional angiography. Since the radiographic contrast material can be injected into a vein rather than an artery, the procedure reduces the risk to patients, and can be done on an outpatient basis. A/B MACs (A) and (B) should be alert to possible increases in utilization of DSA over conventional angiographic procedures, as well as to the fact that ordinarily patients should not require inpatient hospitalization solely to perform the procedure. Payment for DSA should not exceed, and may be less than, that being paid for conventional angiographic techniques. 220.10 - Portable Hand -Held X -Ray Instrument (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 50 -48 This low intensity x -ray imaging device is a light weight portable hand-held instrument using a low level isotope as its penetrating energy source. It can picture any part of the human anatomy that can be inserted in the space between the energy source and the viewi ng mechanism. The device can be useful in making an immediate diagnosis in the following settings: isolated areas, accident scenes, sports events and emergency rooms. It is also useful in the following instances where fluoroscopy would ordinarily be used: localization of foreign bodies, selected surgical procedures and the evaluation of premature or low birth weight infants. The use of the portable hand- held x- ray instrument as an imaging device is covered under Medicare. It should be reimbursed as par t of the physicians' professional service, and no additional charge should be allowed. 220.11 - Thermography (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 50 -5 Thermography is the measurement of self -emanating infrared radiation that reveals temperature variations at the surfa ce of the body. The thermographic device senses body temperature and demonstrates areas of differing heat emission by producing brightly colored patterns. Each color represents a specific temperature level. Interpretation of these color patterns accordi ng to designated anatomic distribution is thought to aid in diagnosing a vast array of diseases. Thermography for any indication (including breast lesions which were excluded from Medicare coverage on July 20, 1984) is excluded from Medicare coverage beca use the available evidence does not support this test as a useful aid in the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury. Therefore, it is not considered effective. This exclusion was published as a CMS Final Notice in the \"Federal Register\" on November 20, 1992. 220.12 - -10) The single photon emission computed tomograph (SPECT) acquires information on the concentration of radionuclides introduced into the patient's body. It is useful in the diagnosis of several clinical conditions including: Stress fracture Spondylosis Infec tion (e.g., discitis) Tumor (e.g., osteoid osteoma) Analyze blood flow to an organ, as in the case of myocardial viability Differentiate ischemic heart disease from dilated cardiomyopathy. Frequency limitations: A/B MAC (A)'s or case of myocardial viability, FDG positron emission tomography (PET) may be used following a SPECT that was found to be inconclusive. However, SPECT may not be used following an inconclusive FDG PET performed to evaluate myocardial viability. 220.13 - ICD -10) Percutaneous image- guided breast biopsy is a method of obtaining a breast biopsy through a percutaneous incision by employing image guidance systems. Image guidance systems may be either ultrasound or stereotactic. The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (or BIRADS system) employed by the American College of Radiology provides a standardized lexicon with which radiologists may report their interpretation of a mammogram. The BIRADS grading of mammograms is as follows: Grade I -Negative, Grade II -Benign finding, Grade III -Probably benign, Grade IV - Suspicious abnormality, and Grade V -Highly suggestive of malignant neoplasm. A. Non -Palpable Breast Lesions Effective January 1, 2003, Medicare covers percutaneous image -guided breast biopsy using stereotactic or ultrasound imaging for a radiographic abnormality that is non- palpable and is graded as a BIRADS III, IV, or V. B. Palpable Breast Lesions Effective January 1, 2003, Medicare covers percutaneous image guided breast biopsy using stereotactic or ultrasound imaging for palpable lesions that are difficult to biopsy using palpation alone. A/B MACs (A) and (B) have the discretion to decide what types of palpable lesions are difficult to biopsy using palpation. 230 - Renal and Genitourinary System - ESRD Services 230.1 - Treatment of Kidney Stones (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 35 -81 Traditional a pproaches for the treatment of kidney stones are the surgical technique nephrectomy (or nephrotomy) and endoscopic treatments via the urethra. In the last few years, several new approaches in the surgical management of upper urinary tract kidney stones ha ve been developed, among them invasive and noninvasive lithotripsy techniques. In addition to the traditional surgical/endoscopic techniques for the treatment of kidney stones, the following lithotripsy techniques are also covered for services rendered on or after March 15, 1985. A. Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) is a noninvasive method of treating kidney stones using a device called a lithotriptor. The lithotriptor uses shock waves generated outside of the body to break up upper urinary tract stones. It focuses the shock waves specifically on stones under x- ray visualization, pulverizing them by repeated shocks. ESWL is covered under Medicare for use in the treatment of upper urinary tract kidney st ones. B. Percutaneous Lithotrips y Percutaneous lithotripsy (or nephrolithotomy) is an invasive method of treating kidney stones by using ultrasound, electrohydraulic or mechanical lithotripsy. A probe is inserted through an incision in the skin directly over the kidney and applied to the stone. A form of lithotripsy is then used to fragment the stone. Mechanical or electrohydraulic lithotripsy may be used as an alternative or adjunct to ultrasonic lithotripsy. Percutaneous lithotripsy of kidney stones by ultrasound or by the related techniques of electrohydraulic or mechanical lithotripsy is covered under Medicare. The following is covered for services rendered on or after January 16, 1988. C. Transurethral Ureteroscopic Lithotripsy Transure thral ureteroscopic lithotripsy is a method of fragmenting and removing ureteral and renal stones through a cystoscope. The cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. Catheters are passed through the scope into the opening where the ure ters enter the bladder. Instruments passed through this opening into the ureters are used to manipulate and ultimately disintegrate stones, using either mechanical crushing, transcystoscopic electrohydraulic shock waves, ultrasound, or laser. Transurethr al ureteroscopic lithotripsy for the treatment of urinary tract stones of the kidney or ureter is covered under Medicare. 230.2 - Uroflowmetric Evaluations (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 50 -33 Uroflowmetric evaluations (also referred to as urodynamic voiding or urodynamic flow studies) are covered under Medicare for diagnosing various urological dysfunctions, including bladder outlet obstructions. 230.3 - Sterilization Upon Implementation of ICD -10) A. Nationally Covered Conditions Payment may be made only where sterilization is a necessary part of the treatment of an illness or injury, e.g., removal of a uterus because of a tumor or removal of diseased ovaries. Sterilization of a mentally challenged beneficiary is covered if it is a necessary part of the treatment of an illness or injury (bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral orchidectomy in a case of cancer of the prostate). The A/B MAC (A) or (B) denies claims when the pathological evidence of the necessity to perform any such procedures to treat an illness or injury is absent; and Monitor such surgeries closely and obtain the information needed to determine whether in fact the surgery was performed as a mean s of treating an illness or injury or only to achieve sterilization. B. Nationally Non-Covered Conditions Elective hysterectomy, tubal ligation, and vasectomy, if the primary indication for these procedures is sterilization; A sterilization that is performed because a physician believes another pregnancy would endanger the overall general health of the woman is not considered to be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury within the meaning of \u00a71862(a)(1) of the Social Security Act. The sam e conclusion would apply where the sterilization is performed only as a measure to prevent the possible development of, or effect on, a mental condition should the individual become pregnant; and sterilization of a mentally retarded person where the purpose is to prevent conception, rather than the treatment of an illness or injury. 230.4 - Diagnosis and Treatment of Impotence (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 35 -24 Program payment may be made for diagnosis and treatment of sexual impotence. Impotence is a failure of a body part for which the diagnosis, and frequently the treatment, require medical expertise. Depending on the cause of the condition, treatment may be surgical; e.g., implantation of a penile prosthesis, or nonsurgical; e.g., medical or psychotherapeutic treatment. Since causes and, therefore, appropriate treatment vary, if abuse is suspected it may be necessary to request documentation of appropriateness in individual cases. If treatment is furnished to patients (other than hospital inpatients) in connection with a mental condition, apply the psychiatric service limitation described in the Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manu al, Chapter 3. 230.5 - Gravlee Jet Washer (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 50 -4 The Gravlee Jet Washer is a sterile, disposable, diagnostic device for detecting endometrial cancer. The use of this device is indicated where the patient exhibits clinical symptoms o r signs suggestive of endometrial disease, such as irregular or heavy vaginal bleeding. Program payment cannot be made for the washer or the related diagnostic services when furnished in connection with the examination of an asymptomatic patient. Payment for routine physical checkups is precluded under the statute. (See \u00a71862(a)(7) of the Act.) (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 16, \"General Exclusions From Coverage,\" \u00a790). 230.6 - Vabra 10-03-03) CIM 50 -10 The VABRA aspirator is a sterile, disposable, vacuum aspirator which is used to collect uterine tissue for study to detect endometrial carcinoma. The use of this device is indicated where the patient exhibits clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of endometrial disease, such as irregular or heavy vaginal bleeding. Program payment cannot be made for the aspirator or the related diagnostic services when furnished in connection with the examination of an asymptomatic patient. Payment for routine physical checkups is precluded under the statute (\u00a71862(a)(7) of the Act). Cross -reference: See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 16, \"General Exclusions From Coverage,\" \u00a790, and \u00a7230.5 of this manual. 230.7 - Water Purification and Softening Systems Used in Conjunct ion With Home Dialysis (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04- 14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD -10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) A. Water Purification Systems Water used for home dialysis should be chemically free of heavy trace metals and/or organic contaminants that could be hazardous to the patient. It should also be as free of bacteria as possible but need not be biologically sterile. Since the characteristics of natural water supplies in most areas of the country are such t hat some type of water purification system is needed, such a system used in conjunction with a home dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis) unit is covered under Medicare. There are two types of water purification systems that will satisfy these requirements: Deionization - The removal of organic substances, mineral salts of magnesium and calcium (causing hardness), compounds of fluoride and chloride from tap water using the process of filtration and ion exchange; or Reverse Osmosis (RO) - The proce ss used to remove impurities from tap water utilizing pressure to force water through a porous membrane. Use of both a deionization unit and RO unit in series, theoretically to provide the advantages of both systems, has been determined medically unnecess ary since either system can provide water which is both chemically and bacteriologically pure enough for acceptable use in home dialysis. In addition, spare deionization tanks are not covered since they are essentially a precautionary supply rather than a current requirement for treatment of the patient. Activated carbon filters used as a component of water purification systems to remove unsafe concentrations of chlorine and chloramines are covered when prescribed by a physician. B. Water Softening Syst em Except as indicated below, a water softening system used in conjunction with home dialysis is excluded from coverage under Medicare as not being reasonable and necessary within the meaning of \u00a71862(a)(1) of the Social Security Act. Such a system, in conjunction with a home dialysis unit, does not adequately remove the hazardous heavy metal contaminants (such as arsenic) which may be present in trace amounts. A water softening system may be covered when used to pretreat water to be purified by a RO unit for home dialysis where: The manufacturer of the RO unit has set standards for the quality of water entering the RO (e.g., the water to be purified by the RO must be of a certain quality if the unit is to perform as intended); The patient's water is demonstrated to be of a lesser quality than required; and, The softener is used only to soften water entering the RO unit, and thus, used only for dialysis. (The softener need not actually be built into the RO unit, but must be an integral part of the dialysis system.) C. Developing Need When a Water Softening System is Replaced with a Water Purification Unit in an Existing Home Dialysis System The medical necessity of water purification units must be carefully developed when they replace water softening systems in existing home dialysis systems. A purification system may be ordered under these circumstances for a number of reasons. For example, changes in the medical community's opinions regarding the quality of water necessary for safe dialysis may lead the physician to decide the quality of water previously used should be improved, or the water quality itself may have deteriorated. Patients m ay have dialyzed using only an existing water softener previous to Medicare end- stage renal disease coverage because of inability to pay for a purification system. On the other hand, in some cases, the installation of a purification system is not medically necessary. Thus, when such a case comes to the A/B MAC (A)'s attention, the MAC asks the physician to furnish the reason for the changes. Supporting documentation, such as the suppliers' recommendations or water analysis, may be required. All such cases should be reviewed by the MAC's medical consultants. Cross reference: - The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Health Services,\" \u00a7110. 230.8 - Non-Implantable Dates: 06 -19-06) pelvic floor electrical stimulators provide neuromuscular electrical stimulation through the pelvic floor with the intent of strengthening and exercising pelvic floor musculature. Stimulation is generally delivered by vaginal or anal probes connected to an external pulse generator. The methods of pelvic floor electrical stimulation vary in location, stimulus frequency (Hz), stimulus intensity or amplitude (mA), pulse duration (duty cycle), treatments per day, number of treatment days per week, length of time for each treatment session, overall time period for device use and between clinic and home settings. In general, the stimulus frequency and other parameters are chosen based on the patient's clinical diagnosis. Pelvic floor electrical stimulation with a non -implantable stimulator is covered for the treatment of stress and/or urge urinary incontinence in cognitively intact patients who have failed a documented tria l of pelvic muscle exercise (PME) training. A failed trial of PME training is defined as no clinically significant improvement in urinary continence after completing 4 weeks of an ordered plan of pelvic muscle exercises designed to increase periurethral m uscle strength. 230.9 - Cryosurgery of Prostate (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 35 -96 Cryosurgery of the prostate gland, also known as cryosurgical ablation of the prostate (CSAP), destroys prostate tissue by applying extremely cold temperatures in order to reduc e the size of the prostate gland. It is safe and effective, as well as medically necessary and appropriate, as primary treatment for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, Stages T1 -T3. Cryosurgery of the prostate as a salvage therapy is not covered for any services performed prior to June 30, 2001. Salvage Cryosurgery Of Prostate After Radiation Failure. Salvage cryosurgery of the prostate for recurrent cancer is medically necessary and appropriate only for those patients with localized disease who: 1. Have failed a trial of radiation therapy as their primary treatment; and 2. Meet one of the following conditions: Stage T2B or below, Gleason score < 9, PSA < 8 ng/mL. Cryosurgery as salvage therapy is therefore not covered under Medicare after failure of other therapies as the primary treatment. Cryosurgery as salvage is only covered after the failure of a trial of radiation therapy, under the conditions noted above. 230.10 - Incontinence Control Devices (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 6 5-9 A. Mechanical/Hydraulic Incontinence Control Devices Mechanical/hydraulic incontinence control devices are accepted as safe and effective in the management of urinary incontinence in patients with permanent anatomic and neurologic dysfunctions of the bladder. This class of devices achieves control of urination by compression of the urethra. The materials used and the success rate may vary somewhat from device to device. Such a device is covered when its use is reasonable and necessary for the indi vidual patient. B. Collagen Implant A collagen implant which is injected into the submucosal tissues of the urethra and/or the bladder neck and into tissues adjacent to the urethra, is a prosthetic device used in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence resulting from intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD). ISD is a cause of stress urinary incontinence in which the urethral sphincter is unable to contract and generate sufficient resistance in the bladder, especially during stress maneuvers. Prior to c ollagen implant therapy, a skin test for collagen sensitivity must be administered and evaluated over a 4 -week period. In male patients, the evaluation must include a complete history and physical examination and a simple cystometrogram to determine that the bladder fills and stores properly. The patient then is asked to stand upright with a full bladder and to cough or otherwise exert abdominal pressure on his bladder. If the patient leaks, the diagnosis of ISD is established. In female patients, the evaluation must include a complete history and physical examination (including a pelvic exam) and a simple cystometrogram to rule out abnormalities of bladder compliance and abnormalities of urethral support. Following that determination, an abdominal leak point pressure (ALLP) test is performed. Leak point pressure, stated in cm H2O, is defined as the intra -abdominal pressure at which leakage occurs from the bladder (around a catheter) when the bladder has been filled with a minimum of 150 cc fluid. If the patient has an ALLP of less than 100 cm H2O, the diagnosis of ISD is established. To use a collagen implant, physicians must have urology training in the use of a cystoscope and must complete a collagen implant training program. Coverag e of a collagen implant, and the procedure to inject it, is limited to the following types of patients with stress urinary incontinence due to ISD: Male or female patients with congenital sphincter weakness secondary to conditions such as myelomeningocele or epispadias; Male or female patients with acquired sphincter weakness secondary to spinal cord lesions; Male patients following trauma, including prostatectomy and/or radiation; and Female patients without urethral hypermobility and with abdominal le ak point pressures of 100 cm H2O or less. Patients whose incontinence does not improve with five injection procedures (five separate treatment sessions) are considered treatment failures, and no further treatment of urinary incontinence by collagen implant is covered. Patients who have a reoccurr ence of incontinence following successful treatment with collagen implants in the past (e.g., 6-12 months previously) may benefit from additional treatment sessions. Coverage of additional sessions may be allowed but must be supported by medical justifica tion. See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Health Services,\" \u00a7120. (See (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 45-23 The DMSO is an industrial solvent produced as a chemical byproduct of paper production from wood pulp. The Food and Drug Administration has determined that the only purpose for which DMSO is safe and effective for humans is in the treatment of the bladder condition, interstitial cystitis. Therefore, the use of DMSO for all other indications is not considered to be reasonable and necessary. Payment may be made for its use only when reasonable and necessary for a patient in the treatment of interstitial cystitis. 230.13 - Peridex CAPD Filter Set (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 55 -2 The Peridex Filter Set is used by home continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. The Peridex Filter Set is designed to provide sterile filtration during infusion of the dialysis solution in a beneficiary's peritoneal cavity; included in the filter set is a bacterial filter designed to block peritonitis-causing organisms and thus reduce the incidence of peritonitis. Based upon advice of our medical consultants, CMS has determined that the Peridex CAPD Filter Set cannot be covered at this time by Medicare because it has not yet been shown to be safe and effective in preventing peritonitis. 230.14 - Ultrafiltration Monitor (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 55 -3 The Ultrafiltration Monitor is designed to reduce the clinical risks of overfiltration and underfiltration during hemodialysis. Overfiltration is the removal of too much fluid from body tissues and underfiltration is removal of too little fluid. Covered Ultrafiltration and ultrafiltration monitoring as a component of hemodialysis has an established and critical role in maintaining the well-being of ESRD patients and is a covered service. The Ultrafiltration Monitor is covered under the Medicare program when it is used to calculate fluid rates for those recipients who present difficult fluid management problems. Determine the medical necessity of this device on a case -by-case basis. Not Covered Ultrafiltration, independent of conventional dialysis, is considered experimental, and technology exclusively designed for this purpose is not covered under Medicare. 230.15 - Electrical Continence Aid (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 65 -2 Not Covered An electrical continence aid is a device consisting of a plastic plug , molded into the shape of the patient's anal canal which contains two implanted electrodes that are connected by a wire to a small portable generator. An electrical current is produced which stimulates the anal musculature to cause a contraction sufficient to hold the plug in while allowing the patient to ambulate without incontinence. Electrical continence aids are in the experimental stage of development and there is no valid scientific documentation of their effectiveness and safety. Therefore, they are not covered under Medicare since they cannot be considered to be reasonable and necessary for the treatment of an illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member as required by \u00a71862(a)(1) of the Act. 230.16 - Bladder Stimulators (Pacemakers) (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 65 -11 Not Covered There are a number of devices available to induce emptying of the urinary bladder by using electrical current which forces the muscles of the bladder to contract. These devices (commonly known as bladder stimulators or pacemakers) are characterized by the implantation of elec trodes in the wall of the bladder, the rectal cones, or the spinal cord. While these treatments may effectively empty the bladder, the issue of safety involving the initiation of infection, erosion, placement, and material selection has not been resolved. Further, some facilities previously using electronic emptying have stopped using this method due to the pain experienced by the patient. The use of spinal cord electrical stimulators, rectal electrical stimulators, and bladder wall stimulators is not co nsidered reasonable and necessary. Therefore, no program payment may be made for these devices or for their implant. 230.17 - Urinary Drainage Bags (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 65 -17 Urinary collection and retention systems are covered as prosthetic devices t hat replace bladder function in the case of permanent urinary incontinence. Urinary drainage bags that can be used either as bedside or leg drainage bags may be either multi -use or single use systems. Both the multi- use and the single use bags have a sys tem that prevents urine backflow. However, the single use system is non- drainable. There is insufficient evidence to support the medical necessity of a single use system bag rather than the multi -use bag. Therefore, a single use drainage system is subje ct to the same coverage parameters as the multi -use drainage bags. 230.18 - Sacral Nerve Stimulation for Urinary Incontinence (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 65 -18 Effective January 1, 2002, sacral nerve stimulation is covered for the treatment of urinary urge incontinence, urgency- frequency syndrome, and urinary retention. Sacral nerve stimulation involves both a temporary test stimulation to determine if an implantable stimulator would be effective and a permanent implantation in appropriate candidates. Both the test and the permanent implantation are covered. The following limitations for coverage apply to all three indications: Patient must be refractory to conventional therapy (documented behavioral, pharmacologic and/or surgical corrective therapy) and be an appropriate surgical candidate such that implantation with anesthesia can occur. Patients with stress incontinence, urinary obstruction, and specific neurologic diseases (e.g., diabetes with peripheral nerve involvement) which are associated with secondary manifestations of the above three indications are excluded. Patient must have had a successful test stimulation in order to support subsequent implantation. Before a patient is eligible for permanent implantation, he/she must demonstrate a 50 percen t or greater improvement through test stimulation. Improvement is measured through voiding diaries. Patient must be able to demonstrate adequate ability to record voiding diary data such that clinical results of the implant procedure can be properly evaluated. 230.19 - Levocarnitine for Use in the Treatment of Carnitine Deficiency in is a naturally occurring substance that functions in the transport of the long- chain fatty acids for energy production by the body. Deficiency can occur due to a congenital defect in synthesis or utilization, or from dialysis. The causes of carnitine deficiency in hemodialysis patients include dialytic los s, reduced renal synthesis and reduced dietary intake. Intravenous levocarnitine, for one of the following indications, will only be covered for those ESRD patients who have been on dialysis for a minimum of three months. Patients must have documented ca rnitine deficiency, defined as a plasma free carnitine level < 40 micromol/L (determined by a professionally accepted method as recognized in current literature), along with signs and symptoms of: Erythropoietin- resistant anemia (persistent hematocrit < 30 percent with treatment) that has not responded to standard erthropoietin dosage (that which is considered clinically appropriate to treat the particular patient) with iron replacement, and for which other causes have been investigated and adequately trea ted, or Hypotension on hemodialysis that interferes with delivery of the intended dialysis despite application of usual measures deemed appropriate (e.g., fluid management). Such episodes of hypotension must have occurred during at least 2 dialysis treat ments in a 30- day period. Continued use of levocarnitine will not be covered if improvement has not been demonstrated within 6 months of initiation of treatment. All other indications for levocarnitine are noncovered in the ESRD population. For a patien t currently receiving intravenous levocarnitine, Medicare will cover continued treatment if: Levocarnitine has been administered to treat erythropoietin- resistant anemia (persistent hematocrit < 30 percent with treatment) that has not responded to standar d erythropoietin dosage (that which is considered clinically appropriate to treat the particular patient) with iron replacement, and for which other causes have been investigated and adequately treated, or hypotension on hemodialysis that interferes with d elivery of the intended dialysis despite application of usual measures deemed appropriate (e.g., fluid management) and such episodes of hypotension occur during at least 2 dialysis treatments in a 30- day period; and The patient's medical record documents a pre -dialysis plasma free carnitine level < 40 micromol/L prior to the initiation of treatment; or The treating physician certifies (documents in the medical record) that in his/her judgment, if treatment with the levocarnitine is discontinued, the patient's pre -dialysis carnitine level would fall below 40 micromol/L and the patient would have recurrent erythropoietin- resistant -anemia or intradialytic hypotension. 240 - Respiratory System (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) 240.1 - Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (Reduction Pneumoplasty) (Various Effective Dates Below) (Rev. 44, Issued: 12- 02-05; Effective: 11 -17-05; Implementation: 03- 02-06) Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) or reduction pneumoplasty, also referred to as lung shaving or lung contouring, is performed on patients with severe emphysema in order to allow the remaining compressed lung to expand, and thus, improve respiratory function. Medicare-covered LVRS approaches are limited to bilateral excision of a damaged lung with stapling performed via median sternotomy or video- assisted thoracoscopic surgery. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for services performed on or a fter January 1, 2004, Medicare will only consider LVRS reasonable and necessary when all of the following requirements are met (note varying dates for facility criteria in section 3. below): 1. The patient satisfies all the criteria outlined below: Assess ment Criteria History and physical examination Consistent with emphysema BMI, 31.1 kg/m 2 (men) or 32.3 kg/m 2 (women) Stable with 20 mg prednisone (or equivalent) qd Radiographic High Resolution Computer Tomography (HRCT) scan evidence of bilateral emphysema Pulmonary function (pre-rehabilitation) Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 45% predicted (15% predicted if age 70 years) Total lung capacity (TLC) 100% predicted post - bronchodilator Residual volume (RV) 150% predicted post -bronchodilator Arterial blood gas level (pre - rehabilitation) PCO 2, 60 mm Hg (PCO 2, 55 mm Hg if 1 -mile above sea level) PO 2, 45 mm Hg on room air (PO 2, 30 mm Hg if 1 -mile above sea level) Cardiac assessment Approval for surgery by cardiologist if any of the following are present: Unstable angina; left -ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from the echocardiogram; LVEF <45%; dobutamine -radionuclide cardiac dysfunction; arrhythmia (>5 premature ventricular other than sinus; premature ventricular contractions on EKG at rest) Surgical assessment Approval for surgery by pulmonary physician, thoracic surgeon, and ane sthesiologist post -rehabilitation Exercise Post-rehabilitation 6 -min walk of 140 m; able to complete 3 min unloaded pedaling in exercise tolerance test (pre- and post - rehabilitation) Consent Signed consents for screening and rehabilitation Smoking Plasma cotinine level 13.7 ng/mL (or arterial carboxyhemoglobin 2.5% if using nicotine products) Nonsmoking for 4 months prior to initial interview and throughout evaluation for surgery Preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic program adherence Must complete assessment for and program of preoperative services in preparation for surgery 2. In addition, the patient must have: o Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema (as defined by radiologist assessment of upper lobe predominance on CT scan), or o Severe non -upper lobe emphysema with low exercise capacity. Patients with low exercise capacity are those whose maximal exercise capa city is at or below 25 watts for women and 40 watts (w) for men after completion of the preoperative therapeutic program in preparation for LVRS. Exercise capacity is measured by incremental, maximal, symptom- limited exercise with a cycle ergometer utiliz ing 5 or 10 watt/minute ramp on 30% oxygen after 3 minutes of unloaded pedaling. 3. Effective for services performed on or after November 17, 2005, CMS determines that LVRS is reasonable and necessary when performed at facilities that are: (1) certified b y the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (Joint Commission) under the LVRS Disease Specific Care Certification Program (program standards and requirements as printed in the Joint Commission's October 25, 2004, Disease Specific Ca re Certification Program packet); or (2) approved as Medicare lung or heart-lung transplantation hospitals. In addition, LVRS performed between January 1, 2004, and May 17, 2007, is reasonable and necessary when performed at facilities that: (1) were appro ved by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to participate in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT); or (2) are approved as Medicare lung or heart-lung transplantation hospitals. A list of approved facilities and their approval dates will be listed and maintained on the CMS Web site at www.cms.hhs.gov/coverage/lvrsfacility.pdf . The surgery must be preceded and followed by a program of diagnostic and therapeutic services consistent with those provided in the NETT and designed to maximize the patient's potential to successfully undergo and recover from surgery. The program must include a 6- to 10- week series of at least 16, and no more than 20, preoperative sessions, each lasting a minimum of 2 hours. It must also include at least 6, and no more than 10, postoperative sessions, each lasting a minimum of 2 hours, within 8 to 9 weeks of the LVRS. This program must be consistent with the care plan developed by the treating physician following performance of a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's medical, psychosocial and nutritional needs, be consistent with the preoperative and postoperative services provided in the NETT, and arranged, monitored, and performed under the coordination of the facility where the surgery takes place. C. Nationally Non- covered Indications 1. LVRS is not covered in any of the following clinical circumstances: a. Patient characteristics carry a high risk for perioperative morbidity and/or mortality; b. The disease is unsuitable for LVRS; c. Medical conditions or other circumstances make it likely that the patient will be unable to complete the preoperative and postoperative pulmonary diagnostic and therapeutic program required for surgery; d. The patient presents with FEV1 < 20% of predicted value, and either homogeneous distribution of emphysema on CT scan, or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of < 20% of predicted value (high-risk group identified October 2001 by the NETT); or e. The patient satisfies the criteria outlined above in section B(1), and has severe, non-upper lobe emphysema with high exercise capacity. High exercise capacity is defined as a maximal workload at the completion of the preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic program that is above 25 w for women and 40 w for men (under the measurement conditions for cycle ergometry specified above). 2. All other indications for LVRS not otherwise specified remain noncovered. (This NCD last reviewed November 2005.) 240.2 - Home 09 -27-21; Implementation: 01-03-23) A. General When used in the home, oxygen and oxygen equipment can make meaningful contributions to the treatment of patients with both acute and chronic conditions who require the medical gas on either a short - or long- term basis. B. Nationally Covered Indications Oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment is covered in the home for acute or chronic conditions, short- or long- term, when the patient exhibits hypoxemia as defined below. Initial claims for oxygen therapy for hypoxemic patients must be based on the results of a clinical test that has been ordered and evaluated by the treating practitioner. Such a test is usually in the form of a measurement of the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in arterial blood. A measurement of arterial oxygen saturation obtained by ear or pulse oximetry, however, is also acceptable when ordered and evaluated by the treating practitioner and performed under his or her supervision or when performed by a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory services. A durable medical equipment (DME) supplier is not considered a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory services for purposes of this National Coverage Determination (NCD). This prohibition does not extend to the results of blood gas tests conducted by a hospital certified to do such tests. When the arterial blood gas and the oximetry studies are both used to document the need for home oxygen therapy and the results are conflicting, the arterial blood gas study is the preferred source of documenting medical need. Required qualifying arte rial blood gas or oximetry studies must be performed at the time of need. The time of need is defined as during the patient's illness when the presumption is that the provision of oxygen in the home setting will improve the patient's condition. For an inpa tient hospital patient the time of need is within 2 days of discharge. For those patients whose initial oxygen prescription does not originate during an inpatient hospital stay, the time of need is during the period when the treating practitioner notes signs and symptoms of illness that can be relieved by oxygen in the patient who is to be treated at home. Patients exhibiting hypoxemia are defined using the clinical criteria below: Group I: An arterial PO2 at or below 55 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen s aturation at or below 88%, taken at rest, breathing room air; or An arterial PO2 at or below 55 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at or below 88%, taken during sleep for a patient who demonstrates an arterial PO2 at or above 56 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at or above 89%, while awake; or a greater than normal fall in oxygen level during sleep (a decrease in arterial PO2 more than 10 mm Hg, or decrease in arterial oxygen saturation more than 5%) associated with symptoms or signs reasonably attributable to hypoxemia (e.g., impairment of cognitive processes and nocturnal restlessness or insomnia). In either of these cases, coverage is provided only for use of oxygen during sleep, and then only one type of unit will be covered. Portable oxygen, therefore, would not be covered in this situation; or, An arterial PO2 at or below 55 mm Hg or an arterial oxygen saturation at or below 88%, taken during exercise [defined as either the functional performance of the patient or a formal exercise test], for a patient who demonstrates an arterial PO2 at or above 56 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at or above 89%, during the day while at rest. In this case, supplemental oxygen is provided for during exercise if the use of oxygen improves the hypoxem ia that was demonstrated during exercise when the patient was breathing room air. Group II: Coverage is available for patients whose arterial PO2 is 56 -59 mm Hg or whose arterial blood oxygen saturation is 89%, if there is: Dependent edema suggesting congestive heart failure; or, Pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale, determined by measurement of pulmonary artery pressure, gated blo od pool scan, echocardiogram, or \"P\" pulmonale on EKG (P wave greater than 3 mm in standard leads II, III, or AVFL; or, Erythrocythemia with a hematocrit greater than 56%. In reviewing the arterial PO2 levels and the arterial oxygen saturation percentages specified above, the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) must take into account variations in oxygen measurements that may result from such factors as the patient's age, the patient's skin pigmentation, the altitude level, or the patient's decrease d oxygen carrying capacity. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will not cover oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment in the home in the following circumstances: Angina pectoris in the absence of hypoxemia. Thi s condition is generally not the result of a low oxygen level in the blood, and there are other preferred treatments; or, Breathlessness without cor pulmonale or evidence of hypoxemia. Although intermittent oxygen use is sometimes prescribed to relieve this condition, it is potentially harmful and psychologically addicting; or, Severe peripheral vascular disease resulting in clinically evident desaturation in one or more extremities. There is no evidence that increased PO2 improves the oxygenation of tissues with impaired circulation; or, Terminal illnesses unless they affect the ability to breathe. D. Other The MAC may determine reasonable and necessary coverage of oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment in the home for patients who are not described in sec tion B or precluded by section C of this NCD. Initial coverage for patients with other conditions may be limited to the shorter of 90 days or the number of days included in the practitioner prescription at MAC discretion. Oxygen coverage may be renewed if deemed medically necessary by the MAC. MACs may also allow beneficiaries who are mobile in the home and would benefit from the use of a portable oxygen system in the home to qualify for coverage of a portable oxygen system either (1) by itself, or, (2) to use in addition to a stationary oxygen system. (This NCD was last reviewed July 2022.) (See \u00a7280.1 and the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Health Services,\" \u00a7110.) 240.2.1 - Home Use of Oxygen in Approved Clinical Trials (Effective March 20, 2006) (Rev. 57, Issued: 05- 26-06; Effective: 03 -20-06; Oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas that comprises 21 percent of the atmospheric gases at sea level. Historically, long term supplemental oxygen has been administered in higher than atmospheric concentrations to patie nts with chronic hypoxemia, generally resulting from cardiac and/or pulmonary disease. The need for supplemental oxygen is assessed by direct or indirect measurement of the partial pressure of oxygen (conventionally expressed in millimeters of mercury, mm Hg) and the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood (expressed as a percent). Chronic oxygen therapy is generally administered via nasal cannulae, face mask, or tracheostomy, from a stationary or portable oxygen tank or an oxygen concentrator. The medical literature documents health benefits as well as serious adverse events associated with supplemental oxygen use. In this light, it is clear that the decision to initiate, continue, or discontinue the use of supplemental oxygen should be guided by high quality scientific evidence. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for services performed on or after March 20, 2006 t he home use of oxygen is covered for those beneficiaries with arterial oxygen partial pressure measurements from 56 to 65 mmHg or oxygen saturation at or above 89% who are enrolled subjects in clinical trials approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid S ervices and sponsored by the National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI). C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications N/A D. Other This policy does not alter Medicare coverage for items and service that may be covered or non - covered according to the exi sting national coverage determination for the home use of oxygen provided outside the context of approved clinical trials (National Coverage Determination Manual, section 240.2and 310.1). (This NCD was last reviewed April 2006) 240.2.2- Home Oxygen Use to Treat Cluster Headache (CH) 27, 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services removed the national coverage determination (NCD) for home oxygen use to treat cluster headaches. In the absence of an NCD, coverage determinations will be made by the Medicare Administrative Contractors under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act, as allowed and described in Chapter 1, Section 240.2 ( Home Use of Oxygen), Subsection D, of Publication 100- 03 of the NCD Manual. 240.3 - Heat Treatment, Including the Use of Diathermy and Ultra-Sound for Pulmonary Conditions (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 35 -3 Not Covered There is no physiological rationale or valid scientific documentation of effectiveness of diathermy or ultrasound heat trea tments for asthma, bronchitis, or any other pulmonary condition and for such purpose this treatment cannot be considered reasonable and necessary within the meaning of \u00a71862(a)(1) of the Act. Cross -reference: \u00a7150.5 . 240.4 - Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Therapy For Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) (Effective April 4, 2005) (Effective March 13, 2008) (Rev. 96, Issued: 10-15- 08, Effective: 03 -13-08, Implementation: 08-04-08) A. General Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is a non-invasive technique for providing single levels of air pressure from a flow generator, via a nose mask, through the nares. The purpose is to prevent the collapse of the oropharyngeal walls and the obstruction of airflow during sleep, which occurs in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The apnea hypopnea index (AHI) is equal to the average number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour. The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) is equal to the average number of respiratory disturbances per hour. Apnea is defined as a cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds. Hypopnea is defined as an abnormal respiratory event lasting at least 10 seconds with at least a 30% reduction in thoracoabdominal movement or airflow as compared to baseline, and with at least a 4% oxygen desaturation. The AHI and/or RDI may be measured by polysomnography (PSG) in a facil ity-based sleep study laboratory, or by a Type II home sleep test (HST) monitor, a Type III HST monitor, or a Type IV HST monitor measuring at least 3 channels. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on and after Mar ch 13, 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) determines that CPAP therapy when used in adult patients with OSA is considered reasonable and necessary under the following situations: 1. The use of CPAP is covered under Medicare when used in adult patients with OSA. Coverage of CPAP is initially limited to a 12 -week period to identify beneficiaries diagnosed with OSA as subsequently described who benefit from CPAP. CPAP is subsequently covered only for those beneficiaries diagnosed with OSA who benefit from CPAP during this 12- week period. 2. The provider of CPAP must conduct education of the beneficiary prior to the use of the CPAP device to ensure that the beneficiary has been educated in the proper use of the device. A caregiver, for exampl e a family member, may be compensatory, if consistently available in the beneficiary's home and willing and able to safely operate the CPAP device. 3. A positive diagnosis of OSA for the coverage of CPAP must include a clinical evaluation and a positive: a. attended PSG performed in a sleep laboratory; or b. unattended HST with a Type II home sleep monitoring device; or c. unattended HST with a Type III home sleep monitoring device; or d. unattended HST with a Type IV home sleep monitoring device that measures at least 3 channels. 4. The sleep test must have been previously ordered by the beneficiary's treating physician and furnished under appropriate physician supervision. 5. An initial 12 -week period of CPAP is covered in adult patients with OSA if either of the following criterion using the AHI or RDI are met: a. AHI or RDI greater than or equal to 15 events per hour, or b. AHI or RDI greater than or equal to 5 events and less than or equal to 14 events per hour with documented symptoms of excessive daytim e sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood disorders or insomnia, or documented hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or history of stroke. 6. The AHI or RDI is calculated on the average number of events of per hour. If the AHI or RDI is calculated based on les s than 2 hours of continuous recorded sleep, the total number of recorded events to calculate the AHI or RDI during sleep testing must be at a minimum the number of events that would have been required in a 2- hour period. 7. Apnea is defined as a cessation o f airflow for at least 10 seconds. Hypopnea is defined as an abnormal respiratory event lasting at least 10 seconds with at least a 30% reduction in thoracoabdominal movement or airflow as compared to baseline, and with at least a 4% oxygen desaturation. 8. Coverage with Evidence Development (CED): Medicare provides the following limited coverage for CPAP in adult beneficiaries who do not qualify for CPAP coverage based on criteria 1 -7 above. A clinical study seeking Medicare payment for CPAP provided to a beneficiary who is an enrolled subject in that study must address one or more of the following questions: a. In Medicare- aged subjects with clinically identified risk factors for OSA, how does the diagnostic accuracy of a clinical trial of CPAP compare with PSG and Type II, III & IV HST in identifying subjects with OSA who will respond to CPAP? b. In Medicare- aged subjects with clinically identified risk factors for OSA who have not undergone confirmatory testing with PSG or Type II, III & IV HST, does CPAP cause clinically meaningful harm? c. The study must meet the following additional standards: d. The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a particular intervention potentially improves the participants' health outcomes. e. The rese arch study is well -supported by available scientific and medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use. f. The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing studie s. g. The research study design is appropriate to answer the research question being asked in the study. h. The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of executing the proposed study successfully. i. The research study is in complia nce with all applicable Federal regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is Food and Drug Administration -regulated, it also must be in compliance with 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56. j. All aspects of the research study are conducted according to the appropriate standards of scientific integrity. k. The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or incorporates by reference, the Medicare standards. l. The clinical research study is not designed to exc lusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or condition being studied is life -threatening as d efined in 21 CFR \u00a7312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options. m. The clinical research study is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov Web site by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject. n. The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all pre - specified outcomes to be measured, including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 24 months of the end of data collection. If a report is planned for publication in a peer -reviewed journal, then that initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. However, a full report of the outcomes must be made public no later than 3 years after the end of data collection. o. The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepre sented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria affect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations in the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are necessary. p. The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to t he Medicare population to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability, or Medicaid eligibility. C. Nationally Non -covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of services on and after March 13, 2008, other diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of OSA, other than those noted above for prescribing CPAP, are not sufficient for the coverage of CPAP. D. Other N/A (This NCD last reviewed March 2008.) 240.4.1 - Sleep Testing for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) (Effective March 3, 2009) (Rev. Effective: sleep apnea (OSA) is the collapse of the oropharyngeal walls and the obstruction of airflow occurring during sleep. Diagnostic tests for OSA have historically been classified into four types. The most comprehensive is designated Type I attend ed facility based polysomnography (PSG), which is considered the reference standard for diagnosing OSA. Attended facility based polysomnogram is a comprehensive diagnostic sleep test including at least electroencephalography (EEG), electro -oculography (EO breathing/respiratory effort, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) furnished in a sleep laboratory facility in which a technologist supervises the recording during sleep time and has the ability to intervene if needed. Overnight PSG is the conventional diagnostic test for OSA. The American Thoracic Society and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine have recommended supervised PSG in the sleep laboratory over 2 nights for the di agnosis of OSA and the initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Three categories of portable monitors (used both in attended and unattended settings) have been developed for the diagnosis of OSA. Type II monitors have a minimum of 7 channels (e.g., EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG -heart rate, airflow, breathing/respiratory effort, SaO 2)-this type of device monitors sleep staging, so AHI can be calculated). Type III monitors have a minimum of 4 monitored channels including ventilation or airflow (at le ast two channels of respiratory movement or respiratory movement and airflow), heart rate or ECG, and oxygen saturation. Type IV devices may measure one, two, three or more parameters but do not meet all the criteria of a higher category device. Some moni tors use an actigraphy algorithm to identify periods of sleep and wakefulness. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on and after March 3, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services finds that the evidence is sufficient to determine that the results of the sleep tests identified below can be used by a beneficiary's treating physician to diagnose OSA, that the use of such sleep testing technologies demonstrates improved health outcomes in Medicare beneficiari es who have OSA and receive the appropriate treatment, and that these tests are thus reasonable and necessary under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act. 1. Type I PSG is covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in beneficiaries who have clinical signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed attended in a sleep lab facility. 2. Type II or Type III sleep testing devices are covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in beneficiaries who have clinical signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed unattended in or out of a sleep lab facility or attended in a sleep lab facility. 3. Type IV sleep testing devices measuring three or more channels, one of which is airflow, are covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in beneficiar ies who have signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed unattended in or out of a sleep lab facility or attended in a sleep lab facility. 4. Sleep testing devices measuring three or more channels that include actigraphy, oximetry, and peripheral ar terial tone, are covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in beneficiaries who have signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed unattended in or out of a sleep lab facility or attended in a sleep lab facility. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indicati ons Effective for claims with dates of services on and after March 3, 2009, other diagnostic sleep tests for the diagnosis of OSA, other than those noted above for prescribing CPAP, are not sufficient for the coverage of CPAP and are not covered. D. Other N/A (This NCD last reviewed March 2009.) 240.5 - Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilator (IPV) (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 60 -21 Not Covered IPV is a mechanized form of chest physical therapy. Instead of a therapist clapping or slapping the patient's chest wall, the IPV delivers mini-bursts (more than 200 per minute) of respiratory gasses to the lungs via a mouthpiece. Its intended purpose is to mobilize endobronchial secretions and diffuse patchy atelectasis. The patient controls variables such as inspiratory time, peak pressure and delivery rates. Studies do not demonstrate any advantage of IPV over that achieved with good pulmonary care in the hospital environment and there are no studies in the home setting. There are no data to support the effectiveness of the device. Therefore, IPV in the home setting is not covered. 240.6- Transverse Pulmonary Effective October 28, 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services removed the national coverage determination (NCD) for Transvenous (Catheter) Pulmonary Embolectomy (TPE). In the absence of an NCD, coverage determinations will be made by the Medicare Administrative Contractors under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act. 240.7 - Postural Drainage Procedures and Pulmonary Exercises (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 35 -15 In most cases, postural drainage procedures and pulmonary exercises can be carried out safely and effectively by nursing personnel. However, in some cases patients may have acute or severe pulmonary conditions involving complex situations in which these procedures or exercises require the knowledge and skills of a physical therapist or a respiratory therapist. Therefore, if the attending physician determines as part of his/her plan of treatment that for the safe and effective administration of such services the procedures or exercises in question need to be performed by a physical therapist, the services of such a therapist constitute covered physical therapy when provided as an inpatient hospital service, extended care service, home health service, or outpatient physical therapy service. NOTE: Physical therapy furnished in the outpatient department of a hospital is covered under the outpatient physical therapy benefit. If the attending physician determines that the services should be performed by a respiratory therapist, the services of such a therapist constitute covered respiratory therapy when provided as an inpatient hospital service, outpatient hospital service, or extended care service, assuming that such services are furnished to the skilled nursing facility by a hospital with which the facility has a transfer agreement. Since the services of a respiratory therapist are not covered under the home health benefit, payment may not be made under the home health benefit for visits by a respiratory therapist to a patient's home to provide such services. Postural drainage procedures and pulmonary exercises are also covered when furnished by a physical therapist or a respiratory therapist as incident to a physician's professional service.

General Pulmonary rehabilitation was defined in a 1999 joint statement of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society as a multi -disciplinary program of care for patients with chronic respiratory impairment that is individually tailored and designed to optimize physical and social performance and autonomy and an evidence- based, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive intervention for patients with chronic respiratory diseases who are symptomatic and often have decreased daily life activities. Integrated into the individualized treatment of the patient, pulmonary rehabilitation is designed to reduce symptoms, optimize functional status, increase participation, and reduce health care costs through stabilizing or reversing systematic manifestations of the disease. Although services that make up pulmonary rehabilitat ion individually may be covered under Medicare and fall into various applicable benefit categories, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that the Social Security Act (the Act) does not expressly define a comprehensive Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program as a Part B benefit. In addition, respiratory therapy services are identified as covered services under the Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility benefit and defined in 42 CFR 410.100(e)(1) to (2)(vi). B. Nationally Covered Indications N/A C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications N/A D. Other The CMS has determined that a national coverage determination (NCD) for pulmonary rehabilitation is not appropriate at this time. A/B MACs (A) and (B) should continue to make decisions under \u00a71862(a)(1)(A) of the Act through their local coverage determination (LCD) process or by case-by- case adjudication. See Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 617 (1984) (Recognizing that the Secretary has discretion to either establish a generally applicable rule or to allow individual adjudication.). See also, 68 Fed. Reg. 63692, 63693 (November 7, 2003). LCDs can be accessed from the CMS search engine located at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/mcd/se arch.asp . 250 - Skin (Rev. 1, Treatment of Psoriasis (Rev. 173, Effective: Upon Implementation: -10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease, for which several conventional methods of treatment have been recognized as covered. These include topical application of steroids or other drugs; ultraviolet light (actinotherapy); and coal tar alone or in combination with ultraviol et B light (Goeckerman treatment). A newer treatment for psoriasis uses a psoralen derivative drug in combination with ultraviolet A light, known as PUVA. PUVA therapy is covered for treatment of intractable, disabling psoriasis, but only after the psoriasis has not responded to more conventional treatment. The A/B MAC (A) or (B) should document this before paying for PUVA therapy. In addition, reimbursement for PUVA therapy should be limited to amounts paid for other types of photochemotherapy; ordinarily, payment should not be allowed for more than 30 days of treatment, unless improvement is documented. 250.2 - Hemorheograph (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 50 -16 The hemorheograph is a diagnostic instrument which is safe and effective for determining the adequ acy of skin perfusion prior to the performance of minor surgical procedures on the extremities, including minor podiatric procedures, and as an adjunct to the evaluation of patients suspected of having peripheral vascular disease. Program payment may be m ade only for those services employing the hemorheograph which are performed for preoperative and postoperative diagnostic evaluation of suspected peripheral artery disease. NOTE: This instrument is not a plethysmograph and is not considered as such. A plethysmograph measures and records changes in the size of a body part as modified by the circulation of blood in that part. The hemorheograph, on the other hand, measures surface blood flow in the skin; it does not measure total blood flow in a digit or li mb. 250.3 - Intravenous Immune Globulin for the Treatment of Autoimmune Mucocutaneous Blistering Diseases (Rev. 173, ICD -10) Intravenous immune globulin ( IVIg) is a blood product prepared from the pooled plasma of donors. It has been used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases, including mucocutaneous blistering diseases. It has fewer side effects than steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Effective October 1, 2002, IVIg is covered for the treatment of biopsy- Bullosa Acquisita for the following patient subpopulations: Patients who have failed conventional therapy. A/B MACs (A) and (B) have the discretion to define what constitutes failure of conventional therapy; Patients in whom conventional therapy is otherwise contraindicated. conventional therapy; or Patients with rapidly progressive disease in whom a clinical response could not be affected quickly enough using conventional agents. In such situations IVIg therapy would be given along with conventional treatm ent(s) and the IVIg would be used only until the conventional therapy could take effect. In addition, IVIg for the treatment of autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering diseases must be used only for short -term therapy and not as a maintenance therapy. A/B MA Cs (A) and (B) have the discretion to decide what constitutes short -term therapy. 250.4 - Treatment of Actinic Keratosis (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 35 -101 Actinic keratoses (AKs), also known as solar keratoses, are common, sun- induced skin lesions that are confined to the epidermis and have the potential to become a skin cancer. Various options exist for treating AKs. Clinicians should select an appropriate treatment based on the patient's medical history, the lesion's characteristics, and on the patient's preference for a specific treatment. Commonly performed treatments for AKs include cryosurgery with liquid nitrogen, topical drug therapy, and curettage. Less commonly performed treatments for AK include dermabrasion, excision, chemical peels, laser ther apy, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). An alternative approach to treating AKs is to observe the lesions over time and remove them only if they exhibit specific clinical features suggesting possible transformation to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Effective for services performed on and after November 26, 2001, Medicare covers the destruction of actinic keratoses without restrictions based on lesion or patient characteristics. 250.5 - Dermal Injections for the Treatment of Facial Lipodystrophy Syndrome (LDS) - Effective March 23, 2010 of persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or persons who have Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) may include highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Drug reactions commonly associated with long- term use of HAART include metabolic complications such as, lipid abnormalities, e.g., hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes , lipodystrophy, and heart disease. Lipodystrophy is characterized by abnormal fat distribution in the body. The LDS is often characterized by a loss of fat that results in a facial abnormality such as severely sunken cheeks. The patient's physical appearance may contribute to psychological conditions (e.g., depression) or adversely impact a patient's adherence to antiretroviral regimens (therefore jeopardizing their health) and both of these are important health- related outcomes of interest in this population. Therefore, improving a patient's physical appearance through the use of dermal injections could improve these health -related outcomes. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for claims with dates of service on and after March 23, 2010, dermal injections for LDS are only reasonable and necessary using dermal fillers approved by the Food and Drug Admi nistration (FDA) for this purpose, and then only in HIV -infected beneficiaries when LDS caused by antiretroviral HIV treatment is a significant contributor to their depression. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications 1. Dermal fillers that are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of LDS. 2. Dermal fillers that are used for any indication other than LDS in HIV -infected individuals who manifest depression as a result of their antiretroviral HIV treatments. D. Other N/A (This NCD last reviewed March 2 010.) 260 - Transplantation - Solid Organ Transplants (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) 260.1 - Adult Liver Transplantation 06 -21-12, Implementation; 09- 04-12) A. General Liver transplantation, which is in situ replacement of a patient's liver with a donor liver, in certain circumstances, may be an accepted treatment for patients with end -stage liver disease due to a variety of causes. The procedure is used in selected pat ients as a treatment for malignancies, including primary liver tumors and certain metastatic tumors, which are typically rare but lethal with very limited treatment options. It has also been used in the treatment of patients with extrahepatic perihilar ma lignancies. Examples of malignancies include (CCA), liver due to a neuroendocrine tumor (NET), and, hemangioendothelioma (HAE). Despite potential short - and long- term complications, transplantation may offer the only chance of cure for selected patients while providing meaningful palliation for some others. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective July 15, 1996, adult liver transplantation when performed on beneficiaries with end- stage liver disease other than hepatitis B or malignancies is covered under Medicare when performed in a facility which is approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as meeting institutional coverage criteria. Effective December 10, 1999, adult liver transplantation when performed on beneficiaries with end-stage liver disease other than malignancies is covered under Medicare when performed in a facility which is approved by CMS as meeting institutional coverage criteria. Effective September 1, 2001, Medicare covers adult liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma when the following conditions are met: The patient is not a candidate for subtotal liver resection; The patient's tumor(s) is less than or equal to 5 cm in diameter; There is no macrovascular involvement; There is no identifiable extrahepatic spread of tumor to surrounding lymph nodes, lungs, abdominal organs or bone; and, The transplant is furnished in a facility that is approved by CMS as meeting institutional coverage cri teria for liver transplants (see 65 FR 15006). Effective June 21, 2012, A/B MACs (A) and (B) acting within their respective jurisdictions may determine coverage of adult liver transplantation for the following malignancies: (1) extrahepatic unresectable cholangiocarcinoma (CCA); (2) liver tumor (NET); and, (3) hemangioendothelioma (HAE). 1. Follow -Up Care Follow -up care or re -transplantation required as a result of a covered liver transplant is covered, provided such s ervices are otherwise reasonable and necessary. Follow -up care is also covered for patients who have been discharged from a hospital after receiving non- covered liver transplant. Coverage for follow -up care is for items and services that are reasonable an d necessary as determined by Medicare guidelines. 2. Immunosuppressive Drugs See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Health Services,\" \u00a750.5.1 and the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 17, \"Drugs and Biolo gicals,\" \u00a780.3. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications Adult liver transplantation for other malignancies remains excluded from coverage. D. Other Coverage of adult liver transplantation is effective as of the date of the facility's approval, but for applications received before July 13, 1991, can be effective as early as March 8, 1990. (See 56 FR 15006 dated April 12, 1991.) (This NCD last reviewed June 2012.) 260.2 - Pediatric Liver Transplantation (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 35 -53.1 Liver transplantation is covered for children (under age 18) with extrahepatic biliary atresia or any other form of end stage liver disease, except that coverage is not provided for children with a malignancy extending beyond the margins of the liver or those wi th persistent viremia. Liver transplantation is covered for Medicare beneficiaries when performed in a pediatric hospital that performs pediatric liver transplants if the hospital submits an application which CMS approves documenting that: The hospital's pediatric liver transplant program is operated jointly by the hospital and another facility that has been found by CMS to meet the institutional coverage criteria in the \"Federal Register\" notice of April 12, 1991; The unified program shares the same transplant surgeons and quality assurance program (including oversight committee, patient protocol, and patient selection criteria); and The hospital is able to provide the specialized facilities, services, and personnel that are required by pediatric liver transplant patients. 260.3 - Pancreas Transplants (Effective April 26, 2006) (Rev. transplantation is performed to induce an insulin-independent, euglycemic state in diabetic patients. The procedure is generally limited to those patients with severe secondary complications of diabetes, including kidney failure. However, pancre as transplantation is sometimes performed on patients with labile diabetes and hypoglycemic unawareness. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for services performed on or after July 1, 1999, whole organ pancreas transplantation is nationally covered by Medicare when performed simultaneous with or after a kidney transplant. If the pancreas transplant occurs after the kidney transplant, immunosuppressive therapy begins with the date of discharge from the inpatient stay for the pancreas transplant. Effective for services performed on or after April 26, 2006, pancreas transplants alone (PA) are reasonable and necessary for Medicare beneficiaries in the following limited circumstances: 1. PA will be limited to those facilities that are Medicare -approved for kidney transplantation. (Approved centers can be found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ESRDGeneralInformation/02_Data.asp#TopOfPage .) 2. Patients must have a diagnosis of type I diabetes: Patient with diabetes must be beta cell autoantibody positive; or o Patient must demonstra te insulinopenia defined as a fasting C- peptide level that is less than or equal to 110% of the lower limit of normal of the laboratory's measurement method. Fasting C-peptide levels will only be considered valid with a concurrently obtained fasting glucose <225 mg/dL. 3. Patients must have a history of medically -uncontrollable labile (brittle) insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus with documented recurrent, severe, acutely life-threatening metabolic complications that require hospitalization. Aforementioned complications include frequent hypoglycemia unawareness or recurring severe ketoacidosis, or recurring severe hypoglycemic attacks; 4. Patients must have been optimally and intensively managed by an endocrinologist for at least 12 months with the most medically -recognized advanced insulin formulations and delivery systems; 5. Patients must have the emotional and mental capacity to understand the significant risks associated with surgery and to effectively manage the lifelong need for immunosuppression; and, 6. Patients must otherwise be a suitable candidate for transplantation. C. Nationally Non- Covered Indications The following procedure is not considered reasonable and necessary within the meaning of section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act: 1. Transplantation of partial pancreatic tissue or islet cells (except in the context of a clinical trial (see section 260.3.1 of the National Coverage Determinations Manual). D. Other Not applicable. (This NCD last reviewed April 2006.) 260.3.1 - Islet Cell Transplantation in the Context of A Clinical Trial (Effective October 1, 2004) (Rev. 18, Issued 07-30- 04, Effective: 10 -01-04, Implementation: 10-04-04) A. General As a result of section 733 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108- 173), The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, acting through the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disorders, shall conduct a clinical investigation of pancreat ic islet cell transplantation that includes Medicare beneficiaries. The transplant is performed on patients with Type I diabetes. A typical islet cell transplant requires over 500,000 islet cells, but varies depending on the recipient's weight. One of t he desired patient outcomes is insulin independence. Elimination of clinically significant hypoglycemia episodes and improved glucose control are other important patient outcomes One or more pancreata are obtained from donor(s). The islets must be removed within hours after the recovery of the donor pancreas to ensure viability. The islet cells are transplanted by injection into the portal vein of the recipient either using direct visualization, guided ultrasound or percutaneously. The islet cell trans plant may be performed alone, in combination with a kidney transplant, or after a kidney transplant. Islet recipients require immunosuppressant therapy to prevent rejection of the transplanted islet cells. Routine follow -up care is necessary for each tri al participant. B. Nationally Covered Indications Medicare will pay for the routine costs, as well as transplantation and appropriate related items and services, for Medicare beneficiaries participating in a National Institutes of Health (NIH) - sponsored clinical trial(s). The term `routine costs' means reasonable and necessary routine patient care costs, including immunosuppressive drugs and other follow -up care, as defined in section 310.1 of the NCD Manual. Specifically, Medicare will cover transplan tation of pancreatic islet cells, the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. Coverage will include the costs of acquisition and delivery of the pancreatic islet cells, as well as clinically necessary inpatient and outpatient medical care and immunosuppr essants. C. Nationally Noncovered Indications Partial pancreatic tissue transplantation or islet cell transplantation performed outside the context of a clinical trial continues to be noncovered. D. Other Not applicable. (This NCD last reviewed July 2004.) 260.4 - Reserved (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) 260.5 - Intestinal and Multi- Visceral Transplantation (Effective May covers intestinal and multi -visceral transplantation for the purpose of restoring intestinal function in patients with irreversible intestinal failure. Intestinal failure is defined as the loss of absorptive capacity of the small bowel secondary to severe primary gastrointestinal disease or surgically induced short bowel syndrome. It may be associated with both mortality and profound morbidity. Multi- visceral transplantation includes organs in the digestive system (stomach, duodenum, pancreas, liver and intestine). The evidence supports the fact that aged patients generally do not survive as well as younger patients receiving intestinal transplantation. Nonetheless, some older patients who are free from other contraindications have received the procedure and are progres sing well, as evidenced by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data. Thus, it is not appropriate to include specific exclusions from coverage, such as an age limitation, in the national coverage policy. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for services performed on or after April 1, 2001, this procedure is covered only when performed for patients who have failed total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and only when performed in centers that meet approval criteria. 1. Failed TPN The TPN delivers nutrients intravenously, avoiding the need for absorption through the small bowel. TPN failure includes the following: Impending or overt liver failure due to TPN induced liver injury. The clinical manifestations include ele vated and femoral veins. Th rombosis of two or more of these vessels is considered a life threatening complication and failure of TPN therapy. The sequelae of central venous thrombosis are lack of access for TPN infusion, fatal sepsis due to infected thrombi, pulmonary embolism, Superior Vena Cava syndrome, or chronic venous insufficiency. Frequent line infection and sepsis. The development of two or more episodes of systemic sepsis secondary to line infection per year that requires hospitalization indicates failure of TPN therapy. A single episode of line related fungemia, septic shock and/or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome are considered indicators of TPN failure. Frequent episodes of severe dehydration despite intravenous fluid supplement in addition to TPN. Under certain medical conditions such as secretory diarrhea and non-constructable gastrointestinal tract, the loss of the gastrointestinal and pancreatobiliary secretions exceeds the maximum intravenous infusion rates that can be tolerated by the cardiopulmonary system. Frequent episodes of dehydration are deleterious to all body organs particularly kidneys and the central nervous system with the development of multiple kidney stones, renal failure, and permanent brain damage. 2. Approved Transplant Facilities Intestinal transplantation is covered by Medicare if performed in an approved facility. The criteria for approval of centers will be based on a volume of 10 intestinal transplants per year with a 1 -year actuarial survival of 65 percent using t he Kaplan -Meier technique. C. Nationally Non- covered Indications All other indications remain non-covered. D. Other NA. (This NCD last reviewed May 2006.) 260.6 - Dental Examination Prior to Kidney Transplantation (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 50 -26 Despite the \"dental services exclusion\" in \u00a71862(a)(12) of the Act (see the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 16, \"General Exclusions From Coverage,\" \u00a7140;), an oral or dental examination performed on an inpatient basis as part of a comprehensive workup prior to renal transplant surgery is a covered service. This is because the purpose of the examination is not for the care of the teeth or structures directly supporting the teeth. Rather, the examination is for the identification, prior to a complex surgical procedure, of existing medical problems where the increased possibility of infection would not only reduce the chances for successful surgery but would also expose the patient to additional risks in undergoing such surgery. Such a dental or oral examination would be covered under Part A of the program if performed by a dentist on the hospital's staff, or under Part B if performed by a physician. (When performing a dental or oral examination, a dentist is not recognized as a physician under \u00a71861(r) of the Act.) (See the Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual, Chapter 5, \"Definitions,\" \u00a770.2, and the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Health Services,\" \u00a7150.) 260.7 - Lymphocyte Immune Globulin, Anti -Thymocyte Globulin (Equine) (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 45 -22 The lymphocyte immune globulin preparations are biologic drugs not previously approved or licensed for use in the management of renal allograft rejection. A number of other lymphocyte immune globulin products of equine, lapine, and murine origin are currently under investigation for their potential usefulness in controlling allograft rejections in human transplantation. These biologic drugs are viewed as adjunctive to traditional immunosuppressive products such as steroids and anti -metabolic drugs. At pr esent, lymphocyte immune globulin preparations are not recommended to replace conventional immunosuppressive drugs, but to supplement them and to be used as alternatives to elevated or accelerated dosing with conventional immunosuppressive agents. The FDA has approved one lymphocyte immune globulin preparation for marketing, lymphocyte immune globulin, anti -thymocyte globulin (equine). This drug is indicated for the management of allograft rejection episodes in renal transplantation. It is covered under Medicare when used for this purpose. Other forms of lymphocyte globulin preparation which the FDA approves for this indication in the future may be covered under Medicare. 260.8 - Reserved (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) Reserved 260.9 - Heart Transplants (Rev. 05 -01-08; Implementation Date: 12 -01-08) A. General Cardiac transplantation is covered under Medicare when performed in a facility which is approved by Medicare as meeting institutional coverage criteria. (See CMS Rul ing 87- 1.) B. Exceptions In certain limited cases, exceptions to the criteria may be warranted if there is justification and if the facility ensures our objectives of safety and efficacy. Under no circumstances will exceptions be made for facilities wh ose transplant programs have been in existence for less than 2 years, and applications from consortia will not be approved. Although consortium arrangements will not be approved for payment of Medicare heart transplants, consideration will be given to applications from heart transplant facilities that consist of more than one hospital where all of the following conditions exist: The hospitals are under the common control or have a formal affiliation arrangement with each other under the auspices of an org anization such as a university or a legally constituted medical research institute; and The hospitals share resources by routinely using the same personnel or services in their transplant programs. The sharing of resources must be supported by the submission of operative notes or other information that documents the routine use of the same p ersonnel and services in all of the individual hospitals. At a minimum, shared resources means: The individual members of the transplant team, consisting of the cardiac transplant surgeons, cardiologists and pathologists, must practice in all the hospita ls and it can be documented that they otherwise function as members of the transplant team; and The same organ procurement organization, immunology, and tissue -typing services must be used by all the hospitals; The hospitals submit, in the manner requir ed (Kaplan -Meier method) their individual and pooled experience and survival data; and The hospitals otherwise meet the remaining Medicare criteria for heart transplant facilities; that is, the criteria regarding patient selection, patient management, pr ogram commitment, etc. C. Pediatric Hospitals Cardiac transplantation is covered for Medicare beneficiaries when performed in a pediatric hospital that performs pediatric heart transplants if the hospital submits an application which CMS approves as doc umenting that: The hospital's pediatric heart transplant program is operated jointly by the hospital and another facility that has been found by CMS to meet the institutional coverage criteria in CMS Ruling 87- 1; The unified program shares the same trans plant surgeons and quality assurance program (including oversight committee, patient protocol, and patient selection criteria); and The hospital is able to provide the specialized facilities, services, and personnel that are required by pediatric heart t ransplant patients. D. Follow -Up Care Follow -up care required as a result of a covered heart transplant is covered, provided such services are otherwise reasonable and necessary. Follow -up care is also covered for patients who have been discharged from a hospital after receiving a noncovered heart transplant. Coverage for follow -up care would be for items and services that are reasonable and necessary, as determined by Medicare guidelines. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 16, \"General Exclusions From Coverage,\" \u00a7180.) E. Immunosuppressive Drugs See the Medicare Claims Processing Manuals, Chapter 17, \"Drugs and Biologicals,\" \u00a7\u00a780.3.1 and, Chapter 8, \"Outpatient ESRD Hospital, Independent Facility, and Physician/Supplier Claims,\" \u00a7120.1. F. Artificial Hearts Medicare covers ventricular assist devices (V AD) and artificial hearts when implanted under the coverage criteria stated in \u00a720.9 of this manual (NCD Manual 100- 03). (This NCD last reviewed April 2008.) 260.10 - Heartsbreath Test for Heart Transplant Rejection (Effective December 8, 2008) Issued: 02 -13-09, The Heartsbreath test is a Food and Drug Administration- approved Humanitarian Use Device for use only as an adjunct to the endomyocardial biopsy to detect grade 3 heart transplant rejection in patients who have had a heart transplant within the last year and an endomyocardial biopsy within the prior month. The test involves collecting breath samples from the patient and analysis of the samples performed in a laboratory. These te st results are then compared to endomyocardial biopsy findings and the results are provided to the clinician shortly thereafter. B. Nationally Covered Indications N/A C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications Effective for services performed on or after De cember 8, 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has determined that the evidence does not adequately define the technical characteristics of the test nor demonstrate that Heartsbreath testing to predict heart transplant rejection improves heal th outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries. Thus, we conclude that the Heartsbreath test is not reasonable and necessary under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act and is non- covered. D. Other N/A (This NCD last reviewed December 2008.) 270 - Wound Treatment (Rev 7, 03- 19-04) 270.1 - Electrical Stimulation (ES) and Electromagnetic Therapy for the Treatment of Wounds - (Effective July 1, 2004) (Rev. 173, Issued: 09- 04-14, entation of ICD -10) Electrical stimulation (ES) and electromagnetic therapy have been used or studied for many different applications, one of which is accelerating wound healing. ES for the treatment of wounds is the application of electrical current thr ough electrodes placed directly on the skin in close proximity to the wound. Electromagnetic therapy uses a pulsed magnetic field to induce current. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) was asked to reconsider its national non- coverage determination for electromagnetic therapy. After thorough review, CMS determined that the results from the use of electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of wounds were similar to the results from the use of ES. Therefore, effective July 1, 2004, Medicare will cover electromagnetic therapy for the same settings and conditions for which ES is covered. This means Medicare will allow either one covered ES therapy or one covered electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of wounds. A. Nationally Covered Indic ations The use of ES and electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of wounds are considered adjunctive therapies, and will only be covered for chronic Stage III or Stage IV pressure ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. Chro nic ulcers are defined as ulcers that have not healed within 30 days of occurrence. ES or electromagnetic therapy will be covered only after appropriate standard wound therapy has been tried for at least 30 days and there are no measurable signs of improved healing. This 30- day period may begin while the wound is acute. Standard wound care includes: optimization of nutritional status, debridement by any means to remove devitalized tissue, maintenance of a clean, moist bed of granulation tissue with appropriate moist dressings, and necessary treatment to resolve any infection that may be present. Sta ndard wound care based on the specific type of wound includes: frequent repositioning of a patient with pressure ulcers (usually every 2 hours), off -loading of pressure and good glucose control for diabetic ulcers, establishment of adequate circulation for arterial ulcers, and the use of a compression system for patients with venous ulcers. Measurable signs of improved healing include: a decrease in wound size (either surface area or volume), decrease in amount of exudates, and decrease in amount of necrot ic tissue. ES or electromagnetic therapy must be discontinued when the wound demonstrates 100% epithelialized wound bed. The ES and electromagnetic therapy services can only be covered when performed by a physician, physical therapist, or incident to a physician service. Evaluation of the wound is an integral part of wound therapy. When a physician, physical therapist, or a clinician incident to a physician, performs ES or electromagnetic therapy, the practitioner must evaluate the wound and contact the treating physician if the wound worsens. If ES or electromagnetic therapy is being used, wounds must be evaluated at least monthly by the treating physician. B. Nationally Non -Covered Indications 1. ES and electromagnetic therapy will not be covered as an initial treatment modality. 2. Continued treatment with ES or electromagnetic therapy is not covered if measurable signs of healing have not been demonstrated within any 30-day period of treatment. 3. Unsupervised use of ES or electromagnetic therapy for wound therapy will not be covered, as this use has not been found to be medically reasonable and necessary. C. Other All other uses of ES and electromagnetic therapy not otherwise specified for the treatment of wounds remain at local Medicare Administrative Contractor discretion. 270.2 - Noncontact Normothermic Wound Therapy (NNWT) (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 60 -25 The NNWT is a device reported to promote wound healing by warming a wound to a predetermined temperature. The device consists of a noncontact wound cover into which a flexible, battery powered, infrared heating card is inserted. There is insufficient sci entific or clinical evidence to consider this device as reasonable and necessary for the treatment of wounds within the meaning of \u00a71862(a)(1)(A) of the Act and will not be covered by Medicare. 270.3 - Blood -Derived Products for Chronic Effective:04-13-21, Implementation: 01-03-22 Shared Systems Contractors, 02-14- 22 MACs) A. General Wound healing is a dynamic, interactive process that involves multiple cells and proteins. There are three progressive stages of normal wound healing, and the typical wound healing duration is about 4 weeks. While cutaneous wounds are a disruption of the normal, anatomic structure and function of the skin, subcutaneous wounds involve tissue below the skin's surface. Wounds are categorized as either acute, where the normal wound healing stages are not yet completed but it is presumed they will be, resulting in orderly and timely wound repair, or chronic, where a wound has failed to progress through the normal wound healing stages and repair itself within a sufficient time period. Platelet -rich plasma (PRP) is produced in an autologous or homologous manner. Autologous PRP is comprised of blood from the patient who will ultimately receive the PRP. Alternatively, homologous PRP is derived from blood from multiple donors. Blood is donated by the patient and centrifuged to produce an autologous gel for treatment of chronic, non-healing cutaneous wounds that persist for 30 days or longer and fail to properly complete the healing process. Autologous blood derived products for chronic, non-healing wounds includes both: (1) platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) products, and (2) PRP (such as AutoloGel). The PRP is different from previous products in that it contains whole cells including white cells, red cells, plasma, platelets, fibrin, stem cells, and fibrocyte precursors. The PRP is used by physicians in clinical settings in treating chronic, non-healing wounds, open, cutaneous wounds, soft tissue and bone. Alternatively, PDGF does not contain cells and was previously marketed as a product to be used by patients at home. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for services performed on or after April 13, 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will cover autologous PRP for the treatment of chronic non-healing diabetic wounds under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) for a duration of 20 weeks, when prepared by devices whose Food and Drug Administration- cleared indications include the management of exuding cutaneous wounds, such as diabetic ulcers. C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications Autologous PDGF for the treatment of chronic, non-healing cutaneous wounds, and, Becaplermin, a non -autologous growth factor for chronic, non-healing subcutaneous wounds, and, Autologous PRP for the treatment of acute surgical wounds when the autologous PRP is applied directly to the closed incision, or for dehiscent wounds. D. Other Effective for services performed on or after April 13, 2021: Coverage of autologous PRP for the treatment of chronic non-healing diabetic wounds beyond 20 weeks will be determined by the local Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs). Coverage of autologous PRP for the treatment of all other chronic non-healing wounds will be determined by the local MACs under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act. (This NCD last reviewed April 2021.) 270.4 - Treat ment of Decubitus Ulcers (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 35 -31 An accepted procedure for healing decubitus ulcers is to remove dead tissue from the lesions and to keep them clean to promote the growth of new tissue. This may be accomplished by hydrotherapy (whirlpool) treatments. Hydrotherapy (whirlpool) treatment for decubitus ulcers is a covered service under Medicare for patients when treatment is reasonable and necessary. Some other methods of treating decubitus ulcers, the safety and effectiveness of which have not been established, are not covered under the Medicare program. Some examples of these types of treatments are: ultraviolet light, low intensity direct current, topical application of oxygen, and topical dressings with Balsam of Peru in castor oil. 270.5 - Porcine Skin and Gradient Pressure Dressings (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 45 -12 Porcine (pig) skin dressings are covered, if reasonable and necessary for the individual patient as an occlusive dressing for burns, donor sites of a homograft, and decubiti and other ulcers. Gradient pressure dressings are Jobst elasticized heavy duty dressings used to reduce hypertrophic scarring and joint contractures following burn injury. They are covered when used for that purpose. 270.6 - Infrared Therapy Devices (Effective October 24, 2006) (Rev. 62, Issued: 12- 15-06, Effective: 10 -24-06, Implementation: 01- 16-07) A. General Infrared therapy devices are used to treat an area of the skin and adjacent subcutaneous tissues of a patient with infrared therapy energy, using an array of juxtaposed infrared diodes affixed to a flexible pad to retain skin contact. The devices can also produce local warming, though this may be a secondary effect. The use of infrared therapy devices has been proposed for a variety of disorders; including treatment of diabetic neuropathy, other peripheral neuropathy, skin ulcers and wounds, and similar related conditions, including conditions such as pain arising form these conditions. A wide variety of devices are currently available. B. Nationally Covered Indications N/A C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications Effective for services performed on and after October 24, 2006, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has determined that there is sufficient evidence to conclude the use of infrared therapy devices a nd any related accessories is not reasonable and necessary under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act). The use of infrared and/or near -infrared light and/or heat, including monochromatic infrared energy, is non- covered for the treatm ent, including the symptoms such as pain arising form these conditions, of diabetic and/or non-diabetic peripheral sensory neuropathy, wounds and/or ulcers of the skin and/or subcutaneous tissues. D. Other N/A (This NCD was last reviewed November 2006) 280 - Medical and Surgical Supplies (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) 280.1 - Durable Medical Equipment Reference List (Effective May 2005) (Rev. 12183, Issued: 08-03-23, Effective: 05-16-23, Implementation:09- 04-23) The durable medical equipment (DME) list that follows is designed to facilitate the A/B MAC (HHH) and DME MACs processing of DME claims. This section is designed as a quick reference tool for determining the coverage status of certain pieces of DME and es pecially for those items commonly referred to by both brand and generic names. The information contained herein is applicable (where appropriate) to all DME national coverage determinations (NCDs) discussed in the DME portion of this manual. The list is organized into two columns. The first column lists alphabetically various generic categories of equipment on which NCDs have been made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); the second column notes the coverage status. In the case of equ ipment categories that have been determined by CMS to be covered under the DME benefit, the list outlines the conditions of coverage that must be met if payment is to be allowed for the rental or purchase of the DME by a particular patient, or cross -refers to another section of the manual where the applicable coverage criteria are described in more detail. With respect to equipment categories that cannot be covered as DME, the list includes a brief explanation of why the equipment is not covered. This DME list will be updated periodically to reflect any additional NCDs that CMS may make with regard to other categories of equipment. When the A/B MAC (HHH) or DME MAC receives a claim for an item of equipment which does not appear to fall logically into any of the generic categories listed or has not been addressed in the processes outlined in regulations at 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7414.114 and 414.240 , the A/B MAC (HHH) or DME MAC has the authority and responsibility for deciding whether those items are covered under the DME benefit. These decisions must be made by each A/B MAC (HHH) and DME MAC based on the advice of its medical consultants, taking i nto account: The Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 20, \"Durable Medical Equipment Prosthetics and Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS).\" Whether the item has been approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is otherwise generally considered to be safe and effective for the purpose intended; and Whether the item is reasonable and necessary for the individual patient. The term DME is defined as equipment which, according to 42 CFR \u00a7414.202 : Can withstand repeated use; i.e., could normally be rented and used by successive patients; Effective with respect to items classified as DME after January 1, 2012, has an expected life of at least 3 years; Is primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose; Generally, is not useful to a person in the absence of illness or injury; and, Is appropriate for use in a patient's home.

(Not considered Mobility Assistive Equipment) Cross -references: Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapters 13, \"Rural Health Clinic (RHC) and Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Serv ices,\" 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Health Services.\" Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapters 12, \"Physician/Practitioner Billing,\" 20, \"Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics and Orthotics, and 23, \"Fee Schedule Administration a nd Coding Requirements.\" 280.2 - White Cane for Use by a Blind Person (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 60 -3 Not Covered A white cane for use by a blind person is more an identifying and self -help device than an item which makes a meaningful contribution in the treatment of an illness or injury. 280.3 - Mobility Assistive Equipment (MAE) (Effective May 5, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Servi ces (CMS) addresses numerous items that it terms \"mobility assistive equipment\" (MAE) and includes within that category canes, crutches, walkers, manual wheelchairs, power wheelchairs, and scooters. This list, however, is not exhaustive. Medicare beneficiaries may require mobility assistance for a variety of reasons and for varying durations because the etiology of the disability may be due to a congenital cause, injury, or disease. Thus, some beneficiaries experiencing temporary disability may need mobi lity assistance on a short -term basis, while in contrast, those living with chronic conditions or enduring disabilities will require mobility assistance on a permanent basis. Medicare beneficiaries who depend upon mobility assistance are found in varied l iving situations. Some may live alone and independently while others may live with a caregiver or in a custodial care facility. The beneficiary's environment is relevant to the determination of the appropriate form of mobility assistance that should be e mployed. For many patients, a device of some sort is compensation for the mobility deficit. Many beneficiaries experience co- morbid conditions that can impact their ability to safely utilize MAE independently or to successfully regain independent function even with mobility assistance. The functional limitation as experienced by a beneficiary depends on the beneficiary's physical and psychological function, the availability of other support, and the beneficiary's living environment. A few examples include muscular spasticity, cognitive deficits, the availability of a caregiver, and the physical layout, surfaces, and obstacles that exist in the beneficiary's living environment. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective May 5, 2005, CMS finds that the evidence is adequate to determine that MAE is reasonable and necessary for beneficiaries who have a personal mobility deficit sufficient to impair their participation in mobility -related activities of daily living (MRADLs) such as toileting, feeding, dres sing, grooming, and bathing in customary locations within the home. Determination of the presence of a mobility deficit will be made by an algorithmic process, Clinical Criteria for MAE Coverage, to provide the appropriate MAE to correct the mobility deficit. Clinical Criteria for MAE Coverage The beneficiary, the beneficiary's family or other caregiver, or a clinician, will usually initiate the discussion and consideration of MAE use. Sequential consideration of the questions below provides clinical guidance for the coverage of equipment of appropriate type and complexity to restore the beneficiary's ability to participate in MRADLs such as toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, and bathing in customary locations in the home. These questions correspond to the numbered decision points on the accompanying flow chart. In individual cases where the beneficiary's condition clearly and unambiguously precludes the reasonable use of a device, it is not necessary to undertake a trial of that device for that beneficiary. 1. Does the beneficiary have a mobility limitation that significantly impairs his/her ability to participate in one or more MRADLs in the home? A mobility limitation is one that: a. Prevents the beneficiary from accomplishing the MRADLs entirely, or, b. Places the beneficiary at reasonably determined heightened risk of morbidity or mortality secondary to the attempts to participate in MRADLs, or, c. Prevents the beneficiary from completing the MRADLs within a reasonable time frame. 2. Are there other conditions that limit the beneficiary's ability to participate in MRADLs at home? a. Some examples are significant impairment of cognition or judgment and/or vision. b. For these beneficiaries, the provision of MAE might not enable them to participate in MRADLs if the comorbidity prevents effective use of the wheelchair or reasonable completion of the tasks even with MAE. 3. If these other limitations exist, can they be ameliorated or compensated sufficiently such that the addit ional provision of MAE will be reasonably expected to significantly improve the beneficiary's ability to perform or obtain assistance to participate in MRADLs in the home? a. A caregiver, for example a family member, may be compensatory, if consistently available in the beneficiary's home and willing and able to safely operate and transfer the beneficiary to and from the wheelchair and to transport the beneficiary using the wheelchair. The caregiver's need to use a wheelchair to assist the beneficiary in the MRADLs is to be considered in this determination. b. If the amelioration or compensation requires the beneficiary's compliance with treatment, for example medications or therapy, substantive non- compliance, whether willing or involuntary, can be grounds for denial of MAE coverage if it results in the beneficiary continuing to have a significant limitation. It may be determined that partial compliance results in adequate amelioration or compensation for the appropriate use of MAE. 4. Does the benefic iary or caregiver demonstrate the capability and the willingness to consistently operate the MAE safely? a. Safety considerations include personal risk to the beneficiary as well as risk to others. The determination of safety may need to occur several ti mes during the process as the consideration focuses on a specific device. b. A history of unsafe behavior in other venues may be considered. 5. Can the functional mobility deficit be sufficiently resolved by the prescription of a cane or walker? a. The cane or walker should be appropriately fitted to the beneficiary for this evaluation. b. Assess the beneficiary's ability to safely use a cane or walker. 6. Does the beneficiary's typical environment support the use of wheelchairs including scooters /power -operated vehicles (POVs)? a. Determine whether the beneficiary's environment will support the use of these types of MAE. b. Keep in mind such factors as physical layout, surfaces, and obstacles, which may render MAE unusable in the beneficiary's home. 7. Does the beneficiary have sufficient upper extremity function to propel a manual wheelchair in the home to participate in MRADLs during a typical day? The manual wheelchair should be optimally configured (seating options, wheelbase, device weight, and other appropriate accessories) for this determination. a. Limitations of strength, endurance, range of motion, coordination, and absence or deformity in one or both upper extremities are relevant. b. A beneficiary with sufficient upper extremity f unction may qualify for a manual wheelchair. The appropriate type of manual wheelchair, i.e. light weight, etc., should be determined based on the beneficiary's physical characteristics and anticipated intensity of use. c. The beneficiary's home should provide adequate access, maneuvering space and surfaces for the operation of a manual wheelchair. d. Assess the beneficiary's ability to safely use a manual wheelchair. NOTE: If the beneficiary is unable to self -propel a manual wheelchair, and if there i s a caregiver who is available, willing, and able to provide assistance, a manual wheelchair may be appropriate. 8. Does the beneficiary have sufficient strength and postural stability to operate a POV/scooter? a. A POV is a 3 - or 4-wheeled device with tiller steering and limited seat modification capabilities. The beneficiary must be able to maintain stability and position for adequate operation. b. The beneficiary's home should provide adequate access, maneuvering space and surfaces for the oper ation of a POV. c. Assess the beneficiary's ability to safely use a POV/scooter. 9. Are the additional features provided by a power wheelchair needed to allow the beneficiary to participate in one or more MRADLs? a. The pertinent features of a power wh eelchair compared to a POV are typically control by a joystick or alternative input device, lower seat height for slide transfers, and the ability to accommodate a variety of seating needs. b. The type of wheelchair and options provided should be appropri ate for the degree of the beneficiary's functional impairments. c. The beneficiary's home should provide adequate access, maneuvering space and surfaces for the operation of a power wheelchair. d. Assess the beneficiary's ability to safely use a power wh eelchair. NOTE: If the beneficiary is unable to use a power wheelchair, and if there is a caregiver who is available, willing, and able to provide assistance, a manual wheelchair is appropriate. A caregiver's inability to operate a manual wheelchair can be considered in covering a power wheelchair so that the caregiver can assist the beneficiary. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications Medicare beneficiaries not meeting the clinical criteria for prescribing MAE as outlined above, and as documented by the beneficiary's physician, would not be eligible for Medicare coverage of the MAE. D. Other All other durable medical equipment (DME) not meeting the definition of MAE as described in this instruction will continue to be covered, or nonc overed, as is currently described in the NCD Manual, in Section 280, Medical and Surgical Supplies. Also, all other sections not altered here and the corresponding policies regarding MAEs which have not been discussed here remain unchanged. (This NCD las t reviewed May 2005). Cross -references: section 280.1 of the NCD Manual. 280.4 - Seat Lift (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 60 -8 Reimbursement may be made for the rental or purchase of a medically necessary seat lift when prescribed by a physician for a patient w ith severe arthritis of the hip or knee and patients with muscular dystrophy or other neuromuscular disease when it has been determined the patient can benefit therapeutically from use of the device. In establishing medical necessity for the seat lift, the evidence must show that the item is included in the physician's course of treatment, that it is likely to effect improvement, or arrest or retard deterioration in the patient's condition, and that the severity of the condition is such that the alternative would be chair or bed confinement. Coverage of seat lifts is limited to those types which operate smoothly, can be controlled by the patient, and effectively assist a patient in standing up and sitting down without other assistance. Excluded from cover age is the type of lift which operates by a spring release mechanism with a sudden, catapult -like motion and jolts the patient from a seated to a standing position. Limit the payment for units which incorporate a recliner feature along with the seat lift to the amount payable for a seat lift without this feature.

The garment is intermittently inflated and deflated with cycle times and pressures that vary between devices. Pneumatic devices are covered for the treatment of lymphedema or for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency with venous stasis ulcers. Lymphedema Lymphedema is the swelling of subcutaneous tissues due to the accumulation of excessive lymph fluid. The accumulation of lymph fluid results from impairment to the normal clearing function of the lymphatic system and/or from an excessive production of lymph. Lymphedema is divided into two broad classes according to etiology. Primary lymphedema is a relatively uncommon, chronic condition which may be due to such causes as Milroy's Disease or congenital anomalies. Secondary lymphedema which is much more common, results from the destruction of or damage to formerly functioning lymphatic channels, such as surgical removal of lymph nodes or post radiation fibrosis, among other causes. Pneumatic compression devices are covered in the home setting for the treatment of lymphedema if the patient has undergone a four -week trial of conservative therapy and the treating physician determines that there has been no significant improvement or if significant symptoms remain after the trial. The trial of conservative therapy must include use of an appropriate compression banda ge system or compression garment, exercise, and elevation of the limb. The garment may be prefabricated or custom -fabricated but must provide adequate graduated compression. Chronic Venous Venous Stasis Ulcers Chronic venous insuffici ency (CVI) of the lower extremities is a condition caused by abnormalities of the venous wall and valves, leading to obstruction or reflux of blood flow in the veins. Signs of CVI include hyperpigmentation, stasis dermatitis, chronic edema, and venous ulcers. Pneumatic compression devices are covered in the home setting for the treatment of CVI of the lower extremities only if the patient has one or more venous stasis ulcer(s) which have failed to heal after a six month trial of conservative therapy directed by the treating physician. The trial of conservative therapy must include a compression bandage system or compression garment, appropriate dressings for the wound, exercise, and elevation of the limb. General Coverage Criteria Pneumatic compression devices are covered only when prescribed by a physician and when they are used with appropriate physician oversight, i.e., physician evaluation of the patient's condition to determine medical necessity of the device, assuring suitable instruction in the operation of the machine, a treatment plan defining the pressure to be used and the frequency and duration of use, and ongoing monitoring of use and response to treatment. The determination by the physician of the medical necessity of a pneumatic compression device must include: 1. The patient's diagnosis and prognosis; 2. Symptoms and objective findings, including measurements which establish the severity of the condition; 3. The reason the device is required, including the treatments which have been tried and failed; and 4. The clinical response to an initial treatment with the device. The clinical response includes the change in pretreatment measurements, ability to tolerate the treatment session and parameters, and ability of the patient (or caregiver) to apply the device for continued use in the home. The only time that a segmented, calibrated gradient pneumatic compression device (HCPCS code E0652) would be covered is when the individual has unique characteristics that prevent them from rec eiving satisfactory pneumatic compression treatment using a nonsegmented device in conjunction with a segmented appliance or a segmented compression device without manual control of pressure in each chamber. Cross Reference: \u00a7280.1 . 280.7 - Hospital Beds Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD -10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) A. General Requirements for Coverage of Hospital Beds A physician's prescription and such additional documentation as the DME MAC medical staff may consider necessary, including medical records and physicians' reports, must establish the medical necessity for a hospital bed due to one of the following reasons: The p atient's condition requires positioning of the body; e.g., to alleviate pain, promote good body alignment, prevent contractures, avoid respiratory infections, in ways not feasible in an ordinary bed; or The patient's condition requires special attachments that cannot be fixed and used on an ordinary bed. B. Physician's Prescription The physician's prescription which must accompany the initial claim, and supplementing documentation when required, must establish that a hospital bed is medically necessary. If the stated reason for the need for a hospital bed is the patient's condition requires positioning, the prescription or other documentation must describe the medical condition, e.g., cardiac disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, quadriplegia or paraplegia, and also the severity and frequency of the symptoms of the condition that necessitates a hospital bed for positioning. If the stated reason for requiring a hospital bed is the patient's condition requires special attachments, the prescripti on must describe the patient's condition and specify the attachments that require a hospital bed. C. Variable Height Feature In well documented cases, the DME MAC medical staff may determine that a variable height feature of a hospital bed, approved for coverage under subsection A above, is medically necessary and, therefore, covered, for one of the following conditions: Severe arthritis and other injuries to lower extremities; e.g., fractured hip - The condition requires the variable height feature to assist the patient to ambulate by enabling the patient to place his or her feet on the floor while sitting on the edge of the bed; Severe cardiac conditions - For those cardiac p atients who are able to leave bed, but who must avoid the strain of \"jumping\" up or down; Spinal cord injuries, including quadriplegic and paraplegic patients, multiple limb amputee and stroke patients. For those patients who are able to transfer from be d to a wheelchair, with or without help; or, Other severely debilitating diseases and conditions, if the variable height feature is required to assist the patient to ambulate. D. Electric Powered Hospital Bed Adjustments Electric powered adjustments to lower and raise head and foot may be covered when the DME MAC medical staff determines that the patient's condition requires frequent change in body position and/or there may be an immediate need for a change in body position (i.e., no delay can be tolerated) and the patient can operate the controls and cause the adjustments. Exceptions may be made to this last requirement in cases of spinal cord injury and brain damaged patients. E. Side Rails If the patient's condition requires bed side rails, they can be covered when an integral part of, or an accessory to, a hospital bed. 280.8 - Air-Fluidized Bed (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 60 -19 Air fluidized beds are covered for services rendered on or after: July 30, 1990. An air -fluidized bed uses w arm air under pressure to set small ceramic beads in motion which simulate the movement of fluid. When the patient is placed in the bed, his body weight is evenly distributed over a large surface area which creates a sensation of \"floating.\" Medicare pay ment for home use of the air -fluidized bed for treatment of pressure sores can be made if such use is reasonable and necessary for the individual patient. A decision that use of an air -fluidized bed is reasonable and necessary requires that: The patient has a stage 3 (full thickness tissue loss) or stage 4 (deep tissue destruction) pressure sore; The patient is bedridden or chair bound as a result of severely limited mobilit y; In the absence of an air -fluidized bed, the patient would require institutionalization; The air -fluidized bed is ordered in writing by the patient's attending physician based upon a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the patient after completi on of a course of conservative treatment designed to optimize conditions that promote wound healing. This course of treatment must have been at least one month in duration without progression toward wound healing. This month of prerequisite conservative treatment may include some period in an institution as long as there is documentation available to verify that the necessary conservative treatment has been rendered. Use of wet -to-dry dressings for wound debridement, begun during the period of conservati ve treatment and which continue beyond 30 days, will not preclude coverage of air - fluidized bed. Should additional debridement again become necessary, while a patient is using an air -fluidized bed (after the first 30- day course of conservative treatment) that will not cause the air -fluidized bed to become noncovered. In all instances documentation verifying the continued need for the bed must be available. A trained adult caregiver is available to assist the patient with activities of daily living, fluid balance, dry skin care, repositioning, recognition and management of altered mental status, dietary needs, prescribed treatments, and management and support of the air -fluidized bed system and its problems such as leakage; A physician directs the home tr eatment regimen, and reevaluates and recertifies the need for the air -fluidized bed on a monthly basis; and All other alternative equipment has been considered and ruled out. Conservative treatment must include: Frequent repositioning of the patient wit h particular attention to relief of pressure over bony prominences (usually every 2 hours); Use of a specialized support surface (Group II) designed to reduce pressure and shear forces on healing ulcers and to prevent new ulcer formation; Necessary treatment to resolve any wound infection; Optimization of nutrition status to promote wound healing; Debridement by any means (including wet to dry dressings -which does not require an occlusive covering) to remove devitalized tissue from the wound bed; Maintenance of a clean, moist bed of granulation tissue with appropriate moist dressings protected by an occlusive covering, while the wound heals. Home use of the air -fluidized bed is not covered under any of the following circumstances: The p atient has coexisting pulmonary disease (the lack of firm back support makes coughing ineffective and dry air inhalation thickens pulmonary secretions); The patient requires treatment with wet soaks or moist wound dressings that are not protected with an impervious covering such as plastic wrap or other occlusive material; The caregiver is unwilling or unable to provide the type of care required by the patient on an air -fluidized bed; Structural support is inadequate to support the weight of the air -fluidized bed system (it generally weighs 1600 pounds or more); Electrical system is insufficient for the anticipated increase in energy consumption; or Other known contraindications exist. Coverage of an air -fluidized bed is limited to the equipment itself. Payment for this covered item may only be made if the written order from the attending physician is furnished to the supplier prior to the delivery of the equipment. Payment is not included for the caregiver or for architectural adjustments such as el ectrical or structural improvement.

The coverage of artif icial arms and legs includes payment for terminal devices such as hands or hooks even though the patient may not require an artificial limb. The function of the prosthetic shoe is quite distinct from that of excluded orthopedic shoe and supportive foot devices which are used by individuals whose feet, although impaired, are essentially intact. (Section 1862(a)(8) of the Act excludes payment for orthopedic shoes or other supportive devices for the feet.) See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Services,\" \u00a7130. 280.11 - Corset Used as Hernia Support (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 70 -1 A hernia support (whether in the form of a corset or truss) which meets the definition of a brace is covered under Part B under \u00a71861(s)(9) of the Act. See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Services,\" \u00a7130. 280.12 - Sykes Hernia Control (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 70 -2 Based on professional advice, it has been determined that the sykes hernia control (a spring-type, U-shaped, strapless truss) is not functionally more beneficial than a conventional truss. Make program reimbursement for this device only when an ordinary truss would be covered. (Like all trusses, it is only of benefit when dealing with a reducible hernia). Thus, when a charge for this item is substantially in excess of that which would be reasonable for a conventional truss used for the same condition, base reimbursement on the reasonable charges for the conventional truss. See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Services,\" \u00a7130. 280.13 - Transcutaneous Effective: 04 -10-23; Implementation:04-10-23) 280.13 has been removed from the NCD Manual and incorporated into NCD 160.27 effective June 8, 2012. 280.14 - Infusion Pumps (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04- 14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD -10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10) A. General Infusion pumps are medical devices used to deliver solutions containing parenteral drugs under pressure at a regulated flow rate. B. Nationally Covered Indications The following indications for treatment using infusion pumps are covered under Medicare: 1. External Infusion Pumps a. Iron Poisoning (Effective for Services Performed On or After September 26, 1984) When used in the administration of deferoxamine for the treatment of acute iron poisoning and iron overload, only external infusion pumps are covered. b. Thromboembolic Disease (Effective for Services Performed On or After September 26, 1984) When used in the administration of heparin for the treatment of thromboembolic disease and/or pulmonary emboli sm, only external infusion pumps used in an institutional setting are covered. c. Chemotherapy for Liver Cancer (Effective for Services Performed On or After January 29, 1985) The external chemotherapy infusion pump is covered when used in the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma or colorectal cancer where this disease is unresectable; OR, where the patient refuses surgical excision of the tumor. d. Morphine for Intractable Cancer Pain (Effective for Services Performed On or After April 22, 1985) Morphine infusion via an external infusion pump is covered when used in the treatment of intractable pain caused by cancer (in either an inpatient or outpatient setting, including a hospice). e. Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) Pumps (Ef fective for Services Performed On or after December 17, 2004) Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and related drugs/supplies are covered as medically reasonable and necessary in the home setting for the treatment of diabetic patients who: (1) either meet the updated fasting C -Peptide testing requirement, or, are beta cell autoantibody positive; and, (2) satisfy the remaining criteria for insulin pump therapy as described below. Patients must meet either Criterion A or B as follows: Criterion A: The patient has completed a comprehensive diabetes education program, and has been on a program of multiple daily injections of insulin (i.e., at least 3 injections per day), with frequent self -adjustments of insulin doses for at least 6 months prior to initiation of the insulin pump, and has documented frequency of glucose self -testing an average of at least 4 times per day during the 2 months prior to initiation of the insulin pump, and meets one or more of the following criteria while on the multiple daily injection regimen: Glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbAlc) >7.0%; History of recurring hypoglycemia; Wide fluctuations in blood glucose before mealtime; Dawn phenomenon with fasting blood sugars frequently exceeding 200 mg/dl; or, History of severe glycemic excursions. Criterion B: The patient with diabetes has been on a pump prior to enrollment in Medicare and has documented frequency of glucose self -testing an average of at least 4 times per day during the month prior to Medicare enrollment. General CSII Criteria In addition to meeting Criterion A or B above, the following general requirements must be met: The patient with diabetes must be insulinopenic per the updated fasting C -peptide testing requirement, or, as an alternative, must be beta cell autoantibody positive. Updated fasting C -peptide testing requirement: Insulinopenia is defined as a fasting C -peptide level that is less than or equal to 110% of the lower limit of normal of the laboratory's measurement method. For patients with renal insufficiency and creatinine clearance (actual or calculated from age, gender, weight, and serum creatinine) 50 ml/minute, insulinopenia is defined as a fas ting C - peptide level that is less than or equal to 200% of the lower limit of normal of the laboratory's measurement method. Fasting C -peptide levels will only be considered valid with a concurrently obtained fasting glucose 225 mg/dL. Levels only need to be documented once in the medical records. Continued coverage of the insulin pump would require that the patient be seen and evaluated by the treating physician at least every 3 months. The pump must be ordered by and follow -up care of the patient must be managed by a physician who manages multiple patients with CSII and who works closely with a team including nurses, diabetes educators, and dietitians who are knowledgeable in the use of CSII. Other Uses of CSII The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will continue to allow coverage of all other uses of CSII in accordance with the Category B investigational device exemption clinical trials regulation (42 CFR 405.201) or as a routine cost under the clinical trials policy (Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual 310.1). f. Other Uses Other uses of external infusion pumps are covered if the DME MAC medical staff verifies the appropriateness of the therapy and the prescribed pump for the individual pa tient. NOTE: Payment may also be made for drugs necessary for the effective use of a covered external infusion pump as long as the drug being used with the pump is itself reasonable and necessary for the patient's treatment. 2. Implantable Infusion Pump s a. Chemotherapy for Liver Cancer (Effective for Services Performed On or After September 26, 1984) The implantable infusion pump is covered for intra -arterial infusion of 5- FUdR for the treatment of liver cancer for patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma or Duke's Class D colorectal cancer, in whom the metastases are limited to the liver, and where: (1) the disease is unresectable, or, (2) the patient refuses surgical excision of the tumor. b. Anti -Spasmodic Drugs for Severe Spasticity An implantable infusion pump is covered when used to administer anti -spasmodic drugs intrathecally (e.g., baclofen) to treat chronic intractable spasticity in patients who have proven unresponsive to less invasive medical therapy as determined by the following criteria: As indicated by at least a 6 -week trial, the patient cannot be maintained on non- invasive methods of spasm control, such as oral anti -spasmodic drugs, either because these methods fail to control adequately the spasticity or produce intolerable side effects. And prior to pump implantation, the patient must have responded favorably to a trial intrathecal dose of the anti -spasmodic drug. c. Opioid Drugs for Treatment of Chronic Intractable Pain An implantable infusion pump is covered when used to administer opioid drugs (e.g., morphine) intrathecally or epidurally for treatment of severe chronic intractable pain of malignant or nonmalignant origin in patients who have a life expectancy of at least 3 months, and who have proven unresponsive to less invasive medical therapy as determined by the following criteria: The patient's history must indicate that he/she would not respond adequately to noninvasive methods of pain control, such as systemic opioids (including attempts to elimi nate physical and behavioral abnormalities which may cause an exaggerated reaction to pain); and a preliminary trial of intraspinal opioid drug administration must be undertaken with a temporary intrathecal/epidural catheter to substantiate adequately acceptable pain relief and degree of side effects (including effects on the activities of daily living) and patient acceptance. d. Coverage of Other Uses of Implanted Infusion Pumps Determinations may be made on coverage of other uses of implanted infusion pumps if the MAC medical staff verifies that: The drug is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the individual patient; It is medically necessary that the drug be administered by an implanted infusion pump; and, The Food and Drug Administration- approved labeling for the pump must specify that the drug being administered and the purpose for which it is administered is an indicated use for the pump. e. Implantation of Infusion Pump Is Contraindicated The implantation of an infusion pump is contraindicated in the following patients: With a known allergy or hypersensitivity to the drug being used (e.g., oral baclofen, morphine, etc.); or, Who have an active infection; or, Whose body size is insufficient to support the weight and bulk of the device; or, With other implanted programmable devices since crosstalk between devices may inadvertently change the prescription. NOTE: Payment may also be made for drugs necessary for the effective use of an implantable infusion pump as long as the drug being used with the pump is itself reasonable and necessary for the patient's treatment. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications The following indications for treatment using infusion pumps are not covered under Medicare: 1. External Infusion Pu mps Vancomycin (Effective for Services Beginning On or After September 1, 1996) Medicare coverage of vancomycin as a durable medical equipment infusion pump benefit is not covered. There is insufficient evidence to support the necessity of using an external infusion pump, instead of a disposable elastomeric pump or the gravity drip m ethod, to administer vancomycin in a safe and appropriate manner. 2. Implantable Infusion Pump a. Thromboembolic Disease (Effective for Services Performed On or After September 26, 1984) There is insufficient published clinical data to support the safet y and effectiveness of the heparin implantable pump. Therefore, the use of an implantable infusion pump for infusion of heparin in the treatment of recurrent thromboembolic disease is not covered. b. Diabetes An implanted infusion pump for the infusion of insulin to treat diabetes is not covered. The data does not demonstrate that the pump provides effective administration of insulin. D. Other Not applicable. 280.15 - INDEPENDENCE iBOT 4000 Mobility System (Effective July 27, (Rev. 02- 23-07; Effective: The INDEPENDENCE iBOT 4000 Mobility System is a battery- powered mobility device that relies on a computerized system of sensors, gyroscopes, and electric motors to allow indoor and outdoor use on stairs as well as on level and uneven surfaces. The mobility system incorporates a number of different functions, including: a) Standard Function that provides mobility on smooth surfaces and inclines at home, work, and in other environments; b) 4- Wheel Function that provides movement across obstacles, uneven terrain, curbs, grass, gravel, and other soft surfaces; c) Balance Function that provides mobility in a seated position at an elevated height; d) Stair Function that allows for ascent and descent of stairs, with or without assistance; and e) Remote Function that assists in the tr ansportation of the product while unoccupied. In Standard Function, the INDEPENDENCE iBOT 4000 Mobility System functions like a traditional power wheelchair. The mobility device can be programmed for Standard Function only to meet the assessed needs of t he user. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for services performed on and after July 27, 2006, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) finds that the evidence is sufficient to determine that the Standard Function of the INDEPENDENCE iBOT 4000 Mobility System meets the definition of Durable Medical Equipment (DME) under section 1861(n) of the Social Security Act (the Act) as a wheelchair used in the patient's home that is reasonable and necessary for beneficiaries who have a personal m obility deficit sufficient to impair their participation in mobility -related activities of daily living (MRADL), such as toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, and bathing in customary locations in the home. Determination of the presence of a mobility de ficit will use an algorithmic process, as outlined in Chapter 1, Part 4, Section 280.3 of this manual. C. Nationally Non -covered Indications Effective for services performed on and after July 27, 2006, CMS has reviewed the evidence and concludes that the 4 -Wheel, Balance, Stair and Remote Functions of the INDEPENDENCE iBOT 4000 Mobility System do not meet the definition of DME under section 1861(n) of the Act. D. Other N/A (This NCD last reviewed July 2006) 280.16 Seat Elevation Equipment (Power Operated) on Power Wheelchairs (Rev. 12183, Issued:08- 03-23, Effective:05- 16-23, Implementation:09- 04-23) A. General Power seat elevation equipment used with a power wheelchair raises and lowers users while they remain in the seated position. This e quipment uses an electromechanical lift system to provide varying amounts of vertical seat to floor height. It does not change the seated angles or the seat's angle relative to the ground. Complex rehabilitative power -driven wheelchairs are defined in 42 C FR \u00a7414.202. B. Nationally Covered Indications Effective for services performed on or after May 16, 2023, power seat elevation equipment is reasonable and necessary for individuals using complex rehabilitative power -driven wheelchairs, when the following c onditions are met: 1. The individual has undergone a specialty evaluation that confirms the individual's ability to safely operate the seat elevation equipment in the home. This evaluation must be performed by a licensed/certified medical professional such as a physical ther apist (PT), occupational therapist (OT), or other practitioner, who has specific training and experience in rehabilitation wheelchair evaluations; and, 2. At least one of the following apply: a. The individual performs weight bearing transfers to/from the power wheelchair while in the home, using either their upper extremities during a non- level (uneven) sitting transfer and/or their lower extremities during a sit to stand transfer. Transfers m ay be accomplished with or without caregiver assistance and/or the use of assistive equipment (e.g. sliding board, cane, crutch, walker, etc.); or, b. The individual requires a non- weight bearing transfer (e.g. a dependent transfer) to/from the power wheel chair while in the home. Transfers may be accomplished with or without a floor or mounted lift; or, c. The individual performs reaching from the power wheelchair to complete one or more mobility related activities of daily living (MRADLs) such as toileting , feeding, dressing, grooming and bathing in customary locations within the home. MRADLs may be accomplished with or without caregiver assistance and/or the use of assistive equipment. C. Nationally Non -Covered Indications N/A D. Other The Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractor (DME MAC) has discretion to determine reasonable and necessary coverage of power seat elevation equipment for individuals who use Medicare covered power wheelchairs other than complex rehabilitative power -driven wheelchairs.

Cross- references: Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Health Services.\" Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapters 20, \"Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics and Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS),\" 23, \"Fee Schedule Administration and Coding Requirements.\" 290 - Nursing Services (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) 290.1 - Home Health Visits to a Blind Diabetic (Rev. 55, Issued: 05- 05-06, Effective: 10 -01-06, Implem entation: 10 -02-06) Many individuals who are blind and require daily insulin for the control of a diabetic condition are able to administer their injections without assistance (other than possibly that which may be furnished by family members or friends). There are organizations which encourage and train blind diabetics, both to fill their own syringes and to inject themselves. There are also a number of devices available for blind individuals to fill their syringes accurately. However, the individuals who may need assistance with prefilling their syringes may also require periodic observation and evaluation, even though their diabetes is fairly stabilized. In such cases, probably few in number, home health services may be required for this purpose. To qualify for home health benefits, a blind diabetic must be confined to his home, under the care of a physician, and in need of either skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis or physical therapy or speech- language pathology services. Effective J uly 1, 1981, a person may qualify for home health benefits based on his or her need for skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis, physical therapy, speech- language pathology, or occupational therapy. Effective December 1, 1981, occupational thera py is eliminated as a basis for entitlement to home health services. However, if a person has otherwise qualified for home health services because of the need for skilled nursing care, physical therapy or speech-language pathology, the patient's eligibility for home health services may be extended solely on the basis of the continuing need for occupational therapy. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 7, \"Home Health Services,\" \u00a720.) There must be a plan of treatment, established and periodica lly reviewed by a physician, which indicates that there is a recurring need for home health services to supplement the physician's contacts with the patient; e.g., skilled nursing visits for observing and determining the need for changes in the level and t ype of care which has been prescribed. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 7, \"Home Health Services,\" \u00a7\u00a730.) Once an initial regimen has been established, the frequency of need for further home health services can vary greatly from patient to patient, depending on their condition and the likelihood of its changing. Some may need visits only every 90 days, for example, while others may require them much more frequently. If a nurse makes a visit to provide skilled services, and also prefills syringes, the purpose of the visit which was to provide skilled services, does not change. However, if the sole purpose of the nurse's visit is to prefill insulin syringes for a blind diabetic, it is not a skilled nursing visit although it may be reimbursed as such as indicated below. Filling a syringe can be safely and effectively performed by the average nonmedical person without the direct supervision of a licensed nurse. Consequently, it would not constitute a skilled nursing service even if it is performed by a nurse. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 7, \"Home Health Services,\" \u00a730.2.2.) The personal care duties normally performed by home health aides include assisting the patient with medications ordered by a physician which are or dinarily self -administered. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 7, \"Home Health Services,\" \u00a750.2.) Performance of such a service by an aide is consistent with the Medicare conditions of participation for home health agencies. Therefore, home health aide services would be appropriate for those blind diabetics who are qualified for home health benefits and who cannot fill their syringes. An adequately trained home health aide could make intermittent visits, usually on a weekly basis, to the home for the purpose of filling that supply of insulin ordered by the physician. If State law, however, precludes a home health aide from prefilling insulin syringes, payment may be made for this service as part of the cost of skilled nursing services when performed by a nurse for a blind diabetic who is otherwise unable to prefill his or her syringes. There are no adverse consequences with respect to reimbursement to the home health agency for providing the service in this manner. If State law does not pr eclude a home health aide from prefilling insulin syringes, but the home health agency chooses to send a nurse to perform only this task, the visit is reimbursed as if made by a home health aide. NOTE: As indicated, to qualify for home health benefits, a patient must require skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis or physical therapy or speech -language pathology. If a beneficiary does not qualify for home health benefits but only needs someone to prefill syringes with the correct dosage of insul in, then no program payment can be made.

Health Nurses' Visits to Patients Requiring Heparin Injections (Rev. 1, 10- 03-03) CIM 90 -2 Professional medical advice indicates that subcutaneous injections of low dose heparin can be, under certain circumstances, medically accepted therapy for the treatment of recurrent deep venous thrombosis, recurrent pulmonary emboli, and other conditions requiring long term anticoagulation. The usual drug of choice for these conditions is warfarin. Heparin may be substituted for warfarin in circumstances such as demonstrated warfarin sensitivity. Heparin is now the drug of choice for anticoagulation during pregnancy. Medicare payment may be made for serial visits by the home health nurse to teach the patient or the caring person to give subcutaneous injections of low dose heparin if it is prescribed by a physician for a homebound patient who: Is pregnant and requires anticoagulant therapy, or Requires treatment for deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary emboli or for another condition requiring anticoagulation and documentation justifies that the patient cannot tolerate warfarin. If the patient or caring person is unable to administer the injection, nursing visits to give the injections on a daily basis, 7 days a week, for a period of up to 6 months (in the case of pregnancy, visits may be made for a period beyond 6 months if reasonable and necessary) would be reimbursed by Medicare. Coverage for these services after 6 months of treatment would be provided only if the prescribing physician can justify and document the need for such an extended course of treatment. Documentation of need for heparin injections beyond 6 months would not be required for pregnant patients who meet the homebound criteria.

All other M edicare rules apply. Routine costs of a clinical trial include all items and services that are otherwise generally available to Medicare beneficiaries (i.e., there exists a benefit category, it is not statutorily excluded, and there is not a national non- coverage decision) that are provided in either the experimental or the control arms of a clinical trial except: The investigational item or service, itself unless otherwise covered outside of the clinical trial; Items and services provided solely to sati sfy data collection and analysis needs and that are not used in the direct clinical management of the patient (e.g., monthly CT scans for a condition usually requiring only a single scan); and Items and services customarily provided by the research spons ors free -of-charge for any enrollee in the trial. Routine costs in clinical trials include: Items or services that are typically provided absent a clinical trial (e.g., conventional care); Items or services required solely for the provision of the investigational item or service (e.g., administration of a non- covered chemotherapeutic agent), the clinically appropriate monitoring of the effects of the item or service, or the prevention of com plications; and Items or services needed for reasonable and necessary care arising from the provision of an investigational item or service --in particular, for the diagnosis or treatment of complications. This policy does not withdraw Medicare coverage for items and services that may be covered according to local medical review policies (LMRPs) or the regulations on category B investigational device exemptions found in 42 CFR 405.201- 405.215, 411.15, and 411.406. For information about LMRPs, refer to ww w.lmrp.net, a searchable database of MAC local policies. For non- covered items and services, including items and services for which Medicare payment is statutorily prohibited, Medicare only covers the treatment of complications arising from the delivery of the non- covered item or service and unrelated reasonable and necessary care. However, if the item or service is not covered by virtue of a national non- coverage policy in Pub. 100-03, National Coverage Determination (NCD) Manual, and is the focus of a qualifying clinical trial, the routine costs of the clinical trial (as defined above) will be covered by Medicare but the non- covered item or service, itself, will not. A. Requirements for Medicare Coverage of Routine Costs Any clinical trial receiving M edicare coverage of routine costs must meet the following three requirements: The subject or purpose of the trial must be the evaluation of an item or service that falls within a Medicare benefit category (e.g., physicians' service, durable medical equipm ent, diagnostic test) and is not statutorily excluded from coverage (e.g., cosmetic surgery, hearing aids). The trial must not be designed exclusively to test toxicity or disease pathophysiology. It must have therapeutic intent. Trials of therapeutic interventions must enroll patients with diagnosed disease rather than healthy volunteers. Trials of diagnostic interventions may enroll healthy patients in order to have a proper control group. The three requirements above are insufficient by themselves to qualify a clinical trial for Medicare coverage of routine costs. Clinical trials also should have the following desirable characteristics; however, some trials, as described below, are presumed to meet these characteristics and are automatically qualified to receive Medicare coverage: 1. The principal purpose of the trial is to test whether the intervention potentially improves the participants' health outcomes; 2. The trial is well- supported by available scientific and medical information or it is int ended to clarify or establish the health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use; 3. The trial does not unjustifiably duplicate existing studies; 4. The trial design is appropriate to answer the research question being asked in the trial; 5. The trial is sponsored by a credible organization or individual capable of executing the proposed trial successfully; 6. The trial is in compliance with Fe deral regulations relating to the protection of human subjects; and 7. All aspects of the trial are conducted according to the appropriate standards of scientific integrity. B. Qualification Process for Clinical Trials Using the authority found in \u00a71142 of the Social Security Act (the Act) (cross -referenced in \u00a71862(a)(1)(E) of the Act), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) will convene a multi -agency Federal panel (the \"panel\") composed of representatives of the Department of Health and Human Services research agencies (National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), AHRQ, and the Office of Human Research Protection), and the research arms of the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop qualifying criteria that will indicate a strong probability that a trial exhibits the desirable characteristics listed above. These criteria will be easily verifiable, and where poss ible, dichotomous. Trials that meet these qualifying criteria will receive Medicare coverage of their associated routine costs. This panel is not reviewing or approving individual trials. The multi - agency panel will meet periodically to review and evaluate the program and recommend any necessary refinements to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Clinical trials that meet the qualifying criteria will receive Medicare coverage of routine costs after the trial's lead principal investigator c ertifies that the trial meets the criteria. This process will require the principal investigator to enroll the trial in a Medicare clinical trials registry, currently under development. Some clinical trials are automatically qualified to receive Medicare coverage of their routine costs because they have been deemed by AHRQ, in consultation with the other agencies represented on the multi -agency panel to be highly likely to have the above -listed seven desirable characteristics of clinical trials. The prin cipal investigators of these automatically qualified trials do not need to certify that the trials meet the qualifying criteria, but must enroll the trials in the Medicare clinical trials registry for administrative purposes, once the registry is establish ed. Effective September 19, 2000, clinical trials that are deemed to be automatically qualified are: 1. Trials funded by NIH, CDC, AHRQ, CMS, DOD, and VA; 2. Trials supported by centers or cooperative groups that are funded by the NIH, CDC, AHRQ, CMS, DOD, and VA; 3. Trials conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) reviewed by the FDA; and 4. Drug trials that are exempt from having an IND under 21 CFR 312.2(b)(1) will be deemed automatically qualified until the qualifying crite ria are developed and the certification process is in place. At that time the principal investigators of these trials must certify that the trials meet the qualifying criteria in order to maintain Medicare coverage of routine costs. This certification process will only affect the future status of the trial and will not be used to retroactively change the earlier deemed status. The CMS, through the NCD process, through an individualized assessment of benefits, risks, and research potential, may determine that certain items and services for which there is some evidence of significant medical benefit, but for which there is insufficient evidence to support a \"reas onable and necessary\" determination, are only reasonable and necessary when provided in a clinical trial that meets the requirements defined in that NCD. Medicare will cover the routine costs of qualifying trials that either have been deemed to be automat ically qualified, have certified that they meet the qualifying criteria, or are required through the NCD process, unless CMS's Chief Clinical Officer subsequently finds that a clinical trial does not meet the qualifying criteria or jeopardizes the safety o r welfare of Medicare beneficiaries. Should CMS find that a trial's principal investigator misrepresented that the trial met the necessary qualifying criteria in order to gain Medicare coverage of routine costs, Medicare coverage of the routine costs woul d be denied under \u00a71862(a)(1)(E) of the Act. In the case of such a denial, the Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the trial would not be held liable (i.e., would be held harmless from collection) for the costs consistent with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a71879, 1842(l), or 1834(j)(4) of the Act, as applicable. Where appropriate, the billing providers would be held liable for the costs and fraud investigations of the billing providers and the trial's principal investigator may be pursued. Medicare regulations requi re Medicare+Choice (M+C) organizations to follow CMS NCDs. This NCD raises special issues that require some modification of most M+C organizations' rules governing provision of items and services in and out of network. The items and services covered unde r this NCD are inextricably linked to the clinical trials with which they are associated and cannot be covered outside of the context of those clinical trials. M+C organizations therefore must cover these services regardless of whether they are available t hrough in- network providers. M+C organizations may have reporting requirements when enrollees participate in clinical trials, in order to track and coordinate their members' care, but cannot require prior authorization or approval.
