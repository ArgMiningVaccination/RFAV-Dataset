This guidance document was last updated May 10, 2023. This update includes changes to masking requirements and excludes higher education settings from the vaccination requirement. Changes are bolded for quick reference (bold headings excluded). The City of Philadelphia issued an Emergency Regulation Governing the Control and Prevention of COVID-19 Mandating Vaccines for Healthcare Workers and In Higher Education, Healthcare, and Related Settings (\"Vaccine Mandate Regulation\"), which mandates vaccine for healthcare workers and in higher education, healthcare, and related settings. This mandate became effective on August 16, 2021. Certain settings and individuals previously required to comply with the Vaccine Mandate Regulation are excluded from the vaccination requirements. These requirements are modified according to recommendations of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (the Health Department). Institutions of Higher Education (IHE's) are excluded from vaccination requirements unless qualifying as healthcare institutions or hosting covered healthcare workers. As of May 10, 2023, covered healthcare workers and individuals are no longer required by City regulation to wear a mask in healthcare settings. All symptomatic individuals must continue to test, regardless of vaccination status. See sections below on vaccination records and result reporting for further information. Any changes will be announced via traditional print and social media, posted on the Health Department's website, and communicated in Health Action Notifications (HAN). A healthcare institution may delegate responsibility for obtaining vaccine status, evaluating exemptions, and implementing appropriate accommodations to a contracting agency. If delegated, the contracting agency must agree to abide by the following requirements: An individual may not simply opt out of vaccination. They must submit a medical or religious exemption to the healthcare institution where such individual works according to the policies set by the institution. The institution will determine if an exemption applies. Healthcare institutions and organizations that are granting exemptions must create appropriate exemption policies to implement this regulation. Institutions may establish stricter vaccination policies for their workers, contractors, and volunteers that exceed the requirements of the Vaccine Mandate Regulation, to the extent otherwise permitted by applicable law. A covered healthcare worker who is granted an exemption must strictly follow the conditions for exemption. Healthcare institutions are required to keep records of vaccination status of all vaccinated individuals and exemptions requested. Records must be made available to the Health Department upon request. Self-employed covered healthcare workers must carefully document the need for exemption and ongoing compliance with conditions as set forth below under \"Conditions for Exceptions.\" The Covered healthcare worker may request an exemption by submitting a certification from a licensed healthcare provider to the appropriate healthcare institution. Medical exemptions must include a statement signed by a licensed healthcare provider that states the exemption applies to the specific individual submitting the certification because the COVID-19 vaccine is medically contraindicated for the individual. The certification must also be signed by the healthcare worker or healthcare institution worker. For the purposes of the Vaccine Mandate Regulation, a licensed healthcare provider means a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant licensed by an authorized state licensing board. The covered healthcare worker may request an exemption by submitting a signed statement in writing that the individual has a sincerely held religious belief that prevents them from receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. An institution may request the worker explain in the certification why the worker's religious belief prevents them receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Philosophical or moral exemptions are not permitted. The institution must maintain vaccination records and exemption records must be made available to the Health Department upon request. Vaccination records must include the following information: numbers of fully, partially, unvaccinated and vaccination status unknown staff/contractors; and numbers of staff/contractors with medical or religious exemptions. Contracting agencies are responsible for reporting vaccination status of their covered workers to the healthcare institution and must maintain all records relating to vaccination status. Please note: this information must not include any confidential information such as names, dates of birth, social security numbers, or employee identification numbers. If the employer is performing rapid testing under a CLIA certificate or waiver, positive results need to be reported to the Health Department within 24 hours of result. Results can be reported directly via a REDCap Database. Please contact [COVID.EPI@phila.gov](mailto:COVID.EPI@phila.gov) with any questions. If the employer is not performing the testing, they do not need to report the results to the Health Department. The results will be reported directly to the Health Department by the lab or provider. Beginning October 16th, 2021, the Health Department will exercise its inspection authority to review records per Chapter 6-500, Section 501 of the Philadelphia Code. These records must be made available to the Health Department upon request as dictated by Chapter 6-200, Section 202(4) of the Philadelphia Code and the August 4, 2022, AMENDMENT TO THE EMERGENCY REGULATION GOVERNING THE CONTROL AND PREVENTION OF COVID-19 MANDATING VACCINES FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND IN HIGHER EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, AND RELATED SETTINGS. Records may be examined via a future scheduled submission calendar and/or unannounced in-person or electronic compliance audits of records by Health Department personnel. Method and timeline for unannounced audits will be determined in part by information reported to the (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system and may be required in response to complaints received against an institution. Failure to comply may result in remediation planning or immediate penalties. These may include fines, license suspensions, and other civil remedies as provided for under Section 6-103 of The Philadelphia Code, provided that each day a violation of this Regulation continues constitutes a separate violation. If I received a single dose shot of J & J/Janssen, am I fully vaccinated to be in compliance with this mandate? Yes, J&J/Janssen is a one-dose COVID-19 vaccination approved by the FDA. If you completed one dose of this vaccine, you are fully vaccinated. I received two doses of the Novavax vaccine. Am I fully vaccinated to be in compliance with the mandate? Yes, the Novavax COVID-19 vaccination is approved by the FDA. If you completed two doses of this vaccine you are fully vaccinated. I have only received one bivalent dose of Pfizer or Moderna. Do I need to get a second dose to be considered fully vaccinated to be in compliance with this mandate? No, you are in compliance if you have completed either 1 updated bivalent dose of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. I have only received 1 monovalent dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, but never got the 2nd dose of the two-dose series. Am I fully vaccinated? No, in order to be in compliance, you need to complete 1 updated bivalent dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna. How are you recommending healthcare institutions handle exemptions? Does our institution need to create an exception committee to review, grant, or deny exemption requests? In the case of either exemption, an exemption committee is not required. It is up to the institution to determine the method most adaptable to its population's needs in reviewing and deciding upon exemption requests. What are the documents required for someone seeking a medical exemption? The individual must request an exemption by submitting a signed certification from a licensed healthcare provider and signed by the individual seeking the exemption to the appropriate institution. Each healthcare institution may determine if it will require additional documentation. The documents must include: The individual must also acknowledge the information on the exemption request is true and accurate. Section 1-108 of the Philadelphia Code uses the following language: \"I hereby certify that the statements contained herein are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \"I understand that if I knowingly make any false statement herein, I am subject to such penalties as may be prescribed by statute or ordinance. Signed ____________________ What are the documents required for someone seeking a religious exemption? The individual must request an exemption by submitting a statement that certifies they have a sincerely held religious belief that prevents them from receiving the vaccination. The documents must include: Section 1-108 of the Philadelphia Code uses the following language: \"I hereby certify that the statements contained herein are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \"I understand that if I knowingly make any false statement herein, I am subject to such penalties as may be prescribed by statute or ordinance. Signed ____________________ Are at-home tests a recognized form of testing? FDA-authorized at-home tests are a recognized form of testing. The Health Department cannot verify at-home testing results. Positive at home test results may be reported to MakeMyTestCount or directly to the City COVID-19 Test Reports (phila.gov) What can happen if a COVID-19 vaccination card is fraudulently used or provided? According to the FBI, unauthorized use of an official government agency's seal can be punished with a fine or up to five years in prison. What can happen if exemption letters are fraudulently provided? Use of certifications, such as letters from providers stating an individual has a false medical contraindication, is a violation of The Philadelphia Code and punishable by fines of up to $300 per violation. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Vaccine Mandate Regulation is also a violation of The Philadelphia Code and punishable by fines of up to $2,000 per violation for businesses, and up to $500 per violation for individuals. Is there clarification regarding what \"healthcare institution\" covers? A healthcare institution is any location where healthcare or healthcare-related services are available to or provided for individuals in person. This could be an in-patient or out-patient location. Locations where these services are incidental in nature, i.e., not the main part of the business, like a grocery store's pharmacy, are not considered healthcare institutions. Is there clarification regarding what \"healthcare workers\" covers? Any individual involved in patient-facing healthcare or healthcare-related services is a covered healthcare worker. This includes any individual who works in an area where healthcare or healthcare-related services are provided, including those who work, volunteer, or intern at, or are otherwise affiliated with, a healthcare institution where patients, clients, or visitors are present and receiving services. This requirement applies when the covered healthcare worker has direct contact with other staff, patients, clients, or visitors at the same Healthcare Institution in the course of their daily business or duties at that healthcare institution. For example: Does this mandate apply to either intermediate care facilities or rehab settings where nursing is provided and/or where health-related supports are rendered? Yes. If nursing or behavioral healthcare is provided or if other health-related supports are provided in person to patients or clients, those settings are covered under the regulation. Does this mandate apply to behavioral health facilities or drug and alcohol rehab settings where nursing is provided and/or where health-related supports are rendered? Yes. If nursing or behavioral healthcare is provided or if other health-related supports are provided in person to patients or clients, those settings are covered under the regulation. Does this mandate apply to direct care workers and direct support or direct service professionals (home healthcare workers)? Direct support professionals and other individuals providing services under a home-based care services waiver are not covered healthcare workers for the purposes of this mandate. Does this mandate apply to contract employees? Yes. Contract employees of healthcare institutions are included if they can be considered covered healthcare workers. The regulation defines healthcare workers based on the services provided or locations at which services are provided, not by the nature of the individual's employment status. What is the process if an employee refuses to comply? If an employee refuses to apply for an exemption and/or refuses the extra accommodation options, the institution may not continue to employ the individual in the capacity of a healthcare worker or healthcare institution worker doing work on location. The institution should consult with their legal department or human resources department on appropriate steps according to institutional policies. There are no philosophical, political, social, or economic exemptions available for the mandate. If the medical or religious exemption is not granted, employees may not provide in-person healthcare or healthcare-related services and may not work as a healthcare institution worker (i.e., for a healthcare institution in a building where other employees provide patients or clients with healthcare-related services). Who can I talk to if I have questions about this as an employee? In all cases, we recommend the employee speak with their HR representative and/or legal counsel regarding options. Employees may reach out to the Health Department with questions or concerns via the Call Center at [(215) 685-5488](tel:2156855488), email [covid@phila.gov](mailto:covid@phila.gov), or direct specific workplace-related concerns to the Office of Worker Protections at the Department of Labor at [(215) 686-0802](tel:2156860802). Who will be monitoring the compliance? The Health Department will monitor, and healthcare institutions are required to keep records of vaccination status of all covered individuals, exemptions requested and granted, and accommodations granted. Who is responsible for logging vaccination and testing results? Who will be checking from the City? The institution must maintain vaccination records and testing results. Any vaccination, exemption or testing records must be made available to the City upon request. If the employer is performing rapid testing under a CLIA certificate of waiver, positive results need to be reported to the Health Department within 24 hours of testing. Results can be reported directly via a REDCap database. Please contact [COVID.EPI@phila.gov](mailto:COVID.EPI@phila.gov) with any questions. If the employer is not performing the testing, they do not need to report the results to the Health Department. The results will be reported directly to the Health Department by the lab or provider.
