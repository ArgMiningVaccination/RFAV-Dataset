Please check back here for updates or e-mail any questions to: [ASKDPH@ct.gov](mailto:ASKDPH@ct.gov). Q: What does the end of the Public Health Emergency on May 11 mean? A: Earlier this year, President Biden announced that the nationally declared Public Health Emergency, would expire on May 11, 2023. Under U.S. law, the President can declare a national emergency in response to a disaster or crisis. While the emergency declaration is in effect, the executive branch can exercise \"emergency powers\" to address the crisis, such as providing various types of relief to individuals, and to state and local governments. When the nationally declared emergency ends, those powers are lifted, and policies that the President enacted using emergency powers expire. Governor Ned Lamont's declaration of a Public Health Emergency under Connecticut law provided that it would end at the same time as the nationally declared Public Health Emergency. Q: Does this mean that COVID-19 is gone for good? A: No. Ending the COVID-19 emergency declarations does not mean the virus has been eradicated. We can all stay healthy and live with COVID-19 and other viruses by getting fully vaccinated, staying home when we are sick, and practicing good hygiene. These same successful health prevention tools apply to many infectious diseases. It is why we have made so much progress in the past three years. Q: What should I do to protect myself from COVID-19? A: You still should get vaccinated, get the updated vaccine, use at-home tests, stay home when you are sick, and wear a high-quality mask when respiratory viruses are circulating at high levels in your community. These are all ways we can continue to protect ourselves and manage this virus. We hope that COVID-19 will follow the trajectory of other seasonal illnesses and remain ready to ramp up our efforts during respiratory disease season which typically runs from October through April. Please visit the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) ['s website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) for the latest COVID-19 guidance. Q: Is there updated guidance available for PreK-12 Schools? A: Yes. Please see this recent [document that includes FAQ's for PreK-12 Schools](/-/media/Departments-and-Agencies/DPH/dph/communications/Health-Topics/FINAL-EndofEmergency_FAQ_Schools_05012023.pdf). This document has been distributed to answer some of the lingering questions DPH and the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) have received in the past several months, and to pivot our reference for COVID-19 guidance in the future to the CDC's main COVID-19 information page, which can be found at [https://www.cdc.gov/covid19](https://www.cdc.gov/covid19). Q: Are there any updates on the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act? A: Yes, on May 9, 2023, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra signed the 11th amendment to the declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act for COVID-19 Medical Countermeasures. The Secretary issues this amendment to clarify that COVID-19 continues to pose a credible risk of a future public health emergency, add two new limitations on distribution, extend the time period of coverage for certain Covered Countermeasures and Covered Persons, clarify the time period of coverage for Covered Persons authorized under the Declaration, and extend the duration of the Declaration to December 31, 2024. Read full details of the amendment in the [Federal Register Notice online](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2023-10216.pdf). Q: What about my HUSKY/CHIP, SNAP or cash benefits? A: Please visit the Connecticut Department of Social Services' [\"Preparing for the End of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency webpage.\"](https://portal.ct.gov/phe/?language=en_US) Q: What is going to happen to the COVID Alert CT app?
