Not to mention, they make your home look and smell great. Whether you're a seasoned gardener or you've never grown plants at home before, this guide can help. We'll explain how [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/traditional-chinese-medicine/) uses medicinal plants and the best ones you can grow right at home. What Are Medicinal Plants? Medicinal plants are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as plants that possess compounds with therapeutic properties in their natural organic form or whose metabolites can be extracted to make useful drugs. About 25% of modern medicines have been developed from medicinal plants. The efficacy of medicinal plants is affected by the soil and region they are grown in. How Does TCM Use Medicinal Plants? Herbal and [plant medicine](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/natural-products/supplements/herbal-medicine-basics/) are a hallmark of TCM, often complementing modalities, such as acupuncture, [cupping](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/mental-health/stress-anxiety-relief/cupping-therapy/), moxibustion, [tuina massage](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/energy-and-immunity/tuina-massage/) and Qigong. Senior Physician Brandon Yew from Real Medical says that in TCM, each medicinal plant has its own properties and flavors, delivery propensities, toxicity and meridian tropism. The property of a herb refers to its warming or cooling effect on the body. It's not in terms of the physical temperature of the medicinal part of the plant, but in counter-response to what is pathogenic Fire Heat and Cold in TCM. These properties are \"The flavor of a herb is not simply about its smell and taste. It is more about the certain mechanistic actions associated with the flavors,\" Physician Yew elaborates. There are six kinds of flavors for herbs. Their corresponding mechanistic actions are as follows: - Sour (Suan): Absorbent and astringent - Bitter (Ku): Dehydrating and purging - Sweet (Tian): Nourishing, harmonizing, and moistening - Pungent (La): Dispersing and propelling - Salty (Xian): Softening and laxative - Bland (Ping Dan): Diuretic and filtrating How Medicinal Plants Are Prescribed In TCM Herbs are prescribed depending on the syndrome, body constitution, and symptoms of the patient. Physician Yew further shares that delivery propensities refer to the four different types of biomechanical actions to deliver bioactive compounds to certain parts of the body. These are: - Ascending to deliver upwards - Descending to deliver downwards - Floating to deliver outwards - Sinking to deliver inwards \"A common misconception is that although medicinal plants are natural, that doesn't mean they are free from toxicity. There is a TCM saying, 'Every herbal medicine has its toxicity,'\" reveals Physician Yew. All medicinal plants have individual levels of toxicity and potency that work to correct body imbalances for treating diseases. These are: - Non-toxic (all the plants featured in this article fall into this category) - Mildly toxic - Moderately toxic - Highly toxic Finally, each TCM herb is categorized by its meridian tropism, where each herb is perceived to have one or more inclinations toward certain meridians and specific organs.
