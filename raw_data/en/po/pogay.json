Refer to Appendix 5 for a sample of an emergency storage and handling plan. All providers must meet t he following requirement s in order to participate in the VFC Program: A. Vaccine Coordinators : Designate one staff me mber to be the primary vaccine coordinator, and at least one ba ck-up vaccine coordinator who is able to perform the vaccine storage and handling responsibilities in the event that the primary c oordinator is unavailable. These positions will be responsible for some key requirement s and will provide oversight for all vaccine management within the office. The primary and back-up vaccine coordi nators are responsible for training other staff who are responsible for administering vaccines or who may be required to transport vaccine in an emergency, following the office's vaccine storage and handling plan. The provider should keep a simple log sheet with the staff member's name and date of training. The primary vaccine coordinator and/or back-up staf f should be the VFC contacts for the office, as documented on a ll of the VFC Program forms. 1. The primary and back-up vaccine coor dinators must be responsible for the following vaccine management activities: a. Conduct a monthly vaccine inventory and monitor vaccine usage. b. Adjust the temperature of the vaccine storage unit. c. Document the temperature on the Temperature Log for Vaccines Form for each storage unit. d. The primary and back-up va ccine coordinators should monitor temperature logs when they are recording daily vaccine temperatures. e. Rotate vaccine stock by placing vaccines with shorter expiration dates in front of t hose with longer expiration dates. ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-A Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 2 f. Remove and label expired or unserviceable vaccine to avoid inadvertent administration. g. Save at least two empty shipping containers, which McKesson Specialty uses to ship vaccines, to return expired or unserviceable vaccines for excise tax credit to the centralized vaccine distributor. Providers no longer have to return empty shipping containers to McKesson Specialty. Recycle them through the lo cal recycling programs. h. Under no circumstances should providers return syringes filled but not used, syringes (with or without needles), open vials, or any multidose vial from which providers have withdrawn doses. Providers mu st dispose of these items according to usual medical biosafety procedures. i. Document expired or unserviceable vaccines on the Vaccine Return and Waste Form , the Vaccine Report Form , and the Vaccine Inventory Balance Sheet . j. Contact the VFC Program staff at (800) 483-2543 three months prior to the vaccine expiration date to arrange transfer of the vaccine. k. Store vaccines that require re frigeration in the middle of the refrigerator compartment, away from coils, walls, floor, and cold air vent. l. Store vaccines that require fr eezer storage in the middle of the freezer compartment, away from the walls and coils. m. Space vaccines to allow for cold air circulation around them. n. Label and separate private vaccines from VFC vaccines. B. Storage and Handling Plans: Providers may develop their own written routine and emergency storage and handling plans, or use the storage and handling templates for customization (see Appendix 5). 1. The routine vaccine storage and handling plan and the emergency plan should address the following aspects of vaccine management in the event of refrigerator or fr eezer malfunctions, power failures, natural disasters, or other emer gencies that might compromise appropriate vaccine storage conditions: a. Contact information of the person(s) responsible for preparing and transporting vaccine. ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-A Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 3 b. A plan on how the person re sponsible for preparing and transporting vaccine will be notifi ed that vaccine needs to be moved. c. Identify the location that will receive vaccine. d. A plan on how the receivin g location will be notified of transport. e. A plan on how to pack vaccine for transport. f. Worksheet to document va ccine impacted by power or equipment failure. g. List of primary and secondar y staff who will perform these functions. At a minimum, providers must review and update the emergency plan annually, or when t here is a change in staf f that has specific responsibilities in the emergency plan. The BOI and VFC Program staff may request a copy of t he emergency plan for review and evaluation. C. Vaccine Storage Equipment: Providers must have appropriate vaccine storage equipment that can maintain proper temperature conditions. Refrigerators or freezer s used for vaccine storage must comply with the following requirements: 1. The provider must have temper ature-monitored, alarm-equipped, stand-alone refrigerators with separate doors for freezer and refrigerator compartments. The re frigerator units should maintain the recommended temperature ranges between 35\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C) and should have a separate freezer compartment with a separate exterior door. 2. The freezer compartment should maintain an average temperature of 5\u00b0F (-15\u00b0C) or colder. A comb ination refrigerator/freezer unit sold for home use is acceptable for vaccine storage. 3. Be large enough to hold the year's largest inventory. 4. Have working thermometers (certified in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or the American Society for Testing an d Materials (ASTM) standards) placed in a central area insi de each storage compartment. ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-A Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 4 5. Be dedicated to the storage of vaccines. Food and beverages must not be stored in a vaccine storage unit because this practice results in frequent opening of the door and destabilization of the temperature. NOTE: The Florida VFC Program does not approve dormitory-style refrigerators for VFC vaccine storage . A dormitory-style refrigerator is defined as a small combination refriger ator/freezer unit that is outfitted with one external door, an evaporator plat e (cooling coil), which is usually located inside an icemaker compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator, and is void of a temperature alarm devic e. Its temperature control sensor reacts to the temperatur e of the evaporator, rather than the general air in the storage compartment. When the co mpressor is on, the evaporator cools to lower the temperature in the refrigerator, in most cases to below 0\u00b0C. D. Temperature Monitoring: Temperature moni toring should be the responsibility of the primary and back- up vaccine coordinators. If other staff must monitor temper atures, train these individuals on how to respond to and document actions taken w hen temperatures are outside the appropriate range. 1. Post a Fahrenheit or Celsius Temperature Log for Vaccines Form on the storage unit door or in a readily accessible place. 2. Record refrigerator/freezer temperatures on the Temperature Log for Vaccines Form twice a day (beginning and end), ensuring that refrigerator temperature ranges are between 35\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C). Keep the freezer temperature 5\u00b0F or lower (-15\u00b0C or colder). Monitoring and recording temperatur es twice a day is required, even if a continuous graphing/recording thermometer or a digital data logger is used. 3. Correct improper vaccine storage c onditions immediately, including inappropriate exposure to light or storage temperatures outside the recommended ranges. Document the actions taken on the Emergency Response Plan Form (Sample) (see Appendix 5). 4. Maintain and store the completed Temperature Log for Vaccines Form for three years. The BOI fiel d staff will review this form when they conduct on-site visits. 5. Monitor vaccine storage temperatures by using a minimum/maximum thermometer or continuous recording thermometer both in the refrigerator and freezer. Follow the ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-A Vaccine Management Date: June 2009 5 manufacturer's recommended schedule for recalibration of the certified thermometers. E. Vaccine Shipments: 1. Immediately check the vaccine co ld chain monitors when vaccine arrives at the office or clinic. 2. If upon the arrival of the vacci ne shipment there is a vaccine- viability concern (i.e., if the monitor is not activated or if there is damage to the package), cont act a McKesson Specialty representative at (877) 836-7123 wit hin the contractual two-hour window. 3. Develop a policy with protocol s and procedures for maintaining the vaccine cold chain during transport to off-site clinics or emergency storage locations. You can access the CDC storage and handling guidelines, Maintaining the Cold Chain During Transport, at http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3049.pdf . F. Action Plan/Vaccine Wastage: What to do if a power failure occurs, staff left the refrigerator door open, the tem perature was too cold or too hot, the refrigerator plug was pulled, or in any other situation that would cause improper storage conditions: 1. Implement written procedures for reporting and responding to vaccine losses. 2. Close the door and/or plug in the re frigerator/freezer. 3. Record the current temperature of the refr igerator/freezer on the Temperature Log for Vaccines Form . Return refrigerator/freezer to acceptable temperature ranges and monitor temperatures on an hourly basis. 4. Store the vaccines at appr opriate temperatures in a refrigerator/freezer that is worki ng properly. Do not throw out the affected vaccines. 5. Contact the manufacturer(s ) (see Appendix 5) and the VFC Program for guidance. 6. Separate the potentially comp romised vaccines to prevent inadvertent administration, and l abel with \"DO NOT USE\", until the provider receives a response from the vaccine manufacturer indicating that the vaccine is still potent. ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-A Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 6 7. Do not discard any vaccine, unle ss directed to do so by the vaccine manufacturer or the VFC Program representative. 8. If directed to discard any vacci ne, return the vaccines (except syringes that you filled but did not use, syringes (with or without needles), open vials or any multidose vial from which some doses have been withdrawn) to McKesson Specialty in the recyclable insulated vaccine containers, in wh ich the vaccines were originally shipped. 9. To ensure accountability for expired or unserviceable vaccines, document these vaccines on the Vaccine Return and Waste Form , the Vaccine Report Form , and the Vaccine Inventory Balance Sheet . 10. Fax a copy of the Vaccine Return and Waste Form to the VFC Program at (850) 245-4734. 11. Include a copy of the Vaccine Return and Waste Form with all expired or unserviceable vacci nes in the shipping container. 12. If you do not have a postage-pai d shipping label, contact a VFC Program representative at ( 800) 483-2543 to request a label. Vaccine Security and Equipment Maintenance Safeguard the electrical supply to the re frigerator and post warning notices at both the electrical outlet and the circ uit breaker to prevent accidental disconnection of power. A. Plug the refrigerator into an outlet in a restricted access area. B. Label the refrigerator, electrical outl ets, fuses, and circuit breakers on the power circuit with information that cl early identifies the perishable nature of vaccines and the immediate steps t he provider will take in case of interruption of power. Contact t he VFC Program at (800) 483-2543 to request \" DO NOT UNPLUG \" stickers. C. Limit access to the vaccine supp ly to authorized personnel only. D. Install locks on refrigerators and, if possible, the electrical plug. E. Safeguard public vaccines by provid ing facility security, such as temperature alarms and restricted access to vaccine storage and handling areas. ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-A Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 7 F. Provide a source of back-up power (generators) and a security system to alert appropriate personnel in the ev ent of a power outage. If the provider's building has auxiliary pow er, use the outlet supplied by that system. G. Test back-up generators quarterly and maintain back-up generators at least annually (check manufacturer specifications for test procedures and maintenance schedules). ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-A Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 8 Florida State Health Online Tr acking System (Florida SHOTS) The Florida SHOTS helps ensure that the required immunization records for childcare centers and school attendance are easy to locate, children's immunizations are up to date, prevent s unnecessary duplicative immunization, and consolidates immunization records from multiple healthcare providers. The benefits of the r egistry are: A. Produces the legal immunization record (DH Form 680) required for school and daycare center attendance. B.

A dormitory-style re frigerator is defined as a small combination refrigerator/freezer unit that is outfi tted with one external door, an evaporator plate (cooling coil), which is usually lo cated inside an icemaker compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator, and is vo id of a temperature alarm device. Its temperature control sensor reacts to t he temperature of t he evaporator, rather than the general air in the storage compar tment. When the compressor is on, the evaporator cools to lower the temperatur e in the refrigerator, in most cases to below 0\u00b0C. Dormitory-style refrigerators place vaccine at a high risk of freezing. These types of units cannot reliably regulate tem peratures to keep vaccines within the recommended range. Vaccine storage units should be temperature-monitored, alarm-equipped, stand-alone refrigerat ors and stand-alone freezers. Any stand-alone refrigerator or freezer used to store VFC vaccine must: Be able to maintain required vacci ne storage temperatures year-round. Be large enough to hold the year 's largest vaccine inventory. Have a certified, calibrat ed thermometer inside each storage compartment. Be dedicated to the storage of vaccines. Food and beverages must not be stored in a vaccine storage unit. No piece of vaccine storage equipment is infallible. At some point, equipment failure will occur because of a power fa ilure, breakdown, or normal wear and tear. Vaccine security requires that pr oviders should anticipate these failures, and that back-up equipment and back-up plans be available (see Appendix 5 for sample plan). Facilities storing large vaccine inventor ies may want to consider installing continuous monitoring temperature alarm systems to help prevent substantial financial loss if the temper atures in their storage uni ts exceed the recommended ranges. Even if the alarm systems are used, providers still must check and record the refrigerator and the fr eezer temperatures twice a day. Patients receiving vaccine with decreased potency caused by improper storage conditions may not be fully protected against vaccine-preventable disease. The ________________________ _____________________ ___________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-B Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 2 General Recommendations on Immunization, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), states that providers should not count mishandled vaccine doses as valid doses and providers shoul d repeat vaccination, unless serologic testing indicates a response to the vaccine. Recalling patients to repeat vaccine doses because vaccine has been stor ed improperly can damage public confidence in vaccines and in the provider's practice. Recommended Refrigerator and Freezer Temperature Range: The provider must have temperature-monitored, alarm-equipped, stand-alone refrigerators and freezers. The refrigerator units should maintain the recommended temperature ranges of 35\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C). The freezer compartment should maintain an average temperature of 5\u00b0F (-15\u00b0C) or colder. A combination refrigerator/freezer unit sold for home use is acceptable for vaccine storage. It should have a separate exterior freezer door. Store each vaccine in its proper location (see Figure 1) for the best safety margin. Store water bottles in the refrigerator and frozen packs in the freezer to stabilize the temperature. Thermometers that provide contin uous recording or minimum/maximum temperatures are preferred because they are the best indicators of temperature fluctuations outside of the recommended ranges. Adequate thermometers for monitoring temperatures are discussed in detail in Module 5-C. Opening the Door: Limit the number of times the vaccine storage unit doors are opened and avoid letting the doors stand open unnecessarily. This affects the temperature in the unit and exposes the vaccines to light (which can affect the potency of H PV, MMR, MMRV, rota virus, varicella, Store vaccine (Figure 1).________________________ _____________________ ___________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-B Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 3 and zoster vaccines). Frequently c heck the doors throughout the day to ensure they are tightly closed. Vegetable Bins: Remove the vegetable bins from the refrigerator. This will provide extra space to store c ontainers of water to stabilize the temperature. Additionally, it will elim inate the temptation to use the bins for storage of food, beverages, or vaccines. Vaccines should never be stored near the floor of t he refrigerator in the ve getable bins because the temperature in this area is differ ent from that in the body of the refrigerator. Food and Beverages: Never store food or beverages inside the vaccine refrigerator or freezer . This practice result s in frequent opening of the storage unit door and great er chance for temperature instability and excessive exposure to ligh t. It may also result in spills and contamination inside the compartment. Medications and Other Biologic Products: Other medications and biologic products should not be stored inside the vaccine stor age unit. If there is no other choice, these products must be stored bel ow the vaccines on a different shelf. This prevents contamination of the vaccines should other products spill, and reduces the likelihood of medication errors.

Certified-calibrated Thermometers The National Center for Immunizati on and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using only certified-calibrated thermometers for measuring vaccine stor age unit temperatures. Thermometers are a requirement for VF C providers. The manufacturer calibrates all thermometers during manufacturing, and gives them a temperature scale. Certified-calibrated thermometers under go a second individual calibration against a reference standard from an appropriate age ncy, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or a laboratory recognized by NIST. Calibration can be traceable to NIST us ing the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods for the calibration process. Calibrated thermometers receive a certificate indicating successful completion of this process. The provider will receive a copy of the certif icate when they purchase the instrument. This certificate is different from the m anufacturer's warranty; save this important document. Certified-calibrated thermome ters are available through laboratory and scientific supply companies (see Appendix 5). Avoid using thermometers that are not certified; a thermometer costing a few dollars is not worth the risk of damaging thousands of dollars of vaccine because of inaccurate readings. In the long run, it is better to invest in a more expensive but reliable certified-calibrated thermome ter because it is more cost-effective. Thermometers that provide contin uous recording of minimum/maximum temperatures are preferred because they are the best indicators of temperature fluctuations outside of the recommended ranges. Types of Certified-calibrated Thermometers To ensure that refrigerators and fr eezers are maintaining the proper temperatures for vaccine storage, each compartment should have a certified- calibrated thermometer and the provi der should check and record the temperature twice a day on the Temperature Log for Vaccines Form . There are several types of thermometers to monitor the temperat ures within vaccine storage units. ________________________ _____________________ Provider Handbook M-5-C Vaccine Date: June 2009 2 Certified-calibrated Thermometers Most information/ Highest cost <\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014> Least information/ Lowest cost Extent of data Continuous recording Minimum/maximum temperature reading Single point reading Types Chart recorders, electronic data loggers Fluid-filled, some digital Fluid-filled, some digital, bi-metal stem Any of the various types of thermome ters in this section are adequate for monitoring temperatures inside vaccine st orage units. However, thermometers that provide continuous recording or minimum/maximum temperatures are preferred because they are the best i ndicators of temperature fluctuations outside of the recommended ranges. Prov iders should take immediate action when the refrigerator/freezer temperat ures are out of the recommended range . A. Fluid-filled Biosafe Liquid Thermometers Fluid-filled biosafe liquid (bottle) thermometers consist of two parts: 1. The first part is a glass bulb connected to a glass tube, with a numbered scale printed along the tube. Inside the tube is a liquid (usually mercury or colored alcohol) that rises and falls as the temperature changes in the immediate area of the bulb. 2. The second part is a bottle containing a biosafe liquid, such as glycol. The glass bulb is immersed in the liquid. The liquid provides a buffer around the bulb, so that the reading does not fluctuate when the providers open or close the refrigerator or freezer door. Fluid-filled biosafe liquid thermometers are available in refrigerator and in freezer models. Some models may come with a magnet designed to attach the thermometer to the refrigerat or or freezer wall. This is not the correct placement for a thermometer used in vaccine storage. Place the thermo meter in the center of the refrigerator/freezer compar tment with the vaccine. Fluid-filled biosafe liquid thermometers can be difficult to read and can render inaccurate temperatures if the liquid column separates. This may be correctable; consult the manufactu rer for detailed in structions for reuniting the liquid Fluid-filled Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 3 B. Minimum/Maximum and Digital Thermometers Minimum/maximum thermometers are available in fluid-filled and digital forms . They show the current temperature and the minimum and maximum temperatures achieved. Providers can detect temperature fluctuations outside the recommended range by referring to the minimum and maximum temperature readings. Digital thermometers display Fahrenheit and/or Celsius temperatures on a screen. Some have optional features, including a display of the mini mum and maximum temperatures, a temperature alarm that can be set to ri ng at a specified te mperature, or a temperature probe. Minimum/maximum digital thermometer. Digital thermometer with standard probe. Digital thermometer with biosafe liquid-encased probe. C. Digital Data Loggers Digital data loggers are miniature, ba ttery-operated, electronic devices programmed to record temperatures at intervals throughout the day, with the frequency of reading set by the user. They are capable of recording hundreds or even thousands of indi vidual temperature readings. Digital data loggers come with special software, which providers install on a computer. This software allows t he user to set the frequency of the temperature readings, download data from the device, and calculate temperature averages, minimums, and maxi mums. In order to review the temperature history, the user must download data from the digital data logger on a regular basis. Providers must manually check and record temperatures twice a day. They can also use a second certified thermometer for these m anual temperature checks. Some data loggers may have an audible al arm to alert the user to out-of- range temperature conditions. Other data loggers may have external Minimum/maximum Thermometers. ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-C Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 4 lights that alert the user to out-of -range temperature event s; a green light indicates temperatures have remained in range and a red light indicates temperatures are out of range. If a data logger's alarm activates or displays a red light, follow the action plan outlined in Module 5-A. Providers may also use digital data loggers in vaccine transport. D. Chart Temperature Recorders Chart recorders consist of a graph wheel with replaceable graph paper and ink pens. The pens mark t he temperature on the graph paper continually as the wheel turns. The graph paper has a Fahrenheit or Celsius scale on it and the temperature is read where the ink line falls on the scale. Providers should change the graph paper when it completes a full circle, usually weekly, and record the date on the graph paper when they remove/change the graph paper. Providers should keep old graphs as a permanent record of the per formance of the vaccine storage unit. In a certified chart recorder, the ce rtification applies only to the temperature sensor used by the recording pen. Providers should record only the spec ific reading from the graphing wheel when they check the temperatures t wice a day. Some chart recorders have temperature probes. Probes are available in two forms: a standard probe and a biosafe liquid-encased pr obe. Place the biosafe liquid- encased probes in the center of the compartment and suspend the standard probes. Chart recorders are more difficult to read than digital thermometers because they require interpretation of the temperature graph. These are the only thermometers that record t he current temperat ure, the minimum and maximum temperatures, and the c ontinuous changes in temperature through time. Providers can detect te mperature fluctuations outside the recommended ranges by referring to the minimum and maximum temperature readings. Chart recorder. Graph paper\u2014 two-degree increments. Date: June 2009 5 E. Bi-metal Stem Thermometers Bi-metal stem thermometers are typically circular in shape, with a needle anchored in the center that points to one or two numbered scales (Fahrenheit and/or Celsius) located around the perimeter of the dial . The temperature is indicated by where the needle points on the scale. These thermometers may be difficult to read. When reading the thermometer, the face should be vertical and your eyes should be level with the center of the dial. Certified bi -metal stem thermometers are quite accurate, but they only indicate the tem perature at the time they are read. They do not indicate the changes in temperature over time or the minimum/maximum temperatures achiev ed. Therefore, providers may not detect temperature fluctuati ons outside the recommended range. F. Other Thermometers\u2014NOT RECOMMENDED Do not use thermometers that are not certified-calibrated thermometers. Uncertified thermomete rs or dial-type household refrigerator/freezer thermometers are not accurate enough to risk losing expensive vaccine. Generally, the rmometers obtained in hardware and appliance stores are not certified in struments. These thermometers monitor temperatures fo r domestic food storage. Thermometer Placement Place the thermometer in the center of the compartment, away from the coils, walls, floor, and fan, in order to obtai n a true reading of the temperature (see Figure 2). Fluid-filled biosafe liquid thermometer in freezer. Chart recorder in refrigerator. Proper placement of thermometers in compartments (Figure 2). Bi-metal stem thermometer. ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-C Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 6 In the refrigerator, place the thermome ter on the middle shelf, adjacent to the vaccine, or hanging down fr om the upper shelf. In the freezer, suspend the thermometer from the ceil ing of the compartment or place on a box or some other item, so that it is in the middle of the compartm ent, off the floor. If the thermometer indicates a temperature outside the recommended range, check that the thermometer is appropriately situated. Thermometer Maintenance and Recertification Certified-calibrated thermome ters require periodic recert ification and recalibration in order to remain accurate. Contact the manufacturer for instructions regarding recalibration procedures. When choosing a certified-calibrated thermometer, consider the cost and frequen cy of required recalibration. Recalibration costs will vary by manufacturer, model, and type of thermometer. Keep documentation of recertification and recalibration as part of the office records. The National Center for Immunizati on and Respiratory Diseases recommends adhering to the recalibration schedule recommended by the manufacturer. ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-D Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 1 MODULE 5-D - Vaccine Storage and Handling: Vaccine Transfers Vaccine transfers between providers can o ccur only after receiving approval from a VFC Program representativ e. A VFC provider may transfer a vaccine to another VFC provider within three months of the expiration date. Do not transfer opened vials. It is the prov ider's responsibility to ship or transfer the vaccine safely and correctly. If the cold chain is broken and the vaccine becomes unserviceable, the VFC Program may c harge providers for the cost of the vaccine.

When the providers transport vaccines from their clinic to another location they should follow proper vaccine transportati on procedures to ensure protection of the vaccine supply. To facilitate mass i mmunization clinics at these locations, the VFC Program is allowin g providers to transport vaccines that are required for school and child care only . Providers should complete and fax the Special Vaccine Order Form for Off- Site Immunization Activities (Appendix 4) to the VFC Program at (850) 245- 4734, 2 to 3 weeks prior to the planned sch ool immunization activity. This will allow sufficient time for the VFC Pr ogram to process, and for McKesson Specialty to deliver the vaccine. This fo rm is also available on our website at http://www.immunizeflor ida.org/vfc/forms.htm . Healthcare providers and staff are res ponsible for maintaining vaccine quality from the time a shipment arrives unt il the moment they administer a vaccine dose. The following are general guidelines for packing vaccine when transporting to off-site acti vities like health fairs and immunization clinics: A. Use properly insulated containers to transport vaccine. The individual responsible to transport the vaccines should ensure these containers are capable of maintaining the vaccine at the correct temperatures. The provider may use the shipping contai ners the vaccines arrived in from McKesson Specialty. Al ternatively, the provider may use hard-sided plastic insulated contai ners or Styrofoam cooler s with at least 2-inch thick walls. Thin-walled Styrofoam coolers, such as those purchased at grocery stores to hol d beverages, are not acceptable. B. Pack enough refrigerated/frozen packs to maintain the cold chain. Do not use loose or bagged ice. The number and placement of refrigerated/frozen packs inside the container will depend on container size and outside temperature. C. Pack vaccines in their original pack aging. Do not remove vaccine vials from boxes, and do not draw up vaccine in advance. D. Use a properly placed thermometer near the vaccine but not in contact with the frozen packs. ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-E Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 2 E. In hot climates and summer seasons, keep the insulated containers in the air-conditioned interior of the car duri ng transport, rather than in the trunk. Refrigerated/frozen packs. Place bubble wrap, crumpled brown packing paper, or Styrofoam peanuts between the refrigerated/frozen packs and the vaccines . Place a thermometer next to the vaccine but not in contact with the refrigerated/frozen packs. Label the outside of the cooler containers to clearly identify the contents as being valuable and fragile vaccines. Below are some examples of labels the provider can attach to the coolers. What to do After the Off-s ite Activity is Over The designated staff will unpack, check, and immediately stor e the vaccines at the recommended temperature r anges of 35\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C); and the freezer temperature of 5\u00b0F (-15\u00b0C) or colder when they return to the clinic from the off- site activity. The designated staff will fax a copy of the Cooler Temperature Log (Appendix 4) to the VFC Program at (850) 245-4734. If the designated staff has suspic ion of a cold chain failure or evidence of vaccine exposure to temperatures outside the recommended temperatur e range, the staff should immediately notify the primary vacci ne coordinator. If the primary vaccine coordinator is not available, the staff should report the problem to the immediate supervisor. The designated staff, t he primary vaccine coordinator, or the immediate supervisor should follow these steps: ________________________ _____________________ ____________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook M-5-E Vaccine Management Revision Date: June 2009 3 A. Store the potentially compromised vaccines under appropriate conditions in a properly functioning refrigerator/freezer. B. Separate the potentially compro mised vaccines, and label \"DO NOT USE\", to prevent inadvertent adm inistration, until the vaccine manufacturer(s) determine the integr ity and potency of the vaccines. C. Contact the manufacturer(s) and the VFC Program for guidance. D. Do not discard any vaccine unless directed to do so by the vaccine manufacturer(s) or the VFC Program staff. E. If the vaccine becomes unserviceabl e, account for these doses on the Vaccine Return and Waste Form and follow the VFC Program vaccine return procedures (see Module 5-D). ________________________ __________________ _______________________ Florida VFC Provider Handbook Revision Date: June 2009 This page is intentionally left blank.
