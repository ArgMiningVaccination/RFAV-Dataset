She answered all my questions as well as answering my energetic 11-year-old's questions about what he could do. - Dr. Burton is fabulous! She is thorough in everything she does and is great with kids. My daughter is 13 years old and is completely comfortable with Dr. Burton. Dr. Burton explains things well so that my daughter understands what is going on regarding the diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Burton is very professional yet very approachable - I HIGHLY recommend her! - While home from school, we wanted our child to see another doctor for a persistent problem. The appointment desk was fantastic and we had a convenient nighttime appointment. As a new patient, Dr. Burton, greeted my daughter and talked directly to her. She was professional, patient, kind, and knowledgable. Although, our child would be returning to school, and seeing a doctor there, Dr. Burton treated her as if she was a long term patient. She gave her recommendations and referred and arranged for her to go to Physical Therapy all within the same week. We were very impressed with her and would definitely see her again. - Dr. Burton is fantastic, she has taken care of my son's broken bones several times. She has a special way of connecting with her patients and is very very approachable. Don't let her young appearance fool you, it is clear that she has a wealth of knowledge. As a health care provider myself I felt very comfortable with her high level of expertise and plain \"good old fashion\" advise. Dr. Burton will go above and beyond to take care of your kids needs and make him/her feel special and taken care of. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2022 Seattle Magazine 2022 C.
