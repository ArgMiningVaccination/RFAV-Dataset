Sciatica refers to pain that begins in the lower back and travels down the lower limbs traversing the root of the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the human body. It marks its beginning in the lower back and runs down the hips, back of legs, and down to the feet. There is one sciatic nerve on either side of the body and any one of them may be involved when pain is experienced. Irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve leads to sciatica pain. Homeopathy is a very advanced science fully equipped to treat neuralgic pains, including sciatica pain. Homeopathic medicines can treat acute as well as chronic sciatica pain. Homeopathic medicines, which are natural and safe, work on the root cause of sciatica for complete, effective healing and cure. What causes sciatica pain? The causes of sciatica pain could be many, but the main among these are pinching compression, or irritation of the sciatic nerve. This pinching or compression may result from a disc bulge or a [herniated disc](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/herniated-disc) in the lower spine. Other causes of sciatic nerve compression are degeneration of the spinal disc, stenosis (narrowing) of the spinal canal, bone spurs, spondylolisthesis (dislocated vertebra), piriformis syndrome and compression of the sciatic nerve from a tumor in the spine. Sings & Symptoms of Sciatica Pain? Pain in the lower back that radiates down either leg clinically signifies that you have sciatica.
