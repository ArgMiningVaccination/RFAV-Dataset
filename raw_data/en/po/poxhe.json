Despite this, there is no definitive treatment for it yet. This study aims to evaluate the studies on single and combined herbal interventions affecting COPD. Design/methodology/approach In this study, all articles published in English up to 2020 were extracted from the Web of Science (WoS) database and collected using Boolean tools based on keywords, titles and abstracts. Finally, the data required for bibliographic analysis, such as the author(s), publication year, academic journal, institution, country of origin, institution, financial institution and keywords were extracted from the database. Findings A total of 573 articles were analyzed. The number of papers in the lung disease field showed an upward trend from 1984 to 2021, and there was a surge in paper publications in 2013. China, Korea and Brazil published the highest number of studies on COPD, and Chinese medical universities published the most papers. Three journals that received the highest scores in this study were the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, International Immunopharmacology and Plos One. In the cloud map, expression, activation and expression were the most frequently researched subjects. In the plus and author keywords, acute lung injury was the most commonly used word. Inflammation, expression of various genes, nitric oxide-dependent pathways, NFkappa B, underlying COPD. Scientometric analysis of COPD provides a vision for future research and policymaking. Originality/value This study aimed to evaluate the studies on single and combined herbal interventions affecting COPD. Keywords S.G-D, M.B, E.SS: Visualization, Validation. All authors have read and approved the final manuscript. Ethical approval: This article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.
