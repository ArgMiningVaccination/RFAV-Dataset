We [report]interim Phase 3 study (NCT05007951) results to 4 weeks post- [dose]2 in [adults]was conducted in Cohort1 1,895 subjects (naive to COVID-19 [vaccination]and [infection]) randomized at ratio (GBP510/AS03ChAdOx1-S) to assess immunogenicity and [safety];Cohort 2 2,141 subjects at 51 ratio, regardless of their serostatus at [screening]for [safety]assessment. Subjects were vaccinated twice at a 4-week interval with 0.5 mL of the test [vaccine](GBP510/AS03) or active control (ChAdOx1-S) in [deltoid muscle]. The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of geometric mean titer (GMT) and non-inferiority in the two groups (Test [vaccine]/Active control) was 2.93 [95% CI 2.63, 3.27], satisfying the hypothesis of superiority (95% CI lower limit> 1). The SCR difference (Test [vaccine]- Active control) was 10.76% [95% CI 7.68, 14.32], satisfying the hypothesis of AE [incidence rate]for the test [vaccine]was higher than the active control for solicited local AEs (56.69% vs 49.20%), and comparable for solicited systemic AEs (51.21% vs 53.51%) and unsolicited AEs (13.34% vs 14.66%) [vaccination]. Higher GBP510/AS03 showed a clinically acceptable [safety]profile;no [safety]concerns were the study period. [Copyright]\u00a9 Dispon\u00edvel de documento: Artigo Similares MEDLINE ... LILACS LIS "}
