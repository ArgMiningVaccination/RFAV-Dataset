The effects of complementary aromatherapy on CINV are documented, but more information is needed to implement practice changes. Objectives: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether pure peppermint or ginger essential oil reduced the severity of CINV. Methods: A controlled randomized pilot study was conducted using peppermint oil, ginger oil, and control (canola oil) groups. Nurses applied the assigned oil every four hours. Outcome and patient feedback data were collected. Findings: Twenty patients experienced a level 2 or greater nausea event. Patients in the peppermint oil group were the least likely to experience a nausea event, followed by the ginger oil and control groups. Five patients experienced level 2 vomiting; these events did not differ between groups. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) can result in metabolic imbalances, the degeneration of self-care and functional ability, nutrient depletion, anorexia, a decline in the patient's performance and mental status (Berger et al., 2017), and, ultimately, nonadherence to the chemotherapy regimen, leading to poor patient outcomes. CINV can be a significant burden on patients undergoing blood and marrow transplantation (BMT). Patients undergoing BMT receive high-dose chemotherapy in preparation for transplantation. Although these regimens include antiemetics, patients may experience acute or delayed CINV. Autologous stem cell transplantation is a procedure in which a patient's healthy stem cells are collected from the blood or bone marrow before treatment, stored, and then given back to the patient after treatment with radiation therapy or high-dose chemotherapy to replace destroyed stem cells (National Cancer Institute, n.d.). Two frequently used regimens for autologous or without rituximab (BEAM+/-R). According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023), these regimens have a moderate (30%-90% frequency of emesis) to high emetic risk (more than 90% frequency of emesis) (Berger et al., 2017). The use of aromatherapy in oncology settings has been found to enhance quality of life in patients with cancer and control other side effects and symptoms of the disease (Renata, 2012; Toniolo et al., 2021). A systematic literature review found that inhaled peppermint and ginger essential oils alleviated CINV in various populations of patients with cancer (Toniolo et al., 2021). For patients with breast cancer experiencing CINV, inhaled ginger essential oil can reduce the incidence of CINV, increase health-related quality of life, and increase dietary intake (Lua et al., 2015; Salihah et al., 2016). In a study of patients receiving chemotherapy, patients used inhaled ginger essential oil or a placebo of a ginger fragrance instilled in a necklace placed 20 cm from their nostrils for five days. The results did not demonstrate that inhaled ginger essential oil was an effective complementary therapy for CINV. However, the findings related to quality of life were encouraging, with significant improvement reported in several domains following the intervention, including global health status, role functioning, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, appetite, and constipation (Lua et al., 2015). In addition, dietary intake improved in patients with breast cancer who rotated cycles of inhaling ginger essential oil and ginger fragrant oil via a necklace separated by two weeks in between chemotherapy cycles (Salihah et al., 2016). In another study, patients with cancer received oral spearmint essential oil, oral peppermint essential oil, a placebo, or standard care (control). During the acute phase of the study, patients receiving essential oils experienced fewer emetic events compared to patients treated with placebo. The intensity of nausea was also reduced within these same groups, regardless of which essential oil was administered (Tayarani-Najaran et al., 2013). Similar results were found with the use of peppermint essential oil in other studies of patients with cancer (Ert\u00fcrk & Taci, 2021; Mapp et al., 2020). The current pilot study evaluated whether pure peppermint or ginger essential oil reduced the severity of CINV in the autologous BMT population. A secondary purpose was to evaluate patients' responses to the study procedures and satisfaction with the route of delivery of the essential oils. This controlled randomized pilot study allocated patients into three groups. In the three groups, 21 patients received 100% pure ginger essential oil, 20 patients received 100% pure peppermint essential oil, and 19 patients in the control group received canola oil. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio using a block (block size = 6) randomization program in SAS, version 9.4. Randomization was stratified based on patients' prior history of CINV because it may have been an indicator that would have affected study outcomes. The Nursing Research and Evidence-Based Practice Council at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa, Florida, approved the study. Approval was also obtained from the Scientific Review Committee at Moffitt Cancer Center, as well as the Advarra Institutional Review Board. The study was conducted on the BMT unit at Moffitt Cancer Center. Patients who were admitted for BMT received high-dose chemotherapy, biotherapy, or radiation therapy protocols, followed by the administration of autologous or allogeneic blood or marrow hematopoietic stem cells. Other treatments performed included toxicity management, neutropenic fever protocol, and treatment for post-transplantation complications, such as acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing autologous BMT who were admitted within nine hours of receiving melphalan or BEAM+/-R protocols and were able to read and understand English. Exclusion criteria were patients who were admitted for any other autologous regimen, allogenic transplantation, or cellular immunotherapy; could not read and/or understand English; or reported an allergy or other contraindication to essential oils. Stem cells are reinfused on day 0 for patients undergoing autologous BMT. Prior to transplantation, chemotherapy is administered on negative days leading up to day 0 (e.g., day -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, +1). The standard-of-care chemotherapy and antiemetics used in this study were as follows: (a) melphalan in combination with 24 mg ondansetron and 18 mg dexamethasone on days -2 and -1, with melphalan infused on day -2 and (b) BEAM+/-R, in combination with 24 mg ondansetron and 18 mg dexamethasone on days -6 to -1, with carmustine infused on day -6, etoposide and cytarabine infused on days -5 through -2, and melphalan infused on day -1. If the patient was administered rituximab, it was administered on day +1 and day +8; antiemetics are not administered with rituximab. Demographic and clinical characteristics collected included age, biologic gender, race, diagnosis, regimen, prior essential oil use, and prior history of CINV. The primary dependent variable in this study was the incidence and severity of CINV, and a secondary dependent variable was patient satisfaction. The independent variable was the assigned essential oil group: peppermint, ginger, or canola oil (control). Inhalation of essential oils can quickly result in desired outcomes, such as decreased nausea and vomiting (Reis & Jones, 2017). A simple method of inhalation includes putting a drop or two of oil on a tissue and breathing in the aroma (Reis & Jones, 2017). Peppermint and ginger essential oils were provided by dTERRA in Pleasant Grove, Utah, free of charge. Quality control certificates of analysis were provided by dTERRA. As described by the manufacturer, the certificates indicate that the oils met product specifications and were pure and free from contaminants, fillers, or adulteration (dTERRA, 2022c). The control canola oil was purchased at a local supermarket. According to the manufacturer, peppermint and ginger essential oils may cause skin sensitivity. Consumers should avoid contact with eyes, inner ears, and sensitive areas, and consult their physician if they are pregnant, nursing, or under a doctor's care (dTERRA, 2022a, 2022b). Patients who fit the inclusion criteria were approached about participation by the investigators who then provided details about the study. Patients were asked whether they were allergic to any essential oils or fragrances. After obtaining signed consent from interested participants, the investigators randomized the participants according to the randomization sequence. The principal investigator labeled the essential oil bottles as follows: A = peppermint oil, B = ginger oil, C = canola oil (control). Participants were not told which oil they were receiving. In a locked medication preparation room, the RN added one to two drops, as tolerated, of the assigned essential oil or control oil using a dropper on nonsterile 2-by-2 gauze. The RN pinned the gauze to the patient's gown 20 cm from the nostrils to allow for consistent inhalation among study participants. The frequency and mode of application selected for this study was previously described by Lua et al. (2015). New gauze with one to two new drops of essential oil or control oil was provided every 4 hours, 24 hours per day through day +3 for participants receiving melphalan and through day +4 for participants receiving BEAM+/-R. The end dates, representing five days after the completion of chemotherapy, allowed for any delayed nausea response experienced by the participants. Salihah et al. (2016) and Lua et al. (2015) also used a five-day intervention period. Patient feedback was collected upon study completion. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, were used to assess CINV among participants every 12 hours after the start of study until study completion (i.e., day 5 after completion of chemotherapy) (National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 2017). Use of breakthrough pro re nata medication, intensity of nausea, and vital signs were assessed every 4 hours (24 hours per day) from the start of the study until study completion. Nausea intensity was rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (no nausea) to 10 (worst possible nausea). This scale was used because of its ease of use, reliability for the patient, and consistency of data collection. Investigator-developed tools were created to capture demographic and clinical characteristics and patient feedback. Patient feedback data included ratings for satisfaction with the fragrance, subjective impression of the essential oils in helping to control CINV, and satisfaction with the route of delivery on a scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). All RNs on the unit were trained on the study protocol and procedures. Training occurred during staff meetings and daily huddles and included training on the study methods, use of the data collection tools, and storage of the essential oils/control oil. Characteristics of the sample are described using means and SDs for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. The primary outcome variable was CINV severity as defined by CTCAE grading. Nausea or vomiting events were characterized by any CTCAE grading of 2 or greater during the study period. These events were compared between groups (less than grade 2 versus grade 2 or greater) using chi-square tests, with a nominal alpha of 0.05. Patient feedback data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test for continuous items. Patients were randomly assigned to groups, with 21 assigned to ginger oil, 20 assigned to peppermint oil, and 19 assigned to the control group, which received canola oil. The majority of patients were female (n = 36) and White (n = 47). The most common cancer diagnosis was multiple myeloma (n = 37), and the most common treatment was melphalan (n = 37). More than half (n = 33) of the patients had previous experience with CINV, and 25 had previously used essential oils. Twenty patients experienced a grade 2 or greater CTCAE nausea event during the study period. Patients receiving peppermint oil experienced the lowest rate of nausea (n = 3), followed by patients receiving ginger oil (n = 7) and patients receiving canola oil (n = 10) (p = 0.045). When compared as combined intervention groups versus the control group, the results were similar, with a p value of 0.042 (see Figure 1). Only five patients experienced a grade 2 vomiting event according to the CTCAE. Patients who experienced vomiting were spread across the three groups (n = 2 in the peppermint oil and control groups, respectively, and n = 1 in the ginger oil group). These differences were not statistically significant. Univariate associations with the intervention are presented in Table 1. The patients' experiences with using essential oils were assessed using self-report and rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Although not statistically significant, mean scores on how pleasing/tolerable patients found the essential oil were lowest in the peppermint oil group (mean = 2.74) compared to the ginger oil (mean = 3.27) and control (mean = 3.33) groups (p = 0.329). The same pattern was observed for patients' satisfaction with the route of delivery (mean = 3.05 in the peppermint oil group, 3.33 in the ginger oil group, and 4 in the control group, p = 0.05). Six patients (n = 4 in the peppermint oil group and n = 2 in the ginger oil group) made subjective comments indicating that the scent was too strong and may have increased their nausea. Of these patients, five withdrew early from the study, which may have led to an increased withdrawal rate for the essential oil groups. No other side effects or complaints were reported. The number of patients who completed the study (without early withdrawal) was 17 for the control group, 15 for the ginger oil group, and 12 for the peppermint oil group (p = 0.12). Potential confounders of the relationship between essential oils and CINV included the chemotherapy regimen, which may have influenced the severity of CINV, and prior essential oil use, which may have influenced patient expectations about the benefits of using essential oils. Treatment regimens were evenly spread across the groups, with melphalan being the primary treatment (n = 13 in the peppermint oil group and n = 12 in the ginger oil and control groups). Patients in the essential oil groups were more likely to have had prior experience with essential oils (n = 13 in the ginger oil group, n = 9 in the peppermint oil group, and n = 3 in the control group, p = 0.011). All patient and outcome summary data by assigned group are presented in Table 2. Consistent with results reported in the literature, this study's results indicate that patients undergoing BMT may benefit from the inhalation of pure essential oils to decrease the severity of CINV. A systematic review of studies using inhaled aromatherapy to reduce the severity of CINV found that inhaled peppermint and ginger essential oils were effective in various populations of patients with cancer (Toniolo et al., 2021). The results of the current study on the effects of essential oils in reducing the intensity of nausea, vomiting, and retching are also similar to that of other studies (Ert\u00fcrk & Taci, 2021; Mapp et al., 2020). In contrast, one study found that ginger essential oil improved anxiety and fatigue but not nausea for patients with cancer (Williams et al., 2022). In the current study, peppermint oil was the most effective in reducing CINV severity. In the studies reviewed, inhalation was the most common administration method (Ert\u00fcrk & Taci, Mapp et 2013; Toniolo et al., 2021). For example, the application of peppermint oil three times per day for five days following chemotherapy administration reduced the frequency of nausea, vomiting, and retching; feelings of distress caused by these symptoms; and severity of nausea (Ert\u00fcrk & Taci, 2021). In the present study, some patients experienced enhanced nausea attributed to the smell of the oil and were unable to tolerate continuous inhalation for the duration of the study. As a result, the essential oil dosage was reduced to one to two drops from the three to four drops in the initial protocol. This improved tolerance and completion of the study. Although side effects from the inhalation of essential oils are rare, exposure to essential oil vapors may be aversive to patients (Manion & Widder, 2017). Intermittent inhalation of essential oils may be a more effective administration method and was the most common administration method in various studies (Dyer et al., 2016; Hodge et al., 2014; Kreye et al., 2022; Li et al., 2018; Mapp et al., 2020; Marsh et al., al., 2019; Toniolo et al., 2021; Totmaj et al., 2019). Inhalation of blended essential oils may be more tolerable than the use of a single essential oil (Brown et al., 2018). Different combinations of lavender, peppermint, ginger, spearmint, cardamom, eucalyptus, lemon, and/or orange essential oils have been used in the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting (Brown et al., 2018; Dyer et al., 2014; Hodge et al., 2014; Marsh et al., 2022). There is a paucity of research on the use of blended essential oils in cancer populations. One study of patients with cancer found that nausea was the most common reason for the use of the following two blended aromasticks formations: peppermint, ginger, and lavender; and eucalyptus and lemon (Dyer et al., 2014). Studies in the postoperative patient population have shown that blended essential oils may prevent and decrease postoperative nausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics, and nursing time and costs, and prevent discharge delays related to nausea and vomiting (Brown et al., 2018; Marsh et al., 2022). Only patients admitted for inpatient autologous BMT were included in this study. Outpatients who were undergoing BMT or any patients readmitted to the inpatient BMT unit during the study time frame were not included. Similar to other pilot studies, the sample size was small and further complicated when patients transitioned to outpatient settings to continue treatment. Although patients were randomized to clinical conditions, the relatively small sample sizes of the patient groups allowed for some imbalance in key study variables. The most notable was prior use of essential oils, which was higher in patients randomly assigned to an essential oil group. Reasons for prior use of essential oils were not explored, so the results may have been affected by patient expectations. This pilot study did not have the sample size required for a rigorous randomized controlled trial. Larger sample sizes in future studies would allow for control of multiple comparisons, increase the statistical power to detect differences in rare occurrences like vomiting, and decrease the likelihood of imbalance on key variables that may influence outcomes. This study took place at one National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center and may not be generalizable outside of the BMT unit or in other clinical settings. Essential oils may complement pharmacologic antiemetic regimens to prevent and treat CINV, improving the quality of care and patient-centered experiences in the BMT population. Aromatherapy may be a promising, inexpensive, noninvasive treatment for CINV that patients undergoing BMT can administer and control as needed. Nurse-driven protocols for the use of essential oils and advocacy for insurance coverage in symptom management warrant exploration. Patient satisfaction with the use of essential oils (e.g., fragrance, route of delivery) can be considered when determining the frequency and method of administration. Future studies can evaluate the effects of aromatherapy on additional symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, patient safety, the economic implications of the cost of supplies, and the use of antiemetic medication in the BMT population. Other essential oils with the potential to alleviate nausea and vomiting, such as lemon (Kreye et al., 2022), also warrant further exploration. Future studies are needed to examine the use of blended essential oils in the BMT population, as well as intermittent use of essential oils in general. Larger and more diverse samples are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of essential oils in other populations of interest. Essential oils offer a complementary option for patients undergoing BMT. Based on the results of this study, the use of pure peppermint and ginger essential oils can decrease CINV in this patient population. Knowledge of the emetogenic properties of the chemotherapy regimen allows nurses to advocate for preventive care and symptom management related to acute and delayed CINV with nonpharmacologic complementary interventions. Additional research in CINV management using essential oils, including administration techniques, other scents, and the use of blended essential oils in the cancer population, is needed to ensure quality holistic care.
