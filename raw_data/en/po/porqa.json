[Jheng-Yan Wu,](https://www.instagram.com/olddriverwu/) a dietitian hailing from Taiwan, has been actively involved with Cochrane since 2018, when he first encountered the principles of evidence-based medicine and Cochrane's work. Their dedication led them to become a Cochrane Supporter in 2021 by translating evidence from English to Traditional Chinese. In 2022, Wu embarked on a personal challenge of learning about the methodology behind systematic reviews and conducting meta-analyses. He fully immersed himself in the [Cochrane Handbook](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook), diligently absorbing valuable techniques along the way. The commitment was so profound that he decided to get [the Cochrane logo on his arm as a cherished tattoo](https://www.cochrane.org/news/inked-knowledge-cochrane-logo-tattoo-reflects-dedication-evidence-based-healthcare), serving as a constant reminder to apply his acquired knowledge in clinical practice. This act symbolizes his unwavering passion and aspiration to one day publish in the prestigious Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Karina Tapinova, discovered Cochrane during her medical school courses on pharmacology and epidemiology and began using Cochrane Reviews to uncover evidence on commonly used medical products in her country, Kazakhstan. To her surprise, she learned that many home remedies relied on by her family and local clinicians had no scientific evidence of benefit to support their use. After completing her studies, she began working as a research assistant at her university and is now responsible for writing systematic reviews. As Karina delved deeper into the Cochrane Collaboration, having completed its [interactive modules,](https://training.cochrane.org/interactivelearning) using the [Cochrane Handbook](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook), and participating in educational webinars, she became a volunteer translator for [ Cochrane Russia](https://russia.cochrane.org/) and took on tasks through [Cochrane Crowd](https://crowd.cochrane.org/), which greatly expanded her knowledge. In summer 2022, Karina was fortunate to participate in the [US Cochrane Mentorship program](https://us.cochrane.org/mentoring) - a wonderful opportunity that she never could have imagined during her medical school days. As a mentee of Cochrane Russia, she began working on translating into Russian and recording Cochrane podcasts with her husband, Eugene, and as of 2023, she started editing translations of the Plain Language Summaries of Cochrane Reviews, prepared by volunteer translators. Karina is also currently involved in organizing international webinars. To her, the Cochrane Collaboration represents not only a gold standard of systematic reviews, but also a community of incredible people, opportunities for growth, and personal development.
