MAXWELL J. MEHLMAN* In contemplating the technologies emerging from the Human Genome Project, nothing scares people more th an the prospect that we will attempt to use genetic engineering to control the human evolutionary process. Of course, humans, like other spec ies that reproduce sexually,1 have always engaged in a variety of reproductive be haviors that shape their evolution, such as mating along hierarchical lines, courtship rituals, and the abandonment of defective offspring. But advances in medicine and human genetics have expanded these reproductive behaviors through the introduction of powerful new tools, including computerized dating services; assisted reproductive techniques that use gametes (eggs and/or sperm) from donors chosen for their desirable genetic characteristics or other traits; in vitro fertilization and preimplantation ge netic diagnosis to weed out embryos with undesirable genetic characteristic s; abortion following prenatal genetic testing; and health care and social su pport for persons with disabilities that help them survive and reproduce.2 In all of these cases, specific sets of * Maxwell Mehlman is the Arthur E.

These reproductive behaviors are forms of germline geneti c engineering because they influence the genes that will be passed on to futu re generations, and they collectively have a gradual impact on the evolutio nary make-up of the human species. New technologies affecting human evolution are proliferating in the aftermath of the Human Genome Project. Researchers are searching for genes that are not only associated with disease, but also with traits such as eye color, freckling, baldness, memory, lo ngevity, height, hair thickness, hair color, measures of intelligence, avoidance of errors, and muscle performance. 3 As tests for more of these traits are developed, parents will be able to incorporate the tests into preimplantation genetic diagnoses and implant the embryos that have the best available genomes.4 Similar genetic testing could be performed in utero and lead to the abortion of fetuses with undesirable non-disease genetic charac teristics. Somatic interventions made possible by our growing understanding of human genetics, that is, interventions that do not directly a f f e c t e g g s o r s p e r m , w i l l i m p r o v e reproductive fitness by decreasing the scourge of illness and, in the case of changes in non-disease characteristics, enable those persons with access to the interventions to improve their socioeconomic environments. But by far the greatest impact on human evolution may result from germline genetic engineering\u2014the insert ion and deletion of genes into DNA in not only somatic cells, but in reproductive cells where the genes can be transmitted to succeeding generations. The results of these technologies are likely to be of a different order than pr evious genetic interventions. As Emily Marden and Dorothy Nelkin explain, germline genetic engineering is far more radical and controversial than earlier gene therapy protocols. Somatic cell gene therapy, the prevailing technique to date, aims to replace flawed genes in already developed individuals and is targeted to particular classes of cells. Under this technology there is negligible r isk that germ cells will be affected and that the trait will be passed on to progeny. However, in the case of germline genetic manipulation, it is expected that the procedure will affect the foetus' germ cells. Scientists could therefore potentially \"correct\" a genetic deficiency in every embryo, thereby permanently eliminating the undesirable trait from fu ture generations.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2009] WILL DIRECTED EVOLUTION DESTROY HUMANITY? 95 though, the transferred genes could ca use deleterious mutations that could also be passed on to progeny.5 Moreover, there are fewer biological boundaries when it comes to germline manipulations. As Stuart Newman observes, modification of the early embryo, referred to in what follows as \"developmental\" modification or manipulation, is unlike manipulations of the fully formed individual, including provision of artificial limbs, heart valve and joint replacements, cosmetic surger y, and even \"somatic\" (differentiated body cell) gene therapy. Developmental modification changes the generative trajectory of the individual and turns it into something intrinsically different from what it would have become without the manipulation. With these procedures there is no guarant ee that even the original species- character will be maintained. Although one objective in applying such methods to our own species may be to fabricate improved humans, in some cases, by accident or by intent, the outcomes will be quasi-human or less than human. 6 As far as it is known, no one has yet set out intentionally to perform germline genetic engineering in humans.7 However, germline changes have been produced inadvertently. In 2001, an experiment in which hemophiliacs were treated through the in sertion of corrected genes into their bloodstreams was halted after the alte red genes were discovered in one subject's semen, raising the possibilit y that the changed genes could show up in sperm.8 Another example is oocyte transfer, an infertility treatment in which ooplasm from a donor egg is injected into the ooplasm of the mother's egg, thus creating a child with DNA from three rather than two individuals: nuclear DNA from the fa ther and mother, and mitochondrial DNA from the egg donor.9 Deliberate germline gene therapy is highly controversial; germline manipulation for purposes other than to prevent or treat disease is even more so.10 Many practical obstacles remain as well, such as the difficulty of 5.

In addition, there are many philosophical and political objections to directed evolution, rang ing from complaints that it would be hubris to interfere with God's natural pl an, to the fear that evolutionarily advanced humans would enslave the rest of the species. See, e.g. , BILL MCKIBBEN, ENOUGH : STAYING HUMAN IN AN ENGINEERED AGE 209 (2003) (\"In the Western tradition, the idea of limits goes right back to the start, to a God who made heaven and earth, beast and man, and then decided that it was all enough, and stopped .\"); George J.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 98 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 3:93 this threat is exceeds the scope of this article.22 The question addressed here is a more preliminary, but nonetheless critical inquiry: how should the threat be assessed? More specific ally, what methodological framework should be employed? As will be s een, the answers to these questions are not merely rhetorical; they dictate the starting point for establishing the means by which humanity might be saved from destruction. A. The Catastrophists Averting the destruction of humanity has become somewhat of a cottage industry for legal scholars. Harvard law professor and now Administrator of White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Cass Sunstein has written two books on the subject: Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle in 2005,23 and Worst-Case Scenarios in 2007.24 Richard Posner, formerly a law professor at the Univer sity of Chicago and now a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, wrote Catastrophe: Risk and Response in 2004.25 Both authors pay considerable attention to environmental disasters, especially glo bal warming, but Posner in particular contemplates threats posed by science gone wild, and offers an interesting approach in deciding if we are tryi ng hard enough to prevent them. The difficulty, according to Posner, is the uncertainty surrounding the probability that a dire risk will materialize.26 If we knew how likely it is that the Earth will be destroyed by an aste roid, for example, we could calculate the cost if this were to occur and then generate a figure for how much we should be spending to avert it by , say, monitoring the heavens and preparing space weapons to knock the object off course. The problem is that we don't know for sure how likely it is that a large asteroid will strike us. I n t h e f a c e o f t h i s u n c e r t a i n t y , o n e o p t i o n i s t o m a k e a g u e s s . B u t a s Sunstein emphasizes, there are all sort s of methods that can be used to guess about risks, and they can lead to very different results. 27 Estimates of a cataclysmic asteroid collision with Earth, according to Posner, for example, range from once in every 50 million to 100 million years.28 Posner's solution is what he calls \"inverse cost-benefit analysis.\"29 First, we 22.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2009] WILL DIRECTED EVOLUTION DESTROY HUMANITY? 99 must figure out how much the government is spending to prevent the disaster and divide it by the social cost if the disa ster were to come about, and this generates \"an approximation to the implied probability of the catastrophe.\" 30 Then we must see how comfortable we are with this probability. For example, we can compar e it to the range of risk estimates put forward by experts. If the expe rts' estimates are much greater, we should take greater precautions; if the estimates are lower, we are overreacting and should cut back on prev ention. Posner calculates that we are spending about $3.9 million a year to detect potentially dangerous asteroids, and that this is only commensurate with the mean risk of a collision estimated by experts (1.70 in 100 million per year) if we value a person's life as worth only $50,000, which Posner believes is much too low. 31 Therefore, he concludes, we are not spending enough to avert an asteroid collision.32 Using Posner's approach, are enough precautions being taken to prevent the destruction of the human species by the harmful effects of directed evolution? It is extremely di fficult to calculate how much spending exists, but for purposes of this discu ssion it is assumed that the National Institutes of Health is spending ab out 10 percent of its $18 million annual budget for its Ethical, Legal, and So cial Implications (ELSI) program33 on directed evolution; that 10 percent of the FDA's $245 million annual budget for its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,34 which regulates genetic products, is spent on genetic en gineering; and that the annual cost to run the NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, which advises the NIH and the FDA on genetic engin eering research, is about $3 million. 35 This yields an annual expenditure of around $29.3 million. Posner estimates the value of the human race at $600 trillion.36 The amount being spent divided by the cost of extinction reveals an implied annual risk of 1 in 4.7 million that directed evolution will destroy the species.

B. Lessons from History There have been three major scientific research undertakings that scientists feared could destroy humanity. The first was the Manhattan Project, when one of the researchers, Edward Teller, who would become known as \"the father of the hydrog en bomb,\" warned that an atomic detonation might ignite the nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere or the hydrogen in its oceans and incinerate the planet. 37 Other scientists on the project examined Teller's concern and concluded that it was groundless because \"no matter how high the temperature, energy loss would exceed energy production by a reasonable factor.\"38 Particle acceleration is another scientif ic effort that has triggered alarm. When the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory placed the Bevalac accelerator into operation in 1975,39 there was some speculation that it could create a massive, abnormal state of matter that could destroy the Earth. Joseph Kapusta, who was a physics graduate stud ent at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, describes this speculation as \"tongue-in-cheek,\"40 but admits that \"no one really knew what to expect when nuclear matter was compressed to three-to-four times the density of atomic nuclei.\"41 Apocalyptic fears surfaced once again when a more powerful accelerator, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), was built at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1999.42 The RHIC was designed to create \"quark-gluon plasma, a new stat e of matter representative of the state of the universe when it was less than one microsecond old and temperatures were greater than two trillion Kelvin.\"43 One concern was that 37.

What explains this dissonance? Roco is not oblivious to the potential of nanotech to alter humanity; he notes that this is a cause of much apprehension, particularly in regard to the use of nanotech in genetic modification and in devices that control biological functions. 84 But as an engineer, Roco approaches the safety of nanotech from the viewpoint of engineering,85 not bioethics. His language is that of environmental, not health care, risk regulation.86 An engineering approach to catastrophic science has several implications. First, the scientific endeavor in question tends to be pictured as a single, big project, like building a dam, which creates the impression that it can be easily controlled or, if necessary, stopped altogether. The association of catastrophic risk with \"big science\" fits the historical examples of the Manhattan Project and huge particle colliders. It even can apply to the development of recombinant DNA tec hnology as laboratories essentially used the same technology despite the geographic dispersion of the laboratories themselves. But it is not appropriate for directed evolution, which, as described at the outset, co mprises a wide variety of biomedical interventions occurring at many points in the human reproductive process, and which therefore will be much more difficult to regulate. 82.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2009] WILL DIRECTED EVOLUTION DESTROY HUMANITY? 107 The engineer's risk assessment perspective also tends to be relatively detached and impersonal. Roco, for example, worries about the effect of nanotech on \"biosystems\" rather than on individuals, an d victims of harm are characterized as abstract statistical lives, rather than as actual persons.87 The fears triggered by directed evolution also extend to abstractions like \"future generations\" or \"the human spec ies,\" as reflected, admittedly, in the title of this article (\"Will Directed Evolution Destroy Humanity \"). But the techniques of directed evolution have a direct effect on actual individuals: those whose genomes are intentionally selected or modified. Directed evolution might well endanger the human species, but foremost, it creates risks for specific human beings. For these reasons, the better conceptual framework for grappling with the threats posed by directed evolutio n is the approach of bioethics, which r e q u i r e s u s to f o c u s o n th e w e l f a r e o f discreet individuals. This does not mean that an individual's well-being trumps the welfare of the group. Bioethicists disagree, for example, over whether deontology, which holds that individuals must be treated as ends in themselves rather than as means to the benefit of others, or utilitarianism, which seeks to maximize the greatest good for the greatest number, rather than the good of any single person, is ethically correct, and virtua lly all bioethicists would agree that there are limits to an individual's freedom of action. Nor does a bioethics approach mean that we should ignore risks to future persons or the human gene pool. As we contemplate directed evolution, bioethics merely forces us to keep in the forefront of our minds what happens to our children. Posner and Sunstein, who decidedly ta ke an engineer's perspective on catastrophic risks, implicitly seem to recognize this. Although they include genetic modification of plants among the risks they consider, 88 they omit a discussion of the risks of human genetic engineering. Interestingly, they also do not discuss genetically modified animals, not even food animals.89 They do not explain why, but one reason ma y be that they sense that, when it comes to manipulating animals to benefit humans, it is necessary to consider the welfare of individual animal s rather than just the fate of animal populations or species.90 87. See IRGC, supra note 83, at 11. 88. See POSNER , supra note 25, at 38, and S UNSTEIN , supra note 24, at 127-28. 89. Sunstein mentions genetically modified \"food\" though, and he recognizes the distinction between the loss of an animal species and the loss of a member of that species. SUNSTEIN , supra note 23, at 20, 64, 116 (\"The point is not that the death of individual animals is reversible; it is not. The point is th at on a widely held view, extinction counts as a catastrophic loss, whereas the death of species members does not.\"). 90.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 108 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 3:93 D. Directed Evolution from a Bioethics Perspective From the perspective of bioethics, the central question raised by directed evolution is whether intentional changes to the genes of our children, whether they occur directly, such as through germline manipulation, or indirectly, such as through mating de cisions or the selection of desirable embryos during assisted reproduction, comport with the basic principles of bioethical behavior. These principles were most clearly articulated in the 1979 report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavior al Research, known as The Belmont Report: \"respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.\" 91 1. Respect for Persons As the Belmont Report points out, respect for persons differs depending on whether or not the individual is capable of making autonomous decisions, that is, whether the indivi dual is \"capable of deliberation about personal goals and of acting under the direction of such deliberation.\"92 If so, then respect for persons requires that that individual be allowed to do so. If not, the individual must be protected from harm. Clearly, future generations that will be affected by directed evolution are incapable of making autonomous deci sions about the actions of their ancestors. This requires us to be careful about what changes we introduce into the human germline, but it does not preclude us from making any changes whatsoever. As bioethicist Ray Moseley points out, the argument that we cannot shape the human genome of the future because future humans cannot give their consent, \"[t]aken at face value . . . would imply that it is unethical to do anything affecting future generations, including produce them, since one cannot acquire their permission nor predict their wishes.\" 93 Moseley proposes instead that a \"more reasonable and ethically sound guiding principle in regard to decisions effecting [sic] future generations should be that whatever is done must . . . not lead to predictably bad consequences for future persons.\"94 91.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2009] WILL DIRECTED EVOLUTION DESTROY HUMANITY? 109 In the context of directed evolutio n, the individuals most immediately affected are the children whose genomes have been changed or chosen. Like more remote future generations, they too are incapable of making autonomous decisions. This has led some commentators to claim that it may be unethical to modify the germline of one's children. 95 Similar objections have been lodged against parents using biomedicine to enhance their children's mental and physical abi lities. Joel Feinberg, for example, argues that children have a right to an \"open future.\" 96 \"It is a duty of parents,\" he states, \"to keep as many as possible of a child's central life- options open until the child becomes an autonomous adult himself, and can decide on his own how to exercise them.\"97 Tom Murray, the bioethicist in charge of the prestigious Hastings Ce nter, would deny parents the right to use genetic testing to select their childre n's gender on the basis that it would mean \"giving in to a parental whim where that whim is not particularly significant, and when there's not a compelling reason for having more choice and control in children . . . .\" 98 But parents routinely choose or change their children's futures, from deciding with whom to have a child , to purchasing donor gametes, to agreeing to proceed to term despite fetal tests that reveal abnormalities, to picking their children's schools and select ing their extra-curricular activities. From the standpoint of autonomy, the fact that parents do so through the use of safe and effective genetic tec hnology does not seem to justify any greater limitations on their freedom than if they employ more traditional techniques, such as education accompanied by punishment or rewards. Although Julian Savulescu and Benne tt Foddy acknowledge that genetic testing could allow parents to identify their children's talents much earlier than has been possible in the past, they point out that \"[w]e already look to identify a person's particular talents when they [sic] are very young. Children with nimble fingers and perfect pitch are encouraged to play the violin, and children who grow tall at a young age are encouraged to play basketball.\" 99 Even firm opponents of gene tic engineering like Mark Frankel and Audrey Chapman, authors of the repo rt of the American Association for the Advancement of Science that concluded that germline genetic 95.

Beneficence Beneficence has both a negative and a positive component: \"do no harm,\" and \"maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms.\" 102 This opens up the question of what efforts to direct evolution should be deemed to cause harm to children, which in turns leads to an inquiry about how much latitude the parents themselves should have to provide an answer. Parents enjoy wide latitude to raise their children as they choose. The Supreme Court in 1923 acknowledged that parents have a right to \"bring up children.\" 103 In 1925, the Court reaffirmed that parents are entitled \"to direct the upbringing and educatio n of children under their control.\"104 Even though in 1944, the Court ruled that parents could not force their children to work in violation of a state child labor law, the Court again recognized the fundamental nature of the parental right of control: \"It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.\" 105 As recently as 2000, the Court proclaimed that \"the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u2014is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.\"106 100.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2009] WILL DIRECTED EVOLUTION DESTROY HUMANITY? 111 Parental rights include the right to im pose health risks on children. The Court points out that \"[s]imply because the decision of a parent . . . involves risks does not automatically transfer th e power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state.\"107 Parents have been allowed to withhold consent to co rrective surgery for a child's heart defect;108 refuse to consent to chemotherapy;109 deny permission for their children to be given psychotropic drugs even though the parents no longer had custody;110 and donate a child's kidney to a sibling.111 P a r e n t s a l s o place their children at risk when they permit them to play dangerous sports. Parental authority is not unlimited, however. The Supreme Court points out that \"a state is not without constitu tional control over parental discretion in dealing with children when thei r physical or mental health is jeopardized.\"112 The courts have intervened when parents failed to obtain treatment for a five-week-old infant with two broken arms;113 when a mother exposed a child to secondhand cigarette smoke during visitations;114 when a mother tried treating her seriously-burned daughter at home with \"wheat germ oil, Golden Seal, comfrey, myrrh and cold water,\" 115 rather than taking her to a hospital; and when a six week-old baby born to a vegan couple died of malnutrition after be ing fed a diet of soy milk and apple juice. 116 In a recent case, a mother who fled Minnesota with her son to avoid chemotherapy was threatened wi th contempt unless she returned and allowed him to obtain treatment.117 An interesting question is what leads courts to uphold the parents when they refuse chemotherapy for their child ren, such as in the Delaware case referenced above, but then order treatment in other cases, such as the one in Minnesota. One possibility is that judges will defer to parents when parents object to chemotherapy on th e grounds that, despite its potential effectiveness, it would subject their chil d to excessive pain and suffering (the 107.

In the Minnesota case, for example, the mother told a judge that she preferred natural remedies such as herbs and vitamins that she heard about on the Internet.119 In addition, the mother and son belonged to an Am erican Indian religious group called Nemenhah, which believes in natural healing.120 The distinction, it might be said, is that parents can be expected to be best able to know whether a particular treatment would be inhumane treatment for their children, but not in a position to second-guess medica l experts about the effectiveness of alternative treatment approaches. But in another case from Northern Ohio,121 as well as in this Minnesota example, the parental motives are not so clearly distinct. The Ohio parents objected to chemotherapy because of its side effects, but they also took their son to a holistic practitioner who attempted to treat their son's cancer by putting him on a special diet.122 The Minnesota mother's attorney argued that , in addition to preferring a natural alternative treatment approach for her son, the mother felt that the treatment, which the attorney described as \"a poison,\" would kill the boy in the same way the mother believed it had killed her sister.123 Indeed, the whole issue of how far parental discretion extends is murky. The case law is highly fact-specific, and seems to reach different conclusions depending on the jurisdiction and the temperament of each particular judge. Therefore, it is not possible to predict with certainty how courts would react to more extreme forms of directed evolution, such as parental decisions to genetically engineer their o ffspring. It seems likely that parents will be given wide latitude to direct the genetic make-up of their children using more traditional methods of reproduction. The courts may well extend parental autonomy to the use of assisted reproductive technologies such as sperm and egg donation and embryo selection for implantation following 118.

Other cases also present a mixed set of parental motives.

One possibility is intentional diminishment: parental decisions or manipulations that intentionally decreased a child's capaciti es or attractiveness. This is an extremely controversial topic which has come up in connection with parents with disabilities who wish to deliberately produce a child with the same disability. A salient example concerns deaf parents who wish to select only those embryos for implantation that have the same genetic characteristic for deafness. 127 Some say that reproductive freedom does not extend this far,128 and that intentional diminishment denies children an open future.129 124. There have been only two cases in which the courts have considered the constitutionality of government interference with assisted reprod uction. A federal court struck down an Illinois law that made it illegal to experiment upon a fetus in part because the law could be interpreted to prohibit the process by wh ich an embryo fertilized in the laboratory is implanted in the womb.

The other case involved a teacher who alleged that she had been fired by an Ohio public school board because she was an unwed mother who had become pregnant with the aid of artificial insemination.

Fifteen years ago, the American Medical Association's Counc il on Ethical and Judicial Affairs issued a policy statement on genetica lly enhancing children that said that \"genetic interventions to enhance traits should be considered permissible only in severely restricted situations.\"131 In addition to requiring \"clear and meaningful benefit to the person,\" the Council declared that there should be \"no trade-off with other characteristics or traits.\" 132 Taken literally, this would preclude parents from making a substantial improvement in one of a child's capabilities that was accompanie d by a minor decrease in another, for example, increasing IQ by thirty points at the expense of a slight reduction in height. It is difficult to find a persuasive reason for such a limitation on parental decision-makin g, since parents constantly make choices that enhance some characteristic or ability of their children's at the expense of others, by for example, giving a child music lessons or tutoring that interferes with other potential extracurricular activities. Another possibility is that parents shou ld be prohibited from engaging in active forms of genetic engineering su ch as adding or deleting genes, and be allowed to engage only in \"passive\" forms of engineering such as in vitro fertilization followed by genetic test ing of the resulting embryos and the selective implantation of those embryo s with the most desirable genomes. This would restrict parents to selectin g from among a natu rally-occurring set of genetic traits, rather th an introducing new or fanciful characteristics. This might reduce the chance that a gene tic modification would go awry and produce unexpected injury to the child, but if the technique used to produce the genetic modification had been shown to be safe and effective, there is no reason to forbid it on the ground that it is not natural. Clearly \"natural\" does not equate with \"good,\" since many cu rses of human existence are natural phenomena, such as tornados and cancer. 130.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2009] WILL DIRECTED EVOLUTION DESTROY HUMANITY? 115 So in the end, we are left merely with the principle that parents should be allowed to direct their children's genomes to the extent that such direction does not cause their children unreasonable harm or suffering. This is not as lame as it seems, since the unreason ableness standard is a well-known legal mechanism that hinges on community val ues as represented by the views of jurors. But when it comes to judging parental actions, and especially actions in the course of reproduction, it is important to remember the constitutional deference to parental decisions mentioned earlier. 133 Hence, the standard must be qualified by adding that any interference by the state must be given strict scrutiny by the courts: in addition to serving a compelling state interest in protecting ch ild welfare, the state action must be narrowly tailored and the least restrict ive means to achieve that interest.134 Furthermore, in keeping with the paren ts' fundamental right of parenting, any doubts about whether the parents' action is or is not reasonable should be resolved in favor of the parents. As a practical matter, what does it mean to say that parents' ability to genetically engineer their offspring should be restricted in this way? Should parents who genetically harm their chil dren be punished? Although this might deter parents from causing harm, it also would be likely to aggravate the child's condition by either depriving the child of parental care if the parents are jailed, or decreasing the resources available to raise the child if the parents are fined. A better approach would be to focus enforcement efforts on the health care profession als who facilitate the parents' actions, namely, the fertility clinics and physicia ns who provided the genetic services. At present, there is little regulation of the assisted reproduction industry, 135 but this could be changed by requiring clinics to be certified and threatening withdrawal of certification if they permitted parents to make harmful d e c i s i o n s .

There is also little state regulation of IVF clinics, and virtually no controls on the donor egg and sperm industry or on preimplantation or prenatal genetic testing. Assuming that a new regulatory regime was created, one model would be the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority established in Great Britain in 1991 under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990. This agency licenses IVF clinics and di ctates the preimplantatio n genetic testing that they can perform.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 116 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 3:93 restrictions on providers could be said to interfere indirectly with the parents' procreative rights.136 Another possibility would be to allo w the children who were harmed to obtain damages from these providers. (The parents would not be able to recover because they had collaborated in producing the harm, and therefore would be deemed to be co ntributorily negligent or to have assumed the risk.) This depends on whether the jurisdiction recognizes the tort of wrongful life, and if so , what elements of damages may be awarded.137 In keeping with the second part of the beneficence principle, maximizing potential benefits and minimizing possible harms, the government also has an important role to play in making su re that the technologies that parents use to alter their children's genomes are safe and effective.138 At present, there is little assurance that the government is equipped to fulfill this role. The Food and Drug Administration asse rts that it has the authority to regulate gene therapy as either drugs or \"biologics.\"139 G e n e t i c modifications for non-therapeutic (i.e., enhancement) purposes would not fit within the definition of a biologic.140 The definition of a \"drug\" is broader and includes \"articles (other than food ) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.\"141 Regarding a genetic modification as a drug or biological product, however, raises the question of whether it is an article\u2014i.e., a product\u2014or a 136. Cf., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 481 (1964) (permitting physician convicted of aiding-and-abetting married coup les in violation of a state law prohibiting contraception, to assert constitution al rights of contraceptives users). 137.

The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine.142 Nevertheless, the agency has asserted jurisdiction over gene therapy\u2014the introduction of modified genes into th e body to prevent, cure or mitigate disease\u2014which the agency regards as falling within the definitions of both drugs and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.143 This sounds defensible insofar as modified genes represent \"products.\" But the FDA also has cl aimed jurisdiction over both human reproductive cloning144 (which prompted Richard Merrill, a law professor and former FDA chief counsel, to describe the FDA's rationale as \"surprisingly delphic\"), 145 and ooplasmic transfer (an assisted reproductive technique used to treat infertility in which a portion of a normal donor egg called the ooplasm is removed and injected into a woman's infertile egg, enabling it to implant itself in the womb). 146 In both of these cases, the FDA seems to be claiming that a human e gg is a \"product,\" which may strike some as a stretch. Assuming the FDA does have jurisdiction over genetic engineering, or Congress confers jurisdiction in future amendments to the FDA's legislative authority, it is not clear how well the agency can fulfill the role of protecting children from unsafe or ineffective genetic interventions. The FDA relies on large-scale clinical trials to estab lish safety and efficacy, but growing understanding of individual differences in responses to biomedical technologies\u2014the rise of so-called \"p ersonalized medicine\"\u2014raises doubts about the usefulness of this approach: what works well for one child may be harmful or even deadly for another, bas ed on differences in their genes and environment. 147 Increasingly, regulators are planning to rely on actual 142.

To the extent that genetic manipulation is studied in formal clinical trials, the FDA requires these investigations to conform to the human subjects protections embodied in regulations called the \"Common Rule.\" 149 Special sections of these regulations govern research with children and fetuses.150 But there are numerous unresolved ques tions concerning how to apply these rules to experiments involving interventions aimed at enhancing human traits rather than addressing disease,151 which is likely to be a major aspect of parental genetic engineering of offspr ing. Moreover, although there are special protections for pregnant women, there are none for embryos, and as mentioned earlier, some kinds of ge netic engineering are likely to be performed on embryos fertilized in the laboratory.152 Finally, there is widespread agreement that institutio nal review boards\u2014the primary mechanism for ensuring that the regu lations are followed\u2014do not do an adequate job.153 In addition to actual genetic engi neering, another tool of directed evolution, as discussed above, is genetic testing, which helps would-be parents decide whether or not to procreate, which embryos to implant in the uterus, and which fetuses to bring to term. 154 Genetic testing is regulated by Traditional Chinese Medicine: A Critical Appraisal , 31 J.L.

Without their in volvement, parents might incorrectly assume that the tests really can do what they claim, when there may not be sufficient evidence to establish their val idity, or parents mi ght misinterpret the results.157 Currently, there is virtually no regulation of at-home tests by the FDA or other branches of the government. In short, the regulatory system requires significant improvement before parents, and in turn society, can be confident that attempts to direct evolution will avoid undue harm to the children who are the immediate targets of these efforts. 3. Justice The final ethical principle that shou ld govern directed evolution is justice. The Belmont Report discusses justice primarily in connection with selecting subjects for medical experime nts, prohibiting the use of subjects who face undue economic pressures to participate or who lack the resources to benefit from the experimental intervention should it become commercially available.158 But the principle of just ice is much broader.

E. Is Bioethics Up to the Task? The three main principles of bioe thics\u2014autonomy, beneficence, and justice\u2014would go some way toward pr eventing directed evolution from injuring children who were its immediate targets.

The principle of justice extends the scope of societal concern beyond the impact on specific children to the adverse consequences for the polity as a whole of basing access to directed evolutionary technologies on ability to pay. Acknowledging these principles in the abstract, however, does not ensure that they will be applied effectively. As can be seen from the foregoing discussion, bioethicists themselves disagree about how these principles should be interpreted; for example, bioethicists may disagree how far parents should be allowed to go in controlling their children's futures. Ideological differences preclude consen sus on what the role of the market should be in distributing access to sc arce evolution-directing technologies. Indeed, a sizeable segment of American society continues to reject the idea of natural evolution in the first place, 166 and many of those who accept it no doubt believe that directed evolution would offend their God. As genetic technology continues to advance, these disp utes will have to be resolved in order for bioethics to play its proper role. Bioethics, I have argued, is the foremost theoretical framework for preventing directed evolution from destroying us. But bioethics is not the only way; the engineering approach also has its place. It forces us to consider whether successfully applying th e principles of bioethics, assuming this could protect our children, would in fact stave off species-wide catastrophe. Are there threats to the species that would not register as undue harm to a child? I can think of at least one possibility: parents selecting the gender of their offsprin g, and opting overwhelmingly for one sex. It is doubtful that sex selection pe r se could be said to harm the child or be unjust. If parents favored giving birth to boys rather than girls, a widespread preference in parts of Asia, 167 how many people would hold that 166. In a 2005 survey, fifty-one percent of Americans believed that God created humans as is, thirty percent believed humans evolved but God directed the evolution, and fifteen percent believed that humans evolved without help from God.

In a 2006 survey of thirty-two European countries, Japan, and the United States, the United states had the second lowest percentage of people that be lieve in evolution, with only Turkey having fewer. The survey found that forty percent of Americans accept evolution, thirty-nine percent reject it, and twenty-one percent are unsure. Jon D.
