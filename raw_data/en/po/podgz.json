On this page [Skip this page navigation](#toc-end) Overview The Ministry of the Solicitor General is committed to providing Indigenous, First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis inmates access to their traditional spiritual practices, and ensuring these practices are given the same status and protections afforded other faith groups. Visits by an elder In addition to the general spiritual care provided by institution chaplains, an Indigenous inmate is permitted access to an Indigenous spiritual leader, Elder or healer. These visits are: - permitted during operationally viable hours - subject to the superintendent's normal control of visits to the institution - in addition to visits described in the [Visiting Policy](/page/visiting-policy-adult-correctional-facilities) These visits will be coordinated by either a: - Chaplain - Native Inmate Liaison Officer (NILO) - Inuit Liaison Worker (ILW) - person designated by the superintendent Ceremonies Individual and group ceremonies play an important role in Indigenous spiritual practices. Opportunities to participate in traditional communal worship ceremonies will be provided to First Nation, Metis and Inuit inmates when an Indigenous spiritual leader, Elder or Healer is available. Communal ceremonies may include: - sweatlodge ceremonies - healing circles - pipe ceremonies - feasts All ceremonies require a NILO or Elder to be present to conduct or oversee the ceremony except for smudging. Priority for attendance at any ceremony is given to Indigenous inmates who wish to participate. Inmates with sincerely held beliefs in Indigenous spiritual practices can participate in standalone ceremonies. If there is space available, inmates not part of an Indigenous program may also participate. Sweat lodge ceremonies The sweat lodge is a place to seek: - healing from grief or trauma - direction and guidance for better living Sweat lodges on the ministry's property are normally regarded as temporary structures. If there is no sweat lodge, superintendents will encourage alternative spiritual observances in consultation with an Indigenous spiritual leader, Elder or healer. Indoor accommodations The ministry will provide indoor accommodations for ceremonies where and when required, for example in chapels or program rooms. For ceremonies that involve burning medicines or smudging, correctional facilities must provide accommodations through consultation between the superintendent and at least one of the following: - the Indigenous Elder - NILO - an Indigenous spiritual leader Methods can be used to minimize smoke when burning medicines indoors, including the use of: - an air/smoke purifier - fans - ventilation - opening of windows Indigenous spirituality must not be impacted by the ministry's smoking policies. Smudging may occur outdoors where weather permits and as requested by inmate(s). Inmate smudges may occur in the absence of a NILO or Elder. Medicines for this purpose must be kept in an accessible location for trained staff to retrieve and will be held in suitable containers to avoid staff directly handling medicines. Sacred items Spiritual practices and teachings may vary as they relate to: - sacred items - medicines - moontime for women Cultural teachings should be sought from the Elder or NILO. The Elder or NILO can bring sacred items temporarily into the institution, such as drums, pipes and feathers, following clearance by the security manager. These items must be properly and securely stored. The Elder or NILO is responsible for the care and control of these items while in the institution. Items must not be left in the facility when the Elder or NILO's services are discontinued. Ceremonial clothing Clothing that is worn for special events and ceremonies should not be altered in anyway, except by the owner of the clothing or with the consultation and guidance of an Elder. Ceremonial clothing includes items such as: - regalia for a powwow - ribbon shirts - pants and skirts - ceremonial dresses - moccasins or the M\u00e9tis sash Fasts If an inmate requests to fast, a meeting will be arranged with an Elder/NILO as soon as possible. The meeting will help determine the appropriateness of doing a full fast while in custody. Following the meeting, consultation between the superintendent and the Elder/NILO should occur to discuss the outcome and next steps. Feasts Feasts can be approved and conducted in institutions and will be coordinated by the Indigenous resource person (such as, NILO, ILW). There are generally four feasts per year to coincide with the change of seasons. Institutions are not limited to just four. The Indigenous resource person coordinating the feast will receive approval from the superintendent or designate regarding: - menu - process - managing security issues Consultation with the local public health unit is required in order to develop proper local procedures for feasts. These procedures will be followed for all feasts. Where staff are asked to prepare food for the Feast, only staff who receive the related cultural teachings should handle the food. This is to ensure that the spiritual integrity of the feast is maintained. Sacred medicines and other items The ministry will provide an inmate with essential traditional medicines upon request or at the request of an Elder. The NILO, ILW, Elder or Healer must identify these medicines. These items are to be kept in a medicine bag or sacred pouch that meets security standards. Providing inmates with medicine bags, sacred pouches or amulets A spirit leader, Elder or Healer may provide an inmate with a small medicine bag, sacred pouch and other sacred items during a visit. They must first go through clearance by the NILO, ILW or Chaplaincy and the security manager. Medicine bags or amulets will remain with an inmate in their living unit at all times during their incarceration. All spiritual items, except for the medicine bag or amulets, will be held in a designated area when not being used and only handled by designated staff under the direction of the Elder. "}
