M cKinney School of Law Winter 2021 IssueKaren E. Bravo Dean and Professor of LawAs we approach the end of 2020, I am grateful for this opportunity to reflect upon the first six months of my deanship. I am struck by the number of challenges we faced in 2020, and am grateful for and in awe of the ways in which our community\u2014our faculty, staff, students, and alumni, met those challenges. In these pages, you will read about the outstanding faculty efforts in the realm of online learn- ing. We are lucky that we had a strong online program prior to the pandemic, and experienced faculty members who helped one another as, with short notice, we transformed all of our courses into an all-online format last Spring and Summer. Their expertise and commitment also created benefits for our Fall semester's hybrid teaching format, which featured online courses, along with a full menu of in-person (and properly socially-distanced) course offerings. The contributions of all of our staff members have been essential as we transitioned to all-online, then a hybrid format. Permit me to recognize, in particular, the roles of our extraordinary IT staff in providing support for online and in-person courses, online exams, and dozens of virtual online events and programs. Y ou will see that they have been honored for their extraordinary efforts. We must also commend our students for their resilience during this trying time. They con- tinued their pro bono activities and student organizations offered programs for their mem- bers, all in a virtual environment. Y ou will also read about our school's response to the racial tensions throughout our nation. Alumni and members of the local legal community (with the assistance of the IU McKinney Office of Diversity & Inclusion), gathered on Juneteenth for an event seeking an end to racial inequities and violence, as well as advocating for inclusivity and acceptance. IU McKinney students added their voices to the message, and many faculty, staff and students attended the event. As you may know, Indiana University celebrated its bicentennial in 2020 and, while much of the celebration had to be cut short because of the pandemic, we are happy to report that we exceeded our fund-raising goal during the Bicentennial Campaign. We have included in this issue an account of that extraordinary effort. We are so very grateful to all who made contri-butions in support of our school. Because of you, we will be able to continue our mission of providing an exceptional legal education for upcoming generations of students. I began my deanship under the strictures of the pandemic and have not yet had the opportunity to meet as many of you in person as I had hoped. Please know that I plan to rectify that situation as soon as it is safe to do so. I was able to \"meet\" many of you virtu-ally, through several events, and we are planning more of those virtual gatherings in the upcoming Spring semester. Watch our website for more details. Finally, I want to wish you all the best for a peaceful, happy, and most especially\u2014a healthy 2021. I look forward to meeting you and sharing with you our plans to build upon the strong foun-dations of our school, and to make the next decade at IU McKinney even better than the last one!

News Briefs IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 3 4 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE Dean Bravo joined the IU McKinney faculty in 2004 and has served in several leadership roles, both within the law school and on the IUPUI campus. She be-came vice dean in Fall 2018. In the following interview, Dean Bravo shares her thoughts about becoming dean at IU McKinney, her vision for the law school, and a little about herself. Why do you want to lead IU McKinney? I wanted to become dean of a law school, particularly this law school, because I believed that I was ready to play a larger institutional role, to affect the big - ger picture. I \"grew up\" at McKinney as an academic, and as an administrative leader\u2014and although I love the classroom and the instructional role, I wanted to make a different kind of impact by being in a leadership role. I think I am ready to face new challenges. I have grown to love Indianapolis, IU McKinney, and the IUPUI campus. It's a terrific place for a variety of reasons. What does it mean to you to be the first person of color, and only the second woman, to lead IU McKinney?Being the first, there's always the weight of history, a sense of 'we can't let fu-ture people of color and women down. ' I feel a sense of responsibility to do well, and awareness that my role, my time as dean, will affect others down the road. While I feel the weight of history, I think that it is a little bit sad that it is the year 2020, yet I'm a first. It indicates that there is more work to be done. Despite this conflicted response, I recognize that my appointment also provides an op-portunity. As we look around the country, at the demands of the people in our country, they want something to be done to improve justice and equity in our society. I hope that my identity and appointment to this position will help play a role in helping to respond to those demands. Y ou are becoming the leader of a law school during a time of tremendous upheaval. What is it you hope that students will take away with them as they begin their professional lives after law school? In a time of crisis, I hope students learn that the legal profession and the train- Karen Bravo Named Dean of IU McKinney Law By Rebecca Trimpe Karen E. Bravo began her duties as dean of the Indiana Univer - sity Robert H. McKinney School of Law on July 1, 2020. Dean Bravo is the first person of color and the second woman in the school's history to lead the urban-based institution. She is the 13th dean of the law school since its affiliation with IU in 1944. IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 5 ing they get at law school, prepares them to lead, to analyze, and to problem solve. Their legal education prepares them to respond to crisis. The flexibility and creativity of our faculty and staff, responding to the crisis in a student-centered way, should provide an example to our students about how to focus on their clients, those they will serve. I hope they will recognize the role of law is essential to a society's response to crises. What is your vision and what are your goals for the school? My vision for the law school is for us to build upon the institution's existing strong foundation. I place a high priority on student success, to ensure that all students have a rigorous educational experience with many opportunities to develop their professional identities. I want to make sure we provide diversity, equity, and inclusion, and that these values are embedded in the way in which we teach. Additionally, I want to make sure that IU McKinney continues to be a nexus for the legal community in Indianapolis as well as throughout Indiana. I also have a goal for the law school to engage in strategic planning that con- nects our community\u2014faculty, staff, students, alumni, and others with whom we work. While this may have become more challenging because of COVID-19, it is important to our future. I want to involve us as a community, working to-gether to confirm our mission and our vision for the future, to lay out steps for what we will do over the next five years to get to that future, and to hold ourselves accountable to make sure we are taking those steps. I believe in the transformative power of legal education. It transforms the lives of our students, which in turn impacts the lives of their clients and our communities. In this way, we are helping to form the future for our state, our country, and our world. What are your teaching and research interests, and how will you continue to pursue these endeavors while you are serving as dean?My research and teaching interests are different facets of the interrelationship of international law, business, and human trafficking. The underlying com-monality is the structural role of law and the impact of economic forces: In-stitutions that are created by law and the doctrines that we accept and invent, and how they play out in people's lives. I've written about trade law, human trafficking and slavery and, more recently, about business and human rights. I seek to understand the law in these different areas, ways that the law can pro-vide opportunities for people to advance. I've been thinking of the way people are adversely affected by the consequences of human trafficking, the struc-tural inequality that leaves people vulnerable. Law, on its own, is inadequate to prevent harm or provide remedies. We therefore need to have an interdisci-plinary perspective on its roles. It will be challenging to continue this work. I have created a network, the Slavery Past, Present and Future initiative. We've met four times over the span of five years and brought together scholars from a variety of disciplines. The meeting was canceled this year because of the pandemic, but our plan is to meet in 2021. With respect to my teaching, much will depend on the demands of the decanal job. I will not teach this year but, in future years, I hope to be able to teach a seminar so that I can continue to be connected with the students while fulfilling my administrative and leadership roles.What drew you to a career in law, and then into the legal academy?I was drawn to the law and law school because I wanted to do further stud-ies to better understand the world, and to engage my mind. I did not know much about the U.S. legal system as an immigrant, and I wanted to learn more about how the world worked. My legal education gave me the opportunity to transform my life. I was living in New Y ork City, and wanted to have an exciting, challenging and meaningful profession. The thirst for knowledge and for un-derstanding drew me into an academic role. Entering into the legal academy, I was drawn by the opportunity to have challenges, to write and think about the big picture legal and societal issues that interested and puzzled me. The intel-lectual life drew me, the opportunity to engage with students, and to continue to learn from them and from my colleagues. What was your favorite law school class when you were a student and why? There were two: International Law and Native American Law, or Federal Indian Law. International law helps you to understand the wider world. If you have an understanding of international law, you can understand the broader flow of history, and why leaders and countries behave in the ways they do. T o do in-ternational law well, you must engage with history, sovereignty, and other key foundational concepts that are embedded in our way of thinking. Y ou gain in-sights into the ways in which our contemporary reality is built upon constructs created in the past\u2014constructs and structures that continue to guide the interaction of countries, sometimes without awareness of or a deep inquiry into the reasons for their existence. In international law there may be no clear answers. Or, if there are clear answers, there may be an inability to implement those answers or to affect events because of other doctrines. It trains you to be comfortable in the space of uncertainty. I took Native American Law because I had gone to Australia to do an ex - ternship with an organization that worked with Australia's Aboriginal people. I realized that I didn't know much about America's first people, aside from ste-reotypes learned from watching television as a child. I didn't really understand that history, that parallel system of law within the U.S. If you hadn't gone into law, what would have been your profession? I would have been an historian/anthropologist, that's probably what I would have wanted to do. I don't feel that I gave that up, however, as law is also a study of human dynamics. The law gives you the opportunity to continue to engage with those subject areas. Y ou can explore the reasons why we have a law or policy in support of or against a particular thing. Social sciences give you a wonderful background to understand law. It's the perfect profession for me. Please tell us about IUPUI Next Generation 2.0 and your involvement in creating that program. Why was it important to you? In 2009 - 2011, there was a Next Generation leadership program on the IUPUI campus. However, when I tried to apply in 2012, I found that it no longer existed. Nevertheless, I was able to attend the Higher Education Resource Services (HERS) Bryn Mawr Summer Institute in 2013 with As-sociate Vice Chancellor for Faculty Diversity and Inclusion Gina S\u00e1nchez 6 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINEGibau. While participating in the institute, we were so impressed by the expansion of and transformation in our knowledge and understanding of leadership and of higher education that we wanted to bring this experi-ence to our campus. We realized that the vast majority of faculty and staff on campus would not be able to take part in the HERS Institute, both be-cause of the expense, and because of its residential nature (we spent two to three weeks in residence at Bryn Mawr College). We thought, \"why don't we create something new for the campus?\" We wanted to provide leader - ship opportunities for faculty and staff. The original Next Gen program was focused on traditionally underrepre- sented faculty members. We wanted to break down the horizontal and verti-cal silos on the campus. The horizontal silos are the division/lack of under - standing of roles between faculty and staff; and the vertical silos are the lack of interaction by staff and faculty with their counterparts in other schools or units on the campus. We collaborated with Kathy Grove, Director of the Office for Women (and an alumna of IU McKinney), spending a lot of time strategizing, planning, and lobbying for the creation of the program. We also formed an advisory board whose members provided additional and crucial insights and connections. Our goals were the retention and advancement of faculty and staff, and the advancement of women and minoritized groups into positions of leadership in higher education. Our goals for the Next Gen program aligned with the strategic goals that Chancellor Nasser Paydar had for campus. It's been extremely gratifying to participate in the implementa-tion of Next Generation 2.0 at IUPUI, and to witness how deeply the campus has embraced the initiative. What is your fondest memory of your first 16 years at the law school? My fondest memory is of coming to the call-back interview to join the fac-ulty of the law school. My daughter was less than a year old, and I was still nursing her. Susie Mead, who was interim dean at the time, had set up a schedule so that I could have time to care for her. After I received the job offer, my family came with me to visit Indianapolis and learn more about the city. I had had no opportunity to go shopping for the sudden downturn in the weather. Professor Mar\u00eda Pab\u00f3n, who is now at the Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, brought a pair of booties for the baby. Both of those things gave me a real sense of the character of my potential future colleagues, and of this institution. Can you tell us a little about your family? I have a 17-year-old who is a junior in high school, and a 10-year-old who is a fifth-grader. Both girls. We are an immigrant family. My husband is Australian and is an anthropologist. I'm Jamaican. And our children are second-genera-tion, and completely Hoosier-ized. What is your favorite food? My favorite American food is apple pie. I fell in love after having my first slice. My favorite Jamaican food is ackee and saltfish; it's the national dish. One of the interesting things about it is that if it's not properly prepared, it's poison-ous. Unfortunately, I can't really eat it anymore. I think I've developed an allergy or adverse reaction to it. Even so, I've been known to have a tiny little bit when given the opportunity. Can you tell us about the place you first called home? I grew up in Jamaica, in a suburb of Kingston, which is the capital city. It was absolutely beautiful, with views of the mountains, lush greenery and, of course, the ever-present sea. As a child and young adult, I didn't realize its beauty until I had traveled away and had opportunities for comparison. I received rigorous education there\u2014from \"baby school\" through earning my B.A. from the University of the West Indies\u2014that prepared me well for future studies. What is your favorite movie? There are two: Shawshank Redemption, and Love Actually. One is clearly more \"serious\" than the other. They have in common the depiction of the human drama, and interconnectedness and ups and downs of people's lives. Y ou'll notice that both have a feel-good ending. I'm attracted to the escapism, prob-ably because of the intense subjects that I focus on in academic research and writing, as well as my more casual reading. What is your favorite book? As a kid, I loved Anne of Green Gables. I loved it so much that, when we lived in Boston, we took the pilgrimage to Prince Edward Island to visit Avonlea and the real Green Gables. The character, Anne, was someone who was very different from me. I was a very law-abiding child. She was not. She was an outsider (who overcame her outsider status), she hated her red hair, she was not afraid to be herself. She had all kinds of adventures. She was a lover of books, poetry and reading, as I was, but she got into lots of scrapes. I enjoyed the vicarious adventures and being transported to an-other time and way of life. T wo other books had a huge impact on me after I came to the United States: James Baldwin's Go T ell it On the Mountain and T oni Morrison's The Bluest Eye. Through them, I began to gain insights into the United States. What are your favorite television shows, past or present? Star T rek: Deep Space Nine, Call the Midwife and The Durrells in Corfu on PBS. Currently, if I have time, I toggle among Grace and Frankie, Kim's Convenience, and Gentefied on Netflix. Do you have any pets at home? We have two guinea pigs and three cats. There are two very allergic people in our family, so the cats have their outdoor apartment, a \"catio, \" that a friend of ours constructed especially for them. The guinea pigs are usually being carted around by my younger daughter or hanging out in their habitat. We had a tor - toise last summer, but he managed to run away. (Funny story!) We had hoped to find him in the backyard this Spring or Summer after hibernation, but no luck so far. We reckon that he's miles away by now. We recently adopted a Beagle named Lucky. His middle name is \"McKinney, \" so he could rightly be considered the \"McKinney Legal Beagle!\" IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 7 Karen E.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINEAndrew R. Klein joined the faculty in 2000 and became Dean in the summer of 2013. He also holds the title of Paul E. Beam Professor of Law. From 2010-13, Profes- sor Klein served as Chief of Staff to the Office of the Chancellor and as Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at IUPUI. From 2004-07, he served as Associate Dean of Academic Affairs at IU McKinney. He is the third-longest serving dean of the school since its affiliation with IU in 1944. Before joining IU, he taught at Samford University's Cumberland School of Law and prac- ticed with the Chicago firm of Sidley & Austin. Former Dean Klein earned a B.A. with distinc- tion in journalism and economics from the University of Wisconsin and a J.D. with distinction from the Emory University School of Law, where he studied as a Robert W.

He plans to return to teaching following his decanal leave during the 2020-21 academic year. We talked to Prof essor Klein, as he reflected on his years as dean at IU McKinney Law Q: Looking back at your tenure as Dean, what are a few accomplishments or endeavors that are you are most pleased with? A: I don't look back at my tenure in terms of personal accomplishments. Every positive thing that happened at the law school during the past seven years was due to efforts by McKinney faculty, staff, students, and alumni. Listing examples is impossible, as I could not do so without excluding people who deserve praise. Suffice it to say that the McKinney Law family consists of talented, generous peo-ple doing incredible things for the community and for one another. I would like to think that I created an environment in which those things could happen. But maybe I helped by just staying out of the way! 10 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE Q: What (if anything) about the job surprised you? What did you enjoy the most? A: I was surprised by the degree to which the school and its alumni impact the world around us. Not completely surprised\u2014I have been part of our school for a long time and was aware of the role that we play in the city and state. But being dean showed me that the impact is even broader and more powerful than I ever had imagined. I truly enjoyed the experience of representing our school in a wide variety of settings. During my seven years as dean, I came to know amazing people that I otherwise would not have met\u2014from alumni who lead law firms and business- es to Supreme Court justices, to members of Congress, to leaders of advocacy groups, to scholars and officials from across the globe. I also enjoyed working more closely with the McKinney Law staff. We have a phenomenally talented group of people here who not only make the \"trains run on time,\" but who care deeply about serving our students. I hope everyone on the team knows how grateful I am for all they do. I also worry that I have been spoiled. I hope I can function in the future without their support every day!

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 11 Q: What are your plans for the next chapter? What are you most looking forward to? A: My plan is to be a law professor again! I entered academics from private practice 28 years ago be- cause I wanted to teach students. That is something I have done very little of while serving as Dean and in other administrative roles. I can't wait to teach first-year Torts again. It is really excit- ing to meet talented new students and introduce them to the foundations of our discipline and profession. I am revising my casebooks and teaching materials and am starting other writing projects. I was supposed to be a Visiting Fellow at Clare Hall and a Visit- ing Scholar at the University of Cambridge Law Faculty in England this year (an appointment he also held in 2007). Unfortunately, because of the pandemic, that did not happen, at least not during the Fall semester. It is disappointing, but when you see what is happening around the world, mine is a very small problem.

(Portrait by Indiana artist, Rob Day)On October 2, 2020, the IU McKinney School of Law announced a significant $4 million gift from alumnus Steve Tuchman, '71, and his husband, Reed Bobrick. The gift will support the creation of an endowed scholarship and an endowed professorship to further the school's commitment to diversity and inclusion. In honor of their con-tribution, the atrium in the law school building, Lawrence W. Inlow Hall, will be named the Steve Tuchman and Reed Bobrick Atrium. \"On behalf of IUPUI, I want to thank Steve and Reed for this gener- ous gift that reflects how deeply we value diversity and inclusion on our campus. The combination of an endowed scholarship and an en-dowed professorship that the gift supports will open doors of opportu-nity for students and faculty alike to further strengthen the McKinney School of Law as a destination for those committed to social justice and equity for all,\" said IUPUI Chancellor Nasser Paydar. The endowed scholarship will be available to students pursuing a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree at the IU McKinney School of Law. Special consideration will be given to underrepresented populations, including but not limited to members of the LGBTQ community, im-migrants, first-generation Americans, financially challenged students, and/or students with diverse cultural experiences. \"Steve thoroughly enjoys being a mentor to IU McKinney law students, many of whom have been so inspiring to us,\" Bobrick said. \"We are especially pleased that the school has had an excellent track record when it comes to is-sues of diversity, and we are certain that will continue.\" The endowed professorship is intended for an individual or indi- viduals whose work is in advancing LGBTQ rights and issues, repro-ductive rights and issues, and/or immigration law practice and policy. \"This generous and historically significant gift has the potential to be truly transformational for our law school. Each year, IU McKinney produces legal professionals and future leaders who contribute to their communities, the state of Indiana, and the world. We are delighted that Steve and Reed have chosen to invest in that future and that their generosity will be recognized within Inlow Hall. I look forward to the daily reminders of their generosity as I walk through our magnificent atrium,\" said law school dean, Karen E. Bravo. \"Many years ago, I recognized the potential and the value of this law school, located in our state capitol, in a city that was beginning to make things happen.

Steve Tuchman, B.A. '68, J.D., '71, is a Director with Lewis Kappes and his practice focuses primarily upon a wide variety of immigration and nationality issues with vast experience in employment and family related matters, employer sanctions, enforcement and removal cases, and naturalization cases. In 2004 he was named as a Sagamore of the Wabash. In 2014 he was awarded the Hine Medal for significant im-pact to the IUPUI campus. In 2015 he was designated as the Alumnus of the Year by the Indiana University GLBT Alumni Association, and in 2018 he was inducted into the Indiana University Presidents Circle. In addition, Tuchman has been a Commissioner on the Indianapo- lis Historic Preservation Commission and is active in the Indianapolis arts community, having served as a Commissioner on the Indiana Arts Commission, Chairman of the American Cabaret Theatre's Board of Directors, and has represented clients in the sports and entertainment fields. He serves as the Honorary Consul for Denmark in Indiana and Kentucky and has been knighted by Her Majesty Margrethe II, Queen of Denmark. He also was recognized by the McKinney School of Law at the 2019 IUPUI Spirit of Philanthropy luncheon. Tuchman and his husband, Reed Bobrick, have already made a sub- stantial gift commitment to the law school in 2013 to create the Tuchman Bobrick Scholarship. Bobrick is a graduate of Clark University and a found-ing partner and the principal designer for Misch Bobrick Design LLC. \"We intend this gift to ignite the potential for further growth and opportunity among students and faculty at IU McKinney,\" Tuchman said. \"It is up to the fantastic stewards of the future to make good use of this gift and continue the progress that has been made. We are pleased to be part of that effort.\" This gift counts toward the $3 billion For All: The Indiana Univer- sity Bicentennial Campaign. \"Steve and Reed are providing a transformative gift to the McK - inney School. They are providing support for the two key pillars of excellence\u2014faculty and students. By supporting faculty who focus on teaching and research on matters related to social justice and by pro-viding scholarship assistance for LGBTQ and other underrepresented students, this gift provides visible reinforcement of the school's val-ues,\" said Dan Smith, President and CEO of the Indiana University Foundation. \"And, having Steve and Reed's names associated with the McKinney atrium will inspire and bring a sense of pride to all stu-dents, staff and guests who frequent that stunning space,\" he added.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINEThe For All: Indiana University Bicentennial Campaign was the first time that all schools within IU were part of the same fund raising campaign. Because of the incred-ible generosity of so many alumni and friends, the university-wide campaign raised an astounding $3.9 billion for IU and concluded on September 30, 2020. At IU McKinney Law, $19.8 million was raised to sup - port students, faculty, and programs. Every gift received during the campaign counted toward the campaign to- tals, according to Nan Edgerton, IU McKinney Law As-sistant Dean for Development. \"This was truly an extraordinary accomplishment by our supporters,\" she said. Former McKinney Dean Andrew R. Klein, Paul E. Beam Professor of Law, echoed her assessment of the eight-year campaign. \"Thanks to our generous IU McKinney alumni, fac- ulty, staff, and friends, the Bicentennial Campaign, by any measure, was a resounding success,\" Professor Klein said. \"It was an honor to be part of such an incredible effort.

Palmer Scholarship Robert F. Wagner Trial Advocacy-Diversity ScholarshipWhat does it take to transform a mostly brick-and-mortar law school into an online operation in less than two weeks? IU McKinney School of Law\u2014like most across the country\u2014had to figure that out when the COVID-19 pandemic closed the doors to in-person teach- ing in late March. Fortunately, IU McKinney was already well-positioned to take emergency action, according to the law school's Director of Online Learning, Professor Max Huffman. The law school has had an ongoing com- mitment to distance learn- ing and an information and technology (IT) team that didn't hit pause in its quick work to help faculty and stu- dents get online. \"The response of our staff and faculty was ex - traordinary, as was our IT department. We couldn't run the law school without the IT team, even before this crisis, \" Professor Huff - man said. That team, led by As- sistant Dean of T echnology Services T erri Cuellar in-cluding Andrew Bell, Brianna Garr-Bland, Darius Price, Brian Singleton, Michelle Werner and Jason Y avor are generally always busy with faculty and staff needs, from trouble-shooting hard- ware and software issues to setting up for large-scale events requiring audio- visual equipment. Within hours of the announcement that all classes would be online for the rest of the spring semester, the IT team began collaborating with Professor Huffman Spring semester 2020 at IU McKinney Law started out much as any other. It was cold. Events were in the planning stages, scheduled to take place in March and April when the threat of ice storms and bad weather passed. Classes met. In January, the annual experiential learning fair took place in the atrium. In Febru-ary, students danced the night away at the annual Barrister's Ball at the Indiana Roof Ballroom. Later that month, they supported a good cause by bidding on items at the Women's Caucus Auction. It was business as usual. Until it wasn't. In March, students went on an extended spring break and \"returned\" to online classes and online exams. Commencement was postponed and life as we know it at Inlow Hall changed dramatically. The next few pages will illustrate just a few of those changes and how we are coping during the threat of COVID-19.

They quickly organized a series of faculty training sessions to help IU McKin- ney professors get up to speed on online in- structional technology and pedagogy and called on the expertise of the IUPUI Center for T eaching and Learning for support in helping the law school quickly re-design law courses, assessments and exams. Students were on an extended Spring break, but when they returned and classes resumed online, they expressed few concerns about coping with the technology aspect, according to Cueller. \"It's just a sign of the times, \" she said. \"Our students are very comfortable with technology. \" \"This is a real lawyering skill, to han- dle this kind of disruption, \" Huffman said. \"Lawyers around the world have had to adjust to this new normal. \" \"I have the best team, no doubt, \" Cueller said. \"They respond to every request with respect. We get the job done. \" In April, the entire IT staff was recognized with the Outstanding Administra- tive Staff Award. T raditionally, the award recognizes a single member of the school's administrative staff whose support and dedication to excellence has furthered the school's mission, but in announcing the award, the IU McKinney Faculty Executive Committee noted that, \"It is hard to imagine how we could have made it through this year without the truly remarkable efforts of this ex - traordinary group. \" IU McKinney Faculty present awards to their colleagues on an annual basis to recognize special efforts on the part of the coworkers. At the end of the spring semester, Professor Max Huffman received a 2020 Faculty Lead- ership Award for his work on many fronts, but he was especially commended for his leadership in the transition of the school to online learning during the pandemic. \"Under the leadership of Professor Max Huffman, IU McKinney has been an innovator in online legal educa- tion for a number of years, \" said then-Vice Dean Karen Bravo. The selection committee noted, \"In his capacity of the Director of Online Learning, Max has helped us, as a faculty, know what to wear and how to elevate our screens for online teaching, how to take baby steps and to be brave, and, most important, how to be comfortable, prepared, and connected as we approached the online learning environment for spring of 2020 and beyond. \" Huffman Receives Faculty Leadership Award IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 19 For their heroic efforts at keeping Inlow Hall cleaned and sanitized during the pandemic, the entire build- ing services staff was honored with the 2020 Ed Smith \"Above and Beyond\" Award. All members of the build- ing services team have gone above and beyond to keep the building safe for students, faculty and staff. Smith Award recipients included Amber Anderson, Diane Booker, Cornelius Evans, Felicia Johnson, Jonathan Johnson, Lisa Marshall, Deborah Martin, Karen Mur - phy, Eric Perdue, Iesha Smith and Shannon Stone. The Smith Award was established in 2014 in honor and memory of Ed Smith, who served as a member of the law school's building services team for 25 years, from 1975-2000. Ed always went \"above and beyond\" in carrying out his duties and could be counted upon for a good story and a kind word. He was a friend to the entire law school family.

IU McKinney faculty, staff, and alumni took part in a program aimed at sup- porting newly-licensed lawyers as they begin their practices amid the pan- demic and economic fallout. \"Vision 2020 Going Forward: How to See Y our - self Through This, \" was a collaboration of the Indiana State Bar Association, Judges and Lawyers Assistance Program, the Indiana Supreme Court, and local bar associations across the state. The initiative, the idea for which came from Indiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush, and Indiana State Bar Association President Leslie Hen- derzahs, '90, was a four-part series offered online over eight weeks. T opics in- cluded navigating the challenges of beginning your career during a pandemic; coping with the stress of becoming a new lawyer; perspectives from a variety of legal professionals; networking and professional development for new law - yers; opportunities to be matched with a mentor, and more. Former Dean Andrew R. Klein moderated a session to kick off the series. He gathered some IU McKinney alumni who were students or who gradu-ated in 2011 or 2012 to serve as panelists. The panel offered their tips and suggestions for new lawyers who are beginning their careers now. \"The discussion made me think about the period right after the Great Re- cession and some students/grads who successfully navigated challenges entering the profession at that time, \" Dean Klein said. \"They did a great job. \" Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Chasity Thompson, '02, also took part in a panel discussion as part of the series, as did Indiana Supreme Court Justice Ste- ven David, '82. All of the participants shared contact information, Justice David noted, and all of the new ISBA admittees were matched with a mentor. The message from Justice David was one of encouragement and hope. \"Y ou will get through this, \" he told the participants. \"It's OK to not be OK in these times. \" ISBA Y oung Lawyers Section Chair Beau Zoeller, '12, also was part of the program. He, like the 2020 graduates, completed his law school education during a turbulent economic time. \"Navigating uncertainty and a tough job market is stressful. I knew, aside from academic performance, I needed to show involvement and network as much as possible, \" Zoeller said. \"The opportunities were not going to find me, rather I had to find them and take advantage of the resources available, so I got involved in the Indiana State Bar Association on multiple levels and began taking every networking opportunity there was, including just reach- ing out to people. \" Zoeller recognizes that networking is different now than it was when he graduated from IU McKinney, and he encouraged all new lawyers to take ad-vantage of virtual opportunities to connect with their more seasoned peers in the profession. \"I hope recent graduates understand that they are not alone and that the legal community is strong in Indiana, \" Zoeller said. \"There are numerous people and resources available and at their fingertips; all they have to do is reach out and take advantage of those resources and opportunities. \" Initiative Aimed at Helping New Lawyers 20 IU ROBERT H.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 21 IU McKinney faculty and students have been ahead of the curve when it comes to online learning, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that caused a worldwide disruption to higher education during the Spring 2020 semester. Over the past four years, the law school has made important investments in online teaching and learning, thanks to the efforts of IU McKinney faculty and the help of IU's instructional designers. T aught by award-winning faculty who now have, collectively, logged thou- sands of hours of course design and teaching experience, IU McKinney online offerings aren't just an experiment\u2014or an emergency. Instead, IU McKinney is continuing to strengthen its commitment to offer - ing courses that help students achieve the best educational and professional outcomes, according to Professor Max Huffman, the law school's Director of Online Learning. \"Our primary work at McKinney is to teach law students, \" Professor Huffman says. \"We're really focused on respond- ing to the changing needs and realities of the profession and student demand. \" The legal profession\u2014like the rest of society\u2014is much more global, with legal work often communicated at a dis-tance with far-flung clients, or by email with supervisors who expect even beginning lawyers to work independently and online, Professor Huffman says. For law students, online learning isn't always a choice. Sometimes, due to professional or personal obligations, it is a necessity, he says. At a law school like IU McKinney, that has generations of alumni who are grateful for the opportu- nities offered through evening and part-time programs, pro- viding online learning is a natural extension of that mission. Students in the J.D. program may take up to 30 hours of coursework online, subject to course availability (this ABA requirement has been relaxed during the pandemic through the Summer of 2021). Graduate students in the M.J. or LL.M. programs are permitted up to 11 credit hours (LL.M.) or 14 credit hours (M.J.) online under normal circumstances (requirement also relaxed at this time). New courses are being developed in an online format on an ongoing basis. Students' decisions are not always based on need or convenience - some- times, interest alone drives their decisions. Those students frequently be-come converts to the different pedagogy. As a McKinney student, Sam Szynal, '20, took three online courses. \"I pri- marily chose these courses for their subject matter\u2014the fact that they were online did not weigh heavily into my decisions, although there is certainly a benefit in terms of convenience to asynchronous courses, \" he said. Asynchro- nous courses are those where students are learning online, but are not neces- sarily meeting at the same time, or at prescribed times. \"All of these classes involved smaller, bite-sized assignments throughout the semester that required application of the material, whereas a traditional lecture-based class may only call for application on a final exam, \" Szynal said. \"I found that these smaller assignments in the online courses helped illustrate how certain rules build on each other and work together, which ultimately enabled me to better integrate and contextualize information. I always arrived at the end of an online class with information still 'sticking' from the entire semester rather than the feeling of needing to circle back and re-learn everything. \" Lectures may allow limited student-to-student and student-to-professor interaction in the classroom, but participants in live classes are more or less shooting from the hip, he added. \"In an online discussion board format, students and professors are able to compose their remarks more completely, which affords them the opportunity to better develop their thoughts and respond meaningfully and analytically to colleagues, \" Szynal said. \"I found that participating in this type of dialogue made me engage with points I had not considered and opened up my own ideas and analyses to constructive criticism. \" Student Bar Association President Bre Robinson also commented on the online class experience during the Fall 2020 semester, \"Overall, I have been happy with the options that the law school has given students this year. While some students really wanted to attend class in person, there are many stu- dents who fall into the at-risk category or who have family members who do. Admittedly, I did want to engage in in-person learning this semester, but as the pandemic numbers have continued to rise, I have been especially appreciative of the number of classes that were offered online. The variety of asynchro- nous and synchronous classes have allowed law students to continue their education during COVID. \" Faculty Deliver Quality Online Instruction 22 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINEResearch and Scholarship IU McKinney faculty have engaged in substantial research and scholarship in support of their online teaching. Professors Yvonne Dutton and Seema Mohapatra recently co-authored an article forthcoming in the St. Louis Uni- versity Law Review in 2021 that provides practical examples from their own experiences with designing and delivering online courses with the help of IU resources. Other fac- ulty, including Professors Margaret Ryznar and Max Huffman and Vice Dean Cynthia Adams have also published scholarship on online course design and pedagogy. Professor Dutton says her own research is based on anonymous surveys and focus groups with students who had taken asynchronous classes at the law school in a pre-COVID-19 world. Based on that evidence, she is convinced that students desired more online offerings and that they viewed them as delivering a high-quali- ty learning experience. \"We do not suggest that online law classes are 'better' than live courses taught in the class- room, \" Professor Dutton said. \"We love teaching live and interacting with stu-dents. At the same time, we have designed and offered quality online asyn- chronous courses to accommodate student demand. \" In a Crisis, Experience Matters Having experienced and dedicated faculty ready and able to move quickly to emergency remote learning was invaluable when all courses went online in March, Professor Huffman said. \"Having made our investment at a time when we could develop our expe-(OPPOSITE) Professor Cynthia Baker was teaching a course in \"Legal Aspects of Government Finance. \" When faced with cancelling a planned field trip to the construction site of the new Indianapolis Community Justice Campus, she worked with the project's management team to do a virtual field trip online, with the help of a drone camera and Zoom technology. The class could see the $600 million public investment in the city's new approach to criminal justice and continue to examine its relevance as a case study of local government finance.

Faculty adapted their courses, recorded their remaining lectures for students to watch on their own time, and used Zoom for classes and to bring legal experts to speak to students. In April, for example, Professor of Practice Ja- net McCabe invited former Environmental Pro- tection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy to speak via Zoom to her environmental law class\u2014 an opportunity to interact with a top American environmental expert that likely could only have happened with distance learning technology. When the COVID-19 crisis forced Clinical Professor of Law Cynthia Baker to teach \"Legal Aspects of Government Finance\" online, she was confronted with the choice of canceling a planned field trip to the construction site of the new Indianapolis Community Justice Campus or finding an alternative. She worked with the project's management team to do a virtual field trip, with the help of a drone camera and Zoom technology. Professor Baker, who directs the IU McKinney Program on Law and State Government, also directs Experiential Learning at the law school, which has continued to offer externships and clinical experiences for students, with accommo- dations as pandemic conditions demand. \"We didn't just throw up our hands. We kept learning. Our classes and experiential learning have gone forward, \" she said. \"That's just how our profession has to respond. We're prepared for online learning, just as we have to learn to practice law in this environment. \" IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 23 24 IU ROBERT H.

The office has established several programs to promote diversity within the school, including \"Third Floor Thursdays, \" a weekly discussion for stu- dents from underrepresented backgrounds within the legal profession to de-stress and discuss their experiences as law school students in a safe space. Another program, \"McKinney Conversations, \" is an annual event that brings together stakeholders from across the McKinney com- munity (students, faculty, staff and alumni) to engage in facilitated conversations on topics of diversity and inclu- sion. T o promote a culture of inclusivity, the office hosts its \"Creating Affirmative Spaces\" lunch and learn series focused on increasing diversity educa- tion and cultural competency among faculty and staff.

Indianapolis lawyers Shelley Jackson, '07 , partner at Krieg DeVault, T onya Bond, Leagre, '14, at Plews Shadley Racher & Braun, formed the Indy Lawyers for Black Lives organization and planned the Juneteenth event, highlighting the important roles attorneys play in fighting systemic racism and racial injustice. They were assisted by IU McKinney Assistant Dean for Diversity & Inclusion Patricia Kinney, '02. \"Lawyering is our super power, \" Jackson told the crowd. \"We want every person here to commit to getting involved and using your lawyer super powers to help solve the problem of systemic racism and racial injustice. \" The new organization\u2014and the event at the law school\u2014came together within two weeks and immediately found support in the Indianapolis legal community. Speakers from the law school, the Marion County Bar Associ- ation and Indiana Supreme Court Justice Steven David, '82, made specific \"asks\" to speak up, show up and take action. Indianapolis attorney Mark Nicholson, '08, observed that \"we can do a better job of showing the world that Black lives matter. \" During his re-marks, he urged the attendees to kneel in recognition of the Black lives that have been lost due to police misconduct. Attorney Howard Steven- son, '93, talked about his journey in law school and called for his fellow lawyers to mentor minority students. Doneisha Posey, '14, Executive Director of Employee Diversity, Equity and Belonging at Ivy T ech Community College, urged individuals to join the efforts of the Marion County Bar Association. \"Work with us as we educate our communities about their rights, \" she said. IU McKinney Student Bar Association President Bre Robinson remind- ed the crowd why many had come to law school\u2014to make a difference. \"As lawyers we have the power to truly help people and make change in this country, \" she said. \"This is a movement, not a moment. Even when you are tired, the work must continue, \" Robinson said. Chaka Coleman, (2L) vice president of IU McKinney's Black Law Stu- dents Association, spoke about potential in \"students who look like me. Hire, promote, befriend and mentor Black, \" she urged.

On March 9, 2020, Dean Andrew Klein presented a Bicentennial Medal to United States Vice President Michael R. Pence, '86, at his office in Washington, D.C. Vice President Pence is the 48th vice president of the United States, entering that office on January 20, 2017. He was the 50th governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017 and served six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. In Congress, he served as Chairman of the House Republican Study Committee and as House Republican Conference Chairman. He was born in Columbus, Indiana, and graduated from Colum- bus North High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in history from Hanover College in 1981, and graduated from the IU McKin-ney School of Law in 1986. After graduating, Vice President Pence practiced law, led the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, and began hosting The Mike Pence Show , a syndicated talk radio show and a weekly television public affairs program in Indiana. Pence was elect-ed to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000 and represented In-diana's 2nd and 6th congressional districts from 2001 to 2013 when he became the Indiana Governor. In presenting the medal, Dean Klein noted, \"This is a special year at IU. We are celebrating the University's 200th anniversary, and as part of that celebration, the university is bestowing Bicentennial Medals on those who have broadened the reach of IU around our state, the nation and the world through personal, professional and philanthropic efforts.\" On March 10, 2020, Dean Klein presented a Bicentennial Med- al to United States Senator Todd Young, '06. Senator Young joined the U.S. Senate in 2017, following six years as the U.S. Repre-sentative for Indiana's 9th congressional district. He currently serves on the U.S. Senate Committees on Finance; Foreign Relations; Com-merce, Science & Transportation; and Small Business and Entrepre-neurship. Previously, in the House, he served on the House Armed Services Committee, the House Budget Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee. After graduating from Carmel High School, Senator Young en- listed in the U.S. Navy with the goal of attending the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. A year later, he received an appointment from the Secre- tary of the Navy and was admitted to Annapolis, Indiana University Bicentennial Medal Presentations where he participated in varsity athletics and was elected a class of-ficer. Senator Young graduated with honors in 1995 and accepted a commission in the U.S. Marine Corps. After training as a rifle pla-toon commander and service as an intelligence officer, he was then assigned to lead a recruiting effort in Chicago and northwest Indi-ana. During this time, he attended the University of Chicago, where he earned an MBA with a concentration in economics. After serving a decade in the military, in 2000 he was honorably discharged as a Captain. He then spent a year in England, where he earned an M.A. from the School of Advanced Study in Lon-don. Upon returning to the United States, he accepted a position at The Heritage Foundation and later worked as a legislative assistant in the U.S. Senate. In 2003, Senator Young returned home to Indi-ana, working several years as a management consultant and earning the J.D. from the IU McKinney School of Law in 2006. In presenting the award, Dean Klein stated, \"Senator Young is re- markably thoughtful\u2014and he is loyal to the places he came from\u2014including our law school.\" He noted that Senator Young has returned to the school as a guest lecturer for a leadership course that Senator Young had once taken while in law school. On September 11, 2020, IU McKinney School of Law Dean Karen E. Bravo presented Anne Slaughter Andrew, '83, with an IU Bicentennial Medal during a virtual event. The occasion was an introduction to her lecture, \"Mapping an Optimistic Climate Future,\" sponsored by the IU McKinney Pro-gram in Environmental and Natural Resources Law. The lecture was a Zoom webinar that attracted more than 200 attendees\u2014in - cluding Andrew's husband, children and other family members, who were able to watch the medal presentation remotely. The medal presentation (which Andrew was not aware of prior to the event) left Andrew \"surprised and deeply honored,\" she said. \"I am such a proud graduate of IU McKinney law school and have valued the long relationships and legal education that prepared me and certainly have served me well.\" Andrew served as the law school's commencement speaker in 2015, and was presented with a Distinguished Alumnus Award the same year. Andrew is former U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica, appointed by President Barack Obama as the first woman to serve in that post, from 2009-2013. Prior to her appointment, she worked as an environmental and energy lawyer and was an IU McKinney adjunct professor.

T onight, we should be gathering in the Con- vention Center, garbed in regalia, surrounded by family and friends, preparing to celebrate your graduation from the McKinney School of Law. Well, to paraphrase an old proverb, \"We plan, God laughs. \" We now face circumstances none of us could have imagined just weeks ago. A global pandem-ic has confined us to our homes, unable to gath- er for almost any purpose, even one as meaning - ful as your graduation from law school. In time, the COVID crisis will pass and, we will properly commemorate your accomplishments. That does not lessen the disappointment of being apart this evening, but it will make our eventual celebration that much more joyful. For now, please accept my sincere congratu- lations. I am incredibly proud of every one of you. Indeed, as I conclude my tenure as dean, I feel that I am one of you\u2014a proud member of the Class of 2020, a group of people who will over - come adversity and thrive in the years ahead. Later this month, we will send you a link to a video commemorating your graduation. While not a substitute for a true commencement, I hope it will serve as a placeholder to mark this important occasion and serve as a reminder of our friendship and bonds. Until we see one another again, congratula- tions and my very best wishes. \u2014 Andy Klein (ABOVE) IU McKinney Law recognized and congratulated the class of 2020 on a graduation celebration page on the school's website, featuring a video \"procession\" of graduate photos, a message from Dean Andy Klein, right, and congratulatory remarks from faculty.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 29 \"I am honored to give the first Birch Bayh Lecture since Senator Bayh's passing in March of last year,\" said Jesse Wegman, the Birch Bayh Lecturer for 2020. \"And while I'm sad not to be with you in person, I think it's very appropriate for this talk to be taking place on September 17, Constitution Day\u2014the day in 1787 that the fram-ers in Philadelphia signed the charter they had spent the past four months drawing up, arguing about, threatening to walk out over\u2014and yet still, in the end, agreeing to sign and take the next step in this audacious new experiment in self-government. \"It's appropriate because in any conversation about the nation's founders, we must include the name Birch Bayh. He shares with James Madison, the father of the Constitution, the distinction of be-ing the only two Americans to have authored more than one suc-cessful amendment to that document. This is not an easy task. More than 11,000 amendments have been proposed over the centuries, and only 27 have been adopted.\" That's how Wegman, a journalist, author and editorial board member of The New York Times, characterized the late former U.S. Senator Birch Bayh in his lecture, \"A New Engine for a New Age: Birch Bayh, the Electoral College and the Push for National Popu-lar Vote\" during IU McKinney Law's Birch Bayh Lecture. The lecture was presented on September 17, in recognition of the nation's Constitution Day. Due to the pandemic, the virtual event was presented live over Zoom and drew approximately 300 attendees. A recording of the event is available on the law school's website. Wegman is the author of a book, Let the People Pick the President: The Case for Abolishing the Electoral College, published in March 2020. In his IU McKinney Law lecture, he offered a behind-the-scenes recounting of his discussion on the subject with Bayh, and an admiring portrait of the late Hoosier politician's life. Although he tells the story of how Bayh reintroduced his Electoral College amendment in every session of Congress through the 1970s, until he lost re-election in 1980, Wegman also brings the role of the electoral college into the 21st century\u2014\"which is barely two decades old, and yet it has already been defined by the Electoral College's anti-majoritarian distortions. \"If Senator Bayh were here, I know he would say this is a crisis for our democracy. It is a crisis for our republic,\" Wegman said. The Birch Bayh Lecture was established at IU McKinney in honor of former U.S. Senator Birch Bayh. The series is made pos- sible through the generous contributions of the Simon Property Group, where Senator Bayh served on the board for 17 years, and the friends of Birch Bayh. The lectures focus on is- sues of importance to Senator Bayh throughout his long and distinguished career in government. 2020 Birch Bayh Lecture and Constitution Day Program (ABOVE) Jesse Wegman, journalist, author, and editorial board member of The New Y ork Times, served as the 2020 Birch Bayh Lecturer on September 17 .

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINEBirch Bayh was a member of the United States Senate, serving the state of Indiana for three terms from 1962 to 1980. He twice amended the U.S. Con- stitution\u2014affecting the American presidency and enfranchising the youth vote\u2014and wrote other historic legislation revolutionizing women's rights and America's world standing in life sciences and biotechnology. As chairman of the Constitutional Subcommittee, Senator Bayh authored two amendments to the Constitution: the Twenty-fifth Amendment on Presi- dential and Vice Presidential disability and succession, and the Twenty-sixth Amendment that lowered the voting age from 21 to 18 years of age. He wrote two other closely-fought and nearly- passed amendments to the Constitu- tion: the Equal Rights Amendment, and the Direct Popular Vote Amend - ment to abolish the Electoral College. Senator Bayh authored Title IX to the Higher Education Act of 1972 that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in our nation's schools. Ensuring equal opportunities for students in all academic disciplines and on the athletic field, Title IX has been called the Magna Carta of women's rights. Senator Bayh was the architect and co-sponsor of the Bayh-Dole Act that enables American universities, small businesses, and non-profit organiza- tions to retain intellectual property rights of inventions developed from feder- ally-funded research. Senator Bayh's reform of patent law has made the U.S. a global leader in the marketplace and American higher education the world's leading incubator of scientific, medical, and technological innovation. The Economist called Bayh-Dole \"possibly the most inspired piece of legislation to be enacted in America over the past half century.\" Senator Bayh's political career began in 1954 with his election to the Indi- ana House of Representatives, where he served three terms and led sweeping reform of Indiana schools to bring about equality for rural and urban students alike. He earned a B.S. degree in Agriculture from Purdue University and a J.D. from the IU Maurer School of Law. He served in the United States Army with occupied forces in Germany. After leaving public service, Senator Bayh practiced law, worked to protect Title IX, advocated for the direct election of the president through the Na-tional Popular Vote initiative, chaired the first-ever national hate crimes com- mission, and taught at Washington College's C.V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience. The Honorable Birch Bayh IU ROBERT H.

In his remarks, \"Recognizing the 50th Anniversary of the Defeat of Abolishing the Electoral College, \" U.S. Rep. Raskin said: \"Madam Speaker, In September 1969, Sena- tor Birch Bayh, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, introduced a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College. The amendment passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and with support from President Richard Nixon. But on this day 50 years ago, the amendment was blocked by a filibuster in the Senate. \" Rep. Raskin continued: \"At this moment of profound constitutional stress and recurring global and domestic threats to democratic values and practices, we should re- member the Senator's passionate commitment to building democratic self-government that serves as an instrument of the common good. Senator Bayh recognized that, in order to make sure that all votes count in our presidential elections and all votes count equally, it will be necessary to abolish the electoral college--or at least transform it through the National Popular Vote interstate agreement. I was honored to work with Senator Bayh, who was a great gentleman and patriot, during my time as a State Senator and he definitely helped us to make Maryland the first state to pass the National Popular Vote Agreement. \"Madam Speaker, I wish to include in the Record a speech by New Y ork Times Editorial Board Mem- ber Jesse Wegman for the annual Birch Bayh Lec- ture given at University of Indiana McKinney School of Law in honor of Senator Bayh's historic efforts towards electoral reform and in recognition of the melancholy day of defeat of the popular vote in the Senate on September 29, 1969. \" Students, faculty and staff at the law school participated in a variety of activities during the fall semester to commemorate the ratification of the 19th Amendment and to highlight voting rights. From August 17-31, the school hosted an ABA exhibit that pro- vided information about the 19th Amendment and its ratification to build awareness of the anniversary. The travelling exhibit was shown throughout the country, and provided state and local bar associations, lawyers, judges and other legal professionals, educators and civic or-ganizations the opportunity to celebrate 100 years of women's con- stitutional right to vote. The exhibit consisted of displays designed to educate the public about the 19th Amendment and the battle for women's suffrage, and to promote law that ensures women's full and equal exercise of their right to vote and to participate in our democracy. The traveling exhibit was located on the 3rd floor of the Ruth Lilly Law Library in Inlow Hall and was open to students, faculty and staff. On Friday, August 28, the IU McKinney chapter of the American Constitution Society and the IU McKinney Law Women's Caucus host-ed an event commemorating the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment.

IU McKinney's Eighth Annual Job Fair Gets a Makeover IU McKinney hosted the eighth annual job fair in the atrium at Inlow Hall on February 11. This year, fair organizers determined that a bit of a reimagining was in order for the event. Under the direction of Whittley Pike, '14, Senior Associate Director for the Office of Professional Devel- opment (OPD), the job fair is now called \"A.C.E. it!\" (A.C.E.=Advancing Career Exploration). The new direction fit into the OPD programming motto for the Spring 2020 semester: Networking Starts Now! A.C.E. is the result of student and employer input from previous events. Changes implemented include a mock cocktail reception, during which students learned how to network and craft an elevator pitch, and additional training specifically geared toward getting the most out of the \"A.C.E. it!\" event. Representatives from law firms, state and county government offices, and not-for-profit organizations participated in the event. Pro Bono Fair In keeping with McKinney's commitment to provide all students with resources related to pro bono opportunities, the law school hosted a Pro Bono Fair on March 10, 2020. Participating organizations had the opportunity to engage in dialogue with McKinney law students and dis- cuss pro bono and public interest opportunities. Student Organization and Resource Fair The annual Student Organization and Resource Fair, always part of the back-to-school festivities for law students, took place outdoors in the Inlow Hall Courtyard on Tuesday, September 8.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINEProfessor Carrie Hagan was named the IUPUI Graduate and Professional Mentor of the Year for the 2019-2020 academic year. She received this honor from the IUPUI Graduate Mentoring Center. She was nominated for the honor by seven individuals who lauded her as an outstanding ex- ample of mentoring on campus. Many nominators mentioned Professor Hagan's relationships with her students. \"She understands how an individual student's intersectional identity, race, gender identity, sexuality, class status, etc. might impact their lived experience as a law student. She meets us where we are and treats us like whole human beings,\" one nominator wrote. Professor Hagan also was noted for her work which opens oppor-tunities for her students. \"Professor Hagan takes the time to understand students' strengths and push them to grow. Impor- tantly, she encourages students to use these strengths and newly-ac- quired skills to serve the Indianap-olis community. This is a powerful combination, and one that both nurtures students during a vulner- able time and inspires them to push beyond the traditional understanding of what a law degree can do for society,\" another nominator wrote. Carrie Hagan joined the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law faculty as a Clinical Associate Professor of Law in the Fall of 2009 and is currently Director of the Civil Practice Clinic. In addition to teaching full time at the clinic, she has presented on and published her work involving interdisciplinary partnerships and coordinating skill sets between law and social work locally, nationally and internationally. She earned her B.A. degree at the University of Kansas and the J.D. at the University of Cincinnati College of Law. The award is given to encourage and recognize outstanding mentoring of the graduate and professional students and identify best practices for graduate mentoring at IUPUI. Professor Hagan Named Mentor of the Year how American segregation was a function of explicit federal, state, and local policies. He has authored many other books and articles on race and education, includ- ing Class and Schools: Using Social, Economic and Edu- cational Reform to Close the Black-White Achievement Gap and Grading Education: Getting Accountability Right. He has also served as the national education col-umnist for The New York Times and lectures widely on issues of equity, race, and education. In pre-recorded videos that can be found on the law school's website, PLSG fellow Adam Steel (J.D. anticipat- ed May 2021), presented his research topic, \"The Cost of Success: How States Target Funds Toward Districts that Need It,\" and PLSG fellow Alexis Weaver (J.D. anticipat- ed May 2021), presented \"Measuring Students through Teacher Focused Metrics: State Intervention, Evaluation, and Regulation.\" Both Fellows cite their own experiences in education as sources for their interest in the topics. Steel is a former mid- dle school teacher from Evansville, Indiana, while Weaver worked for a pre-school program for low-income children in Massachusetts prior to attending law school. \"As a former teacher, this is a topic that is very important to me,\" Steel said. \"Public education is the backbone of our society and it is important to bring to light some of the is- sues our school systems are currently facing.\" This year, both fellows faced both the challenges of law school, clerkships, and the COVID-19 pandemic, all while planning a symposium that, for the first time in its 20-year history, was presented entirely online. \"When Adam and I selected this topic with the guidance of Professor Cynthia Baker, none of us had any idea that COVID-19 was looming just around the corner,\" Weaver said. \"This topic is now more timely than ever. One of the biggest challenges we are facing aside from the spread of the disease itself, is how to navigate school for K-12 stu-dents. How do we mitigate growing achievement gaps, make remote learning equitable, and keep kids succeeding? How do we even measure success in this novel time? It's all new territory.\" The PLSG Symposium was the school's first completely virtual symposium, offering both live and pre-recorded presentations.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 35 HALL CENTER FOR LAW AND HEALTH IHLR Symposium Engages in National Conversation on Health and Housing National experts called attention to a crisis in health and housing in the United States at the two-day virtual Indiana Health Law Review Symposium on October 15-16. The symposium, \"The Intersection of Health Equity and Housing Law\" explored the intersection of health law and housing law with a focus on using the law to achieve equity in these areas. Symposium moderator Abraham Gutman, an opinion and editorial writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer, called the topic \"tragically relevant,\" in light of the COVID-19 epidemic and a housing affordability crisis. IU McKinney Law alumna Emily Benfer, '05, Visiting Professor of Law, Wake Forrest School of Law, drew attention to the impacts and root causes of discrimination and poverty on the social determinants of health in her Day One keynote address, \"Housing Justice in America: A Framework for the Elimination of Discrimination, Eviction, and Health Disparities in Communities of Color.\" Professor Benfer is an authority in the field of health and housing jus- tice. She is the Chair of the American Bar Association's COVID-19 Task Force Committee on Eviction and co-creator of the COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard with the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S., many Americans were impacted by instability in housing, as well as unsafe conditions that especially impact children, according to Professor Benfer. \"The pandemic magnified that disparity,\" she said, with 30-40 mil- lion adults at risk of eviction, and an estimated 50 million renters in households that suffered COVID-19-related job or income loss. In her symposium talk, Professor Benfer noted that during her time as a law student, she was inspired to learn more about the role race plays in housing law in a class taught by Florence Wagman Roisman, William F. Harvey Professor of Law and Chancellor's Professor at IU McKinney. Housing precarity and racially discriminatory policies mean that the principles of health justice do not apply equally to all members of our society, Professor Benfer said. \"We have a duty to address this,\" she said. The first day of the symposium also included: \"Affordability in Housing,\" a panel with Peggy Bailey, M.P.A., Vice President for Hous- ing Policy, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; Jamila Michener, J.D., M.A., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Government, Cornell Uni-versity; and Elizabeth Tobin-Tyler, J.D., M.A., Associate Professor of Family Medicine and Medical Science at the Alpert Medical School and of Health Services, Policy and Practice at the Brown University School of Public Health; and \"Stability in Housing,\" a panel with Anne Kat Alexander, COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard Project Lead; Kathi Hoke, J.D., Professor, University of Maryland Carey School of Law and Director, Network for Public Health Law, Eastern Region; and Victoria Suarez-Palomo, Senior Advisor, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP and Senior Advisor, COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project. The keynote speaker for the second day was Courtney Anderson, J.D., LL.M., Associate Professor of Law at Georgia State University College of Law, who spoke on the topic of \"Sur-viving Gentrification and Segregation.\" Professor Anderson is affiliated faculty at the Georgia State University School of Public Health and the university's Next Generation Initiative, which fo- cuses on interdisciplinary research into how law and policy might impact social, economic, and environmental determinants of health. The second day of the symposium also featured the following panels: \"Im- pact of Environmental Elements on Health & Housing,\" a panel with Emily Coffey, J.D., Housing Justice Staff At-torney, Shriver Center on Poverty Law; Janet McCabe, J.D., IU McKinney Pro- fessor of Practice and Director of the Indiana University Environmental Re- silience Institute; Carlton Waterhouse, J.D., Ph.D., Professor of Law and Direc- tor Environmental Justice Center, How-ard University School of Law; and \"Im- pact of Racial Segregation on Health & Housing,\" a panel with Doneisha Posey, '14, Vice President of Diversity, Equity & Belonging, Ivy Tech Community Col- lege; Florence Wagman Roisman, LL.B., William F.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINEHALL CENTER FOR LAW AND HEALTH Challenges and Rewards of a Virtual Event \"Planning the first-ever virtual Indiana Health Law Review Fall Symposium was a challenging and also very rewarding task,\" said Warren Cangany, Executive Symposium Editor of the Indiana Health Law Review . Because it was the first time IHLR hosted a virtual event, there was no blueprint or foundation to draw upon of what would work or how the event should look, Cangany said. At the same time, the virtual format allowed for \"an all-star lineup\" of national experts on the topics of Health and Housing Law from around the country, and to reach a wider audience, he said. \"When I started planning the symposium, many people were already experiencing Zoom fatigue, so designing a format that would attract attendees and still offer the same amount of quality and education content was probably the biggest piece in planning the symposium outside of selecting a timely and important topic,\" he said. Symposium Featured Student Posters During breaks between sessions, attendees were asked to vote on student posters. IU McKinney stu-dents recognized for their research posters included winner Alexis Weaver, \"Safer is Better: Paving the Path for Safe Consumption Sites in Indiana\" and runner-up Jessica Kolanowski \"Why So Trust- ing? At-Home DNA Tests and Electronic Informed Consent\" in the Best Completed Note category. Voters chose Allyson Crane, \"Racial Disparities in Mental Health Treatment: How Indiana Misses the Mark in Providing Accessible and Quality Treatment Amidst the Coronavirus Pandemic\" as the winner in the category of Best Note in Progress and Erin McNeil as runner up for \"Mass Incarceration as a Public Health Crisis.\" About the Indiana Health Law Review The Indiana Health Law Review (IHLR) focuses on health care law and policy and provides in- formative articles on important health law topics and issues.

Professor of Law Nicolas T erry published an op-ed in The Hill recognizing a long list of failures related to COVID-19. Since the pandemic began, he's also been speaking out about nursing homes and COVID-19, in- cluding in an article in The Conversation. The Washington Post consulted him for an analy - sis about the T rump administration's pri-vacy concerns over the president's COVID-19 diagnosis in October, and the Wall Street Journal interviewed him about the future of health data privacy after the pandemic ends. Anthem Inc. and other health insurers are racking up record profits, but those windfalls are drawing criticism, according to an August 21 story in the Indianapolis Business Journal, which cited both T erry and Professor Fran Quigley, '87 , director of the Health and Hu- man Rights Clinic at the IU McKinney. Among the many news stories featur - ing IU McKinney Associate Professor and Dean's Fellow Seema Mohapatra's com- ments, there was a Vox piece titiled \"What Public Health Experts Want Critics to Know about Why They Support the Protests. \" An article by Professor Ross Silverman for The Conversation, \"Vaccine Mandates vs. Religious Beliefs\u2014the Legal Arguments for the Upcoming Coronavirus Lawsuits, \" outlines what might follow religious objec- tions to a COVID-19 vaccine.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 37 HALL CENTER FOR LAW AND HEALTH As the nation continues to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 50 top na- tional experts offer a new assessment of the U.S. policy response to the crisis. The research details the widespread failure of the country's leadership in planning and executing a cohesive, national response, and how the crisis exposed weaknesses in the nation's health care and public health systems. In Assessing Legal Re- sponses to COVID-19, the authors also offer recommenda- tions on how federal, state and local leaders can better re-spond to COVID-19 and future pandemics. Their proposals include how to strengthen executive leadership for a stron- ger emergency response, expand access to public health, health care and telehealth; fortify protections for workers; and implement a fair and humane immigration policy. Nicolas P . T erry, Hall Render Professor of Law and Execu- tive Director of the Hall Center for Law and Health at IU McK - inney, served on the editorial committee and contributed an article, \"Liability and Liability Shields, \" to the report. Professor Ross D. Silverman, Professor of Public Health and Law at IU McKinney and Professor of Health Policy and Management at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI, also contributed an article, \"Contact T racing, Intrastate and Interstate Quarantine, and Isolation\" \" Judged by any metric, the U.S. response to COVID-19 has been a historic failure, \" Professor T erry said. \"Great at - tention has been justly paid to political failures and how sci-ence and public health have been politicized. \" Expert assessments in the report show that the coun- try's failure in COVID-19 response in many ways has been a legal failure, Professor T erry said. \"The basic design of our health care system and its legal underpinnings have failed us in multiple ways, \" he said. \"And then there are the more detailed laws such as those dealing with housing and evictions, the protection of nursing home residents, worker protections, and so many more that have been revealed as inadequate or poorly implemented or both. \" Sponsored by the de Beaumont Foundation and the American Public Health Association, the report was produced by Public Health Law Watch in cooperation with the Hall Center, the Center for Public Health Law Research at T emple Univer - sity's Beasley School of Law, the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern University, Wayne State University Law School, the Network for Public Health Law and ChangeLab Solutions. Key findings Key findings in the report include: Ample legal authority has not been properly used in practice\u2014evidence shows a mas- sive failure of executive leadership and implementation at the federal level, and in many states and localities; decades of pandemic preparation overemphasized documenting plans and failed to account for how severe budget cuts to public health, from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention, to state and local health departments, would drive outcomes. These budget cuts were combined with political interference that had a deleterious effect on the operational readiness of the nation's local, state and federal health agen-cies; and legal responses have failed to prevent racial and economic disparities in the pandemic's toll, and in some cases aggravated them. The report provides critical legal analysis and recommenda- tions, rooted in empirical evidence and expert analysis. Each author wrote about how the law has been used, misused or under-used in the response to COVID-19. It addresses not just the legal doctrine, but also matters of implementation, includ- ing both the use of strategies and resources. The authors ex - press concern with the efficacy of containing COVID-19, as well as protecting human and civil rights, equity and ethics. The authors provide more than 100 recommendations for legal action in response to COVID-19. These include calls for urgent action now, as well as longer term changes that reflect the way the pandemic has exposed deeper problems in American law and policy. They include recommendations for federal, state and local levels. T o view the full report, please visit COVID19Policy - Playbook.org .

Passionate about health law, IU McKinney 2L Han- nah Smith found her perfect externship match over the summer of 2020 with the Indiana Rural Health Association. Smith is from Flint, Michigan, and was working for U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee of Michigan's fifth congressional district, during the city's water crisis, which left the city's 100,000 residents with un- healthy levels of lead in their water. \"Through that experience, I was able to see how public health touches every aspect of life and how important health policy is to every person, \" Smith said. \"Indiana has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the country, so I was very excited to work on a project for the Indiana Rural Health Association's Healthy Start program. The organization is really impressive in their work to bring quality healthcare to people who need it. \" Smith worked on compliance issues, researching federal and state guidelines to write policies for the Indiana Rural Health Association to reach their audiences through social media platforms without breaching privacy. She praised Edye T .

(LEFT) Derek Lavender, '14, a registered patent attorney at T aft Stettinius & Hollister, will serve as clinic faculty supervisor on the trademark side.There is truth to the adage that \"necessity is the mother of invention,\" and the IP Center's new clinic is living proof. IU McKinney's new intellectual property law clinic was born when IU McKinney Law 3L, Mike Webb, was seek- ing an externship opportunity for Summer 2020 because he needed to replace his externship that fell victim to the coronavirus pandemic. IU McKinney alumni have provided invaluable leadership and help. Webb worked at Rolls-Royce for 13 years before enroll- ing in law school at IU McKinney, where he's part of the evening division. Webb is now a technical analyst in the IP department at Indianapolis-based Barnes & Thornburg. He was set to extern with in-house counsel at Rolls-Royce during Summer 2020, but the pandemic made that im- possible. Thanks to Professor Cynthia Baker, Director of Experiential Learning at the law school, Webb was able to develop a Supervised Externship Placement (SEP) during which he and alumna Pervin Taleyarkhan, '13, in-house IP legal counsel at Whirlpool, collaborated on efforts to start the IP clinic. Webb was able to gain some practical experience working with Taleyarkhan as well. Webb worked with Taleyarkhan and alumni Matthew Clark, '13, and Derek Lavender, '14, toward starting a clin-ic for the Center for Intellectual Property and Innovation. Clark is an attorney at Frost Brown Todd where he practices in the areas of trademark, copyright, entertainment, and in- ternet law; and Lavender is a registered patent attorney at Taft Stettinius & Hollister. Set to launch in the Spring, the clinic will operate under the auspices of the United States Patent and Trademark Office IP Clinic Certification Program. Taleyarkhan is set to serve as the clinic's director and as an adjunct professor, while Clark and Lavender will serve as clinic faculty super- visors on the patent and trademark side, respectively. All their work will make it possible for the clinic to function un- der the USPTO's Law School Clinic Certification Program and deliver opportunities for students to gain practical, col- laborative experiences in drafting, filing, and prosecuting trademark and patent applications for real-world clients, all while still in law school. The experience of helping launch the IP clinic hasn't ex- actly taken the place of the externship Webb would have had at his former employer, but it has been a valuable experi-ence, he said. \"Although it wasn't hands-on in a corporation, it has actually worked out great in multiple other areas,\" IU McKinney's IP Center Launches Clinic Under USPTO Program 40 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINECENTER FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW AND INNOVATION Professor Xuan-Thao Nguyen's recent work will be published by law reviews at New Y ork University and the University of California Berkeley. The pieces relate to the COVID-19 pan- demic, and the #MeT oo movement. \"Contract Impossibility: From Spanish Influenza of 1918 to COVID-19 Pandemic, \" will be pub- lished by the Annual Survey of American Law at NYU School of Law. #MeT oo Innovators: Dis- rupting the Race and Gender Code by Asian-Americans in the T ech Industry, \" will be published by Berkeley Law's Asian American Law Journal. In the #MeT oo piece, Professor Nguyen exam- ines the means by which Asian American women are disrupting norms in the tech industry that keep them from competing successfully with their male and white female peers. A late 2019 article by Professor Nguyen also explores #MeT oo innovators. The article, \"Dis- rupting Adhesion Contracts with #MeT oo Innovators, \" was published by the Virginia Jour- nal of Social Policy & the Law . Just as innovators are known for disrupting old business models through technological innovations, #MeT oo reformers are disrupting the seemingly insurmountable adhesion contract regime. Their efforts have led to businesses removing their arbitration clauses, as these pioneers regain their rights without relying on the conventional contract theory of unconscionability. Professor Nguyen holds the Gerald L. Bepko Chair in Law, and is the director of the IU McK - inney Center for Intellectual Property Law and Innovation. She frequently travels to Vietnam and other countries to present her scholarship and to train government officials. She is an internationally recognized legal scholar, known for her expertise at the intersections of intel- lectual property, secured transactions, bankruptcy, licensing, and taxation. She was named a Fellow of the American College of Commercial Finance Lawyers in March 2017 .

It introduced me to some in-house topics and new ways of thinking about inventor interviews. Pervin has been a great contact and invited me to join a local IP Inn of Court. And I have really enjoyed being able to help establish the IP clinic, which will hopefully get more students involved in IP!\" Students who take part in the clinic will directly interact with and help clients address their IP needs in the patents and trademarks spaces, Taleyarkhan said. She said she was looking for an opportunity to pay forward some of the mentorship and opportunities she's been given in her career. \"This has been quite an adven- ture,\" Taleyarkhan said of efforts to get the clinic up and running. \"I see this as an opportunity to contribute to the future of our profession, help our community, and importantly, take advantage of my unique in-house perspectives to enrich the clinic students' experiences. I owe a lot to this law school, and I am looking forward to helping bring this clinic to life, and hope- fully become a self-sustaining, well-oiled machine that will last well beyond my time of direct involvement.\" Gaining as much practical experience as possible while in law school is a critical part of future success, Lavender said. For him, that experience came through work he did as a law clerk at what would become his firm after graduation, Taft Stettinius & Hollister. \"I believe that it is crucial to start practicing what you are learning in law school as soon as possible,\" Lavender said. \"This clinic gives students a great opportunity to obtain real-world experi- ence practicing law while helping clients obtain IP protection and potentially mon - etize their innovation. This clinic can be a great resource to help both students and innovators alike.\" IU ROBERT H.

In the opening session, Dr. Jeff Dukes, Ph.D., Director of Purdue Climate Research Center, pre- sented the most current data on \"How Climate Change is Impact- ing Indiana's Water Resources and People,\" noting that \"Indiana is getting wetter and warmer.\" That trend is expected to intensify, and will impact Indiana's agri- culture, water quality, and ecosystems, he said. Preparation for Indi- ana communities is key, Dukes said, a point emphasized by moderator Janet McCabe, IU McKinney Professor of Practice and Director of the IU Environmental Resilience Institute and Prepared for Environmen - tal Change Grand Challenge. \"A Brief History of the Clean Water Act, Changes During the Trump Administration, and Focus on the Waters of the U.S. and Recent Court Decisions\" followed, presented by Jon Devine, Senior Attorney and Di- rector Federal Water Policy Nature Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Fred Andes, Partner, Barnes & Thornburg.

The virtual event attracted more than 200 attendees. Andrew opened her lecture noting that when she chose the title of her talk more than six months ago, she had no idea what it would mean to look to an optimis- tic future during the COVID-19 pandemic and forest fires that blazed across the U.S. west coast states, causing planned energy outages to minimize the danger to residents and their homes. \"No doubt climate impact is here, and now, \" she said. \"We need to look at the legal and regulatory systems we have created around energy and electricity. How do we take those systems and revolutionize them to achieve a just transition to a sus- tainable energy future?\" That's why electricity is such an intriguing piece of the climate change challenge, Andrew says. Most people lack a basic understanding of the modern electricity system, from how electricity powers their homes when they turn on the lights, to understanding their electric bills. \"We're pretty disconnected from the way in which we are all tied into climate change, \" Andrew says. \"If we help people think about energy and engage in conversation about how they use energy, it could just have a cre- scendo of an impact. Having people empowered with knowledge and access to information will accelerate our ability to build a sustainable energy future. \" \"If we can do that right, we can devise a map to arrive at an optimistic climate future, \" she says.Prior to the start of the lecture, IU McKinney Dean Karen Bravo presented a Bicentennial Medal to Andrew, for her professional achievements and her dedication to her alma mater. Andrew is former U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica, appointed by President Barack Obama as the first woman to serve in that post, from 2009-2013. Prior to her appointment, she worked as an environmental and energy lawyer and was an IU McKinney adjunct professor. In recent years, she has carved out a ca- reer as a social entrepreneur, investing, advising, and advocating clean energy and sustainable development. Recent projects include co-founding T erViva, LLC, an agrotechnology company developing environmentally sustainable crops for food and fuel; launching the Climate Forum with the NewDEAL, a rising stars network of exceptional state and local elected officials; investing and advising LNG, LLC, a Central Ameri- can venture to collect and recycle used lubricant oil; and co-founding EARTH University's global platform for Leadership and Sustainable Solutions Impact. Andrew serves on the board of directors of Sunnova Energy Interna- tional (NOVA), a residential solar and energy storage service provider, and Ad Astra Rocket Company in Houston, T exas.

Purdue's agricultural economics expertise offers an in- depth understanding of the food system's economics and the economic concepts and theories required to make ef - fective decisions in a dynamic industry. IU McKinney's legal training emphasizes understanding regulatory oversight, administrative agencies' roles, policy questions, and transac- tional structures, according to IU McKinney Vice Dean Cyn- thia Adams, Clinical Professor of Law. \"Agricultural law is a complex, and growing area, \" Dean Adams said. \"IU McKinney is pleased to offer this multidis- ciplinary education in agricultural economics and law, which will allow MJ/MS graduates to make creative and significant contributions in the food and agribusiness sector and con- tribute to policy-making in this field. \" According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Indiana ranks 11th in the nation in agriculture sales, contributing an estimated $31.2 billion in sales to Indiana's economy each year. More than $4.6 billion of those agri-cultural products are exported around the world. The joint institutional proximity of IU McKinney and Purdue to agri- businesses and other agriculture-based employers provides cutting-edge access to training and practical applications of legal and agricultural economics concepts in the field. \"We are excited to embark on this joint collaboration, \" said Jayson L. Lusk, Distinguished Professor and Head, Purdue University Department of Agricultural Economics. \"Students trained in both law and agricultural economics should be uniquely prepared to have a positive impact in food and ag - riculture. \" The 51-credit MJ/MS program requires students to earn 30 McKinney Law credits and 21 Purdue University Agricul-tural Economics credits. New Joint Degree Program with Purdue is First in the U.S. Maureen Shiel hopes to take her passion for human rights work and how that intersects with philanthropy into the next stage of her career. She is the first student to enter the M.J./M.A. joint-degree program. When she elected to pursue the joint degree, she was a student in the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy graduate certificate program. Shiel is no stranger to philanthropic work. She previously served in development at Indianapolis Contemporary, formerly known as the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art. Shiel also is an artist, a painter who works with acrylics. Her art is contemporary, and she likes to represent natural elements in her work, like water and nature. Her background in yoga also sometimes manifests itself in her art through abstract symbols that reflect the principles of yogic tradition or philosophy. Shiel completed her undergraduate studies at Purdue University, where she majored in hospitality and tourism manage- ment. She worked at a tourism nonprofit entity after graduation, then left that post when her children were young. Back in the workforce at Indianapolis Contemporary, her interest in philanthropy was piqued. \"I've discovered a passion for human rights work, \" Shiel said. She hopes to work in an area where basic human needs for things like healthcare, housing, and sanitation overlap with work in philanthropy. IU McKinney has developed four joint degree programs: the joint M.J./B.S. in Informatics, offered with the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI; the joint M.J./M.A. in Philanthropic Stud- ies, offered with the IU Lilly Family School of Philanthropy; the joint M.J./Ph.D. in Urban Education Studies with the IU School of Educa- tion at IUPUI; and the joint M.J./M.S. in Agriculture Law with Purdue University. Maureen Shiel is IU McKinney's First M.J./M.A. Dual-Degree Student IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 51 GRADUATE STUDIES Brenda Alexandra Salas Lopez, an attorney from Peru who is pursuing a Master of Laws degree at IU McKinney, worked as a volunteer at the Center for Victim and Hu- man Rights in Indianapolis. The center provides legal representation to crime victims and conducts educational outreach. Salas Lopez called it \"one of the most wonderful and enriching experiences\" she has had during her time as a student at IU McKinney. \"The opportunity to vol- unteer at this institution fed my knowledge about the American system, \" Salas Lopez said. As a volunteer, she conducted research and helped se- cure orders of protection. Salas Lopez worked with Leontiy Korolev, '12, who attor - ney. Raio Krishnayya, LL.M. '11, founded the center in 2008 and serves as its ex - ecutive director. \"This was an invaluable chance because I learned in an amazing and kind environment, \" Salas Lopez said. IU McKinney encourages its international LL.M. students to give back to the com- munity by rendering pro bono service as part of their legal education. Many such stu-dents have taken advantage of these opportunities by volunteering at the Neighbor - hood Christian Legal Clinic or Indiana Legal Services, among other providers. Salas Lopez serves as treasurer of the Master of Laws Association. She is pursuing the International Human Rights Law track in the Master of Laws program at IU McKinney. IU McKinney LL.M. Student Interns with Center for Victim and Human Rights Miki Pike Hamstra has been named Assistant Dean of Graduate Programs at IU McKinney Law. She previously served as Director of Graduate Programs, a role she undertook in February 2016. Hamstra is a familiar face at Inlow Hall. She served in the Graduate Programs office from 2004 to 2007 , when IU McKin- ney's Master of Laws pro-gram was just beginning. Now in her position as As-sistant Dean of Graduate Programs, Hamstra's re-sponsibilities include stra- tegic planning, international and domestic recruitment, administration, student ser - vices, and advising to the law school's Master of Laws (LL.M), Master of Jurispru- dence (M.J.), and Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD) degree programs.

She is currently pursuing a doctorate in Learning Sciences at IU and is a published researcher and frequent presenter at national and regional conferences, including the Indiana Association for the Gifted (IAG), Association for Middle Level Education (AMLE), and T eachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). She and husband James Hamstra, '06, have three sons. Miki Pike Hamstra Named Assistant Dean of Graduate Programs A dozen Master of Laws students began their studies at IU McKinney during the Fall 2020 semester. Some traveled from far away, while others are from Indiana. The 12 students are from six different countries and join a total class of 30 LL.M. students from 17 different countries. In its 18th year, IU McKinney's LL.M. program offers opportunities for lawyers practicing in the United States to deepen their expertise in a par - ticular area of law, preparation for lawyers licensed in other countries who wish to pass the bar exam in the United States, and help legal scholars advance their legal knowledge or prepare for a career in academia. Master of Laws students at IU McKinney are admitted to the LL.M. program prior to making their track choice. During orientation, students talk with faculty, staff, and students about the different program tracks, and then meet with an academic advisor, who assists them in deciding which track best matches each student's career goals and interests. T rack choices include: American Law for Foreign Lawyers; Corporate and Commercial Law; Health Law, Policy, and Bioethics; Intellectual Property Law; International and Comparative Law; International Human Rights Law, and World T rade Law. IU McKinney Welcomes New LL.M. Students for Fall Semester 52 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINEFaculty News Cynthia Baker completed her work as a contributing author to the textbook, State and Local Government in a Federal System (9th ed. 2020). Professor Baker updated the chapter on state and local gov - ernment powers, including changes in home rule provisions and state preemption practices proposed by the National League of Cit - ies in February 2020. She also contributed to the book's chapter on public finance. This edition is particularly timely in that it integrates coverage of emerging legal issues relating to the COVID-19 pandem- ic and devotes increased attention to social justice issues including possible implications for government liability. Professor Baker advised the two 2020 Program on Law and State Government Fellows, Alexis Weaver and Adam Steel, through their fellowship year. Adam and Alexis used their fellowship opportunity to explore differences among states regarding teacher standards, school funding, and student assessment. In particular, both fel-lows developed their respective scholarship on how those differ - ences in state government law and policy impact failing schools. The culmination of their work resulted in the first-ever fully virtual PLSG fellowship symposium T axes, T eachers, and T ests: Govern- ment Responses to Failing Schools that launched October 23. The symposium featured a live webinar component with legal scholar and author Derek W. Black and historian Richard Rothstein. The fel- lows prepared their pre-recorded fellowship presentations with the help of a team of wonderful alumni, including former PLSG fellows Marcus McGhee, '16, April Keaton, '18, and Rachel Blakeman, '13. With terrific support from the IU community, the symposium also included a podcast, hosted by fellow Adam Steel, on state funding of struggling public schools, another first for the Program on Law and State Government fellowship endeavor. On January 28, 2020, Professor Baker moderated a panel dis- cussion Ethics and Externships in conjunction with the Experiential Learning Fair which took place at the law school. The panel comprised IU McKinney alumni and supervising lawyers for externships, Dale Pennycuff, '17 , of the Indiana Horse Racing Commission and James Strickland, '18, a judicial law clerk for the Honorable Mark Massa, '89, of the Indiana Supreme Court, as well as former externship super - vising attorney and adjunct professor, Edye Edens, '08, who advises the law school's health law externships. The discussion referenced various starting points for professional ethics, ranging from the phil- osophical to the legal, and explored ways that externship students, supervising attorneys and judges, and faculty advisors can work to-gether to gain a deeper understanding of our respective roles as ethi-cal participants within our shared profession. Professor Baker continued her work to improve the communal clinic spaces with art, including the law school's commission of three works by Indianapolis artist and photographer John Gentry. The pieces were formally installed before the beginning of the fall academic semester. Professor Baker looks forward to welcoming the IU community to the clinic spaces in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brad Desnoyer was awarded a 2020 Indiana University T rustees' T eaching Award. Professor Desnoyer presented at the IUPUI Schol-arly T eaching Symposium, with the theme Education Law: Creating an Online Asynchronous Course to Make Students Practice-Ready in Oc- tober 2020. He talked about creating an online course that assigned students regular, \"practice-ready\" assignments, such as e-memos. In addition, he was elected as a lead editor for the official scholarly journal of the Association of Legal Writing Directors, titled Legal Com- munication & Rhetoric: Journal of the Legal Writing Directors. Jennifer Drobac published the book Sexual Harassment Law: His- tory, Cases, & Practice (with Professors Carrie Baker and Rigel Oli- veri) (2d ed. Carolina Academic Press, 2020).

Her article, co-authored with Mark Russell, \"Unmasking Sex - ual Harassment: The Empirical Evidence for A New Approach, \" was accepted for publication in Spring 2021 by the New York University Journal of Law and Business . In addition, she was the keynote speaker on the topic Sexual Harassment: COVID-19, Politics and a New Book, during one of the Indiana University School of Medicine's Virtual Salons. The event took place on June 8, 2020.Dean Bravo and Two Alumnae Represent IU McKinney on 'Women of Influence' List for 2020 IU McKinney Dean Karen Bravo is among the women named to the Indianapolis Business Journal's 2020 \"Women of Influence\" list. She was joined by law school alumnae Cynthia Carrasco, '06, and Marilee Springer, '96. The award program took place in a virtual format October 28. Dean Bravo is the 13th dean of the law school since its af - filiation with IU in 1944, the first person of color and the second woman in the school's history to lead the urban-based institu-tion. She first joined the faculty of the McKinney School in 2004 as an assistant professor of law. Over the course of 16 years, she has served as associate dean for international affairs, associate dean for graduate studies and international affairs, and most recently as vice dean for the school. Dean Bravo recently was selected to lead the new Race and the Legal Process Working Group, which was created by the Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee (GIPC). Carrasco, '06, is deputy general counsel in the office of Indi- ana Governor Eric Holcomb. She previously served as the state's inspector general, and in the state's Ethics Commission. She re-ceived IU McKinney's award for Early Career Achievement in 2016. Marilee Springer, '96, is a partner at Faegre Drinker, where she focuses on corporate, governance, and tax and structuring issues. IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 53 Faculty News Yvonne Dutton and Professor Seema Mohapatra had an article ac- cepted for publication, \"COVID-19 and Law T eaching: Guidance on Developing an Asynchronous Online Course for Law Students, \" forth- coming, ST . LOUIS U. L. J., 2021. In addition, Professor Dutton and Pro- fessor Margaret Ryznar had an article accepted for publication, \"Law School Pedagogy Post-Pandemic: Harnessing the Benefits of Online T eaching \"with the Journal of Legal Education (forthcoming 2021). Frank Emmert , the director of the Center for International and Com- parative Law, was teaching International Investment Law and Inter - national Commercial Arbitration in the classroom at McKinney in the Spring. As did everyone else, he shifted his instruction to online deliv - ery in March because of the pandemic. During the Summer, Professor Emmert taught European Union Law online and in the Fall, he taught International Business T ransactions, International Commercial Arbi- tration, and International T rade Law online at McKinney, as well as another set of International Business T ransactions in the classroom at the Maurer School in Bloomington. His online course on Academic Writing for Lawyers has been particularly popular since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, as more students are writing papers in- stead of other forms of assessments. Professor Emmert delivered the manuscripts for three books in late spring 2020. International Business T ransactions - T ext, Cases, and Materials, was published by Carolina Academic Press (1142 pag - es, ISBN 978-1-5310-0567-2) and immediately received praise from colleagues like Professor George Bermann at Columbia University School of Law, and Datuk Professor Sundra Rajoo, the former presi-dent of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. The textbook is accom- panied by IBT Documents Vol. I - T ransactional Law Documents (810 pages, ISBN 978-1-9501-3799-2) and Vol. II - Dispute Settlement Doc-uments (588 pages, ISBN 978-1-9501-3701-5), both published by the Council on International Law and Politics. During the Fall semester, students were already very appreciative of these new materials, con- taining all important conventions and laws governing IBT s, as well as more than a dozen model contracts with extensive explanations. The books make an important contribution to the offerings at IU McKin- ney, where the students can acquire certificates, inter alia, in inter - national and comparative law, and in corporate and commercial law, by signing up for a number of mutually complementary classes, and build a solid foundation for their subsequent practice as attorneys or in-house legal counsel. Nicholas Georgakopoulos collaborated on three articles with Pro- fessor Frank Sullivan, Jr., who previously served as a Justice on the Indiana Supreme Court. The articles are: \"Six Dimensions of Crimi- nal Procedure, \" 28 Supreme Court Economic Review 181 (2020); \"Illustrating Swing Votes I: Indiana Supreme Court, \" 53 Indiana Law Review 95 (2020); and \"Illustrating Swing Votes II: United States Su-preme Court, \" 53 Indiana Law Review 135 (2020). John Hill published the book, The Prophet of Modern Constitutional Liberalism: John Stuart Mill and the Supreme Court, with Cambridge University Press in June 2020. The book argues that many of the con- stitutional rights doctrines of the last half-century or so\u2014the right to privacy, broad protections for freedom of speech and gender equal-ity\u2014were ideas developed by John Stuart Mill (1806-73). More than anyone else, he deserves the title \"the father of modern liberalism. \" Stephanie Hoffer was appointed Visiting Professor at the Vienna Uni-versity of Economics & Business.

He authored numerous articles and book chapters, and drafted federal and state laws. Professor Hoffer is a renowned scholar and teacher who will con- tinue Professor Jegen's legacy of scholarship and teaching, according to IU McKinney Dean Karen E. Bravo. \"We are delighted to have Professor Hoffer bring her passion for tax law to IU McKinney, \" Dean Bravo said. \"We are very grateful to the individuals who have made this endowed chair possible, honor - ing Professor Jegen's legendary service and contributions to our law school and the legal profession in a very important way. \" Professor Hoffer recalls meeting Professor Jegen on a visit to IU McKinney several years ago and knew of his formidable reputation among tax experts and legions of law school alumni. She was touched to learn that she was being considered for the Law - rence A. Jegen III Chair in T ax Law during the search process in 2019. \"I know how meaningful he was to the faculty and to the alumni.

They are being so honored for their work on the Pathway to the Law On-line Pipeline Curriculum. Professor Max Huffman, IU McKinney's Director of Online Learning, made the announcement in May. This four-course sequence takes undergraduate students through courses in Introduction to Law, Introduction to Legal Writing, Logic and Legal Reasoning, and Advanced Legal Rea- soning. Students also become acquainted with essential skills to earn admission to and succeed in law school. Additionally, they are integrated into a larger network of law students, legal professionals, and the IU McKinney family.
