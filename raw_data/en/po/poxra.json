(Average Time: 15-30 minutes) The newest mini-training module is on promoting food security. Food insecurity is a critical child health issue that impacts millions of infants, children, youth, and families in all communities across the U.S. Children who live in households with food insecurity are likely to be sick more often, recover from illness more slowly, and be hospitalized more frequently. As pediatric health care professionals, we need to screen and identify children at risk for food insecurity; connect families to needed community resources; and advocate for policies that support access to adequate and healthy food. The new mini-training module is available on the [Bright Futures Pediatric Residency Resource Library](https://brightfutures.aap.org/clinical-practice/Pediatric-Residency-Resource-Library/Pages/Education.aspx).
