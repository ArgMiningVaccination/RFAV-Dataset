The NF-B signaling pathway plays a key role in the inflammatory process. Its activation promotes the release of pro-inflammatory mediators like iNOS an isolated from rhubarb, has been known to have anti-inflammatory effects. However, its influence on PPAR remains largely unknown. In this study, an inflammation model was constructed, by stimulating RAW264.7 cells with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Rhein was used as and GW9662 (PPAR- inhibitor) as for depth studies. The results demonstrated that rhein inhibits NF-B activation and inflammatory factor release. However, GW9662 significantly reduced this effect, indicating that PPAR- is a critical mediator in the rhein-mediated anti-inflammatory process. Additionally, positive modulation of PPAR- expression and activity, by rosiglitazone, correspondingly influenced the effects of rhein on inflammatory factors and NF-B expression. We also found that rhein could enhance PPAR, NF-B, and histone deacetylases 3 These results indicate that rhein exerts its anti-inflammation function by regulating is a multifaceted physiological process that can occur in any tissue, Page 4 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 4and is initiated by various injuries such as trauma, burns, microbes, and sepsis(Kim et al. 2018). A normal inflammatory reaction, designed to eliminate hazards in the host, has health benefits (Hotamisiligil 2017) . However, if the magnitude or duration goes awry, it may increase pathological lesion numbers in the host (Hu et al. 2014). Numerous diseases, including cancers (Christian et al. 2016) and sepsis (Su et al. 2017), are reportedly closely associated with inflammation. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) is an ubiquitous transcription factor in cells, regulatig various genes when activated (Kaltschmidt et al. 2005). During the inflammatory process, the NF-B transcription factor signaling pathway is activated in immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages (Christian et al. 2016). Subsequently, pro-inflammatory factors, including tumor factor- (TNF-) synthase (iNOS) (Zeviali et al. 2017), are expressed, which bind to their cell membrane receptors, amplifying the activation of the NF-B signaling pathway (Yu et al. 2017). These processes may lead to severe inflammation cascade amplification (Mira et al. 2017). Thus, inhibiting NF-B activation holds intriguing possibilities for inflammation-attenuating therapy. The nuclear receptor superfamily receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR-), reportedly negatively regulates et al. 2017; He et al. 2017). PPAR- activation could suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by NF-B et al, could down-regulate TNF- (Bermudez et al. 2017) and iNOS(Wang et al. 2018) expressions in macrophage. Currently, natural products like -caryophyllin, have also been shown to activate PPAR- (Zlotos et al. 2006). These Page 5 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 5may provide a new tangent to further study natural medicines, which can attenuate inflammation. Rhein (4,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid), the main rhubarb component, has reportedly been widely utilized for inflammation treatment in China (Zhao et al. 2018). Reports indicate that rhein could suppress inflammation by inhibiting NF-B activation and down-regulating its downstream cytokines, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages (Ma et al. 2018). However, the molecular mechanism of NF-B inhibition by rhein remains unclear. Given the effect of PPAR- on NF-B, we hypothesized that rhein attenuates inflammation by activating PPAR-, and subsequently suppresses the expression of NF-B and its downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, an inflammatory cell model was constructed using LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. These were then treated with rhein, rosiglitazone, or GW9662 alone or combined with LPS. The anti-inflammation property of rhein was reconfirmed and part of the mechanism uncovered. This study demonstrated the functional capacity of rhein in improving inflammation through inflammasomes regulation, via the PPAR--NF-B-HDAC3 axis. We not only provided reliable evidence for clinical application of rhein, but also found a new approach to discovering more natural medicines with anti-inflammatory functions. Materials and Methods MaterialsPage 6 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 6LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5), rosiglitazone, and GW9662 were Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical, St. Louis, USA). Rhein (purity90 %) was provided by the China Food and Drug Administration (Beijing, China). Cell culture RAW 264.7 cells (Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Shanghai, China) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEMGibco, Grans Island, NY, USA), supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin (all Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. At 80 -90 % confluence, incubated at 37 \u00b0C, cells were pretreated with LPS (0.2 g/ml). After 0.5 h, rhein (80, 100, and 120 M), GW9662, or rosiglitazone were added with or without LPS. CCK8 assay Cell viability was assayed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate for 12 h. After treatment with increasing rhein concentrations (60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 M), with or without LPS (0.2 g/ml), for 24 h, the CCK8 solution was added and then incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a spectrophotometer (Beckman, Westbury NY, USA). Western blot analysis RAW264.7 cells were lysed, and then protein concentration was measured using Page 7 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 7the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE (12 % acrylamide), and transferred onto (Millipore, Billerica, USA). The blocked using 4 % non-fat milk, then incubated with primary antibodies (Table 1), at 4 \u00b0C, overnight. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled (Table 1) secondary IgG antibodies were added for 1 h. The blots were analyzed by measuring chemiluminescence. Protein density was measured using ImageJ analysis software. Expression levels were normalized using the reference protein -actin. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) RNA was extracted from RAW264.7 cells using the TRIzol kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), following the manufacturer's instruction. Using oligo (dT) primers (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China), the RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA (sequences shown in Table 2), and subsequently used for qPCR. PCR amplification and final extension were as follows: 95 C for 1 min, 33 cycles of 95 C for 10 sec, 60 C for 30 sec, and 72 C for 15 sec. GAPDH was used to normalize target gene expression, and the condition was 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. Amplification products obtained by PCR were run in 2% and PharmacologyDraft 8RAW264.7 cells (5\u00d7105 cells/ml) were seeded in a 96-well plate for 1 h. Then, the cells were primed with LPS (0.2 g/ml) and rhein (80, 100, and 120 M), for 24h, and 100 l of supernatant taken out. TNF- levels in the supernatant were tested using ELISA kits (Invitrogen, CA, USA), per the manufacturer's instructions. Co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) Cells were lysed, per established protocols, and the protein concentration determined, using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, USA). The proteins were incubated with anti-PPAR-/anti-NF-B p65 antibodies, at 4C overnight, then, 20 l beads added for 1h at 4C. The supernatant was discarded, following centrifugation at 2000 x g for 2 min. The beads were washed twice, using RIPA lysate, and the amount of binding PPAR-, HDAC3, NF-Bp65, and -actin measured via western blotting. Statistical analyses All results are shown as mean \u00b1 SD. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Turkey test, were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). In all cases, P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Effect of rhein on RAW264.7 cell viability In this study, the effect of various rhein concentrations (60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 M) on cell viability was evaluated in a cell injury model, which was constructed by inducing RAW264.7 cells with LPS, using the CCK8 assay. All concentrations, but Page 9 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 9140 M rhein (82.3\u00b14.9 %), showed no apparent cytotoxic nor inhibited RAW264.7 cell growth (Fig. 1A). The viability of cells exposed to LPS for 24 h was 80.0 \u00b1 1.0 % for the control, while treatment with rhein (80, 100, and 120 M) protected cells from LPS-induced injury, restoring cell survival to 96.0 \u00b1 \u00b1 1B). Based on the CCK8 results, rhein concentrations used were 80, 100, and 120 M. Rhein decreased iNOS and TNF- expression in RAW264.7 cells. The inflammatory mediators TNF- and iNOS, play important roles in inflammasomes (Zeviali et al. 2017). To investigate the anti-inflammatory rhein in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, iNOS and TNF- expressions were measured. The results showed that rhein alone does not induce iNOS and TNF- expressions, compared with the control (Fig. 2A). LPS significantly increased iNOS and TNF- expressions, compared with the control (P<0.05, Fig. 2B). Rhein markedly reduced cytokines levels, dose-dependently (Fig. 2). Rhein inhibits LPS-primed NF-B expression Studies have shown that NF-B regulates inflammatory mediator expression (Nishida et al. 2011). To evaluate the probable anti-inflammatory mechanism of rhein, LPS- activated NF-B levels were measured. The results showed that LPS sharply increased NF-B p65 mRNA and expression, dose-dependently (Fig. that rhein decreased LPS-induced NF-B p65 protein (Figs. 3B and C).Page 10 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 10 Rhein promotes PPAR- expression It was previously reported that some herbal products exert anti-inflammatory effects by activating PPAR- (He et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2015). In this study, we investigated the effects of rhein on PPAR- activation. Results from qRT-PCR and western blotting showed that LPS decreased PPAR- protein and mRNA expressions (Fig. 4). Rhein treatment increased PPAR- levels, compared to model cells (LPS treated cells) (Figs. 4 A, B, and C, P<0.05 vs. the model group) androsiglitazone-treated cells. Moreover, rhein alone has no influence on PPAR- expression. Rosiglitazone enhances the anti-inflammation effects of rhein To examine the role of PPAR- in rhein-mediated inhibition of LPS-induced inflammation, we examined the effects of rhein in RAW 264.7 cells treated with the PPAR- agonist rosiglitazone (10 M). The LPS-treated cells had higher NF-B, TNF-, and iNOS expressions, than the control (Fig. 5). Comparatively, rhein decreased NF-B and inflammation cytokine expression and release, like rosiglitazone. These results collectively indicate that the protective effects of rhein in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells may be PPAR--mediated. rhein and rosiglitazone GW9662, a PPAR- inhibitor (Wang et al. 2011), was used to further investigate Page 11 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 11the potential anti-inflammatory molecular mechanism of rhein. Quantitative western blot data showed that LPS treatment effectively increased NF-B, TNF, and iNOS expressions (Figs. 6 A-D). The ELISA assay revealed an observable increase in TNF- production with GW9662 treatment (Fig. 6E). Additionally, the anti-inflammatory effects of rhein and rosiglitazone were substantially reduced in GW9662-treated RAW264.7 cells. Rhein promotes PPAR-NF-B-HDAC3 interaction As previously suggested, PPAR- interacts with HDAC3(a transcription co-activator) (Chen et al. 2011), to activate NF-B transcription. We further investigated whether rhein promotes PPAR- and HDAC3 cooperation to in regulating NF-kB expression and an inflammatory response, in LPS-primed RAW264.7 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to examine the effect of rhein on the interaction between PPAR-, HDAC3, and NF-B. RAW264.7 cell lysates were mixed with an anti-PPAR- antibody, and the resulting immune complexes analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-NF-B and anti-HDAC3 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of lysates resulted in NF-B and HDAC3 co-precipitation (Figs. 7 A and C). We also detected this interaction reciprocally using an anti-NF-B antibody for immunoprecipitation, and anti-PPAR and anti-HDAC3 antibodies for immunoblotting of the precipitate (Figs. 7 B and D). Control mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) did not precipitate any proteins. The PPAR-NF-B-HDAC3 complex dissociated dramatically in the presence of LPS, as Page 12 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 12judged by co-immunoprecipitations with anti-PPAR- (Figs. 7 A and C) and anti-NF-B (Figs. 7 B and D) antibodies. Rhein up-regulated the PPAR--NF-B-HDAC3 interaction in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, which was similar to rosiglitazone or rosiglitazone plus rhein (Figs. 7 A and B); however, GW9662 reversed the effect of rosiglitazone (Figs. 7 C and D). Consistent with these results, we proposed that rhein might increase the PPAR--NF-B-HDAC3 interaction via PPAR-, to regulate NF-kB activation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Discussion Rhein reportedly has anti-inflammatory and anti-sepsis properties (Yu et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017). This study was performed to confirm its anti-inflammation property and uncover its mechanism of action. The major finding was that rhein attenuates the LPS-induced inflammatory response by activating PPAR- to inhibit the NF-B pathway. Inflammation is a key pathogenic event in sepsis; therefore, it is necessary to investigate effective anti-inflammatory strategies to limit inflammatory effector release in this disease. Macrophages play important roles in the inflammatory response, via chemokine and cytokine release control, which could directly amplify inflammation. LPS-stimulated macrophages could activate and modulate intracellular signaling cascades via multiple pathways (Dobrovolskaia and Vogel 2002). The NF-B cascade is one of the most extensively investigated intracellular signaling Page 13 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 13pathway involved in the LPS-induced inflammatory response (He et al. 2017). The anti-inflammatory properties of rhein inhibit NF-B signaling and its downstream inflammatory factors (Zhang et al. 2015). As expected, rhein effectively suppressed NF-B signaling and downregulated iNOS and TNF- levels in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, which indicate its protective effects, partly attributed to inflammatory mediator suppression. The anti-inflammatory potential of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family receptor PPAR-, has been recently reinforced. These nuclear receptors have long been implicated in inflammatory response control (Silva and Goncalves-de-Albuquerque 2019); specific PPAR- activators (e.g., thiazolidinediones) have been found active in experimental inflammation models, and recently in clinical investigation (Hong et al. 2018). Recent studies have shown that rhein behaves as a PPAR- activator, in reducing fat and weight, and preventing diet-induced obesity, in mice (Zhang et al. 2017). We investigated the effect of rhein on PPAR- in the LPS-induced RAW264.7 cell model, which reconfirmed its positive effect on PPAR-. The results also showed that rosiglitazone (PPAR- agonist) has the same anti-inflammation function as rhein. Nevertheless, this function is reversed by GW9662 (PPAR- antagonist), indicating PPAR- is vital in this anti-inflammatory process. In this study, we provide evidence that rhein dampens the inflammatory response via PPAR- signaling. However, the mechanism underpinning PPAR- signal Page 14 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 14activation by rhein remains unclear. PPAR- binds in a sequence-specific manner: an import function of PPAR- is negative inflammatory gene expression regulation, in a signal-specific manner, through a mechanism termed \"transrepression\" (Glass and Saijo 2010). NF-Bs are key inflammatory transcription factors, and their binding sites have been described in many immediate inflammatory response genes. On inactive promoters, factors such as NF-B bind to N-CoR and HDAC3 co-repressor complexes, maintaining basal repression. During transrepression, activated PPAR- binds and prevents complex clearance from inflammatory gene promoters (Hong and Tontonoz 2008). Core histone acetylation allows transcription factors to bind to their target promoters. Acetylated histone turnover is regulated by the opposing actions of histone acetyltrasferases (HATs) and HDACs, with HATs generally allowing transcription, and HDACs repressing it. Several studies have proven that HDAC3 plays a critical role in promoting the inflammatory response through NF-B acetylation (McClure et al. 2017; Hua et al. 2016). In the present study, we further examined the effect of rhein on PPAR- and HDAC3, and their interaction with NF-B p65. The results indicated that rhein increased interaction with NF-B p65, RAW264.7 cells. Thus, propose alleviates inflammation by promoting NF-B, PPAR- and HDAC3 complex formation, and subsequently preventing NF-B acetylation and inhibiting downstream pro-inflammation cytokines. LPS-induced inflammation or sepsis prevention is a pertinent concern, requiring further studies. The present study was conducted on this basis, and revealed a novel, Page 15 of 32 https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjpp-pubsCanadian Journal of Physiology and PharmacologyDraft 15long signaling pathway mediating rhein effects, involving PPAR-, NF-B, and HDAC3. Collectively, the results may have therapeutic implications, suggesting that rhein may be a good LPS-induced inflammation blocking candidate.
