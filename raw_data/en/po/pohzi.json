Our specialists offer a full range of supportive services tailored to you to make the treatment process as comfortable and accommodating as possible. Sexual Rehabilitation After Surgery Despite the best efforts of surgeons and radiation oncologists, many men experience some decrease in erectile function after prostate cancer surgery. The extent and duration of erectile dysfunction depends on many factors, such as age, the level of function before treatment, and whether the nerves controlling erectile function were affected. Our goal is to help you minimize the extent and duration of any post-treatment dysfunction. Our specialists conducted the first study showing that daily administration of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, a group of medications that include sildenafil (Viagra\u00ae) and tadalafil (Cialis\u00ae), can help restore erectile function. Our researchers were the first to show that phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as Viagra\u00ae and Cialis\u00ae, can help restore erectile function. Your doctor can recommend medication and assistive devices, such as an erection device or penile prosthesis, that can help you resume sexual activity within six weeks of prostate cancer surgery. Our sexual rehabilitation specialist works with you and your partner to develop the best plan for you. Urinary Incontinence Temporary light [urinary incontinence](/conditions/male-urinary-dysfunction) after prostate cancer surgery is normal. In most cases, continence returns within a few weeks. Our experts may recommend pelvic floor strengthening exercises to speed recovery.
