So convenient and made with great ingredients I won't eat any other frozen burritos!!! I'm a Red's only girl!!Majeeplady Buy it already! My absolute favorite breakfast in the whole world. Helps keep me fueled for a 16 hour shift. Great way to start off my day. Only reason I took morning shifts was to eat the burritos. I buy a weeks supply at a time so I don't run out.
