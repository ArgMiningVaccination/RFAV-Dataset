CAM includes all such practices and ideas defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being. Cochrane Collaboration COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINAL SYSTEMS CAM can be broadly divided into seven major categories mind-body medicine, alternative medical systems, lifestyle and disease prevention, biologically-based therapies, manipulative and body-based systems, biofield, and Bioelectromagnetics. SIDDHA SYSYTEM OF MEDICINE Siddha is one of the ancient traditional medicinal systems like ayurveda, which is practiced in South India and a part of trio Indian medicines - ayurveda, siddha and unani. This system of medicine was popular in ancient India, Due to the antiquity of this medical system, the siddha system of medicine is believed to be one of the oldest medical system. The system is believed to be developed by the 18 siddhas in the south called siddhar. They are the ancient supernatural spiritual saints of India and the Siddha system is believed to be handed over to the Siddhar by the Hindu God. DEFINITION The term Siddha literally means one who has attained perfection in life or the heavenly bliss which is a boon for chronic ailments like asthma, ulcer, arthritis, diabetes, aids, infertility etc., for which allopath does not have permanent cure . Siddha also have preventive measures and doesn't yield any side effect. MEANING Siddhars were of the concept that a healthy soul can only be developed through a healthy body. So they developed methods and medication that are believed to strengthen their physical body and thereby their souls. Men and women who dedicated their lives into developing the system were called Siddhars. They practiced intense yogic practices, including years of fasting and meditation. And believed to have achieved super natural powers and gained the supreme wisdom and overall immortality. Through this spiritually attained supreme knowledge, they wrote scriptures on all aspects of life, from arts to science and truth of life to miracle cure for diseases. BASIC CONCEPT The siddha medicine recognizes predominance of vatham, pitham and kapam in childhood, adulthood and old age respectively, whereas in ayurveda it is totally reversed: kapam is dominant in childhood, vatham in old age and pitham in adults. According to the Siddha medicine various psychological and physiological functions of the body are attributed to the combination of seven elements: First is saram (plasma) responsible for growth, development and nourishment; Second is cheneer (blood) responsible for nourishing muscles, imparting colour and improving intellect; Third is ooun (muscle) responsible for shape of the body; Fourth is kollzuppu (fatty tissue) responsible for oil balance and lubricating joints; Fifth is elumbu (bone) responsible for body structure and posture and movement; Sixth is moolai (brain) responsible for strength; Seventh is sukila (semen) responsible for reproduction. Like in Ayurveda, in Siddha medicine also the physiological components of the human beings are classified as vatha (air), pitha (fire) and kapha (earth and water). CONCEPT OF DISEASE AND CAUSE It is assumed that when the normal equilibrium of three humors (vatha, pitha and kapha) is disturbed, disease is caused. The factors, which assumed to affect this equilibrium are environment, climatic conditions, diet, physical activities, and stress. Diagnosis In diagnosis, examination of eight items is required which is commonly known as \"enn vakaith thervu\". These are: Na (tongue): black in white kapha, ulcerated in anaemia. Varna (colour): dark pale in kapha; Svara (voice): normal in vatha, high pitched in pitha, low pitched in kapha, slurred in alcoholism. Kan (eyes): muddy conjunctiva, pitha, pale Sparisam dry in vatha, warm in pitha, chill in kapha, sweating in different parts of the body. Mala (stool): black stools indicate vatha, yellow pitha, pale in kapha, dark red in ulcer and shiny in terminal illness. Neer (urine): early morning urine is examined; straw colour indicates indigestion, reddish yellow excessive heat, rose in blood pressure, saffron colour in jaundice and looks like meat washed water in renal disease. Nadi (pulse): the confirmatory method recorded on the radial art. Drugs used by Siddha The drugs used by the Siddhars could be classified into three groups: Thavara (herbal product), Dhathu (inorganic substances) Jangamam (animal products). The drugs used in siddha medicine were classified on the basis of five properties: suvai (taste), guna (character), veerya (potency), pirivu (class) and mahimai (action). According to their mode of application the Siddha medicine could be categorized into two classes: a) Internal medicine b) External medicine ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR AND ITS REMEDIES IN THE VIEW OF SIDDHA MEDICINE The abnormal behaviors described in the name of Kirukai Vaithyam. According to Kirusa Nithanam 50 the symptoms for the psychological disorders as follows: standing with upper limbs, restlessness, singing meaninglessly, dancing, laughing, changing postures, sleeplessness, embracing others, loose talking, murmuring, spitting on others, wandering, sexual aggression, rolling on the floors, standing naked, removal of clothes. Classification of abnormal behaviors: Saint Agasthiyar describes about 18 disorders in the Siddhars believed that the root cause of the abnormal behaviors are Evil desire, disordered thoughts, passions, morbid imaginations, excessive fear, envy, anger, and immoral activities. 'The Karma' or off-shoots or chronic disease are mainly caused by the Man's previous actions. The Law of Karma' describes that Sin actions of man are the root cause of the present life. Present life is guided by our karma. Siddhars believed that the mental abnormalities are caused by the evil karmas of the man or his/her ancestor's karma. If the Pitham increased, the mental abnormalities occurred. Siddhars also believed that the abnormalities may occurred due to sleeplessness and breaking of Varma points, traumatic disorders may occur. Remedies recommended by the siddhars for abnormalities Siddhars prescribed Aviztham (Medicines) as well as Manthiram (Psychotherapy). Some of the medicines are Thuvalai - Anointing-external application: Through leaves and flowers Vedhu (Steam bath): Through leaves and flowers Ullukku koduthal (Oral route): Through leaves and Cloves Nasium - application): Through and garlic , Pepper, Flower , Garlic, Turmeric Another method-Through Ginger juice, honey, milk, sugarcane juice or heat water. Psychotherapy ( Manthiram)- Giving spiritual healing is enhancing the speed of recovery. Using manthiram (Spritual words) may cure the diseases, particularly for Karma diseases. ROLE OF NURSES Need to understand all aspects of CAM, including costs, patient knowledge, and drug interactions, to promote holistic strategies for patients to achieve a higher quality of life. Integral role in the coordination and facilitation of such therapies. Use, holistic nursing therapies that can be described as complementary or alternative in nature. Should obtain and maintain appropriate education and clinical experience in order to maintain competency in CAT. Familiar with Nurse Practice Act and perform only those therapies inherent in the RN's scope of practice. RNs have an ethical and professional responsibility to support an individual's choice regarding health care and educate the patient about various therapeutic options and the risk and benefits associated with each. INFLUENCE OF NUTRIENTS IN MENTAL HEALTH Energy intake and mental health The human brain is metabolically very active and uses about 20 to 30% of a person's energy intake at rest. Individuals who do not eat adequate calories from food to meet their energy requirements will experience changes in mental functioning. Simply skipping breakfast is associated with lower fluency and problem-solving ability, especially in individuals who are already slightly malnourished. A hungry person may also experience lack of energy or motivation. Chronic hunger and energy deprivation profoundly affects mood and responsiveness. People with a consistently low energy intake often feel apathetic, sad, or hopeless. Developing fetuses and young infants are particularly susceptible to brain damage from malnutrition. Malnutrition early in life has been associated with below- normal intelligence, and functional and cognitive defects. Carbohydrates and mental health Carbohydrates significantly affect mood and behavior. Eating a meal high in carbohydrates triggers release of a hormone called insulin in the body. Insulin helps let blood sugar into cells where it can be used for energy, but insulin also has other effects in the body. As insulin levels rise, more tryptophan enters the brain. Tryptophan is an amino acid, or a building block of protein, that affects levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. As more tryptophan enters the brain, more of the neurotransmitter serotonin is produced. Higher serotonin levels in the brain enhance mood and have a sedating effect, promoting sleepiness. This effect is partly responsible for the drowsiness some people experience after a large meal. Proteins and mental health Protein intake and intake of individual amino acids can affect brain functioning and mental health. Many of the neurotransmitters (tryptophan , serotonin) in the brain are made from amino acids. If the needed amino acid is not available, levels of that particular neurotransmitter in the brain will fall, and brain functioning and mood will be affected. For example, if there is a lack of tryptophan in the body, not enough serotonin will be produced, and low brain levels of serotonin are associated with low mood and even aggression in some individuals. Likewise, some diseases can cause a buildup of certain amino acids in the blood, leading to brain damage and mental defects. For example, a buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine in individuals with a disease called pheylketonuria can cause brain damage and mental retardation . Fats and mental health Some studies suggest that reducing fat and cholesterol in the diet may deplete brain serotonin levels, causing mood changes, anger, and aggressive behavior. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils, & promotes brain functioning. Although a few studies suggest omega-3 fatty acids are helpful with bipolar affective disorder and stress . High levels of fat and cholesterol in the diet contribute to atherosclerosis, or clogging of the arteries. Atherosclerosis can decrease blood flow to the brain, impairing brain functioning. If blood flow to the brain is blocked, a stroke occurs. Vitamins and mental health Alcoholism is often associated with thiamin deficiency. Alcohol interferes with thiamin metabolism in the body, and diets high in alcohol are often deficient in vitamins and minerals. Individuals with a thiamin deficiency can develop Wernicke- Korsakoff syndrome , which is characterized by confusion, mental changes, abnormal eye movements, and unsteadiness that can progress to severe memory loss. Vitamin B-12 Vitamin B-12 is needed to maintain the outer coating, called the myelin sheath, on nerve cells. Inadequate myelin results in nerve damage and impaired brain function. Vitamin B-12 deficiency can go undetected in individuals for years, but it eventually causes low blood iron, irreversible nerve damage, dementia , and brain atrophy. Folic acid Even modest folic acid deficiency in women causes an increased risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, in developing fetuses. Folic acid deficiency also increases risk of stroke and its deficiency leads to a range of mental disorders, including depression. Niacin Niacin is involved in releasing energy in the body from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. A deficiency of niacin produces many mental symptoms such as irritability, headaches, loss of memory, inability to sleep, and emotional instability. Vitamin B-6 Vitamin B-6 deficiency is characterized by mental changes such as fatigue , nervousness, irritability, depression, insomnia , dizziness, and nerve changes. Doses of 500 mg per day or more can cause nerve damage, dizziness, sensory loss, and numbness. Vitamin E Vitamin E deficiency causes changes in red blood cells and nerve tissues. It progresses to dizziness, vision changes, muscle weakness, and sensory changes. Because it is an antioxidant, vitamin E has also been studied for treatment of neurological conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease . Vitamin A Headache and increased pressure in the head is associated with both deficient and excess vitamin A intake. Among other effects, excess vitamin A intake can cause fatigue, irritability, and loss of appetite. Minerals and mental health Iron Iron deficiency eventually leads to anemia, with insufficient oxygen reaching the brain. The anemia can cause fatigue and impair mental functioning. Iron deficiency during the first two years of life can lead to permanent brain damage. Magnesium Magnesium aids in the transmission of nerve impulses. Magnesium deficiency can cause restlessness, nervousness, muscular twitching, and unsteadiness. Acute magnesium deficiency can progress to apathy , delirium, convulsions, coma, and death. Manganese Manganese is involved in carbohydrate metabolism and brain functioning and manganese deficiency can cause abnormalities in brain function. Miners of manganese in South America have developed manganese toxicity called manganese madness, with neurological symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. Copper Iron metabolism in the body and in brain function. Deficiency of copper causes anemia, with inadequate oxygen delivery to the brain and other organs. Copper deficiency also impairs brain functioning and immune system response, including changes in certain chemical receptors in the brain and lowered levels of neurotransmitters. Zinc Zinc is involved in maintaining cell membranes and protecting cells from damage. Zinc deficiency can cause neurological impairment, influencing appetite, taste, smell, and vision and is associated with apathy, irritability, jitteriness, and fatigue. Selenium Synthesis of some hormones and helps protect cell membranes from damage. Selenium toxicity causes nervous system changes, fatigue, and irritability. Depression Studies have suggested that vitamin and mineral deficiencies are linked to depression. Alcohol and sugar both cause emotional issues and depression in certain individuals, especially those with low blood sugar. Daily exercise and nutrition is also recommended for depression and mood swings. Anxiety and Panic Disorders Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) plays a big role in anxiety and panic disorders. Symptoms of a panic attack are erratic fast paced breathing, accelerated heart rate, a choking feeling and numbness in the hands and feet. Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Numerous factual studies have stated that ADHD individuals lack essential vitamins and minerals in their diet, such as magnesium and zinc. Mood Disorders: Some people experience mood disorders like depression and anxiety because their brains do not produce adequate amounts of beta-carotene and serotonin hormone. ROLE OF NURSES In promoting a healthy diet in a client with learning disabilities to the provision of parenteral nutrition to a critically ill patient. Helps in preparation and serving of food. Mental health nurses should keep up-to- date with recent literature on nutrition and physical and mental health. Nurses working with Multidisciplinary team should be used to support health promotion and the introduction of nutrition in the rehabilitation of mental health problems. Nurses should develop policies and guidelines to encourage health care professionals to adopt nutrition and health promotion in their practice.
