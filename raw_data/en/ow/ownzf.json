In the majority of cases, the risk for complications and long term issues from contracting the Covid-19 virus significantly outweigh the risks associated with vaccination. For most patients we are recommending vaccination. We are not recommending vaccination if you have a history of an anaphylactic reaction to any of the ingredients in the vaccine; if you have a history of an allergic reaction to the covid 19 vaccine; if you have had a severe allergic reaction to any previous vaccination; or you have a history of vaccine injury. Do not get vaccinated if you have a history of hives or anaphylaxis from exposure to polysorbate or polyethylene glycol (PEG). To review in depth the pre vaccination check list, go to the CDC's web site at: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/pre-vaccination-screening-form.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/pre-vaccination-screening-form.pdf) If you would like to review your specific medical issues in relation to vaccination and receive recommendation for immune, allergic, or liver support during the vaccination process, please call reception and book an appointment with one of our practitioners.
