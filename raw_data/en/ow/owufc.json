Did you know that there's plenty you can do to prevent a hangover by helping your liver to process alcohol? As a part of The Morrison Center family, it's our duty to keep you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed the morning after so you can celebrate and wake up feeling fresh! In the video below, Dr. Morrison and our two nutritionists at The Morrison Center, Stephanie Mandel, and Robin Foroutan explain why we get hangovers, their personal favorite hangover hacks and the natural supplements they use to help prevent hangovers before they begin. - WHY HANGOVERS HAPPEN - When alcohol is detoxified by the liver, a chemical called [acetaldehyde](https://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/drugs-alcohol/hangover4.htm) is produced, which drains the body of important antioxidants, thus creating oxidative stress and inflammation. This intermediary of alcohol metabolism is actually [more toxic than alcohol itself](https://www.foundationalmedicinereview.com/blog/acetaldehyde-and-hangovers-understanding-the-role-of-phenolic-compounds-in-treatment/) and contributes to hangover symptoms. [Congeners](https://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/drugs-alcohol/hangover3.htm) are byproducts of fermentation in darker, less distilled drinks like whiskey and bourbon. Research shows that beverages with the high levels of congeners [cause worse hangovers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20712591). Clear liquors, on the other hand, have fewer congeners, which may be why many people feel less of a hangover the next day when they choose a high quality, distilled vodka or gin instead (without other sugary ingredients of course). Alcohol causes inflammation via the production of prostaglandins, a group of pro-inflammatory compounds with hormone-like effects on the body. These effects range from regulating blood vessel tone, water and electrolyte balance, and other metabolic actions that may trigger unpleasant symptoms. This is why most people reach for painkillers like Tylenol or Advil when they are trying to treat their hangover. But there's a better way... - HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO - | | ANTIOXIDANTS Before you start drinking, make sure to load up on antioxidants.
