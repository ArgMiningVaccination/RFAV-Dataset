The World Health Organisation has declared it a non-toxic system of medicine and the second most widely used system of medicine internationally. The model of Homeopathy is one of individualisation. It helps to stimulate the immune system and body's natural ability to heal. The potentised remedy acts as a catalyst to set healing in motion. This is known as self-healing through body's own DNA repair mechanism. An important principle of homeopathic medicine is that the treatment for every individual is different depending on each person's specific symptoms, his history, his body etc. Even if two patients have the same illness, the Homeopathic doctor will prescribe different medicines based on their symptoms and history. Dr Jayshree Thakur of Dr Jayshree's Homeopathic Healthcare Clinic said, \"The superiority of homeopathy from the conventional medicine is in a fact that the relief offered by it in the treatment of chronic diseases is quite lasting for many months or years. This is achieved because homeopathy treats the root of the diseases. The approach in homeopathy is such that it addresses the patient's physical, disease, emotional and genetic totality; and treats the disease traits. Homeopathy is essentially a safe system of medicine, free from any adverse effects if used correctly.\" Dr Thakur added that the format of the medicine is such that the medicines are without any toxic substance. The medicines are prepared from natural substance obtained from plant, animal and mineral kingdom, hence are absolutely harmless. It was found in a recent study conducted by IMRB on \"Acceptance of Homeopathy in India\" that 59 per cent people in major cities have shifted from allopathy to homeopathy in the last one year. An assessment on 'Homoeopathy demand on the rise' by The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) found that people in metro cities in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Hyderabad etc. spoke very high for homeopathy. They believe that though homeopathy takes time to root out aliments but it is safe and physiologically satisfactory because of no side effects. Other sources of medicine like Herbal, Ayurveda are also on the rise. Herbal: This system of medicine is considered as an effective method of healing in the Indian history. Many drugs have been obtained from the plant sources like aspirin from willow bark.The Herbal medicines gained boost when WHO motivated developing countries to use the traditional plant medicines to fulfill the needs not met by allopathy. Dr Maria Carina Cordeiro of the Goan Pharma said, \"As per the WHO reports, about three-quarters of the world's population currently use herbs and other forms of traditional medicines to treat diseases. Allopathic medicines have failed to prove its efficiency and there are number of diseases with no therapeutic solutions. Ayurveda: A 5000 year old science treating ailments at their roots and offering holistic cure in a natural way. It is a \"Science of Life\" that guides an individual to live a healthy long life. Established in 1899, Sandu is a well-known brand in the field of Ayurveda and is a leading Ayurvedic manufacturing and marketing company selling Ayurvedic products for over 119 years. Umesh Sandu, Director of Sandu Pharmaceuticals Ltd said, \"Sandu Pharmaceuticals Ltd is the only fully integrated Ayurvedic medicine manufacturing company in Goa, having a range of about 175 products which are useful for an infant to an adult. It is a myth propagated by the Western multinational drug companies that Ayurveda Medicines contain heavy metals and are unsafe for consumption. Apart from plant source, minerals and metals are also used in some medicines but they are processed and purified in such a way so that their bioavailability is increased to the highest levels, without causing any adverse effects. It is a nanomedicine technology, which was prevalent thousands of years ago, which now has been validated in recent scientific studies and accepted world over.\" Source: Alternate Medicines Earning Popularity Homeopathy: A system of alternative medicine developed over 200 years ago by a German Homeopath, Samuel Hahnemann based on the doctrine \"like cures like\".
