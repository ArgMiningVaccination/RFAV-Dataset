[No Farmers No Food](https://stop30x30summit.com/) Why I Adore Garlic Garlic is good medicine. Garlics potential benefits include: Cardiac Health Antimicrobial Anticancer There are dozens of books on garlic. Garlic grows on every continent and has been used for 6,000 years. No other food has so much folklore around it. Garlic is a culinary staple with impressive medicinal qualities. If you want to grow this herb most varieties of seed garlic are shipped in October November and December. The lovely and gracious Cynthia Rose has perfected a marina using fire roasted tomatoes fresh basil and plenty of fresh organic garlic. Mashed Garlic Red Potatoes is another favorite around here. Garlic Ice Cream will surprise you. You will need an Ice Cream Freezer for this one. Perhaps by now you are thinking garlic can be added to everything. Well almost. The phytochemicals responsible for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's cells are damaged. When a cell is broken by chopping, chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cells trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids. Those compounds are responsible for the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic. You must have a garlic press. Trim the top and bottom of a clove of garlic to peel it, then pop it into the press and push hard. Out comes your garlic ready to be added to any dish you like. Today's market price of garlic is running between $9 to $18 per pound... makes it worth growing your own. My favorite variety is Transylvanian Garlic. It produces large bulbs with lots of heat and a sharp flavor that's sure to spice up recipes. Discovered in Romania in the 1990s, this early-season, artichoke-type, softneck garlic has creamy white skins with a trace of purple. Closing comment... Why Would You Eat Raw Garlic? Well, the quick answer is that it's a potent anti-infection anti-viral remedy. One teaspoon of chopped raw garlic a day will change your life. So the best way to eat it is: Take 1 tsp of raw garlic. Chopped into small pieces and leave them exposed for 2 to 4 minutes. Doing this will activate the allicin. Swallow these chopped pieces with water. If you want to chew it, that's even better. You can opt to do this first thing in the morning, or if you want to chew raw garlic, that's even better. Do it before you go to sleep because garlic breath at bedtime will not bother you as much. It is antimicrobial. It can kill the harmful bacteria in your mouth. Medicine Is Not Health Care. Food Is Health Care. Medicine Is Sick Care.
