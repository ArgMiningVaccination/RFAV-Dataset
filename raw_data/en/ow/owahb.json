The creator of Divine Locks Complex is Kayla Rochin, a well-known cosmetologist, and hairstylist whose enthusiasm for creating a hair regrowth supplement led to the creation and manufacture of this supplement. She introduced Divine Locks to the market with the help of 'Inner Beauty and You', a highly reliable cosmetic brand that has been producing a variety of cosmetics and nutritional supplements for the past six years. Together, they had arranged for extensive research and clinical trials to be done on the ingredients of Divine Locks Complex before they started marketing it. Like the other products of 'Inner Beauty and You,' Divine Locks Complex is also very much in demand. How does the Divine Locks Complex Hair Supplement for Women work? Divine Locks Complex is an amalgam of extremely powerful natural ingredients designed to stimulate hair growth in women by addressing the root cause of hair damage. The papillae in the hair follicles play a crucial role in stimulating hair growth by transferring the necessary nutrients to hair cells from the bloodstream. Loss of hair is connected with the increased presence of the enzyme dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the scalp because DHT pinches dermal papillae and prevents the easy flow of nutrients. Divine Locks Complex provides the necessary nutrients to the papillae so that they are returned to their original posture and facilitate blood circulation in the scalp. Divine Locks Complex also helps in promoting thyroid activity which can reduce the breaking down of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties so that it keeps the hair free of dandruff and removes the frizziness of the hair. It promotes the growth of new hair cells by helping to produce keratin and other proteins. The components of Divine Locks Complex can thicken the hair by keeping the hair strands moisturized, rid the body of dead cells, and augment the count of follicles from which the hair sprouts.

Divine Locks Complex is an amalgamation of 28 powerful herbs. The more important of these are explained below: Polygonum multiflorum: Commonly known by the name Chinese Knotweed, this has always been known for its ability to delay the onset of gray hair, maintain the hair healthy, and promote the general vitality of the user. It is used in Divine Locks Complex because it opens the dermal papillae to facilitate the supply of nutrition to the hair cells. Saw palmetto: This tree, with fan-shaped leaves, has long found use in nutritional supplements. Its ability to increase hair growth has been proven through many clinical trials. Besides making hair strands thick, it helps to remove dirt and grease from the hair. Spirulina: This blue-green algae has been used in conventional medicine to treat many health problems. This too helps in the thicker growth of hair and gives the hair its necessary sheen. Extracts of horsetail and bamboo: Both these are rich sources of silica, which can stimulate hair regrowth to a significant extent and prevent the breaking of the hair. Urtica diocia: Also known by the common name nettle, this herb is also helpful for solving the problem of pinched hair papillae by replacing them with healthy ones, thereby opening up the pathway to take nutrition to the hair cells. Glycine max: This is a species of legume and has antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties. It aids hair regrowth by promoting the increased formation of the hair niche known as dermal papillae. Biotin: The human body needs biotin for many of its routine jobs which include hair growth also. Many women suffer from biotin deficiency and resultant insufficient hair. Its presence in Divine Locks Complex helps in preventing hair fall and increases hair growth. Alfalfa: The forage crop alfalfa can fight pollutants and pathogens. It is an antioxidant, prevents cell damage, protects hair health, frees the body from toxins and chemicals, prevents premature graying, and reduces oxidative stress. Pantothenate: This is a water-soluble B vitamin and an essential nutrient that speeds up hair growth and slows down hair loss, besides making the hair strong and thick. Peony: [Peony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peony) is anti-inflammatory in nature and prevents the likelihood of losing hair as a result of inflammation. It is included in Divine Locks Complex to prevent damage to hair follicles from inflammation.
