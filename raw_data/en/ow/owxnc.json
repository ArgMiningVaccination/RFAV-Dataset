But despite what you might be thinking, the answer to many of these questions isn't that simple. The answer is usually, \"it depends.\" It's true. The use of psychedelic 'shrooms goes back thousands of years \u2014 and it's incredibly diverse. The ancient cultures used psychedelics to get closer to God and commune with the spirit realm. Today's research has added another layer, showing that psilocybin mushrooms can help people break free from challenges like anxiety, [depression](https://3amigos.co/psilocybin-for-depression-what-the-latest-research-is-saying-in-2021/), or PTSD. In other words, there's a lot to consider. But don't worry \u2014 this guide is meant to keep things simple! How? TLDR Reasons you might want to trip on 'shrooms Mushrooms might help you see things differently, spark your creativity, open your mind to new perspectives, and even support you in breaking free from things that hold you back. Resources for your magic mushroom trip Do your own research. Look for a trustworthy source to get your mushrooms. If you're up for it, consider trying a mushroom retreat! And if you want extra safety, go to a clinic for guidance. Stay curious and make thoughtful choices! How to have a good shroom trip Eat right! Eat light. Meditate. Set your setting. Your First Shroom Trip: What to expect Lift-off lasts about 20-40 minutes. Journaling your experience and creativity are excellent ways to journey through this phase, as liftoff can be intense. The psychonaut phase (peak highness) Go with the flow! Things you can do while high on mushrooms Watch a cool movie or listen to an interesting podcast. If you're up for it, start writing whatever comes to mind. Spend time in nature - it's like a breath of fresh air for your mood. And don't forget to move your body - dancing works wonders! Keep it light and give it a go! How long your mushroom trip might last Get comfortable. Peak highness only lasts an hour or two, beginning at the 30-minute mark and usually ending around 2 hours post-ingestion. Within 5 hours, over 95 percent of your shroom's psilocin will be gone. What to do if you feel nauseous A little bit of nausea is normal. Reducing nausea the natural way: Brew up a tea, or take ginger root in capsule form. What to do if your shroom trip goes dark Don't panic! Breathe. A little help from your friends. Use Trip Stopper. How to tell if you're coming down Interconnectedness and that mystical experience on shrooms start to fade. If you're hungry, then eat. Mmm, coffee. How you may feel afterward Well-being and awe. Tripping's long term benefits No Ego = freedom! Confidence + calm. Understanding the dark side and maybe relief from addictions. Microdosing Why people microdose... Some do it for clarity, others do it to calm anxiety. The reasons for microdosing are almost endless. Reasons you might want to trip on 'shrooms - Tripping could help you change your mind. This one is more profound than it sounds. Many people feel that a single psilocybin trip can have the same effect as years of therapy. Sounds crazy, right? Not to those who've experienced it for themselves. Just one trip helped mycologist [Paul Stamets](https://fantasticfungi.com/the-mush-room/paul-stamets-joe-rogan/#:~:text=Over%20and%20over%20and%20over,the%20human%20brain%20through%20neurogenesis.) stop stuttering, and just one trip helped Terrence McKenna find his life purpose. If you need to change your mind \u2014 really change it \u2014 then 'shrooms could be just the thing for you. - Magic Mushrooms could boost your creativity. Biochemist Francis Crick was reportedly [high on LSD](https://maps.org/research/psilo-lsd/lsd-news-timeline/2054-nobel-prize-genius-crick-was-high-on-lsd-when-he-discovered-dna#:~:text=August%208%2C%202004-,FRANCIS%20CRICK%2C%20the%20Nobel%20Prize%2Dwinning%20father%20of%20modern%20genetics,DNA%20nearly%2050%20years%20ago.) when he first envisioned the double helix structure of DNA. According to MAPS, Crick had told another biochemist \"that some Cambridge academics used LSD in tiny amounts as a thinking tool, to liberate them from preconceptions and let their genius wander freely to new ideas.\" Need to experience a creative breakthrough of your own? 'Shrooms contain enough psilocybin and psilocin to help get you there. Far more than just boosting productivity, magic mushrooms may help you realize what to spend your time being productive on. - Magic Mushrroms could help open the doors of perception. Do you need to put your life and all its problems in perspective? Then use psychedelic 'shrooms to zoom out a little bit! Once you accept the idea that this reality isn't the only one, your anxieties and problems might seem a little less daunting. \"It's a very salutary thing to realize that the rather dull universe in which most of us spend most of our time is not the only universe there is,\" Aldous Huxley once said. \"I think it's healthy that people should have this (psychedelic) experience.\" If nothing else, opening your mind's metaphorical doors is insightful and fun! - Magic Mushrooms could help you get past addictions and other self-defeating behaviours Many spiritualists believe that our egos are our biggest enemies. If that's true, then killing the ego with 'shrooms may be our biggest ally. This concept might sound a little cryptic, but research is beginning to back it up. According to the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robinseatonjefferson/2019/09/12/magic-mushrooms-as-medicine-johns-hopkins-scientists-launch-center-for-psychedelic-research-say-psychedelics-could-treat-alzheimers-depression-and-addiction/?sh=257c70adc171), \"research by us and others suggests therapeutic effects in people who suffer a range of challenging conditions including addiction (smoking, alcohol, other drugs of abuse).\" Science has just begun to grasp how anti-addictive shrooms are. Everyone's physiology and metabolism are different, and individual brain chemistry and body size play a significant role in how each individual might respond to psilocybin, as will your surroundings and emotional state, so if it is your first time or you are significantly upping your dosage, select a safe, comfortable, familiar place. Consider asking a sober trip sitter to accompany you on the coming ride. Microdose: 0 - 0.25 grams Low: 0.25 - 1 gram Medium: 1 - 2 grams Strong: 2.5 - 5 grams (for experienced users only) Heavy/Heroic: 5 grams and upwards (for experienced users only) IMPORTANT: Do not use if pregnant and do not mix with other drugs, especially alcohol. Strong or medium doses are not recommended if the following challenges are in play. Microdosing is better suited to these situations: People looking for a 'quick fix' Desperation or last resort Psychosis, Bipolar I or II or Cluster B diagnoses Resources for your mushroom trip - Do your own research. They say that knowledge is power. Guess what? It's true! We encourage you to do some digging for yourself before embarking on your next trip. \"I'm not a doctor,\" a Canadian man taking psilocybin for end-of-life treatment told [CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-man-granted-exemption-psilocybin-therapy-1.5680874) last year, \"but having read the research and a lot of the papers that researchers have put out it looks to be like it is potentially a way to allow a therapist and a patient to access some of the difficult things that you deal with.\" Of course, you don't have to face the end of your life to benefit from awareness and education. - Find a quality shroom source. And part of doing your research means finding a quality source of 'shrooms. Quality is everything, so make sure you've got your hands on [high-quality mushrooms](https://3amigos.co/shop/dried-magic-mushrooms-online-canada/) before your next trip. You definitely don't want to be wondering about the quality of your shrooms when the psilocybin kicks in! - Go on a mushroom retreat! Traditionally, psilocybin trips were a family affair. If you want to get back to the basics and take your 'shrooms in a more communal setting, consider going on a mushroom retreat. These retreats are more refined and less granola-ish than you'd expect \u2014 check out some of the offerings [here](https://retreat.guru/be/psilocybin-retreats). - Go to a certified clinic. Vancouver's [Thrive](https://thrivedowntown.com/) clinic offers psychedelic-assisted therapy. According to Thrive's clinical director, here's why: \"I have simply seen (and experienced) far too much benefit from the cautious and well-planned use of psychedelics to keep silent anymore. The psychiatric system saves lives, but also has a lot wrong with it which I see in my office on a daily basis. There is a 'coming out' around working with these medicines...\" If you're interested in psilocybin but want to stick with a more clinical setting, psilocybin-assisted therapy is probably your best bet. How to have a good Shroom trip - Eat right! The psilocybin experience tends to bring background details to the forefront of your awareness \u2014 whether these details are good or bad. In other words, you probably don't want to have pizza churning in your stomach when your 'shrooms kick in. Consider eating something lighter and healthier instead. - Eat light. But don't begin your trip with an empty stomach, either. This can cause nausea, light-headedness, and associated bad vibes. Balance is everything, which is why we recommend eating a balanced meal of healthy fats, proteins, and maybe some fiber prior to taking your 'shrooms of choice. Greek yogurt, aged cheese, or dark chocolate are all excellent choices. To make things even simpler, just grab one of our [psilocybin-infused chocolate bars](https://3amigos.co/shop/edibles/seremoni-chocolate-orange/). - Meditate. Research has linked meditation to [all sorts of goodness](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858), including reduced stress, heightened creativity, and an improved sense of wellbeing. And while meditation is always a good choice, it becomes even more important in your pre-trip period. Now is the perfect time to get your mind right \u2014 if you're angry, nervous, or judgemental, you may want to correct that before lift off. All you experienced meditators can even visualize your psilocybin experience before it begins. - Set your setting. Timothy Leary first introduced the concept of \" [set and setting](https://doubleblindmag.com/psychedelic-set-and-setting-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-important/)\" in his 1964 book, The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Simply put, \"set\" refers to your mental framework, and \"setting\" refers to your environment. Both these things should be as optimized as possible before you begin your next trip. Thankfully it's easy to set yourself up for success. How? By setting up your setting! Sorry for all the wordplay. What we mean is this: prepare any movies, music playlists, or favourite podcasts before you take 'shrooms, as these things can be tough to navigate while you're high. Arrange your room, turn on a salt lamp or two, take your dog outside, et cetera. Just get your environment as optimal as you possibly can. Your First Shroom Trip: Ready, set, lift off! What to expect - Journaling Journaling throughout the liftoff process is a great idea. Your thoughts and feelings will change as the psilocybin begins to kick in. For most people, this process only takes 20-40 minutes. However, it varies depending on factors like your experience with 'shrooms and what you ate most recently. Regardless of onset time, doing some writing or doodling is a great way to capture changes as they occur. Journaling about your trip has long-term benefits, too. Since 'shrooms impact everyone differently, recording your feelings during different parts of the process will give you some reference as to what to expect the next time. - Creativity as biofeedback? Much like you might wake up on March 1st and suddenly realize the days have gotten way longer, it's too easy to be taken by surprise at the sudden intensity of your trip. But staying creative could be a solution. Staying aware of the liftoff process is even easier for musicians and artists. Why? Because your perception of artistic expression will shift over time. Play a favourite riff on guitar, and you'll find that the notes come alive, vibrating for longer and taking on their personality. As the psilocybin continues to kick in, you may resort to playing something simpler, or stop playing entirely and find solace in silence. The psychonaut phase (peak highness) - Synesthesia: adventures in sensation Synesthesia means \"crossing of the senses.\" Think seeing sounds or hearing colours. More than a few famous musicians credit their talent to their ability to experience synesthesia while sober; for all the rest of us, taking 'shrooms might be required. This type of sensational change tends to happen gradually. First, colours begin to glow. Lights become more noticeable, and they begin to smile, almost cheerfully. Fractal patterns emerge. Sometimes these patterns are strong enough not to go away \u2014 even when you close your eyes! Eventually, space and time begin to get distorted. No worries if this type of otherworldliness doesn't sound like your cup of tea. Taking a slightly smaller dose of 1-3 grams of dried psilocybin will easily avoid this kind of trip. For a truly immersive experience, on the other hand, consider Terrence McKenna's \"heroic dose\" of ~5 grams [or more](https://www.psymposia.com/magazine/largest-dose-psilocybin-fda-study-3/). - Go with the flow As things get more intense, we have some advice: trust the mushroom. This might sound silly, but it does help. Psilocybin shrooms have been interacting with the human psyche for eons. Just let them do their thing! Many seasoned psychonauts like to take the perspective that the mushroom is their guide and are just along for the ride. Be open to the experience as it twists and turns and evolves. A good \"trip sitter\" can help if you're new to all this. They've been where you're going, which means they know what to expect enough to help you find your flow. Things you can do while on magic mushrooms - Watch a movie. Watching a movie during your trip is one of the most enjoyable things you can do. It puts your mind on autopilot and ensures you have a few hours of happy thoughts. Vibes matter, too, of course. Some of our favourite trip-friendly movies include anything by Hayao Miyazaki, no-narration documentaries like Samsara or Baraka, and nature films. If all else fails, youtube playlists of forest or beach scenes also work well (just don't forget to prepare them beforehand). - Listen to a podcast. Podcasts are books in a more modernized, far more convenient format. And this is especially evident when one is on 'shrooms \u2014 reading just might be difficult, but listening should still be easy. Besides, more podcasts than ever deal with the psychedelic realm. It'd only be fitting to listen to Mike Tyson's DMT experiences whilst tripping yourself. - Start doodling. Earlier, we suggested journaling as a good thing to do once the shrooms begin to kick in. At this point in the experience, though, regular journaling might be a little too regimented. Why journal about simple concepts when you can break out of the box and doodle? Odds are this doodling will transcend whatever language you usually write in \u2014 and that's not a bad thing. Some people feel that doing this type of automatic writing while under the influence is a great way to bring the subconscious out. - Get out in nature. Shrooms are a 100% natural product, so it makes sense that they'd be delightful in nature. And one of the best ways to experience nature? A long nature hike! As always, though, planning is everything. Your psilocybin high will likely last 4-8 hours, so plan a hike that takes about this long when done at a slow pace. Try to find a beginner-level trail that you can explore for hours without interference from other people or civilization \u2014 being compelled to talk to strangers while under the influence is not ideal. But don't go it alone, of course. Take a trusted friend or two along with you \u2014 a friend who isn't also tripping. And don't forget the buddy system. Beyond these little guidelines, however, enjoy the vibes and let your mind wander. Experiencing the beauty of nature will likely feel easier than ever before. You're in for a treat! If you're feeling extra adventurous, you can even spend your outdoor time mushroom hunting. (Just don't eat any mushrooms you find until you can analyze them sober-mindedly.) [Paul Stamets](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/what-its-like-to-trip-on-the-most-potent-magic-mushroom/561860/) would be proud. - Group therapy? Want to avoid anxiety on your next trip? Then do it with close friends. Both tradition and science validate this practice. Recent studies have found that \"high-dose, high-support\" trips are the most effective ones. Emma Young reported in the [British Psychological Society](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/19/psilocybin-from-magic-mushrooms-plus-meditation-and-spiritual-training-leads-to-lasting-changes-in-positive-traits/): \"The high-dose, the high-support group scored highest on all the scales. In some cases, such as life meaning and a rating of life \"strivings\" as being sacred or spiritual, they scored much higher. Unlike the high dose/standard support group, they also showed a big increase in trait forgiveness.\" In other words, go big or go home \u2014 as long as you're around friends that offer ample support. The closer you and your tripping buddies are, the better it is. Mushrooms can easily bring hidden fears and vulnerabilities to the surface. Be sure to stick with friends so that you can be your authentic self. Done right, psychedelics can actually bring close friends even closer. - Move your body. Ever heard the phrase, \"where the mind goes, the body follows?\" It might sound esoteric, but once you're on 'shrooms, it becomes obviously true. Fearful thoughts can all too easily turn into fearful experiences and anxiety. But this concept is also pretty easy to use for the better. Just stay in motion. Running, dancing, and just moving to music are all easy ways to boost your mood up a notch or two. If your body wants to spin around in circles (hey, kids do this all the time), don't hold back. Let it! How long your shroom trip might last - Analyzing the average mushroom trip... Depending on how much you enjoy your trip, you might be saddened to hear that the \"peak highness\" phase only lasts an hour or two, beginning at the 30-minute mark and usually ending around 2 hours post-ingestion. Don't be too sad, though \u2014 the experience often feels much longer than that. How shrooms interact with our biochemistry helps explain how this process works. Psilocybin's half-life (the amount of time it takes for the body to process half the substance out) is only 160 minutes, and psilocin's is even shorter, at 50 minutes. The way you took your shrooms matters, too. If you drank mushroom tea, the good stuff will kick in faster and leave your system sooner. Both psilocybin and psilocin are excreted through your urine. Within 5 hours, over 95 percent of your shroom's psilocin will be gone. Within 13 hours, over 95 percent of their psilocybin will be gone. By the time your shrooms have fully kicked in, their chemical essence will already be starting to dissipate. - Get comfortable. While the average psilocybin trip's length is pretty predictable, its subjective length is not. Heavy doses of psilocybin can warp your perception of time to such an extent that minutes feel like days. Moments of heavy contemplation may only last for a little while, but they can feel genuinely endless. Is time an illusion? Maybe it is, and you might be led to believe so while tripping. Just remember that even the most extended trip won't last more than 8 hours or so, according to how we usually tell time. Regardless of your location within the space-time continuum, be sure to get comfortable. If you feel like laying down \u2014 on the couch, on the floor, on some luscious grass \u2014 then do it! Staying comfortable will help you enjoy the process and experience a greater appreciation for your physical body. What to do if you feel nauseous - A little bit of nausea is normal. First thing first: it's normal to feel nausea from taking shrooms. Almost everybody feels a little nauseous during the experience, particularly at the height of the trip. Psilocybin and psilocin are foreign compounds unlike anything your body usually ingests or produces. If you're not used to it, this nausea won't be pleasant. Your body's immune system may begin to kick in and make you feel even more nauseous. Feeling clammy, cold, or like you're on the verge of throwing up are all possibilities. These side effects may be even worse if you took your shrooms on an empty stomach. Some of the more esoteric psychonauts out there (up there?) believe that the mushroom will only give you what you can handle \u2014 if you ingest 5 grams but are only mentally ready for 3, for example, you might not keep everything down. - Reducing nausea the natural way. Thankfully, you don't have to let nausea dampen your experience. There are several natural ways to reduce these feelings and fully enjoy your trip! One of the best natural nausea reducers is ginger root. Several studies have shown that it can inhibit the MAO-A enzyme, reducing nausea while making your trip more powerful. root's] equal to 44.1%, 42.5%, and 41.1%, respectively.\" What does all this mean? That ginger is excellent for your mood and gut health during a shroom trip and in everyday life. Fittingly enough, ginger is also one of the \"three amigos\" of traditional Chinese tea! Brew up a tea, or take ginger root in capsule form for added convenience. What to do if your mushroom trip goes dark - Don't panic! Not every mushroom trip will be sunshine and rainbows. Depending on the type of shrooms you took, the mental state you began your journey in, and many other factors, trips can get dark. While pre-trip meditation and an ideal environment (see tips 11 and 12!) can go a long way towards preventing this, it still happens. If your trip goes dark, there's just one thing you need to do: don't panic. Instead, close your eyes and breathe. - Just Breathe. More often than not, the anxiety of a bad trip is more physical than mental. So focus on the physical things you control: breathing, movement, and keeping your muscles relaxed. Focus on the rhythm of your breath, your heart, and the underlying rhythm of the universe if you're into that sort of thing (by this point, you probably will be). And remember, this too shall pass. Even 'bad' trips lead to positive long-term changes. Ego death isn't always easy, but it is always worth it! See tip #39 for more info on how dissolving your ego could help unearth the real you. - Hacking happiness. Maximizing your comfort can turn a bad trip around. Do you have a place in your apartment/house/yard that you really love? If so, migrate to that spot. Consider it your happy place for the day. Listen to that playlist you set up, sip on some warm tea, and let your mind wander. Curl up under a blanket and get comfortable. If you start to feel overwhelmed by negativity, breathe deeply, exhale, and let it go. Picture yourself surrounded by good vibes and good energy \u2014 by a universe that's working in your favour. This will be much easier if you're in a physical space you trust and enjoy. - Share with friends Still have dark thoughts? It might help to share them with a close friend. (You do have a close friend with you, right?) Be sure to share your thoughts even if they feel ridiculous. Some psychonauts, for example, report getting caught up in a bad trip and becoming convinced they'll be high forever. But the reality is that this has never happened from shrooms \u2014 and you won't be the first to experience it. A trip sitter will be able to empathize with your anxiety. They'll help bring you back to the truth that what you're going through is temporary and won't last forever. - Use the Trip Stopper. If other methods fail, don't worry. There's an even more powerful option. We formulated the [Trip Stopper](https://3amigos.co/shop/microdosing-capsules/trip-stopper/trip-stopper/) to minimize the intensity of your trip quickly and directly. Its combination of valerian root and vitamin C should be enough to noticeably improve the bad vibes. Drinking something rich in dextrose/glucose (energy drinks, tea with honey, etc) can also help bring you back to baseline sooner How to tell if you're coming down - Rearranging reality... During the peak of your trip, you probably felt the interconnectedness of everything. No, that wasn't just your imagination. Physicists are beginning to prove that all the atoms in the universe may actually be energetically connected via the Higgs boson particle (aka the \"God particle\"). Coming down from your trip, however, may take you away from this special type of perception. You'll probably start to feel pulled away as you become reintegrated into your 'normal' version of reality. Just go with the flow \u2014 reintegration isn't a bad thing. - Leaving the spirit world? If your trip had you communing with angels, alien entities, loved ones, or some version of your higher self, don't discount the experience. One [psychological questionnaire](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9522-magic-mushrooms-really-cause-spiritual-experiences/#ixzz6nUukbMTL) found that 22 of its 36 volunteers had a \"complete\" mystical experience after taking psilocybin. But these visions/portals/hallucinations will also begin to fade away as the psilocybin wears off. Does psilocybin cause visual changes? Or does it actually open up' perception enough to let you see what's really going on? The verdict's still out on that one, and you might wonder yourself as your perception slowly returns to 'normal.' - If you're hungry, then eat. If you've had an especially long-lasting trip, it might've been 8+ hours since you've eaten anything. And while shrooms definitely don't cause the munchies, it's not uncommon to notice new hunger pangs as you begin to come down. If you're hungry, eat! We'd encourage you to stick with something light and healthy-ish, though. Especially if you were experiencing any of that shroom-induced nausea earlier. - Mmm, coffee. Assuming it's not too late in the day, consider adding some coffee to your comedown routine. Many people find the energy of coffee super nourishing once they start to come down. Other warm beverages can work well, too. How you may feel afterward - Wellbeing and awe Returning to regular consciousness after a psilocybin trip can feel reassuring, wondrous, or even sacred. Have you ever returned home after a trip abroad and found yourself treasuring all the little things you used to take for granted? Yeah, same concept here. As you come back into your routine state of awareness you'll be delighted to find that everything's just how it was \u2014 except, of course, your perspective. - Piecing the \"self\" back together. \"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.\" - Carl Jung Whether we realize it or not, we all wear many hats in life. Many people find that tripping helps them distance themselves from these assumed roles and get to the heart of who they are. As you return to ordinary consciousness, it's up to you to decide which parts to leave behind and which to take. Maybe you'll realize it's finally time to put your health first and start eating healthier. Or perhaps you'll recognize using natural products for fun is okay. Regardless of your realizations, making conscious decisions like these is a way to take charge of your life and create your life story. Long term benefits of magic mushrooms - Ego death = freedom! \"Most people confuse \"self-knowledge\" with knowledge of their conscious ego personalities.\" To quote psychotherapist Carl Jung again, most people aren't exactly who they think they are. It's all too easy to select a talent, relationship, or status symbol of your choosing \u2014 one of those \"many hats\" we mentioned earlier \u2014 and make it your identity. But the real you? That's something else entirely, and psilocybin seems to help you find it. [Studies have shown](https://www.livescience.com/16287-mushrooms-alter-personality-long-term.html) that a single high-dose psilocybin trip can create lasting personality changes. Check out this report: \"People given psilocybin, the compound in 'magic mushrooms' that causes hallucinations and feelings of transcendence, demonstrated a more 'open' personality after their experience, an effect that persisted for at least 14 months. Openness is a psychological term referring to an appreciation for new experiences. \" This phenomenon is more impressive than you might think. Katherine MacLean, a researcher from The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, says it's \"one of the first studies to show that you actually can change adult personality.\" Indeed, most studies that don't dabble in psychedelics seem to say that one's personality is set in place by around 25 \u2014 or even [by first grade](https://www.livescience.com/8432-personality-set-life-1st-grade-study-suggests.html). So use shrooms to kill your ego and renew your mind. - Confidence + calm Terrence McKenna experienced quite a change of heart after his first trip. Forgiveness, healing, and reassurance came up in waves. Years later, he would describe the experience as more effective than years of psychotherapy. Paul Stamets experienced something similar. A single psilocybin trip \u2014 occurring in a treetop during a thunderstorm, of all places \u2014 was almost enough permanently to stop his stuttering. As he explained on a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPqWstVnRjQ&feature=emb_title): \"I was up there and I felt in touch with Gaia and the universe. My heart opened up I felt one with all. I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is such a powerful spiritual experience.' I said to myself, 'Stop stuttering now. Stop stuttering now.' I said that dozens, hundreds of times. Over and over and over.\" And these benefits are blessedly familiar. Many psychonauts report back from their trips with an afterglow of fresh confidence and calmness. It can be life-changing. - Understanding the dark side? Even bad trips can cause positive changes via their 'ego death' mechanism. According to one study, over 80 percent of shroom users who've experienced a \"bad trip\" say they benefited from it in the long run. Counterintuitive, right? Maybe, until you realize that we humans are multifaceted beings. Meeting our fears and shadows during a trip can help us overcome them in the long run. - Relief from addictions Speaking of fears and shadows, psilocybin may also help reduce addiction. People have successfully quit [smoking](https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/487523/can-magic-mushrooms-cure-addiction/), drinking, and using 'hard' drugs with the help of magic mushrooms. The founder of AA himself, Bill Wilson, [advocated for LSD](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/23/lsd-help-alcoholics-theory) as a way to catalyze the revelatory process of quitting drinking. [One study](https://hub.jhu.edu/2014/09/11/magic-mushrooms-smoking/) linked psilocybin use to an 80% reduction in smoking rates, while others have associated it with lower dependency on alcohol. How does all this work? [Additional research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910400/) has found that shrooms may reduce anxiety and depression, possibly reducing the need for 'crutch' substances in the first place. Microdosing Magic Mushrooms - Scalable mushroom experiences. Many people new to tripping love the experience so much that they wonder if they can do it daily. While there are certainly worse things for you ... not really. The good news, however, is that replicating the benefits of a psilocybin trip is pretty straightforward.

How to Consume Magic Mushrooms Magic Mushroom tea A popular way to consume shrooms. Steep dried shrooms in hot water for about 20 minutes, then strain and drink. Mix in some honey and ginger for a nicer flavour. The ginger also helps tone down nausea. Sip slowly for less intense effects, or drink more quickly for a faster-acting, more sustained effect. Capsules Dried, ground magic mushrooms are available in the form of capsules. They offer the benefit of not having to taste the shrooms, which definitely have their own flavour! Capsules are the preferred method for micro dosing, but they can be consumed in greater quantities for more intense effects. Capsules are great for ensuring consistent quantities. Powder Magic mushroom powder (from capsules) can be added to smoothies, juices, or other drinks. Chewing/eating dried mushrooms You can eat magic mushrooms, and this is the most common way to ingest shrooms. But the taste might be a little off-putting for some. Be sure to have something to drink nearby to wash down any shrooms or to clear the taste on your palate. Lemon tek Soak your magic mushrooms in a glass of fresh lemon juice for about 10 minutes, and then eat the wet shrooms. The acidity of the lemon juice starts to break the shrooms down, thus preparing the shrooms for digestion. That way, they digest more quickly and the active ingredients in the shrooms become available sooner. Lemon tek will bring on your trip on more quickly, but it won't last quite as long. How to Use Shrooms Safely! Here are some steps that will make your magic mushroom trip safer and more fun! Start with a low dose: Start with a low dose and increase gradually as desired. This allows time to gauge tolerance level, reducing the risk of negative experiences. START LOW, GO SLOW as they say! Be in a safe environment: Because magic mushrooms can cause changes in perception, it is important to be in a safe and comfortable environment. Don't mix with other substances: Mixing magic mushrooms with other drugs, alcohol, or medications is a bad idea. Psilocybin can interact with other substances in unpredictable ways and magnify their effects. Know your source: When buying magic mushrooms, source them from a reliable supplier. Remember you're eating shrooms, so you want to be sure they were cultivated in a clean environment. Have a positive mindset: Magic mushrooms can amplify emotions. Therefore, if someone is feeling anxious or depressed, it could trigger a bad trip. Have a trip sitter: This person remains sober and can provide calm and reassuring support if someone needs help. "}
