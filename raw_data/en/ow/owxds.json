XV Forward This manual has been prepared as an update to the 1976 Minimum Safety Guidelines for Biological Research at Yale , and the 2016 Yale University Biological Safety Manual . As with the previous manuals, we have provided a core set of biosafety practices and procedures for the safe handling of known biohazards and potentially infectious materials. Relevant sections from the previous manuals have been maintained and updated where necessary. The manual focuses on Biosafety Levels 1 and 2, as over 99% of Yale laboratories fall within these designations. A separate manual is available for researchers working in Biosafety Level 3 research laboratories. No work with Biosafety Level 4 agents may be conducted at Yale University. The Yale Office of Environmental Health and Safety Biosafety Program and the requirements for Yale researchers are outlined in the manual. Registration and training information a re provided along with details on work practices, safety equipment and facility design. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator or Supervisor to ensure that his/her laboratory is in compliance. That responsibility includes identification o f the risk or hazards associated with their research and the application of the appropriate safety procedures. Please read the section on responsibilities for additional information. In the past, the University has also distributed copies of the Centers f or Disease Control/National Institutes of Health Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories to all Yale research laboratories. The text has served as a functional biosafety manual for the University. This document and other pertinent biosaf ety training information and training materials are now available on the Office of Environmental Health and Safety Web site ( http://ehs.yale.edu ). New editions or updates will be posted on our Web site when feasible. We urge you to use the manual as a road map to compliance within your laboratory. Consult the sections relevant to your research and apply the appropriate safety procedures. The Biosafety Office is available for consultation if you have any que stion or concern with any aspect of the Biosafety Program at the University. The Environmental Health and Safety training credo, \"Think before you act,\" and \"If you do not know, ask,\" are relevant to the use of this manual. If you are unsure of a require ment or biosafety practice, please contact the Biosafety group at 785- 3550 for assistance. We also would appreciate any feedback or comments that you may have with the use of this manual, and will incorporate any suggestions in future versions. Sincerely, Craig Russell Roy, PhD.

The Chairperson, especially in the case of large departments, may share this responsibility with a departmental biological safety committee and/ or a unit director. 1.2.2 Principal Investigator The Principal Investigator has the responsibility and authority for assessing risks, establishing policies and procedures, training personnel , and maintaining the facility and equipment. The Principal Investigator is responsible for: Performing appropriate r isk assessment of research projects. The level of detail should be dependent on the hazard associated with the organism under study (e.g., an assessment of risk associated with research on BSL2 agents might reasonably be less detailed than a risk assessment of BL3 or unknown agents). Each evaluation should be completed before work is undertaken and the project should be reassessed periodically as new data is obtained. The assessment should include an analysis of the risks posed by the particular organism under investigation and of any specific research methods that may affect that risk (e.g., procedures requiring highly concentrated amounts of virus or inoculation of laboratory animals). Yale Biosafety Committee approval is required prior to initiation o f any studies or research involving human or animal pathogens. The procedures for handling unclassified agents must also be reviewed by the Yale Biological Safety Committee and the En vironmental Health and Safety Office (EHS), as well as the Yale Animal Resource Center (YARC) if work with animals is anticipated. The agents must be registered and information about these agents must be provided to the EHS . The application of appropriate safety practices and procedures withi n their laboratories and instructing students and staff of potential hazards. Approving research personnel to work in the laboratory and documenting that personnel are competent to conduct the work.

Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 2-1 2 Biosafety Requirements The following information describes the requirements for Yale researchers as defined by the Yale Biological Safety Committee and the Biosafety Office. It is the r esponsibility of each Principal Investigator to ensure the laboratory is in compliance with applicable regulations, standards, and Yale policies. 2.1 Biological General Registration All Principal Investigators are required to complete and submit a Biological G eneral Registration through Integrator . The Office of Environmental Health and Safety must maintain accurate information regarding the use of biological materials (e.g., microorganisms, cell lines, human materials, animals, and tox ins) by university perso nnel. EHS policy requires all Principal Investigators to submit accurate information annually and when there are changes during the year regarding the addition or deletion of biological materials, addition or deletion of employees or changes in room locat ions. Please note that the Biological General Registration is reviewed for compliance with the annual training requirements specified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines) and the Connecticut Department of Public Health. The Biosafety Office will assist in updating information during the annual biological and chemical safety lab inspection. The Biological General Registration is accessible at https://ehsis.yale.edu/EHSIntegrator/Registration 2.2 Human Pathogens Prior to initiating work with a human etiologic agent , approvals are required from the: Yale B iosafety Committee State of Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH) To initiate these approvals, complete and submit an Infectious Agent Registration available at https://ehsis.yale.ed u/EHSIntegrator/Registration . EHS staff will do a preliminary review of the registration . Once EHS staff approve the registration a member of the Biosafety Office present s the registration to the Yale Biosafety Committee for review and a vote to approve the registration . Biosafety Office staff will then notify the DPH and arrange for inspectors from the DPH to inspect the labs listed in the registration where work with human pathogens will be performed. In addition to the approvals above, e xperiments involving the introduction of infectious agents or potentially hazardous biological materials into animals also requires approval from the: Yale Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) Yale Animal Resources Center Many etiologic agents have been assigned a risk group level based on the degree of hazard they pose. Risk groups (RG) are numbered 1-4 with RG1 being the lowest hazard and RG4 being the highest hazard. Work with RG4 agents (e.g. lassa, sabia, and h endra vi ruses, is not permitted at Yale or in Connecticut. Risk Group 2 and higher etiologic agents are listed in the NIH Guidelines . The NIH guidelines are available at the following web address: https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/biosafety -and-recombinant -dna- activities/ . The list has been copied to Appendix B (Classification of Human Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard ) of this manual. Call the Biosafety Offi ce for assistance with agents that are not listed. All researchers working with etiologic agents (Risk Group 2 or higher) must receive training in both biosafety and the microbiological procedures that will be utilized for the experiment. Biosafety traini ng sessions are available online at https://ehs.yale.edu/biological-trainings . The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all researchers are trained in the appropriate procedures and techniques used in the laboratory. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 2-2 Staff members from EHS will periodically monitor your facility and procedures as well as answer any questions regarding biosafety. Contact a Biosafety Office staff member before : Work with a new infectious agent is initiated Changing the scope or location of existing work Adding researchers from a registration Providing infectious agents to another investigator on or off campus Arranging for visiting researchers to work in your laboratory. Work with Risk Group 3 agents (Biosafety Level 3) requires additional training and documentation; c ontact a staff member of the Biosafety Office for additional information. 2.3 Recombinant DNA Experiments Yale Biological Safety Committee approval is required prior to the initiation of non-exempt recombinant DNA experiments. A brief description of non -exempt and exempt recombinant DNA experiments is provided in the Biosafety Office document Overview of Recombinant DNA Experiments Covered by The NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recom binant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines) April 2019 available on the EHS web site at https://ehs.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/rdna - experiments- nih.pdf . Submit recombinant DNA registrations through EHS Integrator at https://ehsis.yale.edu/EHSIntegrator/Registration Contact a Biosafety Office staff member to : Register non -exempt recombinant DNA work Update current registration if the scope of the work has changed Add a new researcher(s) to the registration Ask any questions regarding recombinant DNA work. The Recombinant DNA Registration form is in Appendix E and is also on the EHS web site. The NIH guidelines are available at the following web address: https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/biosafety -and- recombinant -dna-activities/ . 2.4 Human Gene Transfer (HGT) Proposed clinical trials involving human gene transfer require registration and approval from both campus and federal agencies before initiation. The Yale University Institutional Biological Safety Committee requirements for human gene therapy protocols are detailed in \"Guidelines for Human Gene Transfer Clinical Trials\" in Appendix F. 2.5 Human Blood, Body Fluids, Tissue and Other Potentially Infectious Materials The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) created the Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, 29 CFR Part 1910.1030 (Bloodborne Pathogens Standard) to minimize or eliminate exposure to infectious agents that may be present in human blood, tissues or certain body fluids (bloodborne pathogens.) The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard applies to all employers having employees that are exposed to human blood or other potentially infected materials. Employees with a reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with human blood or other potentially infectious materials in the performance of their duties is considered occupationally exposed. Other potentially infectious materials include: Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 2-3 Human cell or tissue cultures (primary and established) Organ cultures Any unfixed tissue or organ, other than intact skin, from a human being (living or dead) HIV- or HBV - containing culture media or other solutions Human body fluids, except urine, feces, saliva, or tears unless visibly contaminated with blood Blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV or other bloodborne pathogens An individual is also considered occupationally exposed if they do not have direct contact with blood or other potentially infectious material, if the employee uses equipment that is used to process or store blood, other potentially infectious materials or bloodborne pathogens. A risk assessment must be completed to confirm the potenti al for exposure in these cases. All occupationally exposed employees are required by OSHA to attend a Bloodborne Pathogens training session prior to beginning work and annually thereafter. There are additional requirements for research laboratories and production facilities engaged in the culture, production, concentration and manipulation of HIV and HBV. OSHA has determined that occupational exposure to human blood, tissues and body fluids poses a significant health risk because these may contain bloodborne pathogens such as: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Babesia species Human T-lymphotropic virus Type I Hepatitis B virus (HBV) Borrelia species Arboviruses Hepatitis D virus Brucella species Spirillum minus Hepatitis C virus Leptospira species Creutzfeldt -Jakob virus Plasmodium species Francisella species Colorado tick fever viruses Treponema species Streptobacillus moniliformis Hemorrhagic fever viruses Consult the Bloodborne Pathogen Training Manual for additional information . The manual is available on the EHS web site at https://ehs.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/bbp -training -manual.pdf . Contact the Biosafety Office at 785 -3550 for assistance with exposure determination and for training information. 2.6 Animals All research experiments involving animals must be conducted in accordance with the associated Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC) approved protocol. Animal research that involves a hazard (biological, radiological, or chemical) must have a Request to Use Hazardous Agents in Animals form filed with the associated protocol and be reflected in the approved IACUC protocol. Contact the IACUC at (203) 785-5992 for additional information. Once approved, the Yale Animal Resources Center (YARC) must be contacted prior to initiation to ensure that a safety protocol will be established. Researchers must meet with YARC personnel and the relevant safety personnel to outline standard operating pr ocedures. An orientation to the assigned animal housing area will be provided. Call (203) 785-2526 for additional information. The Biosafety Office must approve work with human pathogens or recombinant DNA in animals (including transgenic animals) prior t o initiation. Contact the Biosafety Office to initiate the approval process. For additional information please contact the I ACUC at (203) 785-5992 or YARC at (203) 785-2526. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 2-4 2.7 Biosafety Cabinets (BSCs) and Other Laminar Flow Benches (LFBs The Clean Air Devi ce Program was designed to ensure the health and safety of Yale employees, to protect research and clinical materials, as well as to prevent the environmental release of infectious materials. All BSCs and LFBs at Yale must be placed on the Yale University certification/service contract and be certified at least annually. Any BSCs or LF Bs not on the certification/service contract will be placed in storage status. EHS will contact you to schedule the required annual certification. Notify the Biosafety Office in advance when you plan to have BSCs or LF Bs moved, placed in storage, transferred to a new owner, discarded, removed from Yale or obtained from another institution or manufacturer. Contact the Biosafety Office if service or repairs (e.g., replacing fl uorescent lamps, switches, etc.) are needed for your unit. BSCs must be professionally decontaminated with formaldehyde, by a certified technician, before a unit is relocated, stored, serviced (interior) or discarded. The purchase of BSCs and other LF Bs is coordinated through the Yale University Procurement Department and the Biosafety Office. The Biosafety Office reviews all BSC and LF B purchase requests. Contact the Biosafety Office for more information. Yale actively discourages the purchase and use of LF Bs since air is blown across the work surface into the face and torso of the operator. If you are using a LFB, contact the Biosafety Office for a review of your procedures. For additional information on policies, procedures and use of BSCs consult the Clean Air Device Guide on the EHS web site or contact the Biosafety Office at 785 -3550. 2.8 Training Successful completion of a range of biosafety training programs may be required prior to the initiation of your research at Yale University. Please review t he following table for information on required training. You can access online EHS training s at https://ehs.yale.edu/biological- trainings or by calling 785 -3550. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact a Biosafety representative at 78 5-3550. Before initiating work involving: You must satisfactorily complete the following training: Training Options Human blood, other potentially infectious materials, human cell lines and bloodborne pathogens.

The purpose of the program is to conduct periodic health asse ssments of employees, with attention devoted to factors or conditions associated with a particular biological agent a given individual might handle. For a particular employee, the medical surveillance program might call for any of a number of precautionar y measures, including immunizations, a periodic examination or collection of a serum specimen. The purpose of the medical surveillance program is to: recommend appropriate medical precautions to be followed, and do periodic reassessment of employees to determine if medical conditions associated with employment are present and, if so, to undertake definitive measures to alleviate them. The extent of medical surveillance for a given employee will vary greatly and be dependent upon: the nature of the research project in which involved, the biological agents to which directly or potentially exposed, and certain additional factors relating to the current or previous health status of the individual. The Principal Investi gator is to provide Employee Health with guidelines and descriptions of conditions that might have significance for personnel assigned to the laboratory. Medical surveillance is provided without charge for any employee of Yale University whose job may resu lt in potential exposure. For more information about this program contact the Department of Employee Health at (203) 432- 7978. 3.1 Tuberculosis (TB) Screening Employees who face occupational exposure to Tuberculosis (TB) are enrolled in the University's Tuber culosis Exposure Control Plan. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has identified workers from the following areas as potentially exposed: Healthcare facilities Long term care facilities Correctional facilities Homeless shelters Substance ab use treatment facilities Laboratories that may handle M. tuberculosis New employees at risk must be tested for TB exposure by a tuberculin skin test (PPD) at time of hire (within 2 weeks of start date) to establish a baseline. Employees who have been exp osed to active TB cases must report the incident and undergo an initial baseline TB test at time of exposure and a follow up test at 8 -10 weeks post exposure. Please contact Employee Health at (203) 432-7978 to arrange for PPD testing and for additional i nformation regarding the University's TB Exposure Control Plan. Contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety at 785 - 3550 for information on TB training. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 3-2 3.2 Immunizations In certain situations, personnel engaged in particular research activities should be immunized with appropriate vaccines, such as rabies, rubella and measles. Vaccines not commonly available will be obtained, whenever possible, for those engaged in specific research with potential exposure to the agent in question. Vaccine Recommend ations Rabies Vaccine Recommended for all personnel entering laboratories or animal facilities with rabies vaccination entrance requirements. Hepatitis B Vaccine Recommended for persons working with human blood, body fluids or tissues. Vaccinia Vaccine Prior to working with vaccinia, employees are required to receive a medical evaluation and counseling from Employee Health regarding vaccinia immunization. In cases where infected animals are not housed in filter -top cages or other primary containment devices, vaccination shall be required for room entry. Arboviruses: Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis Vaccines, Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Vaccine, Yellow Fever Vaccine, Rift Valley Fever Vaccine Prior to working with arboviruses, employees are required to receive a medical evaluation and counseling from Employee Health regarding possible immunization. Other vaccines such as Salmonella typhi (Typhoid), To be determined by the Employee Health Physician. In some cases, appropriate follow- up serum samples will be collected to measure vaccine -induced antibodies when indicated. 3.3 Medical Restrictions 3.3.1 Pregnancy It is recognized that exposure to certain infectious agents may adversely affect a fetus during pregnancy if t he mother is infected with the agent. Therefore, if pregnancy is possible while you are working in an infectious disease laboratory or laboratory engaged in work with infectious agents you should consult your Principal Investigator or supervisor. The Department of Employee Health is also available for questions regarding the potential harm from the biological agents present within your laboratory. Women that are pregnant or become pregnant are encouraged to inform their supervisors or Principal Investigat ors and Employee Health. Employees are urged to discuss exposure issues with their supervisors or Principal Investigator s regarding associated risks of research being conducted and pregnancy . Employee Health will give advice about precautions that might be necessary. Employee Health is a resource for pregnant women to ask about any questions or concerns they may have regarding risks in their work environment. Employee Health may also act as a liaison to make recommendations to the respective supervisors or Principal Investigator s. 3.3.2 Reproductive Biological Hazards The Employee Health Physician will offer confidential counseling to any woman or man of childbearing age working with reproductive pathogens or other potentially infectious materials. Reproducti ve biological hazards include, but are not limited to the following: Yale University Biosafety Manual - July pox) Whenever necessary, Employee Health along with the Biosafety Office will offer an opportunity to review work procedures in the lab to ensure that potential exposure is minimized. Consideration for reassignment to other tasks that don't involve e xposure to the known reproductive hazard (generally with actual pathogens, not necessarily for only other potentially infectious materials such as blood or body fluids) will be discussed and can be reviewed per university human resources policies. Also, In vestigators actively working with reproductive hazards are to explain the risk assessment at time of hire. 3.3.3 Other Restrictions Restrictions or recommendations will be made on an individual basis after discussion with the Employee Health Physician and the employee's personal medical doctor. Examples of conditions that might warrant special precautions are immunosuppressive conditi ons and drug therapies that suppress the immune system. Therefore, if you are suffering from any of the above conditions, you must inform your physician and the Department of Employee Health about the situation. 3.4 Employee Serum Storage Many infections do not result in an overt disease condition. Such infections are detected by development of antibodies to the agent in question. Therefore, Employee Health has established a program for perso ns engaged in BL3 research, which includes collection of pre- assignment serum. A dditional serum samples will be collected If an illness occurs which may be related to the agent the person is working with . Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 4-1 4 Accidents 4.1 Emergency Procedures f or Exposure Incidents An \"exposure incident\" is specific contact (eye, mouth, other mucous membrane, respiratory tract via inhalation, non- intact skin, or parenteral) with potentially infectious materials that results from the performance of an employee's duties. An employee who sustains a known or potential exposure incident must remove gloves and treat the affected area immediately by following the appropriate exposure incident response below. 4.1.1 Percutaneous Injury Wash the affected area with antiseptic so ap and warm water for 15 minutes. 4.1.2 Splash to Face Flush affected area in eyewash for 15 minutes. 4.1.3 Aerosol Exposure Hold your breath and immediately leave room. Remove Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) carefully. When removing PPE make sure to turn the exposed areas inward. Wash hands well with soap and water. Post spill sign on lab entry; lab should be evacuated for at least 30 minutes. PI must clear lab for re -entry. For extensive BSL2 contamination (i.e. centrifuge incident) or incidents involving BSL2+ or BL3 agents, EHS must be notified and will assume responsibility, in conjunction with the PI, to clear the laboratory for re -entry. 4.2 Reporting Incident The employee must report the incident to his/her supervisor. The supervisor must complete a Depar tment Head's Report of Injury form and a Health Service Report form documenting the route of exposure and the circumstances under which the incident occurred. 4.3 Medical Assistance Employees are urged to call Employee Health (432- 0071) after they have received proper available first aid at site of exposure. For certain exposures; such as non -human primate bites or scratches, tick or insect bites, or exposure to infectious agents; th e employee will be advised to come in and be evaluated by Employee Health. In situations when Employee Health is not available or if more extensive treatment is required, the employee will be referred to the Acute Care department and given a follow up vis it with Employee Health. University Health Services will provide the post -exposure evaluation and follow -up at no cost to employees who experience \" exposure incidents \". The post -exposure monitoring periods are dependent on the type of exposure. This time period is related to the various incubation periods of the infectious agents. Employees can obtain copies of their medical records by contacting Yale Health . These records are kept by the Medical Records Department, 55 Lock Street , (203) 432-0062. Yale University must retain medical records for your duration of employment plus 30 years. 4.4 Investigation of Laboratory Accidents The Office of Environmental Health and Safety, in cooperation with the Principal Investigator and his or her staff, will conduct the necessary investigation of a laboratory accident. The goal of the investigation is the prevention of similar accidents as well as obtaining information concerning the circumstances and number of employees who have been exposed to the age nt in question. In addition, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety, in consultation with Employee Health might institute further steps to monitor the health of those who may have been exposed to the agent in question. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 4-2 It should be emphasized that the reporting of accidents to the Principal Investigator or laboratory supervisor is the responsibility of the employee who has the accident. The Principal Investigator or the laboratory supervisor should then report the incident to Employee Health at Yal e Health , 55 Lock Street . Please also report incidents that did not result in an exposure (near miss) to EHS. Evaluation of near misses can lead to alternative work practices and implementation of engineering controls to minimize future incidents. Whenev er an injury involves a sharp and human material (body fluid, tissue, cell line, etc.) the Biosafety Office must perform an investigation to determine if a safe sharps device is available to prevent future occurrences of the injury. If safe sharps devices are available, they must be evaluated by the biosafety office in conjunction with the Group or Department. The incident must also be recorded on the University's Sharps Injury Log, maintained by the Worker's Compensation Office. The confidential log wil l include the type and brand of device involved in the incident; the Department or work area where the exposure incident occurred; and an explanation of how the incident occurred. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 5-1 5 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Responsibility for biosafety exists at all levels and is shared throughout the University. The President and Provost acknowledge the institution's role in providing a safe workplace and have give n the Biological Safety Committee and Biosafety Office the authority to administer the campus biosafety program. The Biological Safety Committee establishes policies for the safe use of biohazards and for compliance with all applicable regulations. As an agent of the Committee, the Biosafety Office disseminates pertinent information; consults with faculty, staff, students , and visitors; and monitors for non-compliance. The researchers, clinicians, and technicians who perform work with biohazards are perhaps the most important component of the biosafety program, as they must incorporate the biosafety requirements and safety precautions into all facets of their work. The Principal Investigator is ultimately responsible for safety within the laboratory. An integral part of this responsibility is to conduct a review of proposed work to identify potential hazards (risk assessment) and to adopt appropriate safety procedures and the use of containment equipment before initiation of the experiments (risk management). Certain experiments require advanced registration and Biological Safety Committee approval prior to initiation (See Section 2). A risk assessment/risk management matrix has been prepared to illustrate key elements of the process (see below). Relevant sections providing additional details are indicated within the matrix. Information on the routes of exposure is included at the end of this section. The six P's of risk assessment and risk management are: Pathogen - hazardous biological agent. Proced ures - proposed experimental manipulations Personnel - appropriate training and skills. Practices - significant work practices Protective equipment - protective clothing and safety equipment. Place - laboratory design. Further information on the 6 P's of Risk Assessment and Risk Management are discussed here. Risk Assessment PATHOGEN review Review of all proposed PROCEDURES with the biohazard PERSONNEL evaluation Risk Management Formulation of work PRACTICES to mitigate identified risks Selection of PROTEC TIVE EQUIPMENT to place barriers between staff and the biohazard Utilization of a PLACE or lab that is suitable for the proposed research Step 1: Pathogen (Gather ALL information on the biohazard or agent) Download the Pathogen July 2020 5-2 Obtain the Agent Summary Statement from the CDC/NIH BMBL if available (https://www.cdc.gov/labs/BMBL.html) Understand the signs an d symptoms of infection Learn preventive therapies (immunizations and post -exposure treatment ) If a pathogen is antibiotic resistant or resistant to a commonly used therapy, know which treatments will be effective against the pathogen; this is especially i mportant in the event of an exposure Know all clinical syndromes that can be caused by the agent Identify what medical conditions may make a person more susceptible or at higher risk of infection or serious disease Let staff know to seek counsel from Emplo yee Health prior to starting work with biohazards for a private consult regarding their health status Identify the incubation period, the infectious dose, the starting Risk Group Do a web search for laboratory -acquired infections with the proposed biohazar d and identify how it was transmitted if known Learn and understand how the biohazard is transmitted in nature and in a lab setting Review unnatural exposure routes with staff, including aerosol deposition to lower lung, aerosol contamination of mucous membranes, aerosol contamination of surfaces, hand to face (eyes, nose, and mouth) transfer of pathogens, eye to nasal cavity to back of throat to gut transmission Find out how long the biohazard can survive on surfaces or the environment List the disinfec tants that are effective at inactivating the biohazard and identify the concentration of the disinfectant and contact time required for kill Highlight pertinent risk assessment information and share with your staff (list at start of site- specific standard operating procedures) Post unique risk information on the lab door biohazard sign to ensure all visitors are informed of potential risks Step 2: Procedures (review all proposed procedures with the biohazard or agent) Identify and list all the procedures, equipment and supplies that will be used in your research or lab protocol Ensure that every step is included, from removal of the biohazard from the freezer, transport to work areas, all protocol steps, through decontamination and disinfection and/or return to frozen storage Identify any steps performed outside your lab, such as in core facilities (i.e. specialized microscopy, flow cytometry) and any shared equipment locations Once all the steps, supplies and equipment have been documented and written down, identify all the risks and potential exposures that could possibly occur during the course of the work (splashes, splatter, spills, aerosols, cuts, lacerations, punctures, bites, scratches, etc.) o Pay particular attention to punctures from contaminated shar ps (if not working with animals - eliminate sharps and use plastic alternatives!) o Any step with a liquid can generate splash or splatter that could contact facial mucous membranes, skin, or personal clothing and contact surrounding work areas o Procedures th at impart energy to a culture (basically all of them) from pipetting to vortexing to centrifugation and highlight these steps that may produce aerosols For animal experiments consider the use of sharps for inoculation, bites and scratches from the animal, exposure to bedding contaminated from excretion of the biohazard Identify the potential for spills (dropped flasks, broken flasks in shakers, leaks in centrifuges, etc.) Write down all the steps and risks identified and detail the potential for exposure (t his is your required written site -specific risk assessment!) Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 5-3 PAUSE: ask your Biosafety Officer or assigned Safety Advisor to review your risk assessment at this point. Also ask your IACUC, IBC or IRB rep , where applicable, to review. Your b iosafety officer will confirm your r isk assessment and help identify any procedures with potential risk that may have been missed. Update your written risk assessment after this review. Step 3: Personnel Evaluation (review who will be handling biohazards) Do all st aff have prior experience working with this biohazard or very similar biohazards? If not, an internship to gain hands -on experience with the agent can be arranged with another lab or within your lab Have all staff completed all required Biosafety and other applicable laboratory safety trainings prior to initiating work? Do staff have a positive safety attitude and a healthy amount of respect for the risks involved with the proposed biohazard? Have the proposed staff exhibited a strong safety record in the lab? Are all staff informed of the risks presented by this work and the proposed procedures? o Are any staff at greater risk due to their health status? Have they met with and been cleared by Employee Health? This discussion of likely elevated risks and revi ew of proposed participation is critical o Do any staff have contraindications with any of the pre- or post -exposure treatment options? Has a suitable treatment been identified for them if they are? Have you documented the proficiency of the staff with the l ab protocols and the associated biocontainment practices required to mitigate risks? Invariably, your biosafety training will cover a lot of Risk Management. Risk Management includes the Biosafety Work PRACTICES that will help to reduce or minimize the op portunity for exposure in the lab. This includes the elimination of sharps for lab procedures by the substitution with plastic alternatives. The identification of PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT which is a combination of : the personal protective clothing (lab coats or gowns, gloves - double gloves for higher risk work, face protection - chin length face shield, safety glasses or goggles and a mask); and all engineering controls such as a biological safety cabinet, bench shields, sharps containers, vacuum system filte rs, biomedical waste containers, etc. that will be used to place a barrier between the biohazard and the staff. The final element of Risk Management is to review all the PLACES (lab spaces) where this research will be conducted. Verify that all air flows into these laboratories and not the opposite, that all surfaces are easily cleanable, and benches are resistant to the disinfectants and other chemicals that will be used. Examine the impact of foot traffic in these locations and select times where this w ill be at a minimum when scheduling the times biohazards will be used there. Once again, after you've detailed your written risk assessment and have crafted biocontainment standard operating procedures (SOP) for the proposed research or work, please cont act your Biosafety Officer or assigned safety representative to schedule a walkthrough laboratory inspection to verify the suitability of the protective measures and the appropriateness of the proposed lab locations. The Biosafety Officer's report will be required by the Institutional Biosafety Committee prior to their final review and approval of your protocol to use a biohazard or regulated biological material. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 5-4 Consider the 6 P's in each facet of laboratory work. Properly conducted, risk assessment ca n help prevent exposure to biohazards and minimize the potential for laboratory acquired infection. Remember that prior planning prevents poor performance. After reading this section and relevant sections of the Biological Safety Manual contact the Biosaf ety Office at 785- 3550 for help applying the principles of risk assessment and risk management to experimental procedures.

Routes of entry include oral, respiratory, parenteral, mucous membrane and animal contacts (bites, scratches). Once inside the body, biohazards must meet other requirements to cause disease; they must colonize and establish in body cells, tissues and/or organs, overcome the body's natural defense mechanisms and mutate or adapt to body changes. Other factors contribute to an individual's susceptibility to t he disease process. These include age, immunological state, occupation, physical and geographic environment and predisposing conditions (such as alcoholism and other drug abuse, pregnancy and diseases such as diabetes). It is difficult to determine a minimum infectious dose when discussing biohazards. The same dose of a pathogen may produce no disease symptoms in one individual but may cause serious or even fatal disease in another. There are microorganisms for which it is thought one or ganism entering the body is sufficient to invade and promote the disease process; the bacteria that causes tuberculosis is an example. For many pathogens, 10 to 100 or more organisms must enter the body to cause infection leading to disease. See the table below for additional information on routes of exposure or contact the Biosafety Office at 785-3550. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 5-8 Routes of Transmission for Infectious Agents Mucous Membranes: Exposures to mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth through splashes or splatters.

Be sure to remove PPE prior to leaving the laboratory Never mouth pipette, always use mechanical pipettors Use extreme caution when working with sharps Contain aerosols by using appropriate equipment Decontaminate work surfaces, spills and waste 5.3 Biosafety levels The CDC and NIH have established four biosafety levels for work with biohazardous materials in the publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL). The publication provides combinations of microbiological practices, laboratory facilities, and safety equipment as well as their recommended use in four biosafet y levels (B SL) of laboratory operation with selected agents infectious to humans. Also included in the BMBL is a parallel set of biosafety levels for research involving small laboratory animals. Below is a summary of practices, equipment and facility requirements for agents assigned to biosafety levels 1 -3 (BSL 1 -3). Additional information on biosafety levels may be found in Appendix C as well as in the BMBL, which is available from the Biosafety Office and on the World Wide Web at http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm . Only work at biosafety levels 1 -3 is permitted at Yale University. No biosafety level 4 work is allowed at Yale University.

Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 6-1 6 Signs and Labels Signs and labels are to be posted where biohazardous materials requiring containment at BSL2 or higher are used and /or stored. The information on the sign or label will vary depending on the use of the sign or label. The design specifications of the biohazard symbol were established in 1966 and the same specifications are still used today . The colors used on biohazard label s can vary by country; in the United States the biohazard label has an ora nge background with the biohazard symbol and the word \"Biohazard\" pr inted in black. 6.1 Entryway Signs 6.1.1 Door Signs An EHS door sign must be posted at the entryway to all laboratories. Door signs provide the following information to those entering the lab including emergency responders such as police and fire personnel . Front of door sign: Building and room number Name and phone number of all PIs using the room Name and phone number of research personnel knowledgeable about the materials used in the space Areas where biohazards requiring BSL2 or higher containment are used and/ or stored will labeled with the biohazard symbol, including the word \"Biohazard\", and the bio safety level of the facility Symbols indicating that chemicals and /or radioactive material s, as appropriate, are used in the space Other potential hazards (e.g. gas cylinders) Requirements to enter the lab (e.g. safety glasses) The availability and location of safety equipment (e.g. an eyewash is available in the room and the hall) Back of door sign: A list of emergency contact personnel and their emergency phone number (e.g. cell phone number) Identification of materials requiring BSL2 or higher containment (e.g. human materials, infectious agents) used or stored in the area List of radionuclid es used or stored in the area Other hazards present in the area (e.g. gas cylinders) Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 6-2 The Safety Advisor for your area can provide you with the required door sign. 6.1.2 Biosafety Level Entryways to research and clinical areas where materials requiring BSL2 containment such as human blood or other potentially infectious materials must be posted with a biohazard sign that contains the universal biohazard symbol, the legend \"Biohazard\" and the term BSL2 . Entryways to research areas that handle BL3 material must be posted with a similar sign replacing the term BSL2 with BL3. 6.2 Biohazard Door Signs HIV and HBV research and production facilities, laboratories where work with infectious agents that cause the facility to have special entry requirements ( e.g. vaccination), BSL2 + and BL3 laboratories must have a biohazard door sign posted on all access doors. The sign includes the following: International biohazard symbol The word \"Biohazard\", The name of the infectious agent Any special entrance requiremen ts The name and phone numbers of the Principal Investigator or other responsible person. The door signs shall be fluorescent orange -red (or predominantly so) with lettering or symbols in a contrasting color. An example of a door sign is on the next page. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 6-3 Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 6-4 6.3 Labels Inside the facility, biohazard labels shall be affixed to equipment used with or storing human blood or \"other potentially infectious material\" ; human, animal or plant pathogens ; or materials requiring a recombinant DNA registration . Containers used to transport the above materials must also be labeled with a biohazard label. The name of the material(s) requiring the lab must be identified on, or adjace nt to the label as shown in the example below. Equipment decontaminated after each use do not require a permanent biohazard label. In these situations, a biohazard label can be temporarily posted on the equipment while in use with a biohazard and the label removed once the equipment has been decontaminated. 6.4 Labeling Equipment Sent Out for Repair or Disposal Contaminated and potentially contaminated equipment sent out for repair or disposal must be decontaminated as thoroughly as possible. Affix a Bios afety Notice (shown below) to the equipment indicating when the equipment was decontaminated, what disinfectant was used, and the name of the person who performed the decontamination. Thorough decontamination of highly technical or sensitive equipment or equipment with limited access to contaminated areas may not be possible. Decontaminate the equipment to the degree possible (flushing lines and/or wiping down the exterior) and affix a Biosafety Notice to the equipment, be sure to indicate which area(s) o f the equipment could not be decontaminated. Place a biohazard label on the equipment indicating the name of the biohazardous material that remains and the location of the contaminated area. The label must convey this information to all affected workers (service representatives, manufacturer, etc.). The Biosafety Notice is available on the EHS web site. . Human material Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 7-1 7 Laboratory Practices In this section, an attempt has been made to provide information regarding hazards involved with certain labora tory practices and methods for preventing them. Prevention is an important element to biohazard control, and it is recommended that anyone working in a laboratory read this section carefully. 7.1 Human Factors and Attitudes in Relation to Laboratory Accidents For the purpose of safety, an attitude can be defined as an accumulation of information and experience that predisposes an individual to certain behavior. Human factors and attitudes result in tendencies on the part of the individual to react in a positive or negative fashion to a situation, a person or an objective. Laboratory supervisors and Principal Investigators should understand the importance of attitudes and human factors in their own efforts to control biohazards in their laboratory. Some obser vations that may be of help to supervisors are listed below: The lack of accident perception ability is often a significant factor in laboratory accidents. Inflexibility of work habits, that tend to preclude last minute modification when an accident situation is recognized, plays a part in the causation of some laboratory accidents. Working at an abnormal rate of speed is a significant causal factor. Intentional violations of regulations are a frequent cause of accidents. This is termed excessive risk taking. The performance of routine procedures such as diluting and plating cultures is the most frequent task being performed at the time of laboratory accidents. Working when one is very tired is more likely to create a higher potential for accidents. Working at a well -organized and uncrowded laboratory bench will help in the prevention of lab accidents. Each employee working with biohazardous agents must be consistently aware of the importance of the proper attitude in preventing accidents in the labora tory. 7.2 Biosafety Level 1 Keep laboratory door closed when experiments are in progress. Use procedures that minimize aerosols. Do not smoke, eat, drink or store food in BSL1 areas. Wear laboratory gowns or coats when appropriate. Do not mouth pipette. Use m echanical pipetting devices. Avoid using hypodermic needles. Wash hands after completing experimental procedures and before leaving laboratory. Disinfect work surfaces daily and immediately after a spill. Decontaminate all biological wastes before discard. Decontaminate other contaminated materials before washing, reuse, or discard. For off-site decontamination, package contaminated materials in closed, durable, leakproof containers. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 7-2 Control insect and rodent infestations. Keep areas neat and clean. 7.3 Biosaf ety Level 2 Keep laboratory door closed. Post a universal biohazard label on equipment where infectious agents are used/stored. Allow only persons informed of the research to enter BSL2 areas. Keep animals not used in B SL2 experiment out of the laboratory. Do not smoke, eat, drink, store food or apply cosmetics in BSL2 areas. Wear PPE (laboratory gowns or coats, gloves and full -face protection) when appropriate; do not wear PPE outside of the laboratory. Wash hands after removing PPE as well as before leaving laboratory. Change PPE when soiled or compromised. Do not mouth pipette. Use mechanical pipetting devices. Use procedures that minimize aerosol formation. Avoid using hypodermic needles. Substitute plastic for glass where feasible. Use biological safety cabinets to contain aerosol -producing equipment. Wash hands after completing experimental procedures and before leaving laboratory. Disinfect work surfaces daily and immediately after a spill. Maintain a biological spill kit within the laboratory. Report spills, accidents, near misses and disease symptoms related to laboratory acquired infection to the PI. Ensure that all biomedical waste containers are labeled with the biohazard symbol. Decontaminate all biological wastes before discard. Decontamin ate other contaminated materials before washing, reuse, or discard. For off-site decontamination, package contaminated materials in closed, durable, leakproof containers. Control insect and rodent infestations. Keep areas neat and clean. 7.4 Biosafety Level 2+ Biosafety level 2+ (B SL2+) is the designation utilized for those biohazard experiments that require practices that are more stringent than standard B SL2 procedures. Generally, BL3 practices are mandated in a space designed for BSL2 work. It is preferred that the B SL2 laboratory be self -contained with all equipment required for the experiment located within the laboratory. A biohazard door sign listing the agent in use, emergency contact, and entry requirements is posted on the door while B SL2+ work is i n progress and access is restricted to those involved in the experiment. When work is completed and equipment has been decontaminated, the sign is removed and the laboratory is returned to standard BSL2 or BSL1 use. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 7-3 All manipulations of B SL2+ material are conducted in a class II biological safety cabinet and secondary containment is utilized for centrifugation and other potential aerosol generating procedures. Additional requirements for work at B SL2+ are listed in Appendix C. Please consult the Biosafety Office prior to initiating any work at B SL2+. Detailed information on BSL3 work practices is provided in the Yale Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) manual. The BSL3 Manual is available on the Yale EHS website under Biosafety Policies and Procedures. 7.5 Cell Culture Wear long sleeved gowns with knit cuffs and long gloves when working in the biosafety cabinet. Glassware and other contaminated items should be disinfected or autoclaved before washing, reuse or disposal. Glassware should be thoroughly cleaned and rinsed, by washing repeatedly with tap water and distilled water. Cell culture wastes must be decontaminated. Maintain a clean lab coat reserved solely for cell culture work. Avoid talking during culture manipulations as aerosols may be drawn into the work area. Place pipettes on a rack to avoid disrupting airflow when removed. Keep open tubes parallel to the airflow. After transferring inoculum always recap vials. Do not place tubes on work surface. Discard empty tubes immediately. Work with one specimen at a tim e; recap before going to the next. Autoclave verification should be performed routinely. If a problem with contamination develops please refer to Appendix G of this manual and call the Biosafety Office for further assistance. 7.6 Transport of Biohazards on Cam pus (between labs or buildings): Must have two leakproof containers, including the following: A sealed primary container A sealed secondary container Absorbent (paper towels) between the primary and secondary containers suitable for the volume transported A biohazard sticker on the outside of the secondary container with agent name Lab address and phone number on the outside of the secondary container Utilize plastic containers whenever feasible; avoid glass. Sealed plastic (not glass) primary vials can be transported within sealed, labeled plastic bags. If glass primary containers must be used, place containers within a sealed rigid plastic container with absorbent and padding to cushion vials during transport. Decontaminated the outside of the primary co ntainer before placing into the secondary container. Decontaminate the secondary container before leaving the laboratory. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 7-4 Research materials may not be transported on any of the Yale shuttles, public transportation, or in personal vehicles. Please contact EHS if you need to transport materials between Yale campuses. 7.7 Basic Microbiological Practices Culture Plates, Tubes and Bottles In the absence of definite accidents or obvious spillage, it is not certain that the opening of plates, tubes and bottles of ot her microorganisms has caused laboratory infection. However, it is probable that among the highly infective agents some infections have occurred by this means. Particular care is required when opening plates, tubes, or bottles containing fungi, for this operation may release a large number of spores. Such cultures should be manipulated in a biological safety cabinet. To assure a homogenous suspension that will provide a representative sample, liquid cultures are agitated before a sample is taken. Vigoro us shaking will create a heavy aerosol. A swirling action will generate homogenous suspension with a minimum of aerosol. When a liquid culture is re -suspended, a few minutes should elapse prior to opening the container to reduce the aerosol. The insertio n of a sterile, hot wire loop or needle into a liquid or slant culture can cause spattering and release of an aerosol. To minimize the aerosol production, the loop should be allowed to cool in the air or be cooled by touching it to the inside of the conta iner or to the agar surface where no growth is evident prior to contact with the culture of colony. Following use of inoculating loop or needle, it is preferable to sterilize the instrument in an electric or gas incinerator specifically designed for this purpose rather than heating in an open flame. These small incinerators have a shield to contain any material that may spatter from the loop or needle. Disposable inoculating loops are available commercially. Rather than decontaminating them immediately after use with heat, they are discarded first into a disinfectant solution. The practice of streaking an inoculum on rough agar results in aerosol production created by the vibrating loop or needle. This generally does not occur if the operation is perfor med on smooth agar. It is good safety practice to discard all rough agar poured plates that are intended for streaking purposes with a wire loop. Water of syneresis in Petri dish cultures usually contains viable microorganisms and forms a film between the rim and lid of the inverted plate. Aerosols are dispersed when opening the plate breaks this film. Vented plastic Petri dishes, where the lid touches the rim at only three points, are less likely to offer this hazard. The risk may also be minimized by using properly dried plates, but even these (when incubated anaerobically) are likely to be wet after removal from an anaerobic jar. Filter papers fitted into the lids reduce, but do not prevent dispersal. If plates are obviously wet, they should be opened in the biological safety cabinet. Less obvious is the release of aerosols when screw-capped bottles or plugged tubes are opened. This happens when a film of contaminated liquid, which may collect between the rim and the liner, is broken during removal of the closure. The practice of removing cotton plugs or other closures from flasks, bottles, centrifuge tubes, etc., immediately following shaking or centrifugation can generate aerosols and cause environmental contamination. The technique of shaking ti ssue cultures with glass beads to release viruses can create a virus-laden aerosol. Removal of wet closures, which can occur if the flask or centrifuge tube is not held in an upright position, is also hazardous. In addition, when using the centrifuge, th ere may be a small amount of foaming and the closures may become slightly moistened. Because of these possibilities, it is good safety practice to open all liquid cultures of infectious or hazardous material in a biological safety cabinet wearing gloves and a long-sleeved laboratory garment. Dried, infectious culture material may also collect at or near the rim or neck of culture tubes/flasks and may be dispersed into the air when disturbed. Containers of dry powdered hazardous materials should be opened in a biological safety cabinet. Ampoules Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 7-5 When a sealed ampoule containing a lyophilized or liquid culture is opened an aerosol may be created. Aerosol creation should be prevented or minimized; opening of ampoules should be done in biological safety cabin ets. When recovering the contents of an ampoule, care should be taken not to cut the gloves or hands or disperse broken glass into eyes, face, or laboratory environment. In addition, the biological product itself should not be contaminated with foreign organisms or with disinfectants. To accomplish this, work in a biological safety cabinet and wear gloves. Nick the ampoule with a file near the neck. Wrap the ampoule in disinfectant wetted cotton. Snap the ampoule open at the nick, being sure to hold t he ampoule upright. Alternatively, at the file mark on the neck of the ampoule, apply a hot wire or rod to develop a crack. Then wrap the ampoule in disinfected wetted cotton and snap it open. Discard cotton and ampoule tip into disinfectant. The conte nts of the ampoule are reconstituted by slowly adding fluid to avoid aerosolizing the dried material. Mix contents without bubbling and withdraw the contents into a fresh container. Some researchers may desire to use commercially available ampoules pre-s cored for easy opening. However, there is the possibility to consider that this may weaken the ampoule and cause it to break during handling and storage. Ampoules of liquid cultures are opened in a similar way. Ensure that all hazardous fluid cultures or viable powdered infectious materials in glass vessels are transported, incubated, and stored in easily handled, non-breakable leakproof secondary containers that are large enough to contain all the fluid or powder in case of leakage or breakage of the gla ss vessel. The secondary container must be labeled with a biohazard label bearing the name of the infectious material. Embryonated Eggs Harvesting cultures from embryonated eggs is a hazardous procedure and leads to heavy surface contamination of the egg trays, shells, the environment, and the hands of the operator. It is essential that operations of this type be conducted in a biological safety cabinet. A suitable disinfectant should be at hand and used frequently. 7.8 Housekeeping Well -defined housekeeping procedures and schedules are essential in reducing the risks associated with working with pathogenic agents and in protecting the integrity of the research program. This is particularly true in the laboratory operating under less than total containment c oncepts and in all areas used for the housing of animals, whether or not they have been intentionally infected. A well -conceived and executed housekeeping program limits physical clutter that could distract the attention and interfere with the activities of laboratory personnel at a critical moment in a potentially hazardous procedure, provides a work area that will not in itself be a source of physical injury or contamination, and provides an area that promotes the efficient use of decontaminates in the e vent of inadvertent release of an etiologic agent. Less immediately evident are the benefits of establishing, among personnel of widely varying levels of education, some concepts of the nature and sources of contamination. 7.8.1 Objectives of Housekeeping The o bjectives of housekeeping in the laboratory are to: Provide an orderly work area conducive to the accomplishment of the research program. Provide work areas devoid of physical hazards. Provide a clean work area with background contamination ideally held to a zero level but more realistically to a level such that extraordinary measures in sterile techniques are not required to maintain integrity of the biological systems under study. Prevent the accumulation of materials from current and past experiments that constitute a hazard to laboratory personnel. Prevent the creation of aerosols of hazardous materials because of the housekeeping procedures used. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 7-6 Procedures developed in the area of housekeeping should be based on the highest level of risk to which the personnel and integrity of the experiments will be subject. Such an approach avoids the confusion of multiple practices and retraining of personnel. The primary function, then, of routine housekeeping procedures is to prevent the accumulation of organic d ebris that may: Harbor microorganisms potentially a threat to the integrity of the biological systems under investigation. Enhance the survival of microorganisms inadvertently released in experimental procedures. Be transferable from one area to another on clothing and shoes. With sufficient buildup, become a biohazard as a consequence of secondary aerosolization by personnel and air movement Cause allergenic sensitization of personnel (e.g., to animal dander). Housekeeping in animal care units has the same primary function as that stated for the laboratory and should, in addition, be as meticulously carried out in quarantine and conditioning areas as in areas used to house experimentally infected animals. No other area in the laboratory has the constant po tential for creation of significant quantities of contaminated organic debris than do animal care facilities. 7.8.2 Scope In all laboratories, efforts to achieve total decontamination and to conduct a major cleanup of the biological materials are normally undertaken at relatively long time intervals. Routine housekeeping must be relied on to provide a work area free of significant sources of background contamination. The provision of such a work area is not simply a matter of indicating in a general way what has to be done, who will do it, and how often. The supervisor must view each task critically in terms of the potential biohazard involved, decide on a detailed procedure for its accomplishment, and provide instructions to laboratory personnel in a man ner that minimizes the opportunity for misunderstanding. The list below outlines a portion of the items requiring critical review by the laboratory supervisor. It is not intended to be complete but is presented as an example of the detailed way housekeeping in the laboratory complex must be viewed. Aisles Eyewashes Lab Entry and Exit Ways Bench Tops Floors Lab Equipment Cleanup Biological Safety Cabinets Glassware Refrigerators Cold Rooms Hallways Supply Storage Deep Freezer Chests Incubators Waste Accumulations Dry Ice Chests Insect and Rodent Control Work Surfaces Instruments 7.8.3 Assignment of Responsibilities Housekeeping in the laboratory is one avenue that leads to safely accomplishing the research program. It is important that housekeeping tasks be assigned to personnel who are knowledgeable of the research environment. The recommended approach to housekeeping is the assignment of housekeeping tasks to the research teams on an individual basis for their immediate work areas and on a cooperative basis for areas of common usage. Similarly, animal caretaker personnel should be responsible for housekeeping in animal care areas. The laboratory supervisor must determine the frequency with which the individual and Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 7-7 cooperative housekeeping chores need be accomplished. The supervisor should provide schedules and perform frequent inspection to assure compliance. Th is approach assures that research work flow patterns will not be interrupted by a contracted cleanup crew; delicate laboratory equipment will be handled only by those most knowledgeable of its particular requirements; and the location of concentrated biological preparations, as well as contaminated equipment used in their preparation and application, will be known. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 8-1 8 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Multidisciplinary research conducted in Yale University laboratories requires that personal protective equipment (protective clothing and safety apparatus/equipment) be used to protect the researcher from contact with infectious, toxic and corrosive agents, excessive heat, cold, fire and other physical hazards. Suitable Pers onal Protective Equipment (PPE) also protects the experiment from contamination. The extent and kind of clothing and equipment to be selected for any particular activity depends upon the research operations and levels of risk associated with the research. While PPE is an important component of any biological safety program, PPE is used with the understanding that PPE serves as a second line of defense. Good laboratory techniques, procedures and appropriate laboratory equipment are the primary barriers against potential exposure to hazardous agents. For additional information you are urged to consult the Biosafety Office. In the event the Biosafety Office does not have a listing of the kind of protective devices you are seeking, efforts will be made to ac quire the information needed. 8.1 Laboratory Clothing A commonly used PPE item within the laboratory is special clothing. Both reusable and disposable clothing is available. Whichever is used, it must be durable, designed to provide protection and prevent exposure of the skin to harmful agents, as well as be compatible with the methods of decontamination employed. Laboratory clothing serves to protect the wearer, the experiment, and environment against contamination. If proper precautions are not taken, co ntaminated clothing may carry infectious materials outside the laboratory and into other work areas, cafeterias, or the home. Infectious agents can remain viable on cotton and wool fabrics and be disseminated from these fabrics. Some additional points: Overt exposure to agents at all level of risk should be followed by immediate decontamination of the PPE and change into clean PPE to protect the worker, the experiments and the environment. Provisions should be made for PPE to be provided to visitors and ma intenance or security personnel, if applicable. PPE worn within the laboratory should not be worn outside the facility to the library, cafeteria, or other places accessible to the public. Personnel should be encouraged to use disposable facial tissues inst ead of personal handkerchiefs. PPE should be placed in an appropriately designated area or container for storage, washing, decontamination or disposal. All PPE should be decontaminated before being sent to the laundry or discarded. Treat contaminated area s of PPE with an appropriate disinfectant. Lab coats with extensive contamination may be placed in a biohazard bag and autoclaved. Do not take PPE home to launder; select a laundry service that follows universal precautions. Change PPE as soon as feasible whenever it is compromised, soiled or torn. Wear appropriate sizes and keep an adequate supply of PPE available in the laboratory. Wash hands whenever PPE is removed. Do not touch door handles, elevator buttons, telephones, computers or other clean surfac es or items with gloved hands. Wear closed -toe shoes and long pants to guard against skin contamination or chemical exposure. Do not wear sandals or shorts in the laboratory. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 8-2 8.1.1 Gloves Gloves should be comfortable and of sufficient length to prevent exposure of the wrist and forearm. Depending upon intended use, the composition and design of the glove may vary to provide the desired level of flexibility, strength, impermeability, and resistance to penetration by sharp objects, as well as protection against h eat and cold. Quality assurance is an important consideration. No glove can be expected to be satisfactory for all intended uses. Gloves may be fabricated of cloth, leather, natural and synthetic rubbers, or plastics. New formulations of synthetic rubbe r and plastic continue to be developed as research makes varied and changing demands on the protective capabilities of gloves. Changing applications lead to improved capabilities of impermeability, strength, flexibility, tactile sense and control. Within even the modest laboratory, the glove applications may be such that no less than four or five types of protective gloves need to be stocked and used. Disposable (single use) gloves provide a barrier between infectious agents and the skin. Glove use is a basic precept of preventing infectious agent transmission. Breaks in the skin barrier of the hand (damaged cuticles, scrapes, micro -cuts, dermatitis, etc.) are common. Gloves shall be removed, and hands washed before exiting the laboratory. If a sample is being transported between labs within buildings the sample must be placed into a rigid, leak proof secondary container with absorbent material in sufficient quantity to absorb the material in the primary container. The outside of the secondary container must be decontaminated so there is no reason to wear a glove when transporting samples . If transporting supplies or equipment between laboratories within buildings, items must be properly decontaminated prior to being brought out of the lab, there is no n eed to wear glove when transporting materials outside the lab. See Section 7.6: Transport of Biohazards on Campus (between labs or buildings) for more information. The Office of En vironmental Health and Safety ( EHS) can provide information on gloves neede d for various tasks, such as working with animals, dry i ce, heat, acids, etc. Consult EHS with details of your work to receive further information about the type and availability of gloves that will best meet your requirements. Considerations for the selection and use of gloves: Gloves are not 100% leakproof; change gloves periodically and when soiled Always wash hands after removing gloves or other PPE. Gloves will not prevent needle sticks or other puncture injuries. Check gloves for visible tears before use. Avoid wetting examination gloves as water or disinfectants will encourage wicking and leaking Do not reuse examination gloves; discard contaminated gloves in a biohazard bag immediately after use. Double glove or use household utility gloves when cleaning spills. Household utility gloves may be decontaminated and reused (replace when compromised.) 8.1.2 Procedure for Removing Gloves Grip the outside of one glove at wrist with the other gloved hand, pull glove off and gather in palm of gloved hand. Plac e index or middle finger of the ungloved hand on wrist of gloved hand, slide finger under the glove opening and pull glove off inside out. When removing PPE, remove lab coat or solid front gown first, then remove gloves (aseptically), remove face protectio n last to avoid touching your face with contaminated hands. If wearing double gloves, remove outer gloves before removing lab coat or solid front gown. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 8-3 8.1.3 Shoes Shoes worn in the laboratory must be closed-toe. Protective shoes are required for certain work activities. When working with infectious agents it is advisable to wear shoe covers, which can be decontaminated (autoclaved) before disposal, over street shoes. For work in tissue culture laboratories it may be necessary to change from street shoes to specific laboratory shoes for protection of cultures from contamination. In certain animal facilities the Yale Animal Resources Center requires personnel to wear overshoes to protect the animals in containment areas. Similarly, people who work with animals and do cage washing are required to wear protective shoes. All personnel working under the Yale Animal Resources Center must follow these and other recommendations of the Yale Animal Resources Center. 8.1.4 Gowns, Lab Coats, Jumpsuits, Aprons and Other Protect ive Clothing Gowns, lab coats and jumpsuits protect the wearer's clothing and skin from contamination. As with all PPE, the type of clothing needed depends on the task being performed and the degree of exposure anticipated. Solid front wrap -around clothing offers better protection than pull -over type clothing or clothing with front closures. Lab coats are not 100% leakproof; change PPE when soiled, and always wash your hands after removing any PPE. Lab coats or other protective clothing will not prevent needle sticks or other punctures. Spills and splashes occur most often in the chest or lap area. The contaminated surface must be touched during removal of a front closing jacket or lab coat. The contaminated portion often ends up in the wearer's face d uring removal of pullover clothing. Many workers prefer not to button up front closing jackets, which leaves street clothing exposed. If front closing jackets must be worn, strict measures shall be implemented to assure the clothing is closed at all times when performing procedures or tasks that may cause exposure. Long sleeved garments with snug fitting cuffs are preferred over open or short sleeves. Snug fitting cuffs prevent splashes, splatters and aerosols from making contact with exposed skin on the lower arms. Longer single -use gloves can be pulled over snug fitting cuffs to seal out any infectious materials. Plastic, vinyl or rubber aprons are usually worn over other protective clothing when extra protection is desired. Aprons are necessary for p rotection against liquids spilling or splashing on clothing. It is recommended that appropriate aprons be worn to protect against the potential harmful effects of liquid waste. Aprons may also be used to provide protection from steam and hot water in locations such as animal handling facilities, autoclave rooms and laboratory glass washing rooms. 8.1.5 Face and Eye Protection Protection of the face and eyes is of prime importance in laboratories due to the potential for foreign material, both liquid and solid, to splash on the head, face and eyes or contact lenses. A variety of face shields, head covers/hoods, protective goggles, and lenses are available from safety supply houses. The selection is dependent upon materials of construction, fit, comfort, and com patibility with the work and the overall facial area requiring protection. Some of the considerations for selection and use of face and eye protection are indicated below: Face shields and hoods protect the face and the neck from flying particles and spray s of hazardous material; however, they do not provide basic eye protection against impacting objects. Shields should cover the entire face, permit tilting back to clean the face if desired, and be easily removed in the event of an accident. If an eye hazard exists in a particular operation or experiment, the soundest safety policy would be to require that eye or face protection, or both, be worn at all times by all persons entering or working in the laboratory. Contact lenses do not provide eye protection. It is recommended that contact lenses not be worn when working around chemicals, fumes, and other hazardous material and dust particles since these Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 8-4 items may become trapped in the space between the contact lens and the cornea. When contact lenses are wo rn, eye protection, such as tight -fitting goggles, must be worn. 8.2 Respiratory Protection Protection of the respiratory system is a major concern of any biological safety program because infectious organisms can readily enter the human body through the respi ratory tract. The possibility of this occurring depends on the type and infectious dose of the organism . For some, as few as one to ten organisms, when inhaled, may cause infection. Particles with an effective aerodynamic diameter of between 0.5 and 5.0 \u00b5 m (the respirable fraction) are most effective at penetration and retention in the deep pulmonary spaces. Particles larger than 5 micrometers are generally trapped in the upper respiratory tract and eventually cleared or swallowed. Engineering controls, such as the use of biological safety cabinets, should be always be considered as a first line of defense against respiratory infection when working with infectious organisms. Respirators should only be considered as a second line of defense after feasible engineering controls have been put into place and additional controls are still needed. Respirators vary in design, application, and protective capability. Respirators can be placed into two categories: Air purifying Supplied air By far, the most commonly used respirators in laboratories are air purifying respirators. These protect by purifying the existing breathing air through a filter (for particulates) or cartridge (for gases and vapors). Standard air purifying respirators at Yale are \u00bd mask, full face, or powered air purifying respirators (PAPR). These rely on the proper cartridge selection to filter out the contaminant. Dust masks that have been approved by NIOSH are also considered to be air purifying respirators. These are ranked by thei r filtering efficiencies and by whether they can be used in an environment containing oil aerosols. Approved dust masks will have one of the following designations - N95, N99, N100, R95, R99, R100, selection of cartridges and respirators is very important and should not be made without input from the Office of Environmental Health and Safety. New regulations concerning respirators require initial and annual training and fit -testing, and well as medical surveillance of all respir ator wearers. Please make sure that the Office of Environmental Health and Safety is notified whenever the use of a respirator is being considered. T he Respirator Administrator in EHS can assist in evaluating the procedure, selecting the proper respirato r, and provide the required training and fit testing. The Employee Health Office must also be notified so that medical surveillance and clearance can be issued prior to wearing the respirator. A copy of Yale University's Respiratory Protection Program is available at https://ehs.yale.edu/respiratory - protection 8.3 Selection of PPE Use the following PPE to minimize exposure via mucous membrane OR non-intact skin: For face protection, wear safety glasses and a mask, or a chin length face shield whenever splashing, splattering or droplets may be anticipated (any work with liquids on the open bench). An impact resistant face shield should be used when operating the autoclave. Impact resistant face shield s will protect the user's face against splatters of hot liquids or broken glass fragments. Gloves and a lab coat are worn to protect the skin and clothing from contact with potentially infectious materials. Wear gloves that are long enough to extend over the sleeves of the lab coat and cover wrists. Consider double gloving when working with cultures of infectious agents or handling spills. Thicker household utility gloves can be worn for cleaning blood or B SL2 spills. Utility gloves can be decontaminated and reused until the integrity of the glove is compromised. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 8-5 Temperature resistant gloves should be worn to protect hands from physical damage when working with very hot (autoclave) or cold (liquid nitrogen tank, -70\u00b0C freezer) materials. Sleeve covers are worn over lab coat and gown sleeves to provide protection to the sleeves and wrists from contamination when working in the biological safety cabinet. Disposable sleeve covers have tight fitting grips at b oth ends. Waterproof bandages are worn to cover any wounds or non-intact skin before gloving. It is preferred to double glove when skin is damaged or non -intact. Inform your supervisor of any severe skin conditions or wounds. Avoid working with BSL2 , BL 3 or other potentially infectious materials if non -intact skin cannot be adequately covered. Solid front gowns provide more protection to clothing and skin than lab coats. Solid front gowns are worn for high hazard infectious agent work. The tight-fittin g cuffs of the gown help to minimize wrist contamination. Impervious lab coats, gowns or aprons are worn when heavy contamination or soiling is likely. Head covers are worn to protect the hair and scalp from splatter or droplets when working with heavy contamination or when contact with the head is likely. When choosing a head cover make sure it is impervious to liquids (some head covers are not impervious). Shoe covers are worn over the shoes to protect shoes from contamination when working in heavily contaminated areas (such as large spills, crime scenes, morgues, cadaver dissection areas, surgical operation areas). Gowns, head and shoe covers also help keep contaminants from entering the sterile area in clean rooms and surgical suites. Use the following PPE to minimize exposure via cuts, slices, or scratches: Kevlar gloves and sleeves are cut resistant and will help guard against slices, scratches or cuts, but will not prevent direct puncture or needlestick injuries. Steel mesh gloves also protect against slices, cuts, and scratches but will not eliminate punctures. Neoprene and other abrasive resistant gloves are cut resistant, but significantly reduce dexterity. Use the following PPE to minimize exposure via aerosols: HEPA filtered respirators (air pur ifying or powered air purifying) are worn to prevent exposure to potentially infectious aerosols when cleaning spills of concentrated infectious material or responding to centrifuge incidents. Employees who wear a respirator must enroll in the Yale Respir atory Protection Program before using a respirator. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 8-6 8.4 PPE Requirements Table PPE Biosafety Level 1 Biosafety Level 2 Biosafety Level 3 Gloves Recommended to prevent skin or clothing contact with BSL1 materials. Note: work that may involve radioactive materials or chemicals will require the use of a lab coat and gloves. Required Required Lab Coat Recommended to prevent skin or clothing contact with BSL1 materials. Note: work that may involve radioactive materials or chemicals will require the use of a lab coat and gloves. Required Solid front protective clothing such as back fastening gown with ti ght fitting cuffs must be worn to protect street clothing and skin from contact with infectious agents. Face Protection Wear protective eyewear and surgical mask or chin length face shield whenever splashing, splattering or spraying is anticipated to pre vent contact with mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth. Researchers may choose to augment eye protection by performing experiments behind a protective splash shield. Face protection is not required when performing all work inside a biological safe ty cabinet. However, if there is a potential for splashing, such as from a dropped container during transport, face protection must be worn. Respiratory Protection The use of respiratory protective equipment such as a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) will be recommended or required by the Yale Biological Safety Committee and/or the Office of En vironmental Health and Safety ( EHS) on a case by case basis. The use of PAPRs is required for response and cleanup of a BL3 spill. All those who may wea r a resp irator must be enrolled in the EHS Respiratory Protection Program. Other Other PPE such as Tyvek coveralls, booties, sleeve guards, plastic aprons, and household rubber gloves will be recommended on a case by case basis. Generally, additional pr otective clothing is required whenever there is a high potential for splashing of potentially infectious material, such as organ harvesting or large spill response and clean up. Other PPE such as Tyvek coveralls, booties, sleeve guards, plastic aprons, and household rubber gloves will be recommended on a case by case basis. Generally, additional protective clothing is required whenever there is a high potential for splashing of potentially infectious material, such as organ harvesting or large spill respon se and clean up. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 9-7 9 Laboratory Equipment 9.1 Biological Safety Cabinets The Office of Environmental Health and Safety has a program that monitors the performance of biological safety cabinets as well as horizontal and vertical laminar flow benches. Additional information on the program is found in the Clean Air Device (Primar y Containment Device) Program Guide . The program conforms to guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Bloodbor ne Pathogens Standard. Biological safety cabinets (BSCs), when used properly, provide a clean work environment for research or patient care activities. Biological safety cabinets offer personnel, product, and environmental protection. The BSC provides pr imary containment for infectious materials. The efficacy of BSCs depends upon the behavior of the operator and the orientation of the unit in the facility. The BSC isolates biohazards from personnel by confining the biohazardous material in the unit. The BSC removes aerosolized biohazardous material by moving air through high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. The intake air is filtered through a HEPA filter before entering the BSC work area. Exhaust air also passes through a HEPA filter. Aerosols generated in the work area of the BSC are contained within the BSC. Operating Procedures for Class II Biological Safety Cabinet: If used, turn off UV light; turn on fluorescent light and blower. Disinfect all interior surfaces with 70% ethanol , 1-10% b leach or other suitable disinfectant. Place items required for procedure into cabinet; do not obstruct grills. Wait 2 -3 minutes for contaminants to purge from work area. Keep materials at least 4 inches inside work area. Work should proceed from clean to c ontaminated areas. After procedure, allow cabinet to run 2 -3 minutes before removing materials. Wipe down all work surfaces with 70% ethanol , 1-10% bleach or suitable disinfectant. Turn off fluorescent light and blower if desired. Many BSCs are equipped wi th germicidal ultraviolet (UV) lamps. Time of exposure, distance, presence of dust or debris and UV lamp intensity affect the germicidal effect of the UV lamp. The visible blue-violet glow of the UV lamp does not indicate there is germicidal effect. The UV lamp needs to be cleaned periodically to remove dust. UV lamps may damage eyes, skin, and laboratory equipment. UV lamps should be turned off while the room is occupied. EHS discourages the use of UV lamps due to the potential damage resulting from UV lamp use. 9.2 Procedures for Centrifugation All centrifugation shall be done using centrifuge safety buckets or sealed centrifuge tubes in sealed rotors. If a small centrifuge is used and centrifuge safety cups are not available, the centrifuge should be operated in the biological safety cabinet. Each person operating a centrifuge should be trained on proper operating procedures. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 9-8 Keep a log book detailing operation records for centrifuges and rotors to assist in determining service requirements. The follow ing procedures for centrifugation are recommended: Examine tubes and bottles for cracks or stress marks before using them. Fill and decant all centrifuge tubes and bottles within the biological safety cabinet. Wipe outside of tubes with disinfectant befor e placing in safety cups or rotors. Never overfill centrifuge tubes as leakage may occur when tubes are filled to capacity. The maximum for centrifuge tubes is 3/4 full. Always cap tubes before spinning. Place all tubes in safety buckets or sealed rotors. Inspect the \"O\" ring seal of the safety bucket and the inside of safety buckets or rotors. Correct rough walls caused by erosion or adhering of matter and remove debris from the rubber cushions. Wipe exterior of tubes or bottles with disinfectant prior to loading into rotor or safety bucket. Never exceed safe rotor speed. Stop the centrifuge immediately if an unusual condition (noise or vibration) begins. Wait five minutes after the run before opening the centrifuge. This will allow aerosols to settle in the event of a breakdown in containment. Decontaminate safety carriers or rotors and centrifuge interior after each use. Open safety buckets or rotors in a biological safety cabinet. If the rotor does not fit in the biological safety cabinet, use the fum e hood. If construction of the centrifuge permits, the centrifuge chamber is to be connected to a vacuum pump with a HEPA filter installed between the centrifuge and the vacuum pump. 9.3 Vacuum Line Chemical Traps and Filters Vacuum line chemical traps and fil ters prevent suction of infectious and non -infectious materials into the vacuum lines. T he setup of chemical traps and filter systems are reprinted from the Laboratory Safety Monograph below. Contact the Biosafety Office for information regarding vacuum line filters. Considerations and Limitations of Vacuum Line Chemical Traps and Filters: Add full strength chemical disinfectant to chemical trap flasks. Allow the aspirated fluids to complete the dilution. For example: Start with 100 -ml household chlorine bleach, aspirat e 900- ml fluids and discard. Vacuum line filters shall be examined and replaced if clogged or if liquid makes contact with the filter. Used filters shall be discarded in the medical waste stream. The figure below (Figure 12) describing the proper set up of a vacuum aspiration system, including placement of traps and a filter, is copied from the CDC/NIH Biosafety in Microbiological Laboratories, 5 th Edition, 2009. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 9-9 9.4 Syringes and Needles The hypodermic needle is a dangerous instrument. To lessen the chance of accidental injection, aerosol generation, or spills, the use of syringes should be avoided when alternate methods are available. For example, use a blunt needle or cannula on the syringe for oral or intranasal inoculations and never use a syringe and needle as a substitute for a pipette in making dilutions. The following practices are recommended for hypodermic needles and syringes when used for parenteral injections: Use the syringe and needle in a biological safety cabinet only and avoid quick and unnecessary movements of the hand holding the syringe. Examine glass syringes for chips and cracks, and needles for barbs and plugs. This should be done prior to sterilization before use. Use needle-locking syringes only and be sure that the needle is locked securely into the barrel. Replace glass syringes with plastic disposable syringes whenever possible. Whenever possible use safer needle systems. Wear latex gloves for all manipulations with needles and syringes. Fill the syringe caref ully to minimize air bubbles and frothing of the inoculum. Expel excess air, liquid and bubbles from a syring e vertically into a cotton pad moistened with an appropriate disinfectant, or into a small bottle of sterile cotton. Do not use the syringe to forc efully expel a stream of infectious fluid into an open vial for the purpose of mixing. Mixing with a syringe is condoned only if the tip of the syringe is held below the surface of the fluid in the tube. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 9-10 If syringes are filled from test tubes, take care n ot to contaminate the hub of the needle, as this may result in the transfer of infectious material to the fingers. When removing a syringe and needle from a rubber -stoppered bottle, wrap the needle and stopper in a cotton pad moistened with an appropriate disinfectant. If there is concern of the disinfectant contaminating sensitive experimental materials, a sterile pad may be used and immediately discarded into a biohazard bag. When inoculating animals, position the hand that is holding the animal \"behind\" the needle or use a pair of forceps to hold the animal in order to avoid puncture wounds. Be sure the animal is properly restrained prior to the inoculation and be on the alert for any unexpected movements of the animal. Before and after injection of an animal, swab the injection site with an appropriate antiseptic. Discard syringes into a needle box . DO NOT bend, shear, recap or otherwise manipulate the needle. If reca pping is unavoidable, use a one -handed method. DO NOT discard syringes into a red buc ket, biohazard bag, or box-bag unit . 9.5 Pipettes The following is excerpted from Laboratory Safety, Principles and Practices 2nd Ed., ASM Press. Never suction or pipette by mouth; always use some type of pipetting aid when pipetting infectious materials. Pre ferably, all activities should be confined to a biosafety cabinet. Mouth pipetting should be prohibited even with mouth pipetting devices that use an hydrophobic membrane filter that does not require fingers to touch the mouthpiece. This reusable pipetting device requires storage on the bench or other location between usage, which can result in contamination on the end piece that inserts into the mouth. Pipetting of toxic chemicals should be performed in a chemical fume hood. Infectious or toxic m aterials should never be forcefully expelled from a pipette. Mark -to-mark pipettes are preferable to other types because they do not require expulsion of the last drop. Infectious or toxic fluids should never be mixed by bubbling air from a pipette through the fluid. Infectious or toxic fluids should never be mixed by alternate suction and expulsion through a pipette. Discharge from a pipette should be as close as possible to the fluid or agar level, and the contents should be allowed to run down the wall of the tube or bottle whenever possible, not dropped from a height. Pipettes used for transferring infectious or toxic materials should always be plugged with cotton, even when safety pipetting aids are used. Avoid accidentally dropping infectious or toxic material from the pipette onto the work surface. Place a disinfectant dampened towel or other absorbent material on the work surface, and autoclave before discard or reuse. Plastic backed bench paper is suitable for this purpose. Contaminated pipettes should be placed horizontally into a pan or tray containing enough suitable disinfectant, such as hypochlorite, to allow complete immersion of the pipettes. Pipettes should not be placed vertically in a cylinder that, because of its height, must be placed on the floor outside the biosafety cabinet. Removing contaminated pipettes from the biosafety cabinet and placing them vertically in a cylinder provides opportunity for dripping from the pipette onto the floor, or the rim of the cylinder, thereby creating an aerosol, and the top of the pipettes often protrude above the level of disinfectant. Place discard pans for used pipettes within the biosafety cabinet. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 9-11 After suitable contact time, excess disinfectant can be carefully poured down the sink. The pan and pipettes can be autoclaved together and replaced by a clean pan with fresh disinfectant. 9.6 Blenders, Mixers, Sonicators, and Cell Disruption Equipment Hazardous aerosols are created by most laboratory operations involving blending, mixing, stirring, grinding or disrupting biohazardous materials. Even the use of a mortar and pestle can be a hazardous operation. Other devices that may produce aerosols are ball mills, colloid mills, jet mills, tissue grinders, magnetic mixers, stirrers, sonic cleaning devices, ultrasonic cell disintegrators, and shakers. Adequate decontamination is essential prior to sonic cleaning due to possible aerosol generation. Wherever sonicators are used in the cleaning process; such as in dishwashers, animal cage washers, etc.; all i tems should be sterilized prior to cleaning. The laboratory practices generally required when using equipment that may generate aerosols with biohazardous materials are as follows: Operate blending, cell disruption, and grinding equipment in a biological s afety cabinet; Use safety blenders designed to prevent leakage from the rotor bearing at the bottom of the bowl. In the absence of a leakproof rotor, inspect the rotor for leakage prior to operation. A preliminary test run with sterile water, saline, or methylene blue solution is recommended prior to use; If the blender is used with infectious material place a towel moistened with an appropriate disinfectant over the top of the blender. Sterilize the device and residual contents promptly after use; Glass blender bowls are undesirable for use with infectious material because of the potential for glass bowls to break; Blender bowls sometimes require supplemental cooling to prevent destruction of the bearings and to minimize thermal effects on the product; Before opening the safety blender bowl, permit the blender to rest for at least one minute to allow settling of the aerosol cloud; Grinding of infected tissues or materials with any open device is best done within a biological safety cabinet. 9.7 Lyophilizing Specimens shell -frozen in ampoules are dried on a vacuum manifold or in a chamber -type drier at low negative pressure. If the glass neck of the ampoule is sealed off while the ampoule is still under vacuum, it may cause implosion, either during the sealing or later when the evacuated ampoule is being opened. To avoid this, after drying is completed, and before sealing is done, bring the pressure within the ampoule back to normal by gradually introducing dry nitrogen, avoiding turbulent disturbance of the d ry product. The narrow or constricted neck of the ampoule is contaminated if the specimen is allowed to run down the wall of the neck during filling. Subsequently, when the ampoule is sealed with a torch, the dried material on the wall becomes charred or partially decomposed; residues of this material may adversely affect the dried material when it is reconstituted. To avoid this, a syringe with a long cannula or a Pasteur -type pipette should be used to fill the vial. Do not allow the delivery end of the cannula or pipette to touch the neck of the vial. All ampoules used for freeze -drying of cultures, toxins, or other biohazardous material should be fabricated of Pyrex -type glass. This type of glass requires a high -temperature torch using an air -gas or o xygen -gas mixture for sealing. These hard glass ampoules are much less apt to form gas bubbles that burst inwardly during sealing under vacuum than the soft glass ampoules and are more resistant to breakage during handling and storage. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 9-12 The filling of ampoules and vials with infectious specimens, the subsequent freeze -drying, and sealing or closing of ampoules and vials in the preparation of dry infectious specimens should be performed in a biological safety cabinet. The same is true for the preparation of ampoules and vials containing liquid specimens not subject to freeze -drying. Safety precautions to be taken will depend on the agents, equipment, and containment available. Therefore, before initiating this procedure, the Principal Investigator should work out the protocol for each machine in consultation with the Biological Safety Officer. All persons using the procedure must then follow the protocol. 9.8 Microtome/Cryostat Due to the very sharp blade and the nature of the materials used with the microtome/cryostat, training is essential in the use of the equipment and in the hazards of the materials used with the equipment. Users should be informed of the need to prevent cuts and scrapes as well as protect the eyes, nose, mouth and skin from exposure to the materials being used. New personnel must be trained in the proper use and maintenance of the equipment and demonstrate proficiency prior to use. If using human tissue, microtome/cryostat users are required to attend Bloodborne Pathogens training. Fixatives take time to penetrate tissue; the fixatives may not inactivate pathogens deep in the tissue. Freezing and drying do not inactivate most pathogens, so, as with fixative use, the pathogens that may be present in the tissue should be considered capable of causing infection. Microtome/cryostat users shall also attend Chemical Safety Laboratory Personnel training due to the fixatives and dyes used in histology. When purchasing new units, the available safety features should be taken into consider ation prior to deciding on a manufacturer or model. Some available safety features are: Auto -decontamination cycle. Easy blade release for installing and changing blades. Retractable knife/blade to permit safe entry into chamber for cleaning, retrieving specimens, etc. Disposable blades. Never retrieve samples, change blades, or clean equipment by hand with the blade in place; always use appropriate engineering controls (i.e. forceps, tweezers, dissecting probes, and small brushes). Thing to remember when using and maintaining microtomes/cryostats: Always keep hands away from blades. Use extreme caution when aligning blocks, the blocks may be close to the blades. If available, make sure block holder is in locked position when loading/aligning blocks. Use k nife-edge protectors/guards. Do not leave knife -edges that may extend beyond microtome knife holder unprotected. Keep blocks wet when in the microtome to minimize airborne shavings during slicing. Use brushes to clean/brush equipment. Use engineering cont rols such as forceps when removing or changing the blade. Dislodge stuck blocks using mechanical means such as forceps and/or dissecting probes. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 9-13 Wear appropriate PPE such as a lab coat or gown, mask, safety glasses or goggles, surgical grade Kevlar gloves that provide dexterity and cut protection, and examination gloves to protect against biohazards. When changing blades, wear stainless steel mesh gloves to protect against cuts and scrapes. Avoid freezing propellants that are under pressure as they may cause splattering or droplets of infectious materials. Decontaminate equipment on a regular schedule using an appropriate disinfectant. Consider trimmings and sections of tissue as contaminated and discard appropriately . Do not move or transport microtome with knife in position. Do not leave knives out of containers when not in use. Do not leave motorized microtomes running unattended. 9.9 Miscellaneous Equipment (Waterbaths, Cold Storage, Shakers) Water baths and Warburg baths used to inactivate, incubate, or test infectious substances should contain a disinfectant. For cold water baths, 70% propylene glycol is recommended. Sodium azide should not be used as a bacteriostatic. It creates a serious explosion hazard. Deep freeze, liquid nitrogen, and dry ice chests as well as refrigerators should be checked, cleaned out periodically to remove any broken ampoules, tubes, etc. containing infectious material, and decontaminated. Use rubber gloves and respiratory protection during this cleaning. All infectious or toxi c material stored in refrigerators or deep freezers should be properly labeled. Security measures should be commensurate with the hazards. The degree of hazard represented by contaminated liquid nitrogen reservoirs will be largely dependent upon the infectious potential of the stored microorganisms, their stability in liquid nitrogen, and their ability to survive in the airborne state. Investigations suggest that storing tissue culture cell lines in containers other than sealed glass ampoules might result in potential inter -contamination among cell lines stored in a common liquid nitrogen repository. Care must be exercised in the use of membrane filters to obtain sterile filtrates of infectious materials. Because of the fragility of the membrane and other factors, such filtrates cannot be handled as non - infectious until culture or other tests have proved their sterility. Shaking machines should be examined carefully for potential breakage of flasks or other containers being shaken. Screw-capped durable pl astic or heavy walled glass flasks should be used. These should be securely fastened to the shaker platform. An additional precaution would be to enclose the flask in a plastic bag with or without an absorbent material. No person should work alone on an extremely hazardous operation. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 10-1 10 Decontamination and Disposal Procedures 10.1 Decontamination Methods Physical and chemical means of decontamination fall into three main categories: heat, liquid decontaminants, and vapors and gases. 10.1.1 Heat The application of heat, either moist or dry, is recommended as the most effective method of sterilization. Steam at 121\u00b0C under pressure in the autoclave is the most convenient method of rapidly ac hieving sterility under ordinary circumstances. Dry heat at 160\u00b0C to 170\u00b0C for periods of two to four hours is suitable for destruction of viable agents on an impermeable non-organic material such as glass but is not reliable in even shallow layers of org anic or inorganic material that can act as insulation. Incineration is another use of heat for decontamination. Incineration serves as an efficient means of disposal for human and animal pathological wastes. The hazards of handling hot solids and liquids are reasonably familiar. Laboratory personnel should be cautioned that steam under pressure could be a source of scalding jets if the equipment is misused. Loads of manageable size should be used. Fluids treated by steam under pressure may be superheat ed if removed from the sterilizer too soon after treatment. This may cause a sudden and violent boiling of contents from the containers that can splash scalding liquids onto personnel handling the containers. See the autoclave safety poster in the Poster Section of this manual. 10.1.2 Liquid Decontaminants In general, the liquid decontaminants find their most practical use in surface decontamination and, at sufficient concentration, as decontaminants of liquid wastes for final disposal in sanitary sewer systems. There are many misconceptions concerning the use of liquid decontaminants. This is due largely to a characteristic capacity of such liquids to perform dramatically in the test tube and to fail miserably in a practical situation. Such failures often occu r because proper consideration was not given to such factors as temperature, contact time, pH, the presence and state of dispersion, penetrability and reactivity of organic material at the site of application. Small variations in the above factors may mak e large differences in the effectiveness of decontamination. For this reason, even when used under highly favorable conditions, complete reliance should not be placed on liquid decontaminants when the end result must be sterility. There are many liquid dec ontaminants available under a wide variety of trade names. In general, these can be categorize d as halogens, acids and alkali s, heavy metal salts, quaternary ammonium compounds, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, the more a ctive the decontaminant the more likely it will possess undesirable characteristics such as corrosivity. None is equally useful or effective under all conditions for all infectious agents. Particular care should be observed when handling concentrated stoc k solutions of disinfectants. Personnel assigned to the task of making up use -concentrations from stock solutions must be informed of the potential hazards and trained in the safe procedures to follow and appropriate personal protective equipment to use as well as the toxicity associated with ocular, skin and respiratory exposure. 10.1.3 Vapors and Gases A variety of vapors and gases possess decontamination properties. The most useful of these are formaldehyde and ethylene oxide. When these can be employed in a closed system and under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity, excellent decontamination can result. Vapor and gas decontaminants are primarily useful in decontaminating biological safety cabinets and associated air - handling systems and air f ilters; bulky or stationary equipment that resists penetration by liquid surface Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 10-2 decontaminants; instruments and optics that may be damaged by other decontamination methods; and rooms, buildings and associated air -handling systems. Avoid inhalation of vapors of formaldehyde and ethylene oxide. Stock containers of these products should be capable of confining these vapors and should be kept in properly ventilated chemical storage areas. In preparing use -dilutions and when applying them, personnel should control the operations to prevent exposure of others and wear respiratory protection as necessary. Mutagenic potential has been attributed to ethylene oxide; toxic and hypersensitivity effects are well -documented for formaldehyde. An outside contractor per forms formaldehyde decontaminations to minimize potential exposure to Yale University employees. Ethylene oxide use is very limited and is generally used in surgical and clinical areas. Use of formaldehyde and ethylene oxi de is monitored closely by the EH S. Please contact the OHS (785 - 3550) for information regarding the exposure monitoring program. 10.2 Autoclave Procedure Moist heat causes the denaturation of proteins at lower temperatures and shorter times than dry heat. One of the most effective physical d econtamination controls is steam sterilization (autoclave) which generates moisture and high temperature pressurized steam within a sealed chamber. Autoclaves can sterilize all items that are heat stable. In gravity autoclaves, a cycle of 250 \u00b0F (121\u00b0 C) at 15 to 18 pounds per square inch (psi) of pressure for one hour may be required for decontamination. In the newer vacuum autoclaves, decontamination may require a cycle of 270\u00b0 F (132 \u00b0C) at 27 to 30 psi for 45 minutes. A biological indicator should be use d to verify proper autoclave operation. The Biosafety Office has indicators available for laboratory use; for more information contact the Biosafety Office at 785 -3550. Personal protection equipment (PPE) such as rubberized aprons, full -face shields and h eat and liquid resistant gloves must be worn when operating autoclaves. Position items in the autoclave to allow steam penetration into all items to be decontaminated. Materials in tightly sealed or stoppered containers may not be effectively decontaminat ed and may become dangerously pressurized causing injury when removed from the autoclave. Items containing chemicals such as phenol or chloroform should not be placed in an autoclave. See the autoclave safety poster in the Poster Section of this manual. 10.3 Characteristics of Chemical Decontaminants Chemicals with decontaminant properties are, for the most part, available as powders, crystals, or liquid concentrates. These may be added to water for application as surface decontaminants, and some, when added in sufficient quantity, find use as decontaminants of bulk liquid wastes. Chemical decontaminants that are gaseous at room temperature are useful as space-penetrating decontaminants. Others become gases at elevated temperatures and can act as either aqueou s surface or gaseous space-penetrating decontaminants. Inactivation of microorganisms by chemical decontaminants may occur in one or more of the following ways: Coagulation and denaturation of protein, or Lysis, or Binding to enzymes or inactivation of an essential enzyme by oxidation, binding, or destruction of enzyme substrate. The relative resistance to the action of chemical decontaminants may be altered substantially by such factors as: concentration of active ingredient, duration of contact, pH, tempe rature, humidity, and presence of extrinsic organic matter. Depending on how these factors are manipulated, the degree of success achieved with chemical decontaminants may range from minimal inactivation of target microorganisms to an Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 10-3 indicated sterility within the limits of sensitivity of the assay system employed. Ineffectiveness of a decontaminant is due primarily to the failure of the decontaminant to contact the microorganisms rather than failure of the decontaminant to act. If an item is placed in a liquid decontaminant, tiny bubbles are visible on the surface of the item. The area under the bubbles is dry and microorganisms in these dry areas will not be affected by the decontaminant. If there are spots of grease, rust or dirt on the item, microo rganisms under these protective coatings will not be contacted by the decontaminant. Scrubbing an item when immersed in a decontaminant is helpful. A decontaminant should have, and most do have, incorporated surface- active agents. 10.3.1 Properties of Some Comm on Decontaminants Alcohol Ethyl or isopropyl alcohol in a concentration of 70- 85% by weight is often used; however, both lose effectiveness at concentrations below 50% and above 90%. Alcohols denature proteins and are somewhat slow in germicidal action. However, alcohols are effective decontaminants against lipid -containing viruses. A contact time of ten minutes is generally employed in efficacy tests with disinfectants. Due to the high evaporation rate of alcohols, repeated applications may be required to achieve the required ten -minute contact time for decontamination. Because of this, the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard does not recognize alcohol as an effective decontaminant for surfaces. Isopropyl alcohol is generally more effective against vegetative bacter ia; ethyl alcohol is a more viricidal agent. Formaldehyde Formaldehyde for use as a decontaminant is usually marketed as a solution of about 37% concentration referred to as formalin, or as a solid polymerized compound called paraformaldehyde. Formaldehyde in a concentration of 5% active ingredient is an effective liquid decontaminant. It loses considerable activity at refrigeration temperatures, and the pungent, irritating odors make formaldehyde solutions difficult to use in the laboratory. Formaldehyde vapor generated from solution is an effective space decontaminant for buildings or rooms, but in the vapor state in the presence of water tends to polymerize on surfaces to form paraformaldehyde, which is persistent and unpleasant. Heating paraformaldehyde to depolymerize it can liberate formaldehyde gas. In the absence of high moisture content in the air, formaldehyde released in the gaseous state forms less polymerized residues on surfaces and less time is required to clear treated areas of fumes than is the case in the vapor state. Phenols Phenol itself is not often used as a decontaminant. The odor is somewhat unpleasant and a sticky, gummy residue remains on treated surfaces. This is especially true during steam sterilization. Althou gh phenol itself may not be in widespread use, phenol homologs and phenolic compounds are basic to a number of popular decontaminants. Phenolic compounds are effective decontaminants against some viruses, fungi, and vegetative bacteria, including rickettsiae. Phenolics are not effective in ordinary use against bacterial spores. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds or Quats After 40 years of testing and use, there is still considerable controversy about the efficacy of the Quats as decontaminants. These cationic detergents are strongly surface-active and are effective against lipid - containing viruses. The Quats will attach to protein so that dilute solutions will quickly loose effectiveness in the presence of proteins. Quats tend to clump microorganisms and are neutralized by anionic detergents such as soap. They have the advantages of being nontoxic, odorless, stable, non -staining, non-corrosive to metals, and inexpensive. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 10-4 Chlorine This halogen is a universal decontaminant active against many microorganisms, including bacterial spores. Chlorine combines with protein and rapidly decreases in concentration in the presence of protein. Free available chlorine is the active element. It is a strong oxidizing agent and corrosive to metals. Chlorine solutions must be prepared frequently. Sodium hypochlorite is usually used as a base for chlorine decontaminants. An excellent decontaminant can be prepared from household or laundry bleach. These bleaches usually contain 5.25%, or 52,500 ppm, available chlorine. If diluted 1 to 100, the resulting solution will contain 525 ppm of available chlorine, and, if a nonionic detergent is added in a concentration of about 0.7%, a very good decontaminant is created. Iodine The characteristics of chlorine and iodine are similar. One of the most popular groups of decontaminants for laboratory use are the iodophors, with Wescodyne being perhaps the most widely used. The range of dilution of Wescodyne recommended by the manufacturer is 1 oz. in 5 gal. of water (25 ppm available iodine) to 3 oz. in 5 gal. of water (75 ppm available iodine). The small amount of free iodine available in this range can rapidly be taken up by extraneous protein that may be present. Clean surfaces or clear water can be effectively treated with 75 -ppm available iodine, but difficulties may be experienced if any appreciable amount of protein is present. For iodophors such as Wescodyne, it is critical that the manufacturer's written instructions are followed. Higher concentrations of iodophores are less effective, as the iodine is bound to itself or the carrier molecule. For use as a sporicide, it is recommended that Wescodyne be diluted 1 to 10 in 50% ethyl alcohol (a reasonably good decontaminant itself.) This will give 1,600 ppm of available iodine , at which concentration relatively rapid inactivation of all microorganisms will occur. 10.3.2 Selecting Chemical Disinfectants No single chemical disinfectant or method will be effective or practical for all situations in which decontamination is required. Sel ection of chemical disinfectants and procedures must be preceded by practical consideration of the purposes for the decontamination and the interacting factors that will ultimately determine how that purpose is to be achieved. Selection of any given proce dure will be influenced by the information derived from answers to the following questions: What is the target organism(s)? What disinfectants, in what form, are known to, or can be expected to, inactivate the target organism(s)? What degree of inactivatio n is required? In what menstruum is the organism suspended (i.e. simple or complex, on solid or porous surface, and/or airborne)? What is the highest concentration of organisms anticipated to be encountered? Can the disinfectant, either as a liquid, vapor, or gas, be expected to contact the organism and can effective duration of contact be maintained? What restrictions apply with respect to compatibility of materials? What is the stability of the disinfectant in use concentrations, and does the anticipated use situation require immediate availability of the disinfectant or will sufficient time be available for preparation of the working concentration shortly before its anticipated use? The primary target of decontamination in the laboratory is the organism(s ) under investigation. Laboratory preparations or cultures usually have titers in excess of those normally observed in nature. Inactivation of these materials presents other problems since agar, proteinaceous nutrients, and cellular materials can Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 10-5 effecti vely retard or chemically bind the active moieties of chemical disinfectants. Such interference with the desired action of disinfectants may require higher concentrations and longer contact times than those shown to be effective in the test tube. Similar ly, a major portion of the contact time required to achieve a given level of agent inactivation may be expended in inactivating a relatively small number of the more resistant members of the population. The current state of the art provides little informa tion with which to predict the probable virulence of these more resistant cells. These problems are, however, common to all potentially pathogenic agents and must always be considered in selecting disinfectants and procedures for their use. Organisms exhi bit a range of resistance to chemical disinfectants. In terms of practical decontamination, most vegetative bacteria, fungi, and lipid -containing viruses are relatively susceptible to chemical disinfection. The non-lipid -containing viruses and bacteria with a waxy coating, such as tubercule bacillus, occupy a mid -range of resistance. Spore forms and unconventional (slow) viruses are the most resistant. A disinfectant selected on the basis of its effectiveness against organisms on any range of the resistance scale will be effective against organisms lower on the scale. Therefore, if disinfectants that effectively control spore forms are selected for routine laboratory decontamination, it can be assumed that any other organism generated by laboratory opera tions, even in higher concentrations, would also be inactivated. Pertinent characteristics and potential applications for several categories of chemical disinfectants most likely to be used in the biological laboratory are summarized in the table on the following pages. Practical concentrations and contact times that may differ markedly from the recommendations of manufacturers of proprietary products are suggested. It has been assumed that microorganisms will be afforded a high degree of potential protec tion by organic menstruums. It has not been assumed that a sterile state will result from application of the indicated concentrations and contact times. It should be emphasized that these data are only indicative of efficacy under artificial test conditi ons. Individual investigators should conclusively determine the efficacy of any of the disinfectants. It is readily evident that each of the disinfectants has a range of advantages and disadvantages as well as a range of potential for inactivation of a d iverse microflora. Equally evident is the need for compromise as an alternative to maintaining a veritable \"drug store\" of disinfectants.

Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 11-1 11 Spill Response This section outlines the basic procedures for dealing with some of the biological spills that you may encounter in your research laboratory. All lab personnel should refer to the relevant spill response procedures before initiating their experiments. 11.1 Composition of a Basic Spill Kit Microbiological and biomedical research laboratories should prepare and maintain a biological spill kit. A spill kit is an essential safety item for labs working with microbiological agents classified at Biosafety Level 2 or higher and f or groups working with large volumes ( > 1 liter) of Biosafety Level 1 material. The following items should be included in the spill kit: Concentrated household bleach A spray bottle for making 10% bleach solutions Forceps, autoclavable broom and dust pan, or other mechanical device for handling sharps Paper towels or other suitable absorbent Biohazard bags for the collection of contaminated spill clean -up items Utility gloves and medical examination gloves Face protection (eye wear and mask, or full -face shield) Additional personal protective equipment (PPE), such as Tyvek jump suits and powered air -purifying respirators (PAPR's), may be required for response to spills in Biosafety Level 3 laboratories. Household bleach is recommended as a standard disinfectant in this guide. Other disinfectants may be used provided the disinfectant is effective against the agents in use at the appropriate dilutions and contact time. For spills involving human materials, including human cell lines, use bleach or a disinfectant registered with the Environmental Protection Agency as tuberculocidal to comply with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. If you have any questions regarding biological spill response procedures or decontamination, representatives from the EHS Occupational Health and Safety section are available by calling 785 - 3550. All spills in a BL3 laboratory shall be reported to EHS immediately. 11.2 Exposure Incident Report exposure immediately; you may need immediate therapy. Needlesticks/puncture wounds: Wash the affected area with antiseptic soap and warm water for 15 minutes Mucous membrane exposure: Flush the affected area for 15 minutes using an eyewash. For all exposure incidents: Notify Principal Investigat or, manager or supervisor (if available) to initiate accident or exposure incident report. Seek medical assistance immediately (within 1 -2 hours) from Yale Health, Acute Care (432 -0123). Medical Area employees may also go to the Yale-New Haven Hospital Em ergency Room (688- 2222). All employees should receive follow up care through Yale Employee Health (432 -7978) Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 11-2 11.3 Biosafety Level 1 (BSL1) Spill Notify others in the area, to prevent contamination of additional personnel and environment. Remove any contaminated PPE and clothing and wash exposed skin with soap and water. Clean -up of BL1 Spill Wearing gloves, lab coat, and face protection, cover spill with paper towels, pour concentrated disinfectant around the spill working from the edge of the spill towards the center. Allow suitable contact time, at least 15 min. Pick up any pieces of broken glass with forceps and place in a sharps container. Discard all disposable materials used to clean up the spill into a biohazard bag. Wash hands with soap and water. 11.4 Biosafety Level 2 (BSL2) Spill Avoid inhaling aerosols and leave the room; notify others to leave as well. Close door, post a sign on the laboratory door indicating there is a biohazard spill, do not enter, and the time of the spill. Remove contaminated P PE, turning exposed areas inward, and place in a biohazard bag. Wash all exposed skin with soap and water. Inform Supervisor, and, if assistance is needed, call the Biosafety Office at 785 -3550. Reporting of Spills Involving rDNA Materials Spills or accide nts in BSL2 laboratories involving recombinant DNA materials resulting in an overt exposure must be immediately reported to EHS, who will assist in reporting the incident to the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA) as required under the NIH Guideli nes for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acids (NIH Guidelines). Clean -up of BSL2 Spill Allow aerosols to disperse for at least 30 minutes before reentering the laboratory. Assemble clean - up materials (disinfectant, paper towels, biohazard bags, and forceps). Put on PPE (lab coat, face protection which can consist of a full -face shield or surgical mask and safety glasses, gloves, utility gloves, and booties if necessary). Depending on the nature of the spill, it may be advisable to wear a HEPA filtered respirator instead of a surgical mask. Only personnel that have completed Respirator Protection Training and are medically cleared may wear HEPA respirators. Cover the area with disinfectant -soaked towels, and then carefully pour disinfect ant around the spill working from the edge of the spill towards the center. Avoid enlarging the contaminated area. Use more concentrated disinfectant as it is diluted by the spill. Allow at least a 20-minute contact time. Pick up the paper towels and an y sharps with forceps or tongs and discard into the appropriate biomedical waste container. Always use mechanical means to pick up the spill cleanup material since there may be sharps under the paper towels. The paper towels are placed over the sharps to decontaminate the sharps prior to removal. Smaller pieces of glass may be collected with cotton or paper towels held with forceps. If no sharps were involved in the spill discard the materials into an autoclave bag. Wipe surrounding areas (where the spil l may have splashed) with disinfectant. Spray the area with 10% household bleach solution and allow to air dry (or wipe down with disinfectant -soaked towels after a 15 -minute contact time). Place all contaminated paper towels and any contaminated protecti ve clothing into a biohazard bag and autoclave. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 11-3 Wash hands and exposed skin areas with soap and water. 11.5 Blood Spills For blood or other material with a high organic content and low concentration of infectious microorganisms: Wear gloves, eye protection, and a lab coat. Absorb blood with paper towels and place in a biohazard bag. Collect any sharp objects with forceps or other mechanical device and place in a sharps container. Using a detergent solution, clean the spill site of all visible blood. Spray the spill site with 10% household bleach and allow to air dry for 15 minutes. After the 15-minute contact time, wipe the area down with disinfectant -soaked paper towels. Discard all disposable materials used to decontaminate the spill and any contaminated PPE into a biohazard bag. Wash your hands with soap and water. 11.6 Spill in a Biological Safety Cabinet Leave the biological safety cabinet blower on and begin cleanup immediately. While wearing PPE (gloves and lab coat or gown) cover the spill area with paper tow els or disinfectant soaked paper towels. Do not place your head into the biosafety cabinet to clean the spill, keep your face behind the viewscreen. If necessary, apply disinfectant to the drain pans and catch basins below the work surface. Be sure the d rain valve is closed before disinfecting the area under the work surface. Wipe cabinet walls, work surfaces, and inside the viewscreen with disinfectant. Lift the front exhaust grill and work surface; wipe all surfaces with disinfectant. Be sure no paper towels or soiled debris are drawn into the area under the spill tray If the drain pans and catch basins under the work surface have had disinfectant applied to them, absorb the disinfectant using paper towels or lab matting. If necessary, place a container under the drain valve and drain the disinfectant under the work surface into the container. Wipe the areas under the work surface to remove residual disinfectant. If bleach was used, follow by wiping with 70% ethanol to remove any corrosive residues. Wash hands and exposed skin with soap and water. Autoclave all cleanup materials and disposable PPE. Notify your PI or supervisor. If the blower/motor of the biosafety cabinet is below the work surface and the spill overflows the drain pan/catch basin under the work surface notify Occupational Health and Safety. A more extensive decontamination of the biological safety cabinet may be required. 11.7 Centrifuge Spill Always use sealed safety buckets or sealed rotors with O-rings. Examine O -ring and replace if worn, cracking or missing. Check tubes and bottles for cracks and deformities before each use. Wait five minutes before opening the centrifuge following the end of a run with potentially hazardous biological material. If a spill is identified after the centrifuge lid is opened, carefully close the lid, evacuate the laboratory, and close the laboratory door. Remain out of the laboratory Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 11-4 for at least 30 minutes. Post a sign on the laboratory door indicating there is a biohazard spill, do not enter, and the tim e of the spill. Remove any contaminated PPE and place into a biohazard bag. Wash hands and any exposed skin surfaces with soap and water. Notify your supervisor and the Biosafety Office (785-3550). After 30 minutes Enter the lab with PPE and spill cleanup materials. Full-face protection, lab coat, gloves and utility gloves should be worn. Transfer rotors or buckets to a biological safety cabinet. Immerse rotor/buckets in 70% ethanol or a non-corrosive disinfectant effective against the agent in use and c ompatible with the material the rotor is made of. Allow at least a one -hour contact time. Intact tubes may be wiped down and placed into a new container. Handle any broken glass with forceps and discard into a sharps container. Carefully retrieve any br oken glass from inside the centrifuge using forceps and discard into a sharps container. Smaller pieces of glass may be collected with cotton or paper towels held with forceps. Carefully wipe the inside of the centrifuge with disinfectant. Spray the inside of the centrifuge with disinfectant and allow to air dry. If bleach was used, follow by wiping with 70% ethanol to remove any corrosive residues. Place contaminated items and disposable PPE in an autoclave bag and autoclave. Decontaminate reusable PP E Wash hands with soap and water. 11.8 Spill of a Biohazardous Radioactive Material A spill involving a biohazard and radioactive material requires emergency procedures different than the procedures used for either material alone. Use procedures that protect you from the radiochemical while you disinfect the biological material. Follow the steps below as soon as the spill happens: Avoid inhaling aerosols while leaving the room; and notify others to leave as well. Close door(s) to the area and post a warning si gn indicating there is a spill, do not enter, and the time of the spill. Be aware that you may be spreading contamination, both biological and radioactive, so reduce movement once in a safe area. Remove contaminated clothing, turning exposed areas inward, and place in a biohazard bag labeled with a radioactive materials label or a radioactive waste container labeled with a biohazard label. If material splashed onto anyone, monitor the person for radioactive contamination using the appropriate radiation dete ction instrument. Wash all exposed skin with soap and water for 15 minutes. Call the EHS Emergency number at (203) 785- 3555 to report the spill. Inform supervisor of the spill. Monitor all personnel that were in the vicinity of the spill for radiation. If personal radioactive contamination is found, record the counts per minute found. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 11-5 Clean -Up of a Biohazardous Radioactive Material Before any clean up, consider the type of radionuclide, characteristics of the microorganism, and the volume of the spill. Th is information is important when determining which disinfectant to use on the spill. For isotope clean -up procedures contact the EHS at (203) 785- 3550. Allow aerosols to disperse for at least 30 minutes before reentering the laboratory. Assemble clean -up materials (disinfectant, autoclavable containers, forceps, towel, and sponges), and confirm with Radiation Safety that it is safe to enter the lab. Put on PPE (gown, face protection, which can consist of a full -face shield or surgical mask and safety glasses, double gloves, and shoe covers). Depending on the nature of the biological material involved, it may be advisable to wear a HEPA-filtered respirator instead of a surgical mask. Note: Everyone wearing a respirator has to complete respirator training, m edical clearance, and be fit tested to the respirator. If these requirements have not been completed a respirator cannot be worn. Cover the area with disinfectant -soaked towels, and carefully pour disinfectant around the spill working from the edge of the spill towards the center. Avoid enlarging the contaminated area. Use more concentrated disinfectant as it is diluted by the spill. Allow at least 20 minutes contact time. Do Not use bleach solutions on radioactive iodine containing material, radioiodine gas may be released. Instead, use an alternative disinfectant such as an iodophor or phenolic. Handle any sharp objects with forceps and discard into a sharps container. The container has to be labelled with both a biohazard label and a radioactive mat erials label if the items have not been biologically decontaminated. Wipe surrounding areas, where the spill may have splashed, with disinfectant. Pick up the paper towels used to cover the spill using forceps or tongs and place the biologically decontaminated waste, along with all PPE contaminated with radioactive materials, into an approved radioactive waste container. Label the container according to Radiation Safety Guidelines. Contaminated PPE must also be biologically decontaminated prior to disposa l as radioactive waste. Do Not autoclave the waste unless this action is approved by the Radiation Safety Officer. If waste cannot be autoclaved, please contact the EHS Biosafety and Radiation Safety offices for an alternative decontamination method (to be determined based on the waste profile). Wash hands and exposed skin areas with soap and water; monitor personnel and spill area for residual radioactive contamination. If skin contamination is found, repeat decontamination procedures under the direction of the Radiation Safety Officer. If the spill area has residual radioactive contamination, determine if it is fixed or removable and handle accordingly. Discard items contaminated with radioactive materials into the appropriate radioactive waste container: Place the contaminated item(s) on absorbent paper. Spray disinfectant (10% household bleach) on the contaminated areas and allow a 20 -minute contact time. Wrap the item(s) inside the paper and dispose of as radioactive waste. Wash hands with soap and water. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 11-6 11.9 BSL3 Spill Response Procedures Use the following guidelines for response to spills of BSL3 material outside of the biological safety cabinet or any other incident that may have generated an aerosol in the containment laboratory such as failure of physi cal containment devices during centrifugation. Immediate Action Hold breath and leave room immediately. Notify others in the room to evacuate immediately. Remove personal protective equipment (PPE) in the airlock or access zone; turn potentially contamina ted clothing inward; remove gloves last and wash any exposed skin areas with antiseptic soap and water. Post a Biohazard Spill Sign on the BL3 lab door. Notify Principal Investigator (PI) and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS). Do not reenter laboratory until it has been cleared for reentry by the PI or EHS. In general, a period of at least 30 minutes should be allowed before cleanup is attempted, but the time is contingent upon the supply and exhaust features of the lab. Cleaning the BSL3 Spill If the spill involves radioactive material also contact Radiation Safety. Once clearance has been given to reenter the spill area by the PI, in consultation with EHS, don the appropriate PPE and enter the spill area. While wearing PPE cover the spill area with paper towels or disinfectant soaked paper towels. Slowly pour concentrated disinfectant around the edge of the spill working towards the center (this will avoid enlarging the spill area). Avoid splashing and the creation of aerosols during this step. Allow a 15-20 -minute contact time for the disinfectant. While waiting, decontaminate the surrounding floor and work surfaces where splashes or larger aerosols may have settled around the spill. Use disinfectant soaked paper towels to wipe these areas (1 -10% household bleach solution is suitable for this purpose). After the 15 -20 minute contact time place the soiled paper towels into a biohazard bag. Repeat the decontamination procedure. After performing the decontamination procedure: Decontaminate any reusable items, such as forceps, by wiping debris off the items then soaking in a disinfectant solution. A soak in 1-10% household bleach solution for 15-20 minutes is sufficient. Since bleach is corrosive, follow the decontamination wi th a 70% ethanol wipe to remove any corrosive residues. Remove PPE, turning any exposed areas inward, and place into a biohazard bag. Generally, gloves are removed last, however, to avoid touching the face with gloved hands, remove gloves just before removing masks or eyewear. Decontaminate the exterior of biomedical waste containers. Wash hands well with soap and water for at least 15 -30 seconds. Autoclave all waste generated from the spill cleanup. Use fresh gloves for transport to the autoclave and wash hands after removing gloves. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 12-1 12 Select Agents Select agents are materials that have been identified by the U.S. Government as agents with potential for use in biological terrorism or warfare. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on (CDC) and the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), regulate select agents in the United States and its territories. Each agency has developed and maintains a list of select agents, including human, animal, and plant pathogens, high-risk toxins of biological origin, and prions. The current list of select agents is below, and can also be accessed from the web sites below : The Select Agent Registry home page: http://www.selectagents.gov/ (or search the internet for the term Federal Select Agent Program . Additional web links for select agent information are provided below. CDC Division of Select Agents and Toxins: https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/dsat.htm USDA Agriculture Select Agent information/SA_Ag_Select_Agent The federal select agent regulations were updated and changes have tak en effect as of March 21, 2017 . The most significant changes are an update of the select agents and toxins list (as reflected in Appendix A of this plan) and the change in the permissible amounts of toxins allowed per laboratory for exemption from registration. The list of Tier 1 sel ect agents and toxins has also been updated and are also included in Appendix A. Institutions that possess or work with Tier 1 agents will have to implement additional personnel screening and ongoing personal screening requirements beyond the current fede ral background checks. Yale University is not currently registered for Tier 1 agents. A personnel screening program will be developed prior to the receipt of Tier 1 agents. In addition to the enhanced screening requirements for personnel with access to Tier 1 select agents, additional physical security measures have been added for locations where Tier 1 select agents are either stored or used. Yale University's current select agent laboratory is in conformity with the additional physical security measur es that are required for research with Tier 1 select agents and toxins. National concerns over select agents have led to an expansion in security requirements for these materials. As a result, entities and researchers in possession of these materials have additional obligations and responsibilities for their safe storage, use, transfer, and disposal. 12.1 Possession, Use, or Transfer of Select Agents In order to possess, use, send or receive Select Agents, an institution and each individual who will have access to the Select Agent(s) must first satisfy the following requirements. Each requirement must be approved prior to possession, use or transfer. Register with the applicable U.S. Governing bodies (CDC, APHIS, and/or USDA) through the Yale Office of Enviro nmental Health & Safety (EHS). Register with the State of Connecticut Department of Public Health through Yale EHS. This is required for those Select Agents that are human pathogens. Official authorization granted for each individual requesting access to Select Agents provided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the applicable U.S. Governing body, and Yale University. Please note that violations of Select Agent rules and regulations can lead to severe criminal or civil penalties. Imprisonment and f ines up to $ 250,000.00 may be levied against individuals who are found in violation of these laws.

(Safety and Security) Receive final approval and authorization from Yale EHS, FBI, and the applicable governing body that you and each indi vidual requesting access to Select Agents, the proposed storage location for Select Agents, and the Select Agent research areas have been cleared. (This is provided in the form of an approval letter from the Yale Biological Safety Committee). This is only a general description of the process and it could take 6 to 9 months (or longer) from the time of the initial application to the time a federal inspection is scheduled for the proposed select agent research. Your laboratory will be subject to Yale and federal inspection or audit prior to initiation of work and at any time during your possession of Select Agents. 12.6 Discovery of Select Agents or Unknown Samples Please notify EHS immediately if: You identify any Select Agent pathogen or toxin listed on the current federal list that was not previously registered by your lab You discover a toxin not previously reported by your laboratory in excess of either the Yale Watch List or the federal maxim um allowable quantities listed above. You discover any unknown materials in your laboratory for assistance with identification. These discoveries must be reported to the applicable governmental institution. 12.7 Intrafacility Transfer of Select Agents Select ag ent pathogens and toxins may not be transferred outside of, to, or within Yale University unless EHS and federal approval has been granted. An intrafacility transfer is defined as the transfer of a Select Agent from one EHS and federally registered Select Agent lab to a similarly registered laboratory. Select Agents may not be transferred to a laboratory that is not registered with EHS and the applicable governmental institution. Once approved, intrafacility transfers will be overseen by EHS. Please con tact the EHS Biosafety Office for additional information. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 12-6 12.8 Destruction of Select Agents or Unknown Samples Select Agent pathogens or toxins may not be destroyed until Yale EHS and the applicable government institution has provided approval for the destructi on. Once approval has been granted for the destruction of Select Agents, Yale EHS will officially assume possession of the material and record its destruction. The governing institution will alert Yale if witnesses are required. If you have any questions regarding the Yale of Federal Select Agent process, please don't hesitate to contact the EHS Biosafety Office or your EHS Safety Advisor at 785 -3550. 12.9 Additional Information Information on the Select Agent Program may be found at the following web sites: Yale EHS: https://ehs.yale.edu/select -agents-bsl -three Centers for Disease of Exclusio n for attenuated -import information/SA_Ag_Select_Agent Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-1 13 Research Involving Recombinant and Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules The NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acids (NIH Guidelines) are a set of research requirements for any institutions receiving funding from the NIH for molecular biology research . As Yale receives NIH funding for this type of research , the NIH Guidelines must be followed by every PI at the University, regardless of their source of funding for this research , which is a central condition of the NIH funding agreement. 13.1 Principal Investigator Responsibilities Under the NIH Guidelines Principal Investigators are responsible for full compliance with the NIH Guidelines. Core responsibilities include: Identifying if their research is subject to t he NIH Guidelines Determining which section of the Guidelines are applicable to their work Proposing an appropriate biocontainment level (BSL) to ensure that the research is performed safely Obtaining authorization from the Yale Biological Safety Committee prior to starting any research that is subject to the NIH Guidelines Non-exempt recombinant DNA experiments, which must be registered with, and approved by, the Biosafety Committee prior to initiation, are defined in the left -hand column of the Registration and Approval of rDNA Experiments document found in appendix E of the Biosafety Manual. These include experiments that involve: The deliberately transfer a drug resistance trait to a microorganism Human gene transfer Cloning DN A or RNA encoding molecules lethal to vertebrates at an LD50 of <100 \u00b5 g/kg body weight Human or animal pathogens as host -vector systems Cloning of DNA or RNA from certain pathogens Recombinant DNA work in whole animals or plants Large-scale DNA work with m ore than 10 liters of culture More specific information on the classification of non -exempt recombinant DNA experiments is provided below. Please review the examples of non -exempt experiments and ensure that your laboratory is registered for proposed rDNA experiments prior to initiation where applicable. The examples provided include work that is commonly miss-classified by investigators. The end of this Section of the Biosafety Manual includes relevant fact sheets from the NIH Office of Biotechnology Act ivities that are useful resources for Principal Investigators. The following table from the NIH provides an overview of rDNA experiments and the level of review required for each category. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-2 13.1.1 Level of Review for rDNA Experiments Level of Review Example of rDNA Experiment NIH Guideline Section IBC and NIH Director Approval Experiments that compromise the control of disease agents in medicine through deliberate transfer or a drug resistance trait III-A IBC Approval and NIH review Deliberate formation of rDNA containing genes coding for a toxin with an LD50 < 100 ng/kg III-B IBC and IRB and FDA Approval Introduction of rDNA into human subjects (Human gene transfer) III-C IBC Approval before initiation Wide range (rDNA experiments involving pathogens, defective vectors, animals, plants, and large scale projects) III-D IBC Notice at initiation Creating transgenic rodents, low risk rDNA Plant experiments III-E Exempt - registration not required Those do not represent a significant risk to health or the environment III-F Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-3 Principal Investigator s are responsible for ensuring that their researchers are trained in safe work practices and that everyone working in the laboratory is aware of the emergency response procedures that must be followed . Staff must also be alerted of the rationale for any special medical surveillance restrictions or immunizations. Once work has been initiated, Principal Investigators must also supervise and moni tor staff for their adherence to safety protocols. If the scope of research changes significantly, the Principal Investigator must update their rDNA protocol with the Yale Biological Safety Committee and await confirmation in writing that the protocol chan ge has been approved. It is also important that Principal Investigators report any significant problem, such as a violation of the NIH Guidelines or any significant research related accidents, exposures or illnesses to the Yale Biological Safety Committee and the Environmental Health and Safety Office (both can be reached at 203 -785-3550). 13.2 Overview of Recombinant DNA Experiments Covered by The NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines) April 2019 The NIH Guidelines describe experiments that must be registered and approved by Institution's Biological Safety Committee and those experiments that are exempt from the Guidelines and do not require registration. For institutions that receive funding from the NIH for molecular biology research, the Guidelines become a condition of the receipt of funding. For Yale to continue to receive funding from the NIH, ALL researchers MUST COMPLY with the NIH Guidelines, regardless of funding source for molecular bio logy research. Persistent failure of an institution to comply with the NIH Guidelines can lead to suspension of research privileges. Systemic failure to comply with the Guidelines may result in the freezing of funds directed at an institution by the NIH. The phrase rDNA is used throughout this document and re fers to recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules to reflect earlier changes in the March 2013 and November 2013 versions of the NIH Guidelines. Link to current NIH Guidelines: https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/nih- guidelines/ 13.2.1 Categories of rDNA Work That Require Registration 1. Cloning a therapeutic antibiotic resistance gene into a human, animal or plant pathogen, if the transfer could compromise the ability to treat or control the disease. (Section III-A-1) Note: Registration with the institution's Biological Safety Committee is still required even if: this drug resistance is acquired naturally (the Committee will determine if it is a Major Action or not and communicate with the NIH Office of Science Policy (OSP) as needed); the transferred resistance gene is related to a drug that is an end of the line alternative treatment (2nd, 3 rd, 4th, or 5th line drug) - the Committee w ill determine if the proposed research qualifies as a Major Action or not; the drug was used years ago, but is not the preferred treatment today (it may be the only treatment in developing countries); the drug is only used to treatment a very small portion of the population (i.e. those with specific contraindications to front line drugs) Working with antibiotic resistance strains of pathogens also require registration (even if you did not create them) - please submit a registration form to the Biological Safety Committee Examples: Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-4 Cloning a gene for Erythromycin resistance into Borrelia burgdorferi (may not qualify as a Major Action, but the Institutional Biosafety Committee must review prior to initiation) Cloning a gene for Chloramphenicol resistance int o Rickettsia typhi a gene for resistance into a gene for Rifampin resistance into Mycobacterium tuberculosis Caution: Be careful when using old plasmids for cloning experiments involving pathogens. Many of t he old plasmids carry genes for antibiotics that have been used therapeutically or are related to front line drugs. Avoid using these plasmids when working with related pathogens; Verify that the antibiotic resistance gene is not in a location on the plas mid that can be transferred to the pathogen via a double cross over event.

Cloning DNA encoding for a low LD50 toxin or work with vectors that express toxins with a low LD50 (< 100 \u00b5g/kg body weight). (Section III -B-1) Examples of toxins with low LD50's are: Botulinum toxin Staphylococcal enterotoxin B Tetrodotoxin Clostridium tetanus toxin Website to visit for additional information: Univ. of Florida - Toxin Lists: http://www.ehs.ufl.edu/Bio/toxin.htm 3. Human Gene Transfer Experiments (Section III-C -1) The deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA, into one or more human research participants are subject to the NIH Guidelines. This includes the transfer of DNA with defective viral vectors, such as retroviral, adenoviral and lentiviral vectors, along with the use of liposomes and other methods of delivery. Human gene transfer experiments with synthetic nucleic acid molecules also require registration if any of the following criteria are met: The synthetic nucleic acid molecules: Contain more than 100 nucleotides; or Possess biological properties that enable integration into the genome (e.g. cis elements involved integration); or Have the potential to replicate in a cell; or Can be translated or transcribed These experiments also require approval from the institutional review board at the institution (Yale Human Investigation Committee) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Creation of transgenic animals: i. Mice, rats ii. Zebrafish iii. Drosophila, butterflies iv. Caenorhabditis elegans v. Other Note: For rodents only, the purchase or transfer of transgenic rodents is exempt from the NIH rDNA Guidelines and does not require registration (if the transgene used does not code for a toxic, virulent or oncogenic sequence). Purchase is defined as buy ing a transgenic rodent that has been created by another entity outside of your laboratory. The transfer of a transgenic rodent to your laboratory is also exempt (provided the transgene doesn't code for toxic, oncogenic or potentially harmful gene). Transf er is defined as the acquisition into your research lab of a transgenic animal created (made) by another entity. Note: In each case above, you may have designed or created the gene that has been inserted into the developing embryo of the transgenic rode nt, but if you are not the group that has performed the actual procedure (i.e. the lab that inserted the gene into the embryo), you are exempt from the rDNA Guidelines. If your lab will insert the gene into the embryo, you must register this work. Knock -out Animals Knock -out (gene silencing, gene ablation, etc.) rodents are exempt from the NIH Guidelines as long as the method to generate the knock-out animal does not leave any \"new\" genetic material behind in the genome after the procedure. If DNA from t he molecule used to create the knock -out is permanently inserted into the genome, the experiment will require registration with the Yale Biological Safety Committee. Exemption for Breeding Transgenic Rodents Note: Generation of transgenic rodents by breedi ng to create a new strain shall be EXEMPT from the NIH Guidelines if the following criteria are met. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-7 Both parental rodents can be housed under BSL1 containment; AND Neither parental transgenic rodent contains the following genetic modifications: Incorpor ation of more than 50% of the genome of an exogenous eukaryotic virus from a single family of viruses; OR Incorporation of a transgene that is under the control of a gammaretroviral long terminal repeat (LTR); AND The transgenic rodent that results from th is breeding is not expected to contain more than 50% of an exogenous viral genome from a single family of viruses. This exemption DOES NOT pertain to other transgenic animals such as zebrafish, drosophila, rabbits, pigs, etc. It also DOES NOT pertain to transgenic experiments involving plants. 7. Large Scale rDNA Experiments (Section III-D -6) Any rDNA experiments at any level or Risk Group, including exempt and non-exempt experiments that generate a volume of culture that is in excess of 10 liters require reg istration with the Yale Biological Safety Committee. Examples include: Growing 10.1 L of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a fermentation apparatus to get a sufficient yield of the desired protein. Growing up five 2 L flasks of E. coli K -12 cultures expressing your gene of interest would not qualify as a large scale experiment under the NIH Guidelines, but given the high volume, please register this volume of work with the Institutional Biological Safety Committee in order for an appropriate risk assessment of t he proposed work. 8. Synthetic Nucleic Acid Experiments that are covered by the Guidelines: Research that presents biosafety risks equivalent to rDNA research that is subject to the NIH Guidelines such as research with a genetically modified virus or a vector derived solely by synthetic techniques. The molecules can replicate They can generate nucleic acids that can replicate in a living cell They can integrate into a host cell's DNA They produce a toxin that is lethal for vertebrates at an LD50 of less than 1 00 nanograms/kilogram body weight They synthesize an organism that doesn't occur naturally outside of a laboratory setting (i.e. 1918 H1N1 Influenza) 13.2.2 Synthetic Nucleic Acid Experiments that are EXEMPT from the Guidelines Introduction of certain synthetic nucleic acids into a biological system that is not expected to present a biosafety risk that requires review by the IBC Introduction of synthetic nucleic acid molecules into biological systems akin to processes of nucleic acid transfer that already occur in nature. Experiments with synthetic nucleic acid molecules that are not contained in cells, organisms or viruses Those synthetic nucleic acid molecules that meet the following criteria shall be exempt: Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-8 1) Those that can neither replicate nor generate nucleic acids that can replicate in any living cell (e.g. oligonucleotides or other synthetic that do not contain an origin of replication or contain elements known to interact with either DNA or RNA polymerase), and 2) Those that are not designed to integrate into D NA, and 3) Those that do not produce a toxin that is lethal for vertebrates at and LD50 of less than 100 nanograms per kilogram body weight. An example of an exempt synthetic nucleic acid molecule is a synthetic short interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets an H IV viral protein required for transcription activation, even if this siRNA is injected into animals or used in cell culture. Also exempt are those synthetic nucleic acid molecules that consist solely of the exact recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid se quence from a single source that exists outside of a laboratory setting. (Research with nucleic acid sequences for organisms that do not currently exist in nature outside of the laboratory setting would not be exempt (e.g. an identical copy of the 1918 H1N 1 influenza virus) The chemical synthesis of nucleic acids (the NIH Guidelines only apply once synthetic nucleic acids are placed in a biological system).

The section is now III-F-8 Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-23 Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-25 13.6 NIH OSP Ma jor Actions Under Sections III -A of the NIH Guidelines Major Actions under Section III-A of the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules - May 2019 1. What experiments are considered \"Major Actions\" under the NIH Guidelines ? Under the NIH Guidelines , the term \"Major Action\" means that NIH Director approval is required. Only one type of experiment requires NIH Director approval - the deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait to a microorganism when such resistance could compromise the ability to control the disease agent in humans, veterinary medicine, or agriculture (see Section III -A-1-a of the NIH Guidelines ). 2. What criteria should be used to determine if the transfer of a particular drug resistance trait is considered a Major Action under Se ction III-A-1 -a of the NIH Guidelines ? An experiment may be considered a Major Action if: 1) it involves the use of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acids to introduce drug resistance into a microorganism, and 2) the drug in question is used to treat disea se caused by the organism in humans, veterinary medicine, or agriculture. The experiment would not be considered a Major Action if there is sufficient documentation that resistance to a therapeutically useful concentration of that drug exists in the agent outside of a laboratory setting. Such evidence should be in the form of articles published in the scientific literature. 3. What is considered a therapeutically useful drug? A drug is therapeutically useful if it is effective in the treatment of the diseas e caused by the microorganism. It does not have to be the 'first line' agent but should be recognized in the scientific literature as a useful drug. In vitro sensitivity to the drug is not sufficient; it must be useful in vivo . In addition, if a drug is no t therapeutically useful but will confer cross resistance to a therapeutically useful drug, then this also is considered a III-A-1 -a experiment. A drug is considered to be useful for treatment even if its use is limited to the treatment of a specific patie nt population (for example, children or pregnant women), or it is primarily used for treatment outside of the United States where alternative drugs are not available (e.g., chloramphenicol is not in common use in the U.S. but is used in many other countries). 4. Can an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) determine if a particular experiment meets the criteria of Section III -A-1-a or must NIH make the determination? The investigator should make an initial assessment regarding whether a particular experiment constitutes a Major Action, with confirmation by the IBC. IBCs are encouraged to contact the NIH Office of Science Policy (OSP) if they need assistance in assessing whether a specific experiment involving the deliberate transfer of a drug resistance tr ait falls under Section III -A-1-a and therefore requires NIH Director approval. IBCs may also consult with NIH OSP regarding experiments that raise important public Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-26 Major Actions under Section III-A of the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules - May 2019 health issues but do not meet the criteria of Section III -A-1 -a (e.g., because there is low frequency of resistance to a drug). NIH OSP will consult, as needed, with appropriate experts, as needed. 5. What are the steps in the review process for a Section III -A-1-a experiment? The steps in the review process are 1) submission of relevant information on the proposed experiment to NIH OSP, 2) publication of the proposal in the Federal Register for 15 days of comment, and 3) if approved, containment conditions and any special requirements for the experiments will be stipulated by the NIH Director. 6. Does the IBC need to review the proposal before it is sent to NIH? The IBC may initiate its review of these experiments before or after submission to and approval/denial from NIH. The IBC's final determination should occur after approval by the NIH Director, because the IBC must take into account any special conditions that the NIH Director has stipulated as a condition of approval and ensure that they are implemented. Research that meets the criteria for Section III- A-1-a cannot be initiated unless approval is granted by the NIH Director (or NIH OSP in the case of an equivalent experiment). 7. What infor mation needs to be submitted to NIH OSP for review of research that involves the transfer of drug resistance that may ultimately be reviewed and approved by the NIH Director? Information about the proposed experiment that NIH requires to determine whether the experiment meets the criteria of Section III -A-1 -a of the NIH Guidelines includes technical information about the proposed transfer of drug resistance (e.g., the vector(s) , gene(s) encoding the resistance, degree(s) of resistance, cross-resistance to other drugs, and other pertinent characteristics of the recombinant construct). If the experiment is considered to be a III-A-1 -a experiment, the following additional information must be submitted to NIH OSP: Rationale for why the work should go forward, including an assessment of how the scientific and public health benefits outweigh the potential risks for humans, animals, or agriculture. A discussion of whether there are alte rnative approaches to this research that would not involve conferring resistance to a drug that has utility in the treatment of disease caused by the organism in question. This should include a statement indicating whether the submitting investigator or ot hers have considered any alternatives. A description of the proposed risk mitigation strategies that will be implemented to minimize risk to laboratory personnel as well as to the public. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-27 Major Actions under Section III-A of the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules - May 2019 Minutes, if available, of any IBC discussion of the research in question (IBC review is not required prior to NIH review and NIH Director approval/denial, but a preliminary review is desirable). IBC contact information In addition, NIH may also request that the following information be submitted: Description of the biosafety features of the room(s) in which the research will be conducted. Most recent inspection report(s) of the room(s) in which the research will be conducted, including any reports of biosafety equipment failures or biosafety- related problems that have occurred in these rooms in the last two years. Biosafety manual for the proposed work. Description of any add itional biosafety training that laboratory personnel will receive specific to the research question. Description of any special occupational health requirements for the laboratory personnel involved in the research (e.g., vaccination, medical surveillance) . Submission of relevant information on a proposed Section III-A -1-a experiment should be made to NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov 8. Who approves Section III -A-1-a experiments? The NIH Director approves these experiments. These experiments may not proceed unless approved by the NIH Director and the IBC. 9. Once a Section III-A -I-a experiment has been approved by NIH, do equivalent experiments also need to be approved by the NIH Director? Once a Section III- A-I-a experiment has been approved by the NIH D irector, equivalent experiments may not need to follow the same approval process to determine the appropriate biosafety containment level for the work. Under Section III-B -2 of the NIH Guidelines (Experiments that Require NIH and IBC Approval Before Initia tion), NIH may determine that a proposed experiment is equivalent to one that has previously been approved by the NIH Director as a Major Action. An experiment will be considered equivalent only if, as determined by NIH, there are no substantive difference s in methodology and other pertinent information has not emerged since submission of the initial III -A-1 -a experiment that would change the biosafety and/or public health considerations for the proposed experiment. If NIH makes such a determination, experi ments deemed to be equivalent will not require review and approval under Section III -A-1-a. These experiments will have been approved by NIH and may proceed once approved by the appropriate IBC. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-29 Major Actions under Section III-A of the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules - May 2019 10. My research involves the transfer of a drug resistance trait into an organism on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and/or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent list (i.e. is a \"restricted experiment\") and thus requires approval from those agencies. Do I also need to submit a request to NIH for approval? Experiments utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules that i nvolve the deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait into a Select Agent (that meet the definition of a restricted experiment) may be subject to the regulatory authority of, and review by, HHS and/or USDA under their respective rules (found in 42 CFR Part 73, 7 CFR Part 331, and 9 CFR Part 121). Review and approval by the appropriate Federal agency (HHS or USDA) supersedes the requirement for approval under the NIH Guidelines. However, other provisions of the NIH Guidelines for example, IBC review and approval are still applicable. 11. I am conducting research that involves the transfer of resistance to certain drugs in a strain of a Select Agent that has been excluded or exempted from the Select Agent regulations. From which agency do I need to get approval? Potential III -A-1-a experiments in strains of Select Agents that have been excluded or exempted from the Select Agent regulations should be submitted to NIH OSP . 12.

Under which section of the NIH Guidelines does the generation of transgenic rodents fall? The creation of transgenic rodents falls under one of two sections of the NIH Guidelines depending on the containment level required to house the rodents. Experiments involving the creation of transgenic rodents that can be housed under Biosafety Level 1 c onditions are covered under Section III- E-3. Experiments involving the generation of transgenic rodents requiring BL2, BL3 and BL4 containment are covered under Section III-D -4. 2. Under which section of the NIH Guidelines does the generation of transgenic an imals other than rodents fall? The creation of all transgenic animals (other than rodents that can be housed under BL1 containment conditions) is covered under Section III -D-4 of the NIH Guidelines . 3. Would the breeding of two different lines of knock -out mi ce require IBC approval under the NIH Guidelines ? If the technique used to create the knock-out mice involves the stable introduction of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules into the animal's genome, the animals will be considered transgenic. As the breeding of two different lines of knock-out animals will potentially generate a novel line of transgenic animal, the work may be covered under the NIH Guidelines and require IBC review and approval. Sections in the NIH Guidelines that cover work with rodents include III -E-3 for work that requires Biosafety Level (BL) 1 containment and III -D-4 for work that requires BL2, BL3 and BL4 containment. Certain breeding experiments are exempt under Appendix C -VIII of the NIH Guidelines . This exemption covers the breeding of two different lines of transgenic rodents or the breeding of a transgenic rodent and a non -transgenic rodent with the intent of creating a new line of transgenic rodent that can be housed at BL1 if: 1. both parental rodents can be housed under BL1 containment; and 2. neither parental transgenic rodent contains the following genetic modifications: o incorporation of more than one -half of the genome of an exogenous eukaryotic virus from a single family of viruses; or o incorporation of a transgene that is under the control of a gammaretroviral long terminal repeat (LTR); and 3. the transgenic rodent that results from this breeding is not expected to contain more than one- half of an exogenous viral genome from a single family of viruses. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-31 FAQs for Research on Genetically Modified (Transgenic) Animals - May 2019 4. Is IBC registration and approval needed for the maintenance of a transgenic animal colony? The maintenance of a transgenic rodent colony (i.e. breeding within a particular transgenic line) that can be housed at BL1 is an activity that is exempt from the NIH Guidelines and, as such, does not require IBC registration and approval. The maintenance of a transgenic rodent colony at BL2 or higher falls under Section III-D -4-b and requires IBC approval. The breeding of all other transgenic animals is subject to the NIH Guidelines under Section III- D-4-a or III-D -4-b depending on the containment level required. 5. Is the purchase and transfer of transgenic rodents exempt from the NIH Guidelines ? Under Appendix C -VII of the NIH Guidelines , the purchase or transfer of transgenic rodents that may be housed under BL1 containment are activities that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines . The purchase or transfer of transgenic rodents that require BL2 or higher containment is not exempt from the NIH Guidelines . These animals are covered under Section III-D -4, and purchase and transfer of such animals requires IBC registration and approval . It should be noted that the subsequent use of transgenic rodents may not be exempt from the NIH Guidelines . Experiments using transgenic rodents at BL1 are exempt from the NIH Guidelines if the research does not involve the use of recombinant or syntheti c nucleic acid molecules. If the protocol does involve the use of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, then the work falls under III -D- 4 of the NIH Guidelines and as such requires IBC review and approval prior to initiation. 6. Is the purchase and transfer of transgenic animals other than rodents exempt from the NIH Guidelines ? No, only the purchase or transfer of transgenic rodents that may be maintained at BL1 containment is exempt from the NIH Guidelines . The purchase or transfer of any other an imal for research purposes at any biosafety level (including BL1) is not exempt, nor is the purchase and transfer of transgenic rodents that require BL2 or higher containment. 7. Are gene ablation studies covered by the NIH Guidelines ? The answer to this ques tion depends on the technique employed in the study. If recombinant techniques are used to knock out the gene, then the work would be covered under the NIH Guidelines . 8. Who has the responsibility to review the generation of transgenic animals if an institut ion is generating animals for investigators who are not affiliated with that institution? The generation (creation) of transgenic animals is an activity covered under the NIH Guidelines . The IBC at the institution where that activity is occurring has the r esponsibility to review and approve that activity (if the institution is subject to the requirements of the NIH Guidelines ). The subsequent use of the animals by an investigator not at that institution would need to be reviewed and approved by the IBC at t hat investigator's institution if that institution conducts or supports research with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, receives NIH support for such research, and the activity is covered under the NIH Guidelines . Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-33 FAQs for Research on Genetically Modified (Transgenic) Animals - May 2019 9. When a core facility generates transgenic mice as a \"fee for service\" for a Principal Investigator (PI), is it the responsibility of the PI or the core facility to register the generation of the mice with the IBC? Section IV -B-7-a-(1) of the NIH Guidelines articulates one of the responsibilities of the PI as 'initiating no recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules research which requires IBC approval prior to initiation until that research has been approved by the IBC and has met all other requirements of the NIH Guidelines .' It would be acceptable for either the PI of the core facility or the PI purchasing the transgenic animals to fulfill the responsibility to register the generation of the animals. In many cases, the animals being generated will be s ubsequently used in experiments that are subject to the NIH Guidelines , and the registration of the research with the IBC may encompass both the generation and subsequent experimentation with the animals. 10. When existing transgenic animals at an institution are purchased or transferred to an investigator outside the institution, who should review and approve the use of these animals? An institution's IBC does not need to review and approve the use of transgenic animals at another institution. If the receivin g institution is subject to the NIH Guidelines (i.e. receives NIH support for research with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules), then the purchase and transfer of animals (other than rodents that can be housed under BL1 containment), along wit h any experiments subject to the NIH Guidelines , would require review and approval by the IBC at that institution. 11. What are the NIH Guidelines requirements for research with large transgenic animals (sheep, pigs, etc.), or research with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid - modified microorganisms in such animals? When conducting research with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules in large animals, the work is covered under Appendix M of the NIH Guidelines . Appendix M specifies containment and confinement practices when animals are of a size or have growth requirements that preclude the use of laboratory containment of animals. The NIH Guidelines include provisions for tracking and inventorying these animals (Appendix M -1-B-2 states that a perman ent record must be maintained of the experimental use and disposal of each animal). Animal carcasses must be disposed of as to avoid their use as food for human beings or animals unless food use is specifically authorized by an appropriate federal agency ( Appendix M -1-B-1). An acceptable method, for example, would be incineration. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-34 FAQs for Research on Genetically Modified (Transgenic) Animals - May 2019 12. Are recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid modifications to the somatic cells of nontransgenic animals subject to the NIH Guidelines ? Yes, these experiments are subject to the NIH Guidelines . Sections III-D -1-a through III-D -1-d cover experiments using Risk Group 2, 3, 4, or restricted agents in whole animals. See the NIH Guidelines for the appropriate containment for such experiments Section III -D-4-a covers experiments involving viable recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid- modified microorganisms tested on whole animals. Recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid from any source except for greater than two -thirds of a eukaryotic viral genome may be transferred to any animal and propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to BL1 or BL1-N and ap propriate to the organism under study. Section III -D-4-b covers recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid, or DNA or RNA derived therefrom, involving whole animals, including transgenic animals that are not covered by Sections III-D -1 or III-D -4-a. The appropr iate containment for these experiments is determined by the IBC. Experiments not included in Sections III- A, III-B, III -C, III -D, III-F, fall into Section III -E. Experiments covered by Section III- E may be conducted at BL1 containment. For further informa tion about the requirements of the NIH Guidelines , please email: NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov .

What kinds of incidents involving research subject to the NIH Guidelines must be reported to the NIH OSP? The NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines) states that \"...any significant problems, violations of the NIH Guide lines, or any significant research -related accidents and illnesses\" must be reported to NIH within 30 days. Certain types of accidents must be reported on a more expedited basis. Spills or accidents in BL2 laboratories resulting in an overt exposure must b e immediately reported to NIH. Spills or accidents occurring in high containment (BL3 or BL4) laboratories resulting in an overt or potential exposure must be immediately reported to NIH. Relevant incidents would include spills and accidents which result i n overt exposures to organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules in the laboratory, rather than serious adverse events that may occur in the conduct of human gene transfer research. 2. How serious must a problem be to warrant reportin g to NIH OSP? Any spill or accident involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research of the nature described above or that otherwise leads to personal injury or illness or to a breach of containment must be reported to NIH OSP. These kinds of events might include skin punctures with needles containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, the escape or improper disposition of a transgenic animal, or spills of high -risk recombinant or synthetic materials occurring outside of a bio safety cabinet. Failure to adhere to the containment and biosafety practices articulated in the NIH Guidelines must also be reported to NIH OSP. Minor spills of low -risk agents not involving a breach of containment that were properly cleaned and decontaminated generally do not need to be reported. NIH OSP should be consulted if the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), investigator, or other institutional staff are uncertain whether the nature or severity of the incident warrants reporting; NIH OSP can a ssist in making this determination. 3. Who is responsible for reporting incidents involving research subject to the NIH Guidelines to NIH OSP? Under the NIH Guidelines incident reporting is articulated as a responsibility of the Institution, IBC, Biological Safety Officer, and Principal Investigator. Institutions have the discretion to determine which party should make these reports, and one report for each incident or set of information is generally sufficient. NIH Office of Science Policy Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 13-40 Incident Reporting - May 2019 4. What information should incident reports include? Incident reports should include sufficient information to allow for an understanding of the nature and consequences of the incident, as well as its cause. A detailed report should also include the measures that the institution took in response to mitigate the problem and to preclude its reoccurrence. An incident reporting template is available to facilitate reporting of incidents under the NIH Guidelines. The template may be found on the NIH OSP website. Use of the template is not required and other re port formats may be acceptable. 5. What does NIH OSP do with this information? NIH OSP staff review incident reports to assess whether the institutional response was sufficient. Depending on the adequacy of the institutional response, NIH OSP may ask the institution to take additional measures as appropriate to promote safety and compliance with the NIH Guidelines. 6. Where should incident reports be sent? Reports of incidents can be emailed to NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov . 7. Where can I get more information about the NIH Guidelines? Questions about the NIH Guidelines may be directed to NIH OSP staff at NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov . Staff may also be reached at (301) 496 -9838.

There are no biosafety level 4 facilities or biosafety level 4 work allowed at Yale University. The CDC and NIH have established biosafety guidelines that are found in the CDC/NIH publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL). The following is reprinted from the 5 th edition of the BMBL revised December 2009 for addition al information please contact the Biosafety Office at 785 -3550. Section III\u2014 Principles of Biosafety A fundamental objective of any biosafety program is the containment of potentially harmful biological agents. The term \"containment\" is used in describing safe methods, facilities and equipment for managing infectious materials in the laboratory environment where they are being handled or maintained. The purpose of containment is to reduce or eliminate exposure of laboratory workers, other persons, and the outside environment to potentially hazardous agents. The use of vaccines may provide an increased level of personal protection. The risk assessment of the work to be done with a specific agent will determine the appropriate combination of these elements. Laboratory Practices and Technique The most important element of containment is strict adherence to standard microbiological practices and techniques. Persons working with infectious agents or potentially infected materials must be aware of potential hazards, and must be trained and proficient in the practices and techniques required for handling such material safely. The director or person in charge of the laboratory is responsible for providing or arranging the appropriate training of personnel. Each laborat ory should develop or adopt a biosafety or operations manual that identifies the hazards that will or may be encountered, and that specifies practices and procedures designed to minimize or eliminate exposures to these hazards. Personnel should be advised of special hazards and should be required to read and follow the required practices and procedures. A scientist, trained and knowledgeable in appropriate laboratory techniques, safety procedures, and hazards associated with handling infectious agents must be responsible for the conduct of work with any infectious agents or materials. This individual should consult with biosafety or other health and safety professionals with regard to risk assessment. When standard laboratory practices are not sufficient to control the hazards associated with a particular agent or laboratory procedure, additional measures may be needed. The laboratory director is responsible for selecting additional safety practices, which must be in keeping with the hazards associated with t he agent or procedure. Appropriate facility design and engineering features, safety equipment, and management practices must supplement laboratory personnel, safety practices, and techniques. Safety Equipment (Primary Barriers and Personal Protective Equipment) Safety equipment includes BSCs, enclosed containers, and other engineering controls designed to remove or minimize exposures to hazardous biological materials. The BSC is the principal device used to provide containment of infectious droplets or aer osols generated by many microbiological procedures. Three types of BSCs (Class I, II, III) used in microbiological laboratories are described and illustrated in Appendix A. Open -fronted Class I and Class II BSCs are primary barriers that offer significant levels of protection to laboratory personnel and to the environment when used with good microbiological techniques. The Class II biological safety cabinet also provides protection from external contamination of the materials (e.g., cell cultures, microbiol ogical stocks) being manipulated inside the cabinet. The gas -tight Class III biological safety cabinet provides the highest attainable level of protection to personnel and the environment. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 A-2 An example of another primary barrier is the safety centrifuge cup, an enclosed container designed to prevent aerosols from being released during centrifugation. To minimize aerosol hazards, containment controls such as BSCs or centrifuge cups must be used when handling infectious agents. Safety equipment also may include items for personal protection, such as gloves, coats, gowns, shoe covers, boots, respirators, face shields, safety glasses, or goggles. Personal protective equipment is often used in combination with BSCs and other devices that contain the agents, animals, or materials being handled. In some situations in which it is impractical to work in BSCs, personal protective equipment may form the primary barrier between personnel and the infectious materials. Examples include certain animal studies, animal necropsy , agent production activities, and activities relating to maintenance, service, or support of the laboratory facility. Facility Design and Construction (Secondary Barriers) The design and construction of the facility contributes to the laboratory workers' protection, provides a barrier to protect persons outside the laboratory, and protects persons or animals in the community from infectious agents that may be accidentally released from the laboratory. Laboratory directors are responsible for providing faci lities commensurate with the laboratory's function and the recommended biosafety level for the agents being manipulated. The recommended secondary barrier(s) will depend on the risk of transmission of specific agents. For example, the exposure risks for mo st laboratory work in BSL-1 and BSL -2 facilities will be direct contact with the agents, or inadvertent contact exposures through contaminated work environments. Secondary barriers in these laboratories may include separation of the laboratory work area fr om public access, availability of a decontamination facility (e.g., autoclave), and hand washing facilities. When the risk of infection by exposure to an infectious aerosol is present, higher levels of primary containment and multiple secondary barriers ma y become necessary to prevent infectious agents from escaping into the environment. Such design features include specialized ventilation systems to directional airflow, air treatment systems to decontaminate or remove agents from exhaust air, controlled access zones, airlocks at laboratory entrances, or separate buildings or modules to isolate the laboratory. Design engineers for laboratories may refer to specific ventilation recommendations as found in the ASHRAE Laboratory Design Guide published by the Am erican Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air -Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). 1 Biosafety Levels Four BSLs are described in Section 4, which consist of combinations of laboratory practices and techniques, safety equipment, and laboratory facilities. Ea ch combination is specifically appropriate for the operations performed, the documented or suspected routes of transmission of the infectious agents, and the laboratory function or activity. The BSLs described in this manual should be differentiated from R isk Groups, as described in the NIH Guidelines and the World Health Organization Laboratory Biosafety Manual. Risk groups are the result of a classification of microbiological agents based on their association with, and resulting severity of, disease in hu mans. The risk group of an agent should be one factor considered in association with mode of transmission, procedural protocols, experience of staff, and other factors in determining the BSL in which the work will be conducted. The recommended biosafety level(s) for the organisms in Section VIII (Agent Summary Statements) represent those conditions under which the agent ordinarily can be safely handled. Of course, not all of the organisms capable of causing disease are included in Section VIII and an instit ution must be prepared to perform risk assessments for these agents using the best available information. Detailed information regarding the conduct of biological risk assessments can be found in Section II. The laboratory director is specifically and prim arily responsible for assessing the risks and applying the appropriate biosafety levels. The institution's Biological Safety Officer (BSO) and IBC can be of great assistance in performing and reviewing the required risk assessment. At one point, under the NIH Guidelines, BSOs were required only Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 A-3 when large-scale research or production of organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules was performed or when work with recombinant DNA molecules was conducted at BSL -3 or above. IBCs were required only when an ins titution was performing non-exempt recombinant DNA experiments. Today, however, it is strongly suggested that an institution conducting research or otherwise working with pathogenic agents have a BSO and properly constituted and functioning IBC. The responsibilities of each now extend beyond those described in the NIH Guidelines and depend on the size and complexity of the program. Generally, work with known agents should be conducted at the biosafety level recommended in Section VIII. When information is a vailable to suggest that virulence, pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance patterns, vaccine and treatment availability, or other factors are significantly altered, more (or less) stringent practices may be specified. Often an increased volume or a high concentration of agent may require additional containment practices. Biosafety Level 1 practices, safety equipment, and facility design and construction are appropriate for undergraduate and secondary educational training and teaching laboratories, and for other laboratories in which work is done with defined and characterized strains of viable microorganisms not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adult humans. Bacillus subtilis , Nigeria gruberi , infectious canine hepatitis virus, and exempt organis ms under the NIH Guidelines are representative of microorganisms meeting these criteria. Many agents not ordinarily associated with disease processes in humans are, however, opportunistic pathogens and may cause infection in the young, the aged, and immunodeficient or immunosuppressed individuals. Vaccine strains that have undergone multiple in vivo passages should not be considered avirulent simply because they are vaccine strains. BSL-1 represents a basic level of containment that relies on standard micro biological practices with no special primary or secondary barriers recommended, other than a sink for hand washing. Biosafety Level 2 practices, equipment, and facility design and construction are applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching, and other laboratories in which work is done with the broad spectrum of indigenous moderate-risk agents that are present in the community and associated with human disease of varying severity. With good microbiological techniques, these agents can be used safely in act ivities conducted on the open bench, provided the potential for producing splashes or aerosols is low. Hepatitis B virus, HIV, the Salmonella, and Toxoplasma are representative of microorganisms assigned to this containment level. BSL-2 is appropriate when work is done with any human-derived blood, body fluids, tissues, or primary human cell lines where the presence of an infectious agent may be unknown. (Laboratory personnel working with human-derived materials should refer to the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard 2 for specific required precautions). Primary hazards to personnel working with these agents relate to accidental percutaneous or mucous membrane exposures, or ingestion of infectious materials. Extreme caution should be taken with contaminated needles or sharp instruments. Even though organisms routinely manipulated at BSL -2 are not known to be transmissible by the aerosol route, procedures with aerosol or high splash potential that may increase the risk of such personnel exposure must be conducted in primary containment equipment, or in devices such as a BSC or safety centrifuge cups. Personal protective equipment should be used as appropriate, such as splash shields, face protection, gowns, and gloves. Secondary barriers, such as hand washing sink s and waste decontamination facilities, must be available to reduce potential environmental contamination. Biosafety Level 3 practices, safety equipment, and facility design and construction are applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching, research, or pr oduction facilities in which work is done with indigenous or exotic agents with a potential for respiratory transmission, and which may cause serious and potentially lethal infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Coxiella b urnetii are representative of the microorganisms assigned to this level. Primary hazards to personnel working with these agents relate Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 A-4 to autoinoculation, ingestion, and exposure to infectious aerosols. At BSL -3, more emphasis is placed on primary and seco ndary barriers to protect personnel in contiguous areas, the community, and the environment from exposure to potentially infectious aerosols. For example, all laboratory manipulations should be performed in a BSC or other enclosed equipment, such as a gas -tight aerosol generation chamber. Secondary barriers for this level include controlled access to the laboratory and ventilation requirements that minimize the release of infectious aerosols from the laboratory. Biosafety Level 4 practices, safety equipment , and facility design and construction are applicable for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life -threatening disease, which may be transmitted via the aerosol route and for which there is no available vaccine or ther apy. Agents with a close or identical antigenic relationship to BSL-4 agents also should be handled at this level. When sufficient data are obtained, work with these agents may continue at this level or at a lower level. Viruses such as Marburg or Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever are manipulated at BSL -4. The primary hazards to personnel working with BSL -4 agents are respiratory exposure to infectious aerosols, mucous membrane or broken skin exposure to infectious droplets, and autoinoculation. All manipulations of potentially infectious diagnostic materials, isolates, and naturally or experimentally infected animals, pose a high risk of exposure and infection to laboratory personnel, the community, and the environment. The laboratory worker's complete isolation from aerosolized infectious materials is accomplished primarily by working in a Class III BSC or in a full -body, air -supplied positive -pressure personnel suit. The BSL -4 facility itself is generally a separate building or completely isolated zone with complex, specialized ventilation requirements and waste management systems to prevent release of viable agents to the environment. The laboratory director is specifically and primarily responsible for the safe operation of the laboratory. His/her knowledge and judgment are critical in assessing risks and appropriately applying these recommendations. The recommended biosafety level represents those conditions under which the agent can ordinarily be safely handled. Special characteristics of the agen ts used, the training and experience of personnel, procedures being conducted and the nature or function of the laboratory may further influence the director in applying these recommendations. Animal Facilities Four standard biosafety levels are also described for activities involving infectious disease work with commonly used experimental animals. These four combinations of practices, safety equipment, and facilities are designated Animal Biosafety Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4, and provide increasing levels of protection to personnel and the environment. One additional biosafety level, designated BSL -3-Agriculture (or BSL 3 -Ag) addresses activities involving large or loose -housed animals and/or studies involving agents designated as High Consequence Pathogens by the USDA. BSL 3 -Ag laboratories are designed so that the laboratory facility itself acts as a primary barrier to prevent release of infectious agents into the environment. More information on the design and operation of BSL 3-Ag facilities and USDA Hig h Consequence Pathogens is provided in Appendix D. Clinical Laboratories Clinical laboratories, especially those in health care facilities, receive clinical specimens with requests for a variety of diagnostic and clinical support services. Typically, the i nfectious nature of clinical material is unknown, and specimens are often submitted with a broad request for microbiological examination for multiple agents (e.g., sputa submitted for \"routine,\" acid -fast, and fungal cultures). It is the responsibility of the laboratory director to establish standard procedures in the laboratory that realistically address the issue of the infective hazard of clinical specimens. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 A-5 Except in extraordinary circumstances (e.g., suspected hemorrhagic fever), the initial processing of clinical specimens and serological identification of isolates can be done safely at BSL -2, the recommended level for work with bloodborne pathogens such as HBV and HIV. The containment elements described in BSL - 2 are consistent with the OSHA standard, \"Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens.2,3 This requires the use of specific precautions with all clinical specimens of blood or other potentially infectious material (Universal or Standard* Precautions).4,5 Additionally, other recommendations spec ific for clinical laboratories may be obtained from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly known as the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards). 6 BSL-2 recommendations and OSHA requirements focus on the prevention of percutaneous and mucous membrane exposures to clinical material. Primary barriers such as BSCs (Class I or II) should be used when performing procedures that might cause splashing, spraying, or splattering of droplets. Biological safety cabinets also should be used for the initial processing of clinical specimens when the nature of the test requested or other information suggests the likely presence of an agent readily transmissible by infectious aerosols (e.g., M. tuberculosis), or when the use of a BSC (Class II) i s indicated to protect the integrity of the specimen. The segregation of clinical laboratory functions and limited or restricted access to such areas is the responsibility of the laboratory director. It is also the director's responsibility to establish standard, written procedures that address the potential hazards and the required precautions to be implemented. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 B-1 Appendix B Classification of Human Eti ologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard This section has been reprinted from the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (N IH Guidelines) , April 2019 . This appendix includes those biological agents known to infect humans as well as selected animal agents that may pose theoretical risks if inoculated into humans. Included are lists of representative genera and species known to be pathogenic; mutated, recombined, and non-pathogenic species and strains are not considered. Non -infectious life cycle stages of parasites are excluded. This appendix reflects the current state of knowledge and should be considered a resource document. Included are the more commonly encountered agents and is not meant to be all -inclusive. Information on agent risk assessment may be found in the Agent Summary Statements of the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (see Sections V-C, V -D, V-E, and V -F, Footnotes and References of Sections I through IV .

Appendix B - Table 1. Basis for the Classification of Biohazardous Agents by Risk Group (RG) Risk Group 1 (RG1) Agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans Risk Group 2 (RG2) Agents that are associated with human disease which is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available Risk Group 3 (RG3) Agents that are associated with serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available (high individual risk but low community risk) Risk Group 4 (RG4) Agents that are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available (high individual risk and high community risk) Appendix B -I. Risk Group 1 (RG1) Agents RG1 agents are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans. Examples of RG1 agents include asporogenic Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus licheniformis (see Appendix C -IV-A , Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus licheniformis Host -Vector Systems, Exceptions); adeno - associated virus (AAV - all serotypes); and recombinant or synthetic AAV constructs, in which the transgene does not encode either a potentially tumorigenic gene product or a toxin molecule and are produced in the a bsence of a helper virus. A strain of Escherichia coli (see Appendix C -II-A, Escherichia coli K -12 Host Vector Systems, Exceptions) is an RG1 agent if it (1) does not possess a complete lipopolysaccharide ( i.e., lacks the O antigen); and (2) does not carry any active virulence factor ( e.g., toxins) or colonization factors and does not carry any genes encoding these factors. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 B-2 Those agents not listed in Risk Groups (RGs) 2, 3 and 4 are not automatically or implicitly classified in RG1; a risk assessment must be conducted based on the known and potential properties of the agents and their relationship to agents that are listed.

Animal Viral Etiologic Agents in Common Use The followin g list of animal etiologic agents is appended to the list of human etiologic agents. None of these agents is associated with disease in healthy adult humans; they are commonly used in laboratory experimental work. A containment level appropriate for RG1 human agents is recommended for their use. For agents that are infectious to human cells, e.g., amphotropic and xenotropic strains of murine leukemia virus, a containment level appropriate for RG2 human is recommended. virus 40 Murine retroviral vectors to be used for human transfer experiments (less than 10 liters) that contain less than 50% of their respective parental viral genome and that have been demonstrated to be free of detectable repli cation competent retrovirus can be maintained, handled, and administered, under BL1 containment. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 C-1 Appendix C BSL2 + Work Practices Biosafety Level 2 Plus ( BSL2 +) is the designation utilized for those biohazard experiments that require practices that are more stringent than standard BSL2 procedures. Generally, BL3 practices are mandated in a space designed for BSL2 work. It is preferred that t he BSL2 laboratory be self -contained; that is, all equipment required for the experiment should be located within the lab. A sign is posted on the door while BSL2 + work is in progress, and access is restricted to those involved in the experiment. When wo rk is completed, and equipment has been decontaminated, the sign is removed and the lab returns to standard BSL2 or BSL1 usage. BL3 practices require that all work be conducted under physical containment. Therefore, all manipulations with BSL2 + material are conducted within a Class II biological safety cabinet and secondary containment is utilized for centrifugation and other potential aerosol generating procedures. The following notes further describe the requirements for work at BSL2 +. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Dedicate PPE for the experiment. PPE worn for BSL2 + work should not be worn in other areas. Remove before leaving the laboratory. Wear a lab coat or solid -front gown, preferably with a knit or grip cuff. Double glove for all work within the biological safety cabinet (BSC). Remove the outer pair before exiting the BSC and don a new pair each time you reenter the BSC. Ensure that your gloves extend over the sleeve of your lab coat. An opening at the wrist will allow aerosols generated within the BSC to contaminate your wrist and forearm, extending hand -washing to your elbow. Sleeve covers can be worn to ensure coverage of the wrist and will also minimize contamination of the sleeves of your lab coat. Face P rotection (mask and eyewear, can also be worn and will protect mucous membranes from exposure in the event a spill outside the BSC during transfer of material to and from the incubator. It will also help to prevent you from touching your eyes, nose and mouth when working within the BSC. Remove PPE before leaving the laboratory. Placing a coat hook within the BSL2 + area will facilitate this requirement. Remove your outer gloves first, then your lab coat or gown, followed by the inner gloves. Take your fa ce protection off last. Don't touch your face with gloved hands. Remove gloves and other clothing aseptically, from the inside out, and avoid touching the contaminated outer side of the glove. Decontaminate reusable PPE as soon as feasible after it has b een contaminated. Small areas can be spot treated with a suitable disinfectant, such as 1 -10% household bleach. Lab coats can also be autoclaved or sent to a laundry facility equipped to handle biohazardous PPE. Disposable PPE can be placed within a bio hazard bag, treated and discarded as biomedical waste. Wash your hands with soap and water after removing PPE and before leaving the laboratory. Work Practices in the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) Perform all work within a BSC. This includes discarding waste within the BSC. Moving your hands in and out of the BSC will disrupt the protective air curtain at the front access opening. Place all items required for the experiment within the BSC before starting work. Wipe items down with disinfectant prior to placement within the BSC. Segregate clean areas from contaminated areas within the BSC (by at least 12 -14\"). Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 C-2 Keep the front and rear grilles clear when working within the BSC. Avoid blocking the rear grille. Don't store items on top of the BSC. Remind fellow researchers to minimize traffic and work behind the operator, as this may interfere with cabinet airflow. Depending on the location of the BSC within the room, opening and closing the room door can significantly interfere with BSC airflow . Avoid t he use of a flame within the BSC. In addition to presenting a fire hazard, an open flame can disrupt airflow and possibly damage the paper filter located above the work surface. If the use of flame is absolutely necessary, use a burner with a pilot light that provides a flame only when depressed and releases after contact. Never leave an open flame (burner or pilot light) unattended in your BSC. Store tissue culture flasks in the incubator within small secondary trays to help minimize contamination. Tra ys will also facilitate transfer to and from the BSC. Keep your hands away from your face (face protection helps to minimize the potential for this route of exposure). Avoid the use of glass Pasteur pipettes or needles and syringes. Substitute plastic for glass whenever feasible. Alternatives to glass Pasteur pipettes include: plastic pipettes, plastic transfer pipettes, pipette tips and pipette tip extenders, aspirators, and flexible plastic aspiration pipettes. Some researchers will either score and break the end off of a 1 ml or 5 ml plastic pipette or remove the wool plug and use for aspirating cultures. If the use of sharps cannot be avoided, maintain a sharps container in the immediate vicinity of use. Discard intact needles and syringes immediately after use. Use a one-handed disposal method (keep a hand behind your back or by your side, don't place on or near the opening of the sharps container). Never recap, bend, break or otherwise manipulate sharps by hand. If you must re move the needle from the syringe, use the small opening on the top of the needle box for this purpose. Forceps, tweezers, or small pliers may also be utilized. Protect the house vacuum system or pump from contamination by installing a trap and filter syst em. Use a primary collection flask containing disinfectant, followed by an overflow flask, which leads through a HEPA or hydrophobic filter. Please see the Vacuum System Protection Handout. Vacuum filters are available in the Medical School Stockroom, S HM IE -7. Collect all waste within the BSC. Smaller biohazard waste bags may be utilized along with beakers or shallow trays containing disinfectant for the collection and disinfection of pipettes and other contaminated items. Waste can also be collected within the BSC in the following manner : o Horizontal collection: Horizontal trays containing disinfectant allow total immersion of pipettes. o Vertical collection: Beakers containing disinfectant can be used if disinfectant is drawn up inside the pipette and allowed to run down the interior wall upon disposal into the beaker. o Bags: Bags have the potential for creating aerosols when moved. At BSL2 +, seal autoclave bags within the cabinet and place within a second bag. Carefully add water to the primary bag b efore sealing (25 ml for smaller bags, 200 ml for larger bags). The addition of water will help to generate steam within the bag during the autoclave cycle. Wipe items down with disinfectant prior to removal from the BSC. Wipe down BSC with disinfectant after use (work surface, grilles, sides, back and inside front view screen). Decontaminate liquid waste with household bleach diluted 10% against the volume of the waste. Allow at least a 30-minute contact time for full decontamination. Transport waste t o autoclave in a leakproof container. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 C-3 Centrifugation Use sealed rotors or safety buckets as secondary containment for centrifugation. Load and unload the rotor or safety buckets within the BSC. Don't overfill primary containers, limit to < \u00be full. Wipe ex terior of tube with disinfectant before loading. Seal rotor or bucket and wipe down with disinfectant, remove outer gloves, and transport to the centrifuge. Post a sign on centrifuge that includes the biohazard symbol, name of the agent with Biosafety Level, and your name. Wait 2 -5 minutes after the run to allow aerosols to settle in the event of a spill. Transport sealed rotor or safety bucket to cabinet to complete your experiment. Don new pair of outer gloves. Decontaminate the rotor or safety bucket b y spraying with 70% ethanol and allowing to air dry. Wipe the throw line within the centrifuge with disinfectant and remove your biohazard sign. In the event of a spill during centrifugation, follow the spill response procedures outlined in the Biosafety Spill Response Guide. Avoid the use of microfuge, which is difficult to contain. If you cannot avoid using a microfuge, use a model that has built in secondary containment (a sealed rotor) along with microfuge tubes equipped with an O-ring seal. You can also operate your microfuge in the rear of your BSC (don't perform any work within the BSC while the microfuge is in operation and wait 2 -5 minutes after the run before opening the microfuge). Labels Post a biohazard sign at the entry to the BSL2 + laborat ory. Ensure that any specific entry requirements (vaccination), the name of the agent, the Biosafety Level, and the name of an emergency contact person ARE posted on either the sign or the Laboratory Information Card. Place the BSL2 wall notice (not a do or sign) inside your laboratory to remind researchers of the core safety practices. Label equipment housing the agent (incubators, freezers) with the universal biohazard symbol and agent name. Transport of Biohazards on Campus (between labs or buildings): Must have two leakproof containers, including the following: o a sealed primary container o a sealed secondary container o absorbent (paper towels) between the primary and secondary containers suitable for the volume transported a biohazard sticker on the outsid e of the secondary container with agent name lab address and phone number on the outside of the secondary container Utilize plastic containers whenever feasible; avoid glass. Sealed plastic (not glass) primary vials can be transported within sealed, labeled plastic bags. If glass primary containers must be used, place containers within a sealed rigid plastic container with absorbent and padding to cushion vials during transport. Decontaminated the outside of the primary container before placing it into the secondary container. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 C-4 Decontaminate the secondary container before leaving the laboratory. Research materials may not be transported on any of the Yale shuttles, public transportation, or in personal vehicles. Please contact EHS if you need to transport materials between Yale campuses. Hand -washing Wash hands whenever PPE is removed and before leaving the laboratory. Wash with soap and warm water for at least 15 seconds. Since the contact time of most soaps is quite extensive for actual decontaminat ion, mechanical friction from scrubbing and water dilution are essential for complete cleaning. No glove is 100% leakproof. Never wet or handwash your gloves with water or disinfectant, as this will encourage wicking and increase permeability of the protective barrier. Spills and Exposure Incidents All researchers must be familiar with the applicable exposure response procedures before initiating their experiments. Review th e attached Biosafety Spill and Incident Response Guide before starting work.

HGT is the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA, into human subjects. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) forma l definition of HGT is provided in the next paragraph. This document outlines the Yale University Biological Safety Committee (Committee) requirements for HGT protocols. Additional federal requirements (NIH and United States Food and Drug Administration) for these experiments are described in Section III -C of the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines), April 2019, and in the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR, Part 312 (FDA Points to Consider). NIH Definition of Human Gene Transfer Research (HGT) and Exemptions NIH Definition of Human Gene Transfer Research (HGT) Section III- C-1. Experiments Involving the Deliberate Transfer of Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or DNA or RNA Derived from Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, into One or More Human Research Participants. Human gene transfer is the deliberate transfer into human research participants of either: 1. Recombinant nucleic acid molecules, or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant nucleic acid molecules, or 2. Synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or 3. DNA or RNA derived from synthetic nucleic acid molecules that meet any one of the following criteria: a. Contain more than 100 nucleotides; or b. Possess biological properties that enable integration into the genome ( e.g., cis elements involved in integration); or c. Have the potential to replicate in a cell; or d. Can be trans lated or transcribed Expanded Access Exemption The deliberate transfer of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acids into one human research participant, conducted under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated individual patient expanded access Investig ational New Drug (IND) or protocol, including for emergency use, is not research subject to the NIH Guidelines and thus does not need to be submitted to an IBC for review and approval. These protocols still require registration with the Yale Human Investi gation Committee. Treatment Exemption If the use of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules is for \"treatment\", such as used in an emergency IND, review by the Yale Biological Safety Committee would not be required. Only protocols involving recomb inant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules in human subjects classified as \"research\" require Committee review and authorization prior to initiation. These protocols still require registration with the Yale Human Investigation Committee. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 F-3 On Campus Registrations and Approvals It is recommended that HGT registrations or notifications are pursued in the following order: A. Notification to Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) Hospital Epidemiology and YNHH Occupational Health of the request to conduct a HGT protocol at the YNHH. It is preferred that the Principal Investigator invite the Sponsor to YNHH to provide a presentation on the description of the proposed project for representatives of these two groups AND representatives from all groups who may participate in the project, especially if any hazards are involved. This would include the pharmacists who will handle and prepare the study drug for administration, the physicians and nurses who will have to deliver the study drug, and any other healthcare workers who wil l work with study subjects. i. It is imperative that the Principal Investigator or Department confirm that there is a sufficient number of personnel from the groups above (pharmacists, nurses, doctors, and other health care providers) willing to participate in the protocol prior to registration with the following campus groups. ii. Verification that personnel will participate on the project is required prior to the initiation of review of the protocol by the Yale Biological Safety Committee. B. Registration with the Yale Biological Safety Committee and the Committee's Human Gene Transfer Subcommittee General registrations must be received by the Biological Safety Committee by the 1st Thursday of each month, to have an opportunity to be reviewed by the Committee a t the monthly meeting on the 3rd Thursday of each month. As these protocols are usually more complex than a standard recombinant DNA project that does not involve human subjects, the \"best\" day to submit a Human Gene Transfer Protocol is on the 3rd Thursd ay of the month. This will guarantee the \"longest\" time in between monthly Committee meetings to allow sufficient time for review. C.

Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 F-13 Pathway for human gene transfer (HGT) protocols at Yale University 1. If the protocol will be conducted at YNHH and involves hazards, the Principal Investigator must notify YNHH Hospital Epidemiology/Infection Prevention and YNHH Occupational Health for additional review and information. 2. The Sponsor conducts an introductory meeting with the Principal Investigator and all possibl e healthcare workers, including pharmacy staff, who may participate in the project. The presentation covers the rational for the project and any hazards involved for the subjects and healthcare workers. 3. The Principal Investigator verifies that there is sufficient staffing after the Sponsor's presentation to participate in all required aspects of the study. 4. Principal Investigator submits the required documentation listed above (pages 7 - 12) to the Yale Biological Safety Committee. 5. The EHS Biosafety Offic e verifies that all documentation has been received and submits the complete protocol to members of the Yale Biological Safety Committee's HGT Subcommittee. 6. If needed, an HGT Subcommittee meeting is scheduled with the Principal Investigator and technical r epresentatives from the Sponsor who are familiar with the recombinant molecules utilized in the protocol. Sponsor representatives generally participate by teleconference at the live HGT meeting. HGT Subcommittee meetings are scheduled as needed and meeti ng dates are coordinated with HGT Subcommittee members and representatives from the Principal Investigator's research team. 7. The chair of the HGT Subcommittee, or designee, will provide the recommendation of the HGT Subcommittee on the protocol to the Yale Biological Safety Committee. 8. The Yale Biological Safety Committee will review the recommendations from the HGT Subcommittee and will vote on the protocol. Yale Biological Safety Committee meetings are usually held monthly on the third Thursday of the mont h. 9. The results of the Yale Biological Safety Committee review are communicated to the Principal Investigator and the Yale Human Investigation Committee. If approved, the Principal Investigator will receive an approval letter for the protocol from the Yale Biological Safety Committee. 10. Principal Investigator submits a registration for conducting research involving human subjects to the Yale Human Investigation Committee. 11. The Yale Human Investigation Committee will complete its review of the project. If appr oved, the Principal Investigator will receive an approval letter from the Human Investigation Committee. 12. For protocols being conducted at the Yale New Haven Hospital: Once the Principal Investigator receives approvals from both Committees (the Biological Safety Committee and the Human Investigation Committee), the Principal investigator must contact the Yale New Haven Hospital Infection Control Committee to set up a protocol review meeting prior to the initiation of the protocol. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 F-14 Adverse Events and Reporting Requirements Unintended Consequences Among Staff If a clinical study team member experiences an exposure, injury, or infection related to their participation in the study, this must be reported to both the Yale Biological Safety Committee and the Yale Human Investigation Committee. Each Committee has subsequent reporting requirements to their respective federal agencies (NIH Office of Science Pol icy and the FDA). Adverse Events Experienced by Study Subjects All adverse events must be reported in an annual data summary that is prepared for the Yale HIC, the Yale Biological Safety Committee, the FDA, and the sponsor. Any Serious Adverse Events (SAE 's) must be reported by telephone (to who?) within 24 hours followed by a written report within 10 days. This report must be on file with the Yale HIC, the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee, and the FDA within 15 days. Please note that SAE's must be reported whether related to the protocol or not. SAE's shall not be designated as confidential, either in whole or in part, and the SAE reports shall be stripped of patient identifiers, such as name, address, contact information, social security number, and dat e of birth. If the SAE occurs after the trial and deemed related to the HGT trial, it must be reported within 15 days of the date of determination. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 F-15 April 2019 Yale and NIH Points to Consider for the IBC Review of Human Gene Transfer Protocols The following documentation must be submitted to the Yale Institutional Biological Safety Committee to initiate the review of an HGT protocol. A scientific abstract as provided in (Principal) Investigator's Brochure The proposed clinical protocol, including tables, figures, and any relevant publications Ensure that the information described in the bulleted list below is included in the materials submitted to the Committee. The information may be described in the Clinical Study Protocol or the Investigator's Brochure. If not, please provide the informati on in a separate document. Summary of preclinical studies conducted in support of the proposed clinical trial or reference to the specific section of the protocol providing this information. Product description, for instance: Derivation of the delivery v ector system including the source (e.g., viral, bacterial, plasmid), associated modifications (i.e., deletions to attenuate or self -inactivate, encapsulation in any synthetic complex, changes to tropisms), and previous clinical experience with the system Genetic content of the transgene or nucleic acid delivered, including the species source of the sequence, and whether any modifications have been made (e.g., mutations, deletions, truncations) Any other material to be used in preparation of the agent (vec tor and transgene) to be administered to research participants (e.g., helper virus, packaging cell line, carrier particles) Methods for replication- competent virus testing Intended ex vivo or in vivo target cells and transduction efficiency Gene transfe r agent delivery method Note: Any application submitted shall not contain any document that is designated as 'confidential' in its entirety. If a determination has been made that a specific portion of a document should be considered proprietary or trade secret, each specific portion shall be clearly identified as such. If a specific portion of the submission is identified to be proprietary or trade secret, the submission to the Yale IBC must contain a letter that: (1) clearly indicates what select porti ons of the application contain information considered as proprietary or trade secret, and (2) provides justification as to why this information is proprietary or trade secret. The justification must be able to demonstrate with specificity how release of that information will reveal a trade secret or will result in substantial competitive harm. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 F-16 April 2019 Amendment of the NIH Guidelines - NIH Office of Science Policy This section provides many of the frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to human gene transfer from the NIH Office of Science Policy web site. Additional FAQs are available on the NIH Office of Science Policy web site at https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/faqs -on-the-nih-guidelines -research- synthetic-nucleic -acid -molecules/ . What specific changes have been made to the NIH Guidelines regarding human gene transfer (HGT) protocol submission and reporting requirements to NIH's Office of Science Policy (OSP)? Under the NIH Guidelines, individual HGT protocol submission and reporting to NIH/OSP are no longer required. Specifically, NIH/OSP will not: accept or register new HGT protocols; convene the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) to review individual HGT protocols; accept annual reports, safety reports, amendments or other documentation for any HGT protocols previously registered under the NIH Guidelines (formerly, Appendix MI -C). What changes have been made to the NIH Guidelines regarding the roles and responsibilities of releva nt entities? It is important to note that while NIH is streamlining individual human gene transfer (HGT) protocol reporting requirements, robust oversight over HGT research will continue through both Federal and local oversight bodies. The roles and responsibilities of investigators, institutions, and oversight bodies involved in HGT research remain the same, except: The roles of Institutional Biosafety Committees in reviewing HGT research have been modified to be consistent with the review of other research covered by the NIH Guidelines. Principal Investigators (PIs) will no longer be responsible for ensuring requirements for protocol submission, review, and reporting for HGT protocols to NIH's Office of Science Policy are addressed, since these responsibilities have be en eliminated. All other roles and responsibilities for PIs will remain the same. Because the Novel and Exceptional Technology and Research Advisory Committee (NExTRAC) will now focus on advising the NIH Director on scientific, safety, and ethical issues a ssociated with emerging biotechnologies (which is not necessarily limited to recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research), non -historical references to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee will be removed from the NIH Guidelines. The roles an d responsibilities will be delineated in the charter, as is typical for such committees. Is human gene transfer (HGT) research still covered under the NIH Guidelines ? What is required before a Principal Investigator or sponsor can initiate HGT research and begin enrollment/recruitment/accrual? Yes. When conducted by an entity subject to the NIH Guidelines (see Section I -C), HGT research (see Section III -C) is still covered, as protocols must still be reviewed and approved by Institutional Biosafety Committe es to assess biosafety considerations at the clinical trial site. In addition, all other applicable institutional and regulatory authorization(s) and approvals must be obtained before any research with human participants can be initiated. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 F-17 If human gene transfer (HGT) protocols are no longer registered with NIH's Office of Science Policy (OSP), will sites conducting only HGT research still need to register their Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) with NIH/OSP? Yes. All entities conducting research subject to the NIH Guidelines, including HGT research, must have an appropriately constituted IBC registered with NIH/OSP. For additional information on registering an IBC, see Section IV -B-2 of the NIH Guidelines and on the NIH/OSP website: https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/faqs -on-ibc-administration/ . Is human gene transfer research conducted under Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated individual patient expanded access Investigational New Drug (IND) applications subject to the NIH Guidelines ? No. The deliberate transfer of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acids into one human research participant, conducted under an FDA -regulated individual patient expanded access IND or protocol, including for emergency use, is not research subject to the NIH Guidelines and thus, does not need to be submitted to an Institutional Biosafety Committee for review and approval. Specific guidance regarding FDA requirements is provided (IBCs) be required to change their rev iew processes? What aspects of human gene transfer (HGT) research should IBCs focus on? The focus of the IBC review of HGT research should be equivalent to their review of the biosafety aspects of other covered research, e.g.: required containment levels potential for shedding safety and training of laboratory/technical personnel involved in the clinical protocol details of the facilities adequacy and maintenance of safety equipment that may be used in support of the clinical protocol safety procedures and practices when working with the product and during administration to a protocol participant reporting of biosafety accidents and incidents occurring during conduct of the protocol approving emergency response plans for accidental spills and personnel contamination As with other research reviewed by IBCs, IBCs should determine what information they require to complete their biosafety review of HGT protocols. IBC oversight may conclude after the last participant is administered the final dose of product. However, IBCs may choose to establish other end points for oversight, based on their biosafety assessment of the proposed research. Other aspects of HGT research, such as review of informed consent, are under the purview of the Food and Drug Administration and Institutional Review Boards. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 F-18 Should biosafety incidents occurring during the conduct of human gene transfer (HGT) research still be reported to NIH's Office of Science Policy (OSP)? Yes. The NIH Guidelines require that \"...any sig nificant problems, violations of the NIH Guidelines , or any significant research -related accidents and illnesses\" be reported to NIH. Reports of incidents can be emailed to NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov . Relevant incidents would include spills and accidents that result in overt exposures to organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules in the laboratory, rather than serious adverse events that may occur in the conduct of HGT research. Additio nal information on incident reporting and a reporting template are available on the NIH/OSP website at https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/nih- guidelines/ Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 F-19 March 2013 Changes to the NIH Guidelines (Addressing Synthetic Biology) In March 2013, the NIH Guidelines will have a new title, the \"NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules\". Even with a new title, the docu ment is still referenced as the \"NIH Guidelines.\" The change was made to keep pace with rapid technological advancements in synthetic biology. The NIH Guidelines were expanded to include new language to address nucleic acid molecules created solely by syn thetic means, and will include: Recombinant nucleic acid molecules; Synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including those that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules; and Cells, organisms, and viruses containing such molecules. The phrase \"recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules\" replaced the term \"recombinant DNA molecules\" throughout the text of the NIH Guidelines. Updated definition for recombinant and synthetic nucleic acid molecules: (i) Molecules that a) are constructed by joining nucleic acid molecules and b) can replicate in a living cell (i.e. recombinant nucleic acids); (ii) Nucleic acid molecules that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules (i.e. synthetic nucleic acids); or (iii) Molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) or (ii) above. HGT Synthetic Nucleic Acid Experiments that are covered by the Guidelines: Human gene transfer (HGT) experiments with synthetic nucleic acid molecules if any of the following criteria are met: The synthetic nucleic acid molecules: Contains more than 100 nucleotides; or Possess biological properties that enable integration into the genome (e.g. cis elements involved in in tegration); or Have the potential to replicate in a cell; or Can be translated or transcribed. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 F-20 Standard Approval Letter Language from the Yale Biological Safety Committee for Human Gene Transfer (HGT) Protocols The application was approved at Biosafety Level 2 containment (Standard and Universal Precautions) and sharps precautions for inoculating patients with the study drug, with the following additional requirements: The protocol also has the following additional requirements: IRB Approval L etter. Please send the Yale IBC a copy of the current IRB Approval Letter for your IBC protocol file. Documentation of a start- up discussion of this protocol with representatives from YNHH that may include: nursing staff involved in the project, YNHH Oc cupational Health and Safety, YNHH Epidemiology and Infection Control, YNHH and/or Smilow Pharmacy, the research study team, and a patient advocate representative. Please contact Dr. Richard Martinello, Medical Director, Hospital Epidemiology and Infectio n Control at 203 -688- 4634 for the specific groups required to attend the start- up meeting for your protocol. You cannot begin the protocol until this start -up meeting is documented with YNHH Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control. Any serious event that is both unexpected and associated with the use of the gene transfer product (i.e. there is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused using the product) must be reported to the IRB of Record within 48 hours. A copy of the FDA IND authorization email accepting the initiation of the trial at Yale must be on file with the Yale IBC prior to the enrollment of patients in the trial. A copy of the latest version of your FDA -authorized protocol. If relevant, please describe any substantive differences between your current protocol and the protocol registered with the Yale IBC and approved by the FDA. A copy of the annual report to the FDA and the IRB must also be submitted to the Yale IBC for the protocol file. The Yale IB C approval of your protocol will expire on the expiration date of the IRB protocol as reflected in the IRB approval letter. The IBC re -approval is contingent on the re -approval by the IRB of record. The protocol must be re -approved by the IRB of record a t least annually. Should you wish to add personnel to your project, change the scope or location of your work, you must notify the Biosafety Office. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to train new personnel before they begin work. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 F-21 Annual Reporting Requirements for Principal Investigators with Active Human Gene Transfer (HGT) Protocols By the one -year anniversary of the approval date of a HGT Protocol, Principal Investigators must provide the Yale EHS Biosafety Office w ith an annual report that includes the following information. 1. Verification that the protocol is still active. 2. The date of the last Yale Human Investigation Committee authorization (annual HIC authorization is required for the continuation of an HGT Protoco l). 3. For protocols that have been activated, a report that includes the number of subjects enrolled since the protocol has been initiated. a. This report must also include a summary of all adverse and serious adverse events reported for each enrolled patient i n the last year identified by your team, another institution or the Sponsor. b. You may also provide the EHS Biosafety Office with an annual report from the Sponsor that includes this information. 4. Verification that each batch of the study drug shipped to Yale for use has been tested for adventitious agents and if applicable replication competent vectors. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 G-1 Appendix G Sources of Contamination If contamination is experienced in the laboratory, the following items may be sources of the contamination . For additional assistance please contact the Biosafety Office at 785 -3550. Personal items, such as coats, hats, storm rubbers or overshoes, umbrellas, purses, etc., do not belong in the laboratory. These articles should be stored elsewhere. Nonspecific contamination by environmental organisms from humans, animals, equipment, containers for specimens or supplies, and outside air is a complication that may affect or invalidate the results of an experiment. Human sources of this type of contamination are evaluated as follows: Sneezing, coughing and talking. Sneezing, variously reported to generate as many as 32,000 or 1,000,000 droplets below 100 microns in diameter; coughing, which produces fewer and larger droplets; and talking, which has been reported to average only 250 droplets when speaking 100 words, show great differences between persons in regard to the number of microorganisms aerosolized. As a general rule, it may be said that these actions by normal healthy persons may play a less important ro le in transmission of airborne infection to humans or experimental materials than does liberation of microorganisms from human skin. Dispersal of bacteria from human skin. There is a tremendous variation in the number of bacteria shed from the skin by a c lothed subject. For instance, in one study, the number varied from 6,000 to 60,000 per minute. These bacteria were released on skin scales of a size that could penetrate the coarse fabric used for the laboratory and surgical clothing in the test. Disper sal of skin bacteria was several times greater from the area below the waist than from upper parts of the body. Effective reduction is accomplished by use of closely -woven or impervious clothing fitted tightly at the neck, wrists, and ankles to prevent th e clothing from acting as bellows that disperses air carrying skin scales laden with bacteria. Such clothing sometimes is too warm to work in. The purpose of this summary is to alert laboratory personnel to the existence of this source of contamination. Prolific dispersal of bacteria occurs from infected abrasions, small pustules, boils, and skin disease. Washing of lesions with germicidal soap will greatly decrease the number of organisms on the skin and dispersal into the air. Healthy nasal carriers who generate aerosolized staphylococci usually can be identified by the presence of heavy contamination of their fingers, face, and hair. This point may be useful in investigating the source of staphylococcal contamination of cell lines. Footwear. In mode rate and high -risk situations, shoes reserved only for laboratory use have been recommended as a precaution against transporting spilled infectious agents outside the laboratory. In experiments during which reduction of potential contamination of experime ntal materials is important, laboratory -only shoes can also reduce the microbial load brought into the laboratory each day by street shoes. Shoes are efficient transporters. In one study, there were 4 to 850 times as many bacteria per square centimeter o n the laboratory footwear as on the floor itself. Personal Work Practices Food, candy, gum, and beverages for human consumption will be stored and consumed only outside the laboratory. Smoking is not permitted in the laboratory or Yale University buildings . Shaving and brushing of teeth are not permitted in the laboratory. Razors, toothbrushes, toiletry supplies and cosmetics are permissible only in clean areas, and should never be used until after showering or thorough washing of the face and hands. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 G-2 A beard may be undesirable in the laboratory in the presence of actual or potential airborne contamination, because it retains particulate contamination more persistently than clean -shaven skin. A clean -shaven face is essential to the adequate facial fit of a facemask or respirator when the work requires respiratory protection. Develop the habit of keeping hands away from mouth, nose, eyes, face and hair. This may prevent self-inoculation. For product protection, person with long hair should wear a suitable ha ir net or head cover that can be decontaminated. This has long been a requirement in hospital operating rooms and in facilities where biological pharmaceutical products are manufactured. A head cover also will protect the hair from fluids, splashes, from swinging into Bunsen burner flames and Petri dishes, as well as reduce facial contamination caused by habitual repetitive manual adjustment of the hair. Long flowing hair and loose flapping clothing are dangerous in the presence of open flame or moving machinery. Rings and wristwatches also are a mechanical hazard during operation of some types of machines. Contact lenses do not provide eye protection. The capillary space between the contact lenses and the cornea may trap any material present on the surf ace of the eye. Caustic chemicals trapped in this space cannot be washed off the surface of the cornea. If the material in the eye is painful or the contact lens is displaced, muscle spasms will make it very difficult, if not impossible, to remove the lens. For this reason, contact lenses must not be worn by persons exposed to caustic chemicals unless safety glasses with side shields, goggles or full face shield are worn to provide full protection. Plants, cut flowers, an aquarium, and pets of any kind a re undesirable sources of yeast, molds and other potential microbial contaminants of biological experimental materials. Books and journals returnable to the institutional library should be used only in the clean areas as much as possible. When change rooms with showers are provided, the employer should furnish skin lotion. When employees are subject to potential occupational infection, the shower and/ or face/hand - washing facilities should be provided with germicidal soap. Personal cloth handkerchiefs shoul d not be used in the laboratory. Disposable cleansing tissues should be available for use instead. Hand washing for personal protection: This should be done promptly after removing protective gloves. Tests show it is not unusual for microbial or chemical contamination to be present despite use of gloves, due to unrecognized small holes, abrasions, tears, or entry at the wrist. Throughout the day, at intervals dictated by the nature of the work, the hands should be washed. Presence of a wristwatch discour ages adequate washing of the wrist. Hands should be washed after removing soiled protective clothing, before leaving the laboratory area, before eating and smoking. The provision of hand cream by the employer encourages this practice. A disinfectant wash or dip may be desirable in some cases, but its use must not be carried to the point of causing roughening, desiccation or sensitization of the skin. Anyone with a fresh or healing cut, abrasion, or skin lesion should not work with infectious materials unless the injured area is completely protected, such as with waterproof bandages and double gloving. Persons vaccinated for smallpox may shed vaccinia virus during the phase of cutaneous reaction. Therefore, vaccination requires permission of the appropr iate supervisor, because two weeks Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 G-3 absence may be necessary before returning to work with normal cell cultures or with susceptible animals, such as the normal mouse colony. Use of surgeon's mask of gauze or filter paper is of little value for personal resp iratory protection. It is designed to prevent escape of droplets from the nose or mouth. If use of biohazards demands respiratory protection, contact the Biosafety Office for assistance. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 H-1 Appendix H Biomedical Waste A. Introduction You play an important role in Yale's medical waste program if you generate waste in a laboratory or clinical area. This guide will help you dispose of your medical waste in an easy and l egal manner. Our program is designed to protect the people who handle, transport and dispose of your waste. The program is also designed to protect the environment and minimize Yale's regulatory liability. Some people believe they can save money by working around this program. These attempts are counter -productive. They may place other people and the University at risk. The costs associated with one injury, or violation fines can easily exceed annual operational costs. We would much rather hear and con sider your suggestions for program improvement than have you implement unauthorized procedures. The Environmental Services Section is continually working behind the scenes to improve this program and to control its cost. Direct any questions or suggestions to the Medical Waste Supervisor at 785- 7585. Call if you have questions about unusual situations or anything not covered in this guide. Remember: Radioactive or hazardous chemical wastes shall be disposed of through the radioactive waste stream or the h azardous chemical waste stream respectively. Please note: Clean broken or unbroken graduate cylinders, Erlenmeyer flasks, and beakers can be disposed of through the general trash. Place the items in a cardboard box, seal it, and label it \"broken glass\". B. Medical Waste Management - Overview All medical waste must be contained in a sealed: beige sharps container, red sharps container, or orange autoclave bag You can minimize costs by filling these containers efficiently and following the instructions in this guide. Waste in all sharps containers and orange autoclave bags must be autoclaved or chemically disinfected before being placed in a box -bag unit. A box- bag unit consists of the white medical waste box and the intact red bag liner. Autoclaved contain ers and bags should be allowed to cool before being placed in a box -bag unit. Place all sharps containers and bags upright in the box- bag unit. This will help minimize leaks and spills during transport. When the box- bag unit is full, seal the red bag, attach an address label (available at the stockrooms), seal the box and apply a second address label to the outside of the box signing off in the location provided to indicate that the waste is packaged appropriately. Keep your box -bag units inside your la boratory. Compliance with fire codes and maintaining control of this special waste stream is very important. Call the Office of Environmental Health and Safety at 785 -3551 to have the sealed box- bag units removed. At the same time, they will deliver an equal number of empty box bag units so you have a continuous supply. Beige and red sharps containers, autoclave bags and box -bag units shall only be used for medical waste disposal. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 H-2 C. Ordering Procedures Extra box -bag units can be obtained from Custodia l Services at no cost to your laboratory. Call 785 -4757 in the medical school, and 432- 2780 in the central and science areas. Red sharps containers are delivered by the Environmental Services Section at no cost to your laboratory. Call 785- 7585 to place your order. Beige sharps containers are available at either the Medical School stockroom or Kline Biology Tower stockroom at no cost to your laboratory. Orange autoclave bags may be purchased at either the Medical School stockroom or Kline Biology Tower stockroom. D. Definition of Medical Waste Medical wastes are defined using the following criteria: 1. Waste Cultures and Stocks of Microorganisms or Etiologic Agents Including: a. Cultures and stocks of infectious agents or microorganisms from facilities assign ed to Biosafety Levels 1 through 3 ( BSL1 , BSL2 , BL3). b. Cultures of specimens from medical and pathological laboratories. c. Disposable containers, materials, and supplies that may have been contaminated during the manipulation of microbial cultures and stocks d. Wastes from the production of biologicals (including all tissue culture materials.) e. Live and attenuated vaccines. 2. Human Pathological Wastes Pathological waste pericardial fluids; and their respective containers. 3. Waste Human Blood and Blood Products and Their Containers Including: a. Waste human blood and blood products (e.g. blood plasma, platelets, red or white corpuscles, and other derived licensed products such as interferon, etc.) b. Items saturated or dripping with human blood or blood products. c. Items caked with dried human blood or blood products. d. Intravenous bags. 4. Used Sharps Waste This category includes used hypodermic needles, syringes (with or without the attached needles), Pasteur pipettes, disposable plastic pipettes, scalpel blades, razor blades, blood vials, test tubes, needles with attached tubing, broken plastic culture dish es, unbroken glass culture dishes, and other types of broken and unbroken glassware that were in contact with infectious material including microscope slides and coverslips. 5. Unused Sharps Waste Unused hypodermic needles, suture needles, syringes, and scalpel blades. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 H-3 6. Waste Animal Carcasses, Body Parts, and Bedding Animal wastes purposely infected or known to have been exposed to Class 1, 2 or 3 agents shall be autoclaved. Use the pre-existing disposal system implemented by the Animal Resource Center . Uninfected or \"clean\" animals shall be wrapped in a nondescript plastic bag and discarded into grey barrels in Animal Resource Center coolers. Do not wrap these animals in orange autoclave bags or red bags. Plastic garbage bags can be purchased at eith er the Medical School stockroom or Kline Biology Tower stockroom. 7. Isolation Wastes Isolation wastes are defined as biological wastes and discarded materials contaminated with blood, excretion, exudates, or secretions from humans or animals isolated due to infection with Class 4 microbial agents. If a human or animal is known to be infected with a Class 4 agent, contact the Biological Safety Officer (737 -5009) immediately. E. Look -Alike Waste Look-alike waste is not considered medical waste. Look -alike waste is plastic or glass labware, lab matting and gloves that have not been in contact with infectious material. Look -alike waste is disposed of through a separate waste stream and should not be placed in the medical waste stream. Items should be discard ed in a manner to prevent physical injury to those people handling the waste. Glass and items that are capable of puncturing bags should be placed in a plastic lined cardboard box. Do not autoclave or chemically decontaminate look-alike waste. All intrav ascular sharps are considered medical waste regardless of the presence of infectious material and must be discarded in beige sharps containers. Do not discard intravascular sharps in the look alike waste stream. F. Disposal Procedures 1. Sanitary Sewer The sanitary sewer was designed for the disposal of certain liquid wastes. Use of the sanitary sewer reduces the chance for leaks or spills during transport and reduces disposal costs. Waste microbiological liquid stocks (Class 1,2 and 3 agents) shall be au toclaved or chemically disinfected and poured down the drain whenever possible. Human blood and body fluids do not need to be disinfected before being poured down the drain. Remember to rinse the sink area afterward. Disinfect if necessary. 2. Beige Sharp s Containers Discard all intravascular sharps waste such as hypodermic needles, syringes (with/without the attached needles), scalpel blades, and suture needles in your beige container. You may also deposit any other type of sharps waste into this containe r. Autoclave or chemically decontaminate waste in the container. Place the decontaminated and drained container upright into your box -bag unit. 3. Red Sharps Containers Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 H-4 Do not discard needles, syringes or other intravascular sharps into a red bucket. It is illegal to do so. Discard all non -intravascular sharps waste such as: Pasteur pipettes, disposable plastic pipettes, blood vials, test tubes, glass culture dishes, microscope slides and c overslips, sharp broken plasticware and other types of broken or u nbroken glassware that may have been in contact with infectious material. Autoclave or chemically decontaminate waste in the container. Place the decontaminated and drained container upright into a box- bag unit. 4. Orange Autoclave Bags Place small volume pathological waste, empty intact plastic liquid waste containers (with a residual volume of less than 20 cubic centimeters); intact plastic blood containers (with a residual volume of less than 20 cubic centimeters); intact plastic disposable containers; all other non -sharp materials and supplies that may have been contaminated during the manipulation of microbial cultures and stocks; and non -sharp waste from the production of biologicals (including tissue culture materials) in the orange autoclave bag. Autoclave the orange bag before placing it upright in a box- bag unit. 5. Medical Waste Box -Bag Unit Place your decontaminated beige sharps containers, red sharps containers and orange autoclave bags upright into a box- bag unit G. Biological Decontamination P rocedures Sharps containers and orange autoclave bags shall be biologically decontaminated before being placed in a box- bag unit. Bleach Decontamination: Fill the sharps container with a 1:10 bleach dilution and allow to stand overnight. Invert the conta iner in a sink and drain off the bleach solution. Autoclaving is preferred: Do not autoclave hazardous chemicals. When autoclaving a red sharps container leave the cover open. Beige sharps containers can be closed before being autoclaved. Orange autocl ave bags should not be taped closed. State regulation requires autoclaves to be operated at 250 \u00b0F and 15 pounds per square inch pressure for 60 minutes. Drain excess liquid and allow to cool before placing container into a box -bag unit. H. Mixed Waste 1. Chemical Waste and Medical Waste Items contaminated with ethidium bromide, diaminobenzidine (DAB), phorbol, or phenol - chloroform mixtures should not be mixed with other medical waste. Segregate these items into a beige sharps container, red sharps container or orange autoclave bag and label accordingly. When the container is full, place it directly into a box -bag unit. Do not autoclave or bleach decontaminate. 2. Chemotherapy Waste and Medical Waste Items contaminated with trace amounts of a chemo therapeutic agent or empty stock bottles may be disposed of through the medical waste stream. \"Empty\" is defined as containing less than 3% by weight of the total capacity of the container. Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 H-5 Stock solutions of these chemicals and items that are heavily con taminated are disposed of through the Chemical Hazardous Waste Program. Call the Environmental Services Section (785-3551) for guidelines concerning the disposal of chemical hazardous waste. 3. Radioactive Waste and Medical Waste Radioactive sharps waste s hould be disposed of in the yellow sharps containers provided by the Environmental Services Section. Animal carcasses, tissue/parts, and excreta containing/contaminated with radioactive materials shall be disposed of according to Environmental Services Sec tion requirements. 4. Other Mixed Waste Issues If you have any questions regarding other mixed waste issues please call the Environmental Services Section (785 -3551). I. Needle Box Containers General Procedures All non -radioactive hypodermic needles, syringes (with or without the attached needles), and other intravascular sharps waste must be discarded into beige containers. Other non-radioactive sharps waste that was in contact with infectious agents or other biologicals may be deposited into beige containers . Containers may be used freestanding or wall mounted. Order containers and wall brackets through the Environmental Services Section (785-7585). In patient -care settings, containers shall be locked to wall brackets. Non-radioactive sharps waste shall be d eposited into the opening on the top of the container (The flap on top of the container is a lid - not a flipper). The clear top allows you to see when the container is full. Do not overfill container. Sharps containers shall not be left in hallways, stair wells, or used as door stops. Biological Decontamination All sharps containers shall be biologically decontaminated. CHEMICAL DECONTAMINATION: Sharps contaminated with ethidium bromide, diaminobenzidene phorbol or phenol -chloroform mixtures are already chemically decontaminted. Segregate these sharps into one container and label accordingly. Do not autoclave or bleach. BLEACH DECONTAMINATION: Fill the container with a 1:10 dilution of bleach. Push the flap on top of the container into the opening and past the first or second set of stops. Allow the bleach solution to stand in the container overnight. Invert the container in a sink to drain off the bleach solution. AUTOCLAVING IS PREFERRED: (Hazardous chemicals shall not be autoclaved). Push the flap on top of the container into the opening and past the first or second set of stops. Autoclave the container at 250\u00b0 F and 15 pounds per square inch of pressure for 60 minutes. Disposal Yale University Biosafety Manual - July 2020 H-6 After biological decontamination, place container upright into Medical Waste box -bag unit.

Centrifuge Safety Autoclave Safety Steam sterilization has been an indispensable tool in biological research since Pasteur's time. Despite this importance, many people are unaware of some basic autoclave operating procedures that can improve the quality of sterilization as well as reduce the risk of personal injury. Never autoclave nitrocellulose tubes - they can explode! Carefully prepare items for autoclavi ng. Loosely cover or cap containers to avoid over - pressurization. Keep loads small - overloading hinders steam penetration. Bags should be left partially open and should be contained within a tray. If time allows let the load cool before removing it from the autoclave. Otherwise, open the door about \u00bd inch and vent for 5-10 minutes before emptying autoclave. Wear shoes/sneakers, pants, lab coat, face shield, and long sleeved insulated gloves when operating an autoclave. A heavy, rubberized insulated apron is further recommended for those who autoclave frequently. Periodically verify autoclave effectiveness with biological and chemical indicators that are available from the Biosafety Office. If you experience any problems or unusual occurrences please repo rt them to your supervisor or manager, Building Operations Coordinator, or the Office of Environmental Health & Safety (785-3550). Toxins BSL2 Work Practices Label toxin work areas within lab Cover work surface with plastic -backed absorbent paper Avoid generating aerosols; handle the powdered form carefully Use a chemical fume hood or biosafety cabinet when feasible Avoid the use of needles or Pasteur pipettes Substitute plastic for glass wherever possible Decontaminate work surfaces with 5 -10% household bleach or 0.1N sodium hydroxide Treat liquid waste with 50% household bleach (soak overnight.) For T- 2 mycotoxin use a combination of 50% household bleach and 0.25N sodium hydroxide. Collect and autoclave waste at the end of the day Autoclave or chemically disinfect contaminated protective clothing before reuse Personal Hygiene Keep your hands away from your face Do not eat, drink, or smoke in the lab Do not mouth pipette Always wash hands after removing protective clothing and before leaving the lab Labels and Transport Post BSL2 biohazard sign at lab entry Restrict access to the lab Label equipment used with or storing toxins For transport, use sealed, unbreakable, leakproof containers with a biohazard label and full toxin name Protective Clothing Requirements Lab coat buttoned to the top with knit or grip cuffs, or use gloves that are long enough to cover the sleeves; a back - fastening gown is suitable; sleeve covers offer additional protection Gloves (consider double gloving) Face protection such as a face shield or safety glasses and a mask to cover the eyes, nose and mouth Dedicate protective clothing for work with toxins and do not wear outside the lab Avoid skin contact when removing gloves Work with Powdered Form of Toxin Carefully weigh and convert to aqueous form as soon as possible Store powdered form in an unbreakable secondary container labeled with the complete toxin name to identify the hazard Change gloves after handling powdered toxin being sure to avoid skin contact with the toxin while removing gloves; wash hands prior to donning new gloves Emergency Response Flush skin or eyes with running water for 15 minutes, notify PI immediately, seek medical assistance Follow BSL2 spill procedures: leave lab for 30 minutes, upon return, decontaminate spill with 25% household bleach solution for 30 minutes, collect and autocl ave waste Safe Working practices to minimize exposure via ingestion, inhalation, mucous membrane contact, and absorption or penetration through the skin.
