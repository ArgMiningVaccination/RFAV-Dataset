VERIFICATION OF STUD ENT IDENTITY (LAND -BASED AND ONLINE/DE) This policy helps to ensure that Mercy College of Ohio (\"the College\") operates in compliance with the provisions of the United States Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), Public Law 110 -315, concerning the verification of student identity in distance education. This p olicy applies to all credit -bearing distance education courses or programs offered by the College, beginning with the application for admission and continuing through to a student's graduation, transfer, or withdrawal from study. The purpose of this polic y is to ensure that the College operates in compliance with the provisions of the United States Federal Higher Enrollment Management 44 Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) concerning the verification of student identity in distance education. The College complies fully with the prov isions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. 1232g. This act protects the privacy of student information in distance education by requiring, with certain limited exceptions, that the student's consent must be obtained before disclosing any personally identifiable information in the student's education records. Verification of student identity is a standard of admission at the College. It is a required component of the admission process regardless of whether the class is in-seat or online/at -a- distance. The process for verification is as follows: 1. In-seat programs At New Student Orientation, admitted students must provide a phot ocopy of an active driver's license, state issued identification card, U.S. Military ID, or U.S. Passport, which will be placed in the student's file as verification of identification. 2. Online/At -A-Distance programs During the application process, prospective students must provide two forms of identification. a. A photocopy of an active driver's licens e, state issued identification card, U.S. Military ID, or U.S. Passport. b. Birth certificates, U.S. Military ID, U.S. Passport, utility bill for the student's current address and in the student's name, formal work identification badge, or active professional state licensure. These two items must be mailed to the Admission Department and will be placed in the student's file as verification of identification. In accordance with HEOA, an institution providing distance education must have safeguards to ensure verification of student identity after admission has occurred. HEOA requires institutions use one of three methods to remain compliant: 1. Provide students wi th a secure login and passcode; 2. Provide for proctored examinations ; and 3. Provide new or other technologies and practices that are effective in verifying student identification . Secure Login and Passcode All students (land -based and distance/online) at the College are provided a User ID for secure access to College systems. New land -based students obtain their Username and Student ID through the Student Record's Office at orientation. Online students rec eive a packet of information with their Username and Student ID. Students have the option to change their password upon entry into any or all of the three systems that are accessible to them: Empower, BrightSpace and/or email. Should the student forget t his password, the online Learning Management System (LMS), BrightSpace, will issue a password reset link to the email of record. Enrollment Management 45 Students are responsible for providing their complete and true identity information in any identification verification process . It is against College policy for a user to give someone his or her password or to allow others to use his or her accounts. In addition, BrightSpace is ISO 27001 certified and they take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized acces s to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where personal information is stored. (http://www.brightspace.com/legal/privacy/?_ga=1.20444017.831890859.1440002733 Phone Verification of Student Identity For students who call the College to conduct student business, identity is verified through a three step process: Students must verify birthdate. Students must verify address of record. Students must verify Student ID numb er. Proctored Examinations Proctored exams provide a point of contact with the student. Faculty who choose to use proctored exams must complete the Notification of Proctored Exam Form through the Distance Education Division. Individuals who serve as Exam Proctors are given a Proctor Welcome Packet containing instructions and a Proctor Questionnaire Form that they are required to complete. When an instructor requires a proctored exam, a student can either find an approved proctor (e.g., Locating a Proctor ) or take the exam at Mercy College where either the instructor or a Distance Education staff member will proctor the exam. Students taking the exam off -campus are required to complete the Student Request for Proctored Exam Form . Students are informed in the Locating a Proctor information sheet that they are responsible for any costs incurred at the proctor site. Students are required to show proof of identity with a State issued Phot o ID or Passport for any proctored exam. TRANSFER CREDIT POLICY The following is the process used to award transfer credit to a student who has applied for admission to the College. 1. The student submits all relevant officia l transcripts to the Admission Department for transfer credit consideration. A transcript is considered official when stamped with the official school seal, signed by the appropriate school official, and received in a sealed envelope from the originating institution. Faxed transcripts are not accepted as official transcript documents. In order for a transcript, sent by a third party electronically to be considered official, the College must be able to authenticate it by logging in with a Enrollment Management 46 password to extr act it. Documents sent electronically without authentication are not considered official. Questions pertaining to whether a transcript is official or not official must be directed to the Registrar. 2. Only official English language transcripts will be revie wed to determine which course(s) from previously attended educational institutions will transfer. Students who have a non-English transcript must have it evaluated by World Education Services (https://www.wes.org) before credits will be reviewed for trans fer. 3. Transfer credit is awarded based on a student's declared first major. Students with more than one program of study will not receive transfer credit for the second major until the first major is completed, the student makes the second major the first, or in the event the student completes the second major first, transfer credit would then be assigned the semester before completion. 4. To be considered for transfer credit, courses must appear on the transcript with a final grade from the original instituti on from which the course was taken. a. After the student is accepted for admission to Mercy College, the Student Records Office evaluates the transcript. b. The Student Records Office cross -references the current transfer credit list with the transcript and grants credit for equivalent coursework. c. If the Student Records Office cannot determine the equivalency, the appropriate Dean/Program Director will evaluate the course based on a review of the course syllabus, course description, and course catalog informa tion. 5. Previous coursework will be accepted as transfer credit, provided that: a. The credit was awarded by a post -secondary institution accredited by one of the six regional accrediting organizations. b. Courses must be completed with a grade of \"C\" (2.0) or b etter. c. Coursework from a post -secondary institution not accredited by one of the six regional accrediting organizations will be considered on an individual basis through course -to-course validation. Exceptions can be made by the Registrar in consultation with the Dean/Program Director . Equivalency will be determined through a comparison of course syllabi. d. For individuals with experience in the armed forces of the United States, or in the National Guard or in a reserve component, the program faculty will review the individual's official military transcripts and occupational experiences to determine whether any of the military education or occupational experiences are substantially equivalent to the curriculum established in Chapter 4723 -5 of the Ohio Admin istrative Code; and award credit to the individual for any substantially equivalent military education or occupational experiences. The individual must initiate the request for transfer through the Student Records Office for any course (s) not previously reviewed for transfer. e. In order for a student to be considered for Military Experience and Training credits, he/she must order a course description for those courses considered for credit through either the Military Joint Services Transcript at Enrollment Management 47 https://jst.doded.mil/smart/signin.do or Air Force/CCAF transcript at www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/transcripts.asp . In addition, he/she must provide a copy of their DD214 to the Student Records office. 6. Once credit is granted, the Student Records Office enters the data into the student information management system. 7. A Degree audit is generated and mailed to the student for review prior to meeting with an academi c advisor. 8. Mercy College does not accept transfer credit for coursework that has been evaluated and deemed developmental. 9. Transfer courses must match or exceed the semester credit -hour requirement for Mercy College courses (quarter hour credits are 2/3 o f a semester hour credit). 10. Evaluation of courses will be completed by the Dean/Program Director responsible for determining course content. For evaluation purposes, courses must have the equivalent content (75% or more) based on the catalog, course descri ption, and/or syllabi for the specific term during which the student completed the course. 11. Transfer credit may be granted for coursework completed at other institutions, advanced placement (AP) coursework, CLEP, or DSST (DANTES) (evaluated on an individual basis). Please refer to the Mercy College Credit by Examination (located on the website http://www.mercycollege.edu/my -mercy/student -records/credit -by- examination/ ) for specific details. Awarded transfer credit grades are reflected on the student's Mer cy College transcript; however, they are not reflected in the student's grade -point average (GPA). Waiver 12. If the decision to waive credit hours is determined, a Waiver/Substitution form must be completed for any course/requirement over 1 credit hour. a. For any course/requirement less than 1 credit hour, a waiver is not required if the total credit hours equals the degree requirements (60 Associate; 120 Bachelor). Appeal 13. If the student disagrees with the awarding of transfer credit, he/she must appeal in writing to the Student Records Office within two weeks (calendar days) of receipt of the degree audit within the acceptance packet. The appeal will then be forwarded to the appropriate Division Dean. 14. Upon receipt of the appeal of a transfer credit evaluation , research will be conducted by the appropriate Division Dean. This Division Dean will notify the student in writing of the decision within ten business days of receipt of the appeal. Please note that while the College will make every reasonable effort t o adhere to the timelines listed in the appeals policy, however, the timeline may extend beyond ten business days.

FINANCIAL AID - TRANSFER STUDENTS If the student has financial aid at another institution for the current academic year, the aid may transfer to Mercy College. Please contact the Financial Aid Office at financialaid@mercyc ollege.edu for assistance. RETURN OF TITLE IV A ID (R2T4) POLICY How a withdrawal affects financial aid. Federal regulations require Title IV financial aid funds to be awarded under the assumption that a student will attend the institution for the entire period in which federal assistance was awarded. When a student withdraws from all courses for any reason, including medical withdrawals, he/she may no longer be eligible for the Enrollment Management 54 full amount of Title IV funds that he/she was originally scheduled to receive. The return of funds is based upon the premise that students earn their financial aid in proportion to t he amount of time in which they are enrolled. A pro -rated schedule is used to determine the amount of federal student aid funds he/she will have earned at the time of the withdrawal. Once 60% of the semester is completed, a student is considered to have earned all of his/her financial aid and will not be required to return any funds. Federal law requires schools to calculate how much federal financial aid a student has earned if that student: Completely withdraws, or Stops attending before completing the semester, or Does not complete all modules (courses which are not scheduled for the entire semester or payment period for which he/she has registered at the time those modules began). Based on this calculation, Mercy College of Ohio students who receive federal financial aid and do not complete their classes during a semester or term could be responsible for repaying a portion of the aid they received. Students who enroll in courses and do not attend must repay all financial aid disbursed for the term. How a withdrawal affects academics. The following policies will help students understand that a withdrawal potentially affects them academically as well as financially. The financial aid staff members encourage students to read all the information below prior to making a final decision. Mercy College of Ohio tuition refund policy is separate from the federal regulations to repay unearned aid. Whether or not a student receives a tuition refund has no bearing on the amount he/she must repay to the federal aid programs. The tuition refund policy is stated in an earlier section. Contact the Business Office for further inquiries. How the earned financial aid is calculated. Students who receive federal financial aid must \"earn\" the aid they receive by remai ning enrolled in classes. The amount of federal financial aid assistance students earn is on a pro -rated basis. Students who withdraw or do not complete all classes for which they are enrolled during a semester may be required to return some of the finan cial aid awarded. Institutions are required to determine the percentage of Title IV aid \"earned\" by the student and to return the unearned portion to the appropriate aid programs. Regulations require schools to perform calculations within 30 days from t he date the school determines a student's complete withdrawal. The school must return the funds within 45 days of the calculation. For example, if a student completes 30% of the payment period, they earn 30% of the aid they were originally scheduled to r eceive. This means 70% of the scheduled awards remain \"unearned\" and must be returned to the federal government. Once 60% of the semester is completed, a student is considered to have earned all of his/her financial aid and will not be required to return any federal funds. Enrollment Management 55 The following formula is used to determine the percentage of unearned aid that has to be returned to the federal government: The percent earned is equal to the number of calendar days completed up to the withdrawal date, divided by the total number of calendar days in the payment period (less any scheduled breaks that are at least 5 days long). The payment period is the entire semester. However, for students enrolled in modules (courses which are not scheduled for the entire semeste r or term), the payment period only includes those days for the module(s) in which the student is registered. The percent unearned is equal to 100% minus the percent earned. For students enrolled in modules . A student is considered withdrawn if the stude nt does not fulfill all of the days in the payment period that the student was scheduled to complet e. Mercy College of Ohio will track enrollment in each module to determine if a student began enrollment in all scheduled courses. If a student officially drops courses in a later module while still attending a current module, the student is not considered as withdrawn based on not attending the later module. However, a recalculation of aid based on a change in enrollment status may still be required. Step s in the Return of Title IV funds policy . Mercy College of Ohio will determine: 1. The total amount of Title IV aid disbursed for the semester in which the student withdrew. A student's Title IV aid is counted as aid disbursed in the calculation if it has been applied to the student's account on or before the date the student withdrew. 2. The total amount of Title IV aid disbursed plus the Title IV aid that could have been disbursed for the semester in which the student withdrew. 3. If the calculated percentage o f Title IV aid was earned as follows: the number of calendar days completed divided by the total number of calendar days in the semester in which the student withdrew. The total number of calendar days in a semester shall exclude any scheduled breaks of more than 5 days. Days Attended \u00f7 Days in Enrollment Period = Percentage Completed 4. If the calculated percentage completed exceeds 60%, then the student has \"earned\" all the Title IV aid for the enrollment period. 5. The calculated amount of Title IV aid is earned as follows: The percentage of Title IV aid earned (Step 2) multiplied by the total amount of Title IV aid disbursed or that could have been disbursed for the term in which the student withdrew . Total Aid Disbursed \u00d7 Percentage Completed = Earned Aid Enrollment Management 56 6. The Amount of Title IV aid to be disbursed or returned a. If the aid already disbursed equals the earned aid, no further action is required. b. If the aid already disbursed is greater that the earned aid, the difference must be returned to the appropri ate Title IV aid program. c. Total Disbursed Aid - Earned Aid = Unearned Aid to be Returned d. If the aid already disbursed is less than the earned aid, then Mercy College of Ohio will calculate a post -withdrawal disbursement. Types of Withdrawals For financial aid purposes there are two types of withdrawals: Official and Unofficial. Official - An official withdrawal from Mercy College of Ohio by the student. For the policy and procedure of Official Withdrawals review the Mercy College of Ohio College Catalog , or contact the Student Records office for more information. Unofficial - Federal financial aid regulations consider a student to be an unofficial withdrawal if the student receives all \"F\" (failure) grades or a combination of \"F\" and \"W\" (withdraw) grades for the term. Determination of the Withdrawal Date . The withdrawal date used in the return calculation of a student's federal financial aid is the actual date indicated on the official drop/ withdrawal form. If a student stops attend ing classes without notifying Mercy College of Ohio, the withdrawal date will be the midpoint of the semester or the last date of academic activity determined by Mercy College of Ohio. Additional documentation supporting the last date of academic activity may be provided by the student if he/she verifies a later date of attendance than determined by Mercy College of Ohio. Withdrawing prior to completing 60% of a term. Unless a student completes 60% of the term in which federal aid was disbursed, the student will be required to return all or part of the financial aid disbursed in the term. This applies to students who have officially or unofficially withdrawn. When a student fails to begin attendance. If a student receives financial aid, but never attends classes, Mercy College of Ohio will return all disbursed funds to the respective federal aid programs. If the student owes money to Mercy College of Ohio resulting from the return of federal funds, the student will be billed by the Business Office. If the student does not pay the funds due to Mercy College of Ohio, a business hold will be placed on the student's account. This means he/she will not be permitted to register for classes or receive transcripts until the balance is paid. Enrollment Management 57 Students who do not receive an earned grade in a term. Financial aid is awarded under the assumption that the student will attend Mercy College of Ohio for the entire term for which federal assistance was disbursed. Mercy College of Ohio is required to have a procedure for determining whether a Title IV recip ient who began attendance during a period completed the period or should be treated as a withdrawal. Students who attended class but failed to meet the academic requirements of the course are awarded a grade of \"F\", this is an earned grade. Students who started a course but stopped attending class at some point and were given a grade of an \"F\"(failure), \"W\"(withdrawal), \"IW\"(instructor withdrawal), \"WP\"(withdraw al passing), or \"WF\" (withdraw al failing) are considered an \"unofficial\" withdrawal, and will b e reviewed to determine the last date of an academically -related activity or the midpoint of the semester. Repayment calculation process. Once grades are posted for the student who receives either all F's, or \"F\" and \"W\" grades, Mercy College of Ohio wil l return all unearned aid to the federal aid programs and the student's billing account will be charged. The Billing Office will mail a bill to the student's permanent address. The student is responsible for any balance due. Definition of an academic -related activity. Examples of Mercy College of Ohio academic - related activities include , but are not limited to , physically attending a class where there is an opportunity for direct interaction between the instructor and students. Proof of participation: Exams or quizzes Tutorials Computer -assisted instruction Completion of an academic assignment, paper or project Participating in online discussion about academic matters Initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a question about the academic subject in the course Documentation not acceptable as proof of participation: Student's self -certification of attendance that is not supported by school documentation Living in Hillcrest Apartments as a Mercy College of Ohio student Participating in academic coun seling or advising Repayment of Federal Aid Programs. Federal regulations require that the following aid programs be subject to the repayment calculation if the student did not attend 60% of the term in the following order: 1. Unsubsidized Direct Stafford Loan 2. Subsidized Direct Stafford Loan 3. Direct PLUS (Parent) Loan 4. Federal Pell Grant 5. Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG) Enrollment Management 58 Overpayment of Federal Grant Funds. Federal regulations provide that 50% of the unearned amount of all federal grants is protected by the federal calculation. Any federal grant money subject to repayment is returned by Mercy College of Ohio and that amount will be billed to the student's billing account as a debt to Mercy College of Ohio. Additional loan information to consider when withdrawing. When a student is enrolled less than part -time, the grace period begins. The student's grace period for loan repayments for Federal Direct Unsubsidized and Subsidized Loans will begin on the day of the withdrawal from the scho ol. If the student is not enrolled part -time for more than 6 months, the loans will go into repayment. The student must contact the U.S. Department of Education or his/her lender(s) to make payment arrangements. Loans must be repaid by the loan borrower (student/parent) as outlined in the terms of the borrower's promissory note. The student should contact the lender if he/she has questions regarding the grace period or repayment status. Repayment of unearned funds and consequences. Unearned funds are paid to the U.S. Department of Education by Mercy College of Ohio on the student's behalf. The school will return the funds within 45 days of the calculation. If the student owes any money to Mercy College of Ohio resulting from the return of unearned fe deral financial aid, the student will be billed by Mercy College of Ohio.

SATISFACTORY ACADEMI C PROGRESS (SAP) POL ICY To provide a process for determining continued eligibility for student financial a id which is in accordance with federal regulations. Whether or not a student has or will receive financial aid , Federal regulations require Mercy College of Ohio to establish and implement a policy to measure if a student is making satisfactory academic p rogress toward a degree or certificate. Mercy College must evaluate students' Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Mercy evaluates progress at the end of each semester and measures student progress as follows: Qualitative Progress (GPA requirement) Qua ntitative Progress (Time -based) These criteria evaluate: the quality and quantity of the academic work a student completes and progress toward completion of his/her academic program. The satisfactory academic progress requirements listed below are minim um standards. Students are encouraged to exceed all of the requirements whenever possible. This policy indicates the standards used to measure Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) at Mercy College of Ohio for purposes of financial aid eligibility. Funds affected by this policy include all applicable federal, state, and college funds including but not limited to Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Federal Direct Stafford Loans, Federal Direct PLUS (Parent) Loans, F ederal Work Study, State Scholarship and Grant programs, all scholarships administered and/or provided by Mercy College of Ohio. The criteria contained in the policy are applied to all eligible degree and certificate seeking students. Students not meet ing the requirements of the policy are notified. Students who fail to make Satisfactory Academic Progress are initially given a Warning period during which time they may continue being awarded aid (if otherwise eligible). Students who do not meet the req uirements by the end of the Warning period are denied future financial aid. A student may appeal the termination of financial aid due to exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances may include but are not limited to illness, death of an immediat e family member, or traumatic events in the student's life. Enrollment Management 60 Requirements for Satisfactory Academic Progress Qualitative Progress Requirement Students' cumulative Mercy College of Ohio grade point average (GPA) will be evaluated each semester. In order to meet graduation requirements for all students and programs, a cumulative 2.0 GPA is considered making SAP. Students enrolled in a program of more than two academic years must have a minimum GPA of 2.0 by the end of the equivalent of the second academic year of coursework. Quantitative Progress Requirement Students must progress through their program to ensure graduation will occur within th e specified maximum timeframe. Mercy College of Ohio calculates the rate at which a student is progressing by dividing the total number of hours the student has successfully completed (including transfer credits) by the total number of hours he/she has at tempted. A student is ineligible for financial aid when it becomes mathematically impossible to complete the program of study within 150% of its published length. The maximum timeframe for which an undergraduate student may receive financial assistance may not exceed 150% of the published length of the student's academic program measured in credit hours, whether or not federal aid was received by the student during this time. For example, if the published length of an academic program is 120 credit ho urs, the maximum timeframe during which the student will be eligible to receive financial aid must not exceed 180* credit hours. Note: this will include any accepted transfer credit hours and prior learning credits that apply toward the degree. *120 cre dit hours X 150% = 180 credit hours. Incomplete (I) Grade If a student is unable to complete all course requirements due to extenuating circumstances, and approved by the instructor, an incomplete grade may be issued. The incomplete grade will not be cal culated into the grade point average. Incomplete coursework must be completed by the tenth class day of the next semester or the grade will be changed to an \"F\". The student will receive a grade for the course when all work has been successfully completed and graded by the instructor. The instructor will change the Incomplete (I) grade to the letter grade earned in the course. The assigned letter grade will be reflected in the next semester which the student i s enrolled. Incomplete grades will be monitored by the Financial Aid Office, as the final assigned grade can affect GPA and SAP requirements. Repeated Courses Students may receive financial aid for repeating courses. Any courses that are repeated will be used in the calculation of a student' s Satisfactory Academic Progress. Each repetition will count toward the attempted hours; however, only the course(s) being counted in the GPA calculation will be counted in completed hours for SAP. See the College catalog for limits on repeated courses. Enrollment Management 61 Progression/Repeating a Course To progress successfully through Mercy College of Ohio, a student must obtain at least a \"C\" grade in all courses taken. A grade of \"D\" is considered unsatisfactory for progression in the College but is recorded on the trans cript and calculated as 1.0 for GPA purposes. A student may retake for credit any course in which a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" has been earned. Only the second grade will be computed in the cumulative GPA; however, both grades will appear on the transcript. Although a student may be permitted to repeat a course more than one time, this forgiveness policy does not apply beyond the first repeat attempt for any one course. Unsatisfactory grades will be used in the calculation of a student's Satisfactory Academic Progress. Withdrawal from a Course Courses that a student withdraws from are considered in \"hours attempted\" toward the maximum timeframe, including \"WP\" (withdraw passing) and \"WF\" (withdraw failing) grades. Transfer Credits Transfer credit hours that h ave been accepted by Mercy College of Ohio toward a current degree are subject to the Satisfactory Academic Progress calculations. Mercy College of Ohio calculates the rate at which a student is progressing by dividing the total number of hours the studen t has successfully completed (including transfer credits) by the total number attempted. Changes in Major or Degree Students who change their major or degree must submit a plan of study completed by their academic advisor to the financial aid office. T he student is eligible to receive aid for no more than 150% of the credit hours required to complete the new program of study. The 150% limit is applied to all credit hours earned by the student while enrolled at Mercy College of Ohio, and includes transf er credits accepted from previously attended institutions. Pursuit of a Second Degree Students who pursue a second degree from Mercy College of Ohio must submit a plan of study completed by their academic advisor to the financial aid office. The student is eligible to receive aid for no more than 150% of the credit hours required to complete the second program of study. The 150% limit is applied to all credit hours earned by the student while enrolled at Mercy College of Ohio, and includes transfer credi ts accepted from previously attended institutions. Credits earned for a degree already awarded by Mercy College of Ohio are not included in the 150% rule. Enrollment Management 62 Academic Dismissal Students may be dismissed from Mercy College of Ohio if they fail to maintain the required cumulative grade point average for the coursework in which they are enrolled. Academic dismissal will occur when a student's cumulative grade point average on attem pted coursework falls below the following: Less than 1.0 after attempting 10 -19 semester credit hours Less than 1.5 after attempting 20 -29 semester credit hours Less than 1.7 after attempting 30 -39 semester credit hours Less than 1.8 after attempting 40 -49 semester credit hours Less than 1.9 after attempting 50 -59 semester credit hours Less than 2.0 after attempting 60 semester credit hours. A student who is academically dismissed will be terminated from aid eligibility and must appeal for re -admission to Mercy College of Ohio. (See College catalog for re -admission guidelines) Consequences of Failure to Meet the Requirements of Satisfactory Academic Progress Warning The first time a degree seeking student fails to maintain satisfactory academic progress by the end of the financial aid payment period/semester, a warning period is automatically generated by the Financial Aid Office. Certificate students are monitored at the end of each semester as well. The student will receive a letter of warning from t he Director of Financial Aid and the student does not need to appeal. The student is provided a warning period to improve his/her standing in order to meet the requirements of SAP.

STUDENT AFFAIRS POLICIES ACCESSIBILITY To provide for equal access, Mercy College of Ohio is committed to making individuals with disabilities full participants in its programs, services , and activities through compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. Responsibility for Equal Access It is the policy of Mercy College of Ohio (the \"College\") that no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall be denied access to the benefits of, or participation in, any program, service , or activity offered by the College. As such, individuals with disabilities have a right to request reasonable accommodations. Specifically, the College does not discriminate on the basis of disability in its admission, recruitment, academics, research, financial aid, counselin g, Student Affairs 74 employment assistance, and/or any other service, facility, or privilege available to students or potential students. Further, the College does not screen out, exclude, expel, limit, or otherwise discriminate against an individual seeking admission as a student, or an individual enrolled as a student, based on disability. All College representatives, including faculty, staff, and students are responsible for the implementation of this policy and adherence to the principles of equal access. Initiating C onsideration for Accommodation Students who are seeking assistance from the Office of Academic Accessibility (OAA), on the basis of a specific disability are responsible for: a) Contacting the Office of Academic Accessibility. Students bear the responsibilit y for disclosure of a disability and the request of services (see attached OAA disclosure form). Official notification usually must be done by the person requesting services, depending on the nature of the disability. b) Providing complete, adequate, and cur rent documentation from an appropriately qualified professional regarding the disability and the need for accommodations (see OAA Documentation Guidelines below.) Students are responsible for costs associated with obtaining the appropriate documentation. c) Notifying the College of accommodation requests prior to the beginning of a semester in order to provide the granted accommodation. However, accommodation requests can be made and will be considered at any time. Please note that granted accommodations are not effective retroactively so that a student will not be able to retake exams or redo assignments that were originally completed before he or she asked for and received an accommodation. In order for Mercy College to fully determine eligibility for ser vices and evaluate requests for accommodations or auxiliary aids, the Office of Academic Accessibility (OAA) needs documentation of the disability. Reasonable Accommodations Reasonable accommodations include modifications to policy, procedure, or practice and the provision of auxiliary aids and services that are designed to provide equal access to programs and services for qualified individuals with disabilities. Accommodations are reasonable when they do not pose a direct threat to health, safety, or qua lity of care; when they do not fundamentally alter the nature of a program or service; and when they do not represent an undue financial or administrative burden. Definition of Disability The United States' Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines \"d isability\" as \"having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities.\" In addition, the ADA protects individuals from discrimination if they have a record of such impairments or if they are regarded as h aving such impairments. Additional protections are provided through Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Student Affairs 75 Essential Elements of Disability Documentation 1. The credentials of the evaluator(s). Documentation should be provided by a licensed or other wise properly credentialed professional who has undergone appropriate and comprehensive training, has relevant experience, and has no personal relationship with the individual being evaluated. A good match between the credentials of the individual making the diagnosis and the condition being reported is expected (e.g., an orthopedic limitation might be documented by a physician, but not a licensed psychologist). 2. A diagnostic statement identifying the disability. Documentation should include a clear diagno stic statement that describes how the condition was diagnosed, provide information on the functional impact, and detail the typical progression or prognosis of the condition. When appropriate, include diagnostic codes from the Diagnostic Statistical Manua l of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). 3. A description of the diagnostic methodology used. As appropriate, documentation should include a description of the diagnostic criteria, evaluation methods, procedures, tests and dates of administration, as well as a clinical narrative, observation, and specific results. Where appropriate to the nature of the disability, having both summary data and specific test scores (with the norming population identified) within the report is recommended. Diagnostic methods that are congruent with the particular disability and current professional practices in the field are recommended. 4. A description of the current functional limitations. Information on how the disabling condition(s) currently impacts the individual provides useful information for both establishing a disability and identifying possible accommodati ons. Documentation should be thorough enough to demonstrate whether and how a major life activity is substantially limited by providing a clear sense of the severity, frequency, and pervasiveness of the condition(s). A combination of the results of forma l evaluation procedures, clinical narrative, and the individual's self -report will be reviewed. While recent documentation is recommended in most circumstances, discretion will be used in accepting older documentation of conditions that are permanent or n on-varying. Likewise, changing conditions and/or changes in how the condition impacts the individual may warrant more frequent updates in order to provide an accurate picture. The need for recent documentation depends on the facts and circumstances of th e individual's condition. 5. A description of the expected progression of stability of the disability. Information on the cyclical or episodic nature of the disability and known or suspected environmental triggers to episodes provides opportunities to antici pate and plan for varying functional impacts. If the condition is not stable, information on interventions for exacerbations and recommended timelines for re-evaluation are most helpful. 6. A description of current and past accommodations, services and/or medications. Documentation should include a description of both current and past medications, auxiliary aids, assistive devices, support services, and accommodations, including their effectiveness (and side -effects) in ameliorating functional impacts of t he disability. Student Affairs 76 7. Recommendations for accommodations, adaptive devices, assistive services, compensatory strategies, and/or collateral support services. Recommended accommodations and strategies should be logically related to functional limitations; if conne ctions are not obvious, a clear explanation of their relationship can be useful in decision -making. Mercy College has no obligation to provide or adopt recommendations made by outside entities. High school special education evaluations, Summary of Perfor mance (SOP) or Individual Educational Program (IEP) documentation, while helpful, may not provide adequate information to document a disability. In addition, references to academic weaknesses/learning differences/test anxiety alone may not substantiate a learning disability diagnosis. Specific Disability Documentation Learning Disabilities: Psycho -educational assessment conducted by the diagnosing licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or other appropriately credentialed professional specializing in learni ng disabilities. Psycho -educational comprehensive battery should include intelligence/ability testing and educational/achievement testing. A full diagnostic report, including all standard test scores as well as subtes t scores and the evaluator's narrative is recommended. Assessments should be normed for adults, i.e. WAIS -III rather than WISC -III. Attention Deficit Disorder: Psychological/Psycho -educational assessment conducted by the diagnosing licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or other appropriately credentialed professional. Psychological Disabilities: Psychological assessment conducted by the diagnosing licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or other appropriately credentialed professional. Speech and Hearing: Full report of assessments conducted by the diagnosing licensed speech/hearing specialist, audiologist, or other appropriately credentialed professional. Visual: Full report of assessments conducted by the diagnosing licensed ophthalmologist, optometrist, or other appropriately credentialed professional. Mobility: Evidence of substantial limitation in upper and/or lower extremity mobility. As appropriate, this may or may not include full report of assessments conducted by the diagnosing licensed medical doctor/physician or other appropriately credentialed professional. Student Affairs 77 Review of Documentation and the Determination of Accommodation All documentation will be reviewed on an individual, case -by-case basis. This calls for an individualized inquiry, examin ing the impact of a disability on the individual and within the specific context of the request for accommodations. There is no list of covered disabilities or accepted diagnostic criteria. 1. Determination of accommodations is an interactive process. The Accessibility Coordinator may contact the evaluator, as necessary and with the student's permission, for clarification of any information (tests results, conclusions, recommendations, etc.) contained in the documentation. An interview with the student wil l be conducted in order to inquire about the disability, understand its impacts and identify appropriate accommodations. The institution and the individual with a disability will determine appropriate accommodations. 2. Documentation of a specific disability does not t ranslate directly into specific accommodations. Reasonable accommodations are individually determined and based on the functional impact of the condition and its likely interaction with the environment. As such, accommodations may var y from in dividual to individual with the \"same\" disability diagnosis and from env ironment to environment for the same individual. Accommodations granted at Mercy College of Ohio in no way guarantee that the same accommodations will be granted at other institutions , testing centers, or licensing agencies. Students are solely responsible for pursuing accommodations at other institutions, testing centers, or licensing agencies. OAA may assist in the process at the student's request. Process of Approved Accommodatio ns Once an accommodation has been granted, the student's instructors will receive, by the student's request, email notification from the Office of Academic Accessibility to verify the accommodations each semester. Students with accommodations are also re sponsible to speak with each of their instructors about their needs and work with them to enhance their learning. Students with accommodations are to submit their testing schedule to the Student Affairs Coordinator at the beginning of each semester if th eir tests will be proctored in the Testing Center. Students who have received accommodations may request modifications to those accommodations at any time. Academic Honesty & Integrity An accommodation based on a student's disability may relate to the administration of testing, examinations, or other coursework. Students provided with such accommodations must continue to adhere to the College's Academic Honesty & Integrity Policy and to the Student Code of Conduct/Discipline Protocol. Failure to adhere to either of these policies may result in disciplinary action. Student Affairs 78 RECORDING OF CLASSROOM PRESENTATIONS The purpose of the Recording of Classroo m Presentations is to provide an appropriate approval and use of such activity as it takes place in the classroom. Mercy College of Ohio prohibits students from the recording and transmission of classroom presentations with any faculty member unless that student has obtained the expressed written consent of the faculty member. For purposes of this policy, a \"recording\" is a video or audio replication or photographic image recorded on devices including, but not limited to, audio recorders, video recorders, cellular/smart phones, digital cameras, media players, computers and other devices that record images or sound. Obtaining Permission Before any lecture or at the beginning of the course, students who wish to record the proceedings must sign the Mercy College of Ohio Electronic Recording Release Form and submit a signed copy to the faculty member prior to activating any recording device. The faculty member has the option to approve or disapprove the request on the form. If the faculty member a pproves of the recording request, he/she will copy the signed agreement and return one copy to the student, retain a copy for his/her files and provide one copy to his/her Program Director and/or Dean. The student must obtain signed permission from each i nstructor whose class he/she wishes to record. This includes when two or more faculty members are teaching the same class. A new Electronic Recording Release Form must be signed each semester for each class where permission to record is being requested. Revoking Permission Faculty member(s) may rescind permission to record at any time and will do so by notifying the student in writing. Further, a faculty member may require that all recording devices be turned off at any point during the class period. T he faculty member does not have to give an explanation in either of these situations. Proper Use of a Recording The following concepts apply to students' use of recordings: Recording of lectures or classroom presentations is solely for the purpose of individual or group study with other students enrolled in the same class. The recorded materials and all information contained within, are protected under federal copyright laws and may not be published or quoted without written permission of the presenter(s) and Mercy College of Ohio.

Student Affairs 86 Reporting Procedures and Protocol The College's primary concern is the safety of its campus community and members. The use of alcohol or drugs never makes the victim at fault for sexual violence or assault. Moreover, victims should not be deterred from reporting incidents of sexual violence or assault. Criminal Reporting Procedures Reporting to Public Safety and/or the local police is an option at any time following a sexual violence or assault incident. If the victim chooses not to report to the police immediately, he/she can still make th e report at a later time. However, with the passage of time, the ability to gather evidence to assist with criminal prosecution may be limited. Depending on the circumstances, the police may be able to obtain a criminal restraining order on the victim's behalf. Administrative A student, faculty member , or staff member who has a complaint against a student, faculty, staff member , or other individual involving a suspected violation of this policy or of retaliation should contact the Title IX Coordinator an d/or Deputy Title IX Coordinator. Faculty and staff, except those statutorily barred from doing so, are required to report any suspected violations of this policy. This should occur within 24 hours. Ohio law requires all employees with knowledge of a fe lony to report it to law enforcement. All college personnel shall report conduct prohibited by the College's Anti -Discrimination and Harassment Policy and this Title IX/Sexual Misconduct procedure to the Title IX Coordinator or other responsible employee. To encourage reporting on the part of students, victims of misconduct will not be charged with alcohol, drug and most other policy violations related to their efforts to seek assistance. Contact information for the Title IX and Deputy Title IX Coordinato rs is listed later in this department. The Title IX Coordinator and/or Deputy Title IX Coordinator will provide the victim with written and verbal information regarding the procedures for investigating and addressing the incident. The Title IX Coordinat or and/or Deputy Title IX Coordinator will also discuss with the victim any reasonable interim remedies the College may offer prior to the conclusion of an investigation or potential disciplinary action to reduce or eliminate the negative impact and provid e available assistance. Interim protective measures and actions were discussed earlier in this policy. These interim protective measures and actions may be available whether the individual chooses to report the sexual violence or assault to Public Safety/Police Department or local law enforcement. The Title IX Coordinator and/or Deputy Title IX Coordinator remain available to assist the individual and provide reasonable remedies requested by the individual throughout the reporting, investigative an d disciplinary processes, and thereafter. Student Affairs 87 If it is determined that the College's Title IX Policy was violated, the perpetrator will be subject to discipline, up to and including dismissal from College employment or dismissal from the College (student). T he individual is entitled to be accompanied to any related meeting or proceeding by an advisor selected by the individual. However, if the victim does not wish to participate in an investigation or hearing process, the individual has the right to decline. Although there is no specific time limit for reporting a suspected violation of this policy, a student or employee who believes that he or she has been subjected to conduct that violates this policy is encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator and/or Deputy Title IX Coordinator. Health/Counseling/Clergy The individual may choose to seek advice and assistance from physicians, psychotherapists, professional counselors, clergy, sexual assault and domestic violence counselors and advocates, includi ng individuals who work or volunteer for them. Civil Lawsuit The individual may choose to file a civil lawsuit against the perpetrator, whether or not criminal charges have been filed. A civil lawsuit provides the victim the opportunity to recover actual damages, which may include compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, pain, suffering, and emotional distress. The victim may also choose to obtain a protective or restraining order. Restraining orders must be obtained from a court in the jurisdicti on where the incident occurred. Restraining orders can protect victims who have experienced or are reasonably in fear of sexual violence or assault, including domestic violence, dating violence or stalking. The Title IX Coordinator/ Deputy Title IX Coord inator can offer assistance with obtaining a protective or restraining order. Non -Reporting The individual is strongly encouraged to report any incident of sexual violence or assault to the police and/or the College's Title IX Coordinator/Deputy Title IX Coordinator so that steps may be taken to protect the College community.

Prohibition against Retaliation Retaliation exists when action is taken against a participant in the complaint process that adversely affects the individual's employment or academic status, and is motivated in whole or in part by t he individual's participation, or lack thereof, in the complaint process. No individual involved in a complaint alleging a violation of this policy or participating in the investigation or resolution of such a complaint shall be subject to retaliation as a result of such activity or participation. Any acts of retaliation, as defined in this policy, shall be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal for students and termination for faculty and staff. Investigation Procedures and Proto col An investigation into the report of a violation of the Title IX Policy will be conducted by either the Title IX Coordinator, Deputy Title IX Coordinator, or another faculty/staff member trained in conducting Title IX investigations to determine if a vi olation of policy has occurred. The investigating officer will commence an investigation no later than seven (7) days after the complaint was made. The purpose of the investigation is to gather all relevant facts from involved parties and provide this in formation to the hearing officer. During the course of an investigation, the investigating officer may receive counsel from College administrators or other parties as needed. A prompt, fair, and thorough investigation of the complaint will occur. The investigation will be concluded as quickly as possible typically no later than sixty (60) days after the start of the investigation. Pending Criminal Investigation Mercy College of Ohio will comply with law enforcement request s for cooperation when appropriate. Such cooperation may require the College to temporarily suspend the fact -finding aspect of the Title IX investigation while the law enforcement agency is in the process of gathering evidence. The criminal investigation, however, does not relieve the College of its responsibilities under Title IX. The College will promptly resume its investigation as soon as notified by the law enforcement agency that it has completed the evidence gathering process of its investigation. The parameters of what information may or may not be shared with law enforcement are outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding with Public Safety and local law enforcement. Student Affairs 89 Content of the Investigation During the course of the investigation, the inv estigating officer will conduct interviews with the complainant, respondent, and witnesses. The investigating officer will also collect any non - testimonial evidence including physical and electronic , and will preserve evidence in a manner that protects th e quality of the evidence. Rights of the Parties During the course of the investigation and resolution of a complaint, the complainant and respondent shall have equal rights, including: Equal opportunity to identify and have considered witnesses and othe r relevant evidence. Similar and timely access to all information considered by the investigating officer. Equal opportunity to review any statements or evidence provided by the other party. Equal access to review and comment upon any other information ind ependently developed by the investigating officer. The respondent will be prohibited from questioning or seeking evidence about the complainant's prior sexual conduct with anyone other than the alleged perpetrator. (This includes clarifying the evidence o f a prior consensual dating or sexual relationship between the parties by itself does not imply consent or preclude a finding of sexual misconduct). Both a complainant and a respondent may ask a support person/advisor to accompany him or her at all stages of the process. The support person/advisor does not serve as an advocate on behalf of the complainant or respondent and may not be actively involved in any proceedings, and he or she must agree to maintain the confidentiality of the process. Mercy Colle ge reserves the right to dismiss a support person/advisor who is disruptive or who does not abide by the limitations in the previous sentence. All victims of sexual violence or assault are provided with information and options regarding: Hospital, medical, nurse forensic examiner availability. Seeking personal counseling and advocacy. Preserving evidence. Making a complaint to local law enforcement and/or Public Safety/Police Department. Calling 911 as needed. Victim's rights and College responsibil ities regarding judicial non -contact, restraining, protective orders, changing living arrangements, and federal student aid options. Filing a complaint under this policy. Student Affairs 90 Interim Remedial Measures Pending the outcome of the investigation, Mercy College o f Ohio will take steps necessary to protect the parties and the College community. At any time during the investigation, the investigating officer, the Title IX/Deputy Title IX Coordinator may determine interim remedies or protections for the parties invo lved or witnesses as appropriate. Possible interim measures were identified earlier in this policy. Failure to comply with the terms of any interim remedial measures or protections may constitute a separate violation of College policy. Confidentiality R equests A victim of sexual violence or assault may ask that the incident be kept confidential. The College may not be able to grant that request, if in doing so, limits the College's ability to investigate the particular incident or to provide a safe, non discriminatory environment for all students. When appropriate and possible, the College may take steps to limit the effects of the alleged sexual misconduct and prevent its recurrence without initiating formal action against the alleged perpetrator or rev ealing the identity of the student complainant. Examples of steps that may be taken are: providing increased monitoring, supervision, or security at locations or activities where the misconduct occurred, providing training and education materials for stud ents and employees, revising and publicizing College policies on sexual misconduct, and conducting climate surveys regarding sexual misconduct. Even absent of confidentiality requests, information will be shared with a limited number of \"responsible emp loyees\" and kept securely maintained in a secure file in the office of the Title IX Coordinator/Deputy Title IX Coordinator. Responsible employees who are not bound by confidentiality (e.g., licensed counselors, licensed medical professionals, and clergy) should let the student know up front that they must disclose the identity of that student and the incident to the Title IX/Deputy Title IX Coordinator. Grievance/Adjudication Procedures If the investigating officer determines a violation of Title IX policy occurred, the matter will be adjudicated in the following manner. 1. A Hearing Panel will be established. Its members will consist of the Vice President of Student Affairs and two other individuals from a predetermined pool of trained faculty and sta ff. 2. The complainant and the respondent will be requested to be present at the hearing to retell their version of the events in question. The hearing process will not exceed thirty (30) business days. 3. The College will maintain documentation of all hearings or other proceedings, which may include various forms (e.g., notes, written findings of fact, transcripts, audio recordings, etc.). 4. Within three (3) business days of the conclusion of the hearing, both the complainant and respondent will simultaneously be informed in writing by the Vice President of Student Affairs 91 Student Affairs of the outcome of the hearing. The letter will state the ruling of \"violation\" or \"no violation\" of the policy and any corrective actions/remedies that will be put into place. A decision will always be reached. The College may disclose to the complainant information about any corrective actions/remedies taken that relate directly to the complainant (e.g., \"no contact\" order). In no event will the complainant be required to abide by a nondiscl osure agreement that would prevent disclosure of the outcome. 5. If there is a finding of policy violation, appropriate, corrective action/remedies by the College will be taken to: a. Eliminate the policy violation. b. Prevent the recurrence of the violation. c. Address the effects of the violation. 6. Recordings, notes, investigations, findings, and determinations will be kept in a secure file within the office of the Title IX Coordinator/Deputy Title IX Coordinator. Mediation is never appropriate in sexual miscond uct cases. However, in all other alleged Title IX violations informal resolution is appropriate if both parties agree. At any point during an informal resolution process either the complainant or respondent can suspend the proceedings and move to formal resolution. Appeals A complainant or respondent may appeal the determination of a complaint only on the following grounds: 1. There is a substantial likelihood that newly discovered information, not available at the time evidence was presented, would result in a different decision. 2. There was a procedural error significant enough to call the outcome into question. 3. There was a clear error in factual findings. 4. Bias or prejudice was shown on the part of the investigating officer or hearing panel. 5. The disciplinar y sanction imposed is disproportionate to the offense. Appeals must be filed in writing with the President of the College within seven (7) business days of receipt of the written report determining the outcome of the complaint and include: Name of the com plainant.

The decision of the President is final. The President shall issue a short and plain, written statement of the resolution of the appeal, including any changes made to the investigating officer or hearing panel's previous written determination. The written statement shall be provided to the complaina nt, respondent, and the Title IX Coordinator/Deputy Title IX Coordinator within three (3) business days of the resolution.

(Derived from the HIGHER EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH ALLIANCE (HEMHA) -Balancing Safety and Support on Campus; A guide for campus teams - http://www.jedfoundation.org/campus_teams_guide.pdf .) HAZING Hazing is a violation of Mercy College of Ohio's (\"the College\") policy. The College is committed to providing an environment of well -being, learning, and accountability for its members. \"Hazing\" is the act or coercing of another, including the person b eing hazed, to do any act of initiation into any student or other organization that causes or creates a substantial risk of causing mental or physical harm to any person. To this end, College Hazing Policy is grounded in three standards and applies to b oth individuals and groups: (1) Compliance with governing law and College policies; (2) Respect for the College Community, through the prevention/ zero tolerance of hazing; (3) Accountability for reporting hazing. This policy informs students of their ind ividual and community responsibilities regarding hazing, the College's response to Hazing Policy violations, and the resources available for addressing concerns related to hazing or suspected hazing. The policy refers to the College students whether they are on or off campus. The College Vice President of Student Affairs has primary responsibility for enforcement of this policy. The Vice President of Student Affairs and/or his/her designee will impose or modify sanctions for violations of this policy, as they deem appropriate in their sole discretion. Any student who participates in hazing is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, pursuant to the Student Code of Conduct and Disciplin e Protocol . It is also a violation of policy fo r an administrator, staff, or faculty member to permit the hazing of any person. College employees who observe or otherwise become aware of hazing (1) must make a reasonable attempt to prevent it and (2) must immediately report the situation to the Vice P resident of Student Affairs. When determining whether this paragraph has been violated, the College will consider whether the employee knew or reasonably should have known of the hazing and failed to take appropriate action. Student Affairs 109 DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENT ION Mercy College has an ethical and professional duty to students, employees, patients, and to the community to provide an environment that maintains high standards of safety, health, and efficiency. The use, sa le, transfer or possession of controlled substances or alcohol by students creates a potential for harm. This policy provides guidelines to deal with actual or potential situations in a systematic manner. An agreement to abide by this policy is a conditi on of enrollment at Mercy College of Ohio. The Agreement is reviewed and signed at College orientation or during online orientation. General Statement It is the responsibility of all students to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with College requirements for maintaining an environment free from threat to person, property, efficiency or reputation because of illegal use, sale, transfer, or possess ion of alcohol or dangerous drugs as defined by Section 2925.01 of the Ohio Revised Code and United States Code 21, Section 811 and 844. Policy 1. The use, sale, transfer or possession of controlled substances, alcohol or dangerous drugs, as defined by Section 2925.01 of the Ohio Revised Code during working hours, on clinical assignment or any Mercy organization property is forbidden, and are grounds for disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from the College. The presence of controlled substances and/or alcohol in a student's physical system during working hours or while the student is on clinical assignment is grounds for dismissal from the College. 2. The illegal use, sale, transfer or possession of controlled or illegal substances off -College property or clinical sites constitutes grounds for dismissal from the College. 3. Law enforcement may be notified of illegal sale, use, transfer or po ssession of controlled or illegal substances required by Section 2921.22, Ohio Revised Code, which states in part, \"No person knowing that a felony is being committed shall knowingly fail to report such information t o law enforcement authorities.\" 4. Mercy Co llege may take any disciplinary action deemed appropriate for violation of this policy. Violation of this policy may result in dismissal from Mercy College. 5. Mercy College is under no financial obligation to assist any student who violates this policy. However, efforts would be made to assist and guide the student in initiating appropriate referral and rehabilitation. 6. Mercy College will permit the legal use of medication or drugs prescribed by a licensed practitioner if such usage does not adversely affect the student or others. Mercy College reserves the right to define \"adversely affect,\" and it will do so in consideration of the health and saf ety of the student and others. The College may, at its discretion and upon consideration of the specific circumstances, take all necessary action (which may include disability accommodation or a range of discipline, as appropriate to those Student Affairs 110 circumstances) when a student is deemed to be adversely affected by the use of legally prescribed medications. 7. In cases in which the faculty or staff member reasonably suspect violations of this policy, these individuals may request a drug screen. The same drug screening protocol outlined under \"Reasonable Suspicion\" in the \"Criminal Background Check and Drug Screen Proce dures \" for clinical students\" will be followed.

An email account is assigned to students when admitted, including a user name and password. The email account will be used to send important correspondence from the College. Email accounts should be checked daily. All email is the property of Mercy Coll ege. Email accounts have 500 MB of storage space, so it is important to delete unwanted messages. Remember to check the Sent box and the Deleted box, also. Mercy College email cannot be forwarded to another email address. Passwords expire every 90 days and notification emails are sent when approaching expiration . If a password is forgotten or your password expires , contact the Service -Desk at 1 -800 -498 - 1408 and have them route a ticket to the Mercy College Field Services Group. Misuse of Electronic Ma il Email is covered under the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986. This act provides for prosecution of individuals found surreptitiously capturing, reading, or altering another's email without permission. Mail deemed obscene or otherwise abusiv e by the recipient is considered an abuse of network privileges. Any attempt to forge an email message is considered an abuse of network privileges. If a user receives email that could have been forged, it is in the best interests of all parties involved to confirm the email with the sender via personal contact. Contact the Director of Information Technology at 419 -251-7331 , or forward the email to abuse @mercycollege.edu if it is determined the email is a forgery. Please save a complete copy of the original message for further investigation. An individual's account on the network may be temporarily restricted for many reasons, including: Maintenance or servicing of ne twork resources Dissemination of information before continued use of an account Investigation of policy violations or suspected abuse of an account. Temporary access restrictions are intended to be short lived and usually require the account's owner t o contact the email administrator for reactivation. Investigations of network policy violations may require any number of potentially affected accounts to be temporarily restricted. The owner of the account may not be the object of the investigation if, for example, it is suspected that the user's password has been stolen by a third party. Permanent Restrictions If it is determined that a user's policy violations are so serious that continued use of the Network would infringe upon the rights or security of other users, the user's account will be permanently restricted. The Director of IT Services must approve all permanent access restrictions. All accounts assigned to a user may be restricted and future network privileges denied. Student Affairs 118 Severe Abuse An individual accused of severe abuse, as defined by the College IT department, may be referred to the Vice President of St udent Affairs for further action or to the appropriate law enforcement agency. Mass Email All Mercy College students, faculty, and staff are requested not to create mass email address lists. Sending a message to hundreds of people at once puts serious co nstraints on resources and may crash some systems. Limit messages to the most appropriate recipients. Unauthorized mass emails are prohibited and will result in immediate loss of computing privileges. An example of an unauthorized mass emailing is using an address book or a directory service to send SPAM email to every user listed. In cases where the System Administrator observes a decline in server performance due to excessive incoming email, the email recipient will be requested to reduce the volume b y unsubscribing from lists, etc. SPAM Spam could result in the loss of your computing privileges. Spam is unsolicited bulk email on the Internet. It includes chain letters, items for sale, get rich quick scams, or any other unwanted email that people often receive. Do not send these messages, and if you reply to them do not reply to all recipients. If you receive any suspicious emails, forward them to abuse@mercycollege.edu so they can be evaluated and ad ded if needed to our SPAM filters.

INSTRUCTION GENERAL EDUCATION PHILOSOPHY OF GENERA L EDUCATION The liberal arts provide the foundation for General Education coursework at the College. Based on a Judeo -Christian philosophy, courses are required in the humanities, social sciences, mathematics, physical sciences, religion and ethics. The purpose of general education is to provide students with a broad base of knowledge that is relevant to all educated persons. Further, general education encourages students to develop their intellect, examine their values in ethical decision making, think critically, solve problems, communicate effectively, embrace cultural diversity, pursue lifelong learning, and serve in the global community. The responsibility of general education lies with the entire College community as the liberal arts are integrated throughout the curriculum and in co -curricular activities. The goal is that graduates will be prepared to enter their respective profession with a solid foundation in the liberal arts, and their program of study in order to serve in the global community. Academic Affairs 129 MER CY COLLEGE OF OHIO I NSTITUTIONAL LEARNIN G OUTCOMES Mercy College has five Institutional Learning Outcomes (ILO's) that are linked to the general education requirements and program -specific coursework. Based on these five outcomes the students will: 1. Exhibit proficiency and competency within one's discipl ine in service to others. 2. Integrate critical thinking skills to reason logically using data from appropriate disciplines to solve problems and make decisions. 3. Communicate clearly in both written and oral forms of expression. 4. Demonstrate an understanding of Catholic teachings within one's ethical and professional decision -making. 5. Display an understanding of cultures and experiences that characterize the global community. ASSESSMENT OF STUDEN T LEARNING Mercy College assesses student learning outcomes through a variety of methods that are linked to coursework and aligned with course assignments that include testing, journals, reflections, written work, oral presentations, and participation in co -curricular activities. Rubrics are used as a tool for assessment of the assigned work. The data gained from the assessment rubrics provides information regarding the achievement of the learning outcomes. Assessment of student learning is completed at the following levels: course, pro grammatic, and institutional. Assessment of student learning provides quantitative and qualitative data for measurement of student achievement. The assessment process produces information which supports data -driven decisions for overall curricular improve ment. Assessment activities are conducted from the time a student enters the College until the time they exit, plus post -graduation surveys, etc. Student participation is essential to the process as it completes the cycle of assessment. Learning Outcomes identified - Assessment of Learning Outcomes - Data Collection and Analysis - Curricular Improvement measures recommended and implemented. Overall assessment is part of the institutional effectiveness of the organization. The quality model of Plan, Do, C heck/Study, and Act is used as a method to improve the College curriculum.

CREDIT HOUR DEFI NITION AND LENGTH OF SEMESTER As required in the Higher Education Reauthorization Act of 2011, Mercy College of Ohio has adopted the following federal definitio n of a credit provided in 34 CFR 668.8(k) and (l), a credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than \u2014 (1) One hour of c lassroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or (2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, s tudio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. Academic Affairs 132 In addition, Mercy College of Ohio has adopted the credit hour guidelines, revised March 2010, by the Ohio Department of Higher Education (formerly the Ohio Board of Regents), as specifically defined in the procedures that follow. The policy in its entirety can be found at: https://www.mercycollege.edu/my -mercy/student - records/credit -hour -definition/ CREDIT HOUR DEFINITION AND CALCULATION EXAMPLES I. Assumptions: 1. Mercy College of Ohio operates two 16 -week semesters (15 instructional weeks with one exam week) and one 12 -week semester in the summer. 2. Actual course sections may be shorter than th e sixteen weeks (4, 5, 6, 8 or 12 weeks, or other) as long as the total instructional hours equal the numbers as defined in the sections below. 3. The length of time for course sections longer than two hours may be adjusted to include a class break, as long a s the total instructional time , not including the break , maintains the length of time as set forth in the sections below. 4. Procedures for scheduling courses are available from the Registrar's Office. II. Establishment of course credit hours: 1. The respective ac ademic divisions (Deans in collaboration with faculty) establish credit hours for courses following the policies of the Ohio Department of Higher Education (formerly the Ohio Board of Regents) and the Higher Learning Commission. 2. The respective academic di vision, College Curriculum Committee, and Vice President of Academic Affairs approve the courses. 3. A random sample of existing courses is audited once per year by the Vice President of Academic Affairs to ensure the courses are consistent with policy. Cour ses found to be inconsistent are sent to the College Curriculum Committee for revision. III. Classroom Instruction: 1. Classroom instruction is formalized instruction, conducted on or off campus, in which the instructor presents an educational experience to students, applying any combination of instructional methods. The types of instructional methods used are defined bel ow. a. Land -Based (Face -to-Face): Land -based courses deliver all instruction, communication and assignments through face -to-face class meetings with other support material (syllabus, lecture notes, check -offs, handouts, etc.) available online. All land -based courses are signified with an \"O\" in the course section number and/or have a specified campus location designated in the class schedule. Academic Affairs 133 b. Online ( Distance Education Offering) : An online or distance education course uses primarily the internet to del iver instruction either synchronously or asynchronously. However, the use of other communication such as video or voice conferencing may be used to supplement the internet environment. If the class meets at a specified time online, the instructor must list the day and time of the week in the class schedule. Exclusive online courses have no land -based instruction. However, some courses require a land -based service learning/practicum com ponent with a clinical preceptor in attendance. Assessment (testing) of students may also require attendance at a proctored location. Online courses or distance course are signified with a \"W\" in the course section number and/or have \"online\" as the lo cation in the class schedule. c. Hybrid (Distance Education Offering) : A hybrid course delivers instruction through land -based class meetings and the internet. A typical hybrid course is 50% land -based and 50% online. However, the online component may ran ge from 40 - 99% of total class instruction. Hybrid methodology may include the use of both synchronous and asynchronous scheduled instruction. Scheduled instruction can be offered in a variety of formats, which include, but are not limited , to weekly or e very other week learning modules. All hybrid courses are signified with an \"H\" in the course section number and/or have \"hybrid\" a s the location in the schedule. d. Web -Enhanced/Web -Supported: Web -Enhanced or Web -Supported courses deliver instruction primari ly through land -based class meetings. Supplemental web -based tools are used to enhance a course, which can include online components and activities that consist of viewing syllabi, participating in discussions, viewing presentations, content links, handouts , and testing . All web -enhanced courses are signified with an \"O\" in the course section number and/or have a specified campus location designated in the class schedule. IV. Calculation of Credit Hours Awarded: 1. Classroom Instruction: One credit hour is awarded for each 750 minutes of classroom instruction in a 15 -week semester for all online, hybrid, web -enhanced and land -based courses. (Each credit hour is equivalent to one 50 -minute class hour for every one hour of classroom or dir ect faculty instruction, for approximately 15 weeks. i.e. 3 credit hours equal 45 class hours or 15x3=45 ) a. Each credit hour will require an average two 50 -minute hours of out of class work for each week. This out of class study does not count as part of th e classroom hour for credit. b. Student learning outcomes and assignments are required to be consistent across the same course, despite the instructional method employed. Therefore, a reasonable assertion is made that credit awarded is the same regardless of the instructional delivery method used. Academic Affairs 134 c. Other types of instructional delivery options are assigned credit hours based on a ratio of contact hours to credit hours, per the Ohio Department of Higher Education, formerly the Ohio Board of Regents. (http://reg ents.ohio.gov/actions/ documents/2010/Dir2010 -016.pdf) 2. Laboratory Instruction: Laboratory instruction is defined as educational activity with students conducting experiments, perfecting skills, or practicing procedures under the direction of a faculty member. a. One hour of credit shall be awarded for a total of 2,250 minutes laborato ry instructional time for a semester calendar (three hours for every one hour of credit). b. If laboratory instruction is supplemented by out -of-class assignments, which would normally average one hour of out -of-class study preparing for or following -up the laboratory experience, then one hour of credit shall be awarded for a total of 1,500 minutes laboratory instructional time for a semester (two hours for every hour of credit) . 3. Clinical Laboratory Instruction : Clinical laboratory instruction applies only to health programs during which students are assigned to laboratory sections, which meet at a health -related agency rather than an on -campus laboratory facility. Clinical laboratory sessions provide a realistic environment for student learning. These laborat ory hours should be directly supervised by full -time or part -time faculty members or adjuncts of the College. a. Credit hours for the clinical laboratory experience will be awarded on the same basis as laboratory hours. 4. Directed Practice Instruction : This definition applies primarily to programs in the health areas during which the student is assigned to practice experiences under constant supervision at an external agency. The student should receive individual instruction and critique in the perform ance of a particular function. Adjunct faculty may be used for the direct supervision of students, and for the delivery of part of the didactic phase of the experience. The faculty member coordinating the directed practice conducts at least one lecture session each week for participating students, provides the final grade for each student, and visits students at least once a week. a. One credit (quarter or semester) shall be awarded for a minimum of five clock hours of directed practice in a week. 5. Practic um Instruction : Practicum instruction is an on -or off-campus work experience, integrated with academic instruction. Students concurrently apply theoretical concepts to practical situations within an occupational field. To assure proper coordination of the experience, the practicum is coordinated by a faculty member who visits the student at least once biweekly, provides the final grade, and teaches at least one course on the campus. Academic Affairs 135 Each student who is enrolled in a p racticum shall also be enrolled in an on -campus seminar. a. A maximum of nine semester credit hours may be earned in a practicum, or any combination of practicum cooperative work experience, during the program. b. One hour of credit shall be awarded for 6,300 m inutes of practicum instructional time for a semester. 6. Seminar Instruction: A seminar is a less formal educational experience than a classroom/lecture/discussion class. A relatively small number of students engage in discussions directed by a faculty mem ber. a. Credit is awarded for seminar hours on the same basis as that for the classroom hour discussed above. COURSE REPEAT To progress successfully through Mercy College of Ohio, a student must obtain at least a \"C\" grade in all courses taken. A grade of \"D\" * is considered unsatisfactory for progression in the College but is recorded on the transcript and calculated as 1.0 for GPA purposes. A student may retake for credit any course in which a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" has been earned. Only the second grade will b e computed in the cumulative GPA; however, both grades will appear on the transcript. Although a student may be permitted to repeat a course more than one time, this forgiveness policy does not apply beyond the first repeat attempt for any one course. Unsatisfactory grades will be used in the calculation of a student's Satisfactory Academic Progress . If a student wishes to register a third time for a course he/she did not pass with a \"C\" or higher, he/she must obtain permission from the Dean of the divis ion in which the course is offered. The student must present documented reasons why he/she was unable to pass the course on the first two attempts and what measures the student will take to ensure success in the third attempt. If the request is granted, the student will not be permitted to take any other course(s) while enrolled in the course being repeated. Note: This will impact financial aid. The student will also be required to sign and abide by the stipulations in a Learning Contract. If possible, the student must enroll in a section taught by a different instructor than in either of the previous attempts. *Students who are pursuing an Associate of Science Degree in General Studies may earn a \"D\" in their program of study and remain eligible for gr aduation as long as the cumulative GPA is at least 2.0. If a student changes his/her major and transitions into another program of study, he/she will have to repeat the course(s) with the \"D\" grade(s) to meet program specific graduation requirements (plea se see specific program handbook). Academic Affairs 136 COURSE AUDIT Any student auditing a class must notify the Student Records Office during registration prior to the start of the semester. Furthermore, a student wishing to audit a class must have the permission of the instructor. The student who is auditing a class is not required to take examinations. Students may not audit the clinical component of any nursing or allied health course. An audit designation will appear on the student's transcript; however, no credit is given as it is not included in the student's grade point average or total course load for purposes of enrollment certification. An audit withdrawal designation (WA) will be recorded on the student's transcript if the instructor certifies that the student has not regularly attended classes. A student may not change class registration status either from audit to credit or from credit to audit after the second week of the clas s. Credit by Examination may not be requested on the basis of auditing a class. The fee for audited courses is $100/credit hour. OVERLOAD If a student desires to register for more than 18 credit hours, in one term, he/she must be granted approval by the student's assigned advisor /faculty member and Dean. A Waiver/Substitution Form can be obtained in the Student Records Office and should be completed and signed by the student's advisor and the Division Dean. Students registering for course s in the Summer Semester should not exceed 14 credit hours for the entire summer term and should not exceed seven credit hours in any one Summer Session. In order to register for more hours during the Summer Semester than listed above, a Waiver/Substituti on Form must be completed and signed and approved by the student's advisor /faculty member and the Division Dean. ADD/DROP Schedule changes may be processed during the add/drop period. As a result of schedule changes, a student may be eligible for a refund of a portion of fees (See Refund Policy). A student wishing to add a course within the first week of the course session ( 5-week, 6 -week, 8-week, 10 -week, 12 -week and 16 -week) can do so with instructor and advisor permission only through the Student Records Office. The effective date of the add/drop is the day the student changes his/her schedule online or the request is fil ed in the Student Records Office. A student may add/drop a course(s) during the first week the course is offered. A student may only drop a course(s) during the second week of the course session in the Student Records Office, but not add any courses afte r the first week of the course session (this applies to 12 -week and 16 -week course sessions). Academic Affairs 137 ADD/DROP/WITHDRAW TABLE Course Offering (Week is defined as seven calendar days). 16 weeks 12 weeks 10 weeks 8 weeks 6 weeks 5 weeks Last Day to Add/Drop 1st week 1st week 1st week 1st week 1st week 1st week Last Day to Drop 2nd week 2nd week 1st week 1st week 1st week 1st week Last Day to Withdraw 8th week 6th week 5th week 4th week 3rd week 2nd week *For courses offered outside of the typical weeks, an add/drop/withdraw schedule is determined based on the number of days the course is offered. FINAL EXAMINATIONS Final exams are administered during the 16th week of the semester. Most courses require a final examination and students may only be excused un der extraordinary circumstances. In case of an emergency, the faculty member must be notified prior to the exam. The exam will be rescheduled at the earliest possible time by the faculty member (See syllabus for further explanation). A grade of \"I\" (inc omplete) will be assigned if the exam cannot be completed by the end of exam week. The incomplete policy will be followed at this point. WITHDRAWAL WITHDRAWAL FROM A CO URSE A student who elects to withdraw from a course must meet with the instructor of the course, secure a Registration Form from the Student Records Office , complete the form and obtain a signature from his/her academic advisor and submit the completed form to the Student Records Office . Once a student has been withdrawn from a course, he/she cannot be reinstated into the same course and section that semester. (See Return to Title IV in College Catalog) . WITHDRAWAL FROM THE COLLEGE To officially withdraw from Mercy College of Ohio, a student must notify the Student Records Office either by submitting the Withdrawal/Leave of Absence Request Form or by verbally notifying the Student Records Office. If a student elects to withdraw from Mercy College by using a Wi thdrawal/Leave of Absence Request Form, he/she must obtain the form from the Student Records Office , complete the form and obtain a signature from his/her academic advisor , and return the completed form to the Student Records Office. If a student elects t o verbally notify the Student Records Office, he/she must provide an effective date of withdrawal Academic Affairs 138 and state that it is a complete withdrawal from the College. Please note that the withdrawal process may take up to ten business days. Requests for transcripts will not be processed until the withdrawal has been processed and financial obligations have been met. (See Return to Title IV and Leave of Absence in College Catalog). WITHDRAWAL DATES The withdrawal date will be determined by the College as : 1. The date the student begins the withdrawal process. 2. The midpoint of the semester if the student withdraws without notification to the College. OR 3. The student's last date of attendance in a course. The student transcript will indicate a \"W\" if the student completes the process prior to the last day to Withdraw according to the Add/Drop/Withdraw Table. After the last day to Withdraw, the student transcript will indicate a \"WP\" or \"WF\" depending on th e student's standing in the course. Coursework completed before withdrawal is forfeited. Any course withdrawal after the published deadline for the current term will receive a grade of \"WP\" (withdrawal pass) or \"WF\" (withdrawal fail). A grade of \"WP\" wi ll not affect grade point average; however, a grade of \"WF\" counts the same as an \"F\" and will be calculated in the grade point average. Students are not permitted to withdraw during finals week. (See Return to Title IV and Leave of Absence Policy in Col lege Catalog). COURSE WAIVER/ SUBSTIT UTION Students may request a course waiver/substitution based on previous work, or through standardized or departmental exams. A waiver/subs titution form must be completed and filed with the Student Records Office to ensure credit is awarded for any of the following situations: WAIVER The academic advisor/faculty member decides that the student has met the coursework in a particular area to meet a course requirement. The academic advisor/faculty member agrees to accept transfer credits for courses that are beyond the seven year time limit. The academic advisor approves a credit hour overload for the semester. SUBSTITUTION A student may request a course substitution (if an ap propriate substitution is available) when a required course in the student's program of study is no longer offered or is cancelled by the College and the inability to take this course will interfere with the student's academic progress and/or will prevent a timely graduation. It is assumed that the student is not responsible for this situation (i.e., the problem is not related to previous course failures or the student's decision not to follow the prescribed semester - by-semester curriculum plan). Academic Affairs 139 A stude nt may request a course substitution if (after the student's initial semester of matriculation) changes were made to an academic program by the College resulting in coursework completed by the student that is no longer required by the program of study. Th is is not intended to imply the existence of a \"grandfather\" clause, since the requirements of the relevant professional accreditation association must take precedence. A student must take the following into account when requesting a course substitution: > Proposed course substitutions must be consistent with the academic goals of the program. > Mercy College residency requirements must be followed. > No more than two course substitutions will apply to a student's academic program. > Students may substitute a higher level class for a lower level course requirement (e.g. Calculus for College Algebra). For a Mercy College of Ohio student to petition for a course waiver or a course substitution: 1. The student must obtain a Waiver/Substitution Form from the Student Records Office. 2. The student must complete the course information and justification for waiver/substitution. 3. The student must meet with his/her academic advisor/faculty member to review the request. If the pe tition is found to have merit, the advisor/faculty member signs off on the request. Subsequently, the student must obtain a signature from the Dean of the division where the course to be waived/substituted is offered. 4. When all required signatures have b een obtained, the student submits the form to the Student Records Office. 5. The Student Records Office distributes signed copies to the student and advisor/faculty member and places a copy in the student's permanent file. 6. The Student Records Office the n makes appropriate notations in the student database system. INDEPENDENT STUDY Students who want to complete an independent study must discuss the course proposal with the faculty member who is most knowledgeable of the subject ma tter being proposed. The faculty member and the Division Dean must both sign off on the independent study. One to three semester credit hours will be allowed per independent study (1 semester credit hour maximum if an associate degree student and 3 semes ter credit hour maximum if a bachelor degree student). Participating students must be in good academic standing with a GPA of 2.7 or better. Independent Study Proposal Forms and Guidelines/Learning Contract sheets are available through the Student Record s Office. Academic Affairs 140 CREDIT BY EXAMINATIO N Standardized or departmentally -prepared examinations may be taken for academic credit (per instructor's and Dean's approval). A student must obtain a grade of \"C\" or better, or a specific score based on College Board Exam criteria (Advanced Placement and CLEP). These examinations may be attempted if: 1. A student has not already audited or attended and failed the course at any college or university. 2. The faculty involved assess that the stude nt has sufficient knowledge either through prior work experiences or credits in closely related areas. Credit obtained by departmentally -prepared examinations will be recorded on the student's transcript with a \"K\" and will not be calculated in the studen t's grade point average.

Transfer Student Policy (See Enrollment Management) For the complete policy on transfer, see enrollment management in catalog - general admission. ADVANCED PLACEMENT ( AP), CLEP OR DSST CR EDIT Transfer credit may be granted for coursework completed at other institutions, advanced placement (AP) coursework, CLEP, or DSST (DANTES) (evaluated on an individual basis). Please refer to the Mercy College Credit by Examination (located on the website http://www.mercycollege.edu/my -mercy/student -records/credit -by-examination/ ) for specific details. Awarded transfer credit grades are reflected on the student's Mer cy College transcript; however, they are not reflected in the studen t's grade -point average (GPA). Students who have completed advanced placement courses while in high school may be eligible to receive college credit. The decision to grant credit, or to waive prerequisite coursework, is based on several factors including a review of records, scores on College Board Examinations or similar tests and official score reports from the College Board Advanced Placement Program. Academic Affairs 143 Final determination will be made by the Dean of the College division in consultation with program faculty. Transfer Credit Appeals P rocess (See Transfer Credit Policy in Enrollment Management) POST ENROLLMENT TRAN SFER OF CREDIT Students are encouraged to complete all of their coursework at the College once enrolled. The rationale for this policy rests in the mission and philosophy of the College, and in its concern for the essential unity and integrity of all aspects of the curriculum. After matriculating to Mercy College of Ohio and recognizing that students may ha ve compelling reasons for completing coursework at another institution, the College permits the transfer of up to six credit hours. This policy applies to the transfer of coursework after a student has initially enrolled at Mercy College. Such transfer i s subject to the following procedures and guidelines. 1. Students must be in good academic standing (maintaining an overall grade point average of 2.0 or better) to be eligible for taking courses at another college/university. 2. A Post -Enrollment Transfer Credit Form (can be obtained from the Student Records Office) with an attached copy of the catalog description from the institution where the student proposes to take the course. Additional documentation, such as a course syllabus, may be required. Prior to enrolling in the course, the form must be signed by the student's academic advisor/faculty member and Dean and subsequently submitted to the Student Records Office at Mercy College. 3. Only courses which have the prior approval of the academic advisor/ faculty member and Dean will be accepted for transfer credit. In addition, only courses with a grade of \"C\" or better will be accepted for transfer. 4. Students must meet the minimum residency requirements of Mercy College (see Residency Requirements in t he Enrollment Management area of the catalog ). GRADING SYSTEM Mercy College of Ohio will use the following system to calculate a student's grade point average (GPA): GRADE QUALITY POINTS ACHIEVEMENT A 4.0 points Excellent B 3.0 points Good C 2.0 points Satisfactory D 1.0 point Unsatisfactory F 0.0 points Failure I Incomplete K Credit by examination P Pass (no effect on grade point average; equal to \"C\" or better) AU Audit (no credit) Academic Affairs 144 NG No Grade reported per instructor at the time grades are due. NG grade will not affect the student's grade point average (GPA). R Repeated course - a student may be allowed to retake for credit a course in which a grade of less than \"C\" has been receive d. Only the second grade is computed in the cumulative GPA. Both grades will appear on the transcript. (See Course Repeat section for exceptions). W* Withdraw al prior to mid -term WA Withdrawal from an audited class WF Withdraw al failing at or following mid -term WP Withdraw al passing at or following mid -term *See Personal and Medical Leave of Absence Policy. The clinical component of nursing courses is graded satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on attainment of course objectiv es. An unsatisfactory grade in the clinical component constitutes a failure in the course. A satisfactory grade in the clinical component results in the grade obtained in the theory component of the course. GRADE REPORTS Grade reports are available onli ne through the EMPOWERME link. Students need to use their username and password to enter the system. Grade reports are not available to students who have outstanding account balances and who have not made arrangements for payment, or to students who have outstanding paperwork due to Student Services, or to students who have outstanding library book/fees. GRADE POINT AVERAGE A student's grade point average (GPA) is based on credit hours, grades awarded and quality points. The quality points for each cour se are calculated by multiplying the number of semester hours (1, 2, 3, etc.) by the number of quality points assigned to the grade received (A=4, B=3, etc.). The sum of the quality points received for all courses within a term is then divided by the numb er of semester credit hours attempted in that term. Courses withdrawn, transferred, or audited are not included in the total credit hours except in the case of a \"WF\" which is calculated as 0 points or an \"F\". CUMULATIVE GRADE POI NT AVERAGE Cumulative grade point average is based only on work completed while enrolled at Mercy College of Ohio. The cumulative GPA equals the sum of the quality points for all courses divided by the number of semester credit hours attempted. Courses from which a student has withdrawn prior to the last withdrawal date, as well as courses that were audited or taken at another institution, are not included in a student's Mercy College GPA. Grades of \"WF\" earned at Mercy College are included in the calculation. Academic Affairs 145 INCOMPLETE GRADE If a student is unable to complete all requirements, due to extenuating circumstances approved by the instructor, an incomplete may be issued. The incomplete will not be calculated into the grade point average. Inco mplete coursework must be completed within 10 class days of the next semester or the grade will be changed to an \"F\". Once the student has successfully completed the coursework, a change of grade will be completed by the instructor of reco rd. This grade will be reflected on the subsequent semester's grade report. Failure to complete specific courses may result in dismissal from the program if it interferes with required sequencing of coursework in the program of study. Exceptions may be granted by an in structor only in unusual circumstances and with the approval of the Vice President of Academic Affairs. NON -ACADEMIC DISMISSAL/G RADING If a student is dismissed for non -academic reasons, the student is eligible for the a ppropriate add/drop or withdrawal dates of each course depending on the date of the non -academic dismissal. If the student is dismissed during the add/drop period, he/she is dropped from his/her course(s). If the student is dismissed during the withdraw al period, he/she is withdrawn from all course(s) and receives a grade of \"W\". If the student is dismissed after the withdraw al time period he/she is withdrawn from all course(s) and receive s grades of \"WP\" or \"WF\" depending upon the student's grade at the time of the dismissal. (See Leav e of Absence Policy in College Catalog). CLASS LEVEL The number of semester hours used in determining a student's academic level is based on the cumulative semester hours earned at the end of a semester. A student's class status is based on cumulative ho urs earned (total transfer hours plus Mercy College of Ohio hours earned and/or completion of required courses for the appropriate year (i.e., level 1 courses must be completed prior to obtaining level 2 status). First Year: 0 -29.9 semester credit hours Second Year: 30 -59.9 semester credit hours Third Year: 60 -89.9 semester credit hours (Bachelor programs only) Fourth Year: 90+ semester credit hours (Bachelor programs only) ACADEMIC HONORS President's List A President's List is compiled each academic semester to honor students whose academic performance is outstanding.

Academic Affairs 175 NURSING - BACHELOR OF SCIENCE History From the inception of Mercy College in 1993, its strategic plan had included the eventual implementation of a baccalaureate program in nursing. In 1999, the Ohio Board of Nursing (OBN) and the Ohio Board of Regents ( now named Ohio Department of Higher Education ) granted program approval. In June 2000, The North Central Association of Colleges and Schools approved the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program. Both pre -licensure and Registered Nurse (RN) completion students were admitted for the first BSN classes in fall 2000. Philosophy The BSN faculty believes that the education of professional nurses must include the concepts around which nursing knowledge is structured: the individual, society, health, nursing and learning. The philosophy of the Division of Nursing is congruent with the philosophy of Mercy College of Ohio. The fa culty holds the following beliefs: Individual Based on fundamental Christian principles, sacredness of life and human dignity, the individual is viewed as a creature of God, composed of body and soul, endowed with intellect and free will from which stems a person's integrity as a unique individual. The individual is a complex being who has unique values, knowledge, beliefs and life experiences that influences their diverse healthcare needs. Society Society is an ever -changing, complex social system comp rised of unique individuals, families, groups, communities, and populations. The environment includes spiritual, physical, psychological, cultural, social, technological, economic, geographic, ecological and political forces. Changes in society, includin g an aging population, diverse family and community structures, increasing global interdependence, and economic and political changes influence the values and expectations placed upon healthcare professionals and institutions. The needs and influences of society impact the delivery of nursing care and the continued development of nursing roles that promote the well -being of others. The nursing program fulfills its responsibility to society by caring for the health needs of the diverse patient population. Faculty and students practice in multiple settings with patients across the lifespan. Academic Affairs 176 Health Health is a dynamic state of bio -psycho -social -spiritual function of a person, family, group or community, and is viewed on a continuum throughout the lifespan. All individuals have the right as well as a responsibility to maintain health based on their i nherent capabilities, depth of knowledge, growth and development, environment, culture, perception of needs, and the accessibility to resources. Nursing The professional nurse assumes the roles of provider of care, manager of care, and a member of the pro fession of nursing. Baccalaureate -prepared nurses provide patient -centered care that identifies, respects, and addresses patients' differences, values, preferences, knowledge, and expressed needs. The professional nurse provides direct care across all en vironments, including health promotion and risk reduction leading to clinical prevention; plus provides population -based healthcare. Professional nurses also design and implement measures to modify risk factors and promote healthy life styles in increasin g complex healthcare environments. As a designer, coordinator, and manager of care, the professional nurse is an active participant in the interprofessional team yet can also delegate, supervise and evaluate care of patients. Nurses are accountable for their professional practice as well as the outcomes of their own and delegated nursing care. As a member of the profession of nursing, the nurse can advocate for the patient and the profession of nursing. The profession of nursing requires therapeutic us e of self, critical thinking, problem solving, psychomotor skills, management of information, effective communication , and collaboration of skills. Learning Education is a life -long process through which learners develop knowledge, skills, and attitudes resulting in cognitive, affective, and psychomotor changes. Learning is a collaborative process in which the learner and faculty are active participants. Faculty members facilitate and promote learning in an environment, which fosters mutual trust, accou ntability, responsibility, self-expression, intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and creativity. Faculty members recognize that learners enrich this environment by bringing to it a diversity of backgrounds, age, education, and life experiences. The success of the learner is dependent upon self - motivation, active participation, and goal directed behavior in the planned curriculum experiences . Bachelor of Science Degree Nursing Education Program Baccalaureate degree nursing education is provided with in institutions of higher learning and prepares graduates with the knowl edge, skills, and values needed to practice nursing with competence, compassion, and integrity. Baccalaureate nursing is dependent on understanding and integrating general education, liberal arts, biological sciences, social sciences, and the interrelationship among theory, practice, and research. Academic Affairs 177 Baccalaureate nurses are prepared as nurse generalist to function as providers, designers, and managers, of patient care across the healthca re continuum. They are responsible for delegation to and supervision of supportive healthcare works and for collaboration with other members of the healthcare team. Professional Development Changes in healthcare and the role of baccalaureate nurse gener alist mandates that graduates are prepared for flexibility and career mobility. Their nursing education must provide the basis for self -evaluation of practice, both formal and informal. Furthermore, the nursing program must instill professionalism and pr ofessional values, the appreciation for life -long personal and professional development, and the integration of evidence based practice. Program Learning Outcomes The baccalaureate program of study is further based on sound principles of adult education progressing from simple to complex, familiar to unfamiliar, and general to specific. The Program provides students with the opportunity to achieve program objectives through the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, and competencies necessary to functi on as professional nurses who meet the healthcare needs of individuals across the lifespan. The following student learning outcomes emphasize Christian values, critical thinking, clinical competence , and professional development: 1. Demonstrate knowledg e of liberal education (Arts and sciences) in making clinical judgments for diverse populations with complex health problems. 2. Demonstrate leadership skills, quality improvement, and patient safety in caring for populations with complex health problems . 3. Demonstrate ability to participate in basic nursing research by sharing evidence -based nursing practices with the inter -professional healthcare team. 4. Employ knowledge and skills of information management in patient care technology. 5. Apply principles of legal, ethical and economic policy related to influencing healthcare delivery and practice. 6. Effectively communicate and collaborate with interdisciplinary professionals to deliver evidence based, patient -centered care. 7. Provide thera peutic nursing interventions that assist populations, communities, groups, and individuals across the life span whose lives are affected by, illness, distress, disease, disability or death. 8. Incorporate professional behavior, the commitment to lifelong learning, and professional values, including legal and ethical aspects into the practice of nursing. 9. Integrate holistic care to a diverse population in a variety of healthcare settings.

Academic Affairs 206 NURSING - ASSOCIATE OF SCIENCE (DAY AND EVENING/WEE KEND) Overview Associate degree nursing education which occurs in institutions of higher learning prepares the graduate with the values, knowledge and skills needed to practice nursing with integrity and professional competence. Associate degree nursing education, in conjunction with integration of knowledge from other disciplines, provides a broad theoretical base in nursing, related sciences and general studies; knowledge of the role of the associate degree nurse; the ability to practice in multiple settings; and a foundation for advanced nursing study. An essential component of nursing education is the concurrent integration of theory into the clinical practice se tting. The graduate is prepared to function as a manager of care in acute and long -term settings where policies and procedures are specified and guidance is available. Upon completion of the degree, students are eligible to sit for the National Council L icensure Exam for Registered Nurses (NCLEX -RN) to practice as a registered nurse . History The Mercy College of Ohio nursing program has a rich heritage of compassionate care and excellence in nursing education. More than 3,000 nurses were educated through Mercy School of Nursing, founded in 1918 by the Sisters of Mercy. That program, which led to the Diploma in Nursing, evolved into the current Associate of Science in Nursing Degree program. Philosophy Individu al Based on fundamental Catholic principles, sacredness of life and human dignity, the individual is viewed as a creature of God, composed of body and soul, endowed with intellect and free will from which stems a person's dignity and integrity as a unique individual. Each individual has the right to be treated with respect and dignity. The individual is a complex being who has unique values, beliefs and life experiences that influence self -care behavior. Individuals have vast resources for self -directed behavior enabling them to make d ecisions, set goals and take action to promote, maintain and restore health. Society Society is a complex social system comprised of unique individuals, groups, families and communities existing within a changing environment. The environment includes spi ritual, physical, psychological, cultural, social, technological, economic, geographic, ecological political forces. Changes in society influence the values and expectations placed upon healthcare professionals and institutions. The needs and influences of society impact the delivery of nursing care and the continued development of nursing roles that promote the well -being of others. Academic Affairs 207 The nursing program fulfills its community responsibility by developing an awareness of health needs and resources within the community. The program prepares graduates to establish a milieu of trust and to promote the fundamental rights and responsibilities of members of society within the evolving healthcare delivery systems. Faculty and students practice in multiple setti ngs with individuals across the lifespan. Health Health is a dynamic state of bio -psycho -social -spiritual functioning of a person, family, group, or community and is viewed on a continuum throughout the lifespan. All individuals have the right as well as a responsibility to maintain health based on their inherent capabilities, depth of knowledge, growth and development, environment, culture, perception of needs and the accessibility to resources. The deliberative actions that individuals, families, group s and communities take to maintain an optimal state of health are designated as self -care. When self - care actions are not sufficient to maintain health, a self -care deficit results, necessitating nursing interventions. Nursing Nursing is a human service directed toward the achievement of self -care. As a human service, nursing involves acting with compassion and care to assist, guide, support, provide a developmental environment and teach individuals, families and communities. The nurse and patient form a healthcare relationship. The patient presents deficits in self -care and the nurse identifies self -care demands based on a holistic assessment of the patient. The nurse, working within established legal, ethical and professional standards, provides serv ices designed to increase the self -care agency of individuals, families and communities. The nurse uses nursing process as the methodology to provide these services. Learning Education is a lifelong process through which learners develop knowledge, skill s and attitudes resulting in cognitive, affective and psychomotor changes. Learning is a reciprocal process in which the learner and faculty are active and willing participants. Faculty members facilitate and promote learning in an environment which fost ers mutual trust, accountability, responsibility, self -expression, intellectual curiosity, critical thinking and creativity. Faculty members recognize that learners enrich this environment by bringing to it a diversity of backgrounds, age, education, and life experiences. The success of the learner is dependent upon self -motivation, active participation and goal directed behavior in the planned curriculum experiences. Associate Degree Nursing Education Program Associate degree nursing education which occ urs in institutions of higher learning prepares the graduate with the values, knowledge and skills needed to practice nursing with integrity and professional competence. Academic Affairs 208 Associate degree nursing education, in conjunction with integration of knowledge from other disciplines, provides a broad theoretical base in nursing, related sciences and general studies; knowledge of the role of the associate degree nurse; the ability to practice in multiple settings; and a foundation for advanced nursing study. An esse ntial component of nursing education is the concurrent integration of theory into the clinical practice setting. The graduate is prepared to function as a manager of care in acute and long -term settings where policies and procedures are specified and guid ance is available. As a member of the health team, this graduate is also able to collaborate with other nursing and health team members and to provide guidance to less skilled workers in the delivery of nursing care. Professional Development The faculty is committed to quality associate degree education through a curriculum that allows for flexibility, career mobility and professional development. Responding to the diverse backgrounds and needs of the learner population, the curriculum provid es a strong academic base for nursing practice as well as future career mobility. Educational mobility encourages lifelong personal and professional development. The faculty is responsible for planning, implementing and evaluating the nursing education p rogram. Faculty must be academically prepared, proficient in practice, knowledgeable about student needs and aware of changes in nursing practice, healthcare and nursing education. Faculty serves as role models, resource persons and teachers in classroom and practicum settings. Program Student Learning Outcomes The program student learning outcomes identify behaviors that are to be demonstrated by the graduate. Derived from the mission, philosophy and organizing framework, they are: 1. Apply the nursing process in assisting the patient to meet self -care requisites. 2. Integrate health -illness concepts in the provision of care. 3. Synthesize concepts of the teaching/learning process in the delivery of care. 4. Demonstrate accountability and professional b ehavior in entry level associate degree nursing practice. 5. Using the concepts of the Self -Care Deficit Theory of Nursing, formulate plans of care for patients across the life span. 6. Integrate knowledge of the humanities, sciences and nursing research t o provide rationale for nursing practice. 7. Demonstrate the consistent performance of safe, effective nursing skills in entry level associate degree practice. 8. Demonstrate interpersonal skills throughout nursing practice. 9. Practice Christian values wi thin the ethical, legal and professional standards of nursing practice. Academic Affairs 209 Admission Requirements An applicant must be a high school graduate with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.7 or a general equivalency diploma (GED) recipient with a score of 57 0 (score of 57 prior to 2002). If an applicant's GPA or GED score is below the minimum, he/she may be eligible for admission under transfer student guidelines. Transfer Student Guidelines A transfer student must be a high school graduate or a GED recipient and have earned a minimum of 15 credit hours of college coursework from a regionally accredited college, with a GPA of at least 2.7. For applicants who have attended more than one region ally accredited college, GPAs from all colleges must combine to equal at least 2.7. The ASN pre -licensure nursing program Admission's Committee will not consider an applicant for admission into the program if an applicant has failed two or more nursing co urses or has been dismissed from another nursing program in the past five (5) years prior to the expected date of enrollment at Mercy College. The student's entire academic record will be reviewed in selecting candidates for the program. Research demons trates that students with multiple science and/or math course failures are more at risk for being unsuccessful in a nursing program. Because of the competitive nature of the nursing program, previous course failures within the required program of study in the past seven (7) years prior to the expected date of enrollment at Mercy College might prevent an applicant's acceptance into the program. Admission into the nursing program is not guaranteed. Using the Mercy Pledge The ASN Program faculty supports th e Mercy Pledge by allowing a student to take 15 hours of substantive coursework, preferably in the program of study, to show he/she is capable of achieving the necessary GPA required for admission consideration. However, it is important to note that the a pplicant's entire academic record will be reviewed in selecting candidates for the program, and the applicant's cumulative GPA will be used in this process. Research demonstrates that students with multiple science and/or math course failures are more at risk for being unsuccessful in a nursing program. Because of the competitive nature of the nursing program, previous course failures in the required program of study in the past seven (7) years prior to the expected date of enrollment at Mercy College migh t prevent an applicant's acceptance into the program. Admission into the nursing program is not guaranteed. If the criteria exclude an applicant from admission, the applicant can appeal in writing to the Nursing APG Committee for consideration.
