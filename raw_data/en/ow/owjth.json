Ayush is an umbrella term for relatively popular medicine systems outside allopathy. It encompasses dissimilar approaches such as ayurveda and homeopathy. Integrating allopathy with alternative approaches under the banner of integrative medicine has a long history. Long enough to spawn multiple dedicated journals. However, the equation remains uneasy as there are significant differences in the underlying approach to treatment. Integrative medicine represents an attempt to go beyond dealing with symptoms. This makes practitioners of modern medicine wary because their system rests on standardisation. That discomfiture has however not deterred attempts at integration as research suggests that there is complementarity, particularly when it comes to picking adjunctive therapy to cope with symptoms such as chronic pain. For example, in 2012, doctors at AIIMS started research to see where yoga could effectively complement conventional treatment. The main fault-line between different approaches is the importance of randomised controlled trials in allopathy to establish the safety and efficacy of treatments. Other therapies don't easily lend themselves to RCTs, inducing a level of scepticism among doctors. Alternative therapies have survived the test of time and are often used in India by patients who also have access to allopathy. It's not uncommon to find patients taking recourse to more than one kind of treatment. Given that, carrying out more research in these fields makes sense. However, it's important that regulatory authorities curb misinformation on efficacy and risks. There are no magic cures. Alternative medicine shouldn't lead to regulatory laxity.
