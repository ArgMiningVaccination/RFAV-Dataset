Read all about it here.", "sitename": "Dogs Naturally", "date": "2020-08-20", "cleaned_text": "Your dog starts limping suddenly. And when it doesn't get better, you take him to the vet for x-rays. You were expecting an exercise injury or maybe some arthritis. But, after x-rays and maybe other tests, your vet tells you it's osteosarcoma ... an aggressive bone cancer in dogs. It's a terrible shock, of course. And if it happens to you, you'll have some important decisions to make for your dog. So we'll provide as much information as we can, to help you make the best decisions for your dog's care. Well you what treatments conventional vets recommend. But we'll also mention some natural alternatives that can really support your dog's own healing. Natural therapies may help preserve his quality of life better than conventional treatments. There's also some important research being done. Some studies offer hope that there will be better solutions for dogs with bone cancer in the future. What Is Osteosarcoma Osteosarcoma is the most common form of bone cancer in dogs. 85% of bone cancer patients have osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma tumors can be in any bone in the body ... but are most often in the long bones of the limbs. Front legs are more likely to get osteosarcoma than hind legs. Osteosarcoma tumors are often at the end of the bone. This is what differentiates them from secondary bone cancers. Secondary cancers have spread from other cancer types and they're usually in the middle of the bone. The most common locations for osteosarcoma tumors are: - Towards the knee, away from the elbow - The top of the shoulder (top of the humerus bone) - The wrist (bottom of the radius bone) - Bottom of the tibia, at the ankle or hock joint Osteosarcoma tumors are fast-growing. So they can spread or metastasize quickly to other body parts. - 10 to 15% of dogs with osteosarcoma already have some lung metastasis when they're diagnosed. - But 90% of dogs already have micrometastasis ... meaning the cancer has spread but doesn't show up on X-rays. That's important to keep in mind when considering surgical options. Even if the primary bone tumor is removed (through amputation) ... micrometastases will grow. These are often the eventual cause of death in osteosarcoma patients. And it's why conventional vets recommend chemotherapy. What Causes Osteosarcoma? Osteosarcoma causes are a bit of an unknown ... but here are some of the possibilities. Microfractures One theory is that over time, your dog's body weight may cause small microfractures in his long bones. These over-stimulate bone growth and inflammation ... creating increased risk of malignancies. Radiation Radiation therapy (for other types of cancer) can sometimes trigger osteosarcoma. This isn't common, but can happen in up to 5% of patients, about 3-5 years after radiation treatments. Trauma Bone trauma like fractures or infections may also cause osteosarcoma at a later date. If your dog had a fracture repaired with a metal plate, that's another possible cause. Early Spay/Neuter Early spay/neuter is also a risk factor. [One study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12433723/) showed that Rottweilers spayed or neutered before 1 year old were 3-4 times more likely to develop osteosarcoma. Another study found that spayed or neutered purebred dogs have more than double the risk of intact dogs. Genetics Your dog's genes may also be a factor. Certain breeds (see below) are more prone to osteosarcoma. And some genes have been implicated: p53, retinoblastoma , PTEN , and possibly c-Kit. Fluoride [Fluoride](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/is-fluoride-bad-for-dogs/) in drinking water may also be a contributing factor, especially in males. There's research linking fluoridated water to osteosarcoma in growing boys and male rats. So, logically, it may be the case for dogs too. Dogs Prone To Osteosarcoma Taller, heavier dogs are at higher risk for osteosarcoma, especially in the front legs. - Dogs over 66 lbs are 60 times more likely to get osteosarcoma than dogs under 22 lbs. - In dogs over 88 lbs, 95% of primary bone cancer is osteosarcoma. - In dogs under 33 lbs, that number drops to 40-50%. Size is a more important factor than breed ... but these are some of the breeds at risk for the disease. - Great Danes - St Bernards - Irish Setters - Dobermans - Rottweilers - German Shepherds - Golden Retrievers Scottish Deerhounds are genetically predisposed to osteosarcoma as well. Middle age is another factor. Osteosarcoma is often found in dogs from 2 to 10 years of age, but the median age is 7. Signs Of Osteosarcoma One of the difficulties in recognizing osteosarcoma is that dogs are so good at hiding lameness. And the signs of osteosarcoma are easy to confuse with other diseases. But key symptoms are ... - Persistent lameness - Swelling In early stages, most dogs won't have other symptoms. They'll otherwise feel okay. So if your dog's pain doesn't improve with rest or pain remedies, talk to your vet. Other signs as the cancer develops may include ... - Lack of appetite - Lethargy - Difficulty breathing or coughing - in later stages of lung metastasis - Severely increased lameness, suggesting the bone has fractured (rare, but it can happen) Bloodwork won't usually alert you to osteosarcoma ... but one change may be increased ALP (alkaline phosphatase, a liver enzyme). And there are many things that could cause that. However, elevated ALP is a factor in prognosis, as you'll see later. Diagnosing Osteosarcoma In Dogs Again, if your dog has lameness that doesn't go away; or there's swelling in the limbs ... see your vet. The first step will be a physical exam and x-rays. Your vet will want to rule out other causes for the lameness. X-rays will show lesions typical of osteosarcoma. Avoid Bone Aspirate or Biopsy To confirm suspected osteosarcoma, some vets may do a bone aspirate or bone biopsy. But it's best to avoid these diagnostic tools if you can. They may ... - Increase metastasis - Weaken the bone further - Increase pain And the results may not change your treatment decisions. Oncologist Susan Ettinger DVM Dip ACVIM (Oncology, co-author of The Dog Cancer Survival Guide, says if she sees lesions that look like osteosarcoma, she skips the biopsy or aspirate and recommends immediate surgery. That's because bone lesions can't be repaired. They also create risk of a painful fracture. In that case, a biopsy could be done after amputation. For a bone aspirate, your dog will be sedated. It's less likely to cause a bone fracture than a biopsy. But it can be inconclusive as to the type of sarcoma. In that case, a special stain to test for ALP in the aspirate can confirm an osteosarcoma diagnosis. A negative result does not rule out osteosarcoma, however. Bone biopsies remove a piece of the bone for testing; but that creates risk of fracture. They can also lead to misdiagnosis in 50% of cases. So if you decide on a biopsy, make sure you find an experienced surgeon. The sample should come from the middle of the bone, not the edges. I'll get into discussion about surgeries for osteosarcoma a bit later. After osteosarcoma diagnosis ... The next step will be to check for metastasis. That's usually done via chest X-rays. Your vet may also look for micro-metastasis with a CT scan. (CT scans are expensive and require anesthesia.) Other tests may include: - Full blood panel (CBC and chemistry) - Urinalysis - Lymph node aspirate or biopsy to check for metastasis (not common, but affects prognosis) - Additional X-rays if your dog is lame in other areas - Abdominal ultrasound to evaluate overall health Rule Out Fungal Disease It's also important to rule out fungal infections, which can look like osteosarcoma. So if you live somewhere where diseases like blastomycosis are common, you may need to do a bone biopsy after all ... to identify fungal infection. There may be a difference in symptoms too. With blastomycosis, your dog will likely feel sick, with symptoms like ... - Fever - Weight loss - Coughing - Depression - Eye problems - Lameness - Skin issues Staging Of Osteosarcoma While oncologists usually \"stage\" cancers ... this may not be useful for osteosarcomas. That's because so many of them are already advanced (with metastasis) at diagnosis. - Stage I - low-grade tumors without metastasis - Stage II - high-grade tumors without metastasis - Stage III - metastasis has occurred Staging osteosarcoma isn't likely to change your treatment decision (whatever that turns out to be). Conventional vets love citing statistics and giving you prognosis estimates. They'll likely tell you the expected survival times for various treatment options. Other than treatment decisions, some factors that affect prognosis are: - Tumor size and metastasis - High ALP levels (indicate shorter survival times) - Tumor location (may affect metastasis) But instead of worrying about exactly when your dog might die ... it's best to focus your energy on giving your dog the best quality of life for however much time he has left. There are all kinds of dogs who defy the odds and have much longer survival times than the experts predicted. So, speaking of quality of life, let's talk about some treatment options. Treatments To Consider You'll have some difficult decisions to make. And the first one is a very big one. Amputation/Surgery Except in rare cases, conventional vets and oncologists will recommend surgery plus chemotherapy for osteosarcoma. Surgery usually involves amputation of the limb. So you'll have a 3-legged dog. And this is probably the only instance you'll see where DNM says \"it's OK to amputate.\" Removing the limb removes much of the cancer (depending on the level of metastasis). And it also removes the pain. Eliminating the pain is obviously a huge factor in your dog's quality of life. But not all dogs do well with amputation. So it's an individual decision. Many dogs are fine hopping around, even running and playing, on 3 legs. Dogs often adapt very quickly to amputation ... because the pain has already caused them to shift their weight to the other 3 legs. Before amputating, ask your vet to test ... to see how well your dog bears weight on the opposite leg. If your dog has compromised mobility in other limbs, it may not be a good choice for him. Severe arthritis, neurological problems, or lameness in another leg, could mean he won't do well as a tripod dog. In that case there are \"limb-sparing\" procedures that some dogs may qualify for. Limb-Sparing Surgery These are complicated and expensive procedures. And not every hospital can do them. But it could be a solution for your dog. It involves removing only the affected part of the bone ... then replacing it with bone from a donor. The \"donor\" could be your dog himself. Your dog may be a candidates for limb sparing procedure if he has ... - Osteosarcoma in less than 50% of the bone - Limited soft tissue involvement - No fractures - Lesion that doesn't wrap around the whole bone There can be complications like infections or fractures with these procedures. And the cancer is more likely to recur than with amputation. There may be one more alternative to surgery. Stereotactic Radiation (SRS/SRT) This is an advanced radiation therapy that some oncology clinics offer. It may be an option if your dog hasn't already lost a lot of bone. Because SRS/SRT is highly focused, it can damage and kill osteosarcoma cells ... but without doing too much damage to surrounding healthy cells. It may also relieve your dog's pain. Conventional oncologists still recommend chemotherapy after SRS/SRT. The Surgery Decision It's a very difficult decision. Of course, you must consider your dog's ability to walk on 3 legs.If you talk to holistic vets, you'll get varying responses about amputation. In the conventional approach, removing the cancer is part of the solution. But the [holistic approach treats the whole dog](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/holistic-cancer-treatment-for-dogs/) with alternative therapies. By supporting your dog's overall health, you may be able to stop the tumor from growing. And your dog is more likely to maintain good quality of life than with toxic drug treatments. [Dr Judy Jasek](http://ahavet.com/), who specializes in alternative treatments for cancer patients, believes that the main reason to amputate is for pain management. Because cancer is a systemic disease, removing the tumor doesn't treat the cancer. Most of Dr Jasek's osteosarcoma patients aren't amputated. Instead, Dr Jasek supports the dog with diet and other therapies (that we'll get into below). Chemotherapy And Radiation Follow up chemotherapy and/or radiation is always recommended as part of the surgical option ... and it's what conventional vets recommend, even if you don't do surgery. And the chemotherapy statistics they give you may be compelling: - With just amputation dogs have a median survival time of 4-5 months. - 90% succumb within a year; just 2% survive to 2 years. - Amputation plus chemotherapy offers median survival times of 10 months to 1 year. - 20-25% of dogs survive for 2 years. But chemo drugs have many severe side effects. Even the actual treatments can be painful ... and stressful for your dog. Radiation treatment is used to lessen pain and can be very effective. And a third drug treatment, bisphosphonates (pamidronate) may help in bone remodeling. It can also control pain and may have anti-cancer effects. But the list of side effects is massive. You can [read it online](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/pamidronate-side-effects.html). It's a new treatment, so there's not much information about its results. We don't know whether it buys your dog more time. Deciding On Drug Treatments First, here's a paragraph about these treatments from Dr Marty Goldstein's book, The Nature Of Animal Healing. Dr Goldstein discusses the significant harmful side effects of these treatments. What he says next may be helpful to you as you consider these treatments. \"...even if the tumor is eradicated through chemo or radiation, where does that leave the pet? In a lesser state of health than the one he was in before their debilitating effects. [...] To me, the only rationale for either of these treatments is to accomplish initial treatment of a cancer condition that is life-threatening, or when the statistics for success leading to healthier, prolonged lives support it for that cancer type.\" Dr Goldstein cautions against invasive therapies. He may use them occasionally, but only when necessary for the patient ... and then, for as little time as possible. Dr Jasek also says she sees much better success in dogs who haven't had conventional therapies like chemo and radiation. Patients who've had these treatments go downhill faster. That's because chemo destroys the immune system. There are always cancer cells that escape chemo or radiation ... and then they come back with a vengeance. Chemo offers good short term results but bad long term outcomes. Dr Jasek supports people's choices and will still do supportive care, even for dogs who are getting chemo. But she warns \"I can't treat chemo side effects, because it destroys the microbiome.\" And Dr Ian Billinghurst explains that although these treatments may seem to work initially ... cancer will always come back. \"And when this cancer in its new format makes its obnoxious reappearance, it is always more malignant, more aggressive and far less responsive to chemotherapy than the horror it replaced.\" Here's what Dr Ian Billinghurst has to say about [chemo and radiation](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/chemo-radiation-for-dogs/) treatments. So ... be sure to explore all the options before making a decision. Some holistic therapies may be just as effective as the toxic drug options in prolonging your dog's quality of life. Alternative Therapies Homeopathy Homeopathy can be highly successful in treating all kinds of cancers. Instead of attacking the cancer as a separate entity, homeopathy supports the body's own healing ability. [Dr Charles Loops](http://www.charlesloopsdvm.com/) is a homeopathic veterinarian who specializes in cancer cases. He's had a lot of experience with osteosarcoma. Here are some highlights of his recommendations. - Limit diagnostics to X-rays. Osteosarcoma has a very characteristic appearance. - Avoid biopsies, which can increase metastasis as well as pain - Amputation is not fully curative because of metastasis - But he recommends amputation if your dog has 3 good legs Dr Loops' experience with osteosarcoma shows: - Survival times with amputation plus homeopathy are similar to amputation plus chemo. He sees dogs surviving for 1-2 years. Some live 3 years and others are even cured. So ... homeopathy can be just as effective as chemo at prolonging your dog's life. But without the harmful side effects, without the stressful vet visits ... and at much lower financial cost. Dr Loops uses a combination of homeopathic remedies, with frequent potency changes, and frequent dosing. He'll prescribe ... - Your dog's constitutional remedy - A remedy relating to the tumor and its location - He may add a third remedy that addresses genetic and environmental cancer causes. In February 2017, Dr Loops wrote on his website about dogs he was treating at the time: - Seven dogs living past the two-year mark, post-diagnosis, with treatment using his homeopathic protocol. - Three of the seven dogs have exceeded three years. - Six other dogs are in the six month to 1 year range, post-diagnosis, and are still free of metastasis and are expected to continue doing well. Most of these dogs have had amputations. \"Of the twenty-five to thirty dogs I treat each year, and with the varying tumor locations and start times for beginning homeopathic treatment post-diagnosis, I expect a 20-25% potential survival rate of at least two years with my future cases.\" These survival times are at least as good as chemotherapy results. And again, with no adverse side effects. With homeopathy, your dog may have a longer and better life, with less stress and discomfort, than with chemo. [Read more detail from Dr Loops about osteosarcoma treatment.](http://www.charlesloopsdvm.com/articles/osteosarcoma-1) TCVM Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine can also offer good results with osteosarcoma. A TCVM practitioner will use a combination of treatments: - Acupuncture - Herbal therapy - Food therapy Osteosarcoma can present as stagnant toxic heat. Toxic heat is particularly common in mid to late-stage cancer patients. Food therapy ingredients for toxic heat include green leafy vegetables, gizzards, white fish, turkey, rabbit, yucca, and winter squash. Chinese herbs might include Wu Wei Xiao Du Yin (Five Ingredient Decoction to Eliminate Toxin) or Ba Zheng Tang. A good TCVM practitioner can help extend and maintain your dog's quality of life with a combination of therapies. In some cases, TCVM therapy can have better results than conventional treatment. IV Vitamin C [IV vitamin C](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/ras/ras-central/blog/2020/yun-cantley-vitamin-c) is becoming more popular, especially with holistic practitioners. It can be used successfully to support cancer patients. There's some controversy because of past conflicting research (in human cases). Nonetheless, some holistic vets say it can perform miraculous turnarounds in serious medical conditions. The therapy is individually tailored to the patient's condition. It may include several days of treatment. Smith Ridge Veterinary Center is one clinic that uses this therapy extensively. Ozone Therapy Several holistic practitioners use ozone therapy for cancer. Dr Judy Jasek uses it successfully with osteosarcoma patients. Dr Marty Goldstein also describes in his book how ozone turned around osteosarcoma treatment results for many patients. Medical grade ozone is made by passing pure oxygen through a generator that uses an electrical spark to split an oxygen atom off of the O2 molecules. This free oxygen atom will combine with other O2 molecules and produce O3, which is ozone. Your dog can have the treatments at the vet clinic. Some vets (like Dr Jasek) will rent you an ozone generator to use at home, Pulsed Electromagnetic Therapy (PEMF) Finding a PEMF practitioner may benefit your osteosarcoma dog. PEMF sends a magnetic pulse through the body. It increases circulation, oxygen absorption and protein synthesis in the cells. It can heal damaged tissues, reduce pain and stimulate organs. There is some early research to show how PEMF can help cancer patients. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5119968/) of PEMF benefits on cancer found that PEMF slowed tumor growth in various types of cancers. PEMF also has immunomodulatory effects. [Another study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28064222/) showed it increased the effects of doxorubicin chemotherapy in mice with osteosarcoma. It's a very safe therapy. It can be expensive to buy the equipment, though it is available for home use. But you can often find local holistic practitioners who offer PEMF therapy. Herbs And Supplements It's best to find a holistic practitioner with osteosarcoma experience to help you choose the right herbs and supplements for your dog. But here are some things that can help. Mistletoe Dr Judy Jasek uses injectable mistletoe in her practice. Mistletoe has several therapeutic benefits. - Prevents tumor metastasis - Causes cancer cell death - Improves mitochondria health - Reduces tumor blood supply - Stimulates the immune system - Reduces pain Mistletoe can also reduce side effects of chemotherapy and radiation. You can learn to give subcutaneous mistletoe injections yourself at home. Medicinal Mushrooms A good organic medicinal [mushroom blend](https://market.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/collections/medicinal-mushrooms/products/immunity-medicinal-mushroom-blend) can really support your dog's cancer-fighting ability,, Beta-glucans are the main medicinal property in mushrooms. Beta-glucans have many benefits ... and boosting immunity is a big one. Make sure you buy a product made from whole mushrooms ... not mycelium. Many mushroom supplements are just mycelium. That's only part of the mushroom. Mycelium is grown on grains. Mycelium grown on grains is higher in starch and lower in important beta glucans than whole mushrooms. If you buy a mushroom blend made for dogs, follow the dosing directions on the label. If it's made for humans, assume the dose is for 150 lbs and adjust for your dog's weight. A mushroom blend can do a lot to support your dog's immune system. But you may want to add one extra mushroom for your dog. Turkey Tail Mushrooms (Coriolus versicolor or Trametes versicolor) Even if your mushroom supplement blend already includes turkey tail ... giving extra [turkey tail mushrooms](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/mushrooms-and-hemangiosarcoma/) can help fight cancer. [Turkey tail mushrooms](https://thenaturaldogstore.com/products/four-leaf-rover-turkey-tail-mushrooms) have been shown to help cancer patients in several studies of different kinds of cancer. One study in dogs even showed it can increase survival times for dogs with deadly hemangiosarcoma. CBD A good [full-spectrum CBD oil](https://thenaturaldogstore.com/products/cbd-oil-for-dogs) can be a good addition to your dog's osteosarcoma regimen. Buy a 1000 mg strength and give it once or twice daily. There are a few ways CBD can help your dog with osteosarcoma. - Manage your dog's pain - Reduce inflammation [Combat nausea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165951/)(especially important if you're doing chemo) [Inhibit growth of cancer cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20859676/) [Prevent or slow metastasis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22776349/) While there don't appear to be studies specific to CBD and osteosarcoma or bone cancer in dogs, cannabinoids can help manage other cancer types. And there's ample anecdotal evidence of [CBD helping dogs with cancer.](https://market.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/products/cbd-oil-for-dogs) One 10 year old dog with osteosarcoma had been given 1 month to live. After getting CBD, she could stop her [pain medications](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/dog-pain-meds-dont-work/) ... and she stopped limping. She lived another 6 months, without other treatments. And she was active until the very end of her life. Other Herbs Australian company McDowell's makes several herbal blends for dogs with cancer, including one for [osteosarcoma](https://shop.mcdowellsherbal.com/catalog/product/view/id/2889/s/osteosarcoma-aih/category/82/). It includes equisetum and elecampane, both of which are known as bone healing herbs. You may want to talk to your herbalist about whether this combination is right for your dog. They also have chemotherapy and radiation support formulas, in case you decide to do either of those treatments. Hands-on And Energy Therapies Hands-on therapies can improve your dog's quality of life. These therapies can be especially helpful for dogs with amputations whose bodies need to adjust to walking on 3 legs. Check into treatments like ... - Chiropractic - Physical therapy/rehab - Massage - Acupressure [Reiki](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/reiki-for-dogs-5-techniques-you-can-use-at-home/) - Whole Energy Body Balance Even meditating with your dog can be helpful ... to both of you ... during the stress of going through cancer. Promise For Future Treatments There's more research than you'd expect into osteosarcoma in dogs. That may be because [recent research](https://now.tufts.edu/news-releases/study-reveals-genetic-similarities-osteosarcoma-between-dogs-and-children) has shown similarities between osteosarcoma in children and dogs ... so they're using dogs to study new treatment options for children. So this may offer hope of some better treatment options in future ... for dogs too. Immunotherapy Some immunotherapies are already being done in osteosarcoma treatments for dogs. Immunotherapy means stimulating the immune system to fight the cancer cells. One therapy involves inhaling interleukin-2 liposomes. It's been successful in treating dogs with advanced lung metastasis. Another immunotherapy called L-MTP-PE shows promise but is not yet commercially available. But it may increase survival times to 15 months. One dog got [immunotherapy treatment](https://now.tufts.edu/articles/hope-dogs-bone-cancer) at Tufts University. First he had his leg amputated. Then he got 4 rounds of chemo, followed by 3 experimental injections. The immunotherapy triggers the body to hunt down bone-cancer cells. Almost a year later, he had no metastasis and was still cancer-free. (But he did have to go through amputation and chemo!) Another osteosarcoma immunotherapy experiment involves using drug combinations to target the tumor \"microenvironment.\" They're using the chemo drug Doxorubicin with the allergy drug Apoquel ... and a drug called Iadarixin. That's a drug that inhibits CXCR1/2 chemokine receptors. This is another suppressive, chemotherapy-type combination that suppresses the immune system. Cryosurgery Cryotherapy is a technique used to \"freeze\" cancer tumors. The body then rejects the frozen tissue. It's less invasive and less painful than regular surgery. It can also help stimulate the immune system. There's anecdotal evidence that cryotherapy of a primary tumor can activate the patient's own immune system. That can eradicate tumor cells far from the site of where the primary tumor was frozen. However, cryosurgery is currently only useful for bone cancer that's in the jaw, with exposed bone. It's difficult to use it for internal osteosarcoma of the long bones. However there is research now into [MRI-guided cryosurgery for dogs](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology/_documents/cigat/cryotherapy-STING-OSA-clinical-trial.pdf). So this may be a better possibility for osteosarcoma patients in future. Vaccines While we usually recommend avoiding vaccines at DNM ... life-threatening disease can change your perspective. So here are some studies taking place. One osteosarcoma dog received a [vaccine made from her own tumor](https://phys.org/news/2020-06-canine-bone-cancer-successfully-vaccine.html) at University of Missouri. She's still doing well 3 years later. [University of Florida](http://VM-ClinicalStudies@ufl.edu/) is also studying an osteosarcoma vaccine. They're recruiting dogs who have osteosarcoma, but have not received any chemo. To participate contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). The Mason Lab at University of Pennsylvania, is evaluating a vaccine. The goal is to stimulate the body's immune system to recognize and kill osteosarcoma cancer cells. It's an attenuated bacterial (Listeria monocytogenes) vaccine, genetically modified to express the HER-2/neu tumor protein that's expressed in osteosarcoma cancer cells. And another osteosarcoma vaccine may soon become available. Aratana Therapeutics announced that their Canine Osteosarcoma Vaccine, LiveListeriaVector (AT-014), has been granted a conditional license by the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics. In their preliminary study, 18 dogs dogs had amputation followed by chemotherapy, followed by the vaccine every 3 weeks for 3 doses. The median survival rate was 956 days with the vaccine, vs 423 days in a historical control group. Common side effects included lethargy, diarrhea, and fever. 4 serious adverse events were reported in a separate field safety study. Dogs with osteosarcoma who have undergone amputation and chemotherapy are eligible for studies into this vaccine. Contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#482d2c2629662527273a2d08252d2c3e2d3c2e273a382d3c3b662b2725) if you're interested. Improved Treatments? [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330401/) examining \"what do we know about canine osteosarcoma treatment\" discussed the potential use of nanoparticles. The chemo drug doxorubicin and siRNA (RNA molecules) encapsulated in liposome-based dextran nanoparticle could help develop novel therapies. These techniques are used in some human cancer therapies, but not yet available to dogs. Preventing Osteosarcoma When it comes to preventing any kind of cancer, the rules are similar: Feed the very best diet you can afford. This should preferably be a [whole food, raw meat-based diet.](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/raw-feeding-primer/) Use organic, grass-fed meats if you can. Above all, don't feed any kibble or starchy foods. Starch is sugar ... and sugar feeds cancer. Minimize vaccines. The number of conventional vets who still vaccinate dogs with cancer is shocking. Dr Judy Jasek told me she has many patients who come to her recently vaccinated - even after a cancer diagnosis! If your dog isn't healthy, don't let your vet give him any vaccines. [Vaccination](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/what-every-vet-should-know-about-vaccines/) disrupts the immune system, causes chronic disease, and hurts your dog's ability to fight cancer. Apparently many vets aren't reading the vaccine labeling, which says vaccines should only be given to healthy animals. Maintain good gut health. More than 80% of your dog's immune system is in his gut. So promoting good gut health is vital in his ability to resist cancer (or any other disease). As well as a good diet, give [pre and probiotics](https://thenaturaldogstore.com/collections/prebiotics-and-probiotics) to support gut health. Minimize all pharmaceuticals. Try to avoid drugs and pharmaceutical flea and tick products for your dog. Especially [antibiotics](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/three-things-every-dog-owner-should-know-about-antibiotics/), which disrupt the gut microbiome, possibly forever. Conventional drugs suppress disease and drive it deeper. When it comes back, it often comes back in a worse form ... and that could be cancer! Minimize toxins. Keep toxic chemicals out of your dog's environment. This includes [cleaning products](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/cleaning-supplies-killing-your-dog-pet-safe-cleaners/) and [artificial fragrances](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/artificial-fragrances-poisonous-for-dogs/) in your home, fertilizers and pesticides in your yard. Don't spay or neuter your dog. As explained earlier, the risk of osteosarcoma greatly increases in [spayed or neutered](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/three-reasons-to-reconsider-spayneuter/) vs intact dogs. Give your dog filtered or spring water. [Fluoride](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/fluoride-dog-water/) in his water can increase the risk of bone cancers like osteosarcoma. Exercise and fun! Make sure your dog gets to be a dog. Get him outside and moving. It's not just about exercise. Different activities relax body and mind ... and help relieve stress (for you too!). So ... as you contemplate different options for your dog ... keep in mind that toxic treatments may not be the best choices. Alternative treatments can help manage the cancer by supporting your dog's own immune and healing mechanisms. This can prolong your dog's quality of life ... as long as the tumor's not growing. As Dr Goldstein says ... \"I've had pets run around for years ... with some portion of their tumors intact. As long as we've contained the tumor, reduced or eliminated any pain, and enabled the pet to lead a happy, energetic life, who cares if he has a tumor or not? {...] if it remains dormant, it need not arouse our concern or provoke an all-out assault with surgery, "}
