The course will also consider the extent to which overseas invest-ment in less developed countries and the strengthening of regional customs unions and the WTO will affect immigration trends. Due to the gap in the quality of life in developed versus less developed countries as well as the ongoing demand for cheap, unskilled labor, the number of immigrants to the developed world continues to grow in the United States and in the European Union. This Course also invites learners to assess how the growing de- mographic of immigrants and their children may affect voting patterns, public education, and the foreign policy priorities of the devel- oped societies where they tend to settle. 3 Semester Hours gloBAl DeVeloPMent AnD PeAce 533 Cultural Dimensions of Globalization While recognizing that a developing con- sensus exists on economic globalization, this course explores the broader cultural and phil-osophical implications of globalization. Ex- tending beyond economic globalization to the social, political and cultural dimensions, one must indeed explore the substance of what is being \"globalized\" in each of these aspects of public life. This course invites learners to grapple with the question of whether or not the world is ready to implement an expanded globalization or whether a \"dialogue among civilizations\" is a necessary intermediary step in the process. 3 Semester Hours gloBAl DeVeloPMent AnD PeAce 537 Global Communication and Mass Media This course examines media's role in global communication and nation building.
