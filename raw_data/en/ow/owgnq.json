During these sessions, you will meet on Zoom for 15 minutes every weekday at 12 noon ET. The calls begin with a five minute leading thought, followed by space to practice the month's exercise for \"just 5 minutes a day\" with everyone's cameras turned off. There is one to two minutes for journaling and then the call ends with an inspirational thought. It is a good way to build rhythm and consciousness into one's weekday practice & research. The calls are open and friendly. Anyone is welcome to drop in once or as often as is supportive of their practice. If you are not taking part in the Applied Anthroposophy course but would like to join these free, open calls please [email us](mailto:emerge@appliedanthroposophy.org?subject=6BE) for more information. BACKGROUND Rudolf Steiner suggested that certain complementary exercises should accompany all meditational practices as a measure of protection against possible negative influences. These six exercises, meant to foster positive soul qualities, are: 1) Practice self-control over one's thinking. For example: for a period of time -at least five minutes- contemplate any object and concentrate one's thoughts exclusively on this object. (A pencil or a paper clip might do.) 2) Exercise willpower by choosing any free deed, i.e. one that nothing is influencing you to do, and choose a regular time of day or day of the week to practice this. (E.g. water plants at the same time each day.) 3) Practice equanimity: foster calm emotional responses. 4) Try to see positive aspects in everything and to make the best out of every situation. 5) Practice being open to new experiences and ideas, never letting expectations based upon the past close your mind to the lessons of the moment. 6) Find a harmonious, balanced relationship between the above five qualities, practicing each regularly and becoming able to move dynamically between them. The initial three exercises are intended to enable a person to attain self-discipline in [thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking), [willing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_(philosophy)) and [feeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling). The second group of three involve cultivating attitudes toward the world. If you are new to these exercises or need a brief refresher, this 12 minute video presented by Brian Gray of WiseCosmos is an excellent summary: [https://vimeo.com/308654968](https://vimeo.com/308654968) Why we journal: We acknowledge that as students on the path of self-development, we can consider ourselves as spiritual researchers. Our daily practice and our own biographies become research when we are conscious of what we are working towards and the daily steps we take to our goals. When we write notes in our journals we bring focused will to our practice. Co-creating the space: Our intention is that this group experiences co-creating the practice vessel, with each other and the spiritual world. We all need each other to show up in order for the vessel to be real and evolving. All participants are invited to bring in a leading or closing thought. Just email Angela if you have something to share and we will create the time for that to happen. Short & Sweet: By keeping the entire call to only 15 minutes, we hope to make it accessible to everyone in the middle of daily life. Bringing leading thoughts that are limited to 5 minutes, allows us to hone \"what is essential\" and trust that valuable lessons can be revealed through time + rhythm. Join in daily or as your schedule allows.
