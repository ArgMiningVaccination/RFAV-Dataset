Birds are the natural host and reservoir of WNV. Although other animals are susceptible to WNV infection, only birds develop a high enough virus load to transmit the infection to an uninfected... [ Can hunters get West Nile Virus from eating infected game birds? ](/faqs/can-hunters-get-west-nile-virus-eating-infected-game-birds) Some game birds have tested positive for West Nile Virus (WNV). However, there is no evidence of human infection by consumption of properly cooked infected game. Hunters are likely at higher risk of infection by mosquito exposure, particularly in wetland environments. Protective measures should be taken to prevent mosquito exposure while hunting. There are extremely rare cases of laboratory... [ Can my dog or cat get West Nile Virus by eating an infected animal? ](/faqs/can-my-dog-or-cat-get-west-nile-virus-eating-infected-animal) Experimentally, it was found that this might be possible. However, there has been no evidence to indicate that West Nile Virus can be naturally transmitted to cats or dogs that carry or consume infected animals. Dogs and cats can be infected with West Nile Virus through the bite of a mosquito, so minimizing their exposure to mosquitoes is recommended. [ How do I handle a sick or dead animal that might have West Nile Virus? ](/faqs/how-do-i-handle-a-sick-or-dead-animal-might-have-west-nile-virus) Under normal conditions, humans are unlikely to be infected with West Nile Virus by handling a sick or dead animal. However, there are a number of other infections that could potentially result from handling an animal. To protect yourself from exposure to any illness, you should wear gloves or put a plastic bag over your hand before touching the animal and you should wash your hands with soap and... [ How do I know if an animal is infected with West Nile Virus? ](/faqs/how-do-i-know-if-animal-infected-west-nile-virus) Signs of infection in wildlife, like in humans, can range from no symptoms to severe symptoms of neurologic illness. Commonly reported signs in animals include weakness, stumbling, trembling, head tremors, inability to fly/walk, and a lack of awareness that allows them to be easily approached and handled. These symptoms, however, can also have other causes. The only way to positively confirm West...

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with several organizations and laboratories, is developing and testing vaccines for use in birds. Many zoos and wildlife centers have been using the Fort Dodge horse vaccine (West Nile-Innovator\u00ae) in birds. The vaccine has not been tested for use in birds... [ What is the threat from West Nile Virus (WNV) to endangered and threatened bird species? ](/faqs/what-threat-west-nile-virus-wnv-endangered-and-threatened-bird-species) This is an issue of great concern, as these populations are already struggling to survive in the current environment. If some of these species are more vulnerable to fatal WNV infection, WNV may ultimately lead to their extinction or significantly set back the progress of the recovery programs.

All mammals produce normal prions that are used by cells, then degraded and eliminated, or recycled, within the body. When disease-associated prions contact normal prions, they cause them to refold into their own abnormal shape. These disease-associated prions are not readily broken down and tend to accumulate in--and damage-...
