Here are some tips to help get back on track with your pre-holiday health goals: 1. Accept that what you did last month, last week, or yesterday is done. There's no going back, so set your sights on what you can do moving forward. 3. Get more sleep - Wind down your day earlier so you have at least one hour before bedtime to relax. 4. Start moving again - Give yourself time to return to your pre-holiday exercise levels to avoid injury. Build up to getting at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days. 2. Return to a healthy eating routine. Start by eating more meals at home where you can control ingredients. Re-stock with healthy choices including vegetables, fresh fruit, whole grains, and lean proteins. 5. Track it - Keep a log for a few weeks. Include your exercise, sleep habits, and number of meals you eat at home. 2018 Reader Questionnaire Results By Susan Wentzell Managing Editor, Veterans Health Matters 94%rated the magazine as excellent or good 40% 33% became better received informed on valuable healthy living in information to general help manage their health We would like to thank the 376 Veterans and others who replied to our Readership Questionnaire about Veterans Health Matters and the Healthy Living Calendar in the Summer 2018 issue of this magazine. You told us what you think, and you let us know what articles you want to see in the future. Also, you gave us information about how you want to receive the magazine, which is currently distributed in VA medical centers and clinics in Florida, S. Georgia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The good news? Your answers support our main goal of providing information to help Veterans become more informed about healthy living and better management of your health. Key Results Veterans Health Matters was rated very highly (Excellent or Good) by 94% and 73% said the same for the Healthy Living Calendar. 91% of you said they read all or most of the magazine's articles. Many of you told us you made a positive behavior change because of information you read. Most prefer getting the magazine at home vs. other delivery methods. We started ofering that option in the Spring 2017 issue and since then, more than 1,300 Veterans have signed up for home delivery. You can too - see page 7. Your Suggestions We learned you want more articles on whole health, weight loss, nutrition (herbs and organic foods), exercises for those over age 65, sleep issues, caregiving, and cancer. You also want to hear from Veterans who have successfully overcome obstacles like alcoholism, smoking, and eating disorders. Veteran testimonials can be very powerful! You want more healthy recipes in Veterans Health Matters, along with women's health articles, more original photos, and more \"fun\" stuf, like word jumbles. However, there are clearly some areas we still need to work on, such as letting you know how you can receive the Healthy Living Calendar. VISN 8 and the Veterans Health Matters Editorial Board will use all your answers to improve the magazine and calendar to better serve you. Our common goal is to continue to provide our Veterans with the most useful, up-to-date health information possible. Thank you for your continued support! WINTER \u00bb 2018 | 3 Women Take Heart Battling Heart Disease & Stroke February is American Heart Month. VA's Women's Health Services is joining this national movement with the American Heart Association and their Go Red for Women campaign to raise awareness about heart disease and stroke among women Veterans. Do you know that the symptoms for a heart attack can be diferent in women compared to men, or that women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke? One in three women die from heart and blood vessel diseases, killing one woman every minute. What is CVD? Heart and blood vessel diseases are known as cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many heart-related problems are caused by a buildup of plaque in arteries, making it harder for blood to fow through. If a blood clot forms, blood fow can stop and cause a heart attack if blood vessels go to the heart. Or, a clot can cause a stroke if blood vessels go to the brain. A stroke can also be caused by sudden bleeding in the brain. SYMPTOMS OF HEART DISEASE Some women have no symptoms until they have a heart attack, while others may experience: Angina (dull/heavy to sharp chest pain) Pain in neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen, or back Fluttering feelings in the chest Shortness of breath, fatigue, or swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, and abdomen Call 911 if you have any of these symptoms or get immediate medical care. TREATMENT SYMPTOMS OF STROKE Face drooping - One side droops or is numb, especially when the person smiles. Arm weakness - One arm drifts downward when the person raises their arms. Speech difculty - Speech is slurred, or a person is unable to speak, or hard to understand. Call 911 if you have any of these symptoms, even if they go away. Watch the Video! You can view the video version of \"Women Take Heart - Battling Heart Disease & Stroke\" at www. visn8.va.gov/VISN8/news / publications.asp. For both heart disease and stroke, the main goals are to stop further damage, help prevent a future heart attack or stroke, and restore body function as much as possible. This may include medications and surgery to open or bypass blocked arteries, and controlling or reducing risk factors. Rehabilitation programs help reduce risk for future problems, and help restore balance, speech, and movement for patients recovering from a stroke. 4 | Veterans Health Matters \u00bb www.visn8.va.gov Heart Attack Symptoms in Women Call 911 if you experience these warning signs: Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain in the center of chest that may or may not go away and come back. Although this is the most common symptom in women and men, women are more likely to have some of the following symptoms: Pain or discomfort in the arm(s), back, neck, jaw, or stomach Shortness of breath, with or without chest discomfort Nausea/vomiting, lightheadedness, or breaking out in a cold sweat Extreme fatigue High blood pressure can be silent - and deadly! High blood pressure is the leading cause for stroke and can do signifcant damage to your heart and blood vessels. Often, there are no signs. That's why it's so important to get it checked as your health care provider recommends. Treatment may include medications and making lifestyle changes. Know Your Heart-Health Numbers There are some risk factors for CVD you can't do anything about, such as your age, sex, and family history. Fortunately, approximately 80% of CVD may be prevented with lifestyle changes and education. Knowing your heart-health numbers is a good place to start the conversation about your personal risk with your health care provider. Risk Factor Ideal Numbers for Most Adults Blood cholesterol Talk to your doctor about how your cholesterol numbers afect your overall risk. Blood pressure less than 120/80 (mm HG) Fasting blood sugar less than 100 (mg/dL) Body Mass Index less than 25 (kg/m2 ) Lifestyle Changes to Reduce CVD Risk Factors Maintain a healthy weight or lose weight if overweight. Be physically active on most days. Eat a balanced diet that includes cutting back on foods high in fat and sugar. Quit tobacco, if you use it. Avoid or limit alcohol to one drink a day for women. Learn to manage stress and relax. Manage blood pressure, which may include taking medication as recommended by your doctor. Control blood sugar, especially if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes. See your doctor as recommended for blood pressure and cholesterol monitoring, along with other heart-health issues.
