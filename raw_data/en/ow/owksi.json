We are close to the mountains (and I love to be outdoors), we are close to the beaches in New Jersey and Delaware and the overall viewpoint and lifestyle regarding health, dietary considerations and physical activity levels are in synch with my lifestyle. This is a safe community that offers so very much and the patients I see here in Pike Creek are health conscious making them a joy to work with. WHAT SETS US APART What sets my office apart from others in Pike Creek, Delaware is the approach I take in working with my patients. Each patient in an individual and is treated as such because we believe that everyone enters our office with a different physiology, set of circumstances, etc. In addition, I work with patients by hearing their concerns and matching my knowledge and treatments with what works for them to resolve their health problem. I feel strongly that my role is to uncover the reasons for their pain or condition to the degree that they choose. At times, my patients would like something more direct or straightforward and easy to follow. Other patients prefer more in-depth answers that might require testing. The choice belongs to them. And the average patients that present are seeking more natural care for their overall health as they are worried about the side effects of pharmaceuticals or would prefer to become healthier and not need the medications. I am always willing to adjust their diets if they wish to do so and recommend other lifestyle modifications that will enhance their lives and perhaps reduce their pain, etc. COMMON CONDITIONS WE HELP Some of the common conditions that I see here in Pike Creek, DE are digestive disorders such as leaky gut, GERD and reflux, immune problems or autoimmune conditions, sinus problems or even allergies, lower back pain, neck pain, headaches, disc disorders, sciatica, obesity and the list goes on. They all require a different approach unique to them. Much of the population here in Pike Creek, DE as in other areas, has problems with sleeping as well. "}
