The specific vaccines recommended will depend on factors like your pet's age, lifestyle, and local disease prevalence. Beyond vaccinations, wellness exams offer an opportunity for veterinarians to discuss nutrition, parasite prevention, dental care, behavior, and any concerns or questions you may have. They provide a holistic approach to pet care and enable you to address potential health issues proactively. Remember, preventive care is always better than reactive treatment.
