I was in search for a place where I could receive preventative care for holistic health. The care Dr. Gerep gives is individualized and personalized to my needs. I appreciate the deep research that goes into my care and not a prescribed answer given immediately. She is always taking time to thoroughly find the best solutions for me. - 2/11/2022 I had a video call with them as a new patient yesterday and I had no issues at all. I had been resistant this for a couple of years so I went onto normals site and found this company and expressed my concerns about all this misinformation I was reading they gladly answered all my questions and concerns then set me up with a video call in an hour this went smooth as silk and all my silly concerns vanished so so far I can give this business five stars. - 4/5/2019 It's unfortunate that the only two reviews here are from people that didn't pay attention to the cancellation policy so they lost their deposit. These doctors have been a godsend to me and I recommend them very highly. I struggle with Lyme disease and I am just getting over the flu and a bout of pneumonia and I don't know what I would have done without their care and advice. It's nice to be heard and listened to and feel like you're not just another patient. I am thankful every day for the doctors here. - 4/5/2019 We had a wonderful first experience at Richmond Natural Medicine. Dr Beliy was genuinely concerned about my sons health issues and seemed excited for the challenge to help him on his journey to good health and wellness. She is very knowledgeable, informative and was able to answer all our questions. She also gave extra time to explain the specialized health plan to us. Only five days into following her plan and my son said he feels a considerable good change in his energy. She has given him hope and that is worth everything to a very concerned mom! Looking forward to the next appointment. Thank you! - 6/2/2018 The same this happened to me about the deposit. I had no clue! I had to cancel my appointment because I was sent on a business trip and then was transferred. They told me that their was no expiration on the deposit. Let's see!! - 1/22/2018First to Review During my time at RNM, I worked with two doctors. One was spectacular and the other had little to no bedside manner. Unfortunately, the doctor that I met with for a year is no longer working there and she was the only doctor of color in the entire office. The office now has no one that can meet the needs of those of color who want to address issues of health that are understood under that premise. It is unfortunate because the doctor, was AMAZING. She changed my life and the life of those I recommended to her. Dr. Allen, not to be confused with the new doc with a similar last name, was approachable, understanding, and knew fertility conditions for women of color better than most. I am no longer going to RNM because she is not there. I paid well over 2 thousand dollars in less than a year to make sure that I was looked after properly and now that Dr. M. Allen is not there, I will not be there. The office seems to have an issue with people of color and will not maintain doctors of that nature. I question the overall outlook of what is happening since the prices have increases as well.
