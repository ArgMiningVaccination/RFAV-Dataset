As a result, they said, \"[m]illions of people were prevented from entering restaurants, bars, gyms, theaters, sports arenas, and other public indoor areas without proof of COVID-19 vaccination,\" with people and businesses facing \"large disruptions.\" [NOVAK DJOKOVIC ASKS PERMISSION TO ENTER US FOR TOURNAMENTS DUE TO VACCINE STATUS: 'NOT IN MY HANDS'](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/novak-djokovic-asks-permission-enter-us-tournaments-vaccine-status-not-my-hands) [In New York City,](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city) 1,430 city employees were terminated for not following the mandate, and most restaurants lost customers and staff. \"Most supporters of the mandates claim that the associated increase in vaccination rates, and its implied reduction in the spread of COVID-19, outweigh the cost of the disruptions. However, we find that the effects of the mandates on their intended outcomes are not statistically noticeable in any of the cities they were implemented in all empirical strategies used,\" they said.

Unlike country-wide mandates imposed in Europe, people can get by unvaccinated in cities with mandates by simply traveling to a neighboring city. \"COVID cases were not affected by the mandate, COVID deaths were not affected by it, and people were not more likely to get vaccinated at all in the first place,\" Melo said, according to Fox5DC.

The authors also pointed out that by the time the studied cities implemented their mandates, a significant percentage of their populations had already been vaccinated. \"The idea behind the mandate is more people are gonna get vaccinated, therefore we're gonna reduce the spread of COVID,\" Melo said.
