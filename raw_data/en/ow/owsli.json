Indeed, the market for organic and natural cosmetic preservatives is expected to grow at a significant pace in the European and North American markets. RM points to frequent regulatory actions prohibiting or limiting the use of given ingredients as an additional driver for natural preservative demand. High Costs of Naturals However, the high costs of organic and natural cosmetic preservatives are a significant challenge, according to RM. \"Costs of preservatives increased post the pandemic due to the shortages in the supply of high-quality products. Though there is high demand for natural and organic cosmetic preservatives, the high costs of preservatives pose a challenge for cosmetic manufacturers.\" Cosmeceutical, Sunscreen and Male Cosmetic Drivers Beyond naturals, additional drivers for cosmetic preservative growth, per Vantage, include the increased use of cosmeceuticals; specifically multifunctionals such as color-correcting creams and beauty balms. Also, the firm projects the sunscreen and scrubs category will account for more than 30% of total sales by 2028. \"This application category is expected to develop as people become more aware of the damage that ultraviolet rays do to the skin.\" Lastly, the firm sees growth in the hair care market as another driver. RM sees additional opportunity in male-specific cosmetics ranging from moisturizers and anti-aging products to mud masks. \"Numerous problems are faced by younger males in general related to oily skin, acne, hair fall and wrinkles,\" the firm explained. \"All these problems can be overcome with awareness about and the use of the proper cosmetics\"\u2014and all, of course, require proper product preservation.
