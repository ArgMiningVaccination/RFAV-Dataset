[CRV-101](https://curevovaccine.com/programs/) strategy contrasts with traditional approaches using live-killed or attenuated viruses. Sub-unit vaccines do not contain virus components and cannot cause infection addition, The adjuvant component was specifically engineered to produce an optional immune response while using a smaller amount of adjuvant with a targeted structure-function approach. CRV-101 was [specifically](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221116005081/en/Curevo-Vaccine-Announces-26-Million-Series-A1-Financing-to-Support-Clinical-Development-of-Next-Generation-Subunit-Vaccines) designed to produce an optimal immune response while using a smaller amount of adjuvant with the intention of achieving similar efficacy but with fewer side effects than the currently-approved shingles vaccine. CRV-101 enjoys a highly scalable, straightforward [manufacturing profile](https://curevovaccine.com/programs/) explicitly designed to eliminate the potential for supply disruptions. In the Phase 1 program, CRV-101 demonstrated robust immunogenicity as measured by humoral and cellular responses with no grade 3 injection site reactions and a low (1.3%) rate of grade 3 systemic side effects. Curevo is a Bothell, WA-based clinical-stage company with partners in South Korea's Mogam Institute for Biomedical Research and GC Pharma. The Series A round was led by RA Capital Management. Other investors include Adjuvant Capital, Janus Henderson Investors, EN Investment, and founding investor GC Pharma.

CRV-101 Vaccine Indication Once children are infected with chickenpox, the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) remains in the [U.S. CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/varicella-chickenpox#:~:text=Varicella%2Dzoster%20virus%20(VZV),causing%20herpes%20zoster%20(shingles).). VZV typically remains inactive to cause shingles with age-related immunosenescence. The CRV-101 vaccine candidate is currently indicated to prevent shingles in adults 50 and older. CRV-101 Vaccine Side Effects The CRV-101 Phase 1 study included 90 subjects, with solicited reactogenicity adverse events consisting of no grade 3 local injection site events and only one grade 3 systemic event (fever) in the highest dose group. According to the U.S. CDC [website](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html), about 16% receiving Shingrix\u00ae experienced side effects preventing them from participating in regular activities. CRV-101 Vaccine Dosage A [Phase 1](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03820414), Group 1 Subjects receive two doses of the candidate CRV-101 formulation 1, administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm, according to a 0, 2 Month schedule. Group 2 Subjects receive two doses of the candidate CRV-101 formulation 2, administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm, according to a 0, 2 Month schedule. Furthermore, Groups 3 and 4 received increasing doses.

CRV-101 Clinical Trial The [phase two](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05304351) study - enrolled 678 participants across eleven U.S. sites, randomized to a high- or low-dose CRV-101 arm or Shingrix. Participants received two doses, two months apart, as per current practice for a shingles vaccine. Eligibility criteria included adults over 50 with no prior varicella zoster virus vaccination or history of shingles. They were broadly representative of the potential non-immunosuppressed patient population for a shingles vaccine. The primary endpoints focus on safety and immunologic outcomes, including the occurrence of local and systemic side effects, antibody levels at month three, comparison of the reactogenicity of CRV-101 to Shingrix, and the occurrence of serious adverse events. Patient enrollment started in February 2022, and topline data from this Phase 2b trial are expected in January 2023. Clinical Trial [NCT03820414:](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03820414) Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of CRV-101 in Healthy Adult Subjects. A Phase 1b clinical trial will be conducted at the Family Center for Research with Ubuntu at Tygerberg Academic Hospital, a research center within Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa, in Q4 2021. Phase 1b study objectives include evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of two intramuscular vaccinations approximately two months apart in HIV-infected children. In the Phase 1 trial, CRV-101 [demonstrated](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220210005295/en/Curevo-Vaccine-Announces-60-Million-Series-A-Financing-to-Support-Clinical-Development-of-Next-Generation-Subunit-Vaccines) very robust immunogenicity as measured by humoral and cellular responses with no grade 3 injection site side effects and a 1.3% rate of grade 3 systemic side effects (\"grade 3\" side effects are those vaccination-related reactions severe enough to prevent normal activities).
