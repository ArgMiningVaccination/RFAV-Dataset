Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 6Summary of the DUR Board 7Drug Use Review Board The Drug Use Review Board (DUR) is a requirement of the Social Security Act, Section 1927 and operates in accordance with Nevada Medicaid Services Manual , Chapter 1200 - Prescribed Drugs and Nevada Medicaid Opera tions Manual Chapter 200. The DUR Board consists of no less than five members and no more than ten members appointed by the State Director of Health and Human Resources. Members mu st be licensed t o practice in the State of Nevada and either an actively practicing physician or an actively practicing pharmacist. The DUR Board meets quarterly to monitor drugs for: therapeutic appropriateness, over or under-utilization, therapeutic duplications, drug-disease contraindications quality care The DUR Board does this by establishing prior authorization and quantity limits to certain drugs/drug classes based on u tilization data, experience, and t estimony presented at the DUR Board meetings. This includes re trospective evaluation of inter ventions, and prospective drug review that is done electronical ly for each prescription filled at the Point of Sale (POS). Meetings are held quarterly and are open to the public. Anyone wishing to address the DUR Board may do so. Public comment is limited to five minutes per speaker/organization (due to time constraints). Anyone presen ting documents for consideratio n must provide sufficient copies for each board member and a copy (electronic preferred) for the official record. The mission of the Nevada DUR Boa rd is to work with the agency to improve medication utilization in patients covered by Medicaid. The primary goal o f drug utilization review is to enhance and improve the quality of pharmaceutical care and pati ent outcomes by encouraging optimal drug use.

Motion and second to approve the minutes as submitted. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. b. Status Update by DHCFP Holly Long: I'm Holly Long with DHCFP. In recognition of the Interna tional overdose Awareness day, Governor Steve Sisolak proclaime d Saturday August 31 as Overdos e Awareness Day for Nevada. Also, I wanted to provide some statisti cal information regarding the impact of Assembly Bill 474. There was a report that was created by the Board of Pharmacy if all of yo u will remember. Assembly Bill 474 was from the 2017 Legislative Session, that required specific infor mation on controlled substance prescriptions like patient date of birth, ICD-10 codes, DEA numbers and so-forth. It also required reporting of drug overdoses by healthcare providers and require d providers to check the controlled substance history within the PMP or the prescription monitoring program. Requirements from writing an initial prescription such as patient risk assessment and inf ormed consent. Prescriptions written for treating pain for more than 30 days, for more than 90 days and also for exceeding 365 days in a rolling period. Since the implementation of these requirements which we re mandated by January 1, 2018, we have been trying to monitor and watch what the effects have bee n. The Board of Pharmacy put together a good statistical analysis on this. These numbers have been pr ovided in other public forums as well. This is not specific to Medicai d, but Nevada as a whole. In comparing the prescription rates from 2016 to 2018, there has been a 52% decr ease statewide in the number of opioid prescription rates. The total number of potential doctor shoppers decreased from 2013 to 2018 by 96%. There was an increase in PMP queries from year to year starting with 2014 to 2018 rangin g from 29% to 51%. The opioid prescriptions with less than a 30-day supply decreased by 53%. Opioid prescription with greater than or equal to a 30-day supply but still less than a 90-day supply de creased by 24%. Opioid prescriptions with greater than or equal to 90-day supply decreased by 50%. The number of individuals co-prescribed an opioid and benzo during the same month also decreased significantly which was 54%. By county, all Nevada Counties demonstrated a d ecrease in both the number and in rate of opiate prescriptions by month ranging from 25% such as Lincoln County up to 56% in Humboldt County. The number of opiate deaths from 2010 to 2018 has started to decrease. I also wanted to provide a DHCFP policy update. The DUR edits that were required from Senate Bill 378 from the rece nt 2019 Legislative Session were implemented on October 1, 2019. Some edits we already had in pl ace, but any that were not in place have been implemente d. I have a list of those edits if anyone n eeds them. 4. Clinical Presentations a.For Possible Action: Discussion and possible adoption of prior authorization criter ia and/or quantity limits for Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec- xioi). Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 13November 20, 2019 Page 4 Paul Oesterman, Chair: Our first topic is the discussion and po ssible adoption of prior authorization criteria and/or quantity limits for Zolgensma. Is there any pub lic comment? Jeremy Short, Region Medical Director with Avexis: Zolgensma is the first and only gene replacement therapy that has been approved to treat spinal musc ular atrophy in pediatric under the age of two. It is given as one-time intravenous dose over 60 mi nutes. It is the only therapy thus far that targets the root cause of SMA which is caused by mutations in the SM1 gene. SMA has an incidence of 1 in 10,000 live births and is characterized by th e rapid degradation of the function of the lower motor neurons or spinal motor neurons which leads to progressive muscle weakness. In natural history, Type 1 SMA, w e see that over 90% of those pati ents would not survive to the age of two without intensive therapy. We did have some comments on the proposed prior authorization guidelines. There is language in number two a and b that define d the appropriate patient population. Under 2a, it is talking about the symptomatic patie nt population and is specifically calls out patients with the diagnosis of SMA type one or two and less than two years of age. This is largely consistent with our label. The only comment we would make is in regards to the specific calling out type one and two patients. There is expert consensu s that are covered in the review about treating individuals with three copies of the backup gene SMA 2. You could theoretically have a patient who is an early onset type three patient who has symptom onset between one and half and two years of age and the expert consensus would guide us to say that patient should be treated with three copies. You could potentially miss that pati ent with how it is worded now. Our suggestion would be to just drop the specific wording of type one and two and leave it more to the label to treat a patient with SMA regardless of time. The secon d part under two B, it is talking about the pre-symptomatic population. It looks good talking abo ut three copies or less of SMN two. The one thing we would mention is the stipulation is the p atient be less than or equal to six months of age who is pre-symptomatic. Naturall y you are going to catch these patients pretty early on most of the time if they are being diagnosis with newborn sc reening. On the off-chance you had a patient that did not present with symptoms until seven mo nths of age, maybe they had three copies of SMA two, expert consensus guides that you would want to treat that patient. We know that the outcomes are betting the earlier treatment is initiated. The best chance of efficacy would be to treat prior to symptom onset. You would not want to force a patient to undergo irreversible motor neuron loss just in order to show symptoms to be a candidate for treatment. I guess we would recommend alter the age limit to be in line and consisten t with two A that is talking about less than two years of age rather than six months. One of the c ommon questions we get is durability with this being a new therapy. Our completed phase one study with 15 patients with SMA type one. All of those were on the proposed therapeutic dose and the y had the option to enroll in long term follow up study. I am happy to address any questions. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Our binders have the new format with the Optum recommendations and separate acceptance or addition al recommendations from our mana ged care organizations. Carl Jeffery: This is a novel gene therapy. It is a one-time d ose for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. If this is being billed through a physician's office, any PA criteria we add today will not apply. Our proposed criteria mirrors what is on our commercial criteria. Dave England: How is this diagnosed? In the hospital? Jeremy Short, Region Medical Director with Avexis: If you have new born screening, which this is not included in Nevada, that would be one way. Family histo ry but usually with symptom onset. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 14November 20, 2019 Page 5 Then they go through the pathway to see a specialist for diagno sis. Unfortunately, when that happens, they suffer irreversible motor neuron damage. With any other currently available disease modifying therapies your best case for halting disease progress ion is to implement treatment as early as possible. This could be administered in t he physician's office. The clinical trials, the patients were kept inpatient, but there is no indication that n eeds to be done. Carl Jeffery: The Optum criteria follows to label. We just want to make sure the appropriate people are getting this treatment. Lisa Todd : I don't have anything to add. Ryan Bitton: Neither does HPN. Tom Beranek: I added a couple things, but I am ok with consensu s. Paul Oesterman, Chair: The question is on two A and two B, bull et point one, removing the specificity of type one or two. On B, changing the age from six month to less than two years of age. I would had for a patient not be able to receive treatment because they are six months and one day. The two years makes sense to be consistent. In terms of symptomatic type one or two. If we list those, we might have to come back in a short amount of time to redo the criteria. My proposal would be to accept the prior authorization guidelines with thos e two changes. The elimination of type one or type two in A one and c hanging the age limit on B t hree to two years. Motion and second to accept revised criteria. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. b.For Possible Action: Discussion and possible adoption of updated prior authorizatio n criteria and/or quantity limits for narcolepsy agents. Paul Oesterman, Chair: We have the discussion and possible adoption of updated prior authorization criteria and/or quantity limits for narcolepsy ag ents. Do we have any public comment? Carl Jeffery: There is a new medication, Sunosi. It is indicate d for the treatment of narcolepsy and sleep disorder related to obstructive sleep apnea. Similar to o ur current criteria for Provigil and Nuvigil and criteria for Xyrem, we wanted to make sure the class is whole. The criteria is similar. The member has a diagnosis of narcolepsy confirmed by a sleep s tudy, try and failure of Provigil and Nuvigil. For reauthorization, documentation of a positive c linical response. For obstructive sleep apnea, a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea defined by 15 or more obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep confirmed b y a sleep study or five or more obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep confirmed by a sleep study and one of the listed symptoms. Reauthorization criteria is straightforward w ith documented positive clinical r esponse. Lisa Todd : I don't have anything to add. Ryan Bitton: Nothing to add. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 15November 20, 2019 Page 6 Tom Beranek: Do we have an age of 18 or older? Jim Marx : How do they define obstructive sleep apnea? I'm not sure wha t an event is. Carl Jeffery : I'm not familiar with the diagnosis process. Jim Marx: It would be nice to clean up the language. I think it is too vague. Paul Oesterman, Chair: How does the rest of the group feel about the 18 years old? I have never seen narcolepsy in pediatrics. Netochi Adeolokun: The approval length, is that based on the studies? Carl Jeffery : I'm not sure. Paul Oesterman, Chair: I think they should both be the same. Dave England: Does it ever get better? I can see six-month appr oval to see if things are getting better. Checking for effectiveness or no further progression. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Are we getting any requests for this cur rently? Carl Jeffery: Nothing yet. The utilization numbers are in the b inder. Through June, there were not any claims. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Do we want to table this and bring it back next time with more information on obstructive sleep apnea and na rcolepsy? And also clarify the approval length of six or 12 months. Jim Marx: I think what the effect of that will be is that it wi ll require the patient actually have a sleep study rather than someone saying they saw it happen three times. Dave England: I would think you would want to do the sleep stud ies before you prescribe this as opposed to having trouble sleeping. Carl Jeffery: The criteria does state they have 15 or more obst ructive events per hour of sleep confirmed by a sleep study unless the prescriber provides justi fication confirming a sleep study would not be feasible. That is listed in one A and one B. Paul Oesterman, Chair: This will be tabled to the next meeting. c.For Possible Action: Discussion and possible adoption of updated prior authorization criteria and/or quantity limi ts for hematopoietic/hematinic age nts Paul Oesterman, Chair: Our next topic is the discussion and pos sible adoption of updated prior authorization criteria and/or quantity limits for hematopoietic/hematinic agents. Do we have any public comment? Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 16November 20, 2019 Page 7 Carl Jeffery: We are going through our old criteria that has no t been reviewed for a long time and bringing it to the board for review. The binder has Chapter 1200 criteria. On page 61, I did suggest one minor change that the recipient has been evaluated for adeq uate iron stores. The rest of the criteria is the same. Paul Oesterman, Chair: One question I have, many patients are e nd-stage renal disease, which is covered by Medicare? Carl Jeffery: This is included in the Medicare daily rate, so there should not be any dialysis patients receiving this through Fee-for-service. The utilization shows on page 62, there is a spike related to one pharmacy that is misidentified in the system and that will be corrected. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Has the P&T reviewed this? Carl Jeffery: Yes, we just reviewed this at the last meeting. Paul Oesterman, Chair: The only amendment is the evaluation of iron stores? Jim Marx: All these agents increase fibrinogen which increase t he incidence of DVT. I wonder if we should have an educational component in the criteria? Carl Jeffery: That is a black-box warning. We always walk the l ine of what is the responsibility of the DUR Board. This is enforced by the FDA. The call center su ggested, under two B, if it is for pre-operative use, should that be included. And they asked if t he exclusion could be cleaned up to make it more clear. But I think that is something we could clea n up later. Holly Long: Is it necessary to have the non-covered indications ? Carl Jeffery: I think it is good to have that. Some are medically indicated, but they are covered through other means. Paul Oesterman, Chair: What do the managed care organizations have to say? Lisa Todd : I don't have anything to add. Ryan Bitton : I think the criteria works. We use hematocrit instead of hemo globin, but I don't thin k that makes a big difference. Our criteria doesn't call out othe r indications like hepatitis C and non - dysplastic disease. For anemia due to chemotherapy, there is a two-month limit. Jim Tran: One thing the guideline goes up to 11, which can increase cardiovascular death. I wonder if we could adjust the range. Paul Oesterman, Chair: I know a lot of places with the protocol s, it is given once per week. If the hemoglobin increases greater tha n one gram, they do a 25% reduc tion in the dose the following week. I don't know how that would be incorporated or if this wi ll be a standard dose. Carl Jeffery : We don't PA the specific dose, we don't get down to that leve l. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 17November 20, 2019 Page 8 Paul Oesterman, Chair: Jim, would you make the recommendation t hen under criteria number two to maintain hemoglobin levels up to 11? Jim Tran: Yes, up to 11. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Any other recommendations to modificatio ns? We will call for a motion to approve the criteria as presented with an update for the inclusion of adequate iron stores and modifying the hemoglobin levels to up to 11 grams per deciliter. Motion and second to accept amended proposed criteria. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. d.For Possible Action: Discussion and possible adoption of updated prior authorizatio n criteria and/or quantity limits for Regranex (becaplermin) Paul Oesterman, Chair: Our next topic is the discussion and pos sible adoption of updated prior authorization criteria and/or quantity limits for Regranex. Do we have public comment? Carl Jeffery: This is another criteria where we wanted the boar d to review. On page 82, I have one recommended change that includes treatment in combination with ulcer would care to prevent infection. Paul Oesterman, Chair : Do the MCO's have an y input? Lisa Todd: We talk about the diagnosis, we have a note included that the ulcer is stage three or four in the international association for interstomal therapy g uide to chronic staging. That was the only difference. Ryan Bitton: Nothing from HPN. Tom Beranek: The only thing that we had suggested adding was a dose limit of one tube. Paul Oesterman, Chair: I think it is possible to incorporate that. I agree the limitation should be foe stage three and four chronic sores. Jim Marx: What about large ulcers, is one tube enough? Tom Beranek: In the majority of cases, you only need one tube. In the rare case you need more, you could get an override. Paul Oesterman, Chair: This one is five-month approval, differe nt than others. Lisa Todd: I think that is due to the length of therapy. Carl Jeffery: This is part of wound care, if they are not getti ng better after five months, they need to reassess therapy. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 18November 20, 2019 Page 9 Jim Tran: The guidelines state after 20 weeks if no healing, th e treatment should be reassessed. Carl Jeffery: From a Fee-for- service side, we don't see very much utilization. Some months d on't see any claims, some months thre e claims. We may consider if we need criteria at all. Paul Oesterman, Chair : Let's take away the prior authorization and add a quantity limit. The quantity limit of 1 tube. Carl Jeffery : If we just have a quantity limit, we don't need to have it in Chapter 1200. Then it doesn't need to be maintained by the DUR Board. Motion to remove the prior aut horization criteria. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. e.For Possible Action: Discussion and possible adoption of updated prior authorizatio n criteria and/or quantity limits for topical, local anesthetics. Paul Oesterman, Chair: The next topic is the discussion and pos sible adoption of updated prior authorization criteria and/or quantity limits for topical, loca l anesthetics. Do we have any public comment? Carl Jeffery: This is one more we are bringing to the board. T here are several new products like ZTLido. They add another product to make them a little differen t. Jim Marx: I can tell you the ZTLido works much better than the Lidoderm. Patients find them much more effective. Carl Jeffery: These are only indicated for postherpetic neuralg ia. Jim Marx : It is effective for many other conditions. I don't think ther e is adequate literature to support, like muscular-skeletal pain. Carl Jeffery: Right now, the criteria is limited to Lidocaine patch specifically. I think we want to include other products. Utilizatio n is on page 93, we do have a significant amount of claims. Lidocaine patches are non-preferred, but we still see a lot of use. Paul Oesterman, Chair: I know there are some products available now over the counter with these ingredients. Should these all be incorporated into this class r ather than one for 5% patches? Holly Long: The over the counter is a little different since th ey require a prior authorization. Carl Jeffery : I don't know what they are indicated for off the top of my he ad. The just need a prescription for coverage. Paul Oesterman, Chair : What do the MCO's have to say? Tom Beranek: I am good with the recommendation from Optum. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 19November 20, 2019 Page 10 Ryan Bitton: The criteria that Optum has for post-herpetic neur algia, does that include neuropathy? In our plan we cover for neuropathy after they try a tricyclic, SNRI or gabapentin. We have a path for the Lidocaine patches for neuropathy. Lisa Todd: Ours is just for post-herpetic neuralgia. Paul Oesterman, Chair : We have a difference from what the MCO's have compared to Fee-for- service. Jim Marx: In this era of opioid sparing, we have these non-opioid treatments available that can be effective, I would like to see these more open like where HPN criteria with a neuropathy indication. It would make sense to me to open these up. Dave England: I agree, we have the same issue with getting peop le to reduce their opioid, we try to get people on these patches in place of an oral opioid. They seem effective and happy with them. Paul Oesterman, Chair: I found the same in the hospital patient s. Beth Slamowitz: Does the indication include neuropathy or just post-herpetic neuralgia? Carl Jeffery: As far as I know, it is just post-herpetic neural gia. Beth Slamowitz: We are restricted to cover it only for FDA-appr oved indication, which is post- herpetic neuralgia. Paul Oesterman, Chair: I think we are limited to what we can do with the prior authorization guidelines to post-herpetic neuralgia. I can see two options, w e can approve the criteria as presented or we can remove the prior authorization requirements . Do the managed care organization feel they need to keep the criteria? Ryan Bitton: We recommend keeping the criteria. Lisa Todd: We are the same. Paul Oesterman, Chair : I don't think there are any changes presented here, do we hav e a motion to approve the criteria as presented? Motion and second to approve the criteria as presented. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. f.For Possible Action: Discussion and possible adoption of updated prior authorizatio n criteria and/or quantity limits for inhaled anticholinergic age nts. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Our next item is the discussion and poss ible adoption of updated prior authorization criteria and/or quantity limits for inhaled antic holinergics. Do we have any public comment? Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 20November 20, 2019 Page 11 Carl Jeffery: One more old criteria. The criteria is only one a nticholinergic product be used within a 30 day period. We have some long-acting anticholinergic and I c o u l d s e e u s i n g t h e s e i n combination with a short-acting product for rescue. I think the criteria is outdated. Paul Oesterman, Chair : I'm questioning if we even need prior authorization criteria. Carl Jeffery: Page 109 has the utilization. The Advair Diskus d ecreased with the introduction of some generics. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Do we have data showing that there are p atients using multiple anticholinergic agents at the same time? Carl Jeffery : We shouldn't see that because the PA criteria does not allow multiple products. Ryan Bitton: We are ok with removing criteria. We have the clas s on the preferred drug list. Lisa Todd: We are like HPN. W e have a quantity limit set. Tom Beranek: I don't have anything to add. Paul Oesterman, Chair: These are such widely used medication. D o we need prior authorization? We could manage with a quantity limit? Do we have a motion to r emove the prior authorization criteria and just have a quant ity limit of one unit for 30-day limit? Motion and second to accept the removal of the prior authorizat ion criteria and add a quantity limit of one unit per 30 days. Carl Jeffery: I just want to clarify; the intent is to allow on e long-acting unit and one short-acting unit. I just want to make it clear for the minutes. One of eith er long-acting or one short-acting agent. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. g.For Possible Action: Discussion and possible adoption of updated prior authorizatio n criteria and/or quantity limits for Daliresp (roflumilast) Paul Oesterman, Chair: The next topic is the discussion and pos sible adoption of updated prior authorization criteria and/or quantity limits for Daliresp. Do we have any public comment? Carl Jeffery: This is old criteria. Our utilization on page 135 , about 20 to 25 claims per month. We wanted to evaluate the criteria to make sure it is still necessary. I don 't have any recommended changes. Under D, to remove the severe part so it would just re ad COPD. Lisa Todd: The only thing is that we have some items that it wo uld not be approved for. A diagnosis of moderate Child-Pugh B or severe Child-Pugh C hepatic impairm ent. Also individuals using with concomitant CYP-450 enzyme inducer. Or requesting to trea t acute bronchospasm. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Would the drug interactions be picked up by the filling pharmacy? Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 21November 20, 2019 Page 12 Carl Jeffery : I don't think we have any hard -stops for drug-drug interactions. It would be a soft- stop for the pharmacist to evaluate the interaction. Ryan Bitton: We are ok with the criteria with the addition of v ery severe COPD. Tom Beranek: Our criteria requires it be prescribed with a long -acting bronchodilator and the dose is limited to 500 mcg per day or one tablet. Paul Oesterman, Chair: When will the generic be available? Carl Jeffery : This is not on my radar, I'm not sure. Holly Long: Is there a reason to removed Severe? Carl Jeffery: That was the recommendation from the call center and also remove the term chronic bronchitis of COPD. I think it is because the way the diagnosis is made. Dave England: There has been a generic approved, but it is not on the market yet. Carl Jeffery: They recommend removing the severe language because we require failure of three other medications implies the c ondition is severe. And also rem ove the chronic bronchitis term because it can be used without chronic bronchitis. Mark Canty: There is no diagnosis for severe vs mild or moderat e, so how would we know? It should be for severe, but it is subjective to the provider. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Do we ha ve any information on if patient s stay on this for a long time? Carl Jeffery: I have not looked at the durability. The utilizat ion shows 44 members and it is consistent through the year. Paul Oesterman, Chair: We have the guidelines with recommendation to remove \"Severe\" from D and remove \"Chronic Bronchitis\" from D also. Does anyone feel t he need to include the exclusion criteria that Lisa was talking about? Child-Pugh hepatic impairment and CYP-450 inducers. The indication does say it is not i ndicated for acute treatment. Mark Canty : What about the concomitant use with another bronchodilator. I can't imagine someone is not going to be on another treatment. Paul Oesterman, Chair: We have the proposed criteri a with removing \"Severe\" and \"Chronic Bronchitis\", the question to the board is do we want to add the Child -Pugh hepatic impairment or not. Dave England: I move to include it. Second. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 22November 20, 2019 Page 13 Paul Oesterman, Chair: The motion is to approve the prior authorization guidelines with everything as is, removing the \"Severe\" and \"Chronic Bronchitis\" language from D and then include a contraindication of individuals with a diagnosis of moderate Ch ild-Pugh B or severe Child-Pugh C hepatic impairment. Motion and second to accept the criteria as amended. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. h.For Possible Action: Discussion and possible adoption of updated prior authorizatio n criteria and/or quantity limits for topical antiparasitics. Paul Oesterman, Chair: The next item is the discussion and poss ible adoption of updated prior authorization criteria and/or quantity limits for topical antip arasitics. Do we have any public comment? Carl Jeffery: This starts on page 145. We are proposing the rem oval of Natroba criteria because we are singling out this agent and there is also a limited supp ly of Sklice. It would be easier to remove the criteria. Sklice should be available at the end of 2 020. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Do any of the managed care organizations have a problem with removing the criteria? Ryan Bitton: No.Paul Oesterman, Chair: Do we have a motion to remove the prior authorization criteria? Motion and second to remove the pri or authorization criteria. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. i.For Possible Action: Discussion and possible adoption of updated prior authorizatio n criteria and/or quantity limits for topical immunomodulators. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Our next topic is the discussion and pos sible adoption of updated prior authorization criteria and/or quantity limits for topical immun omodulators. Do we have any public comment? Carl Jeffery: The P&T asked for this review. There is a letter of support for Eucrisa. You can see in the utilization the drop for when the Board added criteria. I don't have any recommended changes. Holly Long: The letter is printed and is in front of everyone a nd is at the table by the door. We had about 11 or 12 providers supporting Eucrisa to be preferred. Netochi Adeolokun: I have heard good things about Eucrisa. I think we should take away the requirement for a trial of a steroid for two weeks before getti ng it. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 23November 20, 2019 Page 14 Carl Jeffery: If we do that for Eucrisa, we lump them in with Protopic and Elidel as well, do we pull out Eucrisa? Paul Oesterman, Chair : What do the MCO's have to say? Tom Beranek: We are in line with Fee-for-service. We have a dif ferent age of 16 vs. 18 for Protopic. Ryan Bitton: We are also in line with the current recommendatio ns. Lisa Todd: Us too with Anthem. Jim Marx: Are we still going to require a failure of a topical steroid? The problem with that is this creates complications before even starting. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Do we ha ve a recommendation to remove? Jim Marx: I think this should be used first-line. Dave England: The other agents do have some black-box warning, we are requiring something more toxic? Paul Oesterman, Chair : Under coverage and limitations, \"A\" and \"E\" is similar except \" E \" specifies Eucrisa. Dave England: How do we tweak the verbiage to allow it to be us ed first? Paul Oesterman, Chair : It doesn't seem there is a sequential order, any of the topic al agents could be used. Do we want to change the age for Protopic to 16? Mark Canty: The topical steroids are so full of problems. BS: The FDA website says Protopic 0.1% can be used in adults 16 years of age and older, the 0.03% can be used in children two to 15 years. Paul Oesterman, Chair: We have revised the guidelines to three changes. One, removal of bullet point A, second eliminating bullet point E and changing the age of Protopic to age 16 and older. Motion and second to approve the updated guidelines. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. j.For Possible Action: Presentation, discussion and possible adoption of updated DUR Bylaws Paul Oesterman, Chair: That comp leted the clinical presentation . We have one more topic here, the presentation, discussion and possible adoption of updated D UR Bylaws. Is there any public comment? Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 24November 20, 2019 Page 15 Holly Long: We are bringing this back again. We had some sugges tions made by Julie that we remove the public comment piece. We made a lot of updates last time. The only we are doing now is removing the public comment piece that starts on page 11 and goes to page 12. That was not in alignment with open meeting laws. I do need everyone to vote an d it has been approved by the director. Paul Oesterman, Chair: It seems straightforward, we just have t he changes to remove the public comment section to be in compliance with open meeting laws. Any discussion? Motion and second to approve the updated bylaws. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. 5. DUR Board Requested Reports Paul Oesterman, Chair: We have our Board requested reports. Our first is the opioid utilization. Carl Jeffery: Page 171 is where this starts. We added the morph ine equivalent dose. The top prescribers changed now, so the top prescribers are listed. We have an anesthesiologist in the top that is quite a bit higher than t he others. The members are on the next page. Jim Marx: The sum of the MED is the entire dose? Carl Jeffery: I multiples the total number of units by the conv ersion factor to get the final column. Dave England: Is the anesthesiologist a surgery center? Carl Jeffery: No, these are only Fee-for-service claims. These specialties are all self-reported. Paul Oesterman, Chair: When was t he last time we lettered the p rescribers? Holly Long: January. Jim Marx: The first three prescribers, their MME per day is 59 then 74 and 78, so these are not huge numbers. The MED's per day are not much of a concern. Some are as low as 20. Paul Oesterman, Chair: It would be interesting to see at the next meeting to see the impact of the letter that went out in January. And maybe send another letter as an FYI to let them know where they stand. Carl Jeffery: The overall utilization is trending down. Jim Marx : These MME's are very reasonable. My MME's are a lot higher, b ut if I got a letter, I would get a little miffed. Holly Long: The letter is informative not threatening. It goes through the DAG. It lets them know the Board reviewed the information and they are identified as one of the top prescribers. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 25November 20, 2019 Page 16 Jim Marx: I think you may be creating the wrong impression amon g prescribers. You may create a bad rapport with these letters. I think some prescribers are already paranoid and some prescribers have stopped prescribing opioids. I think this is the wrong app roach. Mark Canty: What would you recommend, what MME would you be con cerned. Jim Marx : My MME is probably 250 per day, but I'm in pain management and every practice is different. Holly Long: Education is a big piece, so if you have recommenda tions for education, we can pursue that.Jim Marx: Prescribers need to know how to taper and how to arri ve at the appropriate dose. Dave England: I was looking for CE on how to deal with opiate p rescribing, I can't find anything out there. What other criteria or options do we have? We used t o have some education programs with the College of Medicine. We can't just tell them what not to do, but we need to give them alternatives. I agree with Dr. Marx, we may be barking up the w rong tree. Can we put together a program or webinar? Holly Long : I think that is a great idea. If you have ideas, we can put t hat on the Division's website. The statistics I presented earlier show the polices are effective. Now what more can we do? What can Medicaid realistically cover like massage or chiropractors that would help? Dave England: Since we push decreased opioids, are we seeing an y trends where we see an upswing? Are we doing a better job with alternatives or are the y going somewhere else for their pain treatment. Holly Long : We can try looking at chiropractor requests or are people see king acupuncture. I don't have access to that data. Carl Jeffery: You will see in the overall utilization, gabapentin has moved up, so there is a shift in prescribing. Paul Oesterman, Chair: In the hospital setting, I am seeing a l ot more intravenous acetaminophen. Patients are doing just fine. Holly Long: We can look at other claim information for this, bu t if we want to look at something bigger, we can entertain those ideas. I am always looking at other states, and many can't claim the same success we have. Mark Canty: Have you seen methocarbamol increasing? Using that rather than opioids. Paul Oesterman, Chair: The restrictions on carisopradol many are moving toward methocarbamol or Flexoril. Mark Canty: Seems like a pain indication though. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 26November 20, 2019 Page 17 Jim Marx: I think it is a safer alternative than some others. E ven gabapentin is falling out of favor. Carl Jeffery : It hasn't popped up, but it might be good to look at muscle relaxants. Maybe that is where patients are going. Dave England: The pain needs to be treated somewhere. I don't think we see the whole picture. Jim Marx: Quality of life and productivity has gone down as wel l. There are other factors are not measuring. Holly Long: There are many instances where friends and family s ee addiction in a short amount of time. Paul Oesterman, Chair: I think we have discussed this quite a b it. If anyone has other ideas, send them to Holly. Carl Jeffery: I do have a coup le more details, the report is by member with the MME. I pulled the detail for the top members so you can see what they are getting . These are just opioids. Jim Marx: Remember we looked at acetaminophen a few years ago. Have we looked at that again? Carl Jeffery: Looking at the top ten, there are just a few memb ers getting the combo products with acetaminophen. The methadone is not c alculated in here because of the variability of the dose. Page 175 we move to the benzos. The first page shows the top ten prescribers. These quantities don't really alarm me. Paul Oesterman, Chair: We were looking for the combination of t he opioid and benzo. Carl Jeffery: Right, that is what we are seeing here. These are the top ten prescriber who are also prescribing opioids for those members. So, these members are al so on an opioid. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Can we get a report that shows by patient that is on the benzo and opiate. To see if there is anyone getting excessive amounts. Carl Jeffery : It's hard to present that while maintaining PHI, but I will t ry getting something like that.Paul Oesterman, Chair: Do any of the managed care organizations want to highlight some outliers? Ryan Bitton: We see the same trend, nothing really we need to c all out. Lisa Todd: We looked at the top opioid prescribers, they were n o the top benzo prescribers, we did not have any overlap. Tom Beranek: We see the same for SilverSummit. The opioid and b enzos, two doctors stand out, so we are sending them letters. We haven't received a response yet. The top members are on the list because they are using Suboxone products. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 27November 20, 2019 Page 18 Carl Jeffery: On page 176 is the Fee-for-service report you are looking for. This shows the opiate prescribers and the letter match back to the top ten opioid fro m the opioid report. Then it goes over to what benzo they were prescribing and how many. So, this shows our top opioid prescribers are not big benzo prescribers. Ryan Bitton: We had 12,000 members using an opioid, 4,000 using a benzo and 1,500 on a combo. Most patients using opioids are not using benzos. Lisa Todd: I did run the top benzo prescribers for first quarte r and second quarter. There were five benzo prescribers that showed up in each quarter in the top. Ot herwise, none of the prescribers are in the top ten opioid prescribers. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Sounds like our prescribers are doing go od things. Tom Beranek: I looked at our top opioid utilizing members, of t he top ten, four are seeing a physician that also shows as the top prescribers. We are sendin g them letters. Mark Canty: Are members on hospice in the Fee-for-service progr am? Carl Jeffery : We can look, but hospice will be paying for most opioids and benzos, so we don't get that information. Paul Oesterman, Chair: The next report is the lock-in program. Carl Jeffery: Page 178, we have 886 patients in lock-in, we have added three, two and six members in the past three months. We send a list of members to DHCFP ev ery month with twelve or more controlled substances within 60 days, two or more prescribers a nd two or more pharmacies. We send that list to DHCFP and review the diagnosis and let us kno w who to lock-in. The numbers we lock-in are moving down every month. Holly Long: This information that goes to a nurse at DHCFP who also reviews the PMP report. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Have we been able to reduce the members in lock-in? Holly Long : We don't ever remove someone from lock -in. Once they are locked- in, they don't have a chance to abuse and go other places. After we made the form to change pharmacies, we have received fewer complaints. Tom Beranek: We are trending the same, about 60 or 65 members. We dropped down to 58 because if they don't have a claim for a year, we drop them from lock-in. Ryan Bitton: We have 444 and a dded 24 in the second quarter. We review every year and most stay locked-in. Lisa Todd: For Anthem, we started with 373. We are looking at m ore than pharmacies claims like behavioral health to see if there is an opportunity to see if t hey may benefit from case management. Maybe they need help elsewhere. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 28November 20, 2019 Page 19 Jim Marx : What is the procedure with a supply chain problem. If a pharm acy can't get a certain medication? Holly Long: That would be a call on a case-by-case bases and th ey would be given an override. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Next we ha ve naloxone prescriptions for members receiving opioids. Carl Jeffery: I put a summary on the top of the page of how man y received a prescription for the naloxone nasal spray. We have 303 members on opioid with a nalo xone prescription and it goes down from there, 280 with two prescriptions of Narcan. I broke down to what opioids people are getting that are receiving the nasal spray. The highest number with the hydrocodone and acetaminophen products. Jim Marx: Why would someone get naloxone and Suboxone at the sa me time? Carl Jeffery : They may not be overlapping, this is a year's worth of data. So maybe they started treatment. Paul Oesterman, Chair : MCO's, si milar numbers? Ryan Bitton: We had abo ut 28,000 opioid claims and 224 naloxone claims, so about 0.8%. Of the 28,000 claims, there is a small amount of naloxone. First quart er we saw an increase in claims but tapered off. Paul Oesterman, Chair: I think there could be an education oppo rtunity for prescribers that naloxone is available. Tom Beranek: Looking at the total opioids is going down and nal oxone is going up, a good trend. Paul Oesterman, Chair: I wonder how many are getting refills on the naloxone? Dave England: Could we look at hospital admissions? Carl Jeffery: That is hard data to get. If they are admitted fo r something unrelated, they may have opioid abuse diagnosis. Lisa Todd: From Anthem, I pulled the data from January to June, we had 539 member that received naloxone. Jim Marx: Is there a way to break down chronic use vs. acute us e. The chronic users are more likely to have an overdose and I think it is better to focus on getting them appropriate therapy. Carl Jeffery : We didn't look at chronic vs. acute therapy. I could see if someone getting an acut e treatment with an opioid, but they have a high-risk family memb er, they are a good candidate for getting naloxone. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Moving to our next report on darbepoetin . Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 29November 20, 2019 Page 20 Carl Jeffery: I think we wanted to look at ESRD claims. I pulled a diagnosis where I could, anemia is on the top. Utilization over all is descending for Aranesp. Tom Beranek: Nothing really to call out. Ryan Bitton: We looked at place of service, mostly used for can cer. Lisa Todd: Anthem is the same. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Our last report is in regards to antimic robial therapy, third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and oxazolidinones. Carl Jeffery: On page 185 to follow along. We did a lot of prep work for this policy, it is starting to creep back up. We have not heard many problems. Holly Long: Once we explained the policy, I think everything is moving smoothly. I have not received any appeals or phone calls demanding the policy needs a change. Paul Oesterman, Chair: I think we should send some communicatio n to the prescribers with the antimicrobial stewardship program so they know we look at other things other than opioids. Carl Jeffery: The proof will be in the isolets if we can show resistance is not as much as it used to be. Holly Long: Other states are excited to hear how our program is working out. Tom Beranek: We already had all the drugs on prior authorization, the only one we don't have criteria is the generic ciprofloxacin, it can be used. Our numbers were about the same. Ryan Bitton: We did see a drop in cefdinir in March and continu es to drop. But some of the products where already on the PDL. Paul Oesterman, Chair: As we get to cough and cold, flu season is we need to let prescribers know it is ok to send a member out without a prescription for an ant ibiotic. Lisa Todd: Anthem didn't adopt the criteria, but we do have some of these products on our PDL, we didn't really see the drop-in use like Fee-for-service. Paul Oesterman, Chair: We received a letter from pulmonary associates requesting smoking cessation added to a future meeting. 6. Standard DUR Reports Paul Oesterman, Chair: Our standard DUR reports. Carl Jeffery: Page 187 we have our top ten therapeutic classes. Hemophilia is still number one followed by antiretrovirals and anticonvulsants a little further down. When we look at the report by claim count, we see an increase in gabapentin. The opioids are now dropped to number four. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 30November 20, 2019 Page 21 We still have the beta-agonists toward the top too. We put some quantity limits on albuterol, but they are were not effective at the time of the report. Paul Oesterman, Chair: Do we stil l see a decrease in the hepati tis C agents? Carl Jeffery: Yes, they are dropping significantly. It has not gone away completely. The ProDUR reports are the standard report we see every meeting with drug- drug interactions are the top. Not all of them have hard stops, some are just messages so they wil l be paid without rejecting. On page 190 shows the specifics for the different messages. The d uplicate Rx may be due to our physician administered drug claim processing. Our RetroDUR activities include April letters for diabetics without a statin. In May we reviewed zolpidem utiliza tion, mostly among FDA recommendations for dose in women and long-term use. We also r eviewed benzodiazepine use in members over 65 years of age. We also reviewed extended opioid use disorder without cancer or HIV medications who are receiving an opioid. Paul Oesterman, Chair : Do any of our MCO's have comments? Lisa Todd: From Anthem, the top ten drug classes. Our antiretro virals are number one. It is interesting the anticonvulsants by claim count, our NSAIDs went to the top and then we have anticonvulsants are number three. Opioid combos are number nine on the list. Regarding our quarter DUR report, our biggest DUR is therapeutic duplication, early refill and high dose are the top three. Nothing out of ordinary. For RetroDUR, one thing you asked about before, I brought results. The last meeting we reported on medication adherence w as one of our clinical programs. They were non- adherent to diabetes medications or cholesterol. We don't ask f or letters to be returned from providers, but we take about six months and look at claims to see if there is a positive outcome. We saw a positive outcome, 922 out of 2673 which is 34% positive outcome on that one. A new one we started, called gaps of care. We look at adherence to asthma, cardiovascular guidelines, post MI, statins, a big area of gaps of care. We id entified 113 members and there was a positive outcome of 15%. I have two more listed around behavi oral health. We have a good positive outcome on that, 299 members identified that were expe riencing polypharmacy for behavioral health and we had a positive outcome of 75.9%. We a lso did an age appropriateness for behavioral health, we had 21 out of 31 member which is 67.7 %. Ryan Bitton: The top ten, opioids and SSRIs swap from quarter o ne to quarter two. Everything else is the same from cost and claim count. From the RetroDUR, we looked at lots of gaps if care. The one of things we did was look at duplicate HIV regimens. We notify prescribers that the member may be on unnecessary therapy. Tom Beranek: My comments could almost mirror Lisa's in terms of the top ten drugs from the cost and claim standpoint. The difference with the DUR is the third from the top is ingredient duplication. We continue to choose a new topic for RetroDUR eve ry quarter and send out letters each month. 7. Closing Discussion Paul Oesterman, Chair: Great. Is there any public comment? The next meeting is here, January 23, 2020. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do 31November 20, 2019 Page 22 Holly Long: I would like to announce a big thank you for Dr. Oe sterman.

Endnotes A. According to the National MS Society, of the four disease courses that have been identified in MS, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is characterized primarily by relapses, and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) has both relapsing and prog ressive characteristics. These two constitute \"relapsing forms of MS\" i f they describe a disease course that is characterized by the occurrence of relapses. [7] The effectiveness of interferon beta in SPMS patients without relapses is uncertain. [6] B. Initiation of treatment with an interferon beta medication or glatiramer acetate should be considered as soon as possible following a definite diagnosis o f MS with active, relapsing disease, and may also be considered for selected pati ents with a first attack who are at high risk of MS. [6] C. Based on several years of experience with glatiramer acetate and interferon beta 1a and 1b, it is the consensus of researchers and clinicians with expertise in MS that these agents are likely to reduce future disease activity and improve quality of life for many individuals with relapsing forms of MS, including those with se condary progressive disease who continue to have relapses. For those who are approp riate candidates for one of these drugs, treatment must be sustained for years. Cess ation of treatment may result in a resumption of pre-treatment disease activity. [6] D. MS specialists will use Copaxone in relapsing forms of disea se, including SPMS with relapses. While there have been no trials of Copaxone in SPMS ( so we have no evidenced-based data upon which to make decisions or recommenda tions), it's clear that where there are relapses, the injectable therapies are par tially effective - they reduce relapses and new lesions on MRI. In SPMS, the trials sug gest that the interferons work better in earlier, more inflammatory (i.e. tho se with relapses prior to the trial and with gadolinium-enhancing lesions, which is the MRI e quivalent of active inflammation). Since Copaxone and the interferons appear to hav e rather similar efficacy in the head-to-head trials, most assume that Copaxone has a sim ilar efficacy in SPMS: where there are relapses or active inflammation on MRI, it will likely have some benefit. Thus, most MS specialists will use Copaxone in patients with SP MS who have persistent relapses. [8] E. According to Prescribing Information, the recommended dosage of Lemtrada is 12 mg/day administered by intravenous infusion for 2 treatment cou rses (first treatment course: 12 mg/day on 5 consecutive second treatment cours e: 12 mg/day on 3 42consecutive days administered 12 months after the first treatme nt course). Following the second treatment course, subsequent treatment courses of 12 mg per day on 3 consecutive days (36 mg total dose) may be administered, as needed, at least 12 months after the last dose of any prior treatment courses. [13] F. Not to exceed the FDA-recommended dosage of 2 treatment cour ses (with the second course administered 43 weeks following the last dose of the fir st course). According to Prescribing Information, the recommended cumulative dosage of M avenclad is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearl y treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course). Each treatment course is divid ed into 2 treatment cycles with the second cycle of each course administered 23 to 27 days after the last dose of the first cycle. Following the administration of 2 trea tment courses, do not administer additional Mavenclad treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating Mavenclad more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied. [19] 4 . References 1. Avonex Prescribing Information. Biogen Idec Inc.

Therapeutic Class Overview Multiple Sclerosis Agents INTRODUCTION Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chr onic, immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system ( CNS), is the leading cause of disability in young and middle- aged people in developed area s of the world (MS Coalition 2018) . MS is characterized by repeated episodes of inflammation within the brain and spina l cord, resulting in injury to the myelin sheaths that surround and insulate nerves, and subsequently the nerve cell a xons (Goodin et al 2002) . There are 4 of MS: o Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), whi ch is characterized by acute attacks followed by partial or full recovery. This is the most common form of MS, acco unting for 80 to 85% of cases. o Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) begins as RRMS; however, the at tack rate declines over time. Patients experience a gradual deteriorati on. Patients with RRMS for more than 10 years may transition to SPMS. o Primary progressive MS (PPMS) o ccurs in approximately 10% of pa tients with MS. Patient s have a continuous and gradual decline in function without evidence of acute attacks. o Clinically isolated syndrome (CI S) refers to the first episode of neurologic symptoms that l asts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation or demyelination in the CNS (Goodin et al 2002, Sanvito et al 2011, National MS Society 2019[a]) . A more recent revision of the MS clinical course descriptions r ecommended that the core MS phenotype descriptions of relapsing and progressive disease be retained with some of the following modifications: (1) an important modifier of these core phenotypes is an assessment of disease activity, as defined by clinical assessment of relapse occurrence or lesion activity detec ted by CNS imaging; 2) the second importa nt modifier of these phenoty pes is a determination of whether progression of disability has occurred ov er a given tim e period; and (3) the prior category of PRMS can be eliminated since subjects so cate gorized would now be classifie d as PPMS patients with disease activity (Lublin et al 2014) . An estimated 1 million adults in the United States have been di agnosed with MS. Most pati ents are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and MS is reported more frequently in women than in men (National MS Society 2019[b]) . Diagnosis of MS requires evi dence of damage in at least 2 separate areas of the CNS, evidence of damage that occurred at 2 separate time poi nts at least 1 month apart, and that other possible diagnos es have been ruled out. The clinically isolated syndrome (CIS ) includes 1 attack and objective evidence of 1 lesion (Thompson et al 2018) . Following CIS, the course of MS is variabl e. The inclusion of CIS in the spectrum of MS phenotypes wit h prospective follow-up of most such patients determining their subsequent disease phenotype was also recommended in the recent revision of the MS clinical course descriptions (Lublin et al 2014) . Disease-modifying therapies (DM Ts) delay the development from C IS to clinically definite MS (CDMS) (Miller et al 2012, Armoiry et al 2018) . Evaluation includes an extensive patient history, neurological examination, laboratory tests to rule out other possible causes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for new disease an d signs of more chronic damage, and possibly lumbar puncture ( Thompson et al 2018 ). Exacerbations, also known as flar es, relapses, or attacks of MS are caused by inflammation in the CNS that leads to damage to the myelin and slows or blocks transmission of nerve impulses. An exacerbation must last at least 24 hours and be separated from a previou s exacerbation by at least 30 da ys. Exacerbations can be mild or severe. Intravenous (IV) corticosteroids may be used to treat severe exacerbations of MS. Corticosteroids decrease acute inflammation in the CNS but do not provide any long-term benefits (Frohman et al 2007) . The approach to treating MS includes the management of symptoms, treatment of acute relap ses and utiliz ation of DMTs to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, reduce l esions on MRI scans, and possibly delay disease and disability progression (Rae-Grant et al 2018[b]) . The American Academy of Neurol ogy (AAN), the European Committ ee for Research and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the European Academy of Neu rology (EAN) recently updated their guidelines on MS. Both guidelines recommend initiation of DMTs treatment early on in the patient's disease course ( Rae Grant et al 2018[b], Montalban et al 2018 ). The MS Coalition, the AAN , and the Association of British Neurologists guidelines s upport access to the available DMTs for patients with MS . While there are no precise algorithms to determine the orde r of product selection, therapy should be individualized and patients' 46 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 2 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY In the management of MS, numerous clinical trials have establis hed the safety and efficacy of the biologic response modifiers in reducing the frequenc y of relapses lesions on MRI scans, and possibly delayi ng disease progression and disability. Interferons and glatiramer acetate Pivotal clinical tria ls demonstrating effi cacy in reducing the rate of relapses, burden of disease on MRI, and disability progression for the interferons and glatiramer acetate were pub lished in the 1990's (Jacobs et al 1996, Johnson et al, 48 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 4 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Long-term follow-up data for IFN -1b show that overall surviva l in MS is improved (Goodin et al 2012) . Head-to-head trials have found (IFN-1a SC), and Betaseron (IFN-1b) to be comparable in terms of relapse rate reduction and disease and disability progression (PRISMS 1998, Kappos et al 2006, Mikol et al 2008, Flechter et al 2002, Cadavid et al 2009, O'Connor et al 2009) . The results of several studies suggest that lower dose Avonex (IFN-1a 30 mcg intramus cular [IM] once weekly) may be less efficacious while being more tolerable compared to higher do se Rebif (IFN-1a subcutaneous [ SC] 3 times weekly or every other day) or glatiramer acetate (Khan et al 2001[a], Khan et al 2001[b], Barbero et al 2006, Durelli et al 2002, Panitch et al 2002, Panitch et al 2005, Schwid et al 2005, Schwid et al 2007, Traboulsee et al 2008) . In a meta-analysis of 5 randomiz ed studies comparing IFNs with glatiramer acetate, there were no significant differences between IFNs and glatiramer aceta te in terms of the number of p atients with relapses, c onfirmed progression, or discontinuation due to adverse events at 24 months (La Mantia et al 2016) . o At 36 months, however, evidence fr om a single study suggested t hat relapse rates were higher in the group given IFNs than in the glatiramer ace tate group (risk ratio [RR] 1.40 , 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1 .13 to 1.74; p = 0.002). While MRI outcomes analysis showed that effects on newer enlarg ing T2 or new contrast-enhancing T1 lesions at 24 months were similar, the reducti on in T2- and T1-weighted lesio n volume was significantly g reater in the groups given IFNs than in the glatiramer ace tate groups (mean difference [MD ] 0.58, 95% CI: 0.99 to 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.07; p = 0.003, respectively). In a network meta-analysis of 24 studies comparing IFNs and gla tiramer acetate, both dr ugs were found to reduce the annualized relapse rate (ARR) as compared to placebo but did no t differ statistically from each other ( Melendez-Torres et al 2018 ). Ranking of the drugs based on SUCRA (surface under the cumulative ranking curv e) indicated that glatiramer acetate 20 mg once daily had t he highest probability for superiority, followed by peginterferon -1a 125 mcg every 2 weeks. A meta-analysis of 6 placebo-c ontrolled trials failed to find a significant advantage of Av onex (IFN-1a) 30 mcg IM once weekly compared to placebo in the number of relapse-free patien ts after 1 year of therapy ( Freedman et al 2008 ). In contrast, other studi es found Avonex (IFN-1a) 30 mcg IM once weekly to be comparable to t he other IFN products in terms of relapse rate reducti on, disability progression, and SPMS development (Carra et al 2008, Limmroth et al 2007, Minagara et al 2008, Rio et al 2005, Tr ojano et al 2003, Trojano et al 2007) . Moreover, IFN therapy, especially the higher dose products, is associated with the production of neutralizin g antibodies (NAb), which may result in decreased radiographic and clinical effectiveness of treatment (Goodin et al 2007, Sorensen et al 2005) . Exploratory post-hoc analyses of the PRISMS trial linked the development of NAb with reduced efficacy (Alsop et al 2005) . Development of NAb among patients (N = 368) rand omized to receive Rebif (IFN- 1a) 44 or 22 mcg SC 3 time s weekly for 4 years was associated with higher relapse r ates (adjusted relapse rate rat io, 1.41; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1. 78; p = 0.004), a greater number of active lesions, and percentage change in T2 lesion bu rden from baseline on MRI s can (p < 0.001). In a systematic review of 40 studie s of MS agents including IFN-1a and IFN-1b, the primary outcome measure was the frequency of IFN NAb (Govindappa et al 2015) . NAb development was most frequent with IFN -1b, followed by IFN - 1a SC, and lowest with IFN -1a IM. Higher doses were associate d with a higher rate of NAb development. The CombiRx trial evaluated the combination of Copaxone (glatir amer acetate) and Avonex (IF N-1a IM) over 3 years. The ARR for the combination therapy (IFN-1a + gl atiramer) was not statistically superior to the better of the 2 single treatment arms (glatiramer) (p = 0.27). The ARRs were 0.12 for the combination therapy, 0. 16 for IFN-1a, and 0.11 for glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer ac etate performed significantly better than IFN-1a, reducing th e risk of exacerbation by 31% (p = 0.027), and IFN-1a + gl atiramer acetate performed significantly better than IFN -1a, reducing the risk of exacerbation by 25% ( p = 0.022). The 3 treatment groups did not show a significant differenc e in disability progression over 6 months. Combination therapy was superior to either monot herapy in reducing new lesion activity and accumulation of total lesion volume (Lublin et al 2013) . It is estimated that within a fe w years of initiating treatment , at least 30 and 15% of patients discontinue MS biological response modifiers d ue to perceived lack of efficacy or side ef fects, respectively (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . According to several observational studies, switching patients who have failed to adequately respond to initial treatment to another first-line therapy is safe and effective (Caon et al 2006, Zwibel 2006, Carra et al 2008) . Patients switching to glatiramer acetate after experiencing inadequate response to IFN-1a therapy experienced a reduction in relapse rates and disability progression. Likew ise, switching to IFN-1a ther apy after suboptimal efficacy with glatiramer acetate increased the number of relaps e-free patients in 1 study (Carra et al 2008) . The smallest reducti on in the ARR was seen in patients who had switched from one IFN-1a preparation to an other. 49 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 5 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The GALA study evaluated glatiramer acetate SC 40 mg 3 times weekly compared to plac ebo in 1404 patients with relapsing MS over 12 months. Resul ts demonstrated that glatiram er acetate 40 mg 3 times weekly, compared to placebo, reduced the ARR and MRI endpoints (Khan et al 2013) . Glatiramer acetate 20 mg daily and 40 mg 3 times weekly have not been directly compared for efficacy. A Phase 3 dose comparison study evaluated glatiramer acetate 20 mg and 40 mg each given daily in 1155 patients with MS. The primary endpoint, mean ARR, was s imilar in both groups: ARR = 0 .33 (20 mg group) vs ARR = 0.35 (40 mg group). For patients from both groups who co mpleted the entire 1-year treatment period, the mean ARR = 0.27 (Comi et al 2011) . The efficacy and safety of Plegridy (peginterferon -1a) in adult patients with MS (N = 1516) were evaluated in ADVANCE, a Phase 3, multicenter , randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible adult patie nts had RRMS with baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 5 and 2 clinica lly documented relapses in the previous 3 years with at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. Patients were random ized to placebo or SC peginterferon -1a 125 mcg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Approximately 81% of patients were treatment na\u00efve. o At week 48, ARRs were significa ntly lower in the peginterferon -1a every 2 week group ( ARR = 0.256; p = 0.0007) and peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR = 0.288; p = 0.0 114) compared to placebo (ARR = 0.397). o There were also significant differences between the peginterfer on -1a every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks groups compared to placebo in the proportion of patients with relapse at week 48 (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.02, respectively). The proportions of patients with 12 weeks of sustained disabili ty progression at the end of the 48 week study period were significantly lower in the peginterferon -1a groups (both 6.8%; p = 0.0383 for ever y 2 weeks group; p = 0.038 for every 4 weeks group) co mpared to placebo (10.5%). o The mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesio ns on MRI were significantly reduced in the peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks group compared to placebo (3.6 lesions vs 10.9 lesions , respectively; p < 0.0001). Significant beneficial effects on the mean number of Gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions were also observed with peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks compared to placebo (p < 0.000 1). o During the 48 weeks of treatmen t, the most commonly reported ad verse effects included influenza-like illness and injection site erythema. Disc ontinuations due to adverse effect s were higher in the pegi nterferon -1a groups compared to placebo (Calabresi et al 2014b) . o NAb to interferon -1a were identified in < 1% of all groups after 1 year (peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks, 4 patients; peginterferon -1a eve 4 weeks, 2 2 patients) (Calabresi et al 2014b) . Preliminary data on NAb development to peginterfer on -1a over 2 y ears showed < 1% for all groups (White et al 2014) . The ADVANCE study continued into a second year. Patients origin ally randomized to placebo were re-randomized to peginterferon -1a (the \"placebo- switch group\"). Peginterferon -1a patients were continued on their original assigned therapy. A total of 1332 patient s entered the second year of th e study. After 96 weeks, the AR R was significantly lower in the peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks group (ARR 0.221; p = 0 .0001 vs placebo-switch group ; p = 0.0209 vs every 4 week regimen) compared to both t he placebo-switch group (ARR 0.351) and the peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR 0.291). The peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR 0.2 91; p = NS vs placebo-sw itch group) was not significantly different than the placebo-switch group (ARR 0.35 1) after 96 weeks based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks was also associated with a lower proportion of patients who had relapse and a lower proportion of patients who had disability progression. Mean number of new or newl y enlarging T2-weight hyperintense MRI lesions over 2 years was numerically lower wit h the peginterferon - 1a every 2 weeks group compared to the placebo-switch group (Calabresi et al 2014b, Kieseier et al 2015) . The ATTAIN study was an open-lab el extension of the ADVANCE stu dy, where patients were followed for an additional 2 years ( Newsome et al 2018 ). Of the original ADVANCE pati ents, 71% continued into the ATT AIN study, and 78% of those patients completed the ex tension study. The primary objec tive of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety of peginterferon -1a. During the study, the common adverse events were influenza-like illne ss (43%), injection site erythema (41%), and headache ( 29%). The rate of treatment-relat ed serious adverse even ts was 1%. The adjusted ARR and risk of relaps e was reduced significantly with the ever y 2 weeks compared to the ev ery 4 weeks dosing group (0.188 2 large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults against placebo and against Avonex (IFN-1a IM). In FREEDOMS, a 24-month placebo-co ntrolled trial, fingolimod (0.5 and 1.25 mg once daily) was associated with signi ficant reductions in ARR compared to placebo (54 and 60%, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Moreover, fingolim od was associated wi th reductions in d isability progression and a prolonged time to first relapse compared to placebo (Kappos et al 2010) . In the 12-month TRANSFORMS tr ial, fingolimod 0.5 and 1.25 mg once daily 50 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 6 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In a 12-month extens ion of TRANSFORMS, patients initially randomized to IFN-1a IM were switched to either dose of fingo limod for 12 additional months and experienced significant reductions in ARR compared to initial treatment with IFN- 1a IM. Patients switched from IF N-1a IM to fingolimod experienced fewer adverse events compared to treatment with IFN-1a IM in the core study (86 vs 91% and 91 vs 94% for the 0.5 and 1.25 mg groups, respectively; p values not repor ted). Fewer patients continuing fingolimod from the core stu dy reported adverse events in the extension period compared to the core study (72 vs 86% a nd 71 vs 90% for the 0.5 and 1.25 mg doses, respectively; p va lues not reported) (Khatri et al 2011) . The TRANSFORMS extension st udy followed patients for up to 4.5 years with results consisten t with those observed in the fi rst 12 months of the extension study; however, there was significant attrition bias with very few patients enrolled past 36 months (Cohen et al 2015) . In the FREEDOMS II study, a 24-month placebo-controlled study, fingolimod (0.5 mg and 1.25 m g) significantly reduced ARR compared to placebo (48 and 50%, respectively ; both p < 0.0 001) (Calabresi et al 2014a) . Mean percentage brain volume change was lower with both fingolimod doses compared to placebo. Fingolimod did not show a significant effect on time to disability progression at 3 months compared to place bo. Fingolimod has also been evaluat ed in pediatric patients with r elapsing MS ( Chitnis et al 2018). The PARADIGMS trial randomized patients between 10 an d 17 years of age to fingolimod 0.5 mg daily (0.25 mg for patients 40 kg) or IFN- 1a IM 30 mcg weekly for up to 2 years. Fingolimod significantly reduced ARR compared to IFN -1a IM (adjusted rates, 0.12 vs 0.67; relative differenc e of 82%; p < 0.001). Fingolimod was also associated with a 53% relative reduction in the annualized rate of new or newly enlarged lesions. However, seri ous adverse events occurr ed more frequently with fingolimod than IFN-1a IM (16.8% vs 6.5%). Aubagio (teriflunomide) Efficacy and safety of Aubagio were evaluated in two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials - the TEMSO trial ( O'Connor et al, 2011 ) and the TOWER trial (Confavreux et al 2014) . In the TEMSO trial, 1088 patients with relapsing MS were randomized to te riflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for a total of 108 weeks. Results demonstrated that compared to p lacebo, teriflunomide at both doses, reduced the ARR. o The percentage of pat ients with confirmed disability progressio n (CDP) was significant ly lower only in the teriflunomide 14 mg group (20.2% ) compared to placebo (27.3%; p = 0.03) (O'Connor et al 2011) . Teriflunomide has demonstrated beneficial effects on MRI scans in a Phase 2, randomized, doubl e-blind, clinical trial. A total of 179 patients with MS were randomized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for 36 weeks and were followed every 6 weeks with MRI s cans during the treatment peri od. The teriflunomide groups had significant reductions in the average number of unique active lesions per MRI scan (O'Connor et al 2006) . In the TOWER trial, 1165 patients with relapsing MS were random ized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for at least 48 weeks of ther apy. The study ended 48 weeks afte r the last patient was randomized. Results demonstrated that, compared to p lacebo, teriflunomide 14 mg sig nificantly reduced the ARR and the risk of sustained accumulation of disability (Confavreux et al 2014) . Teriflunomide and Rebif were comp ared in the 48-week TENERE study evaluating 324 patients with relapsing MS. The primary outcome, time to failure defined as a confirmed relapse or permanent discontinuation for any cause, was comparable for teriflunomi de 7 mg and 14 mg and Rebif o Phase 3 stud ies: DEFINE and CONFIRM (Gold et al 2012, Fox et al 2012, Xu et al 2015) . DEFINE was a multicenter RCT t hat compared 2 dosing regimens of dimethyl fumarate (240 mg twice daily and 240 mg 3 times da ily) to placebo in patients with RRMS. There were 1237 patients enrolled, and the trial duration was 96 weeks. Results d emonstrated that, compared to placebo, treatment with both doses of dimethyl fumarate reduced the proportion of patients with a relapse with in 2 years, the ARR, the number of lesions on MRI, and the proportion of patients with disability progression (Gold et al 2012) . CONFIRM was a multicenter RCT t hat compared 2 dosing regimens o f dimethyl fumarate (240 mg twice daily and 240 mg 3 times daily) to placebo, with an additional, open-label st udy arm evaluating glatiramer acetate 20 mg SC daily. Glatiramer acetate was included as a reference comparator, but the study was not designed to test the superiority or non-inferiority of dimethyl fuma rate vs glatiramer acetate. The re were 1430 patients enrolled, and the trial duration was 96 weeks. Results of CONFIRM were similar to DEFINE, with the e xception that there was no significant difference between groups in the likelihood of disability progression. The CONFIRM trial demonstrated that, compared to placebo, 51 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 7 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Tysabri (natalizumab) Tysabri (natalizumab) reduced the risk of experiencing at least 1 new exacerbation at 2 y ears and reduced the risk of experiencing progression at 2 years (Polman et al 2006, Pucci et al 2011, Rudick et al 2006) . The AFFIRM trial compared natalizumab to placebo in patients with MS with less t han 6 months of treatment experience with any DMT. Natalizumab reduced the ARR at 1 and 2 years compared to placeb o. The cumulative probabilit y of sustained disability progression and lesion burden on MRI were significantly reduced with natalizumab compared to placebo (Polman et al 2006) . In the SENTINEL trial, nataliz umab was compared to placebo in patients who were receiving IFN-1a IM 30 mcg once weekly for at least 1 year. T he combination of natalizumab plus IFN-1a IM resulted in a significant reduction in ARR at year 1 and 2 and significant reduction in cumulative pro bability of sustained disabilit y progression at year 2. Lesion burden on MRI was also significantly reduced with the co mbination therapy. Two cas es of PML were reported in the SENTINEL patient population resulting in the early terminat ion of the trial (Rudick et al 2006) . Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) The efficacy and of alem compared to Rebif (IFN-1a SC) in two Phase 3, open-label trials in patients with relapsi ng forms of MS - CARE-MS I and C ARE-MS II ( Cohen et al 2012, Coles et al 2012) . In the 2-year studies, patients were randomized to alemtuzumab infused for 5 consecutive days followed by a 3 consecutive day treatment course 12 months lat er or to Rebif (IFN-1a SC) 4 4 mcg 3 times weekly after an initial dosage titration. All patients received methylprednisolo ne 1 g IV for 3 consecutive d ays at the initiation of tr eatment and at month 12. o The CARE-MS I trial enrolled treat ment-na\u00efve patients with MS ( n = 581) who were high functioning based on the requirement of a score of 3 or lower on the EDSS. o Patients (n = 840) enrolled in t he CARE-MS II trial had experie nced at least 1 relapse while on IFN or glatiramer acetate after at least 6 months of treatment. Patients were req uired to have an EDSS score of 5. o The co-primary endpoints for both trials were the relapse rate and the time to 6-month sustained accumulation of disability. o In the CARE-MS I trial, alemtuz umab reduced the risk of relapse 55% compared to IFN-1a SC (p < 0.0001). Relapses were in alemtuzumab-treated patients a nd 40% of IFN-1a SC patients over 2 years. The proportion of patients having su stained accumulation of disabil ity over 6 months was not significantly different between alemtuzumab (8%) vs IFN-1a SC (11%) (p = uzumab significa ntly reduced relapse disability compared to IFN-1a SC. The rela pse rate at 2 years was reduced by 49% with alemtuzumab (p < 0.0001). The percent of patients with sustai ned accumulation of disability c onfirmed over 6 months was 13% with alemtuzumab and 20% with IFN-1a SC, represent ing a 42% risk reduction with alemtuzumab (p = 0.0084). o Both studies evaluated MRI outco mes, specifically the median pe rcent change in T2 hyperintense lesion volume from baseline. Neither study found a significant difference between the 2 drugs for this measure. o During extension studies of CAR E-MS I and CARE-MS II, approxima tely 80% of patients pr eviously treated with alemtuzumab did not require additional treatment during the fir st year (Garnock-Jones 2014) . A Cochrane review by Zhang et al (2017) that compared the effic acy, tolerability, and safety of alemtuzumab vs IFN-1a in the treatment of RRMS identified 3 RCTs in 1694 total patients from the CARE-MS I, CARE-MS II, and CAMMS223 studies. In the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group, the results showed statistically significan t differences in reducing relapses (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0. 52 to 0.70); preventing disease progression (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.79); and developing new T2 lesions on MRI (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0. 93) after 24 and 36 months' follow-up, but found no statistically significant diffe rence in the changes of EDSS sco re (MD = -0.35, 95% CI: -0.73 to 0.03). In the alemtuzumab 24 mg/day group, the results show ed statistically significant d ifferences in reducing relaps es (RR = 0.38, 95% CI: 95% to 0.84); (MD = 95% CI: reported adverse effe cts with alemtuzumab were infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune event s. Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) The Phase 3 clinical developmen t program for ocrelizumab (ORCHE STRA) included 3 stud ies: OPERA I, OPERA II, and ORATORIO (Hauser et al 2017[a], Montalban et al 2017) . 52 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 8 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. o OPERA I and OPERA II were 2 identi cally-designed, the eff icacy and safety of ocrelizumab (600 mg administered as an IV infusion given as 2-300 mg infusions separated by 2 weeks for dose 1 and then as a single 600 mg infusion every 6 months fo r subsequent doses) compared w ith Rebif (IFN-1a; 44 mcg administered by SC injection 3 times per week ) in 1656 patients with RMS (Hauser et al 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov Web site, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017) . Across both studies, the majori ty of patients had not been trea ted with a DMT in the 2 years before screening (range: 71.4% to 75.3%); of those patients that had received a previous DMT as allowed by the protocol, most received IFN (18.0% to 21.0%) or glatiramer acetate (9.0% to 10 .6%). Two patients previously treated with natalizumab for < 1 year were in cluded, while 5 patients previo usly treated with fingolimod and 1 patient previously treated with dimethyl fumarate ( both not within 6 months of scr eening) were also included. Ocrelizumab achieved statistically significant reductions in th e ARR vs Rebif across both trials (primary endpoint). OPERA I (0.16 vs 0.29; 46% lower rate with ocrelizumab; p < 0. 001) OPERA II (0.16 vs 0.29; 47% lower rate; p < 0.001) In pre-specified pooled analyses (secondary endpoints), the per centage of patients with disability progression confirmed at 12 weeks was statistically significantly lower wit h ocrelizumab vs Rebif (9.1% vs 13.6%; hazard ratio [HR] 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.81; p < 0.001). The results were similar for disability pr ogression conf irmed at 24 weeks: 6.9% 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.84; p = 0.00 3. The percentages of pat ients with disability improvement confirmed at 12 week s were 20.7% in the ocrelizumab group vs 15.6% in the Rebif group (33% higher rate of improvement w ith ocrelizumab; p = 0.02). The mean numbers of Gd-enhancing lesions per T1-weighted MRI scan were statistically sig nificantly reduced with ocrelizumab vs Rebif (secondary endpoint). rati = 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.10 ; 94% lower number of lesions with ocrelizumab; p < 0.001) OPERA II: 0.02 vs 0.42 (rate ra tio = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.0 9; 95% lower number o f lesions; p < 0.001) The most common adverse events we re infusion-related reactions and infections. o No opportunistic infections, inc luding PML, were reported in an y group over the duration of either trial. An imbalance of malignancies was observed with ocrelizumab; acr oss both studies and through 96 weeks, neoplasms occurred in 0.5% (4/825) of ocrelizumab-treated patie ocrelizumab-treated pat ients that developed neoplasms , there were 2 cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma, 1 case of renal-cell carcinoma, and 1 case of malign ant melanoma. Rebif-treated patients with neoplasms included 1 case of mant le-cell lymphoma and 1 case of squamous-cell carcinoma in the chest. Between the clinical cutoff dat es of the 2 trials (April 2, 20 15 [OPERA I] and May 12, 2015 [OPERA II]) and June 30, 2016, 5 additional cases of neoplasm (2 cases of breast cancer, 2 cases of basal-cell skin carcinoma, and 1 case of malignant melanoma) were observed during the OL extensi on phase in which all continuing patients received ocrelizumab. o ORATORIO was an event-driven, P hase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCT evaluating the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab (600 mg administered by IV infusion e very 6 months; given as 2- 300 mg infusions 2 weeks apart for each dose) compared wi th placebo in 732 people with P PMS (Montalban et al 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov Web site, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017). Double-blind treatment was administered for a minimum of 5 doses (120 weeks) until the occurrence of ~ 253 events of disability progression in the tria l cohort that was confirmed for at least 12 weeks. The majority of patients (~88%) reported no previous use of DMT s within 2 years of trial entry. The proportion of patients with Gd-enhancing lesion s was similar (27.5% in the oc relizumab group vs 24.7% in the placebo group); however, there was an imbalance in the mean number of Gd-enhanc ing lesions at baseline, with nearly 50% fewer lesions in the placebo gr oup (1.21 vs 0.6) ( FDA Medical and Summary Reviews 2017 ). The percentages of pat ients with 12-week c onfirmed disability p rogression (primary endpoi nt) were 32.9% with vs 39.3% with placebo (HR = 0.76, CI: to 0 .98; relative risk reduc tion of 24%; p = 0.03). The percentages of patients with 24-week CDP (secondary endpoin t) were 0 .98; relative risk reduction of 25%; p = 0.04). Additional secondary endpoints in cluded changes in the timed 25 -foot walk, the total volu me of hyperintense brain lesions on T2-weighted MRI, and brain volume loss. 53 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 9 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The proportion of patients with 20% worsening of the timed 25- foot walk confirmed at 12 weeks was 49% in ocrelizumab-treated patients co mpared to 59% in placebo-treated patients (25% risk reduction). From baseline to Week 120, the total volume of hyperintense br ain lesions on T2-weighted MRI decreased by 3.37% in ocrelizumab-t reated patients and increased by 7.43% in placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). From Weeks 24 to 120, the percent age of brain volume loss was 0.90% with ocrelizumab vs 1.09% with placebo (p = 0.02). Infusion-related reactions, uppe r respiratory tract infections, and oral herpes infections occurred more frequently with ocrelizumab vs placebo. Neoplasms occurred in 2.3% (11/486) of patients treated with oc relizumab vs 0.8% (2/239) of patients who received placebo. Among the ocre lizumab-treated patients that d eveloped neoplasms, there were 4 cases of breast cancer, 3 cases of basal-cell carcinoma, and 1 case in each of the following: endometrial adenocarcinoma, anaplastic histiocytoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. In the placebo group, 1 patient develope d cervical adenocarcinoma in s itu and 1 patient developed basal-cell carcinoma. Between the clinical cutoff date (July 24, 2015) and June 30, 2016, 2 additional cases of neoplasm (1 case of basal-cell skin carcinoma and 1 case of squamous-cell carcinoma ) were detected during the open-label extension phase in which all patients received ocrelizumab. Mayzent (siponimod) The Phase 3 trial, EXPAND r andomized, paral lel-group, placebo-controll ed, time-to-event study in patients with SPMS w ho had evidence of disability progression in the previous 2 years ( Bar-Or et al 2018, Fox et al 2015, Kappos et al 2018 ). o A total of 1651 patients were r andomized to treatment with eith er siponimod 2 mg (n = 1105) or placebo (n = 546). o A total of 82% of the siponimod- treated patients and 78% of placebo-treated patients co mpleted the study. The median age of patients was 49.0 years, 95% of patients were white, and 60% were female. For the primary endpoint, 288 (26% ) of 1096 patients receiving siponimod and 173 (32%) o f 545 patients receiving placebo had a 3-month CDP (HR 0.79: 95% CI: 21%; = 0.013). Key secondary endpoints included time to 3-month confirmed wors ening of at least 20% from baseline in T25FW and change from baseline in T2 lesi on volume on MRI. Siponimod did not show a significant difference in T25FW. Patients treated with siponimod had a 55% relative reduction in ARR (0.071 vs 0.16), compar ed to placebo (nominal p < 0.01). The absolut e reduction in the ARR was 0.089 with sip onimod. Mavenclad (cladribine) The 96-week a double-blind, 3-arm, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral cladribine in 1326 patients with RR MS ( Giovannoni et al 2010 , Giovannoni 2017 ). o Patients were required to have at least 1 relapse in the previo us 12 months. The median patient age was 39 years and the female-to-male ratio was 2:1. The mean duration of MS p rior to study reenro llment was 8.7 years. o Patients were randomized to recei ve either placebo (n = 437), o r a cumulative oral dose of c ladribine 3.5 mg/kg (n = 433) or 5.25 mg/kg (n = 456) over the 96-week study period in 2 treatment courses. o The primary outcome was ARR. o ARRs at 96 weeks were reduced in both cladribine treatment grou ps vs placebo (0.14, 0.15, and 0.33 in the 3.5 mg/kg, 5.25 mg/kg and placebo gr oups, respectivel y; each p < 0. 001). o A significantly higher percentage of patients remained relapse- free at 96 weeks both in the cladribine treatment groups vs placebo; a total of 79.7% and 78.9% of patients in th e 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/k g groups, respectively, were relapse free vs 60.9% in the placebo group (each p < 0.001 vs placebo). o Cladribine 3.5 mg/kg signific antly lowered the ARR vs the 5.25 mg/kg treatment group. Symptomatic MS Despite the demonstrated effica cy of DMTs, for many patients th ere is little evidence of their effect on quality of life (QOL) in general or symptom m anagement in particular. Impaired mobility contributes to dir ect and indirect costs (Miravelle et al 2011) . o Ampyra (dalfampridine) is the only FDA-approved agent for the symptomatic treatment of i mpaired mobility in patients with MS. Improvement o f walking ability with dalfampridine was demonstrated in two 14-week, double-blind, Phase 3, RCTs of 540 patients of all MS types. Compared to plac ebo, dalfampridine significantly improved the 54 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 10 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

To ad dress the benefit of long-term therapy with dalfampridine, an open-label, obser vational study of 52 MS pati ents with impaired mobility was conduct ed. Results demonstrated that about 60% of patients were still on treatment after 9 to 12 months. Two weeks after treatment initiation, significant ameliorations could be found for T25FW, maximum walking distance, as well as motoric and cognitive fatigue, which persi sted after 9 to 12 months (Ruck et al 2014) . Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) Avonex (IFN-1a IM) and Betaser on (IFN-1b) are FDA-approved fo r the treatment of the first c linical episode with MRI features consistent with MS. C opaxone (glatiramer acetate) and Aubagio (teriflunomide) hav e evidence supporting a significant delay in the time to development of a second exacer bation, compared to placebo, in patients with an isolated demyelinating event. In the PRECISE trial, glatirame r acetate significantly reduced the risk of converting to a CDMS diagnosis by 45% compared to placebo in patients with CIS (p = 0.005). In additi on, the time for 25% of patients to convert to CDMS was significantly prolonged with gla tiramer acetate compared to pla cebo (722 vs 336 days; p = 0.0041) (Comi et al 2009) . In the 2 year, open-label extension phase of PRECISE, early initia tion of glatiramer acetate demonstrated a 41% reduced risk to 0.8; p 0 .0005). Over the 2 year extension, the baseline-adjusted proportions of patients who de veloped CDMS were 29.4% and 46.5% for the early and late initiation treatment groups (odds ratio [OR]: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.7; . A meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with CIS fo und a significantly lower risk of CDMS with IFN therapy compa red to placebo (p < (Clerico et al 2008) . A 10-year, multicenter, randomized clinical trial with IFN-1a IM demonstrated that immediate initiation of therapy in patients wi th CIS reduced the risk for relapses over 10 years, but it was not associated with improved disability outcomes compared to a control group that also initiated therapy relati vely early in the disease (Kinkel et al 2012) . Over the 10-year study , the drop-out rate was significant. Similar results were observed with IFN-1b (BENEFI T study) over an 8-year obs ervation period. Patients who received treatment early had a lower overall ARR compared t o those patients who delayed treatment (Kappos et al 2007, Edan et al 2014) . In the first 3 years of BENEFIT, early treatment with IFN-1b reduced the risk for progression of disability by 40% compared to delayed treatment (16% vs 25%, re spectively; HR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0 .39 to 0.92; p = 0.022). A 2018 systematic revie w and network meta-analysis of RCTs was conducted to assess the pot ential short- and long- term benefits of treatment with IF N- or glatiramer acetate in patients with CIS (Armoiry et al 2018) . The review identified 5 primary RCTs that a ssessed the time to clinically definite multiple sclerosis ( CDMS) in patients with CIS treated with IFN- or glatiram er acetate vs placebo. They found that all drugs reduced the time to CDMS when compared with placebo, with a pooled HR of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.44 t o 0.61) and low heterog eneity, and there was no evidence that indicated that 1 a ctive treatment was superior to another when compared indi rectly. The authors noted that there was insufficient infor mation to rate the risk of sel ection bias, 4 of the 5 studi es were at high risk of performance bias, and 1 study w as rated to have a high risk for attrition bias. Four of the tr ials had open-label extension studies performed over 5 to 10 y ears, all of which indicated th at early DMT therapy (rega rdless of agent) led to an increase in time to CDMS when com pared with place bo (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.74; l should be taken with caut ion; however, as all of the op en-label extension arms were at a high risk for attrition bias and had large losses to follow-up noted. The TOPIC study enrolled 618 pat ients with CIS and found terifl unomide 7 and 14 mg doses r educed the risk of relapse defining CDMS compared to placebo (Miller et al 2014) . Teriflunomide 14 mg reduced the risk of conversion to CDMS by 42.6% compared to placebo (HR, 0.574; 95% C 0.379 to 0.869 ; p = 0.0087) whereas teriflunomide 7 mg reduced the conversion to CDMS by 37.2% compared to placebo (HR, 0.628; 95% CI: 0.416 to 0.949; p = 0.0271). Progressive MS Limited treatment options are a vailable for patients with non-a ctive SPMS FDA-approved for treating SPMS, while ocrelizumab has been specifically approved for the treatment of PPMS (and relapsing forms of MS). Mitoxantrone was shown to reduce the clinical relapse rate and disease progression in aggressive RRMS, SPMS, and progressive-relapsing MS (Hartung et al 2002, Krapf et al 2005) . For MRI outcome measures, mitoxantrone was not statistically significantly dif ferent than placebo at month 12 or 24 for the total number of M RI scans with positive Gd 55 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 11 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

However, the basel ine MRI lesion number and characteristics were d ifferent among the groups (Krapf et al 2005) . In 2010, Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology ev aluated all published data i ncluding cohort data for mitoxantrone. Evaluation of efficacy found that mitoxantron e is probably effective in mode stly reducing clinical attack rate, MRI activity, and disease progression. A confirmatory tri al is necessary before widespread adoption of mitoxantrone for DMT for MS can be made in light of the risks o f cardiotoxicity and treat ment-related leukemia (Marriott et al 2010) . The results of studies with the other agents for MS have failed to consistently demonstrate a benefit in progressive forms of MS, and due to being off-label , these uses are not included in Table 2. In the PROMISE tria l, glatiramer acetate was no more effective than placebo in delaying the time to accumula ted disability for patients with PPMS (Wolinsky et al 2007) . The ASCEND trial evaluated nata lizumab in SPMS was found to h ave no significant difference in the rate of confirmed disability progre ssion compared to placebo ( Kapoor et al 2018 ). Several IFN trials in this population have yielded conflicting results (Rizvi et al 2004) . A systematic analysis evaluated 5 clinical trials (N = 3082) of IFN compared to placebo in the treatment of SPMS. In 4 trials with the primary outcome of sustained disability progression at 3 or 6 months, IFN demonst rated no benefit. The risk ratio for sustained progression with IFN was 0.98 (95% CI: was high (I2 = 57%) (La Mantia et al 2013) . Timing of DMT initiation A 2017 systematic review by Merke l et al (2017) evaluated the e ffect imm unotherapies (ie, fingolimod, natalizumab, alemtuzumab) at diffe rent stages of MS. Twelve publications (9 RCTs + 3 obse rvational studies) were identified as reporting informa tion relevant to the outcomes of early vs delayed initiation of high-efficacy DMTs for RRMS. A number of these studies s uggested that earlier commencement of high-efficacy D MTs resulted in more effective control of relapse act ivity than their later initiati on. The evidence regarding the effect of the timing of high- efficacy therapies on disabilit y outcomes was conflicting; addi tional data are required to answer this question. Decisions to discontinue DMTs in MS Patient with RRMS eventually progress to SPMS. Patients experience worsening dis ability with or without relapses. Current therapies focus on relap sing forms of MS and are not in dicated for non-active SPMS. The decision to discontinue DMTs has not been well studied. The Agency for Heal thcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a comparative effectiveness review evaluating the decision dilemm as surrounding discontinuati on of MS therapies in the setting of progressive disease and pregnancy (Butler et al 2015) . No studies directly assess continued therapy vs discontinued therapy for MS in comparable populations. Based on low strength of evidence, long- term all-cause survival is higher for treatment-na\u00efve M S patients who did not delay sta rting IFN-1b by 2 years and used DMT for a longer duration than those who delayed therapy. Very little evidence i s available about t he benefits and risks o f discontinuation of therapy for MS in women who desire pregnancy (Rae-Grant et al 2018[b] ). Meta-Analyses A 2017 systematic review conducted by the Institute for Clinica l and Economic Review (ICER) included ocrelizumab in a comparative efficacy analysis with other DMTs used in the treat ment of MS. o Network meta-analyses demonstr ated that for the treatment of RRMS, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and ocrelizumab (in that order) were the most e ffective DMTs for reducing ARRs (~70% reduction vs placebo). o Ocrelizumab and alemtuzumab had the greatest reductions in disa bility progression (53% to 58% reduction vs placebo, respectively), closely fo llowed by natalizumab (44%). A systematic review that ident ified 28 RCTs found that the magn itude of ARR reduction vari ed between 15 to 36% for all IFN products, glatiramer acet ate, and teriflunomide; alemtuzum ab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and natalizumab. The risk of 3-month disability pro gression was reduced by 19 to 28% with IFN products, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, et al 2016) . RCTs (n = 39) evaluating 1 of 15 treatments for MS were analyze d for benefits and acceptabili ty in 25,113 patients with RRMS (Tramacere et al 2015) . Drugs included were mab and laquinimod, were also included.

The network meta-analysis evaluated the recurrence of relapses and disability progression. o Relapses: alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, and fingolimod were reported to have greater treatment benefit compared to placebo. Over 12 mont hs (29 studies; N = 17,897): alemtuzumab: RR = .20 to RR = 0.56, quality evid ence RR = 0.63, ality evidence 0.79, uality evidence Relapses over 24 months vs plac ebo (26 studies; 0.47, 95% CI: 0 .27 to 0.81; very low quality evidence natalizumab: RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0. 47 to = 0.72, 0. 64 to 0.81; moderate quality e vidence o Disability worsening over 24 months vs placebo (26 studies; N = 16,800): mitoxantrone: RR = 0.20, = 95% 0 .26 = 0.64, moderate quality evidence o Relapses and disabilit y worsening over 36 months were only tested in 2 studies (CombiRx and CAMMS223). Both studies had a high risk of bias. o Acceptability: Higher rates of withdrawal due to adverse events compared to placebo over 12 months were reported for teriflunomide (RR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.5 CI: 2.5 9 to 9); and fingolimod (R R = 8.26, 95% CI: 3.25 to 20.97). o Over 24 months, only fingolimod had a significantly higher prop ortion of participants who withdrew due to any adverse event (RR vs placebo = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.32 to 2.17). to 1.61 Filippini et al (2013) conducted a Cochrane review of 44 RCTs o n the relative effectiveness and acceptability of DMTs and immunosuppressants in patients with either RRMS or progress ive MS (N = 17,401). o On the basis of high quality evi dence, natalizumab and Rebif we re superior to all other tr eatments for preventing clinical relapses in the short-te rm (24 months) in RRMS compared to placebo (OR = 0.32, 9 5% CI: 0.24 to 0.43; OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.71, res pectively); they were also mor e effective than Avonex (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.36; OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0. 06 to 0.6, respectively). o Based on moderate quality evidence, natalizumab and Rebif decre ased the odds of patients with RRMS having disability progressio n in the short-term, with an absolute redu ction of 14% and 10%, vs placebo. o Natalizumab and Betaseron more 0 .78; OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.7, respectively) than Avonex in reducing the number o f patients with RRMS who h ad progression at 2 years of follow-up, and confidence in th is result was graded as moder ate. o The lack of convincing efficacy data showed that Avonex, IV imm unoglobulins (IVIG), cyclophosphamide, and long- term corticosteroids have an unfavorable benefit-risk balance i n RRMS. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH ) conducted a systematic review of 30 RCTs to assess the comparativ e clinical- and cost-effectiveness of drug therapies for the treatment of RRMS (N,= 16,998) (CADTH, 2013). Results suggested that all acti ve treatments produce statistic ally significant reductions in ARR compared with no treatment, and t hat there were clear between-t reatment differences. o Compared with no treatment, reductions in the ARR were approxim ately 70% for natalizum ab IFNs, acetate, or teriflunomide. o Among active ARRs wer e lower 0.63) compared addition, ARRs were statistically lower for 0.62 to 0.93) compar ed with glatiramer acetate. 57 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 13 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Compared wi th glatiramer acetate, Tecfidera resulted in a lower mean number of T2 lesions, but th e mean number of Gd-enhancing lesions was not statistically different bet ween these 2 treatments. o The incidence of serious adverse events and treatment discontinuations did not differ significantly between treatments in the majority of tr ials, except for a higher incidence of treatment discontinuation for Rebif compared to placebo and alemtuzumab. Hamidi et al (2018) conducted a sy stematic review and network meta-analysis of 37 studies including 26 RCTs from a health technology assessment (HTA) report and 11 supplemental RCTs published after t he HTA. Eleven agents, including alemtuzumab were included and were compared to either placebo o r any drug treatment in pati ents of varying treatment experience levels. Key findings fr om the network meta-analysis include: o Alemtuzumab 12 mg had the highest probability of preventing ann ual relapses (RR = 0.29, 9 5% CI: 0.23 to 0.35; high quality evidence). o Alemtuzumab 24 mg (RR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.7; low quality evidence) mg (RR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.60; very low qu ality evidence) were the most effective against progr ession of disability. o Dimethyl fumarate 240 mg and fingo limod 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg were more effective treatments when considering annual relapse and disability progression: Annual relapse: Dimethyl fumarate 0.42 to 0.6; 0.45, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.71, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.90; high qual ity evidence o Withdrawal due to adverse event s was difficult to assess due to the low quality of available evidence, however, the authors determined that: Fingolimod 1.25 mg (RR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.42 to 2.5; moderate qu ality f 44 mcg (RR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.29 to 3.97; low quality evidence) were associated wit h higher withdrawals due to adverse events when compared with other treatment options. o Alemtuzumab 24 mg (mean differe nce = -0.91; 95% CI: -1.48 to -0 .40), 12 difference = -0.6; 95% CI: -1.02 to -0.24) were more effective than other therapies in low ering the EDSS. o No treatments were found to significantly increase serious adve rse events; peginterferon - 1a was associated with more adverse events overall w hen compared with other medication s (RR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.21 to 2.28). o None of the 11 agents studied were a ssociated with a statistica lly significantly higher risk of mortality when compared to placebo. A Bayesian network meta-analysis e valuating DMTs for RRMS ranke d most effective therapies based on SUCRA analysis ( Lucchetta et al 2018 ). A total of 33 studies were included in the analysis. For the ARR, alemtuzumab (96% probability), natalizumab (96%), and ocrelizumab (85%) be most effective therapies (high-quality evidence). A meta-analysis of randomized c ontrolled trials was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of teriflunomide in reducing the frequency of relapse s and progression of physical disability in patients with r elapsing multiple sclerosis ( Xu et al 2016 ). The results showed that teriflunomide (7 and 14 mg) reduced the ARR and teriflunomide 14 mg decreased the disability progre ssion in comparison to placebo (RR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.87). 58 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 14 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CLINICAL GUIDELINES The European Committee for Resear ch and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) published updated guidelines in 2018 ( Montalban et al 2018 ). The main recommendations reported were the following: o The entire spectrum of disease-modifying drugs should be prescr ibed only in centers with adequate infrastructure to provide proper monitoring of pat ients, comprehensive assessment , detection of side effect s, and capacity to address them properly. (Consensus statement) o Offer IFN or glatiramer acetate to patients with CIS and abnorm al MRI findings with lesions suggesting MS who do not fulfill full criteria for MS. (Strong) o Offer early treatment with diseas e-modifying drugs in patients with active RRMS, as defined by clinical relapses and/or MRI activity (active lesi ons: contrast-enhancing lesions; new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions assessed at least annually). (Strong) o For active RRMS, choosing among the wide range of available dru gs from the modestly effective to the highly effective will depend on patient c haracteristics and comorbidit y, disease severity/activit y, drug safety profile, and accessibility of the drug . (Consensus statement) o Consider treatment with IFN in patients with active SPMS, takin g into account, in discussion with the patient, the dubious efficacy, as well as saf ety and tolerability profile. ( Weak) o Consider treatment with mitoxantrone in patients with active SPMS, taking into account the efficacy and specifically the safety and tolerability profile of this agent. (Weak) o Consider ocrelizumab for pati ents with active SPMS. (Weak) o Consider ocrelizumab for patients with PPMS. (Weak) o Always consult the summary of pr oduct characteristics for dosag e, special warnings, and precautions of use, contraindications, and monitori ng of side effects and potential harms. (Consensus statement) o Consider combining MRI with clin ical measures when evaluating d isease evolution in treated patients. (Weak) o When monitoring treatment respons e in patients treated with dis ease-modifying drugs, perform standardized reference brain MRI within 6 months of treatment onset and comp are the results with thos e of further brain MRI, typically performed 12 months after starting treatment. Adjust the timing of both MRIs, taki ng into account the drug's mechanism and speed of action and disease activity, including clinical and MRI measures. (Consensus statement) o When monitoring treatment respons e in patients treated with dis ease-modifying drugs, the measurement of new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesio ns is the preferred MRI method, supplemented by Gd-enhancing lesions for monitoring treatment response. E valuation of these parameters r equires high-quality standardized MRI scans and interpretation by highly qualifi ed readers with experience in M S. (Consensus statement) o When monitoring treatment safety in patients treated with disea se-modifying drugs, perform standard reference MRI every year in patients at low risk for PML, and more frequently (3 to 6 months) in patient s at high risk for PML (JC virus positivity, natalizumab tr eatment duration over 18 months ) and in patients at high ri sk for PML who switch drugs at the time the current treatmen t is discontinued and the new t reatment is started. (Consensus statement) o Offer a more efficacious drug to patients treated with IFN or g latiramer acetate who show evidence of disease activity, assessed as recommended above. (Strong) o When deciding on which drug to s witch to, in consultation with the patient, consider pati ent characteristics and comorbidities, drug safety profile, and disease severity/activi ty. (Consensus statement) o When treatment with a highly efficacious drug is stopped, wheth er due to inefficacy or safety, consider starting another highly effica cious drug. When star ting the new drug, ta ke into account disease act ivity (clinical and MRI; the greater the disease activity, the greater the urgency to start new treatment), the half-life and biological activity of the previous drug, and the potential for resumed disease activity o r even rebound (particularl y with natalizumab). (Consensus statement) o In treatment decisions, consider the possibility of resumed disease activity or even rebo und when stopping treatment, particularly with natalizumab. (Weak) o Consider continuing a disease-mo difying drug if the patient is stable (clinically and on MR I) and shows no safety or tolerability issues. (Weak) o Advise all women of childbearin g potential that disease-modifyi ng drugs are not licensed during pregnancy, except glatiramer acetate 20 mg/m L.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. o For women planning a pregnancy, if there is a high risk for disease reactivation, consider using IFN or glatiramer acetate until pregnancy is confir med. In some very specific (ac tive) cases, continuing this treatment during pregnancy could also be considered. (Weak) o For women with persistent high disease activity, it would gener ally be advised to delay pre gnancy. For those who still decide to become pregnant or have an unplanned pregnancy, treat ment with natalizumab throughout pregnancy may be considered after full discussi on of potential implications; or treatment with alemtuzumab could be an alternative for planned pregnancy in ve ry active cases provided that a 4-month interval is strictly observe d from the latest infusion until conception. (Weak) The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) performed a systematic review that included 20 Cochrane reviews and 73 additional articles in order to assess the avail able evidence on initiation, switching, and st opping DMTs in patients with MS ( Rae Grant et al 2018[a]) . The results of the systematic review were used to assist in f ormulating updated AAN treatment guidelines (Rae Grant et al 2018[b]) . The main recommendations were as follows: o Starting DMT Clinicians should discuss the benets and risks of DMTs for peo ple with a single clinical demyelinating event with 2 or more brain lesions that have imaging characteristics consistent with MS (Level B). After discussing the risks and benets, clinicians should prescr ibe DMTs to people with a single clinical demyelinating event and 2 or more brain lesions characteristic of MS w ho decide they want this therapy. (Level B) Clinicians should offer DMTs to people with relapsing forms of MS with recent clinical re lapses or MRI activity. (Level B) Clinicians should monitor the re productive plans of women with MS and counsel regarding reproductive risks and use of birth control during DMT use in women of childbearing po tential who have MS. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel men with MS on their reproductive pla ns regarding treatment implications before initiating treatment with teriflunomide. (Level B) Because of the high frequency o f severe adverse events, clinici ans should not prescribe mitoxantrone to people with MS unless the potential t herapeutic benets greatly outwei gh the risks. (Level B) Clinicians should prescribe alem tuzumab, ngolimod, or natalizumab for people with highly active MS. (Level B) Clinicians may initiate natalizumab treatment in people with MS with positive anti-JCV ant ibody indices above 0.9 only when there is a reasonable chance of benet compared with the low but serious r isk of PML. (Level C) Clinicians should offer ocreliz umab to people with PPMS who are likely to benet from this therapy unless there are risks of treatment that outwe igh the benets. (Level B) o Switching DMTs Clinicians should discuss switch ing from one DMT to another in people with MS who have been using a DMT long enough for the treatment to take full effect and are adherent t o their therapy when they experience 1 or more relapses, 2 or more unequivocally new MRI-detected lesions, or increased disabilit y on examination, over a 1-year period of using a DMT. (Level B) Clinicians should evaluate the degree of disease activity, adherence, adverse event proles, and mechanism of action of DMTs when switching DM Ts in people with MS with break through disease activity during DMT use. (Level B) Clinicians should discuss a change to non-injectable or less frequently injected DMTs in people with MS who report intolerable discomfort with the injections or in those who repo rt injection fatigue on injectable DMTs. (Level B) Clinicians should inquire abou t medication adverse events with people with MS who are ta king a DMT and attempt to manage these adverse events, as appropriate (Level B). Clini cians should discuss a medication switch with people with MS for whom these adver se events negatively influence adherence. (Level B) Clinicians should monitor labor atory abnormalities found on req uisite laboratory surveillance (as outlined in the medication's package insert) in people with MS who are using a DMT (Level B). Clinicians s hould discuss switching DMTs or reducing dosage or frequen cy (where there are data on d ifferent doses [eg, int erferons, teriflunomide]) when there are persistent laboratory abnormalities. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel people with MS considering natalizuma b, ngolimod, ocrelizumab, and dimethyl fumarate about the PML risk associated with these agents (Level B). Clin icians should discuss switching to a DMT with a lower PML risk with people with M S taking natalizumab who are o r who become JCV antibody-positive, especially with an index of above 0.9 while on therapy. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel tha t new DMTs without long-term safet y data have an undened risk of malignancy and infection for people with MS star ting or using new DMTs (Level B).

People with MS with serious infections potentially linked to their DMTs should switch DMTs (does not pertain to PML management in people with MS using DMT). (Level B) Clinicians should check for natalizumab antibodies in people wi th MS who have infusion reactions before subsequent infusions, or in peopl e with MS who experience breakthrough disease activity with natalizumab use (Level B). Clinicians should swi tch DMTs in people with MS who have persistent natalizum ab antibodies. (Level B) Physicians must counsel people with MS considering natalizumab discontinuation that there is an increased risk of MS relapse or MRI-detected disease activity within 6 months of discontinuation (Level A ). Physicians and people with MS choosing to switch from natalizumab to ngolimod should initiate treatment within 8 to 12 weeks after natalizumab discontinuation (for reasons other than pregnancy o r pregnancy planning) to d iminish the return of disease activity. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel women to stop their DMT before concep tion for planned pregnanci es unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DMT during pregnancy (Level B). Clinicians should discontinue DMTs during pregnancy if accidental exposure occurs, unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DMT during pregnancy (Level B). Clinicians should not initiate DMTs during pregnancy unless the risk of MS activity during pregnan cy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DM T during pregnancy. (Level B) o Stopping DMTs In people with RRMS who are stab le on DMT and want to discontin ue therapy, clinicians should counsel people regarding the need for ongoing follow-up and periodic reevaluat ion of the decision to discontinue DMT (Level B). Clinicians should advocate tha t people with MS who are stable ( that is, those with no relapses, no disability progression, and stable imaging ) on DMT should continue their c urrent DMT unless the patient and physician decide a trial off therapy is warranted. (Level B) Clinicians should as sess the likelihood of future relapse in individuals with SPMS by assessing patient age, disease duration, relapse history, and MRI-detected activity (eg, frequ ency, severity, time since most recent relapse or gadolinium-enhanced lesion) (Level B). Clinicians may advise discontinuation of DMT in people with SPMS who do not have ongoing relapses (or ga dolinium enhanced lesions on MR I activity) and have not been ambulatory (EDSS 7 or greater) for at l east 2 years. (Level C) Clinicians should review the as sociated risks of continuing DMT s vs those of stopping DM Ts in people with CIS using DMTs who have not been di agnosed with MS. (Level B) According to the 2013 Canadian recommendations for treatment of MS, treatment decisions should be based on the level of concern for the rate and severity of relapses, degree of functional impairment due to relapses and disability progression. First-line treatment recommendations for RRMS incl ude IFN products and acetate. Second-line therapies for RRMS include fingolimod and natalizumab (Freedman et al 2013) . With an increasing number of options for the treatment of RRMS, the place in therapy for an individual agent is not straightforward. Treatment dec isions will likel y be based on a consideration of the risks a nd benefits of each therapy, physician experience, patient com orbidities, and patient prefer ences. The 2015 AAN position statement supports access to all DMT for patients with MS. In addition, step therapy should be driven by evidence-ba sed clinical and safety information and not just based on costs. Highly individualized treatment decisions are neces sary for patients with MS according to the AAN (Corboy et al 2015) . The 2015 Association of British N eurologists state that all available DMTs are effective in reducing relapse rate and MRI lesion accumulation (Scolding et al 2015) . Evidence is less clear on the impact of DMT on long-term disa bility. Drugs are separated into 2 categories based on relative efficacy. Categor y 1 - moderate efficacy include s IFNs glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, - high efficacy includes alemtuzumab and natalizumab - these drugs s hould be reserved for patients w ith very active MS. In September 2018, the MS Coalition published an update to its consensus paper on the prin ciples and current evidence concerning the use of DMTs in MS. Major recommendations include d the following: o Initiation of treatment with an FD A-approved DMT is recommended as soon as possible following a diagnosis of relapsing or primary progressi ve MS, regardless of the person's age; for individuals with a first clinical event and MRI features consistent with MS in whom other possible causes have been excluded; and for individuals with progressive MS who continue to demonstrate c linical relapses and/or demonst rate inflammatory activity. o Clinicians should co nsider prescribing a high efficacy medicati on such as alemtuzumab, fi ngolimod, ocrelizumab or natalizumab for newly-diagnosed individuals with highly active MS. 61 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 17 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. o Treatment with a given DMT shoul d be continued indefinitely unless any of the following oc cur (in which case an alternative DMT should be considered): Suboptimal treatment response as determined by the individual a nd his or her treating clinician Intolerable side effects Inadequate adherence to the treatment regimen Availability of a more appr opriate treatment option The healthcare provide r and patient deter mine that the benefits no longer outweigh the risks. o Movement from one DMT to another should occur only for medicall y appropriate reasons as determined by the treating clinician and patient. o When evidence of additional clinical or MRI activity while on t reatment suggests a sub-optimal response, an alternative regimen (eg, differ ent mechanism of action) should be considered to optimize therapeutic benefit. o Due to significant v ariability in the MS p opulation, people wit h MS and their treating clinicians require access to the full range of treatment optio ns for several reasons: Different mechanisms of action allow for treatment change in th e event of a sub-optimal response. Potential contraindications limit options for some individuals. Risk tolerance varies among people with MS and their treating c linicians. Route of delivery, frequency of dosing, and side effects may af fect adherence and quality of life. Individual differences related to tolerability and adherence ma y necessitate access to different medications within the same class. Pregnancy and breastfeeding lim it the available options. o Individuals' access to treatment s hould not be limited by their frequency of relapses , level of disability, or personal characteristics such as age, sex, or ethnicity. o Absence of relapses while on tr eatment is a characteristic of t reatment effectiveness and should not be considered a justification for discontinuation of treatment. SAFETY SUMMARY Warnings for IFN include decreased peripheral blood cell count s including leukopenia, higher rates of depression, suicide and psychotic disorders , injection site reactions, and risk of severe hepatic injury. IFN (Avonex, Rebif, Betaseron, Extavia, and Plegridy) is with influenza- like symptoms including injection site reactions, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and headache. All IFN products carry a warning for thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocyt openic purpura and hemolytic ure mic syndrome. Adverse events related to IFN therapy appear to be dose-related and transient. Glatiramer acetate is contraindi cated in patients known hy persensitivity to glatiramer ac etate or mannitol. Patients treated with glatirame r acetate may experience a transient, self-limited, post-injection reac tion of flushing, chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, constriction of th e throat, and urticaria following injection. Injection site reactions incl uding lipodystrophy and skin necrosis have been reported. Because glatiramer acetate can modify immune response, it may int erfere with immune functions. In controlled studies of glati ramer acetate 20 mg/mL, the most common adverse reactions ( 10% and 1.5 times higher than placebo) were injection site reactions, vasodilatation, rash , dyspnea, and chest pain. In a controlled study of glatiramer acetate 40 mg/mL, the most common adverse reactions ( 10% and 1.5 times higher than placebo) w ere injection site reactions. Fingolimod was originally approved with a risk evaluation and m itigation strategies program (REMS) to inform healthcare providers about the serious risks including bradyarrhythmia, at rioventricular block, inf ections, macular od pressure, basal cell carc inoma, immune system effects following discontinuation, and hypersensitivity r eactions; howe ver, the FDA lifted the REMS requirements in November 2016. Posterior Reversible Enceph alopathy Syndrome (PRES) has b een reported with fingolimod. Patients with pre- existing cardiac disease may poorly tolerate fingolimod and may require additional monitoring. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence 10% and > placebo) were headache, liver transaminas e elevation, diarrhea, cough, influenza, sinusitis, back pain, abdominal pain, and pain in extremity. If a serious infection develops, consider suspending fingolimod and reassess risks and benefits prior to re-initiation. Elimination ma y take up to 2 months thus, monitoring for infections shoul d continue during this time. Do not start fingolimod in patients wi th active acute or chronic infection until the infection is resolved. Life-threatening and fatal infections have been reported in patients taking fingolimod. Establish immunity to v aricella zoster virus prior to therapy initiation. Recent safety labeling changes warn of an increased risk of cutaneous malignancies, including melanoma , in patients treated with fingolimod. Cases of PML 62 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 18 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A warning for PML has been adde d to the fingolimod labeling; at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, fingolimod should be withheld and an appropriate diagn ostic evaluation performed. Mo nitoring for signs consistent with PML on MRI may be useful to allow for an early diagnosis. Additionally, severe increases in disability after disc ontinuation of fingolimod have been described in post marketing reports. Teriflunomide is contraindicat ed in patients with severe hepatic impairment; patients who are pregnant, of childbearing potential, or that are not using reliable contraception; and wi th concurrent use of leflunomide. Labeling includes boxed warnings regarding hepatotoxicit y and teratogenicity/embryolethality that occurred in animal reproduction studies in multiple animal species at plasma teriflunomide exposures simil ar to or lower than in human s. Other warnings include risk of leukopenia, peripheral neuropathy, severe skin reaction s, and elevated blood pressure. Teriflunomide has a half- life of 4 to 5 months; therefore, use of activated charcoal or cholestyramine in an 11-day r egimen upon discontinuation of teriflunomide is recommended to reduce serum levels over 2 w eeks. The most common adverse reactions ( 10% and 2% greater than placebo) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, and an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Dimethyl fumarate has no contraindications, except in with hypersensitivity to d imethyl fumarate or any excipients. Warnings include ana phylaxis and angioedema, PML, l ymphopenia, and clinically significant cases of liver injury reported in the post-market ing setting. Consider therapy interruption if severe lymphopenia for more than 6 months occurs. Cases of PML hav e been reported following dimeth yl fumarate therapy. Monitoring for signs consistent with PML on MRI may be useful to allow for an early diagnosis. Common adverse events (incidence 10% and 2% more than placebo) were flushing , abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. Administration of non -enteric aspirin up to 325 mg given 30 minutes prior to each dose or temporary dose reduct ion to 120 mg twice daily may reduce flushing. Natalizumab has a boxed warning regarding the risk of PML. PML is an opportunistic viral i nfection of the brain that usually leads to death or severe disability. Due to the risk of PML, natalizumab is only a vailable through the TOUCH\u00ae Prescribing Program which is a r estricted distribution program. Natalizumab is contraindicated in patients who have or have had PML and in pat ients who have had a hypersensitivity re action. The most common adverse reactions (incidence 10%) we re headache, fatigue, art hralgia, urinary t ract infection, lower res piratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, vaginitis, depression, pain in extremity, abdominal discomfort hypersensitivity reaction to natalizumab. Monitoring for signs consisten t with PML on MRI may be useful t o allow for an early diagnosi s. Other warnings with natalizumab include hypersensitivity reactions, increased risk of Herpes encephalitis and meningitis, acute retinal necrosis, increased ri sk of infections (including opportunistic infections), and hepatotoxicity, diarrhea (not otherwise specified), and rash. Mitoxantrone has boxed warnings for the risk of cardiotoxicity, risk of bone marrow suppression, and secondary leukemia. Congestive heart failure (CHF), potentially fatal, ma y occur either during therap y with mitoxantrone or months to years after termination of t herapy. The maximum cumulative lifetime dose of mitoxantrone for MS patients should not exceed 140 mg/kg/m2. Monitoring of cardiac function is required prior to all mitox antrone doses. Alemtuzumab is contraindicated in patients with human immunodef iciency virus (HIV). The boxed warning for alemtuzumab includes autoimmunity conditions (immune thrombocyt openia and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease), serious and life-threat ening infusion reactions, seri ous and life-threatening stroke within 3 days of administration, and the possibility of an increased risk of malignancies. Alemtuzumab is only available through a restricted distribution and REMS program which requires the mem ber, provider, pharmacy and infusion facility to be certified by the REMS program. A pproximately one-third of patie nts who receive alemtuzumab develop thyroid disorders. The most commonly reported adverse events reported i n at least 10% of alemtuz umab-treated patients and more frequently than with IFN-1a were rash, headache, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, nausea, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, upper respirat ory tract infection, herpes vi ral infection, urticaria, pruri tus, thyroid disorders, fungal infection, arthralgia, pain in extremity, back pain, diarrhea, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, paresthesia, dizziness, abdominal pain, flushing, and vomiting. Nearly all patients (99 .9%) in clinical trials had lymphopenia following a treatment course of alemtuzumab . Alemtuzumab may also increase the risk of acute acalculous cholecystitis; in controlled clinical studies, 0.2% of alemtuzumab-treated MS patients developed acute acalculous cholecystitis, compared to 0% of patients treated with IFN-1a. During postmar keting use, additional cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis have been report ed in alemtuzumab-treated patient s. Recent updates to the sa fety labeling include a warning that patients taking ale mtuzumab are at risk for seriou s infections caused by Listeria monocytogenes . Patients that are prescribed alemtuzumab should be counseled about this risk, and to avoid or appropriately heat any foods that may be a source of Listeria , such as deli meats and unpasteurized cheeses. Patients should undergo tuberculosis screening according to local guidelines. 63 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 19 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The labeling of ocrelizumab doe s not contain any boxed warnings ; however, ocrelizumab is contraindicated in patients with active hepatitis B virus ( HBV) infection and in those with a history of life-threateni ng infusion reactions to ocrelizumab. Additional warnings for ocrelizumab concern infusi on reactions, infections, and an increased risk of malignancies. o As of June 30, 2016, the overall incidence rate of first neoplasm among ocrelizumab-treat ed patients across all 3 pivotal studies and a Phase 2, dose-finding study (Kappos et al [2011]) was 0.40 per 100 patient-years of exposure to ocrelizumab (6467 patient-year s of exposure) vs 0.20 per 100 patient-years of exposure in the pooled comparator groups (2053 patient-years of ex posure in groups receiving Rebi f or placebo) (Hauser et al 2017, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017) . Since breast cancer occurred in 6 out of 781 females treated with ocrelizumab (vs in none of 668 females treated with Rebif or placebo), the labeling of ocrelizumab additionall y recommends that patient s follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines. In related postmarketing require ments, the FDA has asked the manufacturer to conduct a prospective, longitudinal, observational study in adult pat ients with RMS and PPMS exposed to ocrelizumab to determine the incidence and mortality rates of breast cance r and all malignancies. All patients enrolled in the study need to be followed for a minimum of 5 years or until death following their first exposur e to ocrelizumab and the protocol must specify 2 appropriate populations to which t he observed incidence and mor tality rates will be compared (FDA approval letter 2017) . o No cases of PML have been report ed to date in any studies of oc relizumab ( Hauser et al 2017, McGinley al 2017, Ocrevus Fo rmulary Submission Dossier 2017 ). o In patients with RMS, the most c ommon adverse reactions with oc relizumab (incidence 10% and greater than Rebif) were upper respiratory tr act infections and infusion rea ctions. In patients with PPMS, the most common adverse reactions (incidence 10% and greater than placebo) we re upper respiratory tract infections, infusion reactions, skin infections, and lower respiratory tract infecti ons. Dalfampridine is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure, moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl 50 mL/min), and a history of hypersensitivity to dalfampridine or 4-aminopyridine. Dalfampridi ne can cause anaphylaxis; signs and symptoms of anaphylaxi s have included respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and or tongue. Urinary tract infection s (UTIs) were reported more f requently as adverse reactions in controlled studies in patients receiving dalfampridine 10 mg twice daily (12%) as com pared to placebo (8%). The most common adverse events (incidence 2% and at a rate greater than the placebo r ate) for dalfampridine were UTI, insomnia, dizziness, headache, nausea, asthenia, back pain, balance disorder, MS relapse, 2C9*3/*3 genotype, presence of Mobitz type II second- degree, third degree atrioventricula r (AV) block or sinus syndr ome. It is also contraindicated in patients that have experienced myocardial infarcti on, unstable angina, stroke, tra nsient ischemic attack or d ecompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization in the past 6 months. Warnings and pr ecautions of siponimod include macular edema, increased blood pressure, brady arrhythmia and AV conduction del ays, decline in pulmonary function, and liver injury. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contracept ion during and for 10 days a fter stopping siponimod due to fetal risk. The most adverse events are headache, hypertensi on, and transaminase increases. Cladribine is contraindicated in patients with current malignancy, HIV infection, active chroni c infection such as hepatitis or tuberculosis, hypersensitivit y to cladribine, and in pregnan t women. There is a boxed warning for potential malignancy and risk of teratogenicity. The warn ings and precautions are lymphopenia, active infection, h ematologic toxicity, liver injury, and graft vs host disease with blood transfusion. The m ost common adverse events are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and lymphopenia. Table 3.

CONCLUSION DMTs for MS have shown benefits in patients with RRMS such as a decreased relapse rate and a slower accumulation of brain lesions on MRI. Theref ore, it is recommended that all patients with a diagnosis o f definite RRMS begin DMTs (MS Coalition 2017) . IFN products have been shown to decrease MRI lesion activity, prevent relapses, and delay disease progression. In general, patients treated with IF N or glatiramer acetate can e xpect a 30% reduction in ARR during a 2-year period (MS Coalition 2017) . Head-to-head clinical trials have found IFN and glatiramer a cetate to be compar able in terms of efficacy on relapse rate. Several studies have demonstrated an improved tolerability at the cost of a decreased therapeutic response with the lo w dose IM IFN-1a compared to the higher dose SC IFN-1a (Panitch et al 2002, Panitch et al 2005, Schwid et al 2005, Sc hwid et al 2007, Traboulsee et al 2008) . Influenza-type symptoms, injection site reactions, headache, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain are the m ost frequently reported adver se events with IFN products including Plegridy. Wit h IFN, use caution in patients with depression or other mood disorders. Peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks has demonstr ated efficacy in reducing the AR R in relapsing forms of MS compared to placebo. Potential advantages of Plegridy are less frequent administration every 2 weeks and possibly the reduced risk of NAb development. Adverse effect profile is similar among the IFNs. The most frequently rep orted adverse events with glatiramer ace tate include a transient, sel f-limiting, post-injection systemic reaction immediately following drug administration con sisting of flushing, chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, dyspnea, throat constri ction, and urticaria . Glatiramer acetate does not have any known drug interactions and is not associated with an in creased risk of hepat otoxicity or depressi on. Glatiramer acetate is generically available. Despite advancements in treatme nt, many patients fail initial D MTs with glatiramer acetate or IFN, primarily due to intolerable adverse effects or perceived inadequate efficacy (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . Clinical trials have shown that patients switching fr om IFN to glatiramer acetate therapy and vice versa, due to poor response, may achieve a significant reduction in relapse rates and a delay in disease and disability progression (Coyle 2008, Caon et al 2006, Zwibel 2006) . The guidelines suggest that all first-line MS DMTs should be made accessible, and the choice of initial treatment should be based on patient-specific factors (Corboy et al 2015, MS Coalit ion 2017, Scolding et al 2015, Montalban et al 2018) . Premature discontinuation rate is high among patients with MS ; therefore, fact ors that will maximize adherence should be co nsidered when initiating therapy . Failure with 1 agent does not necessarily predict failure to another. Therefore, patients experiencing an inadequ ate response or drug-induc ed adverse event should be switched to a different DMT (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . There are now 5 available oral a gents: Gilenya (fingolimod), wh ich was approved in 2010, A which was approved 2012, and Tecfidera ( dimethyl fumarate), which was approved in 2013. The 2 new agents are Mavenclad (cladribine) and Mayzent (siponi mod). Among other potential ben efits, it is expected that the availability of oral agents may increase convenience and impr ove patient adherence to their drug regimen (Sanvito et al 2011) . The available oral drugs each have different mechanisms of action and tolerability profiles. The oral products have not been compared to one another in any head-to-head tr ials. Cases of PML have been reported in patients taking to fingolimod, indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of M S, to include CIS, relapsing-r emitting disease, and active secondary progressive 72 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 28 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In a trial comparing Ma yzent to placebo, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of 3-month CDP, delayed the risk of 6-month CDP, and reduced the ARR ( Kappos et al 2018 ). First dose cardiac monitoring is recommended for patients with a heart rate < 55 bpm or a hist ory of cardiac dis ease. Siponimod shares many of the same warnings as fingolimod. Mavenclad (cladribine) is a puri ne antimetabolite indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to include relapsing-remitting disease and ac tive secondary progressive di sease. In a trial comparing Mavenclad to placebo, both Mavenclad 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/k g treatment groups had reduced ARRs and disability progression vs placebo (Giovannoni et al 2010 ). Lymphopenia is the mos t common adverse effect. Gilenya (fingolimod) is a sphing osine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. In a trial comparing fingolimod to placebo, fingolimod-treated patients had a decreased ARR, improved MRI outcomes, and a lower likelihood of disability progression (Kappos et al 2010) . In a trial comparing fingolim od to IFN-1a IM (Avonex), fingolimod-treated patients had a decreased AR R and improved MRI outco mes, but disability p rogression was similar in the 2 groups (Cohen et al, 2010) . The adverse event profile for fingolimod includes cardiovascu lar risks including bradycardia. First dose administration of fingolimod requi res at least 6 h ours of obser vation with hourly monito ring of heart rate and blood pressure, and patients should have an ECG before dosing and at the end of the obse rvation period. Fingolimod is also FDA-approved for MS in the pediatric population. In a trial evaluating patients between 10 and 17 years of age, fingolimod signific antly reduced ARR and the rate or new or newly enlarged lesions compared to IFN- 1a (Chitnis et al 2018 ). Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) efficacy similar to that of f ingolimod; its benefit-risk p rofile makes it a reasonable initial or later stage DMT opti on for most patients with RRMS (CADTH 2013, Wingerchuk et al 2014) . Gastrointestinal intolerance and flushing are co mmon side effects that may wane with time; slow titration to maintenance doses, taking the medication with food, and pr emedication with aspirin may re duce their novo pyrimidine synthesis. Although its exact m echanism of action is unknown, i t may involve a reduction in the number of activated lymphocytes in the CNS. Patients treated with teriflunomide in a clinical trial experience d a reduction in the ARR and improved MRI outcomes compared to placebo. Patients in the high er dose group (14 mg) also had a lower likelihood of disability progression, but this difference was not statistical ly significant in the lo wer dose group (7 mg) (O'Connor et al, 2011) . Teriflunomide has boxed warni ngs for the possibility of sever e liver injury and teratogenicity. The most common adverse reactions inc lude increases in ALT, alopecia, diarrhea, influenza, nausea, and paresthesia. Tysabri (natalizumab) has demonst rated very high efficacy vs placebo and although PM L is a major safety concern, the overall incidence of PML has remained low (0.4%). Natalizumab c an only be obtained through a restricted distribution program. Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a highl y efficacious DMT that has dem onstrated superiority in reducing relapses when compared to Rebif in both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experie nced patients. The dosing schedule of 2 annual treatment courses is counterbalanced by the need for regular mo nitoring of the increased risk for autoimmunity. Lemtrada is best reserved for pat ients who have failed at least 2 other DMTs and are not candidates for natalizumab (Garnock-Jones 2014). is a desi gned to selectively target CD20-positive As a humanized form of Rituxan (rituximab), ocrelizumab is expected to be less immunogenic wi th repeated infusions and may have a more favorable benefit -to-risk profile than Rituxan (Sorensen et al 2016) . o The approval of Ocrevus provides another DMT option to the grow ing armamentarium of highly effective agents indicated for the treatment of R MS. Ocrelizumab is also indicat ed for the treatment of PPMS , making it the first DMT with substantial evidence supporting its use in this form of MS . Although the pivotal studies of ocrelizumab were of sufficient length to assess effica cy, more long-term safety dat a are needed to evaluate the effects of ocrelizumab on emergent neoplasms and the risk of PML. Mitoxantrone is a synthetic inter calating chemotherapeutic agent. While it is approved for the treatment of RRMS, SPMS, and PRMS, cumulative dose-re lated cardiac toxicity and th e risk for secondary leukem ia markedly limit its use. Mitoxantrone is, therefore, reser ved for use in patients with a ggressive disease. While DMTs do not sufficiently address QOL in RRMS, symptomatic agents such as Ampyra (dalfampridine) can be used to complement tr eatment with DMTs. Although a 25% improvement in T25FW may appear marginal, it has been established that improvements in T25FW speed of 20% are meaningful to people with MS. Dalfampridine can complement DMTs, which do not address the specific symptom of w alking speed. Improved walking could potentially contain some of the direct and indirect costs (eg, reduced prod uctivity, disability, unempl oyment, costs of assistive devices and caregivers) associated with MS. 73 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 29 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Therapeutic Class Overview Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Constipation Agents INTRODUCTION Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) IBS is a gastrointestinal disorder that most commonly manifests as chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of any organic disorder ( Wald 2019a ). IBS may consist of diarrhea-predo minant (IBS-D; abnormal BMs ar e usually diarrhea), constipation-predominant (IBS-C; abnormal BMs are usually consti pation), IBS with a mixed sympto matology (IBS-M), or un classified IBS (IBS-U). Switching between the subtypes of IBS is also possible (Ford et al 2018, Wald 2019b ). IBS is a functional disorder of t he gastrointestinal tract char acterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, discomfort and bloating, and abnormal bowel habits with bouts of diarrhea and/ or constipation. The exact pathogenesis of the disorder is unknown; however, it is believ ed that altered gastrointestin al tract motility, visceral hypersensitivity, autonomic dysfunction, and psychological factors indicate disturbances wi thin the enteric nervous s ystem, which controls the gastrointestinal system ( Andresen et al 2008, Ford et al 2009, Quigley et al 2012, World Gast roenterology Organization [WGO] 2015 ). Prevalence estimates of IBS range from 10 to 12%, and it typically occurs in young adulthood ( Ford et al 2018 ). IBS-D is more common in men, and IBS-C is more common in women (WGO 2015 ). Symptoms of IBS often interfere with daily life and social func tioning ( WGO 2015 ). The general goals of therapy in IBS are to alleviate the patien t's symptoms and to target any specific exacerbating factors (eg, medications, dietary changes), concerns about seri ous illness, stressors, or potential psychiatric comorbidities that may exist ( Ford et al 2018 ). Non-pharmacological interventions to combat IBS symptoms includ e dietary modifications such as exclusion of gas- producing foods (eg, beans, prunes, Brussel sprouts, bagels, et c.), and consumption as psychosocial therapies (eg, h ypnosis, biofeedback, etc.) ( Ford et al 2018 ). Depending upon the clinical pres entation of an individual's IBS condition, a number o f therapies exist to help alleviate the constellation of disease sym ptoms. Commonly used agents tha t are often initiated for disease control include selective Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of IBS-C in adu lts. Lubiprostone is indicated in women 18 years of age; tegaserod is indicated for the treatment of IBS-C in adult women < 65 years of age. Tegaserod is a serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4) agonist FDA-approved in July 2002 for the short-term treatment of IBS-C in women and in August 2004 for the treatment of CIC in men and wo men < 65 years of age . In 2007, tega serod was removed from the United States (U.S) market due to safety conce rns based on a postmarketing pooled safety analysis of 29 clinical trials whi ch demonstrated a higher rate of serious cardiovascular events (including angina, myocardial infarction and stroke ) in patients treated with tega serod vs placebo ( FDA Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee 2018, FDA Multi-Disciplinary Review [Zelnorm] 2019 ). In 2018, the FDA Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee evaluated the safety and efficacy of tegaserod and recommended approval of tegaserod for the treatment of female p atients < 65 years of age with IBS-C at a low cardiovascular risk; tegaserod was re-introdu ced March 2019 ( Drugs@FDA 2019; Gastrointestinal Drugs Viberzi (eluxadoline) the treatment of IBS-D. V iberzi is a schedule IV controlled substance. Lotronex (al osetron) is FDA-approved with restrictions for the treat ment of women who exhibit severe IBS-D and have failed conventional therapy. Chronic idiopathic c onstipation (CIC) 84 Data as of August 15, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/ALS Page 2 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients. The contents of the therapeutic class overviews on this website (\"Content\") are for informational purposes only. T he Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when are indicated for the treatment of CIC. Symptoms of con stipation are common with a prevalence of approximatel y 16% in adults overall and 33% in adults >60 years of age. Con stipation is defined as < 3 bowel movements (BMs) per week with symptoms that may include hard stools, a feeling of incomplete evacuation, ab dominal discomfort, bloati ng, and distention. Initial treatment typically includes osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives, and increased fiber intake ( American Gastroenterological Association [AGA] Medical Position Statement 2013, Bharucha et al 2013 ). Prucalopride, a selective 5-HT ( Shin et al 2014 ). The intestinal secretagogues, i e, lubiprostone, linaclotide, an d plecanatide, exert their effect s by increasing intestinal and colonic secretion of chloride-rich fluid into the intestina l lumen. There is no reported evidence indicating that these agents induce HAPCs. Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) OIC is a frequent adverse event of opioid therapy. Opioids exer t their action on the enteric nervous system causing dysmotility, decreased fluid secretion and sphinc ter dysfunction. Laxatives are typically prescribed but often are inadequate to completely relieve constipation ( Brock et al 2012 ). There are 4 products approved for use in OIC: Amitiza (lubiprostone) is FDA-a pproved for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic, non-cancer related pain. Relistor (methylnaltrexone) injec tion is an opioid receptor antagonist indicated for treat ment of OIC in adults with chronic non-cancer pai n and in patients wi th advanced illness o r pain caused by active ca ncer who require opioid dosage escalation for palliative care. Relistor has also been F DA-approved in a tablet formul ation, which is indicated for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. Movantik (naloxegol) and Symproic acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) indicated for the treatment of OIC in adu lt patients with chronic non-cancer pain. For management of OIC, the AGA recommends laxatives as a first- line treatment ( Crockett et al 2019 ). For patients with laxative-refractory OIC, naldemedine or naloxegol are recommended over no treatment, methy lnaltrexone is suggested over no treatment, and there are no recommendations for the use of lubiprostone or prucalopride. Traveler's diarrhea (TD) TD is a type of acute diarrhea t hat develops after the consumpt ion of contaminated food or water during periods of travel. The disease is characterized by symptoms of loose stool s and abdominal cramps. Although generally not serious, TD may result in inconveniences d uring travel, including change s to an itinerary, oversea s medical encounters, and hospitalization ( Riddle et al 2017 ). For the prevention of TD, a 2017 guideline recommends prophylax is with rifaximin in high-risk groups (eg, underlying health conditions); bismuth subsalicylate may be considered sec ond-line in these situatio ns. If rifaximin is used as prophylaxis, azithromycin should also be provided to patients i n case of need for break-through therapy. For the treatment of TD, antimicrobials such as azithromycin, rifaximin , or a fluoroquinolone are reco mmended, with the travel destination guiding the drug(s) of choice ( Riddle et al 2017). Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) HE is a common complication of s evere liver disease. Neuropsych iatric abnormalities, rangi ng from shortened attention span to lethargy, confusion, and coma, are all possible manifes tations depending on disease severity. At this time, pharmacological treatment is only recommended for patients with overt HE, which is diagnosed based on a clinical examination and use of the West H aven Criteria and the Glasgow Coma Score. Secondary pr ophylaxis of HE after an overt HE episode is also recommend ed, as is primary prophylaxis in high-risk patients with cirrhosis ( Vilstrup et al 2014 ). Rifaximin is FDA-approved for the reduction in risk of overt HE recurrence in adults. A joint guideline from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (AASLD/EASL) also recommend this agent as an adjunct therapy to lactulose for the prevention of overt HE recurrence and overt HE recurren ce after the second episode ( Vilstrup et al 2014 ).

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY There are currently no head-to- head trials comparing the availa ble agents used in the treatme nt of CIC, OIC , IBS-C, and IBS-D. IBS In 2 meta-analyses, improv ements in the FDA-defined composite endpoint of improvement in both daily worst abdominal pain scores and CSBM frequency from baseline compared to placebo after 12 weeks and demonstra ted a similar resul t when compared over 2 6 weeks ( Atluri et al 2014, Videlock et al 2013 ). More patients in the placebo treatment a rm failed to achieve the FDA endpoint compared with patients treated with linaclotide (82.6% vs 66%; relative risk [ RR] of failure to respond, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.85). A 2018 network meta-analysis the secretagogues linaclotide , lubiprostone, plecanatide, and tenapanor (not available in the U.S.) for the treatment of IBS-C in 15 randomized cont rolled trials (N = 8462). Linaclotide 290 mg once daily was ranked first in efficacy base d on the FDA-recommended endpoint for IBS-C trials, abdominal pain, and CSBMs; plecanatide 6 mg once daily was rank ed highest for safety ( Black et al 2018 ). The network meta-analysis was u pdated in 2019 to include 3 12-w eek Phase 3 randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of tegaserod in 2472 female patients wi th IBS-C. For the FDA- recommended endpoint, all agents, including tegaserod, were significantly more effective than placebo, but linaclotide 290 mcg daily was ranked as the most effective for achievi ng at least a 30% improvement in abdominal pain along with an increase of at least 1 CSBM/week from baseline for at least 50% of treatment-weeks; te gaserod 6 mg twice a day was ranked third. Indirect comparison of active treatments showed no significant differenc es between individual drugs and dosages. (Black et al 2019b ). A 2019 network meta-analysis tha t included 18 randomized controlled trials (N = 9844) compared the efficacy of alosetron, eluxadoline, ramosetr on, and rifaximin in patients w ith IBS-D or IBS-M. All agent s were found to be more effective than placebo. In an analysis that ranked agents based on their efficacy in improving both abdominal pain and stool consistency, effect on gl obal symptoms of IBS, and effect on stool consistency, alose tron 1mg twice daily was ranked highest (ie, most effective). Ramosetron 2.5 mcg once daily was ranked highest for relief from abdominal pain (Black et al 2019a ). 87 Data as of August 15, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/ALS Page 5 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

For the treatment of I BS-C, placebo-controlled trials demonstra ted that lubiprostone had a significantly higher percentage of overall responders. In multiple 12-week studies, lubiprostone-treated pati ents reported significant improvements in abdominal pain/discomfort, stool consistency, s training, constipation se verity, and quality of life (Drossman et al 2007, Drossman et al 2009, Johanson et al 2008b ). In 2 randomized, double-blind, pla cebo-controlled, 12-week stud ies, there were significant ly more overa ll responders (based on improved abdominal pai n and weekly CSBM from baseline) with plecanatide 3 mg vs placebo in patients with IBS-C (Study 1: 30% vs 18% ; Study 14%) multicenter, ra ndomized controlled trials ( 301, 358, and 307) of similar design in 2470 adults patients ev aluated the efficacy and safety of tegaserod vs placebo. In trial 301, treatment with tegaserod resulted in a statistic ally significant improvement i n response rate vs placebo with a difference of 11.4% (95% CI, 3 to 30; p < 0.005). Trials 358 and 307 demonstrated treatment differences vs placebo of 4.7% and 5.3%, respectively, but results were not statistically significant. ( FDA Medical Review(s) [Zelnorm] 2002, FDA Multi-Disciplinary Review [Zelnorm] 2019, M\u00fcller-Lissner et al 2001, Novick et al 2002 ). A systematic review of various therapies for the treatment of IBS included 1 systematic rev iew of 11 RCTs (n = 9242) evaluating tegaserod vs placebo for the treatment of IBS-C. The outcome of proportion of pat ients with persistent IBS-C symptoms with tegaserod was 55% (3301/6041) vs 64% (2032/3201) with placebo. Treatment with tegaserod was shown to be superior vs place bo with an RR of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.8 0 to 0.90) with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10 (95% CI, 8 to 14) ( Ford et al 2009, Ford and Vandvik 2012 ). A 2004 systematic review and meta -analysis included 4 double-blind controlled trials (n = 3 564) evaluating tegaserod in the treatment of IBS-C. In each tr ial, a statistically signific ant effect on constipation, abdomin al pain/discomfort, bloating and global relief with tegaserod treatment was demonstrated in women, with the difference between placebo and tegaserod of 10 to 15%, primarily due to a high placebo respons e (Lesbros-Pantoflickova et al 2004 ). Treatment with alosetron is assoc iated with a significantly gre ater proportion o f patients reporting adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort, and improvem ents in bowel function compared to placebo ( Camilleri et al 2000, Camilleri et al 2001, Chey et al 2004, Lembo et al 2001, Lembo et al 2004, Rahimi et al 2008, Watson et al 2001 ). A meta-analysis concluded that t he 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 ( 5-HT3) antagonists as a cl ass significantly improve symptoms of non-constipating or I BS-D in both men and women compared to placebo; however , these agents were also associated with a greater increase in the risk of causing const ipation compared to placebo (Andresen et al 2008 ). Alosetron treatment has been show n to positively impact global symptoms, as well as pain and discomfort in non- constipated females with IBS. T his analysis further supports the increased chance of dev eloping constipation with alosetron compared to placebo ( Cremonini et al 2003 ). The safety and efficacy of elux adoline for treatment of IBS-D w ere established in 2 randomized, multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinic al trials in which 2427 patient s with IBS-D (meeting Rome III criteria), average abdominal pain scores g reater than 3 on a 0 to 10 scale during the we ek prior to randomization, and a Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) of 5 .5 or greater wi th at least 5 d ays of BSS of 5 or more d uring the week prior to randomization. Patients were rand omly assigned to receive eluxa doline 75 mg, 100 mg, or placebo twice daily. The primary endpoint was defined by t he simultaneous improvement in the daily worst abdominal pai n score by 30% or more compared to the baseline weekly a verage and a reduction in the BSS to 5 or less on at least 50% of the days within a 12-week or 26-week time interva l. From weeks 1 through 12, the primary endpoint was achiev ed by 23.9% of patients in the 75 mg group (p = 0.01) and 25.1% of patients in the 100 mg group (p = 0.004) versus 17 .1% of patients in the placebo group. From weeks 1 thro ugh 26, 23.4% in the 75 mg grou p (p = 0.11) and 29.3% i n the 100 mg group (p < 0.001) achieved the primary endpoi nt compared to 19% in the pla cebo group ( Lembo et al 2016a ). The safety and efficacy of elux adoline for the treatment of IBS -D were also studied in patients with an inadequate response to loperamide in a randomized, multicenter, multinatio nal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 4 trial (n = 346). Patients with IBS-D (meeting Rome III criteria), average abdominal pain scores > 3 on a 0 to 10 scale during the week prior to randomization, a BSS of 5.5 with at least 5 day s of BSS 5 during the week prior to r andomization, and a self-reported inadequate res ponse to loperamide within the pr evious year were randomized to eluxadoline 100 mg or placebo twice daily. The primary endpoint was the proportion of composite responders, defined as improvement in the daily worst abdominal pain scor e by 40% and < 5 BSS score for a t least 50% of treatment days. Over the 12-week treatment period, significantly more eluxadoline- vs placebo-tr eated patients achieved the primary composite endpoint (22.7% vs 10.3%; p = 0.002) as well as the individual components of the endpoint (improvement in stool consistency [27.9% vs 16.7%; p = 0.01] and im provement in the daily worst a bdominal pain score by 40% [43.6% vs 31.0%; p = 0.02]) ( Brenner et al 2019 ). 88 Data as of August 15, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/ALS Page 6 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The safety and effect iveness of rifaximin for treatment of IBS- D were established in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In the first 2 trials, 1 ,258 patients with IBS-D (Rome II crite ria) were randomly assigned to receive rifaximin 550 mg 3 times daily (n = 624) or placebo (n = 634) for 14 days, and the n followed for a 10-week treatment-free period. The primary endpoint for both trials w as the proportion of patients who achieved adequate relief of IBS signs and symptoms for at least 2 of 4 weeks during the month following 1 4 days of treatment. More rifaximin-treated patients reported improvements in abdominal pain and stool consistency than those on placebo (Tri al 1: 47% vs 39%; p < 0.05; Trial 2: 47% vs 36%; p < 0. 01 in rifaximin and placebo gr oups, respectively). TARGET3 was the third trial, w hich evaluated repeat courses of rifaximin in adult patients with IBS-D (Rome III criteria) for up to 46 weeks. Dur ing a 14-day open-label phase, 1,074 patients responded to rifaximin and were evaluated over 22 weeks for continued response or recurrence of IBS symptoms. A total of 636 patients who developed recurrent signs and sy mptoms after a single treatment course of rifaximin were randomized to receive either rifaximin 550 mg 3 times daily (n = 328) or placebo (n = 308) for 2 additional 14-day courses sepa rated by 10 weeks. More patients treated wi th rifaximin than placebo were r esponders in abdominal pain and stool consistency in this phase of the study (38% vs 31% in rifaximin and placebo gr oups, respectively; < 0.05) ( ClinicalTrials.gov 2019, Lembo et al 2016b). IBS and CIC A 2018 systematic review and meta-a nalysis compared the efficac y treatment chronic constipation or IBS-C (Lasa et al 2018 ). For patients with chronic c onstipation, intestinal secretagogues were superior to placebo for increasing the number of CSBMs per week (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.83 [analys is included linaclotide, lubiprostone, and plecanatide]) and for achieving 3 SBMs per week (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.85 [analysis included linaclotide and lubiprostone]). F or those with IBS-C, intestina l secretagogues were superior to placebo for increase in CSBMs per week (RR, 2.44; 95% C tenapano 3 SBMs per week (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1 .74 to 2.24 [analysis include d linaclotide only). In a systematic review and meta-analysis, both linaclotide and plecanatide were efficacious for IBS-C and CIC compared to placebo. Diarrhea wa s more frequent with both drugs compared to placebo. In an indirect comparison, there were no differences between the 2 agents for efficacy in CIC, efficacy in IBS-C, freq uency of diarrhea, or study withdrawal due to diarrhea ( Shah et al 2018 ). A network meta-analysis of 13 RCTs evaluated the efficacy and t olerability of tegaserod fo r the treatment of IBS and chronic constipation in patient s, predominantly women, 12 yea rs of age ( Evans et al 2007 ). In patients with IBS-C, for the Subject Global Assessment (SGA) of relief in patients, tegaserod resulted in a statistically significant benefi t in 2 trials, compared with a nonsignificant trend for benefit i n the remaining 2 studies. For abdominal pain an d discomfort, the RR fo r being a responder with tegaserod vs placebo was non-significant; for bowel habits (as measured by res ponder rate), 1 trial did not s uggest a benefit with tegas erod, and 2 trials showed a nonsignificant trend in favor of tegaserod. For patients with chronic consti pation, the RR of being a respo nder in terms of CSBMs/we ek with tegaserod 12 mg vs placebo was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.35 to 1.75), with a weighted mean d ifference (WMD) of 0.6 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.78). Differences between tegaserod and placebo in increases in BM fr equency were small (< 1/week). CIC A network meta-analysis demonstra ted linaclotide and lubiprostone to be superior to placebo for the treatment of CIC. Treatment with linaclotide resulted in a significant increase i n the proportion of patients wi th 3 complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs)/week com pared with placebo with an RR o f 1.96 (95% confidence in terval [CI], 1.12 to 3.44), and was superior vs placebo with an increase over baseli ne by 1 CSBM/week (RR, 1. 72; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.52). For change from baseline in the number of SBMs/week, the weight ed mean difference (WMD) with lubiprostone was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.41 to 2.41) and WM D with linaclotide was 2.11 (95% CI, 1.68 to 2.54) (Nelson et al 2017 ). A meta-analysis demonstrated t he total pooled treatment effect of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs)/week in patients with CIC or IBS-C was greater in lubiprostone-treated patients compared with plac ebo (combined standardized difference in means, 0.419; 95% CI, 0.088 to 0.750; p < 0.001) ( et al 2016 ). A meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials evaluated th e safety and efficacy of prucalopride in the management of CIC ( Sajid et al 2016 ). The primary outcome measure wa s the incidence of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week, and the secondary outco me measure was adverse events. Based on data from 9 trials, prucalopride 2 mg significantly reduced the incidence of SBM s per week compared with placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.34; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.56; I2 = 78%; p = 0.003). 89 Data as of August 15, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/ALS Page 7 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. The risk of developing adverse e vents (eg, headache, abdominal cramps, excessive flatulence, dizziness, diarrhea, rash) was higher in the prucalop ride 2 mg group (odds ratio [OR ], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.34; I2 = 53%; p < 0.0001). The majority of adverse events were reported within the first 2 4 hours of initiation of therapy and were transient. A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of serotonin type 4 (5-HT 4) agonists, including prucalopride, velusetrag, and naronapride (not approved in the U.S.) for the treat ment of CIC. 5-HT 4 agonists were superior to control for a ll measured outcomes (Shin et al 2014 ). The proportion of pat ients randomized to a 5 HT4 agonist who achieved a mean of 3 CSBMs per week was 27.5% vs 17.2% of patients randomized to control (RR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1 .23 to 2.79; I2 = 89%; p < 0.001). Overall, 46.7% of patients randomized to a 5 HT4 agonist achieved a mean increase of 1 CSBM per week over baseline vs 30.8% of control pati ents (RR, 1.57; 95% p < 0.001). 5-HT 4 agonists also showed significant improvement over control for patient-reported quality of life (QOL) measures. Adverse events were more common with 5 HT4 agonists than with control (RR, 1 .25; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.38) an d included headache, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. In another meta-analysis, treatm ent with linaclotide 145 mcg de monstrated significant imp rovements in the weekly frequency of CSBMs from baseline compared with placebo in patie nts with CIC (RR, 3.80 ; 95% CI, 2.20 to 6.55). Results were similar for abdomi nal discomfort or bloating respo nders for linaclotide 145 mg v s placebo, with pooled RRs of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.26 to 1.97) a nd 1.97 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.69), ). A double-blind, placebo-controlled, trolled trial treatment linaclotide 72 mcg improved the CSBM frequency over 12-weeks compared with placebo, with 13.4% of linaclotide-treated patients meeting responder requirements compared with 4.7% in the o group (95% CI, 1.8% to 5.2%) ( Schoenfeld et al 2018 ). Results from a long-term safety study illustrated that overall lubiprostone was well tole rated. The most commonly reported events were diarrhea, nausea, urinary tract infection, sinusitis, abdominal distension, and headache. Significant changes from baseline in hematology, laboratory values, vital s igns, weight, body mass inde x and physical examination were not seen over the study duration ( Chey et al 2012 ). Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized controlled trials demonstrated that treatment with plecanatide 3 mg significantly increased weekly CSBM frequency as measured by the overal l CSBM responder rate vs placebo (Study 1: 21.0% vs 10.2%; p < 0.001; Study 2: 20.1% p = 0.004) randomized c of similar design in adults (N = 2484) evaluated the safety and efficacy of prucalopride for the treatment of CIC in an integrat ed analysis of the results (Camilleri et al 2016, Prucalopride FDA briefing document 2018). The percentage of patients with a mean frequency of 3 CSBMs/w eek over a 12-week treatment period was significantly higher with prucalopride 2 mg/day (27.8%) vs plac ebo (13.2%) 3.33; p < 0.001); the NNT with prucalopri de was 8.8 (95% CI, 7.1 to 11.6) . Efficacy and safety outcome s were not significantly different between men and women. The proportion of patients with a mean increase of 1 CSBM/wee k was 47.0% with prucal opride vs 29.9% with placebo (p < 0.001). Out of the 6 trials, the 24-week tr ial failed to demonstrate st atistical significance for t he primary endpoint after both 12 and 24 weeks, causing moderate het erogeneity. The reasons for t he smaller treatment effec t in this study remain unclear. Due to its differing mode of act ion, prucalopride may be benefi cial for patients with CIC who have an insufficient quantity of high-amplitude propagat ing contractions (HAPCs) or in those who do not respond to other medications (Camilleri et al 2016 ). OIC Two randomized, double-blind, p lacebo-controlled trials, COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2, were conducted in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC to assess the eff icacy and safety of naldemed ine. The primary endpoint was the proportion of responders , where response was defined as at 3 SBMs per week. P atients in COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 were randomized to receive naldemedine 0.2 mg (n = 274; n = 277) or placebo (n = 273; n = 276) once daily for 12 weeks. Results from both COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 s howed that participants receiving naldemedine 0.2 mg experienced a significant ly higher response compared to patients receiving placebo in both studies (COMPOSE- 1 responders: 47.6% adverse due to gastrointestinal disorders were more common with naldemedine than with placebo in both studies (15% vs 7% and 16% and 7%, respectively ) (Hale et al 2017 ). 90 Data as of August 15, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/ALS Page 8 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

COMPOSE-4 was a 2-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-contro lled trial of naldemedine 0.2 mg in patients with OIC and cancer, and COMPOSE-5 wa s a 12-week, open-label extensi on study. In COMPOSE-4, there were significantly more SBM responders in the naldemedine group comp ared to placebo (71.1% v s 34.4%; p < 0.0001). Treatment-emergent adverse event s were also higher with naldeme dine vs placebo (44.3% vs 26.0%; p = 0.01). In the extension study, 80.2% of pati ents experienced a treatment-emer gent adverse event, most co gastrointestinal adverse events ( Katakami et al 2017 ). In a 2019 meta-analysis of 6 rand omized controlled trials (N = 2762), naldemedine was superior to placebo in SBM response rate (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.93 to 4.65), change in SBM f requency (OR, 6.46; 95% CI, 4 .73 to 8.20), and change in complete SBM frequency (OR, 5 .93; 95% CI, 4.90 to 6.96) ( Esmadi et al 2019 ). A total of 1,300 patients were enrolled in 3, double-blind, ran domized controlled trials evaluating lubiprostone compared to placebo in patients with chronic, non-cancer related pain on stable opioid therapy and constipation. In Study 1, overall responder rate, the primary outco me, was defined as 1 SBM imp rovement over baseline for all treatment weeks and 3 SBMs per week for at least 9 w eeks of the 12-week study perio d. Lubiprostone (27.1%) significantly higher than placebo (18.9%; p = 0.03) ( Jamal et al 2015). The primary outcome parameter for Study 2 and 3 was the mean change from baseline in SBM frequency at wee k 8. In Study 2, lubiprostone significantly increased the mean change from baseline in SBM frequency compared to plac ebo (p = 0.004). In Study 3 , the difference was not statistically significant; howev er, Study 3 was the only study that enrolled patient s who received diphenylheptane opioids such as methadone. Studies 2 and 3 have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal at this time. A prospective, randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled tri al was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lubiprostone for relieving sympt oms of OIC in adult patients wi th chronic non-cancer pain. O IC was defined as < 3 SBMs per week. Patients were randomiz ed to receive lubiprostone 24 m cg (n = 210) or placebo (n = 218) twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was c hange from baseline in SBM frequency at week 8. Changes from baseline in SBM frequency rates were significant ly higher at week 8 (p = 0.005) and overall (p = 0.004) in patients treated with lubiprostone compared with plac ebo. The most common treatment-r elated adverse events with lubiprostone and placebo were nausea (16. 8% vs 5.8%, respectively), diarrhea (9. 6% vs 2.9%, respectively) , and abdominal distention (8.2% vs 2.4%, respectively). No lubiprostone-related serious a dverse events occurred ( Cryer et al 2014 ). A 2013 systematic rev iew evaluated pharmacological therapies fo r the treatment of OIC. A total of 14 randomized clinical trials of mu-opioid receptor antagonists were included . All treatments, including methylnaltrexone, naloxone, and alvimopan, were superior to placebo for the treatment of OIC. Lubiprostone was included in the review; however, the reporting of data precluded meta-analysis ( Ford et al 2013 ). In 2014, another systematic revi ew of 21 randomized clinical tr ials evaluated 7 pharmacological treatments for OIC. Efficacy assessment was based on objective outcome measures (OOMs): BM frequency, BM with in 4 hours, and time to first BM. Methylnaltrexone show ed improvements in all 3 OOMs. R andomized controlled trials with naloxone and alvimopan tended to be effective for BM frequency measures. Nal oxegol (12.5 mg) impr oved all OOMs. Though effectiveness was demons trated for all OOMs , grou p differences were small to moderate. CB-5945 (not FDA-approved) and prucalopride (n ot FDA-approved for OIC) tende d to increase BM frequency, e specially with doses of 0.1 mg twice daily and 4 mg daily, respectively. Besides nausea and diarrhea, abdominal pain was the most frequent adverse event for all drugs except for alvi mopan. Treatment-rel ated serious adverse events were slightly higher for alvimopan (cardiac events) and prucalopride (severe abdominal p ain, headache) ( Siemens et al 2015 ). The efficacy of naloxegol has b een established in K4 and K5, 2 replicate Phase 3 clinical tr ials with a total of 1,352 participants with OIC who had taken opioids for at least 4 weeks for non-cancer related pain. P articipants were randomly assigned to receive oral nalox egol 12.5 mg or 25 mg or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The trials were designed to measure a response rate, defi ned as 3 SBMs per week and an increase of 1 SBM from baseline. Results from K4 showed that parti cipants receiving naloxegol 25 mg or naloxegol 12.5 mg both experienced a significantly higher response rate compared to participants rec eiving placebo (p = 0.001 a nd p = 0.02, respectively). Results from K5 also showed sign ificantly higher response rates in participants receiving naloxegol 25 mg vs placebo (p = 0.02) but did not show a si gnificant difference in respons e rate in patients receiv ing naloxegol 12.5 mg vs placebo (p = 0.2) ( Chey et al 2014 ). In K4, patients with an inadequat e response to laxatives achiev ed a significantly higher response with naloxegol 25 mg vs placebo (p = 0.002) and wi th naloxegol 12.5 mg vs placebo (p = 0.03). In K5, patients receiving naloxegol 25 mg achieved a significantly higher response rate vs placebo (p = 0.01); however, patients receiving naloxegol 12.5 mg did not have a significa ntly higher response rate. Median time to first SBM was si gnificantly shorter with both naloxegol 12.5 mg and 25 mg compared to placebo in K4 and was significantly shorter wit h naloxegol 25 mg in K5 (p < 0 .001 for all comparisons). 91 Data as of August 15, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/ALS Page 9 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Average pain scores and opioid use remained relatively stable i n both studies for patients receiving naloxegol; thus, centrally mediated analgesia was preserved. Clinical trials of methylnaltrex one injection in patients with advanced illness have shown response over several months with most patients reporting laxative effects similar to SBMs a nd predictable timing ( Bull et al 2015, Thomas et al 2008 ). Similar findings have been report ed in patients with OIC with c hronic non-cancer pain (Michna et al 2011, Webster et al 2017 ). The efficacy of methylnaltrexone tablets was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, p lacebo-controlled study in patients using opioids for chroni c non-cancer pain. Patients we re randomized to methylnaltrexone (150 mg, 300 mg, or 450 mg) or placebo once daily for a period of 4 weeks followed by as-needed dosing for 8 weeks. A responder to methylnaltrexone treatment was def ined as a patient with 3 SB Ms per week, with an incr ease of 1 SBMs per week over baseline, for at least 3 w eeks in the 4-week treatment per iod. The percentage of patient s classified as responders was 42.8%, 49.3% (p = 0.03 vs placebo), 51. 5% (p = 0.005 vs placebo), and 38.3% in the methylnaltrexone 150 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg and placebo groups, respectively ( Rauck et al 2017 ). A systematic review a nd network analysis compared the efficacy and safety of agents for the treatment of OIC, including lubiprostone, naldemedine, naloxegol, subcutaneous (SC) and oral OIC) and alvimopan FDA-approved for OIC) ( Sridharan and Sivaramakrishan 2018 ). Observations from 16 randomized with patients demonst rated oral perf ormed vs placebo in terms of rescue-free bowel movements (RFBM). Based on the odds ratios from direct and indirect pooled estimates, trea tment with SC methylnaltrexone resulted in naldemedine were associated with increas ed risks of adverse e vents, while SC methylnaltrexone did not signifi cantly affect the analgesia due to background opio id use. Of note, the quality of evidence for the comparisons was either low or very low. Another systematic review and network analysis of 27 studies fo und methylnaltrexone, naloxone, naloxegol, naldemedine, alvimopan, and lubiprostone significantly more eff icacious than placebo for OIC ( Nee et al 2018 ). A systematic review and networ k meta-analysis of 27 studies com pared the efficacy safety of methylnaltrexone, naloxone, naldemedine, naloxegol, lubiprostone, are not cu rrently approved in the U.S. in OIC. The authors found that when non-re sponse was defined as a failure to achieve an average of 3 BMs per week with an incr ease of 1 BM per week from ba seline or an average of 3 BMs per week, naloxone was the most efficacious treatment for OIC (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0 .52 to 0.80) and the safest w hen ranked against other agents. When non-response was defined as only failure to achiev e an average of 3 BMs per week with an increase of 1 BM per week from baseline, naldemedine was found to be the most efficacious (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.77), followed ( Luthra ). TD Both a 2012 and 2017 meta-analysis including 4 and 5 randomized , placebo-controll ed trials, respectively, demonstrated the superiority of rifaximin in preventing TD. In the 2012 anal ysis by Alajbegovic et al , rifaximin reduced the risk of disease by 67% (RR, 0.33; 95% C I, 0.24 to 0.45 ), while the 201 7 analysis by Ng et al showed a 52.2% RR reduction (RR, 0.478; 95% CI, 0.375 to 0.610). Neither analysis reported any new safety signals ( Alajbegovic et al 2012 and Ng et al 2017 ). HE Interventions for the treatment o f overt HE were compared in a 2014 network meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials (N = 10,007). Results showed no significant difference b etween neomycin and rifaximin when considering the outcomes of clinical improvemen t, blood ammonia concentration, and mental status. However, neomycin demonstrated an increased risk of adverse event s when compared to rifaximin (OR, 14.03; 95% CI, 0 .06 to 3035.53) ( Zhu et al 2015 ). A 2019 meta-analysis evaluated w hether the addition of rifaximi n to lactulose improved outco mes in patients with overt HE. A total of 2276 patients were included across 5 randomized controlled trials and 5 observ ational studies. In a pooled analysis of data from all 10 studies, combination therapy improved efficacy (risk differenc e [RD], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.32) and reduced the risk of death (RD, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.19 t o -0.03). Similar trends were seen in separate analyses that included only data from the randomized controlled trials. The risk of adverse events was similar between combination therapy and lactulos e alone (RD, 0.06; 95% CI, 0. 24 to 0.13) ( Wang et al 2019 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES IBS The 2018 American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) monograph o n the management of IBS makes the following statements (reported with the st rength of recommendation and qu ality of evidence, respectively) ( Ford et al 2018): 92 Data as of August 15, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/ALS Page 10 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Recommends linaclotide, plecanati de, and lubiprostone for overa ll symptom improvement in patients with IBS-C (strong; high, moderate, and mode rate quality of evidence ratin g, respectively). Suggests rifaximin for reduction in global IBS symptoms, as well as bloating in non-cons tipated patients (weak; moderate) Suggests alosetron for overall symptom improvement in female pa tients with IBS-D (weak; low quality). Suggests eluxadoline for overall symptom improvement in patient s with IBS-D (weak; moderate). Recommends fiber for overall symptom improvement (strong; moder ate). Antidepressants: Recommends TCAs for overall symptom improvemen t (strong; high quality); suggests SSRIs for overall symptom improvement (weak; low quality). Suggests against polyethylene gl ycol (PEG) and loperamide for overall symptom improvement. The AGA guideline on management o f IBS makes the following stat ements (reported with the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence, respectively) ( Weinberg et al 2014 ): Recommends using linaclotide (over no drug treatment) in patien ts with IBS-C (strong; high) Suggests using lubiprostone (ove r no drug treatment) in patient s with IBS-C (conditional; moderate) Suggests using rifaximin (over no drug treatment) in patients w ith IBS-D (conditional; moderate) Suggests using alosetron (over no drug treatment) in patients w ith IBS-D to improve global symptoms (conditional; moderate) The 2015 WGO guideline on IBS lists rifaximin and alosetron as second-line therapies for IBS- D, although it notes a risk of ischemic colitis and constipation with alosetron. Lubiprosto ne and linaclotide are noted to b e safe and effective for the treatment of IBS-C ( WGO, 2015 ). CIC The 2014 ACG monograph on the management of IBS and CIC makes the following statements (reported with the strength of recommendation and qu ality of evidence, respectively) ( Ford et al 2014 ). Of note, only statements pertaining to CIC are included as the monograph on IBS management was upda ted in 2018: Linaclotide is effective in CIC (strong; high) Lubiprostone is effective in the treatment of CIC (strong; high) Prucalopride is more effective than placebo in improving symptoms of CIC (strong; moderate) Although supported by varying levels of e vidence, fiber supplem ents, osmotic laxatives (PEG, lactulose), and stimulant laxatives (sodium pic osulfate [not available in the U .S. as a single agent], bisac odyl) are recommended for the treatment of CIC (all Strong recommendations). Additional guidelines on the management of constipation suggest increased fiber intake and os motic laxatives. Stimulant laxatives are to be used as neede d or as \"rescue agents\". Lubip rostone and linaclotide can be considered when symptoms of constipation do not respond to laxatives ( AGA 2013, Bharucha et al 2013, Lindberg et al 2010 ). OIC For the management of OIC, the AGA recommends laxatives as a fi rst-line treatment ( Crockett et al 2019 ). For patients with laxative refractory OIC, naldemedine or naloxegol are recommended over no treatment. Methylnaltrexone is suggested over no treatment, but authors note that evidence supporting the use of this agen t for OIC is low and costs may be prohibitive. The AGA does not make any recommendations for the use of lubiprostone or prucalopride for OIC due to lack of evidence. TD Guidelines for TD were publish ed in 2017 and recommend rifaximin for moderate-to-severe cases of the disease. If rifaximin is used as prophylaxis , azithromycin should also be p rovided to patients in case of need for break-through therapy. For the treatment of TD, antimicrobials such as azithromycin, rifaximin, or a fluoroquinolone are recommended, with the travel destination guiding the drug(s) of choice ( Riddle et al 2017 ). HE A joint guideline from AASLD and EASL recommends rifaximin as a n adjunct therapy to lactulose for the prevention of overt HE and recurrent episodes o f HE after the second episode (Vilstrup et al 2014 ). SAFETY SUMMARY Contraindications: Amitiza is contraindicated with k nown or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction. Lotronex has several contraindications, including a history of chronic or severe constipation or sequelae from constipation; intestinal gastrointestinal perforation, and/or adhesions; ischemic 93 Data as of August 15, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/ALS Page 11 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Motegrity is contraindicated in patients with intestinal perfor ation or obstruction due to a structural or functional disorder of the gut wall, obstruc tive ileus, and severe inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and toxic megacolon/megarectum; and when there is a known serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction to the drug or any of its excipients. Movantik is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction and at increased risk of recurrent obstruction, in patient s with concomitant use of stro ng cytochrome (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (eg, clarithromycin, ketoconazole), and there is a known serious or severe hype rsensitivity reaction to the drug or any of its excipients. Relistor is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction and at increased risk of recurrent obstruction. Symproic is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruc tion or at increased risk of recurrent obstruction, a nd when there is a known serious or sev ere hypersensitivity reacti on to the drug or any of its excipients. Viberzi has several contraindica tions, including use in patients with the following conditions: known or suspected biliary duct obstruction or sphinc ter of Oddi disease or dysfun ction; alcoholism, alcohol abuse, alcohol addiction, or more than 3 alcoholic beverages daily; history of pancreatitis or structural diseases of the pancreas including known or suspected pancreatic duct obs truction; severe hepatic impair ment; history of severe cons tipation or sequelae from constipation; known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal ob struction; use in patients without a gallbladder; or known hypersensitivity to the drug. On March 15, 2017, the FDA warned that Viber zi should not be us ed in patients who do no t have a gallbladder. The safety announcement was based on an FDA review that found these patients have an increased risk of developing serious pancreatitis that could result in hospitalization or de ath (FDA Drug Safety Communication 2017 ). A contraindication was added to the prescribing label for patient s without a gallbladder due to an increased risk of developing serious pancreatitis . Pancreatitis was reported in p atients taking either the 75 mg or 100 mg dose with most of the cases of serious pan creatitis occurring within a we ek of starting treatment. Xifaxan is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to rifaximin, any of the rifamy cin antimicrobial agents, or any of the components in Xifaxan. Zelnorm is contraindicated in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, tr ansient ischemic attack, or angina; a history of ischemic colitis or other forms of intesti nal ischemia; severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease; and moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Boxed Warnings: Linzess and Trulance are contra indicated in pediatric patients 6 years of age and younger d ue to the risk of serious dehydration; use should be avoi ded in children 6 to 17 years of age. Lotronex has a Boxed Warning rega rding serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as ischemic colitis and serious complications of consti pation that may lead to hospital ization, blood transfusi on, surgery, and/or death. If patients develop constipation or ischemic colitis, Lotronex sho uld be discontinued. Lotronex should be used only in female patients with severe I BS-D who have not benefited from u sual therapies. Warnings/precautions: Amitiza: nausea (29% incidence in CIC), diarrhea (12% in CIC), syncope and hypotension, dyspnea, and bowel obstruction Motegrity and Zelnorm: Worsening of depression and emergence of suicidal thoughts and beh avior may occur during therapy. Patients shoul d discontinue the dr ug and contact their provider if these situations occur. Movantik, Relistor, Trulance, and Zelnorm: Discontinue in the e vent of severe, persisten t, or worsening abdominal pain or diarrhea. Relistor and Symproic: Use with caution in patients with known or suspected lesions of the gastrointestinal tract; discontinue in the event of seve re, persistent, or worsening ab dominal pain. Viberzi: Constipation, sometimes requiring hospitalization, has been reported following administration of Viberzi. Patients who develop severe const ipation should discontinue treatment and contact their health care provider immediately. Zelnorm: Avoid use in patients wi th severe diarrhea. Patients s hould contact their healthca re provider if severe diarrhea, hypotension or syncope occur. 94 Data as of August 15, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/ALS Page 12 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Drug Interactions Amitiza: Diphenylheptane opioids such as methadone may interfer e with the efficacy of Amitiza. Lotronex: Clinically significant d rug interactions associated w ith Lotronex include CYP1A2 moderate inhibitors, CYP3A4 inhibitors, drugs and erythromycin may increase erythromycin concentrations via an unknown mechanism. Concomitant administration of Motegrity and ketoconazole may increase the Motegrity concentrations. Movantik: Concomitant use of M ovantik should be avoided with the following drug classes: moderate inhibitors concentratio other opioid antagoni sts due to potentially additive effects that may increas e risk of opioid withdrawal. I n the event concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, a dos e reduction of Movantik is warr anted. Relistor: Concomitant use of Relistor with other opioid antagon ists should be avoided due to potentially additive effects that may increase the risk of opioid withdrawal. Symproic: Concomitant use of Sym proic should be with rong CYP3A inducers (eg, rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John' s Wort) due to a significant decrease in naldemedine concentrations, and other opioid antagonists due to potent ially additive effect of opioid receptor antagonism that may i ncrease the risk of opioid withdrawal. Moderate concentrations. Drug interactions with Viberzi which potentially may r esult in clinically relevant e ffects include the following drug classes: organic that are P-glycopr otein inhibitors with Xifax an can substantially increase systemic exposure to r ifaximin. Caution shou ld be exercised whe n concomitant use of Xifax an and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor such as cycl osporine needed. tion Strategy (REMS): Lotronex has REMS that distribut es education to providers about the risks for ischemic colitis and serious complications of constipation ( FDA REMS program 2019 ). Adverse events: The IBS and constipation agents are most commonly associated wi th gastrointestinal-rel ated adverse events. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Table 4.

CONCLUSION There are currently no head-to- head trials comparing the availa ble agents used in the treatme nt of CIC, OIC , IBS-C, and IBS-D. IBS is a gastrointestinal disorder with symptoms of abdominal pain, discomfort and bloating , and abnormal bowel habits with bouts of diarrhea and/or constipation ( Andresen et al 2008, Ford et al 2018, Quigley et al 2012, WGO 2015 ). IBS has 4 subtypes depending on the change in bowel habits: IBS-D, IBS-C, IBS-M, or IBS-U. Most patients with mild disease are managed with disease state education and support, c oupled with lifestyle modifications, including diet c hanges and stress reduction and, when possible, symptom control ( Andresen et al 2008, Ford the treatment of IBS-C. Amitiza is a selective chloride channel 5-HT 4 agonist that was re-introduced market eluxadoline), and of IBS-D. Viberzi is a mu-opioid receptor agonist and a contr olled substance. Xifaxan is a rifamycin antibacterial. Patients with IBS-D who e xperience recurrence with Xifaxan treatment may be retreated up to 2 times with the same regimen. Lotronex is limited to use in fe males with chronic, severe IBS- D who have not responded to conventional therapy. Due to serious safety concerns , Lotronex has a boxed warning re garding risk of gastroint estinal adverse events including ischemic colitis, a nd also has a REMS program. The 2018 ACG monograph on the management of IBS strongly recomm ends that Linzess and Amitiza are superior to placebo for the treatment of IBS-C , and Trulance is effective in IBS-C; they weakly reco mmend that Xifaxan is effective in reducing IBS symp toms and bloating in IBS-D, Lotro nex is effective in females with IBS-D, and Viberzi is superior to placebo in IBS-D ( Ford et al 2018 ). The 2014 ACG monograph on the m anagement of CIC and IBS notes t hat linaclotide and lubiprostone are each effective for the treatment of C IC, and prucalopride is more ef fective than placebo in improving symptoms of CIC ( Ford et al 2014 ). Additional guidelines on management of constipation suggest inc reased fiber intake and osmotic laxatives ( AGA 2013, Bharucha et al 2013, Lindberg et al 2010 ). Stimulant laxatives are to b e used as needed or as \"rescue a gents.\" Amitiza and Linzess can be conside red when symptoms of constipa tion do not respond to laxatives. Amitiza, Linzess, Motegrity (pru calopride), and Trulance are in dicated for the treatment of CIC. Motegrity is a selective 5-HT 4 receptor ther e is no reported evidence indi cating that these agents induce peristalsis. For management of OIC, the AGA recommends laxatives as a first- line treatment ( Crockett et al 2019 ). For patients with laxative refractory OIC, Symproi c (naldemedine) or Movantik (na loxegol) are recommended ov er no treatment. Relistor (methylnaltrexone) is suggested over no treatment, but authors note that evidence supporting the use of this agent for OIC is low. The AGA does not make any recommendations for the u se of Amitiza or Motegrity for OIC due to lack of evidence. Amitiza, Movantik, Relistor, and Symproic are approved for trea tment of OIC in patients with chronic non-cancer pain, and in those chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment in those who do not r equire frequent (eg, weekly) opioid dosage escalation. Relisto r injection is also approved i n patients with advanced illness or pain caused by active cancer who require opioid dosage escalation for palliative care . Movantik, Relistor, and Symproic are PAMORAs. TD is a type of acute diarrhea t hat develops after the consumpt ion of contaminated food or water during periods of travel. For the prevention of TD , guidelines recommend prophyla xis with rifaximin in high-ri sk groups. If rifaximin is used as prophylaxis, azithromycin sh ould also be provided to patient s in case of need for break-through therapy. For the treatment of TD, antimicrobials such as azithromycin, rifaximin , or a fluoroquinolone are reco mmended, with the travel destination guiding the drug(s) of choice ( Riddle et al 2017). HE is a common complication of s evere liver disease characteriz ed by neuropsychiatric abn ormalities that vary in presentation based on disease severity. The AASLD and EASL reco mmend rifaximin as adjunct therapy to lactulose for the prevention of overt HE recu rrence and overt HE recurrence after the second episode ( Vilstrup et al 2014 ). 98 Data as of August 15, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/ALS Page 16 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Endnotes A. Patients included across the 3 pivotal studies (DREAM, MENSA , and SIRIUS) [2-4] were characterized with clinical features of severe refractory asthm a per American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria [5]. Per the ATS: \"Severe asthma is defined as asthma which requires treatment with high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus a second controller (and/or systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming ' uncontrolled' or which remains 'uncontrolled' despite this therapy.'' This definition includes patients who received an adequate trial of these therapies in whom treatment was stopped due to lack of response. In patients greater than 6 years of age, ''Gold Standard/International Guidelines treatment'' is high dose ICS beta 2-agonist (LABA), leukotriene modifier or theophylline and/or continuous or near continuous systemic corticosteroids as background therapy.\" B. Inclusion criteria was modified from the DREAM study to the MENSA study to be limited to patients with eosinophils greater than or equal to 150 cells /mcL in the peripheral blood at screening or greater than or equal to 300 cells/mcL at some time during the previous year [3]. C. The primary endpoint for the DREAM and MENSA studies was the annual rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations as a composite of t he required use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days, admission, or ED visit. Both studies showed mepolizumab-treated patients experienced a significant improvem ent in exacerbation rates compared with baseline and compared with placebo. [2, 3] D. The 2017 Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention update lists anti- interleukin- 5 treatment as an add on option for patients 12 years of age or older with severe eosinophilic asthma that is uncontrolled on two or more controllers plus as- needed reliever medication (Step 5 drugs) [6]. E. Asthma treatment can often be reduced, once good asthma cont rol has been achieved and maintained for three months and lung function has hit a pla teau. However the approach to stepping down will depend on patient specific factors (e.g., current medications, risk factors). At this time evidence for optimal timing, sequence and magnitude of treatment reductions is limited. It is feasible and safe for most patients to reduce the ICS dose by 25-50% at three month intervals, but complete cessation of ICS is associated with a significant risk of exacerbations [6]. F. Nucala was approved for Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) based on the results from the pivotal, 52-week, Phase III MIRRA study . MIRRA looked at the efficacy and safety of 300 mg of mepolizumab administered SQ ev ery four weeks versus 106placebo as add-on therapy to standard of care (corticosteroids plus or minus immunosuppressants) in 136 patients with relapsing and/or refra ctory EGPA. MIRRA reported statistically significant outcomes with both co-primary endpoints (i.e., accrued time in remission and proportion of patients achieving remissio n) in favor of the treatment group [7, 8]. G. The 2018 Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Preventio n update recommends that patients with asthma should be reviewed regularly to monit or their symptom control, risk factors and occurrence of exacerbations, as well as to doc ument the response to any treatment changes. Ideally, patients should be seen 1-3 mon ths after starting treatment and every 3-12 months thereafter. [6] H.

However the approach to stepping down will depend on patient specific factors (e.g., current medications, risk factors). At this time evidence for optimal timing, sequence and magnitude of treatment reductions is limited. It is feasible and safe for most patients to reduce the ICS dose by 25-50% at three month intervals, but complete cessation of ICS is associated with a significant risk of exacerbations [11]. D. The 2018 Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention update recommends that patients with asthma should be reviewed regularly to monit or their symptom control, risk factors and occurrence of exacerbations, as well as to doc ument the response to any treatment changes. Ideally, patients should be seen 1-3 mon ths after starting treatment and every 3-12 months thereafter. The AS Trial 1 and 2 measured change in FEV1 at week 12. AS Trial 3 measured percentage reduction in or al corticosteroid dose at week 24. [1, 10] 5 . References 1. Dupixent Prescribing Information. sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC. Bridgewater, NJ. June 2019. 2.

Therapeutic Class Overview Antiasthmatic - Monoclonal Antibodies INTRODUCTION Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing, che st tightness, shortness of br eath, and coughing ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2019 ). The exact cause(s) of asthma ar e unknown. A combination of fact ors such as genetics, certa in respiratory infections during childhood, and contact with airborne allergens can contr ibute to its development (CDC 2019 ). The goal of asthma management - asthma control - can be describ ed in the following domains ( National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI] 2007 ): Reduction of impairment Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms (eg, coughing or breathlessness in the daytime, at night, or after exertion) Require infrequent use ( 2 days a week) of short-acting beta-a gonist (SABA) for quick relief of symptoms Maintain (near) normal pulmonary function Maintain normal activity levels (including exercise and other p hysical activity and att endance at work or school) Meet patients' and families' expectations of and satisfaction with asthma care. Reduction of risk Prevent recurrent exacerbations of asthma and minimize the need for emergency department visits or hospitalizations Prevent progressive loss of lung function; for children, preven t reduced lung growth Provide optimal pharmacotherapy with minimal or no adverse effe cts. Current pharmacologic options for asthma management are categor ized as: (1) long-term control medications to achieve and maintain control of persisten t asthma, and (2) quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms and exacerbations. Long-term control medications include: Corticosteroids (inhaled corticosteroids [ICS] for long-term co ntrol; short courses of ora l corticosteroids to gain prompt control of disease, long-te rm oral corticosteroids for severe persistent an ronchodilator for th ose not tolerating a SABA SABAs (therapy of choice for relief of acute symptoms and preve ntion of exercise-induced bronchospasm) Systemic corticosteroids (not s te and severe exacerbations) ( NHLBI 2007 ) Approximately 5 to 10% of asthma patients have severe disease. Severe asthma includes various clinical phenotypes of poorly controlled asthma charac terized by frequent use of high- dose ICS and/or oral corticosteroids ( Chung et al 2014 ). While there are currently no wi dely accepted definitions of spe cific asthma phenotypes, sev eral strategies have been proposed to categorize severe asthma phenotypes based on charac teristics such as patie nt age, disease onset, corticosteroid resistance, chr onic airflow obstruction, or type of cellular infiltrate in t he airway lumen or lung tissue (Walford et al 2014 ). The most recent guideline from the Global Initiative for Ast hma (GINA) on severe or difficult-to-treat asthma recommends assessing for Type 2 inflammation through blo od and sputum eosinophil levels, exhaled nitric oxide asthma ( GINA 2019b ) Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CI U), also called chronic urticar ia or spontaneous urticaria, i s defined by the presence of hives on most days of the week fo r a period of 6 weeks or longe r, with or without angioedema. The hives are circumscribed, raised, erythemat ous plaques, often with central pallor, and variable in size. N o external allergic cause or contributing disease process can be identified in 80 to 90% of adults and children with CIU ( Khan 2019, Saini 2018 ). 123 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 2 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. CIU affects up to 1% of the general population in the United St ates, and the prevalence is belie ved to be similar in other countries. The condition is mor e common in adults than children and typically begins in the th ird to fifth decades of life. CIU is a self-limited disorder i n most patients although the co ndition generally has a prolong ed duration of 2 to 5 years (Saini 2018 ). Non-sedating H 1-antihistamines are the cornerst one of therapy for CIU. Limited courses of oral glucocorticoids are often used in combination with antihis tamines for refractory symptoms . Other pharmacologic options for patients who do not respond to H 1-antihistamines include the use of H 2-antihistamines, leukotriene sulfasala polyangiitis a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that affect s small-to-medium-sized vessels. It is typically associated wi th eosinophilia and severe asthma ( Groh et al 2015, Schwartz et al 2016). EGPA is a rare condition with a p revalence of approximately 13 cases per 1 million persons and an annual incidence of approximately 7 new cases per 1 million persons. It has a highe r incidence in patients with asthma ( Groh et al 2015 ). Systemic glucocorticoids are t he mainstay of treatment for EGPA . For refractory EGPA, the ravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) can be considered (Groh et al 2015). In more than 85% of patients with EGPA, remission can be achiev ed with glucocorticoids with or without an immunosuppressant; how ever, relapses occur in more than 33% ( Pagnoux (AD) is a chr onic inflammatory skin condition characterized by dry skin, ery thema, oozing, crusting, and severe pruritus exacerbated by v arious environmental stimuli. It is associated with increased immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and a history of atopy ( asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema). A genetic defect that l eads to dysfunction of the epidermal skin barrier along wit h an impaired immune response t o microbial entry through the epidermis are believed to be the underlying causes of the condition ( Weston and Howe 2019a ). AD affects up to 25% of childr en and 2 to 3% of adults. It can manifest at different sites d epending on the age at onset. The prevalence appears to be incr easing especially in Western s ocieties ( Sidbury et al 2014 , Weston and Howe ). Topical emollients and topical co rticosteroids are first-line t reatments for AD. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are generally reserved as a second-line treatme nt option. The use of systemic therapies is reserved for patients with moderate to severe disease and can include phototherapy, oral cyclosporine, or other systemic immunosuppressants ( Weston and Howe 2019b ). This antagonists. The mechanism of action of Fasenra is slightly d ifferent, in that it binds to th e IL-5 receptor on immune effe ctor cells, whereas Cinqair and Nucala bind to the IL-5 cytokine. Eosinophils play a key role in the pathobiology of airway disorders by contributing to inflammation thr ough release of leukotrienes and pro-inflammatory cytokin es. Increases in eosinophils are often correlated with great er asthma severity. IL-5, a cyto kine critical to eosinophil di fferentiation and survival, has been isolated as a potential target in eosinophilic asthma. Nuc ala is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with EGPA. Xolair is a recombinant DNA-der ived monoclonal antibody that se lectively binds to human IgE. Xolair, which reduces the allergic response mediators, is useful in a subset of patie nts with allergic asthma . In addition, Xolair has been shown to improve symptoms in patients with CIU. Dupixent is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13. This resu lts in reduction of release of inflammatory mediators includi ng cytokines, chemokines, nitr ic oxide and IgE. These actions are useful for eosinophilic asthma an d controlling symptoms of moderate to sev ere AD. Medispan class: Antiasthmat ic - Monoclonal Antibodies Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY OMALIZUMAB Asthma The original Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of oma lizumab was based on the results of 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials conducted in patients 12 years of age with moderate to severe asthma for 1 year and a positive skin test reaction to a pere nnial aeroallergen. All patient s were required to have a baseline IgE between 30 and 700 in ternational unit (IU)/mL and body weight not more than 150 kg. Patients were treated according to a dosing table to adm inister at least 0.016 mg/kg/IU (IgE/mL) of omalizumab or placebo over each 4-week period. Each study was comprised of a run- in period to achieve a stable conversion to a common ICS, followed by randomization to omalizumab or p lacebo. Patients received omali zumab for 16 weeks with an unchanged ICS dose unless an acute exacerbation ne cessitated an increase. Patients then entered an ICS redu ction phase of 12 ( Busse et al 2001, Sol\u00e8r et al 2001 ) and 16 weeks ( Holgate et al 2004 ) during which ICS dose redu ction was attempted in a stepwise manner. In the 28-week study by Busse e t al (N = 525), during the steroid stable phase, patients treated with omalizumab had fewer mean exacerbations/subject ( 0.28 vs 0.54; p = 0.006) and decreased mean duration of exacerbations (7.8 vs 12.7 days; p < 0.001) compared with placebo-treated patients. Similarly, during the ster oid reduction phase, omalizumab was associated with fe wer exacerbations/subject (0.39 vs 0.66; p = 0.003), and a shorter mean duration of exacerbations (9.4 vs 12.6 days; p = 0.021) ( Busse et al 2001 ). In the 28-week study by Sol\u00e8r e t al (N = 546), asthma exacerbat ions/patient, the primary endpoint, decreased more in the omalizumab group compared to placebo during both the stable steroid (0.28 vs 0.66; p < 0.001) and steroid reduction phases (0.36 vs 0.75; p < 0.001) ( Sol\u00e8r et al 2001 ). In the 32-week study by Holgate et al (N = 246), the percentage reduction in ICS dose, the primary endpoint, was greater among patients treated with omalizumab than among patie nts treated with placebo (median, 60 vs 50%; p = 0.003). The percentages of patients with 1 asthma exacerbatio n were similar between omalizumab and placebo groups during both the stable s teroid and steroid reduction pha ses (P value not reported). The absence of an observed treatment effect may be related to differences in the patient population compared with the first 2 studies, study sample size, o r other factors ( Holgate et al 2004). A meta-analysis of 3 of the pr eviously mentioned trials ( Busse et al 2001, Holgate et al 2004, Sol\u00e8r et al 2001 ) and their extension studies assessed the efficacy of omalizumab in a subg roup of 254 patients at high risk of serious asthma- related mortality and morbidity. P atients were defined as high-risk due to asthma histories that included the following: intubation history, emergency r oom visit within the last year, overnight hospitalization, or intensive care unit treatment. The primary outcome was an annua lized rate of acute exacerbatio n episodes based on data fr om the initial 16-week stable steroid phase for high-risk patients. Two kinds of acute exacerbation episodes were considered as endpoints: significant acute exacerbation episodes and all acute exacerbation episodes (ie, all episodes recorded by the investigator). Significant acute exacerbation episodes were def ined as those requiring a do ubling of baseline ICS dose (Busse et al 2001, Sol\u00e8r et al 2001 ) or use of systemic steroids ( all 3 studies). During the stabl e steroid phase, mean significant acute exacerbation episode rates were 1.56 and 0.69 /patient-year, respectively, a reduction of 56% with omalizumab (p = 0.007). Similar reductions in exacerbations in favor of omalizumab were obs erved for the whole study period and for all acute exacerbat ion episodes. The authors con cluded that 113 significant acute exacerbation episodes were prevented for every 100 pat ients treated with omalizumab for 1 year ( Holgate et al 2001). A Cochrane Review conducted in 2014 evaluated the efficacy of o malizumab in patients with a llergic asthma. Treatment with omalizumab was associated w ith a significant reduction in the odds of a patient having an asthma exacerbation (odds particip ants). This represents an absolute reduction from 26% for participants suffering an exacerbation on placebo to 16% on omalizumab, over 16 to 60 126 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 5 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Additionally, in patients with moderate to severe asthma and in those who were r eceiving background ICS therapy, treatment with omalizumab resulted in a significant re duction in the odds of havi ng an asthma exacerbation (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0 .42 to 0.6; 7 studies; 1889 participants). A significant benefit was noted for subcutaneous (SC) omalizumab vs placebo with regard to reducing hospitalizations (OR, 0.16, 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.42; 4 studies; 1824 participants), representing an abso lute reduction in risk from 3% with placebo to 0.5% with omalizumab over 28 to 60 weeks. The authors concluded tha t omalizumab was effective in r educing asthma exacerbations and hospitalizations as an adjunctive therapy to ICS and si gnificantly more effective t han placebo in increasing the numbers of participants who were able to reduce or withdraw their ICS. Omalizumab was gener ally well tolerated, although there were more injection site reactions with omalizumab. However, the clinical value of the reduction in steroid consu mption has to be considered in light of the high cost of omalizumab ( Normansell et al 2014 ). A systematic review of 8 random ized, placebo-controlled trials (N = 3429) evaluated the efficacy and safety of SC omalizumab as add-on therapy to corticosteroids in children and adults with moderate to severe allergic asthma. At the end of the steroid reduction phase, patients taking omalizumab were more likely to be able to withdraw corticosteroids completely compared with placebo (relative risk [RR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.28; p = 0.000 01). Omalizumab patients showed a decreased risk for asth ma exacerbations at the end of the stable (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0 .48 to 0.66; p = 0.0001) adjustable-steroid phases (RR, 0.47 to 0.64; p = 0.0001); post-hoc analysis suggests this effect was independent of duration of treatment, age, severity of asthma, and risk of bias. The frequency of serious adverse effects was similar between omalizumab (3.8%) and placebo (5.3%). Howev er, injection site reactions were more frequent in the omalizumab patient s (19.9 vs 13.2%). Omalizumab was not ass ociated with an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, cardiovascular effects, or malignant neoplasms ( Rodrigo et al 2011 ). In July 2016, the FDA expanded the indication of omalizumab to patients 6 to 11 years of a ge with moderate to severe persistent asthma. The approval was based primarily on a 52-wee k, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of omalizumab as add-on ther apy in 628 pediatric patients 6 to < 12 years of age with moderate to severe asthma inadequately controlled despite the use of an ICS ( Lanier et al 2009 ). Over the 24-week fixed-steroid phase, omalizumab reduced the ra te of clinically signific ant asthma exacerbations (worsening symptoms requiring doubling of baseline ICS dose and /or systemic steroids) by 31% vs placebo (0.45 vs 0.64; rate ratio, 0.69; p = 0. 007). Over a period of 52 weeks, the exacerbation rate was r educed by 43% (p < 0.001). Other efficacy variables such as n octurnal symptom scores, beta -agonist use, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) were not significantly differ ent in omalizumab-treated patien ts compared to placebo. A 2017 systematic review of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled tr ials and 5 observational st udies evaluated the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in children and adolescents. Omalizu mab reduced exacerbations compared with placebo or baseline in all studies that included this outcome. The randomized controlled trials did not identify significant differences in FEV 1; however, 3 of the 4 observational studies that included this outcome did find significant FEV 1 improvement with omalizumab. Generally, ICS and resc ue medication use were reduc ed with omalizumab in the studies. The authors concluded that the evidence strongly supports omalizumab safety and efficacy in pati ents 6 to 11 years (Corren et al 2017) . The EXCELS study was a multicent er, observational cohort study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and long-term safety of omalizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe allerg ic asthma. Patients were eva luated as part of 3 groups: non-omalizumab users, those newl y starting omalizumab, and thos e who were established user s at study initiation. Interim efficacy results demons trated that at month 24, the ACT score increased in all 3 pat ient groups: from 18.4 to 20 in non-omalizumab users, from 1 5.2 to 19.4 in those newly st arting on omalizumab, and from 18.2 to 19.4 in established omalizumab users. For patients newly starting omali zumab treatment, 54% achieved at least a minimally important difference, defined as a 3 point increase from base line in ACT. The study demonstrated that established users of omalizumab maintained asthma control during the study period ( Eisner et al 2012 ). To investigate the relationship between omalizumab and malignan t neoplasms, safety infor mation from the EXCELS trial was analyzed. Similar rates of primary malignancies in om alizumab- and non-omalizum ab-treated patients were found. However, study limitations preclude definitively ruling out a malignancy risk with omalizumab (Long et al 2014 ). A higher incidence of overall card iovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse ev ents was observed in omalizumab-treated patients comp patients ( Iribarren et al 2017 ). To further evaluate the risk, a pooled analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials was conducted. An increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events was not noted, but the l ow number of events, the yo ung patient population, and the short duration of follow- up prevent a definite conclusi on about the absence of a risk ( FDA 2014 ). 127 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 6 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients from the EXCELS study w ere eligible for the XPORT tria l, a 52-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the persistence of res ponse to omalizumab in patient s who discontinued omaliz umab therapy after long- term use. Patients were randomized to continue their omalizumab therapy or to omalizumab discontinuation. More patients who continued omalizum ab did not have an exacerbation compared to those who discontinued therapy (67.0% vs 47.7%; absolute differe nce, 19.3%; 95% CI, 5.0 to 33. 6). The authors concluded that continuation of omalizumab after long-term use results in sustained benefit (Ledford et al 2017) . Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria The safety and efficacy of omalizumab for the treatment of CIU was assessed in 2 placebo-controlled, multiple-dose clinical studies. Patients received omalizumab 75, 150, or 300 mg or placebo by SC injection every 4 weeks in addition to their baseline level of H 1 antihistamine therapy for 24 or 12 weeks, followed by a 16-wee k washout observation period. In both studies, patient s who received omalizumab 150 m g or 300 mg had greater decreases from baseline in weekly itch severity scores and weekly hive count scores than placebo at week 12. The 75 mg dose did not demonstrate consistent evidence of efficacy and is not approved for use ( Kaplan et al 2013, Maurer et al 2013 eval uated omalizumab add-on for 24 weeks in patients with CIU who remai ned symptomatic despite H 1 antihistamine therapy. Similar to previous studies, patients treated with omalizumab had signif icantly greater reductions in weekly itch severity score from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo (p 0.001) (Saini et al 2015 ). A meta-analysis of randomized ical trials evaluating omalizumab for the treatment of CIU was published in 2016. The analysis included 7 randomized, p lacebo-controlled studies with 1312 patients with CIU. Patients treated with omalizumab (75 to 600 mg every 4 weeks) had significantly reduc ed weekly itch and weekly wheal scores compared with the placebo group. The effects of omalizumab were dose dep endent, with the stro ngest reduction in weekly itch and weekly wheal scores observed wi th 300 mg. Rates of complete res ponse were significantly higher in the omalizumab group (p < 0.00001) and dose d ependent, with the highest rates in the 300 mg group. Rates o f patients with adverse events were similar in the oma lizumab and placebo groups ( Zhao et al 2016 ). A Phase 4 randomized clinical tria l evaluated the effect of oma lizumab in 205 patients with antihistamine-resistant CIU/chronic spontaneous urticari a. After an initial 24-week per iod of open-label treatment with omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, patients randomiz ed to continue omalizumab for a nother 24 weeks of double-blind therapy experienced a significantly lower rate of c linical worsening compared with patients randomized to double- blind placebo (21.0% vs 60.4%; p < 0.0001). No new safety signals were detected over th e 48-week omalizumab treatment period (Maurer et al 2018) . BENRALIZUMAB Asthma The safety and efficacy of benra lizumab were evaluated in a 52- week dose-ranging exacerbation trial, 3 confirmatory trials, and a 12-week lung function trial ( Bleecker et al 2016, Castro et al 2014, Fe rguson et al 2017, Fitzgerald et al 2016, Nair et 2017 ). In a randomized, controlled, doubl e-blind, dose-ranging Phase 2 b study, 324 adults with un controlled eosinophilic asthma were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 80), benralizumab 2 mg (n = 81), benralizumab 20 mg (n = 81), or benralizumab 100 mg (n = 82) and 285 adults with non-eosinophil ic asthma were randomized to benralizumab 100 mg (n = 142) or placebo (n = 143) ( Castro et al 2014 ). Treatments were given as 2 S C injections every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then every 8 weeks, for 1 year. Among adults with eosinophilic asthma, benralizumab 100 mg reduced exacerbation rates as com pared to placebo (0.34 vs 0.57 ; rate reduction, 41%; 80% C I, 11 to 60; p = 0.096). A significant reduction in exace rbation rates was not seen with benralizumab 2 mg or 20 mg as compared to placebo in these patients. In patients with a baseline blood eosinophil count of 300 cells/\u00b5L, exacerbation rates were lower than in the placebo group for the benralizumab 20 mg (0.30 vs 0 .68; rate reduction, 57%; 80% CI, 33 to 72; p = 0.015) and 100 mg (0.38 vs 0. 68; rate reduction, 43%; 80% CI, 18 to 60 ; p = 0.049) groups. SIROCCO was a randomized, multi center, double-blind, placebo-co ntrolled, 48-week, Phase 3 trial (N = 1205) involving patients with severe asthma with eosinophilia uncontr olled with high-do se ICS and LABAs ( Bleecker et al 2016 ). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 407 ), benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (n = 400), or benralizumab 30 mg every 8 w eeks (n = 398). Compared with pl acebo, benralizumab reduced the annual asthma exacerbation rate over 48 weeks w hen administered every 4 weeks (rate ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.71; p < 0.0001) or every 8 weeks (rate r atio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.6 4; p < 0.0001). Both doses of benralizumab also 128 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 7 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Asthma symptoms were improv ed with benralizumab every 8 weeks, but not every 4 weeks, as comp ared to placebo. CALIMA was a randomized, multicenter, as add-on therapy (to high-do se ICS and LABA) for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma and elevated blood eos inophil counts ( Fitzgerald et al 2016 ). A total of 1306 patients were randomly assigned to benralizumab 30 mg every 4 wee ks (n = 425), benralizumab 30 mg every 8 weeks (n = 441 ) or placebo (n = 440). When compared to placebo, significant reductions in annual exac erbation rates were seen with benralizumab every 4 weeks (rate ratio, 0.64; 95% C I, 0.49 to 0.85; p = 0.0018) and every 8 weeks (rate ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.95; p = 0.0188). Benralizumab was also associated with significantly improved pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 and total asthma symptom scores vs placebo. Patients enrolled in the SIROCCO and CALIMA trials who complete d treatment were eligible for the BORO Phase 3 safety extension trial. This was a randomized, double-blind stu dy that randomized patients to received benralizumab 30 mg every 4 or 8 weeks. Adult patients received treatment for 52 weeks and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) were treated for 108 weeks. A total of 1576 patients were inclu ded in the full-analysis set w ith safety assessed at 56 weeks. Treatment discontinuation due to any adverse event occurred in approximately 2% of patients in each group. The most common adverse events were viral upper respiratory tra ct infections and worsening asthma. Serious adverse events included worsening asthma (3% in the every-8-wee k dosing group and 4% i n the every-4-week dosing group), pneumonia (< 1% in both groups) and pneumonia ca used by bacterial infection (< 1% in the every-4- week dosing group and 1% in the every-8-week dosing group). New malignancy occurred in 12 (1%) of the 1,576 patients. Hypersensitivity rela ted to treatment occurred in 3 p atients. For the secondary e fficacy outcome, patients with elevated blood eosinophil levels had similar exacerbation rates to that observed durin g the first year of treatment in the SIROCCO and CALIMA trials ( Busse et Phase 3 trial that evaluated benralizumab therapy for patients with mild to moderate persist ent asthma ( Ferguson et al 2017 ). Patients (N = 211) had been receiving either low- to medium-dose ICS or low-dose ICS plus LABA therapy and were randomized to benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (n = 106) or placebo (n = 105). Benralizumab resulted in an 80 mL (95% CI, 0 to 150; p = 0.04) greater improvem ent in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 after 12 weeks as compared to placebo. Despite this improvement, this lung function re sult does not w arrant the use of benralizumab in mild to moderate asthma because it did not reach the minimum clin ically important improvement o f multicenter, double-blind, placebo-cont rolled, 28-week trial t hat primarily assessed whether or not benralizumab was effective as an oral glucocorticoid-sparing therapy in pat ients on oral steroids to manage severe asthma asso ciated with eosinophilia (Nair et al 2017 ). Of the enrolled patients, 220 were randomly assigned to benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (n = 72), benraliz umab 30 mg every 8 weeks (n = 73), or placebo (n = 75). Results revealed that t he 2 benralizumab dosing regimens significantly reduced the median final oral glucocorticoid doses from basel ine by 75% vs a 25% reduction se en with placebo (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Additionally, benralizumab adminis tered every 4 weeks resulted in an annual exacerbation rate that was 55% lower than that seen with placebo (marg inal rate, 0.83 vs 1.83; p = 0 .003) and benralizumab administered every 8 weeks resulted in a 70% lower rate than that seen with placebo (margi nal rate, 0.54 to 1 .83; p < 0.001). Fitzgerald et al conducted a st udy exploring the efficacy of be nralizumab for patients with different baseline blood eosinophil thresholds and exacer bation histories. This study wa s a pooled analysis (n = 2295 patients) of the results from the SIROCCO and CALIMA phase 3 studies. The annual exacerb ation rate among patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of 0 cells/L was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.2 8) in patients who received pl acebo vs 0.75 (0.66 to 0.84) in patients who received benralizumab every 8 weeks (RR, 0.64; 0.55 to 0.75; p < 0.0001). In patients who received benralizumab every 4 weeks who h ad eosinophil counts of 0 cells/L, the annual exacerbati on rate was 0.73 (0.65 to 0.82); RR vs placebo wa s 0.63 (0.54 to 0.74; p < 0.0001). The extent to which exacerbation rates were reduced increased with increasing blood eosinophil thresholds and with greater exacerbation history in patients in the every-4- week and every-8-week benralizumab groups. Greater improvements in the annual exacerbation rate were seen with benralizumab compared with place bo for patients with a combination of high blood eosinophil thresholds and a history of more frequent exacerbations (FitzGerald et al 2018). A 2017 meta-analysis evaluated t he therapeutic efficacy and saf ety of benralizumab in pat ients with eosinophilic asthma. A total of 7 articles (n = 2321) met the inclusion crit eria of the systematic review. T he pooled analysis found that benralizumab significantly reduced exacerbations (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.76; p < 0.000 01) compared to placebo. There was no statistical tr end for improvement in FEV 1 or asthma control indices such a s Quality of Life Assessment (AQLQ) and Asthma Control Ques tionnaire score in benralizumab-t reated patients. In addition, s afety data indicated that 129 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 8 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

MEPOLIZUMAB Asthma The safety and efficacy of were evaluated in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized controlled trials in adolescen t and adult patients with severe refractory asthma and signs of eosinophilic inflammation. Generally, patients were eligible for enrollment in the trials if they had eosinophils 150 ce lls/L in the peripheral blood at screening or 300 cells/L a t some time during the previous year. Patients also were re quired to be on a high-dose ICS as well as another controller medication ( Bel et al 2014, Ortega et al 2014, Pavord et al 2012 ). DREAM was a dose-ranging, 52-we ek, Phase 2b/3 study (N = 621) t hat compared annual asthma exacerbation frequency and improvements in c linical symptoms between patient s receiving 75 mg , 250 mg, and 750 mg intravenous (IV) mepolizumab and placebo . Mepolizumab decreased clinically significant exacerbation rates across all doses compared to placebo, at a rate of 2.40 per patient per year in the placebo group, 1.24 in the 75 mg mepolizumab group (p < 0.0001), 1.46 in the 250 mg mepolizumab group (p = 0.0005), and 1.15 in the 750 mg mepolizumab group (p < 0.0001). No significant improvements wer e found for secondary clinical symptom measures, which included change in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline, or change in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores (Pavord et al 2012) . MENSA was a 32-week Phase 3 trial (N = 576) that compared annua l asthma exacerbation frequency and improvements in clinical symptom s between patients receiving SC and IV mepolizumab vs placebo. Patients were selected on the basis of frequent exacerbat ions, treatment with high doses of ICS, and a defined blood eosinophil count. Both SC and IV mepolizumab significantly decreased clini cally significant exacerbation rates compared to placebo, at a rate of 1.74 per pat ient per year in the placebo group, 0.93 per patient per y ear in the IV mepolizumab group (p < 0.001), and 0.83 per patient per year in the SC mepo lizumab group (p < 0.001 ). In both the SC and IV mepolizumab-treated groups, the ACQ scores met thresholds for m inimal clinically important change and were significantly improved compared to placebo (p < 0.001) (Ortega et al 2014) . SIRIUS was a 24-week Phase 3 tria l (N = 135) that compared oral corticosteroid require ments between patients receiving SC mepolizumab and placebo . The likelihood of a reduction in the daily oral glucocorticoid dose was 2.39 times higher in the mepolizumab group (95% CI, 1.25 to 4.56; p = 0.008). The median redu ction in daily oral corticosteroid dose was 50% ( 95% CI, 20 to 75) in the mepolizum ab-treated group compar ed to 0% (95% CI, -20 to 33.3) in the placebo group (p = 0.007) (Bel et al 2014) . A post-hoc analysis of data from DREAM and MENSA was conducted to assess the relationship between baseline blood eosinophil counts and efficacy of mepolizumab. Of 1192 patients , 846 received mepolizumab and 346 received placebo. The overall rate of mean exacerbat ions per person per year was reduced from 1.91 with placebo to 1.01 with mepolizumab (47% reduction; r ate ratio, 0.53; p < 0.0001). The exacerbation rate reduction with mepolizumab vs placebo increased progressively from 52% (r ate ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.58) in patients with a baseline blood eosinophil count o f 150 cells/L to 70% (rate ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.40) in patients with a baseline count of 500 cells/L . At a baseline count < 150 cel ls/L, predicted efficacy o f mepolizumab was reduced. The authors concluded that the use of a baseline blood eosinoph il count will help to select pat ients who are likely to achieve important asthma outcomes with mepolizumab (Ortega et al 2016 ). COSMOS was a 52-week, open-label extension study in patients wh o received mepolizumab or placebo in MENSA or SIRIUS. Patients received SC m epolizumab regardless of prior treatment allocation and continued to receive appropriate standa rd-of-care asthma th erapy throughout. In tota l, 558 previous mepolizumab: placebo: 94 (14%; previous p lacebo: 36) patients ex perienced on-treatment adverse events and seri ous adverse events, respectively. No fat al adverse events or instances of mepolizumab-related anaphylaxis were reported. Mepo lizumab treatment was shown to exert a durable response, with patients who previously received mepolizumab i n MENSA or SIRIUS maintaining reductions in exacerbation rate and oral corticosteroid dosing throughout C OSMOS. Patients who previousl y received placebo in MENSA or SIRIUS demonstrated improvements in these endpoints following treatmen with mepolizumab ( Lugogo et al 2016 ). COLUMBA was an open-label extension study of patients enrolled in the DREAM trial who received mepolizumab 100 mg every 4 weeks plus standard of care until criterion for disc ontinuation was met (safety prof ile not positive for patient, patient withdrawn by their physi cian, patient withdrew consent, or drug became commercially available). There were 347 patients enrolled who received treatment for a mean of 3.5 years. Adverse events mos t frequently reported were 130 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 9 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Although 6 deaths occurred, none were considered related to study treatment. No a naphylaxis reactions were reported. Malignancy was reported in 2% (n = 6) of patients. The exacerbation rate for patients on treatment for 156 weeks or longer was 0.74 events/year, which was a 56% red uction from the off-treatment p eriod between the 2 studies ( Khatri et al 2018 ). A systematic review and meta-ana lysis compared hospitalization or hospitalization and/or emergency room visit rates in patients with severe eosinoph ilic asthma treated with mepolizum ab or placebo in addition to standard of care for 24 weeks. Four studies (N = 1388) were eligible for inclusion. Mepolizumab significantly reduced the rate of exacerbations requiring hospital ization (relative rate, 0.49; 9 5% CI, 0.30 to 0.80; p = 0.004) and hospitalization/emergency room vis it (relative rate, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.73; p < 0.001 ) vs placebo. Significant reductions of 45% and 38% were a lso observed for the proportion of patients experiencing 1 or more hospitalization and hospitalization and/or emergency room vi sit, respectively ( Yancey et the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab as add-on therapy (to glucoc orticoid treatment, with or without immunosuppressive therapy) for patients with rel apsing or refractory EGPA ( Wechsler et al 2017 ). A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to mepolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks (n = 68) or placeb o (n = 68). Results demon strated the following for the mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively: Percentage of patients with 24 weeks of accrued remission: 28 % vs 3% (OR, 5.91; 95% CI, 2.68 to 13.03; p < 0.001). Percentage of patients in remis sion at both week 36 and week 48 : 32% vs 3% (OR, 16.74; 95% CI, 3.61 to 77.56; p < 0.001). Annualized relapse rate: 1.14 vs 2 (rate ratio, 95% CI , 0.36 to 0.70; p < 0.001). Percentage of patients able to r educe their daily dose of conco mitant prednisone or prednisolone to 4 mg or less (average of weeks 48 to 52): 44% vs 7% (OR, p < RESLIZUMAB Asthma The safety and efficacy of resli evaluated in 4 doubl e-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized controlled trials. In all 4 studies , patients were required to be on at least a medium-dose ICS with or without additional controller medications ( Bjermer et al 2016, Castro et al 2015, Corren et al 2016). Studies 3082 and 3083 were 52-week studies (N = 953) in patient s with asthma who were required to have a blood eosinophil count 400 cells/L, and 1 asthma exacerbation re quiring systemic corticost eroid use over the past 12 months. These studies compared t he asthma exacerbation rate and improvements in clinical symptoms between patients receiving reslizumab 3 mg/kg IV administered once ever y 4 weeks and placebo. In b oth studies, patients receiving reslizumab had a significant reduction in the frequency of asthma exacerbations (Study 3082: rate ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.67; Study 3083: rate ratio, 0.41; 95% C I, 0.28 to 0.59; both p < 0.0001) compared with those receiving placebo. In both tr ials, an improvement in FEV 1 was evident for reslizumab vs placebo by the first on- treatment assessment at week 4, whi ch was sustained through wee k 52. Reslizumab treatm ent also resulted in significant improvements compar ed with placebo in AQLQ total score, ACQ-7 score, and As thma Symptom Utility Index (ASUI) score ( Castro et al 2015 ). Study 3081 was a 16-wee k study (N = 315) in patients who were r equired to have a blood eosinophil count 400 cells/L. The study compared the change from baseline in FEV 1 and improvements in clinical symptoms between reslizumab 3 mg/kg vs placebo. Reslizumab 3 mg/kg significantly improved FEV 1 (difference vs placebo: 160 mL; 95% CI, 60 to 259; p = 0.0018). Res lizumab also statistically s ignificantly improved ACQ and AQLQ; however, the minimally important difference was only reached for AQLQ (Bjermer et al 2016 ). Study 3084 was a 16-week study in 496 patient s unselected for baseline blood eosinophil levels (approximately 80% of patients had a screening blood eosinophil count < 400 ce lls/L). Patients were not allowed to be on maintenance oral corticosteroi ds. The study compared the change from baseline in FEV 1 and improvements in clinical symptoms between resliz umab 3 mg/kg vs placebo. In the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophils < 400 cells/L, patients treated wi th reslizumab showed no significant improvement in FEV 1 compared with placebo. In the subgroup with eosinophils 400 cells/L, however, treat ment with reslizumab was associated with much larger improvements in FEV 1, ACQ, and rescue SABA use compared with placebo (Corren et al 2016 ). An open-label, non-randomized ex tension study of these placebo- controlled trials continued treatment of patients with eosinophilic asthma with reslizum ab 3 mg/kg every 4 weeks for u p to 24 months to assess the drug's safety.

A to tal of 1051 patients were inc luded (n = 480 reslizumab- naive and n = 571 reslizumab-tr eated patients). Of these, 740 p atients received treatment for 12 months or longer and 249 patients received treatment fo r 24 months or longer. Worsen ing asthma and nasopharyngitis were the most common adverse events. Serious adv erse events occurred in 7% of patients and treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event occurred in 2% of patients. No deaths (n = 3) wer e related to treatment. Malignancy occurred in 15 (1%) of patients. Patients previously on reslizumab maintained asthma control and those naive to treatment demonstrated improvement in asthma control and lung function. T he authors concluded tha t reslizumab maintained asthma control for up to 2 years in patients with moderate-to-s evere eosinophilic asthma ( Murphy of 5 randomized controlled trials comparin g reslizumab to placebo (N = 1366) revealed improvements in exacerbations, FEV 1, and ACQ score with reslizumab.

FEV 1 also improved with reslizumab compared to placebo (mean difference, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.2 3; p < 0.00001). Finally, ACQ score improved with reslizumab compared to placebo (mean difference, -0.26; 95% CI, -0.36 to -0.16; p < 0.0000 1). All studies included in the meta-analysis were of limit ed duration of 15 or 16 weeks ( Li et al 2017 ). DUPILUMAB AD The efficacy and safety of dupilumab compared to placebo in adu lts with moderate-to-sever e AD was evaluated in two Phase 3 trials, SOLO 1 (n = 671) and SOLO 2 (n = 708). Adults w ho did not have an adequate response to topical treatments were included. Patients were randomized to either pl acebo, dupilumab 300 mg SC weekly or every other week for 16 weeks. The proportion of patients with an Investiga tor's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 (indicating clear or almost clear skin) and a reduction of 2 points or more in the score from baseline at week 16 was the primary outcome. In both studies between 36% and 38% of p atients who re ceived either regimen o f dupilumab achieved the primary outcome compared to 8% to 10% of patients who received placebo (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Significantly more patients who re ceived dupilumab had 75% improvement from baseline on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) compared to those who received placebo (p < 0.001). P ruritus and quality of life measures were also significantly improved with dup ilumab. The most common adverse effects with dupilumab compared to placebo were conjunctivitis and injection-site reactions ( Simpson et al 2016). The long-term efficacy and safet y of dupilumab was compared to placebo in 740 patients wi th moderate to severe AD not adequately controlled with topi cal corticosteroids in the L IBERTY AD CHRONOS study. P atients received either dupilumab 300 mg once weekly, onc e every 2 weeks, or placebo fo r 52 weeks. The co-pri mary endpoints were proportion of patients achieving an IGA score of 0 or 1 and 2 point improvement from baseline and EASI-75 at week 16. At week 16, 39% of patients in both dupilumab groups achiev ed an IGA score of 0 or 1 co mpared to 12% of patients who received placebo. EASI-75 was achieved in 64% and 69% of th e dupilumab groups vs 23% i n the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Similar efficacy resul ts were reported at week 52. A t 1 year, the most common ad verse events associated with dupilumab were injection-si te reactions and conjunctivitis . Localized herpes while herpes zoster and eczema herpeticum was more common the placebo group ( Blauvelt et al 2017 ). The efficacy of dupilumab compared to placebo was evaluated in 251 patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to- severe AD in a double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Patients < 60 kg received dupilumab 400 mg initially then 200 mg every 2 wee ks and patients 60 kg receiv ed 600 mg initially then 300 mg every 2 weeks for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint (pro portion of patients achieving an IGA score of 0 or 1 and 2 point improvement from baseline to week 16) was achiev ed in 24% of dupilumab patients compared to 2% of placebo patients. EASI-75 was achieved by 42% of dupilumab and 8% of placebo patients the efficacy in patients 12 years of age with moderate-to-se vere asthma uncontrolled with a medium-to-high dose ICS plus up to 2 additional controller medications (LABA and/or leukotriene receptor antago nist). Approximately 1900 pa tients were randomized to add-on therapy with dupilumab (2 00 mg or 300 mg every 2 weeks) or matching placebo for 52 weeks. The annual rate of severe exacerbations during the 52-week study period and the absolute change in FEV 1 at week 12 were the primary endpoints. A subgroup analysis o f patients with an elevated blo od eosinophil count of 300/mm3 was also planned. Both doses of dupilumab resulted in a reduced rate (46% and 47.7%, respectively) of asthma exacerbation compared to placebo (p < 0.0001). Patients wi th higher blood eosinophil lev els had greater than 65% reduction in the annual 132 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 11 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The change in FEV 1 was also significantly imp roved with both doses of dupilumab compared to placebo and even more pronounced in patie nts with elevated blood eo sinophil levels. Adverse events more common with dupilumab compared to placebo included injection-site reactions and eosinophilia ( Castro et al 2018 ). A total of 210 patients 12 year s of age with oral glucocorticoid-dependent severe asthma were randomized to receive add-on therapy with dupilumab 300 mg or placebo every other wee k for 24 weeks. Glucocorticoid doses were tapered from week 4 to week 20 and then maintained at a stable dose for 4 weeks. The percentage in glucocorticoid dose reduction at week 24 was the pr imary outcome. The percentage ch ange in glucocorticoid dose was -70.1% with dupilumab vs -41.9% with placebo (p < 0.001). A dose reduction of 50% was observed in 80% of dupilumab-treated patients compared to 50% of place bo patients. Almost 70% of pat ients in the dupilumab group achieved a glucocorticoid dose of less than 5 mg compared to 33% in patients who received placebo. The exacerbation rate was 59% lower with dupilumab compared to placebo. Inje ction site reactions and eos inophilia were more common with dupilumab compared to placebo ( Rabe et al 2018 ). A meta-analysis and systematic r eview of 4 RCTs evaluated the s afety and efficacy of dupilumab compared to placebo in approximately 3000 patients with uncontrolled asthma. The ra te of severe asthma exacerb ation was significantly reduced with dupilum ab compared to placebo (RR 0.44; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.055; p < 0.01). FEV 1 was also significantly increased with dupilumab with a mean difference of 0.14 L (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.17; p < 0.01) . With respect to adverse events, the risk of injection sit e reactions was higher with du pilumab compared to placebo (RR 1.91; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.59; p < 0.01) ( Zayed et al 2018 ). COMPARATIVE REVIEWS In 2017, Cockle et al conducted a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison to a ssess the comparative effectiveness and tolerability of mepolizumab and omalizumab, a s add-on therapy to standard of care, in patients with severe asthma. Studies included in the primary analysis were do uble-blind, randomized cont rolled trials, 12 weeks' duration enrolling patients with severe asthma with a documente d exacerbation history and receiving a high-dose ICS plus 1 additional controller. Two populations were examined: p atients potentially eligible for 1) both treatments (overlap population) and 2) either treatment (trial population) ( Cockle et al 2017 ). For the overlap population, no difference was found between mep olizumab and omalizumab. However, trends in favor of mepolizumab were observed, wit h median estimated rate ratios of 0.66 (95% credible inte rval [CrI], 0.37 to 1.19) for of clinically signi ficant exacerbations and 0.19 ( 95% CrI, 0.02 to 2.32) for t he rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalization. Results of the trial population analysis showed that mepolizuma b was associated with an estimated median rate ratio of 0.63 (95% CrI, 0.45 to 0.89) corresponding to a reduction of 37% in the rate of clinically significant exacerbations vs omalizumab. No difference bet ween treatments was observed fo r the rate of exacerbations resulting in hospitalization; however, the median rate ratio of 0.58 (95% CrI, 0.16 to 2.13) demonstrate d a trend for mepolizumab over omalizumab. Both treatments had broadly comp arable effects on lung function , and similar tolerability profiles. Another 2017 systematic review was unable to detect differences in efficacy when comparing add-on therapy with mepolizumab or omalizumab in ast hma patients who were not well controlled on ICS therapy. The analysis included both randomized controlled trials and cohort studies with durat ion of 12 weeks. A total of 18 omalizumab studies (N = 4854) and 4 mepolizumab studies (N = 1620) were included. Netwo rk meta-analysis did not find a significant difference in FEV 1 between groups (mean difference, 9.3 mL in favor of mepolizuma b; 95% CI, -67.7 to 86. 3). Both omalizumab and mepolizumab reduced the annualized rates of asthma exacerbations by approximately 50% compared with placebo. Although the authors were unable to identify significant differ ences in efficacy there was high heterogeneity among the clinical trials and major differe nces in study inclusion criter ia (Nachef et al 2018) . A systematic review of the IL-5 antagonists, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab, included 13 studies (N = 6000) conducted in patients with asthma poorly controlled by IC S. The majority of patients had severe eosinophilic asthma. All of the IL-5 antagonist s reduced asthma exacerbation s by approximately 50% and improved FEV 1 by 0.08 L to 0.11 L. Overall, there was not an increase in serious advers e events with any IL-5 antagonist; however, more patients discontinued benralizumab (36/159 9) than placebo (9/998) due to adverse events (Farne et al 2017) . A 2019 network meta-analysis of 11 studies aimed to indirectly compare the efficacy (n = 1855) and safety (n = 3462) of reslizumab with benralizumab in patients with eosinophilic asth ma. The efficacy analysis compared a benralizumab subgroup with blood eosinophils 300 cells/\u00b5L (n = 1537) to a reslizumab subgroup in GINA step 4/5 with 2 or more 133 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 12 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Re slizumab was found to have significantly greater improvement in the ACQ and AQLQ scores compared to benralizumab. No significant difference between the groups was observed in clinical asthma exacerbation, but a sensitivity analysis with the overall study population suggested a significantly greater reduction in exacerbations with reslizuma b. There were fewer discontinuations due to adverse events with reslizumab; however, the frequency and types of adv erse events were not signifi cantly different between treatment groups (Casale et al 2019). A 2019 network meta-analysis of 11 studies compared efficacy of licensed doses of mepoliz umab, benralizumab, and reslizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma based on eosinophil levels. Mepolizumab reduced clinically significant exacerbations compared to benralizumab for patients with blood eosinophils 150 cells/\u00b5L (rate ratio, 0.66; 95% (rate ratio, 95% CI , 0.37 to 0.99), and 400 cells/\u00b5 L (rate ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.87) and with mepolizumab compared to reslizumab for p atients with blood eosinophils cells/\u00b5L (rate ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.85). Additionally, change from b aseline in ACQ score was greater with mepolizumab compared to benralizumab in pati ents with -0. 36; 95% CI, -0.66 to -0.05) and eosinophils cells/\u00b5L (difference, -0.39; 95% CI, - 0.66 to -0.12). There was no difference between reslizumab and benralizumab in clinically si gnificant exacerbations or ACQ scores in patients with blood eosinophils 400 cells/\u00b5L (Busse et al 2019) . Additional meta-analyses have no t found significant differences in asthma exacerbation rates between mepolizumab and reslizumab or between benralizumab and mepolizumab (Bourdin et al 2018, Henriksen et al 2018). The magnitude of treatment effec t biologic asthma was evaluated in a network meta-analysis. The outco mes evaluated were change in FEV 1, ACQ score and AQLQ score. Event rates for asthma exacerbation and associated rate ratios were determined for each drug. A total of 26 studies were included in the analysis (n = 7 benralizumab, n = 2 dupilumab, n = 4 lebrik izumab, n = 7 mepolizumab, n = 4 reslizumab, n = 2 tralokinumab) with a total of 8444 patients (n = 4406 on active treatment, n = 4038 in contr ol groups). The duration of treatment ranged from 12 to 56 weeks. Increase in FEV 1, reduction in ACQ score and increase in AQLQ score was observed with all treatments exc ept tralokinumab. Compared to p lacebo, the greatest FEV 1 increase was with dupilumab (0.16 L; 95% CI, resli zumab (0.13 L; 95% CI, 0.10 and ralizumab (0.12 L; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.17). Mepolizumab and le brikizumab both had an increas e of 0.09 L (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.15 with mepolizumab, 0.04 to 0.15 with lebrikizumab). Reduction in ACQ score (indica ting better asthma control) i n order of greatest to least reduction was mepolizumab, dupilu mab, benralizumab, and reslizumab. The investigational agents had the least impact on the ACQ score. Quality of lif e scores were similarly increas ed with the 4 agents while the investigational agents had the least impact on quality of life. Compared to placebo, the calculated rate ratio for annu alized asthma exacerbation was significant only for dupilu mab (rate ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0 .17 to 0.80) and reslizumab (rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.78). Comparisons between tr eatments did not show any signi ficant difference for change in FEV 1, asthma control or quality of life except for super iority of mepolizumab to the 2 investigational agents in ACQ score reduction ( Iftikhar et al 2018 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Asthma According to guidelines from the NHLBI/National Asthma Educatio n and Prevention Program, pharmacologic therapy is based on a stepwise approach in which medications are increased until asthma is contro lled and then decreased when possible to minimize side effect s of treatments. The level of a sthma control is based on ( NHLBI 2007 ): Reported symptoms over the past 2 to 4 weeks Current level of lung function (FEV 1 and FEV 1/forced vital capacity [FVC] values) Number exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids per year . The NHLBI guidelines state that o malizumab is used as adjunctiv e therapy in patients 12 years and older who have allergies and severe persisten t asthma that is not adequately c ontrolled with the combination of high-dose ICS and LABA therapy (NHLBI 2007 ). In 2019, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) published updated guidelines for asthma management and prevention. In April 2019, GINA updated a gui deline on diagnosis and manage ment of difficult-to-treat and severe asthma. Criteria for establishing a diagnosis of s evere asthma was included, whi ch requires multiple interventions before a diagnosis can be made. For patients with a di agnosis of severe asthma, uncont rolled on Step 4 treatment (eg , 2 or more controllers or 134 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 13 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Treatment with a biologic agent should be considered in patients who are uncontrolled despite a high dose ICS/LABA or need maint enance oral corticosteroids . Anti-IgE treatment with omalizumab is recommended for pat ients 6 years of age with severe allergic asthma. Similarly, add-on anti-IL-5 therapy (ie, benralizumab, mepolizumab) is recommended for pati ents 12 years of age or r eslizumab for patients 18 years of age with severe eosin ophilic asthma. Anti-IL4 receptor therapy (ie, dupilumab) is recommended for patients 12 years of age with severe eosinophilic/Type 2 asthma or patie nts taking oral corticosteroid s. Prior to initiation of these agents, several factors are recommended to consider including c ost, insurance eligibility crit eria, evaluation of predictors of response, delivery the Americ an Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, and the Join t Council of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology recommend a stepwise treatment approach for CIU. Treatment with omalizumab is recommended in p atients inadequately controlled with antihistamines and a leukotriene receptor antagonist (Bernstein et al 2014 ). Joint guidelines by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinica l Immunology, the Global Alle rgy and Asthma European Network, the European Dermatolog y Forum, and the World Allergy Organization recommend treatment with omalizumab in patients with symptoms despi te treatment with a 4-fold dose of modern second generation antihistamines. This is a change from previous guidelines in which use of either omalizum ab or cyclosporine afte r failure of high-dose antihistamines was recommended. However, due to adverse effects and the lack of an appr oved indication, the new recommendation was that cyclospor ine should only be considered if omalizumab does not provide an adequate response. ( Zuberbier et al 2018 ). Recent guidelines published by t he British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology similarly recommend omalizumab as a potential second-line agent in patients inadequately controlled on a 4-fold dose of a n on-sedating antihistamine (Powell et al 2015). Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with the EGPA (Churg-Strauss) Con sensus Task Force recommendati ons and the American Society for Apheresis guideline recommend glucocorticoi ds alone for patients without life- and/or organ-threatening EGPA. patients with life- , both glucocorticoids and a n immunosuppressant are recommended, as well as maintenance therapy with azathioprine or methotrexate. IVIG can be considered for refracto ry EGPA or for treatment during pregnancy ( Groh et al 2015, Schwartz et al 2016 ). These guidelines have not been updated to include the place in therapy for mepolizumab; however, the EGPA Consensus Task Force recommen dations notes that mepolizumab hol d promise for this condition based on the pilot studies available at the time of guideline development ( Groh et al 2015 ). AD According to the American Academy of Dermatology, interventions that provide effective control of AD for a majority of patients include non-pharmac ologic interventions with emollients, topical treatment with corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, and avoidance of environmental triggers . Phototherapy is the next opti on for children and adults with moderate to severe AD not c ontrolled with the first-line i nterventions. A third-line treatment recommended for patients who fail photot herapy is treatment with systemic immunomodulators, such as cyclosporine and methotrexate. The guidelines did not provide a recommendation on use of biologic agents due to limited data available at the time of publication ( Sidbury et al 2014 ) 2017 guidance from the International Eczema Council provides clinicians with similar guidance as the American Academy of Dermatology as well as additional steps to be taken before initiation of systemic treatment. These include consideration of an alternative diagnosis, ensuring patient com pliance with topical treatmen t, a trial of intensive topical therapy, treatment of infection, i dentification and avoidance of all potential triggers, and use of phototherapy if possible. The guidance does not comment on use of biologic agen ts due to limited data ( Simpson et al 2017 ). The International Eczema Council al so published a position statement on conjunctivitis in at opic dermatitis with and without dupilumab therapy based on an opinion survey and round table discussion of its members. Based on expert opinion, a consensus was reached that patients should be inform ed about possible conjunctiv itis with dupilumab prior 135 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 14 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A 2018 European consensus guideline from a variety of organizations on treatment of atopic eczema includes dupilumab as a treatment option for patients with moderate-to-s evere disease in whom an adequate response is not achieved with topical treatments and for whom other systemic tr eatments are not available. Concomitant use of emollients is recommended and co mbination with topical agents may be needed. No specific information on use of pediatrics was provided due to lack of data. ( Wollenberg et al 2018 ). SAFETY SUMMARY All agents are contraindicated in patients with a history of hy persensitivity to the specific agent or excipients in its formulation. Abrupt discontinuation of syste mic, topical or inhaled corticos teroids is not recommended when treatment with any of these agents are init iated. If appropriate, the corticosteroid dosage should be reduced gradually. Cinqair: Boxed warning: Anaphylaxis has been observed with Cinqair infus ion in 0.3% of patients in p lacebo-controlled clinical studies. Anaphylaxis was reported as early as the second dose o f Cinqair. Patients should be observed for an appropriate period of time after Cinqair administration by a healthcare professional prepared to manage anaphylaxis. Key warnings and precautions: In placebo-controlled clinical s tudies, 6/1028 (0.6%) patients receiving 3 mg/kg neoplasm reported compared to 2/730 (0.3% ) patients in the placebo group . The observed malignancies in Cinqair-treated patients were diverse in nature and without clustering of any p articular tissue type. Pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before thera py with Cinqair. If patients become infected while receiving Cinqair and do not res pond to anti-helminth treatment , Cinqair should be discontinued until the parasitic infection resolves. The most common adverse reacti on ( occurred after administration of Dupixent. Dupixent should be discontinued in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. For patients with AD, conjunctivitis and keratitis has occurred more often when compared to placebo in clinical trials evaluating Dupixent. N ew or worsening eye s ymptoms should be re ported to a healthcare provider. For patients with asthma, cases of eosinophilic pneumonia and v asculitis consistent wit h EGPA have been reported. Occurrence of vasculitic rash, wor sening pulmonary symptoms, an d/or neuropathy, especially upon reduction of oral corticosteroids should be monitored. Pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before thera py with Dupixent. If a patien t becomes infected while receiving Dupixent and does not r espond to anti-helminth treatment, Dupixent should be discontinued until the parasitic infection resolves. Most common adverse reactions i n patients with AD included inje ction site reactions, other herpes simplex virus infection, and dry eye. Most common adverse reactions i n patients with asthma included injection site reactions, oropharyngeal pain, and eosinophilia. Fasenra: after administration of Fasenra. Fasenra should be discontinued in the event of a hyper sensitivity reaction. Pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before thera py with Fasenra. If patients become infected while receiving Fasenra and do not res pond to anti-helminth treatment , Fasenra should be discontinued until the parasitic infection resolves. The most common adverse reactio ns ( 5%) included headache and pharyngitis. 136 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 15 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Vaccination should be considered if clinically appropriate. Pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before thera py with Nucala. If patients become infected while receiving Nucala and do not res pond to anti-helminth treatment, Nucala should be discontin ued until the parasitic infection resolves. The most common adverse reactio ns ( 5%) included headache, inj ection site of the throat or tongue, has been report ed. Patients should be observe d closely for an a ppropriate period of time after Xolair administration. Health care providers administering Xolair shou ld be prepared to manage an aphylaxis that can be life- threatening. Patients with a prior history o f anaphylactic reactions to othe r causes may be at an incr eased risk for anaphylaxis. The frequency of anaphylaxis is reported to be between 0.1 to 0.2% and may occur immediat ely or up to a year post- treatment. Key warnings and precautions: Malignant neoplasms were observ ed in a higher rate of Xolair-tr eated patients (0.5%) than control patients (0.2%) in clinical trials. A subsequent 5-y ear observational cohort study found similar rates of primary malignancies in Xolair- and non-Xolair-treated patients. H owever, study limitations pre clude definitively ruling out a malignancy risk with Xolair ( Long et al 2014 ). Rarely, patients on therapy with Xolair may present with seriou s systemic eosinophilia, w hich may present with features of vasculitis consisten t with Churg-Strauss syndrome. These events usually have been associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Some patients have re ported signs and symptoms simila r to serum sickness, including arthriti s/arthralgia, rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. Adverse reactions in asthma st udies: In patients 12 years of age, the most commonly obse rved adverse reactions in clinical studies ( 1% in Xola ir-treated patient s and more frequently than reported with plac ebo) were arthralgia, pain (general), leg pain, fatigue, di zziness, fracture, arm pain, pruritus, dermatitis, and earac he. In clinical studies with pediatric patients 6 to < 12 years of age, the most common adve rse reactions were nasopharyngitis, headache, pyrexia, upper abdominal pain, streptococc al pharyngitis, otitis media, viral gastroenteritis, arthropod bites, and epistaxis. Adverse reactions in CIU studies : Adverse reactions from 3 plac ebo-controlled, multiple-dose CIU studies that occurred in 2% of patients receiving Xolair and more frequently than i n those receiving placebo included arthralgia, cough, headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea , sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and viral upper respiratory tract infection. Cardiovascular and ce rebrovascular events in asthma studies: In a 5-year observational cohor t study, a higher incidence of overall cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events was observed in Xolai r-treated patients compared to non-Xolair-treated patients. T o further evaluate the risk, a pooled analysis of 25 randomized , controlled, clinical trials was conducted. An increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrov ascular serious adverse events was not noted, but the low number of events, the young patient population, and the sho rt duration of follow-up prev ent a definite conclusion about the absence of a risk ( FDA 2014 ).

Safety and efficacy in pe diatric patients with CIU < 12 years o f age have not been established. See the current prescribing information for full details. CONCLUSION Xolair is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is FDA-approved for patients 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlle d with an ICS. Xolair has been shown to decrease the incidence of asthma exacerbations in these patients. Although clinical trial results have been mixed and several trials had an open-labe l design, there is some evidence to indicate that Xolair may decrease asthma-related emergency visi ts and hospitalizations, as well as decreasing the dose of ICS and rescue medication and in creasing sympto m-free days ( Buhl et al 2002, Busse et al 2011, Holgate et al 2004, Lanier et al 2003, Sol\u00e8r et al 2011 ). 138 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 17 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Xolair is administered SC in a physician's office every 2 to 4 weeks in a dose that is det ermined by body weight and the levels of serum IgE. Xolair carries a boxed warning due to the risk of anaphylaxis, and thus must be administered under medical supervision. Although Xolair therapy is generally safe, analysis of a 5-year , observational cohort, epidemi ological study (EXCELS) showed an increased number of c ardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events in pati ents receiving Xolair compared to placebo ( Iribarren et al 2017 ). However, a pooled analysis of 25 randomized, double-blind, p lacebo- controlled clinical trials did not find notable imbalances in t he rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events ( FDA 2014 ). Asthma guidelines generally reco mmend Xolair therapy in patients with severe allergic a sthma that is inadequately controlled with a combinati on ). Based on the limited place in therapy and t he need for administration under medical supervision, Xolair is appropriate for a small percentage of pati ents with asthma. Xolair received FDA-approval fo r the treatment of adults and ad olescents (12 years of a ge and above) with CIU who remain symptomatic despite H 1-antihistamine treatment. Two ran domized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated its efficacy in reducing weekly itc h severity scores and weekly hiv e count scores significantly greater than placebo at week 12. Xolair was well-tolerated, w ith a safety profile similar to that observed in asthma patient s. In patients with CIU, Xolair is dosed at 150 or 300 mg SC every 4 weeks in a physician's off ice. Guidelines for the tr eatment of CIU recommend treatment with Xolair in patients who are inadequately controll ed with a 4-fold dose o f modern second generation antihistamines. Although previous guidelines suggested the use of omalizumab after a leukot riene receptor antagonist, the most recent guideline from t he European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Networ k, the European Dermatology Forum, and th e World Allergy Organi zation state that a recommendation regarding use of a leukotriene receptor antagoni st cannot be made due to a low level of evidence. Additionally, use of Xolair is r ecommended before treatment wit h cyclosporine ( Bernstein et al 2014, Zuberbier et al 2018, Powell et al 2015 ). Cinqair, Fasenra, and Nucala are IL-5 antagonists approved as a dd-on treatment options fo r patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, with demons trated effectiveness in reducin g asthma exacerbations ( Bel et al 2014, Bjermer et al 2016, Castro et al 2015, Corren et al 2016, Pavord et al 2012, Ortega et al 2014, Bleecker et al 2016, Fitzgerald et al 2016 ). The mechanism of action of Fas enra is slightly different, in that it binds to the IL-5 rec eptor on immune effector cells, whereas Cinqair and Nucala bind to the IL-5 cytokine. Al l of these agents provide a more targeted treatment option for patients with severe, refra ctory asthma and should be consi dered in those with an eosinophilic phenotype uncontrolled on conventional asthm a therapy after confirmation of severe disease, along with individual patient factors (GINA 2019a, GINA 2019b 2 FDA-approved indica tions: treatment of patients 12 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD, and treat ment of patients 12 years of age with severe asthma of t he eosinophilic type or dependent on oral corticosteroids. Its use in AD should be determined by its approved indication and clinician judgment. According to the most recent G INA guideline on treatment of severe asthma, the use of Dupixent for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype can be considered for patients with severe eosinophilic/Type 2 asth ma or patients taking oral corticosteroids. Nucala is the only IL-5 antagoni st approved for the treatment of adult patients with EGPA. There are no head-to-head trials comparing Cinqair, Fasenra, Du pixent and Nucala. However, a systematic review of the IL-5 antagonists conducted in patients with asthma poorly c ontrolled by ICS revealed tha t all of the IL-5 antagonists reduced asthma exacerbations by approximately 50% and improved FEV 1 by 0.08 L to 0.11 L. O verall, there was not an increase in serious adverse ev ents with any IL-5 antagonist; however, more patients di scontinued benralizumab (36/1599) than placebo (9/998) due to adverse events (Farne et al 2017). A network meta-analysis of IL-4, IL-5 and IL- 13 antagonists demonstrated t hat all agents reduced FEV 1 and improved ACQ and AQLQ scores, except for the investigational agent, tralokinumab. The only 2 agents that dem onstrated a significant reduction in asthma exacerbation rates compared to placebo were reslizumab and dupilumab ( Iftikhar et Fasenra , Cinqair does have several limitations, including: an indica tion for patients 18 years of age (vs 12 years of age with Nucala and Fasenra), IV admin istration (SC for Nucala Fasenra), and a boxed warning for anaphylaxis. Dupixent is indicated for treatment of patients 12 year s of age with both severe asthma and AD. 139 Data as of June 10, 2019 PH-U/MG-U/ALS Page 18 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Therapeutic Class Overview Anticonvulsants INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a disease of the brai n defined by any of the follow ing (Fisher et al 2014 ): At least 2 unprovoked (or reflex ) seizures occurring > 24 hours apart; 1 unprovoked (or ref lex) seizure and a probability of further s eizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after 2 unprovoked seizures , occurring over the next 10 ye ars; Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Types of seizures include generali zed seizures, focal (partial) seizures, and status epilepticus ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2018, Epilepsy Foundation 2016 ). Generalized seizures affect both sides of the brain and include : Tonic-clonic (grand mal): begin with stiffening of the limbs, f ollowed by jerking of the limbs and face Myoclonic: characterized by r apid, brief contractions of body m uscles, usually on both sides of the body at the same time Atonic: characterized by abrupt l oss of muscle tone; they are a lso called drop attacks or akinetic seizures and can result in injury due to falls Absence (petit mal): character ized by brief lapses of awareness , sometimes with staring, that begin and end abruptly; they are more common in children than adults and may be accompanied by brief myoclonic jerking of the eyelids or facial muscles, a loss of muscle tone, or automa tisms. Focal seizures are located in ju st 1 area of the brain and incl ude: Simple: affect a small part of t he brain; can affect movement, sensations, and emotion, without a loss of consciousness Complex: affect a larger area o f the brain than simple focal se izures and the patient loses awareness; episodes typically begin with a blank sta re, followed by chewing movemen ts, picking at or fumbling with clothing, mumbling, and performing repeat ed unorganized movements or wand ering; they may also be called \"temporal lobe epilepsy\" or \"psychomotor epilepsy\" Secondarily generalized seizures : begin in 1 part of the brain and spread to both sides Status epilepticus is characterized by pro longed, uninterrupted seizure activity. Seizure classifications from the International League against E pilepsy (ILAE) were updated in 2017. The ILAE classification of seizure types is based on whether the seizure has a focal, generalized, or unknown onset; has a motor or non-motor onset; and whether the patient is aware or has imp aired awareness during the event (for focal seizures). Additional classification de tails may also be used ( Fisher et al 2017A, Fisher et al 2017B ). There is variation between the IL AE classifications and many of the Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA)-approved indications for antiepileptic d rugs (AEDs). For e xample, a \"foc al aware\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"simple partial seizure,\" and a \"focal i mpaired awareness \" seizure corr esponds to the prior term \" complex partial seizure.\" A number of epilepsy syndromes hav e also been described; these are defined by groups of f eatures that tend to occur together such as having a simila r seizure type, age of onset, p art of the brain involved, and electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern ( Epilepsy Foundation 2013). An example is a childhood epi lepsy syndrome called Lennox-Ga staut syndrome (LGS), which is charac terized by several seizure types including tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. In LGS, there is a classic EEG pattern seen and intellectual de velopment is usually impaired ( Epilepsy Foundation 2014 ). Epilepsy management is focused on the goals of 1) controlling s eizures, 2) avoiding treatme nt-related adverse effects (AEs), and 3) maintaining or r estoring quality of life. Managem ent options vary based on the seizure type. It is usually appropriate to refer patients to a neurologist to establish the epilepsy diagnosis and formulate the management strategy (Schachter 2019 ). A correct diagnosis is essential to proper treatment selection. For example, absence seizures are commonly confused with complex partial seizures. H owever, drugs that reduce absen ce seizures are generally ineffective for complex partial seizures, and the most e ffective drugs for complex part ial seizures may be ineffect ive against or even increase the frequency of absence seizures (Epilepsy Foundation 2016). 148 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 2 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred t reatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased pati ent adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. When combination therapy is needed, it is recommended to select prod ucts with different mechanisms of action and AE profiles. There is little compar ative clinical data to support the use of specific combinations ( Schachter et al 2019 ). Several broad classes of AEDs ar e available, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, hydantoins, and miscellaneous agents (see Table 1). Cannibidiol (Epidiolex) was FDA- approved in June 2018 for use i n pediatric patient s 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018 ). It is the first FDA-approved d rug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purifie d substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. Cannabidiol is a schedule V controlled substance ( Epidiolex prescribing information 2018). Stiripentol (Diacomit) capsules and powder for oral suspension were FDA-approved in August 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet s yndrome in pati ents 2 years of age and older taking clobazam. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) recei ved an expanded indication in A pril 2018 for use in partial- onset seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) . This product is a kinase inh ibitor that also has several oncology indications. Midazolam nasal spray (Nayzilam) was approved in May 2019 for t he acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age (Nayzilam prescribing information 2019 ). Several of the AEDs are used fo r additional indications beyond the management of epilepsy, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and several types o f neuropathic pain. These additi onal indications are listed in Table 2; however, this review primarily focuses on the use o f AEDs for the management of epilepsy. Additionally, brands and formulations FDA-appr oved and marketed only for non- epilepsy indications are not included within this review; these include gabapentin t ablets (Gralise), FDA-approve extended-relea of postherpetic neuralgia and treatment of moderate-to-sever e restless leg syndrome, and pregabalin extended-release tablets (Lyrica CR), FDA- approved only for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral bar biturate hypnotics Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Overall, the anticonvulsants hav e demonstrated efficacy for the ir FDA-approved uses. Clinic al trial data demonstrating efficacy of the anticonvulsants fo r the treatment of epilepsy is described in the prescribing in formation for the individual products, particularly for anti convulsants more recently approv ed by the FDA. However, the pr escribing information for some older, products (eg, phenobarbital) do not contain efficacy data in their prescribing information. No single AED is clearly the mo st effective. Comparative effica cy data for the management of epilepsy are limited, and trials have generally not shown significant differences among d rugs in terms of efficacy. H owever, the quality of the data is limited and generally derived from short-term trials ( Karceski 2019 ). When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred t reatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased pati ent adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. (Schachter et al 2019 ). Most patients with epilepsy are treated with anticonvulsant monotherapy ( Nevitt et al 2017 ). An evidence review summarized AED efficacy and effectiveness as initial monotherapy for epileptic seizures and syndromes (Glauser et al 2013 ). This publication provides con clusions based on a review of 6 4 randomized trials and 11 meta-analyses. Conclusions include the following: As initial monotherapy for adults poten tially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or un treated partial-onset As initial monotherapy for elder ly adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial-onset seizures: Gabapentin and lamotrigine entially efficacious/effective. As initial for adults aggravate genera lized-onset tonic-clonic seizures. For children with newly diagnose t tonic-clonic seizures: are efficacious/effective. 156 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 10 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Oxcarbazepine is potentially efficacious/effective. and phenytoin may genera lized-onset tonic-clonic seizures. As initial monotherapy for child ren with newly diagnosed or unt reated absence seizures: Ethosuximide and valproate are Lamotrigine tiagabi ne, and vigabatrin ma y precipitate or aggravate absence seizures (based on scattered reports). As initial monotherapy for children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes Carbamazepine (not ailable in the United St ates) are potentially efficacious/effective. For patients with newly diagnosed myoclonic, and in some c ases generalized tonic-clonic seizures. There has also been a report that lamotrigine may exacerbate seizures in JME. There is a lack of well-designed randomized trials in epilepsy, particularly for generalized seizures and in the pediatric population. A Cochrane systematic review evaluated the efficacy of AED monotherapy for epilepsy ( Nevitt et al 2017 ). treatment of partial onset seizures (simpl e partial, complex partial or secondarily generalized) or genera lized tonic-clonic seizures w ith or without other gener alized seizure types. This network meta-analysis show ed that for the primary outcome, the time to withdrawal o f allocated treatment: For individuals with partial sei zures, levetiracetam performed better than carbamazepine and lamotrigine; lamotrigine performed better t han all other treatments (aside f rom levetiracetam); and carbamazepine performed better than gabapentin and phenobarbital. For individuals with generalized onset seizures, v alproate perf ormed better than carbamazepine, topiramate and phenobarbital. For both partial and generalized onset seizures, phenobarbital seems to perform worse than all other treatments. For the secondary outcome , time to first seizure: For individuals with partial seizures, phenobarbital performed better than both carbamazepine and lamotrigine; carbamazepine performed better t han valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine; and phenytoin performed better than lamotrigine. For both partial and generalized seizure types, phenytoin and p henobarbital generally performed better than other treatments. Few notable differences were show n for either partial or genera lized seizure types for the secondary outcomes of time to 6-month or 12-month remission of seizures. Overall, direct evidence and netwo rk meta-analysis estimates were numerically similar, and effect sizes had overlapping confidence intervals. Data for individuals with general ized seizures are still limite d and additional randomized trials are needed. The generalized (n = 7 studies ) or absence seizures (n = 3 studies) was evaluated in a systematic review and network meta-analysis (Campos et al 2018 ). The outcomes analyzed were seizure freedom and withdrawal due to inefficacy. Compared to valproate, phenytoin had a lower odds of seizure freedom (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% credible Interval [CrI] 0.27 to gene ralized tonic-clonic seizures . Lamotrigine had the highest probability of seizure freedom and valproate had the highest pr obability of withdrawal due to inefficacy in these patients. For absence seizures, ethosuximid e and valproate were found to have a higher probability of seizure freedom compared to lamotrigine. A meta-analysis estimated the co mparative efficacy of achieving seizure freedom with 22 antiepileptic drugs and placebo in children and adolescents ( Rosati et al 2018 ). For the treatment of newly di agnosed focal epilepsy (n = 4 studies), point estimates suggest ed superiority of carbamazepin e and lamotrigine; however, th is was not statistically 157 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 11 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

For refractory foca l epilepsy (n = 9 studies), lev etiracetam and perampanel were more effective than placebo in mixed comparisons. Ethosuximid e and valproic acid were more effective than lamotrigine for absence seizures. The authors concluded that better designed comparative studies with appropriate lengt h of follow-up, well-defined outcomes, and reliable inclusion criteria a re needed to validate these re sults. Approximately 20% to 40% of patients with epilepsy can be consi dered refractory to drug treat ment, referred to as drug- resistant epilepsy. Treatment o f drug-resistant epilepsy may in clude additional anticonvulsant drug trials, epilepsy surgery, vagal nerve stimulation , and dietary changes (the ketogenic diet) ( Sirven 2018 ). Combination AED regimens are an option for the treatment of dru g-resistant epilepsy. However, robust clinical evidence of suitable combinatio ns of AEDs has been difficult to generate due to the large number of possible combinations of drugs and doses. Examples of combinations for which there is some evidence of efficacy include valproate plus lamotrigine for partial-onset and generalized seizures, valproate plus ethosuximide for absence seizures, and lamotrigine plus t opiramate for various seizure t ypes; however, even this evi dence is fairly limited. In general, when considering combination therapy, it is recommende d to combine medications with different mechanisms of action, and to be mindful of the overall drug load to minimize AEs. Two-drug therapy should be attempted before considering addition of a third drug, and high er numbers of drugs shoul d be avoided as they are associated with a very low lik elihood of additional seizure red uction ( Kwan et al 2011 ). A as adjuncti ve therapy for uncontrolled par tial-onset seizures. Most patients in this meta-analysis were on at least 2 other AED s at the time of treatment. In this analysis, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and brivaracetam were non-inferior to levetiracetam in terms of eff icacy, but all newer AEDs except brivaracetam had worse tolerability pr ofiles than levetirace tam at high doses ( Zhu et al 2017 ). A network meta-analysis examined t he parti while using monotherapy ( Zhao et al 2017 ). The efficacy outcomes studied were 50% responder rate and st ate of seizure freedom. The authors co ncluded that topiramate, levetiracetam, pregabalin, and oxcarbazepi ne were preferable for their relatively high efficacy and low risk of AEs. Rufinamide was the least preferable medication due to its low efficacy and high risk of AEs. A network meta-analysis was conduc ted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 newer AEDs for treatm ent of refractory partial- onset epilepsy with or with out secondary generalization ( Hu et al 2018 ). The primary outcome was seizure freedom, which was defined as a 100% seizure reduction in the maintenanc e or double-blind treatmen t period of the trial. Safety was assessed by the wit hdrawal rate due to treatment-eme rgent AEs. Based on resu lts of 54 studies that evaluated the efficacy outcome , the most effective agents inclu ded tiagabine, brivaracetam, and valproic acid, and the least effective agents included ru finamide, lamotrigine, and zonisamide. Products with favorable safety included levetiracetam, brivaracetam, and perampanel, while those with the least favorable safety included retigabine (not available in the United States) , oxcarbazepine, and rufinamide. The authors stated that agents with the best outcomes in terms of efficacy and safety included levetiracetam, vigabatrin, valproic ac id, and brivaracetam. Cannibidiol (Epidiolex) was roved in June 2018 for use in pe diatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018 ). It is the first FDA-approved drug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purifie d substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. Its approval for these 2 indications w as based on 3 placebo-control led trials in patients refr actory to other treatments. Epidiolex, along with use of ot her agents, demonstrated a signi ficant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( Thiele et al 2018 ; Devinsky et al 2018; Devinsky et al 2017). To date, no comp arative trials have been published. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) recei ved an expanded indication fo r adjunctive use in TSC- associated partial-on set seizures in April 2018. Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 366 patients with inadequately cont rolled seizures on 2 or more AEDs demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( French et al 2016 ). In August 2018, the FDA approved a second drug, stiripentol (Di acomit), for use in the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Two multicenter placebo-contro lled studies evaluated the addition of stiripentol to clobazam and valproate therapy i n patients 3 years to less than 18 years of age with Dr avet syndrome. Responder rates (seizure frequency reduced by 50%) with respect to genera lized tonic-clonic seizures were significantly lower with stiripentol compared to placebo ( Diacomit prescribing information 2018). 158 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 12 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In May 2019, a nasal spray formul ation of midazolam (Nayzilam) was approved for the acut e treatment of cluster seizures in adults and adolesc ents. In one randomized controlle d trial in patients with seizu re clusters while receiving a stable AED regimen, the proporti on of patients who experience d treatment success (seizure termination within 10 minutes and no recurrence for t he next 6 hours) was significantly higher with midazolam nasal spray compared to placebo (53.7% vs = 0.0109) with si milar tolerability (Detyniecki et al 2019 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Efficacy and tolerability of the n ew antiepileptic drugs I: treatment of new-onset epilepsy . American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( French et al 2004A, Kanner et al, 2018A ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guideline focuses on treatment of new -onset epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs. The 2004 publication summ arizes the efficacy, acetam, and zonisamide for the treatment of children and adults with newly diagnosed partial and ge neralized epilepsies. The recommendations from the 2004 gu ideline include the following: Patients with newly diagnosed ep ilepsy who require treatment can be initially treated with standard AEDs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate. Choice will depend on individual patient characteristics. Lamotrigine can be included in the options for children with ne wly diagnosed absence seizures. The 2018 recommendations include the following : As monotherapy in adult patients with new-onset focal epilepsy or unclassified generalized tonic-clonic seizures: Lamotrigine use be consid ered Lamotrigine use should be consid ered and gabapentin use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency in patients aged 60 years. Levetiracetam and zonisamide use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Vigabatrin appears to be less efficacious than carbamazepine i mmediate-release and ma y not be offered; furthermore, the toxicity profile precludes vigabatrin use as first-line therapy. Pregabalin 150 mg per day is possibly less efficacious than lamotrigine 100 mg per day. There is insufficient evidence to consider use of gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate over carbamazepine. There is insufficient evidence to consider use of topiramate i nstead of phenytoin in ur gent treatment of new- onset or recurrent foca l epilepsy, unclassif ied generalized ton ic-clonic seizures, or generalized epilepsy presenting with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Data are lacking to support or refute use epilepsy. Data are lacking to support or r efute use of newer AEDs in treating unclassified generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide or valproic acid s hould be considered before lamot rigine to decrease seizure frequency in children with absence epilepsy . An exception would be if there are compelling AE-related concerns with use of ethosuximide or valproic acid. The guideline does not address newly approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Efficacy and tolerability of the drugs II: tr eatment of refractory epilepsy . American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Kanner et al 2018B , French et al 2004B ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guidelin e focuses on management of tr eatment-resistant epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs. The 2004 publicat ion summarizes the efficacy, and adults with refractory partial and gen eralized epilepsies. Recommendations from the 2004 guideline include the following: It is appropriate to use gabapent in, piramate, oxcarbazepine, patients with refractory epilep sy. 159 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 13 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and lamotrigine can be used as monot herapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Topiramate may be used for the treatment of refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and children. Gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbaz epine, and topiramate may be u sed as adjunctive treatment of children with refractory partial seizures. Topiramate and lamotrigine may be used to treat drop attacks as sociated with LGS in adults and children. Recommendations from the 2018 guideline include the following: As adjunctive therapy in patient s with treatment-resistant adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE): Immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel are established as effective to seizure frequency. Lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended-release topiramate s hould be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Vigabatrin and rufinamide are e ffective for decreasing seizure frequency, but are not first-line agents. Ezogabine (no longer marketed) u se should be considered to reduce seizure frequency, but carries a serious risk of skin and retinal discoloration. Clobazam and extended-release o xcarbazepine may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. As monotherapy in patients with TRAFE: Eslicarbazepine use may be cons idered to decrease seizure freq uency. Data are insufficient to recommend use of second- and the othe r third-generation AEDs. For add-on therapy for generalized epilepsy, immediate-release and extended-release lamotrigine should be considered as add-on therapy to decrease seizure frequency in a dults with treatment-resistant generalized tonic-clonic seizures secondary to generalized epilepsy. Leveti racetam use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency as add-on ther apy for treatment-resistant gen eralized tonic-clonic seizures and for treatment-resistant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Rufinamide is effective to reduce seizure frequency as add-on t herapy for LGS. Clobazam use should be considered as add-on therapy for LGS. For add-on therapy in pediatric patients with treatment-resista nt focal epilepsy: Levetiracetam use should be cons idered to decrease seizure fre quency (ages 1 mont h to 16 years). Zonisamide use should be considered to decrease seizure freque ncy (age 6 to 17 years). Oxcarbazepine use should be cons idered to decrease seizure fre quency (age 1 month to 4 years). Data are unavailable on the effi cacy vigabatrin. The does not approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first sei zure in adults. Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Ameri can Epilepsy Society ( Krumholz et al 2015; reaffirmed in 2018 ). This practice guideline makes re commendations based on a consid eration of the eviden ce for prognosis and treatment of adults with an unprovoked first seizure. Recommendations include the following: Adults presenting with an unpr ovoked first seizure should be in formed that the chance for a recurrent seizure is greatest within the first 2 years after a first seizure (21% to 45%). Clinicians should also advise su ch patients that clinical facto rs associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence include a prior brain insult such as a stroke or tra uma, an EEG with epilept iform abnormalities, a significant brain-imaging abnorma a nocturnal seizure. Clinicians should advise pati ents that, although immediate AED therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likel y to reduce the risk of a seizure recurrence in the 2 years subsequent to a first seizure, it may not improve quality of life. Clinicians should advise patients that over the longer term (> 3 years), immediate AED treatment is unlikely to improve the prognosis for sust ained seizure remission. Patients should be advised tha t their risk for AED AEs ranges f rom 7% to 31% and that these AEs are predominantly mild and reversible. Immediate AED therapy after an unp rovoked first seizure is likely to reduce seizure recurrence risk. A reduction in risk may be important, particularly fo r adults, for whom seizure rec urrences may cause serious psychological and social consequences such as loss of d riving privileges and limitations on employment. However, immediate AED treatment 160 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 14 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Decisions should be based on weighing the risk of rec urrence against the AEs of AED therapy, and should take patient preferences into account. It is accepted that when a patient has a sec ond or additional s eizures, an AED should be ini tiated because the risk of subsequent seizures is very high. Evidence-based guideline: treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults. Guideline Committee of the American Epilepsy Society ( Glauser et al 2016 ). This publication provides conclu sions and a treatment algorithm based on a structured literature review of randomized trials of anticonvulsant treatment s for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes. A total of 38 trials were included. For treatment in the adult population, conclusions included the following: Intramuscular (IM) midazolam, intravenous (IV) lorazepam, IV di azepam (with or without phenytoin), and IV phenobarbital are established as efficacious at stopping seizur es lasting at least 5 minutes. IV lorazepam is more effective than IV phenytoin in stopping se izures lasting at least 10 minutes. There is no difference in effica cy between IV lorazepam followe d by IV phenytoin, IV diazepam plus phenytoin followed by IV lorazepam, and IV phenobarbital followed by IV phenytoin. IV valproic acid has similar e fficacy to IV phenytoin or contin uous IV diazepam as second therapy afte r failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in adults about the efficacy of levetir acetam as either initial or second therapy. In adults with status epilepticus without established IV access , IM midazolam is established as more effective compared with IV lorazepam. No significant difference in effectiveness has been demonstrate d between lorazepam and diazepam in adults with status epilepticus. For treatment in the pediatric population, conclusions included the following: IV lorazepam and IV diazepam are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Rectal diazepam, IM midazolam, i ntranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Insufficient data exist in children about the efficacy of intra nasal lorazepam, sublingual lorazepam, phe nytoin as initial therapy. IV valproic acid has similar effi cacy but better tolerability t han IV phenobarbital as sec ond therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in childr en regarding the efficacy of p henytoin or levetiracetam as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. In children with status epilept icus, no significant difference in effectiveness has been established between IV lorazepam and IV diazepam. In children with status epilepticus, non-IV midazolam (IM/intra nasal/buccal) is probably more effective than diazepam (IV/rectal). Conclusions included the following (age not specified): Insufficient data exist about the comparative efficacy of pheny toin and fosphenytoin. F osphenytoin is better tolerated compared with phenyto in. When both are available, fosphenytoin is preferred based on tolerability, but phenytoin is an acce ptable alternative. The overall treatment a lgorithm directs that: A benzodiazepine (IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, or IV diazepam) i s recommended as the initial therapy of choice in the first phase of tr eatment (5 to 20 minutes after t he beginning of the seizure). Although IV phenobarbital is established as e fficacious and well tolerated as initial therapy, its slower rate of administration positions it as an alternative in itial therapy. For prehospital settings or where first-line benzodiazepine options are not available, rectal diazepam, intranasal midazolam, and b uccal midazolam are reasonable initial therapy alternatives. In the second phase of treatment ( from 20 to 40 minutes after t he beginning of the seizur e), reasonable options include fosphenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. There is no clear evidence that any of these options is better than the others. Because of AEs, IV phenobarbital is a r easonable second-therapy alternative if none of the 3 recommended therapies are available. There is no clear evidence to guide therapy in the third phase of therapy ( 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure). 161 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 15 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurolo gy and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Go et al 2012 ; reaffirmed in 2018) This publication provides updat ed recommendations for the treatment of infantile spasms. The literature review included an evaluation of 26 publ ished articles on this topic. Recommendations include the following: Evidence is insufficient to reco mmend the use of prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone as being as effective as adrenocorti cotropic hormone (ACTH) for sh ort-term treatment of infantile spasms. Low-dose ACTH should be considered as an alternative to high-do se ACTH for treatment of infantile spasms. ACTH or vigabatrin may be offered for short-te rm treatment of i nfantile spasms; evidence suggests that ACTH may be offered over vigabatrin. Evidence is insufficient to rec ommend other therapies (valproic acid, vitamin B6, ketogenic diet, or novel/c ombination therapies) for treatment of infantile spasms. Hormonal therapy (ACTH or predni solone) may be considered for u se in preference to vi gabatrin in infants with cryptogenic infantile spasms, to possibly improv e developmental outcome. A shorter lag time to treatment of infantile spasms with either hormonal therapy or vigabatrin may be considered to improve long-term cognitive outcomes. There is a lack of sufficient r andomized trials to provide definitive answers to key questi ons related to treatment of infantile spams. Practice parameter: treatment o f the child with a first unprovo ked seizure. Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Hirtz et al 2003 ; reaffirmed in 2016) This parameter reviews publish ed literature relevant to the decision to begin treatment after a child or adolescent experiences a first unprovoked se izure and presents evidence-ba sed practice recommendations. Treatment during the neonatal period is not addressed. Recommendations include the following: Treatment with AEDs is not indica ted for the prevention of the development of epilepsy. Treatment with AEDs may be consi dered in circumstances where th e benefits of reducing the risk of a second seizure outweigh the risks of pharmacologic and psychosocial AE s. The majority of children who ex perience a first unprovoked seiz ure will have few or no recurrences. Treatment with AEDs after a first seizure as opp osed to after a second seizure has not been shown to imp rove prognosis for long- term seizure remission. Treatment has been shown in sev eral studies combining both chil dren and adults to reduce the risk of seizure recurrence; however, there is a r elative paucity of data from s tudies involving only child ren after a first seizure. Summary of recommendations for t he management of infantile seiz ures. Task force repo rt for the ILAE Commission of Pediatrics (Wilmshurst et al 2015 ). This publication recommends an approach to the standard and opt imal management of infants with seizures. When possible, recommendations are evidence-based; however, when no evidence was available, recommendations are based on expert opinion and standard practice. Recommendations/findings include the following: There is no indication for initiation of chronic AEDs for simpl e febrile seizures. However , in the acute treatment of febrile seizures, it is impor tant to treat seizures lasting 10 minutes or longer. In an otherwise healthy infant, a policy of \"wait and see\" is reasonable after the first afebrile seizure. However, this is a rare event and clos e monitoring is essential. Treatment options with establis hed or probable efficacy include the following: 162 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 16 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Dravet syndrome: clonazepam Provoked or situational seizures: carbamazepine There is no clear evidence supporting an optimal duration of tr eatment; this is dependent on seizure type. Guidelines on neonatal seizures . World Health Organization (WHO) ( WHO 2011). This document was prepared bas ed on a systematic review of the literature and involved co operation between the WHO, the ILAE, and the Internatio nal Bureau of Epilepsy (IBE). Recommendations include the following: Phenobarbital should be used as the first- line agent for treatm ent of neonatal seizures and should be made readily available in all settings. In neonates who continue to have se izures despite administering the maximum tolerated dose of phenobarbital, either a benzodi azepine, phenytoin, or lidocaine may be used as the second-line agent for control of seizures (use of pheny toin or lidocaine requires car diac monitoring). In neonates with a normal neurologi cal examination and/or normal EEG, stopping AEDs may be considered if the neonate has been se izure-free for > 72 hours; the drug(s) s hould be reinstituted i f seizures recur. In neonates in whom seizure contr ol is achieved with a single A ED, the drug can be di scontinued abruptly without tapering the do se. In neonates requiring > 1 AED for se izure control, the drug s may be stopped one at a time, with phenobarbital being t he last drug to be withdrawn. Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epi lepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence- based review): and perinatal outcomes. Quality Standards Subcommi ttee and Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommitt ee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009A ; reaffirmed in 2013; Update in progress) This publication summarizes evide nce for selected issues regard ing the clinical management of women with epilepsy (WWE) who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant. Recommendations include the following: If possible, avoidance of the us e of valproate as part of polyt herapy during the first tr imester of pregnancy should be considered to decreas e the risk of major congenital m alformations (MCMs). If possible, avoidance of the us e of valproate monotherapy duri ng the first trimester of pregnancy may be considered to decreas e the risk of MCMs. To reduce the risk of MCMs, the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided, if possible, compared to the use of carbamazepine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avo idance of the use of polytherapy with valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, should be considered, compared to polyt herapy without valproate. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avo idance of the use of valproate d uring the first trimes ter of pregnancy, if possible, may be considered, compared to the use of phenytoin o r lamotrigine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avo idance of the use of AED polythe rapy during the first trim ester of pregnancy, if possible, compared to monotherapy should be considered. Limiting the dosage of valproate or lamotrigine during the first trimester, if possible, should be considered to lessen the risk of MCMs. Avoidance of the use of valproat e, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and facial clefts, and may be con sidered to reduce the risk of hypospadias. Avoidance of phenytoin, carbamaz epine, and phenobarbital, if po ssible, may be consider ed to reduce the risk of specific MCMs: cleft palate for phenytoin use, posterior cle ft palate for carbamazepine use, and cardiac malformations for phenobarbital use. Carbamazepine exposure probably does not produce cognitive impa irment in offspring of WWE. Avoiding valproate in WWE duri ng pregnancy, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Avoiding phenytoin and phenobarbi tal in WWE during pregnancy, i f possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Monotherapy should be considered in place of polytherapy, if po ssible, for WWE who take AEDs during pregnancy to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possi ble, should be considered compared to carbamazepine to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. 163 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 17 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, may be considered compared to phenytoin to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Valproate has the most data show ing an association with risk from in utero exposure. If a c hange from valproate to another AED is planned, it is pr udent to make this change well before pregnancy. Although many of the reco mmendations in this parameter suggest minimizing AED exposure during pregnancy, for most WWE, discontinuing AEDs is not a reasonable or safe option . Discontinuing AEDs may expose the mother and fetus to physical injury from a ccidents due to seizure activity . Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epi lepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence- based review): vitamin K, folic acid, blood levels, and breastf eeding. Quality Standards Subcommittee and Therapeutics and Techno logy Assessment Subc ommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009B ; reaffirmed in 2013; U pdate in progress) This publication summarizes evide nce for selected issues regard ing the clinical management of WWE who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant. Recommendations include the following: The placenta may be factored into the clinical decision regarding the necessity of AED tr eatment for a woman with epile psy. Monitoring of lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin levels during pregnancy should be considered. Monitoring of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine (as monohydroxy d erivative) levels du ring pregnancy may be considered. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute a change in phenobarbital, valproate, primidone, or ethosuximide levels related to p regnancy, but this lack of evid ence should not discourage monitoring levels of these AEDs during pregnancy. Valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may not transfer into breast milk to as great an extent as primidone, levetiracetam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topir amate. Although many of the AEDs were shown to cross the placenta or e nter breast milk, studies were limited in duration and did not systematically eva luate neonatal symptoms. Guidelines also support the use of AEDs for several common non-epilepsy indications: The American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society state that AEDs with established efficacy for migraine prevention include valp roate, divalproex sodium, and t opiramate; carbamazepine is noted to be possibly effective ( Silberstein et al 2012; reaffirmed in 2015; Update in progress). The American Academy of Neurology, American Association of Neur omuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and American Academy of Physical Medi cine and Rehabi litation state that, for relief of painful diabetic neuropathy, pregabalin is established as effective, and gabapentin and valp roate are probably effective ( Bril et al 2011 ; Update in progress). The American Academy of Neurology states that gabapentin and pr egabalin are of benefit in reducing pain from postherpetic neuralgia ( Dubinsky et al 2004 ). American Psychiatric Associatio n guidelines describe the key ro le of AEDs in the management of bipolar disorder, including the following ( Hirschfeld et al 2002): First-line pharmacol ogical treatment for mo re severe manic or m ixed episodes is either lithium plus an antipsychotic or valproate plus an antipsychotic; for less ill patients, monotherapy with lithium, valproate, or an antipsychotic may be sufficient. F or mixed episodes, valproate may be preferred over lithium. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are alternatives. First-line pharmacol ogical treatment for bi polar depression is either lithium or lamotrigine. When an acute depressive episode of bipolar disorder does not respond to firs t-line medication treatment, the next steps include adding lamotrigine, bupropion, or paroxetine. The initial treatment for patient s who experience rapid cycling should include lithium or va lproate; an alternative is lamotrigine. The medications with the best e mpirical evidence to support the ir use in maintenance treatment include lithium and valproate; possible alternatives include lamotrigine, carba mazepine, or oxcarbazepine. 164 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 18 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Note: This guideline was publis hed in 2002 and cannot be assume d to be current; however, AEDs continue to be recommended for both acute (mania or hypomania) and maintena nce phases of bipolar disorder (Post 2017, Stovall 2018). SAFETY SUMMARY Tolerability and safety are as im portant as effi cacy in determi ning the overall effectivene ss of epilepsy treatment (Schachter 2019 ). Common AEs among AEDs in clude the ( Schachter 2019 ). tremor, anxiety, nervousness, insomnia aggression, irritability, hyperactivity depression, mood alteration confusion ataxia blurred or double vision Examples of rare but serious AEs include the following ( Schachter 2019, individual package inserts ): suicidal ideation and behavior (AEDs as a boxed warnings related to potentially se rious AEs; these include the following: Carbamazepine: Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including TEN and SJS, have been reported. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry hav e found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inhe rited allelic variant of the HLA -B gene. Patients with ancestry in genetically at-risk populations (across broa d areas of Asia) should be scre ened for the presence of HLA-B*1502 prior to initiating treatment with carbamazepine. Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported. If a pa tient exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient s hould be monitored closely, and discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depressio n develops. Clobazam, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, and midazolam: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in pr ofound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Concomitant prescribing should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative 165 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 19 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. treatment options are inadequat e, and patients should be follow ed for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Felbamate: Use is associated with a marked increase in the incidence of ap lastic anemia. Felbamate should only be used in patients whose epilepsy is s o severe that the risk of aplastic anemia is deemed acceptable. Routine blood testing cannot be reliably used to reduce the incidence of apla stic anemia, but it will in some cases allow detection of hematologic changes b efore the syndr ome declares i tself clinically. Felbamate should be discontinued if any evidence of bone marrow depression occurs. Cases of acute liver failure hav e been reported. Felbamate shou ld not be prescribed for anyone with a history of hepatic dysfunction. Treatmen t should be initiated only in individuals without active liver disease and with normal baseline serum transamina ses. It has not been proven that periodic serum transaminase testing will prevent serious injury, but it i s generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihoo d for recovery. Serum transaminases should be monitored at baseline and per iodically thereafter. Felbamate should be discontinued if either aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) become increased to 2 times the upper limit of normal, or if clinical signs and symptoms suggest liver failure , and should not be consid ered for retreatment. Fosphenytoin and phenytoin: There is a cardiovascu lar risk associated w ith rapid IV infusio n rates. The rate of administration should not exceed recommendations, and care ful cardiac monitoring is requi red. Lamotrigine: Cases of life-threatening seriou s skin rashes, including SJS and TEN, and/or rash-re lated death have been caused by lamotrigine. Benign rash es are also caused by lamotri gine; however, it is not possible to predict which rashes will prov e to be serious. Lam otrigine should be di scontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. Perampanel: Serious or life-threatening ps ychiatric and behavioral AEs aggression, hostilit y, irritability, anger, and homicidal ideation and threats hav e been reported. Patients sho uld be monitored for these reactions and for changes in mood, behavior, or personality. The dose should be reduced if these symptoms occur, and it should be discontinued if symptoms are severe or worsening. Valproic acid and divalproex sodium: Hepatotoxicity, including fata lities, have been reported, usually during the first 6 m onths of treatment. Serum liver tests are required and pati ents should be monitored close ly. There is a risk to fetuses exposed in utero, particularly neura l tube defects, other major malformations, and decreased intelligence quotient ( IQ). Valproate should not be given to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical conditio n, and women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Pancreatitis, including fatal hem orrhagic cases, has occurred. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting , and/or anorexia can be sympto ms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. Vigabatrin: Vigabatrin can cause permanent bila teral concentric visual fiel d constriction, including tunnel vision that can result in disability. In some cases, vigabatrin may also damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Baseline and periodic visi on assessment are recommended . However, this assessment cannot always prevent vision damage, and once detected, vision loss due to vigabatrin is not reversible. Vigabatrin should be withdrawn from patients who fail to show substantial clinical b enefit. Due to the risks of vision loss , vigabatrin is available only t hrough a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program ( FDA REMS 2019 ). Healthcare providers who pres cribe vigabatrin and pharmacies that dispense the product must be spec ially certified. Each patient must be enrolled in the REMS program. Prescribers must ensure that per iodic visual monitoring is performed and report any AE suggestive of vision loss to the an antineoplastic, immunosuppressant agent with several adverse reactions. The most common AE that occurred in trials for TSC-associated p artial-onset seizures was stomatitis. More serious AEs include: 166 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 20 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

These products vary in terms of t heir indications for specific seizure types and indications other than epilepsy. Overall, the anticonvulsants hav e demonstrated efficacy for the ir FDA-approved uses. Whe n possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Patients who are refractory to monotherapy may be treated with combination therapy. When considering combination therapy, it is recommended to combine medications with differen t mechanisms of action and AE profiles. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited. Tolerability and safety are as im portant as effi cacy in determi ning the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment. Both systemic AEs and neurologic AEs commonly occur. Some AEDs are a ssociated with rare but serious AEs, and careful patient selection and monitoring are required. Epilepsy management can be complex and is often performed by ne urologists. A variety of AEDs should be available to allow clinicians to select the most clinically appropriate agen t for individual patients. Anticonvulsants are also establis hed as effective for several non-epilepsy indications, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and neuropathic pain. 170 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 24 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

International Classification of Sleep (ICSD-3) diagno criteria for narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy with cataplexy) require: 1) Daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep (i.e., excessive daytime sleepines s) occurring for at least 3 months. 2) The presence of one or both of the following: catapl exy and a mean sleep 176latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes and 2 or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) on a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) performed usi ng standard techniques. A SOREMP (within 15 minutes of sleep onset) on the preceding nocturnal polysomnogram may replace 1 of the SOREMPs on the MSLT; or cere brospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 concentration is low (less than or equal to 110 pg/mL or less than one-third of mean values obtained in normal subjects with the same standardized assay) [2,3]. B. International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) diagn criteria for narcolepsy type 2 (narcolepsy without cataplexy) include: 1) Daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep (i.e., excessive daytime sle epiness) occurring for at least 3 months. 2) Cataplexy is absent. 3) CSF hypocretin-1 lev els, if measured, is either greater than 100 pg/mL or greater than one-third of mean values obtained in normal subjects with the same standardized assay. 4) A mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes and 2 or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREM Ps) on a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) performed using standard techniques. A SOREMP (within 15 minutes of sleep onset) on the preceding nocturnal polysomnogra m may replace 1 of the SOREMPs on the MSLT. 5) Hypersomnolence and/or MSLT findings ar e not better explained by other causes such as insufficient sleep, obstructi ve sleep apnea, delayed sleep phase disorder, or the effect of medication or substances or their withdrawal [2,3].

Therapeutic Class Overview Narcolepsy Agents INTRODUCTION Narcolepsy is a lifelong neurological sleep disorder of hyperso mnia characterized by exces sive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and intermittent manifesta tions of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during wakefulnes s. Excessive sleepiness is defined by the International Class ification of Sleep Disorders, third edition (ICSD-3) as \"daily episodes of an irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep\" ( Sateia 2014 ). Patients with narcolepsy often hav e many nighttime arousals and sleep disturbances that contribute to excessive drowsiness during the day. EDS c an vary in severity, and some p atients involuntarily fall as leep during normal daily activities. This can put the pati ent or others at risk if these daytime lapses into sleep occur during activities such as operating a motor vehicle. While all patients with narcolepsy e xperience EDS, additional symptoms may include cataplexy, which is the sudden an d complete loss of muscle tone , dream-like images or hallucinations at sleep onset or awakening, and sleep paralysis ( National Institute of Neurological Disord ers and Stroke [NINDS] 2017, Scammell typ e 1 and narcolepsy type 2. Pat ients are diagnosed with narcolepsy type 1 if they have 1 or both of the following: (1) a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 deficiency; (2) clear cataplexy and a mean sleep latenc y of < 8 minutes on the multip le sleep latency test (MSLT ) with evidence of 2 sleep- onset rapid-eye movement periods (SOREMPs), one of which may be seen on a preceding overnight polysomnogram. A diagnosis of narcolepsy type 2 al so requires a mean sleep laten cy of < 8 minutes on the MSLT and at least 2 SOREMPs, but cataplexy must be absent and CSF hypocretin-1 levels must not meet the type 1 criterion (Sateia 2014). Narcolepsy affects males and females equally. While symptoms typically begin to present in t he teens or early twenties, they can occur at any time th roughout a patients' life ( NINDS 2017, Scammell 2019 ). It is estimated that approximately 135,000 to 200,000 people in the Un ited States (US) are diagnos ed with narcolepsy; however, this number may actually be higher as many patients often go undiagnosed ( NINDS 2017). Narcolepsy is a chronic condition, but does not typically get worse over time. T here is no cure for narcolepsy but there are pharmacologi cal and nonpharmacological options that can be implemented to help patients manage their symptoms. The goal of therapy i s to mitigate symptoms in order to improve the pat ient's quality of life ( Morgenthaler et al 2007a, NINDS 2017 ). This review on promoting agents, modaf inil (Provigil) and armodafinil (Sunosi). T hese 4 medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the symptomatic treatment of narcole psy. There are several amphetamine-like stimulant medica tions indicated for the treatment of narcolepsy; howev er, they will not be covered in t his review. Modafinil and armodafinil (the l onger half-life R-enantiomer of modafinil) are both FDA-appro ved to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive s leepiness associated with nar colepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and shift work disorder (SWD). OSA is a sleep d isorder that is characterized b y obstructive apneas and hypopneas, causing patients to have frequent sleep interruptions due to increased respiratory effort. Often, patients do no t feel rested in the morning and continue to have ex cessive sleepiness throughout the day ( American Academy of Sleep Medicine [AASM] 2009, Strohl 2019 ). SWD is a circadian rhythm sle ep disorder that occurs in indi viduals who work non-traditional hours and is characterized by excessive sleepiness and/or insomnia ( Morgenthaler et al 2007b ). Modafinil armodafinil have been shown to produce psychoactive and euphoric effects similar to C NS stimulants, as well as alterations in mood, perception, thinking and feelin gs. As a result, these agents ar e classified as Schedule IV controlled substances. Sodium oxybate is gamma-hydroxy butyric acid (GHB), a known drug of abuse. It is FDA-approv ed for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in patients 7 years of age with narcolepsy and is classified as a Sc hedule III controlled substance for these indications. However, non-medical uses of sodium oxyb ate are classified under Schedule I. Sodium oxybate carries a boxed warning regardi ng CNS depression, abuse, and mi suse, and may only be dispens ed to patients enrolled in the Xyrem Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program using a specially certified pharmacy. Prescribers and patients must also be enrol led in this REMS program ( Xyrem REMS Web site). Solriamfetol is FDA-approved to improve wakefulness in adult pa tients with EDS associated with narcolepsy or OSA. Solriamfetol is pending U.S. Cont rolled Substances Act scheduli ng (Sunosi dossier 2019 ). 180 Data as of April 30, 2019 JD/CME Page 2 of 9 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

While placebo-controlled (PC) cli nical studies document the eff icacy of these agents, the exact mechanisms of action are not completely understood. He ad-to-head studies are limited, and current clinical guidelines recommend modafinil and sodium oxybate as first-line tr Stimulants - mi sc.; Anti-cataplectic agents. Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Narcolepsy The efficacy of modafinil for EDS associated with narcolepsy wa s established in 2 multicenter (MC), double-blind (DB), PC, randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In both studies, patients treated with modafinil showed statistically significant improvement in objective measures of excessive sleepiness as me asured by the MSLT and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT); and the subjective Epworth Sleepiness S cale (ESS) compared to place bo (p < 0.001 for all endpoints in both studies). Overa ll clinical condition as rated by the Clinical Global Impr ession of Change (CGI-C) at the final visit was also significantly improved over baseline for p atients treated with modafinil compared to placebo in both studies (p < 0.005 and p < 0.03) ( US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Stud y Group 1998, US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group 2000). The efficacy of armodafinil for ED S associated with narcolepsy was established in a MC, DB, PC, RCT. Patients treated with armodafinil showed a statist ically significant enhanced ability to remain awake as mea sured by the MWT compared to placebo (p < 0.01), as well as improvement in overall clinic al condition as rated by the CGI-C compared to placebo (p < 0.0001). Armodafinil was also associated with statistically significant improvements in memory, attention, and fatigue (p < 0.05) ( Harsh et al 2006). The effectiveness of sodium o xybate in the treatment of EDS in patients with narcolepsy was established in 2 MC, DB, PC, RCTs. 181 Data as of April 30, 2019 JD/CME Page 3 of 9 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients.

T he Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. In the first study, patients treated with sodium oxybate 6 and 9 grams per night achieved statistically significant improvements on the ESS, MWT, and CGI-C compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001 for all) ( Xyrem International Study Group 2005a ). The second study required patient s to be taking a stable dose of modafinil before study randomization. Patients were randomized to placebo, sodium o xybate, modafinil, or sodium oxy bate plus modafinil. Patients who were switched from modafinil to sodium oxybate did not experience any decreas e in sleep latency, suggest ing that both medications are equally effective for EDS. P atients taking sodium oxybate a lone and sodium oxybate plus modafinil had statistically significant improve ments in sleep latency from ba seline as measured by MWT compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001). The sodium o xybate plus modafinil group showed a significantly greater increase in sleep latency from baseline compared to the sodium oxybate alone group (p < 0 .001), suggesting that the co mbination of drugs had an additive effect ( Black & Houghton 2006). The efficacy of sodium oxybate in the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy wa s established in 2 DB, PC, RCTs. In the first study, patients treated with 6 and 9 grams per nig ht saw a significant decrease in cataplexy attacks compared to placebo (p < 0.05 for both doses) ( U.S. Xyrem Multicenter Study Group 2002 ). The second study was a randomized withdrawal trial including na rcoleptic patients alread y established on sodium oxybate therapy prior to study entry. Patients were randomized to continue treatment with sodium oxybate or to placebo, which included discontin uation of sodium oxybate therapy. Patients who discontinued sodium oxybate experienced a significant increas e in cataplexy attacks compared to patients who remai ned on sodium oxybate (p < 0.001) ( U.S. Xyrem Multicenter Study Group 2004 ). The efficacy of solriamfetol fo r the treatment of narcolepsy or narcolepsy with cataplexy wa s evaluated in a DB, PC, MC, RCT (Thorpy et al 2019 ). Patients were stratified on t he basis of presence or absence of cataplexy. Cataplexy was present in 50.8% of patients over all, with similar percentages of patients with cataplexy in each of the treatment groups. At week 12, treatment with solria mfetol significantly improved mean sleep latency measured by the MWT vs placebo (p < 0.0001) and ESS scores (p 0.0 2). Significantly higher perce ntages of patients treated with solriamfetol also reported improvements in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) vs placebo (p < 0.0001). There was no clear effect of solriamfetol on the number of c ataplexy attacks per week among patients with cataplexy, although this study was not powered or designed to rigorousl y evaluate the effects of solriamfetol on cataplexy (data not shown). OSA The efficacy of modafinil for EDS associated with OSA was estab lished in 2 DB, PC, RCTs. In both studies, patients treated with modafinil saw a statis tically significant improvem ent in wakefulness compared to placebo (p < 0.001 for both) ( Black et al 2005, Pack et al 2001 ). The efficacy of armodafinil for ED S associated with OSA was est ablished in 2 PC, DB, RCTs. In both studies, patients treated with armodafinil showed a statistically significant imp rovement in the ability to rem ain awake as measured by the MWT (p < 0.001 and p = 0.0003) and overall clinical condition p er the CGI-C compared to placebo (p < 0.001 and p = 0.0069) ( Roth et al 2006, Hirshkowitz et al 2007 ). The efficacy of solriamfetol fo r the treatment of EDS in patien ts with OSA with current or prior sleep apnea treatment was demonstrated in a DB, PC, MC, RCT ( Schweitzer et al 2018 ). At week 12, solriamfe tol-treated patients had significantly greater improvements in mean sleep latency assess ed by the MWT (p < 0.001) and ESS score (p 0.02). At week 12, higher percentages o f patients on solriamfetol repo rted overall improvement on the PGI-C vs placebo (p < 0.0001). A randomized withdrawal study evaluated the maintenance of effi cacy and safety of solriamfetol vs placebo for the treatment of EDS in adults with OSA ( Strollo et al 2019 ). After 2 weeks of clinical titration and 2 weeks of stable do se administration, patients who repo rted \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" on the PGI-C and had numerical improvements on the MWT and ESS we re randomly assigned to place bo or solriamfetol for 2 additional weeks. From baseline to week 4, mean sleep latency on the MWT and ESS score s improved. From weeks 4 to 6 (randomized withdrawal phase), solriamfetol- treated patients maintained imp rovements in MWT and ESS. During the randomized withdrawal phase, more patients who were switched to placebo re ported worsening on the PGI-C and CGI-C vs those who continued solriamfetol. An OL extension study evaluated the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy of solriamfetol for up to 52 weeks in the treatment of patients with narcolepsy or OSA who completed previous trials of solriamfetol ( Sunosi dossier 2019 ).

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. a 2-week OL titration phase, patients received solriamfetol, ti trated to a maximum tolerated dose, followed by a maintenance phase. During a 2-week PC randomized withdrawal phase ~6 months later, pat ients were randomized either to placebo or to continue their maintenance solriamfetol dose for 2 weeks. From t he beginning to the end of the randomized withdrawal phase, the ESS score was significantly im proved with solriamfetol vs placebo (p < 0.0001). The percentage of patients who were reported as worse on the PGI-C at the end of the randomiz ed withdrawal phase was greater for patients randomized to placebo compared to patients on solriamfetol (p < 0.0001). Long-term maintenance of efficacy of solriamfetol was dem onstrated by sustained reductio ns in ESS scores. During t he randomized withdrawal period, patients did not demonstr ate rebound sleepiness or with drawal after abrupt discontinuation of solriamfetol. SWD The efficacy of modafinil in treating EDS associated with SWD w as evaluated in a DB, PC, RCT. Patients treated with modafinil showed a statistically s ignificant improvement in nighttime sleep latency as meas ured by the MSLT (p = 0.002) (Czeisler et al 2005 ). The efficacy of armodafinil in tr eating EDS associated with SWD was evaluated in a DB, PC, RCT. Patients treated with armodafinil showed a statistically significant improvement in s leep latency as measured by nighttime MSLT compared to placebo (p < 0.001) ( Czeisler et al 2009 ). A head-to-head study conducted by Tembe et al compared armodafi nil to modafinil in patients with SWD. The study compared the response rate, def ined as the proportion of patien ts showing 2 grades o f improvement based on the Stanford Sleepiness Score (SSS). After 12 weeks of therapy, there was no statistically signifi cant different in response rates between patients treated with armodafinil vs modafinil (p = 0.76). Compliance to ther apy and adverse events (AEs) were also similar between groups (p = 0.63 and p = 0.78, respec tively) ( oxy bate, and solriamfetol have all been shown to be more effective compared to placebo for their respective FDA-approved indications, as demonstrated by significant improvements in objective and subjective measures of EDS. In addition, s odium oxybate has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of cataplexy attacks in narcolepsy patients compared to p lacebo. While there is insuffi cient evidence to suggest that one agent is more efficacious than another, some st udies have demonstrated that c oncurrent therapy with so dium oxybate and modafinil had a greater effect on EDS and wakefulness than either agent o n its own, suggesting an additive effect (Alshaikh et al 2012, Billiard et al 1994, Black & H oughton 2006, Black et al 2010a, Black et al 2010b, Bl ack et al 2016, Broughton et al 1997, Kuan et al 2016, Xyrem International Study Group 2005b, Schwartz et al 2010, Weaver et al 2006). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Narcolepsy: The 2007 AASM practice parameters for the treatment of narcolep sy and other hypersomnias of central origin (Morgenthaler et al 2007a) recommend pharmacologic therapy based on the diagnosis and ta rgeted symptoms. Most of the agents used to treat EDS have little effect on cataplexy or other REM sleep associated symptoms, while most antidepressants and anticataplec tics have little effect on aler tness; however, some medica tions act on both symptoms. Co-administration of 2 or more d rug classes may be required in some patients to adequatel y address their symptoms. Scheduled naps may be beneficial, but seldom suffice as primary therapy for narcolepsy. The guidelines state that modafinil is effective for treatment of EDS due to narcolepsy and sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy, EDS, and disrupted sleep due to narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate may be effective for treatment of hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Amphetamine, methamphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methylphen idate are effective for treatment of to ts (tricyclics, Tricyclics, SSRIs, and v enlafaxine may be effective treatment for sleep paralysis and hypnagogic ha llucinations. The European Academy of Neurology (EAN) 2011 guidelines on mana gement of narcolepsy in adults ( Billiard tment for EDS assoc iated with narcolepsy when EDS is the most disturbing symptom. Sodium oxybat e is recommended when EDS, cat aplexy, and poor sleep coexist. The guideline notes that the combination of modafinil and sodium oxybate may be more effective than sodium oxybate alone. Methylphenidate may be an option if the response to modafinil i s inadequate; sodium oxybate is not recommended. Naps are best scheduled on a patient-by-patient basis. While armodafinil has been shown in clinical studies to be effe ctive for EDS in narcolepsy, i ts specific place in therapy is not discussed in the current guidelines. 183 Data as of April 30, 2019 JD/CME Page 5 of 9 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. OSA: The 2006 AASM practice parameters for the medical therapy of OSA ( Morgenthaler et al 2006 ) provide recommendations for patients with OSA who do not adapt well to or respond to initial therapy with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, or surgical modification. Dietary weight loss in obese individuals may be beneficial and should be combined with a primary treatment for OSA. Modafinil is recommen ded for the treatment of residual EDS in OSA patients wh o have sleepiness despite effect ive PAP treatment and who are lacking any other identifiable cause for their sleepiness. SWD: The AASM practice parameters for the clinical evaluation and tr eatment of circadian rh ythm sleep disorders (Morgenthaler et al 2007b) recommend planned napping before or during the night shift to i mprove alertness and performance in patients with SWD . Timed light exposure in the work environment and light res triction in the morning, when feasible, is indicated to decrease sleepiness and improve alertness during night shift work. Administration of melatonin prior to daytime sleep is indicated to promote daytim e sleep among night shift wor kers. Hypnotic medications may be used to promote daytime sleep among night shift workers. Carryover of sedation to the nighttime shift with potential adverse consequences fo r nighttime performance and safety must be considered. Modafinil is indicated to enhance alertnes s during the night shift for SWD. Caffeine is indicated to enhance alertness during the night shift for SWD. SAFETY SUMMARY Sodium oxybate is contraindicated in patients with succinic sem ialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency and when used in combination with sedativ e hypnotics or alcohol. Sodium oxybate carries a boxed wa rning regarding CNS depression and misuse and abuse. Respiratory depression may occu r; the concurrent use of sodium oxybate with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of respiratory depres sion, hypotension, profound sedat ion, syncope, and death. As a sodium salt of the Schedule I controlled subs tance GHB, so dium oxybate abuse or mis use may be associated with CNS AEs including seizure , respiratory depression, decreas ed levels of conscious ness, coma, and death. Because of these risks, sodium oxybate is only available throug h a restricted distribution program called the Xyrem REMS program using a central pha rmacy that is specially certifi ed. Prescribers and patient s must also enroll in the program ( Xyrem REMS Web site ). Additional warnings and precautions for sodium oxybate include: Patients should avoid participat ion in hazardous activities req uiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination within the first 6 hours of dosi ng or after first initiating tr eatment until certain that sodium oxybate does not adversely affect them. Monitor patients for signs of new or increased depression and s uicidality, impaired motor and cognitive function, and episodes of sleepwalking. Due to its high sodium content, patients with heart failure, hy pertension, or impaired renal fu nction should be routinely monitored while taking sodium oxybate. Common AEs with sodium oxybate we re nausea, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, enuresis, and tremor. Warnings and Precautions for modafinil and armodafinil include: Cases of serious rash, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, have been reported. Discontinue therapy at the first sign of rash unless certain r ash is not drug-related. Angioedema and anaphylaxis reaction s may occur. Discontinue the rapy and immediately seek medical attention at the first signs of angioedema or anaphylaxis. Multi-organ hypersensitivity reac tions may occur. There are no known factors to predict t he risk of occurrence or the severity of the reaction, and t herapy should be discontinued in these patients. Persistent sleepiness: patients should be regularly assessed fo r degree of sleepiness and advised against driving or other potentially dangerous activities if necessary. The emergence or exacerbation o f psychiatric symptoms have been reported; use particular c aution in patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania. Consider increased monitoring in patients with known cardiovascular disease. 184 Data as of April 30, 2019 JD/CME Page 6 of 9 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The most common AEs with modafin il were headache, nausea, nervo usness, rhinitis, diarrh ea, back pain, anxiety, insomnia, dizziness, and dyspepsi a; the most common AEs with ar modafinil were headache, nausea, dizziness, and insomnia. Drug interactions for m odafinil and armodafinil: Exposure to CYP 3A4/5 substrates may Effectiveness steroidal contra ceptives may be reduced; use a lternative or concomitant contraceptive methods while taking and for 1 month a fter discontinuation of modafinil or armodafinil. Blood concentrations of cyclospo rine may be reduced requiring monitoring and possible dose adjustment. Exposure to CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam, may be increased. More frequent monitoring of prothrombin times/international normalized ratio (INR) should be considered when administered with warfarin. Use caution when concomitantly used with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Solriamfetol is contraindicated with concomitant use of MAOIs, or within 14 days following di scontinuation of an MAOI because of the risk of hypertensive reaction. Warnings and precautions of solri amfetol include blood pressure and heart rate increases and psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, insomni a, and irritability. The most common AEs in either the narcolepsy or OSA populations were headache, nausea , decreased appetite, insomnia, and anxiety. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Table 3.

See the current prescribing in formation for full details CONCLUSION Narcolepsy is a chronic neurolo gical condition that causes exce ssive sleepiness th roughout the day. E DS can vary in severity and in the most severe cases patients suddenly fall asleep during normal activities. Patients with narcolepsy present with or without clear e vidence of cataplexy (type 1 vs type 2, respectively). There is no cure for narcolepsy and current treatments focus on alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life. Current clinical evidence support s the use of modafinil as a fi rst-line agent in treating EDS associated with narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate can be used as a second-line agent for EDS in na rcolepsy, but is considered first-line therapy for patients diagnosed with cataplexy. While armodafinil has been s hown in clinical studies to be effective in treating narcolepsy-associated EDS, the current clinical guidelines do not discuss a specific plac e in therapy. Amphetamine, methamphetamine, dextroamphetam ine, and methylphenidate are add itional treatment alterna tives for EDS due to narcolepsy, while TCAs, SSRIs, and venlafaxine are second-line alternatives for patients wi th cataplexy. Solriamfetol has not yet been incorporated into the guidelines. Patients with OSA should be treat ed with primary CPAP therapy, and then may use modafinil a s an adjunctive treatment for residual sleepiness. SWD sho uld be treated by utilizing a p lanned sleep schedule, including regular naps before and during the work shift; modafinil may be used to enhance wakeful ness in these patients. While current clinical data i ndicate that modafinil, armodafini l, sodium oxybate, and solriamfet ol are all effective for their respective FDA-approved indications, there is a lack of head-to -head data among these agents . A treatment plan should be individualized for all patients and the risks and benefits should be evaluated before b eginning any pharmacological therapy. Modafinil, armodafinil, and solriamfetol are oral tablets that are dosed once daily. Sodium oxybate is an oral solution that must be taken at bedtime and re peated 2.5 to 4 hours later. Cur rently, modafinil and arm odafinil are available generically. Sodium oxybate carries a boxed wa rning for the risk of CNS depr ession, misuse, and abuse. Sodium oxybate is only available through the Xyrem REMS program; patients and prescrib ers must enroll in the prog ram and sodium oxybate is only dispensed through a s pecially certified pharmacy.
