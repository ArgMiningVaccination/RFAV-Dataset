I don't think they're a monster, just a clueless dorkIt's not a question of sense but rather of sensibility. I think that people can joke about anything, but I wouldn't joke on this article because it's too horrible to me. Others may feel different, but that doesn't automatically make them monsters... I think. Research into phages was huge ~100 years ago (used in lots of major discoveries, e.g. of DNA), but after the discovery of penicillin and a bunch of other broad-spectrum antibiotics after WWII, it became less popular.Why has phage research lagged? I remember first reading about bacteriophages 60 years ago. Early phage research suffered from a number of problems that were related to the state of medical science and equipment available at that time. This resulted in a souring of medical opinion about the usefulness of phages in disease treatment. Once big pharma solved the problems with producing large quantities of antibiotics that were good enough to widely distribute while phages required very specific cultivation on a patient and bacteria combination. This put a lid on further phage research until the recent rise of superbugs. To get a better idea of what's involved in using phages as a treatment in the modern age, I recommend reading \"The Perfect Predator\"Why has phage research lagged? I remember first reading about bacteriophages 60 years ago. Bacteria's ability to turn things that are supposed to be nasty for them into an energy source is pretty amazing, though very tragic in this situation.This particular one? Several enzymes that quickly destroy beta-lactam antibiotics when they enter the bacterial cell. This is a very efficient way to defend against antibiotics, as one molecule of enzyme can \"disarm\" huge amounts of antibiotic molecules. Heck, bacteria can actually use the products of beta-lactam hydrolysis as an energy source. This bacteria also has natural efflux pumps that can pump out several other antibiotics, but efflux pumps are less efficient, because they require energy to function. With all the incidents of bad practice in health product manufacturing coming out of India, why are we still sourcing product from that country? It's clear that their version of the FDA is not up to the task. I don't believe these drops were preservative free, though. Those typically have to be packaged in individual-use (or at least daily-use) containers.Replying to Chuckstar, or would if the app was working properly. The irony is that \"Preservative Free\" sells, largely because of chemophobia. However, \"preservative free\" and \"incapable of preventing remaining infectious\" are synonyms, so \"preservative free\" needs to be also synonymous with\"have highest faith in technical excellence of manufacturer\". I don't actually see the problem. All the bacteria (many bacterium, plural) causing the outbreak comes from one strain only. The singular therefore refers to the strain and not the bacteria. The original poster complaining about grammar use seems to be the one with comphrehension errors, not the author.I think they're mad at this sentence: The bacteria behind the outbreak is a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa dubbed VIM-GES-CRPA. (Bolding mine.) Grammatical errors happen, especially when you're going from plural to singular. I do it all the time (probably much to the chagrin of my English professor father!) - even in my posts here. I don't think anyone's trying to con anyone, or feed misinformation. It's just an easy error to make and skip over. Has Albicidin even been through Phase I? Last I read they haven't even picked a candidate variation.Has anyone in the critical path tried albicidin yet? If ever there was a time to just go with it, it's now. As someone suffering from a dry eye disease: BULLSHIT!The irony is that \"Preservative Free\" sells, largely because of chemophobia. Because markets! And free trade! And profits! You're doing it wrong! Try these ones:The difference is the applicator. It's designed to make use a one way solution direction. The bottle will smush as the product is used rather than suck back in air and unused drops. Kinda a PITA to apply with specific instructions. The shape of the cap is actually also the shape of the applicator. Maybe a one way valve kind of thing. USA origin. Somebody wrote here about the high specificity of phages, and the constant arms race between bacteria and phages, so that phage libraries would have to be constantly updated.Why has phage research lagged? I remember first reading about bacteriophages 60 years ago. When people are going to die horribly right now, no hope, it's not time to run the full process.Has Albicidin even been through Phase I? Last I read they haven't even picked a candidate variation. IANAL, but perhaps the theory is simply negligence? That when you're selling something the presumption is you're selling something vaguely safe and fit for purpose, which this product clearly wasn't.I'm all for the victims getting compensation, but why would the retailers be liable? Did they continue to sell the product after the recall? In what way were they negligent? Or applied directly to eyeballs where bacteria is reproducing?That's why phages have mostly been used either in the GI tract, or to treat open wounds where you can just spray the phage solution onto the infected tissues. Nice try, sentient bacterium!What makes this bacteria resistant? I understand chemical compositions of their cell walls can make antibiotics difficult to penetrate, or they may be able to produce proteins to pump out antibiotics, but the article doesn't make the reason clear, just that it can share the resistant, which I assume is by ejecting their plasmid containing the genes allowing for their resistance. as soon as the 'inspector' has gone out the door, its back to the same old ways.Pharmaceutical manufacturers in India that produce for the US market are subject to inspection by the US FDA. Unfortunately many of those inspections were suspended or reduced due to COVID, and the FDA capacity to perform these has not increased with the rise in overseas drug manufacturing. Perhaps the FDA needs to have people on-site at all times, and their bosses come to check on things periodically?as soon as the 'inspector' has gone out the door, its back to the same old ways. sifting though reams of reports, test results and procedural manuals is unlike being on site, watching every move within these manufacturing facilities. at least if these sensitive products were made within US borders, there would be a higher incentive (no gurantee!) to be held accountable. One of the last times I heard something like this I was thinking that the workers must be either severely ignorant of best practices, or paid enough to not care (better than market rates for their labor), or both. And ironically I want more labor unions, not less.The last line of the story really struck me: \"The FDA posted an inspection report of Global Parma's facility, finding a slew of manufacturing violations, slime on equipment, and a lack of measures to ensure sterility.\" What. The. Fuck. How the HELL are we not hearing about a forced shutdown of this facility, either permanently or until they can demonstrate they have their act together This is horrifying. Phase I is hardly the \"full process\". When people are going to die horribly, what you don't do is risk making it more horrible.When people are going to die horribly right now, no hope, it's not time to run the full process. A lot of what the FDA looks at can't be just fixed up the day they arrive. Failure to maintain documentation of regular testing and calibration can't be just cleaned up on the spot, for instance.as soon as the 'inspector' has gone out the door, its back to the same old ways. sifting though reams of reports, test results and procedural manuals is unlike being on site, watching every move within these manufacturing facilities. at least if these sensitive products were made within US borders, there would be a higher incentive (no gurantee!) to be held accountable. The retailer has to actually be negligent, though, and not just themselves the victim of someone else's negligence.IANAL, but perhaps the theory is simply negligence? That when you're selling something the presumption is you're selling something vaguely safe and fit for purpose, which this product clearly wasn't. I doubt that introducing difficult-to-assess liability along a huge supply chain is an efficient way to avoid these risks, being that (1) courts and lawyers are notoriously expensive, (2) LLCs are commonly used for those profiting by taking the risk to nevertheless avoid liability, (3) it shifts the burden of proof to the victims, which really already have enough troubles in cases like this, when they even survive. But regardless, perhaps it's the tool the victims currently have. I'd have buzzed FuzzyFuzzyFungus, but then I realised they might be commenting on a different Dr.Mole article, nomen est omen and so...Nice try, doing it wrong! Try these ones: [https://www.target.com/p/systane-ultra-lubricant-eye-drops-vials-60ct/-/A-49133381#lnk=sametab] You take a vial, uncork it, and then use it once (realistically, you can keep it for a couple of hours and use it a couple of times). Also try different brands: Systane, Retaine, Refresh. Also, try cooling the vials in a fridge, it helps. One word, cost. Here in the UK, where the largest single purchaser of drugs by a country mile is the NHS; the government are screwing down the prices so much it can be difficult to even cover the cost to make the stuff in the first place. You can't (directly) cut corners on quality, but if your supply chain has been mostly sourcing your raw materials and packaging components from traditional western economies, the likes of India and China can start to look very attractive.With all the incidents of bad practice in health product manufacturing coming out of India, why are we still sourcing product from that country? It's clear that their version of the FDA is not up to the task. I don't buy dog food anymore that has ingredients sourced from China for good reason. Why are we still assuming that Indian pharmaceutical and other health products are okay? There are several instances of cough syrups and other products coming from Indian companies killing people. It's time to start boycotting at a national level. Partly it's also because it was developed in the Soviet Union; Georgia in particular, but its also used in Russia and Poland. It's less profitable. Less needed? IDK we've had antibacterial resistance for a long time now, overuse of antibiotics even longer. Big pharmaceutical companies have mostly abandoned antibiotic research since the mid-80s. It's methodology is not that difficult to patent, and I'd say it reveals serious deficiencies in global medical research, and Big Pharma (which is overdependent on the US market). Phage therapy could have been extremely useful and saved many lives for many decades now. It can basically be used in every single case of bacterial infection, even for acne! \"Following the money\" may be a case of metaphorically spelunking in the sewers; When medicine isn't profitable.Follow the money? Presumably hard to patent and unneeded until relatively recently Sorry, I didn't see you're post when I posted, you have a lot better history. But, I personally don't think \"non-socialized medical systems\" should even exist. Right now the US system combines the worst of both capitalistic and socialized medicine. To function right medical care needs to be nationalized. Just like firefighting is basically \"socialized\". Although, admittedly, the industrialized countries' pharmaceutical research are basically being subsidized by the US, because Big Pharma can make big profits in the American market, before negotiating with all the others. Of course, this means only potentially very profitable medicine gets researched.whether the economics will ever make sense in non-socialized medical systems isn't clear. "}
