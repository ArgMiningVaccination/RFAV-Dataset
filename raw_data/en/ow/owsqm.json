Additional Information How much will the vaccine cost? There will be no charge to the person receiving the vaccine. However, insurance information will be collected. Federal guidelines ensure that no one is charged out-of-pocket for the administration of the vaccine. There will be no co-pay and no charge to those who do not have insurance. The vaccine is free, but insurance may be charged for the administration fee by the Department of Health in the state where the vaccine was administered. [Day of Vaccine](#accordionMenu1) What can I expect on the day of my vaccination? How long will it take? You will be required to wear a mask. You will be screened, registered, immunized and observed. The process takes roughly 30 minutes from start to finish. Participants will be given a vaccine information sheet with drug facts and instructions if adverse reactions are encountered after the observation period. A second dose is required 21 days after the initial immunization for the Pfizer vaccine and 28 days for the Moderna vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine is a single-dose vaccine. Although use of this vaccine was paused on April 12 pending review by the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), the pause was lifted April 23. The pause was recommended after reports of a small number of cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot associated with a low platelet count in individuals following administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Most cases of this condition occurred in females between ages 18 and 49 years. The risk of this blood clot condition is extremely low, about 1.9 cases per million persons vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. After assessing the risk, the FDA has determined that the available data show the vaccine's known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in adults. The FDA and CDC have confidence this [vaccine is safe and effective](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/fda-cdc-lift-vaccine-use.html) in preventing COVID-19. Please note, the Parkview Mirro Center Vaccine Clinic administers only the Pfizer vaccine. When I come in to get the vaccine, what do I need to bring? Please bring a work identification badge, driver's license or photo ID, and your insurance card. If you will be receiving your second or booster dose, please bring your vaccination card. If you no longer have, or can't find your card, a new card will be provided at the clinic. My child has a vaccination appointment. Am I able to attend? For safety and efficacy, the Parkview COVID-19 Vaccine Clinic requires that a parent or guardian must accompany the minor who is receiving the vaccine. We will not allow a minor to receive the vaccine without their parent or guardian present. [About the Vaccine](#accordionMenu2) Which manufacturers will supply the vaccine? Initial allocations consisted of the first two COVID-19 vaccines available, which are being manufactured by [Pfizer ](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine)and [Moderna](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-primary-efficacy-analysis-phase-3-cove-study). Only the Pfizer vaccine is approved for use with those ages 5-17 and as a booster for those ages 16-17. The Parkview Mirro Center Vaccine Clinic administers only the Pfizer vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine is the first single-dose vaccine available in the U.S. Additional information about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, including the recent temporary pause in use that was lifted April 23, can be found on the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/index.html) website. Are there harmful ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccines? The approved COVID-19 vaccines do not contain toxic or harmful ingredients. They are not made using egg proteins, unlike some flu vaccines, which allows people who have an egg allergy to safely receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Can I get COVID-19 from the vaccine? You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are both messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a \"viral vector\" technology. These vaccines do not contain live virus. The vaccine is designed to trigger a protective immune response in your body, so that your immune system can protect you from infection by the COVID-19 virus. Sometimes this immune response process can cause temporary side effects, such as soreness and redness at the injection site, fatigue, headache, and muscle or joint pain. These symptoms are normal and a sign of your body building immunity. It requires two doses of the mRNA vaccine to build immunity, and immunity is established 14 days after the second dose. That means it is possible a person could become infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 either just before or just after getting the first dose of vaccine and could become sick, since it takes time for the vaccine to provide protection. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only one dose, and immunity is established 14 days after vaccination. How do mRNA vaccines work? Will mRNA vaccines alter my DNA or genetic makeup? mRNA is used by cells as a template to produce proteins. mRNA from the COVID-19 vaccine never enters the cell nucleus, where your DNA resides, and, therefore, it never affects or interacts with your DNA in any way. The mRNA in the vaccine simply provides a template to allow your body's cells near the injection site to produce a harmless piece of \"spike protein\" to allow your body's immune system to build a response and make antibodies to the virus. Your cells then rapidly break down the vaccine mRNA within 48 hours once the protein is produced. In sum, the vaccines use mRNA to allow your body's own natural protein production and immune response build antibodies to protect you from the virus. How do viral vector vaccines work? Will viral vector vaccines alter my DNA or genetic makeup? The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a genetically engineered common cold virus called adenovirus to deliver instructions for your body's cells to produce a harmless pieces of \"spike protein\" that prompt your immune system to build a response and make antibodies to the virus. It can enter cells, but it doesn't replicate or spread in the body. It won't give you a cold or affect your DNA or genetic makeup in any way. Do COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility or other serious medical problems? In the Pfizer phase 3 clinical trial of more than 43,000 individuals; the Moderna phase 3 clinical trial with over 30,000 individuals and the Johnson & Johnson trial with 44,000 people, no serious safety concerns were observed. There is absolutely no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines affect the fertility of women or men. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine COVID-19 Task Force clinical recommendations issued Dec. 16, 2020, state: \"The Task Force does not recommend withholding the vaccine from patients who are planning to conceive, who are currently pregnant, or who are lactating. These recommendations are in line with those of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM). Patients undergoing fertility treatment and pregnant patients should be encouraged to receive the vaccination based on eligibility criteria.\" Is the vaccine safe? Yes. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. The vaccines met the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality needed to support [emergency use authorization](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download) (EUA). The original clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines were conducted in 2020, and since then more than 536 million doses have been given in the U.S. to date. These vaccines have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. This monitoring includes using both [established and new safety monitoring systems ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/pdfs/vaccine-safety-monitoring.pdf)to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. EUA is issued by the FDA based on careful review of all the clinical trial safety and efficacy data by an appointed panel of clinical experts. From there, the vaccine is reviewed by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which issues guidance on the appropriate use of each vaccine. The IDOH and its COVID-19 Vaccine Review Advisory Group also review and issue guidance for any new vaccine before it's administered in Indiana. On Aug. 23, the Pfizer vaccine received FDA approval. It also continues to be available under EUA, including for individuals five through 15 years of age and for the administration of a third dose for people aged 12 and older. How effective is the vaccine? Early data showed both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are approximately 95% effective at preventing COVID-19. In addition, a Pfizer clinical trial of approximately 2,000 children (12 and older) showed the vaccine was 100% effective. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has a 66% global efficacy against preventing moderate to severe illness, but, more importantly, it is 85% effective against severe illness and 100% effective in preventing death. ACIP states no preference among current vaccines and encourages people to receive the earliest vaccine available to them. It's important to know that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are two doses. If you receive a Pfizer vaccine, you'll need to receive a second dose of Pfizer vaccine 21 days following the first dose. If you receive a Moderna vaccine, you'll need to receive a second dose of Moderna vaccine 28 days after the first dose. Protection occurs seven days after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and two weeks after the second Moderna dose. You must receive the same vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) for both doses. Protection from the single dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine begins in 14 days. Will I need a booster shot? There are now booster recommendations for all three COVID-19 vaccines available in the US. People aged 18 and older may choose which of the three vaccines they receive as a booster dose; however, in most situations, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for primary and booster vaccination, individuals who are 12-17 can get a Pfizer vaccine booster. Moderately or severely immunocompromised people ages five years and older should receive a vaccine booster. Individuals aged 12 or older who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine are eligible for a booster shot at five months or more after their initial series. People aged 18 and older who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are eligible for a booster shot at two months or more after their primary vaccination. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the preferred booster in most situations. When should I get the bivalent COVID-19 booster? The booster should be received at least two months after the completion of the primary series or last (original) monovalent booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Novavax vaccine. Patients 12-17 years of age may only receive the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent booster. Patients 18 years of age and older may receive either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Moderna bivalent booster. Individuals who received an initial dose of the Janssen vaccine are recommended to receive a monovalent booster at least two months after the vaccine and a bivalent booster at least two months after the monovalent booster. What happens if I can't get my second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine in a timely manner? The CDC continues to recommend that people get their second dose of COVID-19 vaccine as close to the recommended interval as possible (21 days for Pfizer and 28 days for Moderna). According to new guidance from the CDC, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. [Side Effects and Contraindications](#accordionMenu3) What are the vaccine side effects? Mild side effects are fairly common and usually transient symptoms related to your body's normal immune response to the vaccine. The vaccines' reported side effects were injection site pain or swelling, injection site redness, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever (up to and greater than 100.4 F), nausea, feeling unwell and swollen lymph nodes. These are temporary and indicate that your body's immune system is reacting properly. Data from the [Pfizer](https://www.fda.gov/media/144246/download), [Moderna](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download) and [Janssen](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download) (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine trials indicate that most systemic post-vaccination signs and symptoms are mild to moderate in severity and occur within the first three days of vaccination (the day of vaccination and following two days, with most occurring the day after vaccination). They usually resolve within one to two days of onset and are more frequent and severe following the second dose and among younger persons compared to those who are older (>55 years). For the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, local reactions within seven days were similar from dose 1 and dose 2 for patients of all age groups. For both vaccines, systemic reactions within seven days after dose 2 were higher than after dose 1 for patients aged 18-64 years of age, and they were generally lower for patients aged 65 years and older. Headache was similar from dose 1 and dose 2. Vomiting and diarrhea where similar for both dose 1 and dose 2 for the Pfizer vaccine. Nausea and vomiting were higher after dose 2 for the Moderna vaccine. Medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be taken to treat post-vaccination symptoms. With the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, women younger than age 50 should be aware of a slightly increased risk for a rare but serious blood clotting disorder. You should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms within 14 days after receiving Johnson & Johnson vaccine: - Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision - Shortness of breath - Chest pain - Leg swelling - Persistent abdominal pain - Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of the injection Cough, shortness of breath, rhinorrhea, sore throat or loss of taste or smell are not consistent with post-vaccination symptoms, and instead may be symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 or another infection. Should I take a medication before my vaccination to pre-treat for side effects? Routine pre-treatment for the purposes of preventing symptoms is not recommended at this time, due to the lack of information on impact of use on vaccine-induced antibody responses. Medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be taken to treat post-vaccination symptoms. What do I need to know about a severe allergic reaction? There is a very remote chance that the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. Severe allergic reactions are quite rare, occurring about 1 in every 100,000 doses of vaccine given. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. Signs of a severe reaction can include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over the body, or dizziness and weakness. EMS and nurses will be onsite at the Mirro Center should a participant experience a reaction. The information on allergic reactions is based on the best knowledge to date and could change at any time, pending new information and further guidance from the FDA or CDC. Polyethylene glycol is a component of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and is known to cause anaphylaxis rarely. You should not receive the vaccine if you have a known history of severe allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine contains polysorbate 80, and a known polysorbate allergy is a contraindication to vaccination. Individuals with common allergies to medications, foods, inhalants, insects and latex are not expected to have an allergic reaction to the vaccine more than the general public. However, if you have had an anaphylactic reaction to any medication or food, you should be monitored for 30 minutes after vaccination. Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any vaccine or injectable therapy (intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous) are asked to not receive the vaccine at the Mirro Center and should discuss the benefits and risks with your provider. What are the contraindications to receiving the vaccine? You should not receive the vaccine if you have had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components; an immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components (including polyethylene glycol); or an immediate allergic reaction of any severity to polysorbate. Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any vaccine or injectable therapy (intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous) are asked to not receive the vaccine at the Mirro Center and should discuss their situation with their healthcare provider. In some cases, referral to an allergist may be helpful. What if I have contraindications? You should speak to your primary care provider to discuss the potential of you receiving the vaccine elsewhere, or if a referral to an allergist would be appropriate. What if I have an adverse reaction after leaving the clinic? Dial 911 if you have a life-threatening emergency. Contact your primary care provider if you encounter mild reactions that bother you or do not go away. If you sign up, you can also report any reaction through the free v-safe after-vaccination health checker smartphone app. Sign up at [vsafe.cdc.gov](https://vsafe.cdc.gov/). Side effects may also be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System by calling the toll-free number at [1-800-822-7967](tel:1-800-822-7967) or by visiting [https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html).

For the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you may contact Janssen Biotech, Inc. at [1-800-565-4008](tel:1-800-565-4008). [Vaccination for those with specific health concerns or conditions](#accordionMenu4) What if I am sick? You should not be vaccinated if you currently have a fever or are not feeling well. Should those who are planning to conceive, pregnant or recently pregnant receive the COVID-19 vaccine? The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG) recommends that all pregnant women be vaccinated against COVID-19. Getting a vaccine will help protect you and your fetus and is the best way to reduce the risk of maternal or fetal complications. None of the currently available vaccines reach or cross the placenta, and vaccination does not induce antibodies against the placenta. However, protective antibodies have been shown to cross the placenta and confer protection to the baby after delivery. ACOG also recommends that breastfeeding women get the COVID-19 vaccine. There is no need to stop breastfeeding if you wish to get the vaccine. When you are vaccinated, antibodies made by your body may be passed through breastmilk to help protect your child from the COVID-19 virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recently recommended urgent action to increase COVID-19 vaccination among women who are pregnant, lactating or trying to become pregnant. Multiple studies have shown that vaccination among pregnant women is safe and does not increase the risk of maternal or fetal complications. In contrast, pregnant women infected with COVID-19 have higher odds of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, small size for gestational age, low birth weight and stillbirth. Compared with non-pregnant symptomatic pregnant women with COVID-19 infection have more than a two-fold increased risk of requiring ICU admission and a 70% increased risk of death. COVID-19 infection also increases risk of stillbirth, preterm birth and neonatal ICU admission. Do COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility? There is absolutely no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, affect the fertility of women or men. Multiple studies - including large-scale clinical trials, studies among couples trying to conceive and among individuals undergoing fertility treatment - have shown now effect of vaccines on fertility. The vaccines do not affect your DNA and do not interact with anything else in your body that could cause fertility issues. ACOG recommends vaccination for individuals who are planning or trying to become pregnant. What if I am undergoing fertility treatments? According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, since the vaccine is not a live virus, there is no reason to delay pregnancy attempts or defer fertility treatment because of vaccination. How will the vaccine affect me or my baby if I am breastfeeding? COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people 12 years and older for Pfizer and 18 and older for Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, including those who are breastfeeding. ACOG and SMFM recommend that those who have recently delivered and were not vaccinated during pregnancy are also strongly encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as possible. SMFM and other pregnancy experts recommend that lactating people be vaccinated against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines cannot cause infection in anyone and are effective at preventing COVID-19 in people who are breastfeeding. Recent reports have shown that breastfeeding people who have received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have antibodies in their breastmilk, which could help protect their babies. More data are needed to determine what protection these antibodies may provide to the baby. May I receive another vaccine before or after I receive the COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. Previously, COVID-19 vaccines were recommended to be administered alone with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration with any other vaccines, out of an abundance of caution. Although data are not available for COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines, extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. Should I get the vaccine if I am immunocompromised? How many doses do I need? Yes, people with moderately to severely compromised immune systems are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 because they are more at risk for serious, prolonged illness. The vaccines are not live vaccines and can be safely administered to immunocompromised patients. In fact, a third dose is now recommended for these patients. People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems may not build the same level of immunity from the two-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series compared to people who are not immunocompromised, and they may benefit from an additional dose to ensure adequate protection. The CDC recommends that moderately to severely immunocompromised people who are at least 12 years of age (Pfizer) or 18 years of age (Moderna) receive an additional dose of vaccine to improve their immune system's response to their initial vaccine series. The third dose of vaccine should be administered five months after the first two doses of the vaccine. People ages 12-17 should only get a Pfizer vaccine booster shot. Individuals ages 18 or older should get a booster shot of either Pfizer or Moderna in most situations. People aged 18 and older who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are eligible for a booster shot at two months after their primary vaccination. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the preferred booster in most situations. Factors to consider in assessing the general level of immune competence in a patient include disease severity, duration, clinical stability, complications, comorbidities and any potentially immune-suppressing treatment. These conditions and treatments include but are not limited to: - Active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies - Receipt of solid-organ transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy - Receipt of CAR-T-cell or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within two years of transplantation or taking immunosuppression therapy) - Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) - Advanced or untreated HIV infection - Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (i.e., 20mg prednisone or equivalent antimetabolites, transplant-related (TNF) blockers, and other biologic agents that are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory If you are immunocompromised, talk to your healthcare provider about your medical condition and whether getting an additional dose is appropriate for you. Should I take the COVID-19 vaccine if I have a chronic health condition? Adults of any age with [certain underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html), such as diabetes, obesity, heart conditions, COPD, chronic kidney disease and cancer, are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, making vaccination especially important. If a person with a chronic health condition is part of a group (e.g. healthcare personnel) who is recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, they are eligible to be vaccinated. Should I get the vaccine if I have already had a COVID-19 infection? Current evidence shows that most individuals who have had prior COVID-19 infection and develop antibodies have a very low risk of reinfection in the first three to six months after recovery. However, it is still unclear to what degree those with detectable antibodies protect against reinfection or what concentration of antibodies are needed to provide such protection. Evidence also shows that post-infection immunity diminishes over time. Unfortunately, we do not currently have enough scientific evidence to know what level of antibodies from post-infection immunity measured on a blood test reliably predict protection from reinfection. It is also unknown how the emergence of new virus variants will impact post-infection immunity. Research shows that the degree of post-infection immunity gained after COVID-19 infection is highly variable across individuals; antibody levels can vary by as much as 1,000-fold among those with post-infection immunity. Additionally, some individuals are unable to develop a significant level of neutralizing antibodies after an infection. Vaccination offers several important advantages over post-infection immunity alone. First, vaccination is tremendously safer than becoming infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Although many will have mild or asymptomatic infections, others will develop severe disease leading to hospitalization and possibly death. Additionally, 10-20% of individuals who have COVID-19 develop persistent symptoms (commonly referred to as \"long COVID\") that can last for months after initial recovery. Vaccination provides a much more predictable and specific immune response and thus provides more reliable protection over time from infection, serious illness and death. Receiving a booster dose after vaccination further enhances protection from disease, serious illness and dealth. The CDC currently recommends that all adults who have received a COVID-19 vaccine receive a booster. A growing body of research suggests that post-infection immunity, plus vaccination, provides the strongest protection against a range of COVID-19 virus variants. Researchers have found that individuals with pre-existing immunity from prior infection mount a superior antibody response to vaccination compared to those without pre-existing immunity. Should I get the vaccine if I know I have been exposed to COVID-19? Vaccination should be deferred until the quarantine period has ended to avoid exposing healthcare personnel or other persons during a vaccination visit. Should I get the vaccine if I have received passive antibody therapy (bamlanivimab, casirivimab+imdevimab, or convalescent plasma) for COVID-19? Vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days to avoid interferences of the treatment with vaccine-induced immune responses. [Post Vaccine Q & A](#accordionMenu5) Can the vaccine cause a positive COVID-19 test? COVID-19 vaccination does not influence the results of nucleic acid (PCR) or antigen tests for COVID-19. Once I receive the vaccine, am I no longer at risk for being a carrier? Can I stop wearing a mask? COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting people from getting seriously ill, getting hospitalized and even dying. Infections happen in only a small proportion of people who are fully vaccinated, even with the Delta and Omicron variants; however, fully vaccinated people with breakthrough infections can transmit the virus to others. To protect yourself and others from COVID-19, CDC continues to recommend that you wear the most protective mask you can, that fits well and that you will wear consistently. [Learn about the types of masks.](https://www.parkview.com/community/dashboard/helpful-guidance-and-updates-on-mask-wearing) People, including children older than two, should wear a mask in indoor public places if they are: - Not fully vaccinated - Fully vaccinated and in an area with substantial or high transmission - Fully vaccinated and with weakened immune systems In general, you do not need to wear a mask in outdoor settings. In areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, consider wearing a mask in crowded outdoor settings and for activities with close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated. I don't know enough about the long-term effects of the vaccine. Although the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are the newest vaccines available to prevent illness from respiratory viruses, the technology of mRNA vaccines has been around for a long time. The original clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines were conducted in 2020, and since then more than 536 million doses have been given in the U.S. to date. Due to the widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. and worldwide since December 2020, the FDA has accumulated an unprecedented amount of safety monitoring data. Additionally, the outstanding long-term safety record of other respiratory virus vaccines provides a great deal of reassurance. It is important to understand that vaccines are fundamentally different than medications taken regularly to treat health conditions in terms of long-term safety. Vaccines, given as a one- or two-dose series, are only in the body for a few days before being broken down in the tissues and cells at the injection site, and the side effects of any COVID-19 vaccine are related to immune response to the viral S-spike protein provided by the vaccine. For example, the very rare adverse effects that may occur, such as inflammation of the heart (myocarditis, which occurs in about 1 in 50,000 people), are due to the body's immune response to the S-spike virus protein and occur within days to weeks after vaccination. In general, no rare immune reaction effects occur from vaccination beyond eight weeks after administration. Vaccines do not accumulate in the body and are not taken on a daily or weekly basis like other medications for health problems, so vaccines do not create long-term effects. Is the children's vaccine the same as the adult vaccine? A dose of the Pfizer vaccine for children ages 5-11 contains one-third the amount of active ingredient used in the vaccine for those 12 and older. Children will need a second dose 21 days or more after their first shot. Although the Parkview COVID-19 Vaccine Clinic isn't offering vaccine for children ages 5-11 at this time, vaccines for young children are available at many pediatric healthcare provider offices, pharmacies, Federally Qualified Health Centers and more. PPG Statement for patients At Parkview Physicians Group, we care about your health and would encourage our patients to be vaccinated for COVID-19 as they qualify to receive the vaccine. The vaccine is effective and safe. There are very few contraindications to receiving the vaccine and even those that have had COVID-19 should receive the vaccine. Severe reactions to the vaccine are very rare (about 11 per 1 million persons receiving the vaccine). Along with the CDC, PPG considers a history of the following to be a contraindication to vaccination with both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines: - Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components - Immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components (including polyethylene glycol [PEG]) - Immediate allergic reaction of any severity to polysorbate (due to potential cross-reactive hypersensitivity with the vaccine ingredient PEG) - Monoclonal antibody infusion within the last 90 days The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that COVID-19 vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant individuals who meet criteria for vaccination based on ACIP-recommended priority groups. Pregnant women may wish to discuss vaccination with their provider. Vaccine eligibility in our region is set by state departments of health.

[Additional Sources of Information](#accordionMenu6) How do I know which sources of COVID-19 vaccine information are accurate? There is a lot of confusing information regarding COVID-19 immunity and vaccine safety, and it can be difficult to know which sources to trust. Before considering vaccine information on the internet, check that the information comes from a credible source and is updated regularly. Throughout the pandemic, misinformation has been produced and amplified by fringe political groups and foreign actors, and consists of false or misleading claims regarding COVID-19 vaccines and other treatment and prevention measures. Think before posting or sharing content on social media or in emails. Watch out for emotionally manipulative content designed to make us angry or sad, or that use sensational terms designed to divide us and promote mistrust. Additional questions?
