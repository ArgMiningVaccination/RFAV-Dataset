In the early 19th century, a major emphasis in higher education was on the study of Greek and Latin, with littleattention to modern or contemporary subjects. The founders of NewYork University intended to enlarge the scope of higher education to meet the needs of persons aspiring to careers in business, industry,science, and the arts, as well as in law, medicine, and the ministry.The opening of the University of London in 1828 convinced NewYorkers that their city, too, should have a university. The first president of New York University's governing council was Albert Gallatin, former adviser to Thomas Jeffersonand secretary of the treasury in Jefferson's cabinet. Gallatin andhis cofounders said that the new university was to be a \"nation-al university\" that would provide a \"rational and practical edu-cation for all.\" The result of the founders' foresight is today a universi- ty that is recognized both nationally and internationally as aleader in scholarship. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and uni-versities in America, only 60 institutions are members of the dis-tinguished Association of American Universities. New YorkUniversity is one of the 60. Students come to the Universityfrom all 50 states and from 140 foreign countries. The University includes 14 schools and colleges at six major centers in Manhattan. In addition, the University operatesbranch campus programs in Westchester County at Manhat-tanville College and in Rockland County at St. Thomas AquinasCollege. Certain of the University's research facilities, notablythe Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, are located inSterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York. Although overall theUniversity is large, the divisions are small- to moderate-sizedunits\u2014each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty. Enrollment in the undergraduate divisions ranges between 100 and 6,500. While some introductory classes insome programs have large numbers of students, many classes aresmall. More than 2,500 courses are offered, leading to more than25 different degrees. 6 INTRODUCTIONThe Schools and Colleges of the UniversityThe College of Arts and Science offers the Bachelor of Arts degree in awide range of programs in thehumanities, science, social sciences,and foreign languages and literaturesand, in some departments, the Bache-lor of Science degree.

Manager of College Information Systems Nicole Phillips Sharpe, B.A., M.A. Assistant to the Dean; Director of Fresh-man Orientation12 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE 13The history of the College of Arts and Science begins with the founding of the University by a number of prominent New Yorkers, led by Albert Gallatin, a mem-ber of Jefferson's cabinet. Unlike other institutions at the time, it was to be nonsec- tarian and to produce a different sort of elite citizen, not born to privilege but set apart forleadership by talent and effort. To that end it provided a more practical education, what the19th century called \"Useful Knowledge.\" Thus, in addition to offering the standard classical curriculum, early NYU was also a center for science. Samuel F. B. Morse, after whom the current core curriculum is named,invented the telegraph while teaching art and design; John W . Draper invented modernphotography; and the American Chemical Society was founded here. In the arts and culture, too, it can be argued that the College not only participated in but also generated much of the creative energy that has characterized Greenwich Village.The original University Building housed ateliers that were the forerunners of the currentdowntown art scene. And although Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was turned down for ateaching post, literature thrived, with University Building even featured in a 1861 novel byTheodore Winthrop. Finally, this neighborhood and this institution have had a long tradition of social and political activism\u2014from the Stonecutters Riot over the construction of the University'sfirst building in 1834 to the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, a major eventin U.S. labor history that took place in what is now the Brown Building. From its earliest days, then, the College on Washington Square has been at the cut- ting edge of intellectual, cultural, and social developments. In 1895, however, NYU's greatchancellor, Henry MacCracken, decided to reserve Washington Square for the professionalschools, which had proliferated under his leadership, and to move University College to abeautiful campus in the Bronx\u2014University Heights\u2014designed by Stanford White. The College's move to the Heights reflected MacCracken's \"Ivy\" aspirations for the school and his successful effort to raise quality by attracting the best students nationally.Also relevant was the ascendant, nonurban collegiate ideal of a residential community, withfine teaching, extracurricular activities, fraternities, and intercollegiate athletics. A few years later an undergraduate presence was restored downtown with the open- ing of a Collegiate Division (1903), soon to become Washington Square College (1913).This school had a more diverse student body, opening its doors to women, recent immi-grants, commuters, and professional students. For over 60 years, undergraduate liberal arts education at NYU took place in two locations\u2014University College (and the Engineering School) at the Heights and the College onWashington Square, both offering excellent, but different, educational and social experiences.A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE College of Arts and Science 14 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCEIn the 1970s the College underwent yet another major transformation. Inresponse to financial pressures, theHeights campus closed in 1973, andUniversity College merged withWashington Square College. The new institution, which is nowknown simply as the College of Artsand Science, is the beneficiary ofboth traditions\u2014the Heights' resi-dential and collegiate culture andthe Square's progressive urban focus.At that time, a decision was alsomade to build aggressively for quality\u2014to recruit the very best faculty and students, to update andexpand the physical plant, and tocreate distinguished programs bothhere and abroad. In recent years the College has become recognized as a nationalleader for its efforts to reinvent a lib-eral arts education for the 21st centu-ry. With a challenging liberal artscore, the Morse Academic Plan, atthe center of its curriculum, theCollege emphasizes student inquiryand research, offers unique opportu-nities for international and preprofes- sional study, and makes use of thecity as a site for learning and service.A liberal arts education thus recon-ceived is not only personally enrich-ing but also eminently practical indeveloping the skills and perspectivesessential to assume a leadership rolein the 21st century. As the new mil-lennium proceeds, the College con-tinues to build on its founders' goalof providing \"Useful Knowledge.\" COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE 15 COLLEGE DIRECTORY 17College Directory Administrators Matthew S.

Classification of CoursesThe bulletin contains descriptions of the College's departments, programs,and courses. Each course is assigneda letter prefix followed by a number.The prefix V indicates undergradu-ate courses offered in the College; Gindicates a graduate course offeredby the Graduate School of Arts andScience. Graduate courses open to qualified undergraduates are designated by thedepartments. The departmental policyin this matter may be indicated in this bulletin or in the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science section ofthe directory of classes, which isavailable during each registrationperiod. Hyphenated courses (e.g., V77.0101-0102) are full-year cours-es. Each term is registered for indi-vidually, but no credit is granted forcompleting only the first term of thefull-year course. In the designationof a course where the numbers indi- cating each half of the course areseparated by a comma, not a hyphen,credit will be granted for complet-ing only the first term of the courseunless it is indicated otherwise.Students should be aware that in cer-tain of these courses, satisfactorycompletion of the first term of thecourse is a prerequisite for entry intothe second term of the course.HEGIS* numberHEGIS* numberHEGIS* numberMORSE ACADEMIC PLAN 23The Morse Academic Plan (MAP) of the College of Arts and Science is an integrated general education curriculum in the liberal arts. The MAP is named for Samuel F. B.Morse, an early faculty member of the University. Best known as inventor of the electric telegraph, Morse taught fine arts at NYU and was an eminent painter. In hisbreadth of talent and high achievement as both an artist and scientist, Morse symbolizes therange of skills and interests that the MAP is designed to foster. The MAP provides a core academic experience for undergraduates at NYU. Through a challenging array of foundational courses the program heightens cultural aware-ness, hones critical reading skills, promotes creative and logical thinking, and gives studentsextensive practice writing and speaking English and proficiency in at least one other lan-guage. Rather than specifying a fixed canon of knowledge, the MAP focuses on modes andmethods of humanistic and scientific inquiry. In each case, students are free to pursue par-ticular interests by choosing among a number of courses. Students examine our contempo-rary culture\u2014its origins and social structures, its modes of expression, and its inherentdiversity and evolving patterns of thought. In other classes, they consider the place andimportance of modern science\u2014its quantitative and analytical foundations, its processes ofreasoning, and its relationship to technology and to our views of the natural world. By help-ing them to broaden their perspectives, gain new pathways for intellectual inquiry, anddevelop the skills, background, and social awareness to thrive in dynamic circumstances, theMAP thus seeks to prepare students for their later studies and to equip them well for livesas thinking individuals and members of society.The Morse Academic Plan DIRECTOR OF THE MORSE ACADEMIC PLAN: Associate Professor Borenstein DIRECTOR OF THE EXPOSITORY WRITINGPROGRAM: Professor Hoy Program The MAP has four components: (1) the Expository WritingProgram, (2) study of foreign language, (3) the Foundations ofContemporary Culture (FCC), and (4) the Foundations of ScientificInquiry (FSI). Though structured and integrat- ed, the MAP curriculum affords stu-dents flexibility in a number ofways. It permits the following: choice of different tracks in eachcomponent, satisfaction of some courses byexamination or Advanced Placementcredit (foreign language, FSI), and substitution of departmentalcourses (FCC, FSI). Given this flexibility, students work individually with advisers toplan course schedules that take intoaccount, among other things, theirpast preparation, current interests,and longer-term goals. While thereis no prescribed schedule of coursesthat will be appropriate for everystudent, the following broad guide-lines should be kept in mind. Incoming freshmen should nor-mally complete their MAP coursesby the end of sophomore year. Thiswill leave them free in the junior and senior years to focus on theirmajor and elective courses. Somescience majors, engineering stu-dents, premedical students, and stu-dents placed in the InternationalWriting Workshop sequence may need to delay starting, and thus fin-ishing, a component of the MAP fora semester or more. Students whopursue international study may alsoneed to delay completing theirMAP courses beyond the sophomoreyear. Students must complete Writingthe Essay, V40.0100, during their24 MORSE ACADEMIC PLANfirst year. Those placed into the Prose Writing or InternationalWriting Workshop sequences must begin in their first semester andmust register for their remainingwriting course(s) in the semester(s)immediately following. Although Freshman HonorsSeminars, V50.02xx, are not a partof the MAP , qualifying students arestrongly urged to register for one of these classes in their first semester.These seminars with distinguishedfaculty members promise an intel-lectually stimulating experienceright at the start of college. In designing the MAP , the facultysought to assure that all studentswould receive a broad exposure tothe liberal arts early in their collegecareers. With this wide academic horizon, the MAP encourages stu-dents to discover new intellectualinterests outside their intended areasof specialization and to pursue thoseinterests with elective courses out-side their majors in their laterundergraduate years. Expository WritingIt would be difficult to exaggerate the value of clear and effective writ-ing. The Expository WritingProgram at NYU assumes that writ-ing is not merely a useful skill butalso a way of learning and knowing.Its courses focus on the examinationof evidence, the development ofideas, and the clear expression ofthose ideas in a variety of differentkinds of essays. In these writing courses students routinely movefrom exploration to argument asthey read and make use of varioustexts\u2014written, visual, experien-tial\u2014to create a spectrum of persua-sive essays. Examined texts becomemore complex, the writing tasksmore difficult as students grapplewith intriguing questions that leadto richer ideas and more interesting forms of expression. The essays stu-dents write become more formal andargumentative as the semester'swork progresses. For a complete description of the curriculum, see the Expository Writing Program (40) section of this bulletin. Foreign LanguageThe study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts educa-tion. It nurtures an awareness of thediversity of human culture andserves the practical need for languageskills in fields such as government,business, and research. New YorkUniversity is a particularly excitingsetting for language study because ofits location in a great cosmopolitancity, its international student body,its many renowned language pro-grams and centers, and its numerousopportunities for study abroad. In addition to the foreign lan- guage courses offered for academiccredit, the College offers opportuni-ties for students of modern languagesto practice their skills in real-worldsituations outside the classroom.NYU Speaking Freely is a free, non-credit program that allows studentsto practice their speaking and auralcomprehension skills and to explorethe linguistically diverse cultures ofNew York City. For more informationabout this popular program, contactthe Office of the Associate Dean forStudents, Silver Center, Room 909. Increasingly, college graduates must be prepared to function in aglobal society. Apart from the inher-ent interest of learning about othercultures, many NYU students takethe opportunity to study or travelabroad as preparation for their futurecareers. For more information aboutStudy Abroad Programs, visit the NYU Study Abroad office, 7 East 12th Street, 6th floor, and consultthe Programs Abroad section of this bulletin. Requirement. To fulfill the for- eign language component of theMorse Academic Plan, studentsmust show or attain proficiency in aforeign language through the inter-mediate level. Ordinarily, this isaccomplished by the successful com-pletion of two years of languagestudy in the College, through thesecond semester of a regular inter-mediate-level language sequence.Some languages are also taught inintensive courses, allowing studentsto complete the equivalent of twoyears of study in a single year. After two years of college lan- guage study or the equivalentdemonstrated proficiency, studentsshould have gained a broad compe-tence in a language; but true fluencyof written or oral expression will notusually have been developed at thispoint. For this reason, all studentsare encouraged to continue their lan-guage study beyond the intermedi-ate level. In particular, studentsstudying modern languages will findit most beneficial to immerse them-selves in the living culture of a lan-guage by studying, traveling, orworking abroad. Likewise, studentsof all languages, whether ancient ormodern, are encouraged to continuetheir studies with elective courses inliterature at the advanced level.Exemptions. Students may fulfill the foreign language component ofthe MAP by presenting outstandingscores on the SAT II or AdvancedPlacement Examinations or by pass-ing a departmental proficiency exam-ination. For further information onlanguage placement and exemption,see under \"Placement Examinations\"in the Academic Policies section of this bulletin. For Advanced PlacementExamination equivalencies, consultthe chart in the Admissions section,also in this bulletin. Students whose secondary schooling was in a language otherthan English and other than a lan-guage offered in the College, or whocomplete the International WritingWorkshop sequence (V40.0004, V40.0009), are exempt from theforeign language requirement. Alsoexempt are students in the B.S./B.E.program. Courses. Listed below are cours- es covering the second semester ofthe intermediate level of languagestudy. Intensive courses, whichallow students to complete theequivalent of two years of study in asingle year, are also listed whereavailable.

For information aboutthese courses, visit the Office ofAcademic Affairs, Silver Center,Room 908. Foundations of Contemporary CultureThe Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of theMorse Academic Plan is a series offour coordinated courses in thehumanities and social sciences.Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their par-ticular interests through theirchoice of individual classes. Overall,the structure of the FCC ensuresthat every student in the Collegegains a common core of skills andexperiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information on the Foundations of ContemporaryCulture provided in this bulletin,detailed descriptions of each year'scourse offerings may be found in theMAP brochure, published annuallyas a supplement to this bulletin.CONVERSATIONS OF THE WEST Through exploration of contrasting and complementary works in thehumanities from different periods,Conversations of the West provides ahistorical, literary, and philosophicalcontext for education in the liberalarts. Students may choose from fourtracks: Antiquity and the MiddleAges, Antiquity and theRenaissance, Antiquity and theEnlightenment, and Antiquity andthe 19th Century. In each case, theclasses begin with works from someof the ancient civilizations that haveshaped the development of culturesin the West. Typically, the classeshave the following readings in com-mon: the books of Genesis andExodus from the Hebrew Scriptures,the Gospel According to Luke andActs of the Apostles from theChristian New Testament, a Platonic dialogue and a Sophoclean orEuripidean tragedy, Virgil's Aeneid, and Augustine's Confessions. In the second half of the course, the themesand ideas emerging from these textsare followed as they are maintained,reinterpreted, or disputed by laterthinkers. Conversations of the West is not a survey but, rather, an examination ofhow texts influence subsequent think-ing, create traditions, and reflect soci-etal ideals. Conversations of the Westthus aims to provide a richer under-standing of how cultures are con-structed, modified, and represented. WORLD CULTURES The World Cultures courses intro-duce students to the ways in whichcultural traditions are created andthe ways in which cultures define26 MORSE ACADEMIC PLANthemselves against internal and external alternatives. These coursesintroduce students to the methodsand problems of cultural studies.Like Conversations of the West,World Cultures is not intended as a set of historical surveys. Each courseis designed to examine the chal-lenges of \"translation\"\u2014of appreci-ating cultural traditions other thanone's own; to introduce students tothe major texts, artifacts, and valuesof another cultural tradition; and todevelop a sense of the diversity andsimilarity of the ways in which peo-ple in different cultural traditionsunderstand, experience, and imaginetheir lives. SOCIETIES AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES Over the past several centuries, enormous social transformationshave taken place around the world. To understand the complexity of these phenomena, new methodshave been developed to study soci-etal structures and human behavior.Each of the courses under Societiesand the Social Sciences begins froma particular disciplinary approach,social concern, or topic, in order toorient students to the characteristicmethods of these social sciences.Students learn how issues are objec-tified for study, how data are col-lected and analyzed, and how newunderstanding is thereby achieved.Whether through an interdiscipli-nary approach, consideration of theirhistorical development, or reflectionon critical and positivistic debates,the courses help students both toappreciate the unique insightsafforded by these methods and torecognize the limits of such inquiry.In this way, students move beyondthe particular focus of the class to a broader understanding of methodsand problems in the social sciencesgenerally. EXPRESSIVE CULTURE In Expressive Culture studentsexplore the complexities of artisticexpression by focusing on one of fivemedia: sounds, images, words, per-formance, or film. Each courseintroduces requisite historical, for-mal, and critical vocabularies; exam-ines fundamental issues associatedwith interpretation of the arts mak-ing use of these media; and investi-gates the complex relations betweenartistic activity and other facets ofsocial organization. The courses alsomake use, whenever possible, of therich cultural resources of New YorkCity. Foundations of Scientific InquiryThe Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) component of the MorseAcademic Plan is a series of threecoordinated courses in quantitativereasoning and the natural sciences.Together, these courses ensure that every student in the College gains afundamental understanding of howmathematics and laboratory experi-mentation advance scientific investi-gation. While some students acquirethis background through coursework offered in the science majors,FSI courses are especially designed tomeet the need of nonscience stu-dents. Within each of the three offer-ings, students are free to pursue theirparticular interests through theirchoice of individual classes. In addition to the information on the Foundations of Scientific Inquiryprovided in this bulletin, detaileddescriptions of each year's courseofferings may be found in the MAPbrochure, published annually as asupplement to this bulletin. QUANTITATIVE REASONING Students in Quantitative Reasoningengage mathematical concepts in avariety of contexts in the natural orsocial sciences. All courses include a substantial amount of problem solv-ing that requires both conceptualand computational work. NATURAL SCIENCE I Scientific knowledge has its basis inour natural curiosity about theworld around us and our place in it.These courses approach the physicalsciences with the intent of askingand trying to answer interestingquestions, dealing with topics rang-ing from the origin of our universeand planet to how human activityaffects our environment. Studentsconsider the important roles playedby laws of physics and chemistry inbiology, earth and environmentalsciences, astrophysics, and cosmolo-gy and develop an understanding ofhow the physical sciences inform thenatural sciences generally.Mathematics is introduced in eachcourse with frequent applications tothe subject matter. Predictions thatcan be made only with the use ofmathematics are clearly delineated,showing the powerful role it playsin our understanding of the uni-verse. Wherever possible, the cours-es relate science to societal problems and develop a historical perspective. NATURAL SCIENCE II The complexity of the biologicalrealm continues to fascinate andchallenge modern scientists, who arecurrently engaged in such diversepursuits as exploring the organiza-tion and function of the brain,reconstructing the origin of thehuman species, linking the multi-plicity of interactions in ecosystems,and deciphering the influence ofheredity on complex traits. Thecourses in Natural Science II take anontraditional approach to the lifesciences, with an emphasis onapproaching science as a dynamicprocess of investigation and discov-ery. Each course selects a broadtheme that is at the forefront of con-temporary research, then uses specif-ic questions and examples to intro-duce students to the methodology ofscientific inquiry, the critical evalua-tion of results, and the mathemati-cal tools used to quantify scientificinformation.AFRICANA STUDIES 27The Program in Africana Studies offers a wide range of courses on the black experi- ence in the modern world, emphasizing the interdisciplinary approach of culturalstudies. The program's two main areas are Pan-African history and thought and black urban studies. Pan-African history and thought includes the study of such literary andpolitical movements as the Harlem Renaissance, the Negritude movement, black con-sciousness, black feminism, and black intellectual leaders such as W . E. B. Du Bois, ZoraNeale Hurston, C. L. R. James, Malcolm X, Angela Davis, Leopold Senghor, and KwameNkrumah. Black urban studies focuses on the cultural analysis of black people's relations toa wide range of social, cultural, and political institutions such as museums, public offices,music and sports industries, mass media, the police, and public schools. Black urban stud-ies also explores patterns of black migration, black cultural productions, and questions ofclass and gender dynamics within black communities. New York's position as an international crossroads allows the program to bring prestigious scholars and artists for visits of six weeks to one year. Students, faculty, andmembers of the surrounding community interact with such guests through courses, presen-tation of works in progress, and performances in order to capture the international dimen-sion of Pan-Africanism.PROGRAM IN Africana Studies (11) 269 MERCER STREET, SUITE 601, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687. 212-998-2130.

The ASP's core and affiliated faculty members,drawn from many FAS and TSOA departments and programs, constitute one of NYU's strongest faculty groupings. The program interprets \"American\" in a broad sense toinclude assessments of the historical role of the United States in the Americas and, moregenerally, in world affairs. Inasmuch as the program has a regional focus and a distinctiveedge among other American Studies Programs, special attention is given to studies inurbanism and to New York in particular, a global city that comprises many world cultures.PROGRAM IN American Studies (13) 285 MERCER STREET, 8TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687. 212-998-8538.

HISTORY Seminar: Historicizing American Popular CultureV13.0699 Identical to V57.0699.The chief intent of this minor is to allow students the possibility of significant and structured interdisciplinary work in ancient studies. The adviser for the minor (inconsultation with faculty from the student's major department) is responsible for ensuring that each student's experience remains cohesive. Nonetheless, this minor adheresto the principle of flexibility and inclusiveness. Each student will build the sort of experi-ence that is most appropriate to his or her needs or desires. This means that the boundaries(temporal, spatial, conceptual) will remain permeable. Each student's course of study isdesigned on an individual basis, guided by the student, the student's adviser in his or herown major department, and the adviser from the ancient studies minor. A number of CAS departments and programs, as well as institutes and centers, are directly involved in this program: anthropology, classics, comparative literature, East Asianstudies, English, fine arts, Hebrew and Judaic studies, history, Irish studies, linguistics,Middle Eastern and Islamic studies, and the Alexander S. Onassis Program in HellenicStudies. The minor consists of five 4-point courses, normally to be selected from the appro-priate offerings of the departments listed above. All five of the courses selected must beoffered by departments other than the student's major department, and not more than twomay be taken in any one department. Students are furthermore expected to examine at least three different civilizations or cultures in completing this minor. Language courses may not be used to fulfill therequirements of this minor. It is also required that students who choose this minor com-plete, as a capstone experience, an independent study course. The adviser for the ancientstudies minor may assist students in designing a project and in finding an appropriate fac-ulty member to direct this independent study. All programs must be approved by theancient studies adviser before the student begins to take courses that would fulfill the minorrequirements.PROGRAM IN Ancient Studies Minor 25 WAVERLY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790. 212-998-8592. ADVISER: Professor Peachin (Classics) 32 ANCIENT STUDIESANTHROPOLOGY 33The Department of Anthropology is one of the country's leading graduate and under- graduate centers for cultural anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthropology,and biological anthropology\u2014the four principal subfields of anthropology studied in the undergraduate curriculum. The department considers its greatest assets to be the var-ious individual areas of faculty expertise: archaeological specialties such as European, NearEastern, and South Asian prehistory; biological anthropology areas such as molecular pri-matology, primate behavior and ecology, and paleoanthropology; linguistic anthropologyfoci such as discourse analysis and language socialization; and cultural anthropology spe-cialties such as the ethnography of North America, Africa, India, China, the Near and Mid-dle East, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and the South Pacific. Major the-oretical emphasis is on the systems of thought and symbolic representation of the self andsociety; the relation between female and male domains of interaction; changing patterns ofsocial organization and hierarchy within small-scale societies, urban settings, and bureau-cratic institutions; medical anthropology; science studies; race and ethnicity; and the prob-lem of ethnographic representation in film and other media. Departmental resources include an extensive film and video collection as well as teaching and research labs for archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological anthro-pology, which can be used for research by advanced undergraduates. A regular colloquiumseries and an undergraduate student association welcome undergraduate participation. For-mal and informal cooperative arrangements with museums, zoos, and other academic pro-grams in the greater New York area place at students' disposal a group of anthropologicalscholars, materials, and resources unparalleled in this country.DEPARTMENT OF Anthropology (14) 25 WAVERLY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790. 212-998-8550. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Myers DIRECTOR OF UNDER-GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Disotell FacultyProfessor Emeritus: Lynch David B. Kriser Professor of Professor, Professor Rockefeller, Schuldenrein,Sutton, Weatherford Program FIELDS OF INQUIRY Cultural anthropology is the study ofsocial organization and the systemsof thought and values that bothreflect and inform social practice in different cultures. Cultural anthro-pology is interdisciplinary in orienta-tion, analyzing and synthesizing reli-gious, artistic, economic, and politi- cal practices through the commonmedium of culture. Traditionallycultural anthropology emphasized34 ANTHROPOLOGYthe study indigenous,and/or peoples). Contem-porary anthropology maintains suchinterests but increasingly applies itsinsights and methods to complex,urban, and industrialized societies.An emphasis of the department isthe ethnographic study of cultural,social, and political processes thatshape our lives and those of otherpeople, especially as we are drawntogether and influence one anotherin increasingly transnational andglobal interactions. The department participates in the University's Hagop KevorkianCenter for Near Eastern Studies, theCenter for Latin American andCaribbean Studies, the Institute ofFrench Studies, the Program inMuseum Studies, the Program inCulture and Media, and the Centerfor Media, Culture, and History. Linguistic anthropology focuses on how language is interpreted andused in cultural contexts. Languageuse is socially organized; it is a keyto understanding the ways in whichspeakers create and change socialrealities. Studied within historical aswell as cultural frameworks and inrelation to other social institutions(e.g., politics, education, law, medi-cine), variation in ways of speakinglanguage(s) adds to our understand-ing of how social categories such asethnicity, race, and gender are inter-actionally constituted across con-texts, cultures, and societies. Anthropological archaeology is the use of artifacts and other materialremains to understand human cul-ture. It attempts to breathe life intoa material record that at first glanceappears static and fragmentary. Theresearch interests of anthropologicalarchaeologists range from the earliestproduction of durable tools 2.5 mil-lion years ago to the refuse currentlybeing generated by modern cities.All aspects of past human existence,including art, technology, religion,gender, economic and social organi-zation, and food-getting strategies,are addressed by researchers inanthropological archaeology. Physical anthropology encom- passes the study of primate biologi-cal diversity and includes the anato-my, genetics, behavior, ecology, andevolution of humans and other pri-mates. It is linked to the other sub-fields of anthropology by its com-mitment to the study of humanbiology and evolution within the context of culture, society, and ecol-ogy. Close ties with the AmericanMuseum of Natural History, theNew York University School ofMedicine, and the Wildlife Conser-vation Society International Pro-grams at the Bronx Zoo facilitatethe department's diverse researchinterests in physical anthropology. DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES Anthropology courses contribute to undergraduate education in twoways. First, the scope of the disci-pline's interests effectively bridgesthe humanities, the social sciences,and the natural sciences. Anthropolo-gy asks basic questions concerningthe origins and development ofhumans and their cultures and diver-gent systems of thought, belief, andsocial order. By systematically ana-lyzing various cultural traditions\u2014contemporary as well as historicallyknown\u2014anthropology raises criticalquestions concerning the bases ofboth world civilizations. An under-standing of the distinctive wayanthropology formulates andattempts to answer its basic ques-tions is a necessary component of acomprehensive liberal education. Second, the department offers concentrated programs of study forthe minor, major, or honors student.A minor usually emphasizes one ofthe four subdisciplines. For themajor, the department encouragesstudy in all of the subdisciplines,because each supplements and com-plements the others in presentinghumans as both biological and socialbeings. An honors program includesin-depth research and writing in oneaspect of physical, archaeological,linguistic, or cultural anthropology. The director of undergraduate studies works closely with minorsand majors students in designingprograms of study that integratesthe goals of individual students withthe offerings and intellectual goalsof the department and complemen-tary disciplines. The department prides itself on its graduate and undergraduate pro-grams' integrated nature, whichenables minors, majors, and honorsstudents to participate in a variety ofchallenging graduate courses andseminars. There is an active Anthro-pology Undergraduate StudentAssociation (AUSA) that connectsstudents to one another through events and e-mail forum (listserv). MAJOR The major consists of 36 points,which include V14.0001, V14.0002,V14.0003, and V14.0017 (which isoffered only during the springsemester). The other courses may beselected from any subfield of anthro-pology. Internships approved by theDirector of Undergraduate Studies,however, may not be applied towardthe major, and a grade of at least C isrequired in every course to be count-ed toward the major. Any coursewith a grade of C- or lower will notcount toward the major. Majorsshould consult regularly with thedirector of undergraduate studies inorder to take full advantage of theseminars and research opportunitiesopen to them. Joint Major with the Depart- ment of Classics: An interdepart- mental major including courses fromthe Department of Anthropologyand the Department of Classics. Oneanthropology course, V14.0001, isrequired, along with four otheranthropology courses taken in con-sultation with the directors of under-graduate studies in both depart-ments. Twenty (20) points arerequired in Classics. See Classics (27) for additional information. A gradeof at least C is required in everycourse to be counted toward thejoint major. Joint Major with the Depart- ment of Linguistics: The joint major in anthropology and linguisticsemphasizes the complementarity ofanthropological and sociolinguisticapproaches to language. Students arerequired to take 20 points (five cours-es) each from anthropology and lin-guistics. A grade of at least C isrequired in every course to be countedtoward a joint major. Required cours-es in anthropology: Human Societyand Culture, V14.0001; Anthropolo-gy of Language, V14.0017; Symbol-ism, Meaning, and Social Life,V14.0048; two other cultural orlinguistic anthropology coursesapproved undergraduate studies.

The \"principles\" courses (V14.0001,V14.0002, and V14.0003) are rec-ommended as overviews of the disci-pline and as prerequisites for moreadvanced courses. Minors consultwith the director of undergraduatestudies to design a program that bestaccommodates their interests. Agrade of C- or lower will not counttoward the minor.HONORS PROGRAM A degree in anthropology is awardedwith honors to selected majors whoapply for admission to the programthrough the director of undergradu-ate studies during their sophomoreor junior year. Honors program can-didates are expected to maintain anoverall grade point average of 3.5with an average of 3.5 in the major.Candidates for the honors programcomplete 10 courses for a total of 40points of anthropology course work.Two honors tracks are available. The first, typically followed by studentsconcentrating in sociocultural or lin- guistic anthropology, consists of twosenior honors seminars with substan-tial research and writing compo-nents. The second track, typicallyfollowed by those concentrating inbiological or archaeological anthro-pology, includes two research cours-es, V14.0950 and V14.0951, inwhich a research project is carriedout, and a special Seminar inAnthropology (V14.0800 orV14.0801) or a graduate course.

Consult the current Grad- uate School of Arts and Science Bulletin. The Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program provides an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the history and contemporary experiences of Asian/Pacific Amer-icans in the Americas. The category of Asian/Pacific American includes people of East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands living in the United States aswell as in other parts of the Americas. This program takes a critical community studiesapproach that uses field research as the central methodology to examine the relationshipbetween theory and practice and between structure and agency in the study of A/PA com-munities. Students develop important analytical skills that will help them negotiate today'smultiracial, multiethnic environment, as well as gain a level of cross-cultural awareness andskills that will be useful to them in any field of study they choose to enter. The two main areas of concentration for this program are urban studies and dias- pora studies. Urban studies examines the formation of A/PA communities in relation to thevarious cultural, social, and political institutions in urban settings, with special emphasis onthe New York metropolitan area. Diaspora studies investigates the processes that enableA/PA communities in the United States to sustain ties with communities throughout theworld. To study these two areas of concentration, the program insists on an interdisciplinaryapproach that takes into consideration analyses of cultural production\u2014social, political, andeconomical processes\u2014as well as cross-cultural conflict and collaboration. In coordination with the program, the A/P/A Studies Institute brings renowned artists, scholars, writers, and activists to campus. This provides the opportunity for discus-sion, performance, and reflection with students, faculty, and community members.PROGRAM IN Asian/Pacific/American Studies (15) Minor 269 MERCER STREET, SUITE 609, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687. 212-998-3700. DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: is in theprocess of hiring faculty and develop-ing the major curricula. In addition to its full-time facul- ty, the program also draws on thewealth of expertise of teachers andpractitioners in New York City foradjunct faculty. Visiting faculty fromoutside the city also add to a richmix of perspectives and experience.MINOR Five courses offerings, at least one ofwhich must be a seminar or \"commu-nity projects\" course. Please contactthe program for updated courserequirements and course descriptions.INTERNSHIP PROGRAM The internship program comple-ments and enhances the formalcourse work of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program. Studentsintern at various Asian/Pacific Amer-ican organizations throughout thetristate metropolitan region. Intern-ships are a highly recommended, butnot required, component of theA/P/A Studies major sequence. Non-ASIAN/PACIFIC/AMERICAN STUDIES 39majors may also apply for internships through the A/P/A Studies Program.Asian/Pacific American CommunityStudies: Theories and Practices is theprerequisite to an internship/inde-pendent study. The goals of the internship are as follows: (1) to develop sound criticalthinking and communication skills; (2) to allow students to apply thetheory they have gained throughtheir course work; (3) to master the-ory and practice of collaboration indifferent communities; (4) to pro-vide students with the analyticaltools to examine the experiences ofAsian/Pacific Americans and diverse communities; (5) to assist studentsin exploring professional careerpaths; and (6) to become adept atworking with populations whosebackground might be different fromthe students'.

CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Petrie sor of Biology: Coruzzi Silver Professor, Professor of Biology:Desplan Margaret and Herman Sokol Associate Professor of Professors: Cameron, Daly, DeSalle,McCutcheon, Motley, Rosenbaum,Schuster, Tolias, Tully, Wheeler Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES The science of biology concerns itself with the workings of life in all itsvaried forms. Over the past severalyears, biology has been revolution-ized with the development of power-ful techniques in molecular and cel-lular biology, genomics, and bioin- formatics that are now being appliedto research across the spectrum of thescience, from genetics and differenti-ation to biomedicine, field studies,and animal behavior. The depart-ment's programs of study andresearch reflect this contemporaryview of biology.The department offers students the opportunity to explore the vari-ous areas of current biology in anintegrated yet diverse program thatbuilds from a solid foundation of thebasic elements of molecular and cel-lular biology, genetics, evolution,organ systems, and population stud-ies. Students are exposed to modernNote: The Department of Biology administers the earth and environ-mental science courses and minoroffered by the College. For moreinformation, see Earth and Environmental Science (49).BIOLOGY 41concepts, state-of-the-art approaches, and current methods of experimenta-tion in molecular biology and bio-chemistry within introductory cours-es taken at the very outset of theirstudies. A variety of intermediatecourses then provides in-depthexploration of the major areas ofbiology, from molecular genetics tofield biology. Advanced studentsmay register for graduate-level cours-es, which are most often given in thespecialized areas of faculty research.Many options are available to createindividualized programs of study,including a track in environmentalscience. For more information, seeEarth and Environmental Science (49).Courses are reviewed and updatedregularly to reflect the advancesmade in the biological sciences. This program provides outstand- ing preparation for careers in research,academia, medicine, dentistry, andrelated fields. Graduates of the depart-ment have a remarkable record of suc-cess in acceptance into professionalschools and in establishing notablecareers in the biomedical sciences. Other courses offered by the department are designed to acquaintnonscience majors with contempo-rary issues in biology. Such coursesare often topical, addressing prob-lems such as environmental pollu-tion, limits of the earth, and humanphysiology. Outstanding and highly moti- vated students are offered specialopportunities for honors work, inde-pendent study, summer laboratoryresearch, internships, and otherenhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projectsin faculty laboratories through themany formal and informal opportu-nities afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important research accomplishmentand contains several specializedresearch and laboratory facilities thatare integrated into the educationalprograms. These include the under-graduate Molecular Biology Labora-tory, the Scanning and TransmissionElectron Microscope Facility, and theTissue Culture Facility. Field studies are carried out at many regional sites. Students with questions about majoring or minoring in biologyshould visit the office of the Depart-ment of Biology. Those declaring amajor in biology are assigned a facul- ty adviser from the department; stu-dents meet with that professor todesign a program of study, determinecourse selections, and discuss careergoals. The faculty adviser is alsoavailable to provide guidance con-cerning the many options and oppor-tunities afforded by the departmentfor curricular enhancement, includ-ing research experiences. MAJOR (BACHELOR OF ARTS) The following courses (completed with grades of C or higher and a min-imum GPA of 2.0 in all coursesrequired by the major) are required:V23.0011-0012, V23.0021-0022,and Study, V23.0997, 0998, orInternship in Biology, V23.0980,0981, may be counted toward fulfill-ing the major requirements. To per-mit the maximal choice of appropriateadvanced courses, we strongly recom-mend that students take biology(V23.0011-0012), chemistry(V25.0101-0102, V25.0103-0104),and mathematics in their freshmanyear and V23.0021-0022 as sophomores. A number of graduate courses are available for undergraduate majorprograms. Programs of majors mustbe approved each term by a depart-ment adviser. Major with a minor in com- puter science: For students who wish to combine their biology train-ing with basic information on com-puter operations. Course require-ments are mathematics (V63.0121)and computer science (V22.0101,V22.0102, and V22.0201). It maybe necessary for some students totake 18 points per semester toaccommodate this minor. MINOR The following courses (completedwith grades of C or higher and aminimum GPA of 2.0 in all biologycourses) are required for a minor inbiology: V23.0011-0012, plusV23.0021-0022 (strongly recom-mended) or any two upper-level, 4- point courses. If V23.0021-0022 arenot taken for the minor, it is strong-ly recommended (but not required)that students still take V25.0101-0102 and V25.0103-0104. Alsostrongly recommended areV25.0243-0244 and V25.0245-0246. Students interested in a minorin biology should consult the direc-tor of undergraduate studies as earlyas possible in order to plan a courseof study that meets their needs. B.S./B.E.

CHEMISTRY 45The Department of Chemistry has a long tradition at the University, dating back well before the founding of the American Chemical Society at New York University in1876. Professor John W . Draper, the first president of the society and chair of the department, was an early pioneer in photography, working with Samuel F. B. Morse. The department has undertaken a major development plan, strengthening its facul- ty, instructional laboratories, course offerings, and research facilities in the areas of physical,biophysical, bioorganic, and theoretical chemistry. Research areas represented by facultymembers include experimental and theoretical biophysical and physical chemistry, inorganicchemistry, photochemistry, and organic and bioorganic chemistry. Qualified undergraduatesare encouraged to participate in research as early as their sophomore year of study. The depart-ment houses state-of-the-art laboratory facilities for its undergraduate chemistry courses. Majoring in chemistry at the College of Arts and Science provides strong prepara- tion for graduate study in chemistry; professional education in patent law, medicine, or den-tistry; and careers in industrial or pharmaceutical chemistry and biotechnology.DEPARTMENT OF Chemistry (25) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 1001, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8400. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Geacintov ASSOCIATE CHAIR OF THEDEPARTMENT: Professor Canary DIRECTOR OF UNDER-GRADUATE STUDIES: Adjunct Professor Cutler ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR Cutler Clinical Associate Professors: Callahan, Goldberg ,Halpin Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES Chemistry is the central natural sci- ence interfacing physics and mathe-matics with the life sciences. Knowl-edge of chemistry has always been fun-damental to the investigation of thephysical world as well as to an in-depth understanding of living sys-tems. The range of modern chemistryspans chemical physics, materials sci-ence, and molecular biology, mergingthe traditional divisions of analytical, organic, inorganic, and physical chem-istry. In its recent development, thedepartment is focusing its interest onphysical, biophysical, and bioorganicchemistry, exploiting interdisciplinaryareas of theory, materials science, andbiological chemistry. The departmenthas a large and active theoretical groupin the areas of chemical physics andbiomolecular modeling. Activeresearch areas in the departmentinclude cancer research, nanotechnolo-gy, spectroscopy, and combinatorial chemistry. Graduates of the depart-ment have found rewarding careersand achieved distinction in all phasesof scientific life, from basic research tocommercial product development. Thelate Gertrude Elion, a 1941 M.S. inchemistry from New York University,shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medi-cine and Physiology for her research inpharmaceutical chemistry. The department offers the major in chemistry and in biochemistry. A46 CHEMISTRYselection of elective advanced courses, undergraduate and graduate, can becombined to provide a broad, variedprogram of study in chemistry. Thedepartment also offers a number ofcourses for nonscience students andservice courses for students in theother schools. The programs of studyin chemistry prepare students forgraduate work toward the master'sdegree or the doctorate for careers inresearch, development, teachingand/or for further study in areas suchas medicine, dentistry, basic medicalsciences, and allied health careersincluding forensic science. In addition,both majors leave students well pre-pared to pursue patent law or, with aminor in economics, to enter the fieldof technology investment as well asmanagement in the chemical industry. The department offers special honors courses that satisfy the firsttwo years of chemistry required formajors and for the prehealth curricu-lum in medicine, dentistry, and soforth. Students need permissionfrom the department to register forthese courses, which are limited tosmall classes. Permission is based onseveral factors, including back-ground in both mathematics andphysics; performance in high schoolchemistry courses; and, if offered, aplacement examination. Studentsmay be eligible to enter the secondyear honors course (organic) basedon exceptional performance in theregular General Chemistry course. MAJORS Students thinking of majoring inchemistry or biochemistry are stronglyurged to seek course advisement fromthe Department of Chemistry as earlyin their academic careers as possible.Chemistry is a sequential subject withcourses building on earlier courses.Delay in taking certain key prerequi-site courses can make it impossible tocomplete a major in four years withoutsummer attendance. A grade of C or better in chem- istry and the other mandated coursesis required for the fulfillment of thechemistry or biochemistry major inthe department. Students who do nothave an average of 2.0 in departmen-tally required courses by the time theyhave completed 64 points in all cours-es may be asked to change their major. The major in chemistry builds ona core of required courses in chem- istry, physics, and mathematics. Therequired addition to thesecourses, two semesters of calculus andtwo semesters of general physics arerequired. A third semester of calculusor a course in linear algebra is strong-ly recommended as preparation forV25.0651. For students interested inpursuing chemistry on the graduatelevel or with an interest in theoreticalchemistry, the additional courses inmathematics are recommended. Theseinclude Calculus cal-culus V63.0121 and V63.0122, plusV63.0123. The core, described above,provides a basic background in chem-istry. Students normally are encour-aged to complete the courses in gen-eral chemistry, organic chemistry,physics, and calculus prior to entryinto physical chemistry in the thirdyear. Alternative programs are alsopossible. It is strongly advised, how-ever, that an advanced-level chemistrycourse be taken in the third year ofstudy, allowing at least three moresemesters to complete all majorrequirements. Undergraduate specialization in organic, biochemical, physical, ortheoretical chemistry may be accom-plished through combinations ofadvanced elective undergraduate andgraduate courses open to undergrad-uates. These courses should be cho-sen in consultation with the Depart-ment of Chemistry. For students interested in prepa- ration for careers in the chemicalindustry, there are several alterna-tives available. The major in chem-istry with a minor in economicsgives the student training in chem-istry with a business background. Students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or basic medicalsciences may wish to consider themajor in biochemistry. Additionalcourses in biology may be desirable for such students. The appropriatepreprofessional adviser should beconsulted for details. A grade of C orbetter is required for all courses ful-filling any major in the department. The Department of Chemistry offers the following majors: Major in chemistry: The mini- mum requirements, in addition tothe core courses cited above, arecompletion of Experimental Meth-ods, V25.0661, and two advancedelective courses. Major in biochemistry: The minimum requirements, in additionto the core courses cited above, areBiochemistry I and II, G25.1881,1882; Experimental Biochemistry,G25.1885; and Biophysical Chem-istry, G25.1814. Students in thismajor are reminded that these cours-es must be taken in the proper order.Careful course planning is requiredto ensure that this can be done with-in a normal four-year program. In addition to these majors, the department offers several programsand options that may be of interestto students: American Chemical Society Cer- tification: Students majoring in either chemistry or biochemistry maybe certified by the American Chemi-cal Society on graduation. Interestedstudents should consult with thedirector of undergraduate studiesregarding the additional courserequirements for this certification. Program in Chemistry-Chemical Engineering: The College of Arts and Science offers a joint B.S./B.E. pro-gram with Stevens Institute of Tech-nology. For students interested inchemistry, the program leads to theB.S. degree from New York Universi-ty and the B.E. (chemical or environ-mental engineering) from Stevens.Further information is available fromMr. Joseph Hemmes and Ms. AaraKupris Menzi in the College AdvisingCenter, Silver Center, 100 WashingtonSquare East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Bachelor of Science Degree: Stu- dents who complete the required corecourses plus Experimental Methods,V25.0661; three advanced electives inchemistry; SeniorHonors in 470996; and one course in computer sci- ence approved by the Department ofChemistry may elect to graduate withthe degree of Bachelor of Science(B.S.) instead of the Bachelor of Arts(B.A.). Students should note that theB.S. program is very difficult to com-plete within a normal four-year acade-mic program and that it confers noparticular advantage to students inpremedical or predental programs. MINOR Completion of any four 4-point cours-es numbered V25.0101 or higherconstitutes a minor in chemistry.Only three of the four courses mayalso be used to satisfy another depart-ment's major. No grade less than Cwill count, and an average of 2.0 orbetter in all chemistry courses isrequired. GENERAL INFORMATION Laboratory courses in chemistry:Due to the potential hazard of allchemical experimentation, safetygoggles must be worn at all times inthe laboratories. Laboratory equip-ment, which is lent to the studentfor the duration of the course, mustbe replaced by the student if it isdamaged or broken. Purchase cardsmust be acquired for this purposeand cost $25. Purchase cards may be obtained from the stockroom duringthe first week of the term. Unusedportions of the deposit are redeem-able. Students who do not returnborrowed laboratory equipment atthe end of a course are charged anadditional fee, and their grade maybe recorded as incomplete and notreleased until \"checkout\" is completed. Advanced standing: Students who have taken college-level coursesin secondary schools and who haveachieved a grade of 4 or 5 on theCollege Entrance Examination BoardAdvanced Placement Test will begranted advanced placement. Fordetails, see the section on theAdvanced Placement Program underAdmission. However, unless prior lab- oratory work is extensive, GeneralChemistry II Laboratory, V25.0104,or in exceptional cases, the FreshmanHonors Laboratory, V25.0112, mustbe taken before taking advancedchemistry courses such as OrganicChemistry I, V25.0243, and its labo-ratory. Advice about the appropriatecourse should be obtained from thedirector of undergraduate studies inthe department. Research: The department endeavors to make research opportu-nities available during the summerand the academic year to well-quali- fied students at all levels. In order toparticipate in research in the depart-ment, students must both meet theprerequisites for and register for theresearch courses Advanced IndividualStudy and Research, V25.0997,0998, or, if eligible, Senior Honorsin Chemistry, V25.0995, 0996. Ineither case, permission of the directorof undergraduate studies is requiredbefore registering in these courses. HONORS PROGRAM Candidates for a degree with honorsin chemistry must have an overallgrade point average of 3.5 and a gradepoint average of 3.5 in required cours-es for the chemistry or biochemistrydegree. They must take two semestersof Senior Honors in Chemistry, V25.0995, 0996. A senior thesis based on this work must be prepared,approved by the adviser, and present-ed at a special seminar in the springterm of the senior year. Studentsdesiring entry into the honors pro-gram must obtain the approval of thedirector of undergraduate studiesprior to the end of their junior year.For general requirements, please seeHonors and Awards.

AFRICANA STUDIES 50The Department of Cinema Studies at the Tisch School of the Arts holds a preeminent place among cinema studies programs in the country. Its approach to cinema studiesfocuses on the processes of understanding film and the moving image in its multiple cultural and interdisciplinary contexts. The undergraduate program treats the study of cinemaboth as an art form and as a form of mass culture. The study of film, as an art, is concernedwith the relationships among film style, narrative form, and the material practices that shapethe medium. The study of film as mass culture explores how film reflects societal values andprocesses of social change. The department offers courses in the history, theory, aesthetics, andcriticism of film, as well as film genres and techniques. Certain film courses given in the College of Arts and Science may also be approved for the major or minor. Most of the Tischcourses include extensive film screenings and are supplemented by a weekly cin\u00e9math\u00e8que.Students also have access to extensive film and film-related resources in the department'sGeorge Amberg Study Center. The video collection in the Bobst Library's Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media provides additional resources. Finally, various New York Cityinstitutions make this an extraordinary environment for cinema studies.DEPARTMENT OF Cinema Studies (72) Tisch School of the Arts 721 BROADWAY , 6TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6807. 212-998-1600; WWW .NYU.EDU/TISCH/CINEMA CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Associate Professor Straayer DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Program MAJOR The major in cinema studies con- sists of 40 points, divided into threeareas of study. Tier I consists of acore curriculum of five coursestaken in sequence. Tier II consists ofsmall lecture elective classes in theareas of film auteurs, genres, move-ments, national cinemas, televisionstudies, and special topics. Tier IIIconsists of large lecture classes infilm aesthetics, directors, and gen-res. Majors are required to completefive courses (20 points) in Tier I:Introduction to Cinema Studies (H72.0010); Film History (H72.0015); Film History andCulture (H72.0021); and an Under-graduate Advanced Seminar(H72.0700). In addition, they must complete a two-course distribution require-ment in film history from Tier II:one course in U.S. cinema, onecourse in non-U.S. cinema.

This broad interdisciplinary approach to these cultures that have had a major role in shaping Western values and thought provides anexcellent undergraduate education, and classics students go on to careers in education, law,medicine, business, and the media. The department offers courses both in the original languages and in English trans- lation. Several majors and minors are available, some in conjunction with other departments(history, fine arts, anthropology, Italian, medieval and Renaissance studies, and comparativeliterature) and with the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies. Academicinternships, an honors program, and individualized study are also available. Classroom instruction is supplemented by a variety of activities. In addition to lec- tures and field trips sponsored by a lively Classics Club, students have access to the superbcollections of antiquities at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, theAmerican Numismatic Society, and the Pierpont Morgan Library, as well as access to thedepartment's own collection of antiquities. Finally, various opportunities for travel andstudy abroad are available in Greece, Italy, and other Mediterranean sites.DEPARTMENT OF Classics (27) 25 WAVERLY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790. 212-998-8597. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor (1) Classics (Latin and ancient Greek): This major requires a total of 40 points of course work, to beselected from the departmentalofferings (N.B., courses in modernGreek do not count toward comple-tion of this major). The courses to becounted toward the major mustinclude, at least, either one advancedcourse in both ancient Greek andLatin or two advanced courses ineither of these languages. (2) Classical civilization: This major requires a total of 40 points ofcourse work, to be selected from thedepartmental offerings (N.B., cours-es in modern Greek do not count toward completion of this major).The courses to be counted towardthe major must include eitherancient Greek or Latin through thefull intermediate level (respectivelyV27.0010 or V27.0006, or theequivalent; N.B., students mustcomplete at least two languagecourses in residence at NYU). (3) Classics and fine arts (with emphasis on archaeology): This interdepartmental major requirestwo years of college-level ancientGreek or or the equivalent;Introduction Archaeology,V27.0305; and four 4-point coursesin fine arts (V43.0102, V43.0103, and two others selected from applic-able courses, including those inEgyptian and Near Eastern art).This is a flexible major designed toaccommodate special interests andrequirements. Advanced-level cours-es in practical archaeology may betaken for credit. (4) Classical civilization and anthropology: This interdepartmen- tal major may follow one of twotracks, each requiring 20 points fromthe Department of Anthropologyand 20 points from the Departmentof Classics. The first track focuses onarchaeology and requires V27.0305CLASSICS 53and four other 4-point courses in classical civilization or languages.The second track emphasizes culturalanthropology and classical civiliza-tion and requires V27.0143 and fourother 4-point courses in classical civ-ilization or languages. Additionalrequirements may be found underAnthropology (14). (5) Classical civilization and Hellenic studies: This major offers the possibility of two differenttracks. Both tracks require a total of40 points of course work. For a listof courses in Hellenic studies, seeAlexander S. Onassis Program in Hel-lenic Studies (56). TRACK A Here, students concentrate in classi-cal civilization. The major requiresancient Greek through the interme-diate level (four 4-point courses),two 4-point courses from the offer-ings in classical civilization, and four4-point courses offered through theAlexander S. Onassis Program inHellenic Studies.TRACK B This track requires modern Greekthrough the intermediate level (four4-point courses), two 4-point coursesfrom the offerings of the AlexanderS. Onassis Program in HellenicStudies, and four 4-point coursesfrom the offerings in classical civi-lization. ( Note: A student already proficient through the first- or sec-ond-year level of modern Greek willtake two or four courses in place ofthe first and/or second year of mod-ern Greek, with the consent of theappropriate faculty.) MINORS (1) Latin and Greek: This minor requires 20 points of course work, tobe selected from the offerings of thedepartment (N.B., courses in mod-ern Greek and Hellenic studies donot count toward completion of thisminor). As part of this minor, stu-dents must take either Latin orancient Greek at least to the fullintermediate level (V27.0006 orV27.0010, respectively). At leasttwo of the required courses in ancient Greek or Latin must betaken in residence at NYU. (2) Classical civilization: This minor requires 20 points of coursework, to be selected from the offer-ings in Latin, ancient Greek, or clas-sical civilization (N.B., courses inmodern Greek and Hellenic studiesdo not count toward completion ofthis minor). HONORS PROGRAM Students may receive a degree withhonors in classics or classical civi-lization. Honors recognition requiresa 3.5 average overall, an average of3.5 in all classics courses, and acompleted honors thesis, which maybe written as part of IndependentStudy, V27.0997, 0998, for 4 pointsunder the supervision of a depart-mental supervisor.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES Courses in classics offered in the Graduate School of Arts and Scienceare open to all undergraduates whohave reached the required advancedlevel of Greek or Latin languageinstruction.COMPARATIVE LITERATURE 55Comparative literature is an innovative, interdisciplinary major that allows students to explore literature and literary questions unfettered by national borders and institu-tional boundaries as well as to understand literature as a unique cultural form through investigating its relation to other cultural practices. In comparative literature, stu-dents develop a multifaceted critical approach that both emphasizes the integrity of litera-ture and expands on the understanding of textuality to include all cultural artifacts andmodes of thought that involve language and representation. The Department of ComparativeLiterature encourages students to pursue theoretical and philosophical modes of reading andto understand the importance of engaging texts in the original language by taking advancedcourses in a national literature and studying the practice of translation. To interrogate howliterature is enmeshed in nonliterary contexts, comparative literature majors develop exper-tise in relevant related disciplines such as art history, philosophy, history, anthropology, andcinema studies. Comparative literature departmental course offerings include lecture classesin world literature and interdisciplinary studies that provide a transition from MAP into themajor and small seminars where students work intensively with a distinguished faculty com-posed of scholars in African, Caribbean, Russian and Slavic, Latin American, Chinese, andJapanese areas as well as specialists in the European and Anglo-American traditions.DEPARTMENT OF Comparative Literature (29) 19 UNIVERSITY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4556. 212-998-8790. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Associate Professor Ruttenberg UNDER- GRADUATE STUDIES: Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES The undergraduate major is designed to foster serious work inliterature at the advanced level,while giving students a strong back-ground in critical and culturalanalysis and a keen ability to posequestions and write with lucidityand force. The major provides anideal intellectual site for students to draw connections across cultures,periods, genres, and disciplines in arigorous yet individually designedway. A comparative literature majorcould lead to the advanced study ofliterature at the graduate level butcould just as readily be a strongbasis for advanced degrees and/orcareers in publishing, journalism,international relations, internationallaw, cultural studies, medicine, phi- losophy, education, public policy,film and entertainment industries,the Internet, and computer software. GENERAL INFORMATION Many comparative literature majorswish to study literature in its inter-national contexts, having masteredone or more foreign literatures.56 COMPARATIVE LITERATUREHowever, such mastery is not required in all courses or of allmajors, and courses are open to awide range of nonmajors with eclec-tic and interdisciplinary interests. MAJOR To declare a major, a student must successfully complete one courseoffered by the Department of Com-parative Literature. The major hastwo tracks, each consisting of ten 4-point courses organized as follows: Track 1: Literature. This track includes the following courses: (1) Four courses originating in the Department of Comparative Lit-erature, including Introduction toComparative Literature and onejunior seminar when available. Thesefour courses must be taught by a fac-ulty member of the Department ofComparative Literature; they cannotbe cross-listed courses originating inanother department. (2) Four courses in a national lit- erature department at the 100 levelor above conducted in the languageof that literature (including the pre-requisite course). (3) Two courses in a related cul- tural field or discipline. Fields couldinclude history, art history, religion,philosophy, classics, politics, cinemastudies, and so on and could also beanother foreign language or literaryarea. If the national literaturedepartment selected for specializa-tion is English, these two courses must be in a foreign language. Thechoice of these courses will be madein consultation with the adviser toform a coherent intellectual fieldand a defined objective in the major. Track 2: Literary and Cultural Studies. Track 2 includes the fol- lowing requirements: (1) Four courses originating in the Department of Comparative Lit-erature, including Introduction toComparative Literature and onejunior seminar when available.These four courses must be taughtby a faculty member of the Depart-ment of Comparative Literature;they cannot be cross-listed coursesoriginating in another department. (2) Four courses in a related cul- tural field or discipline. Fields couldinclude history, art history, religion,philosophy, classics, politics, cinemastudies, and so on. The choice ofthese courses will be made in con-sultation with the adviser to form acoherent intellectual field and adefined objective in the major. (3) Two courses in a foreign liter- ature department in the language ofthat literature, normally at the 100level or above. MINOR Four courses originating in theDepartment of Comparative Litera-ture (i.e., not cross-listed courses orig-inating in other departments), includ-ing Introduction to Comparative Lit- erature and a demonstrated readingknowledge of one of the foreign litera-tures studied in these courses. ADVISEMENT The director of undergraduate stud-ies serves as adviser to all compara-tive literature majors and minors. HONORS GRADUATION To receive honors in the major, a student must maintain at least a 3.5average in the 10 courses requiredfor the major and must write asenior honors thesis in his or herfinal semester. A student may dothis either by a) taking the SeniorSeminar course, V29.0400, or by b)working independently after initialadvisement for the thesis is providedby the director of undergraduatestudies, who must be consulted oneterm before that final semester. Thesenior honors thesis is then writtenunder the supervision of a facultymember of the Department of Com-parative Literature whose area of aca-demic expertise coincides with thefocus of the essay. The senior honorsthesis is in addition to the fourcourses originating in the Depart-ment of Comparative Literature andthe other six courses of the major.

Computer science is an academic discipline rooted in mathematics as well as a prac- tical art underlying innovation in business, science, economics, graphic design,communications, government, and education. The value of a computer science degree in a liberal arts program is consistently growing due to demand for graduates withboth general knowledge and specialized skills. The department offers a computer science major, a computer science minor, and a minor in computer applications. The goal of the major is to train students in fundamentalprinciples of computer science as well as many practical aspects of software development. Thegoal of the minors is to train students to be proficient users of computers and computer soft-ware with less emphasis on mathematical tools. Courses combine practical programmingexperience with techniques for analyzing problems and designing computer algorithms. Advanced undergraduate students can work on a variety of research projects with the faculty. Outstanding undergraduates may pursue a master's degree through an acceler-ated five-year program.DEPARTMENT OF Computer Science (22) 251 MERCER STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10012-1185. 212-998-3010.

The focus of the program is primarily on language and literature and the way in which these four civilizations have interacted with the Western world to reconstitute received cultures into modern societies. By intensive study of Asian culture, thestudent is encouraged to reflect on the global interrelatedness of human society. At present,three language sequences are offered: a six-semester Chinese language sequence, a six-semes-ter Japanese language sequence, and a six-semester Korean language sequence. Fourth-year study is also offered in all three languages. In addition, various cours- es in Asian culture in history, politics, literature and art are offered in the Department ofEast Asian Studies and in conjunction with other departments. Since 2000, the departmenthas run the NYU in Nanjing summer program. The proximity of Chinatown to the College of Arts and Science gives students access to many cultural events; important collections and exhibitions of Asian art in NewYork City are always available to the interested student.DEPARTMENT OF East Asian Studies (33) 715 BROADWAY , 3RD FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6806. 212-998-7620. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Harootunian DIRECTOR OF STUDIES: Associate Professor Harootunian, Roberts Associate (History), Yoshimoto, X.Zhang Zhang Studies), Zito (Anthropology, Reli-gious Studies)Senior Language Lecturers: He, Lecturers: Cakmak, Hanawa, Ikeda, Jiao, Kim,Shao, Wang Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES The program has two objectives: (1) to develop a high level of compe-tence in Chinese, Japanese, or Kore-an and (2) to introduce students toAsian cultures through the study oftranslated literary and cultural docu-ments (primarily literature, history,religion, and philosophy) createdwithin those societies. Ongoingstudy of those cultures is encouragedas a means of acquiring a broad com-parative perspective. The courses areoffered in conjunction with variousdepartments, underscoring the mul- tidisciplinary nature of the program. MAJOR The program leads to an East Asianstudies humanities major (32 cred-its) in one of three ways: (1) Stu-dents must complete Chinese,Japanese, or Korean through theadvanced II level, in addition to fourapproved courses from among theEast Asian studies offerings. Ele-mentary levels I and II of these threelanguages will not be countedtoward fulfilling the major require-ment. (2) Students who have already completed the CAS languagerequirement (two years) with eitherChinese, Japanese, or Korean,through a language placement testor accredited course work, arerequired to complete language studythrough the third year (advancedlevel II) and may take six nonlan-guage courses related to the geo-graphic region as defined above.Credit is not given for CAS lan-guage fulfillment or for placementtest results. (3) Students may take32 credits of nonlanguage EastAsian studies courses.66 EAST ASIAN STUDIESAlthough the major of language combined with nonlanguage instruc-tion is strongly recommended, a stu-dent's program can be individuallydesigned in consultation with thedirector of undergraduate studies.Exceptions are only granted at thediscretion of the director of under-graduate studies. Notes: (1) All East Asian studies majors\u2014as well as students plan-ning to major in this field\u2014arerequired to complete one of the fol-lowing courses in fulfillment ofMAP World Culture requirements: V55.0506 Chinese and Japanese Traditions V55.0507 Cultures: China V55.0535 World Korea(2) Asian/Pacific/American studies offers several courses, two of whichcan be used toward the completionof an East Asian studies major.These cross-listings are determinedon a semester-by-semester basis. (3)A limited number of credits aretransferable (normally, no more than16). (4) Cantonese and Tibetan lan-guages may not be counted towardeither major or minor requirements. MINOR The program leads to an East AsianStudies humanities minor (16 cred-its) in one of two ways: (1) Fournonlanguage courses in East Asianstudies alone. (2) A language minorcan be obtained by taking Chinese,Japanese, or Korean up throughAdvanced II level. A student's minor program can sometimes be determined individu-ally in consultation with the directorof undergraduate studies. Transfercredits are normally not accepted.HONORS PROGRAM Eligibility: Students must spend at least two full years in residence atthe College of Arts and Science,completing at least 60 points ofgraded work in the College. Stu-dents must maintain a general gradepoint average of 3.5 and a majoraverage of 3.7. Requirements: (1) Completion of the major requirements. (2) Under the supervi-sion of a departmental faculty mem-ber, an honors paper written as partof Independent Study, V33.0997and V33.0998, for 4 points in total(2 points during each semester) inthe student's senior year. The facultysupervisor and the subject of thehonors paper are chosen in consulta-tion with the director of undergrad-uate studies. The average length ofthe paper is between 25 and 30 dou-ble-spaced, typed pages. For generalrequirements, please see Honors and Awards.

A major or minor in eco-nomics is also useful as a background for careers in law, health, international affairs, business management, public administration, journalism, and politics. Despite the fact that the department is large, student-faculty rapport is excellent, with advanced and honors students working individually with professors. The economics faculty is involved in active research, using the University's excel- lent computer facilities and libraries. Many faculty members are associated with researchinstitutes. The C. V . Starr Center for Applied Economics, directed by Professor JonathanEaton, bridges the gap between academic research and decision making in business and gov-ernment. It analyzes issues with important economic and social consequence and dissemi-nates the results of its research to the business community through a series of conferences,monographs, seminars, and research papers. The Institute for Economic Analysis, directedby Edward Wolff, is an institute that explores theoretical and empirical questions usinginput-output as a primary tool of analysis.DEPARTMENT OF Economics (31) 269 MERCER STREET, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687. 212-998-8900. WWW .ECON.NYU.EDU. CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Paulette Goddard Professor of Political Economy:Benhabib Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Economics:Gertler Jay Gould Professor of Economics: NadiriSilver Professor: Kitsikopoulos Program MAJOR In order to allow students to select anapproach to the study of economicsthat is more suitable to their personalaptitudes and interests, a major in eco-nomics can be taken in either of twoconcentrations as described below. Transfer students should note that normally the only courses thatwill be accepted toward the major ineconomics are courses that have beenpassed with a grade of C or better atuniversities with an intensive four- year program. A grade of C or better is required for a course to count toward themajor in economics. Note: If a stu- dent fails a course required for themajor, the course must be retaken inthe department; a course taken out-side the University will not beallowed to substitute for a failedcourse. No course for the major maybe taken as \"Pass/Fail.\" Policy concentration. The policy concentration is intended for thestudent who is primarily interestedin the application of economic prin-ciples to understanding currentevents, economic institutions, andthe formation of government policy.The introductory and intermediatecourses provide the student with asolid foundation of the basic frame-work for economic analysis with anemphasis on economic applications.The elective courses focus on eco-ECONOMICS 69nomic policy and institutions. This concentration is particularly wellsuited for students planning careersin law, public policy, business, orany other field in which a thoroughunderstanding of economic problemsand the economic way of thinkingwould be beneficial. At least 42 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Department of Economics: V31.0001, V31.0002,V31.0010, V31.0012, V31.0018 (6 points), and five additional 4-pointcourses. Of these five electives, at leasttwo must be numbered V31.0300-399. Students are expected to takeV31.0238 or an approved alternativewith significant international contentas one of their electives. A typical sequence of courses is indicated by sophomore V31.0002, V31.0018;junior year: V31.0010, V31.0012,V31.0238; senior year: four electives. Students are strongly advised to pay close attention to the prerequisitesfor each course. Students should beaware that Precalculus (V63.0009), orits equivalent, is required for the prin-ciples and statistics classes (V31.0001,V31.0002, and V31.0018). Further-more, a course in calculus (V63.0017,V63.0121, or the equivalent) isrequired for the intermediate courses(V31.0010 and V31.0012). Theory concentration. The theory concentration is intended for thestudent who wishes to begin the for-mal study of economic reasoningwith an emphasis on mastering theanalytical tools. This concentrationrelies on a higher level of abstraction and focuses on techniques of eco-nomic analysis rather than on theunderstanding of specific economicproblems or institutions. It is partic-ularly well suited for students whointend to pursue a Ph.D. degree ineconomics or those pursuing careersor higher degrees in quantitativefields such as finance. At least 40 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Department of Eco-nomics that must include V31.0005,V31.0006, V31.0020, V31.0011,V31.0013, V31.0266, and four electives. Two of elec-tives must be courses numberedV31.0300-399 and designated as the-ory classes. Furthermore, studentsmust complete V63.0121, V63.0122,and V63.0123. These calculus coursesshould be completed before or duringthe student's first year in the program. A typical course sequence is sophomore year: V31.0005,V31.0006, Changing concentrations. Stu- dents with permission from thedirector of undergraduate studiesmay change from the policy concen-tration to the theory concentration,or vice versa; however, certain rulesapply. In either case no course maybe taken for which the student doesnot have the appropriate prerequi-sites; this includes the mathematicsprerequisites. Transferring betweenconcentrations after students havecompleted any of the intermediatecourses is very difficult, more so in going from the policy to the theoryconcentration. Students who areunsure about which concentration totake should seek departmentaladvice before beginning their major. MINOR Students may minor in economics ineither concentration. A minor enables astudent to acquire a useful understand-ing of economic concepts and analysiswithout the same degree of coverage aswould be obtained in a major. A grade of C or better is required for a course to count toward theminor in economics. Note: If a stu-dent fails a course required for theminor, the course must be retaken inthe department; a course taken out-side the University will not normal-ly be allowed to substitute for afailed course. No course for theminor may be taken as \"Pass/Fail.\" Policy minor. At least 26 points (6 courses) to be taken in the Department of Economics, includingV31.0001, V31.0002, V31.0018,either V31.0010 or V31.0012, andtwo additional 4-point courses for which the student has the prerequisites. Theory minor. At least 24 points (6 courses) to be taken in theDepartment of Economics to includeV31.0005, V31.0006, V31.0020, atleast one of V31.0011 or V31.0013,and any other two courses for whichthe student has the prerequisites. Joint Major in Economics and Computer Science This is an interdisciplinary major offered by the Department of Com-puter Science with the Departmentof Economics. There are require-ments in three departments, includ-ing mathematics. A grade of C orbetter is required in all courses. The mathematics requirements are V63.0120, V63.0121,V63.0122, and V63.0123. may one of V31.0266,plus any three economics electivecourses, of which mustbe a theory electives numberedV31.0300 to V31.0399. One ofthese electives may be replaced byV22.0444. Joint Major in Economics and MathematicsA joint major is offered by the Departments of Economics andMathematics. In the economicsdepartment, joint majors withmathematics may only take the the-ory sequence. Nine courses must betaken from each department. The mathematics requirements are nine 4-point courses numberedV63.0120 or higher, which must include V63.0325 and V63.0326.The computer science courseV22.0101 may be credited towardthe economics requirements V31.0005, V31.0006, V31.0011,V31.0013, V31.0020, V31.0266,plus any three economics electivecourses, at least two of which must be theory electives numberedV31.0300 to V31.0399. Interested students should con- sult with the director of undergrad-uate studies in both departments foradditional information. 70 ECONOMICSHonors Program Honors may be taken in either con- centration. Students interested ingoing to graduate school or profes-sional schools are strongly urged totake honors. A 3.5 overall grade point average and a 3.5 average in economicscourses are required. Honors stu-dents are required to complete eitherV31.0266 (theory concentration) or V31.0380 (policy concentration).Students are also required to writean honors thesis under faculty super-vision. Students interested in takinghonors register for V31.0410 in thefall semester of the senior year inorder to prepare for V31.0400, to betaken in the spring semester of thatyear. Students are strongly advised to begin the process toward the endof the spring semester of the junioryear. Interested students should con- sult with the director of undergrad-uate studies. For general require-ments, see under Honors and Awards. IncompletesThe Department of Economics expects all students to completetheir courses on time. Incompletesare permitted only under exception-al, well-documented circumstances.Incompletes must be removed bythe end of the semester following the incomplete or they will revertautomatically to a grade of F. Any student who fails to com- plete a course on time will receivean F, not an incomplete, unless theprocedure for incompletes outlined above is followed. A student maypetition for an extension of time toremove the incomplete, but suchrequests will only be granted underthe most unusual circumstances. Courses For a complete list of course descriptions, please visit cas.nyu.edu/page/bulletin.In the list of courses below, some courses are designated either \"P\" or\"T.\" \"P\" represents courses to betaken only by students in the policyconcentration; \"T\" represents coursesto be taken only by students in thetheory concentration. With permis-sion of the director of undergraduatestudies, students may take courses inthe other concentration. Economics course numbers fall into six major groups. Core coursesare numbered below 0100. Coursesnumbered 0100 to 0399 and aboverequire second-year honors arenumbered to 0499. Indepen-dent study credits are numbered0900 to 0999.

The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager fora liberal arts experience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Oncompletion of this five-year program, students receive the Bachelor of Science degree fromthe College of Arts and Science at New York University and the Bachelor of Engineeringdegree from Stevens Institute of Technology. Students with this combination of degrees arelikely to find excellent employment opportunities. The available dual-degree combinations are as follows: engineering; and B.S. in physics/B.E. in mechanical engineering. Detailed programs of study for each of the curricula are available from Mr. Joseph Hemmes and Ms. Aara Kupris Menzi, the advisers for all students in the various programs.They may be contacted at the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington SquareEast, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Application materials for this joint degree program may be requested from New York University, Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 22 Washington Square North, New York, NY 10011-9191.DUAL DEGREE PROGRAM IN Engineering (with Stevens Institute of Technology) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 905, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8130. DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM AT NEW YORKUNIVERSITY: Associate Professor Brenner DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM AT STEVENSINSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: Professor Cole ASSISTANTS TO THE DEAN FOR ENGINEERINGSTUDENTS: Joseph Hemmes and Aara Kupris Menzi 72 ENGINEERINGProgram REQUIREMENTS The dual-degree program is designed to meet the educationaland career interests of students withstrong qualifications, as evidencedby their grade point average in highschool and by their performance inmathematics and science. Studentswho rank near the top of their classand who have done well on stan-dardized tests, particularly in mathe-matics, are especially well suited. Students should have completed a rigorous college preparation program,including mathematics (throughtrigonometry), chemistry, and physics,and exhibited substantial extracurric-ular activity and leadership. Students are usually admitted to the program as freshmen and mustbe prepared to begin with CalculusI, V63.0121, in the first semester ofcollege. Given the highly structuredcurricula, transfer into the programafter the first year is very difficult. Students must maintain satisfactoryperformance and must complete therequired courses in a timely fashionin order to remain in the program.Their records are reviewed yearly bya faculty committee, and studentsare approved by this committee fortransfer to Stevens at the end of thethird year.ENGINEERING 73THE PROGRAM Students accepted into the program spend their first three years of studyin the College of Arts and Science atNew York University. In the firstyear at the College, the differentcurricula call for many of the samecourses. This gives students time toconsult with faculty at both schoolsbefore committing themselves to aparticular science/engineering major.A typical first-year program mightconsist of the following courses: Fall semester: Writing the Essay, V40.0100; a course from theMorse Academic (MAP); Cal-culus EngineeringDesign and ChemistryLaboratory I, V25.0103, or Intro-duction to Computer Science I,V22.0101. Spring semester: A course from the Morse Academic Plan (MAP);Calculus II, V63.0122; EngineeringDesign Laboratory II, V37.0112;Physics for Engineers I, V85.0081;and either General Chemistry II,V25.0102, and General ChemistryLaboratory II, V25.0104, or Intro-duction to Computer Science II,V22.0102. At the end of the first year, if they have not already done so, stu-dents select a major area for theirremaining two years of study atNew York University from the disci-plines of biology, chemistry, com-puter science, mathematics, andphysics. Seminars by Stevens departmen- tal faculty advisers and by profes-sional engineering leaders from pri- vate firms are included in the Soci-ety of Engineering Students' weeklymeetings to provide information tostudents about opportunities in thevarious engineering fields represent-ed. Students should choose theirdesired engineering major by theend of the second year. In the springof the third year, an orientation pro-gram helps students prepare for thetransition to Stevens in the fourthyear. In these first three years of theprogram, students also satisfy theirMAP requirements. In the first year,students are introduced to the engi-neering design experience withEngineering Design Laboratory Iand II. In the second and thirdyears, students are required to takeengineering courses, taught byStevens faculty at the WashingtonSquare campus. These courses are allsubjects in the \"core\" engineeringcurriculum, taken by all engineeringstudents, regardless of engineeringmajor. These courses are at the firstlevel of engineering study and givestudents an opportunity to learn thetechnical feel of various engineeringsubjects. The second-year courses areMechanics of Solids, V37.5126 andGraphics Design and Lab (CAD),V37.5211. The third year coursesare Circuits and Systems, V37.7245,Electronics and Instrumentation,V37.7246, and Engineering DesignLab IV , V37.0232. These introduc-tory courses must be completedprior to entering the fourth year atStevens. These are difficult curricula, and some programs may require summercourses for some students. Stevenshas permitted students in the pro- gram tuition-free enrollment in afew summer courses offered only atStevens (but not at NYU) to assiststudents in maintaining curricularprogress. Students may elect towithdraw from the dual-degree pro-gram in engineering and completeonly the College of Arts and Sciencegeneral and major requirements atNew York University. Financial aidand scholarships, housing, dining,and other services are provided byNew York University during thefirst three years. The final two years of study are undertaken at Stevens Institute ofTechnology at Castle Point in Hobo- ken, New Jersey, directly across theHudson River and a short PATHtrain ride from New York Universi-ty's Greenwich Village campus. At Stevens, students complete the remaining technical courses, themajority of the engineering courses,and the senior design project in thefifth year. Programs in engineeringavailable to students in the NYU-Stevens dual-degree program includechemical engineering, civil engineer-ing, computer engineering, electricalengineering, environmental engi-neering, and mechanical engineering. In the last two years of the pro- gram, financial aid, housing, dining,and other services are provided byStevens at the Castle Point campus.Separate transcripts are supplied bythe two schools, and students maymake use of the facilities of thecareer and placement offices of bothinstitutions.

The study of English and American literature fosters the kind of intellectual training that is central to a liberal arts education and useful in all professions. By learning toread critically and to write with analytical precision, students who major in English prepare themselves to participate intelligently in their culture while forging a lifelong,enriching relationship with literature. The department's offerings are bolstered by the strong literature collections avail- able on campus at the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, which also houses the Fales Library ofEnglish and American Literature. Students are also encouraged to make use of the researchopportunities presented by the excellent collections of the New York Historical Society andthe New York Public Library. The department provides opportunities for specialized research through seminars, independent study courses, and an honors program that culminates in the writing of an hon-ors thesis during the senior year under the supervision of a faculty member. The departmentalso offers elective credit for internships in publishing, at literary agencies, and at other pro-fessional offices. The rich cultural life of New York City, and of Greenwich Village in par-ticular, make NYU an ideal location for the study of English and American literature.DEPARTMENT OF English (41) 19 UNIVERSITY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4556. 212-998-8800.

Both the major and minor are designed for students seeking preprofessional training for careers in international business andfinance, diplomacy, international law, and cultural organizations dealing with Europe.Although open to all students, the minor is especially suited to majors in European lan-guages, history, or the social sciences. The center also offers a full program of colloquia andworkshops dealing with both Western and Eastern Europe, some of which are open toundergraduate majors and minors.CENTER FOR European Studies (42) 58 WEST 10TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-8786. 212-998-3838. DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER: Professor Schain Faculty2003-2005 Max (European Studies), Grib-bin (European Studies), Moazami(European Studies)The following positions are filled every year by visiting faculty:Visiting Consortium Professor and Postdoctoral Fellow of EuropeanUnion Studies Program MAJOR With the help of the European studies adviser, students prepare a prelimi-nary program outline at the time theydeclare their major. Although thereare no formal tracks, courses are nor-mally organized around the interestsof a student in one of two ways: anemphasis on contemporary Europeansocieties\u2014their problems and poli-cies; or an emphasis on contemporaryEuropean cultures\u2014their ideas, val-ues, and artistic and literary trends.The program enables students toorganize their courses around a practi-cal or theoretical problem in contem-porary European society or culturethat is applicable to one or severalcountries. A typical problem mightinclude such subjects as the changingimpact of politics on culture andsocial cleavages; changing patterns ofreligious expression in Europe; liter-ary expression and changing society inEurope; the European approach problems; migration and Europe; Europe; and democratictransition in Europe. The problem,for which the tools of several academicdisciplines should be applicable, willbe the basis for the major researchproject. Majors in European studies must have or attain an advanced levelknowledge of a major European lan-guage other than English (e.g.,French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian,German, Russian). In order to provethis knowledge students must suc-cessfully complete an advance levellanguage course. The alternative tothis is to have passed the CAS profi-ciency exam prior to graduation.Nine courses that deal with Europeare required: two in history (beyondthe introductory level); two in litera-ture (preferably in the language ofspecialization); two in the social sci-ences; two in philosophy, fine arts, orcinema studies; and one senior hon- ors seminar in European studies. Thesenior seminar is interdisciplinaryand includes the requirement of amajor research project (or thesis). Asequence of courses might beginwith two advanced history coursesand two literature courses in thesophomore and/or junior years, fol-lowed by two social science and twophilosophy, fine arts, and/or cinemastudies courses. The interdisciplinaryseminar should be taken during thefirst semester of the senior year. Majors who entered the college in fall 2000 and thereafter are requiredto complete a semester abroad. Stu-dents may petition the director ofthe center for exemption from thisrequirement. Students who fulfill the require- ments of the major with an overallgrade point average of at least 3.5and at least 3.5 in European studieswill receive the B.A. degree with80 EUROPEAN STUDIEShonors in European studies. The honors designation recognizes thework beyond the normal course workrequired of students in the seniorseminar and in the major researchproject. MINOR All students minoring in West Euro-pean studies must demonstrate profi-ciency in at least one West Europeanlanguage above the intermediate level(French, German, Italian, Portuguese,or Spanish). They must also fulfill thefollowing course requirements: onecourse in modern European history;one course in European politics,anthropology, or economics(V53.0150, V14.0111, or V31.0224);and three additional courses Spanish civilization. Nomore than two of these courses mayfocus on any one specific country. Allcourse programs must be designed inconsultation with the center's under-graduate program adviser. B.A./M.A. PROGRAM This new program offers qualifyingmajors in European studies theopportunity to earn both the B.A.and the M.A. degrees in a shorterperiod of time and at reduced tuitioncost. By taking some of their gradu-ate requirements while still under-graduates, students can complete theprogram in a maximum of five years.In the graduate portion of the pro-gram, students receive a fellowshipthat covers up to half of the tuitionfor the courses required for the M.A. European studies majors may apply for admission to the programafter they have completed at least 32points in the College and threecourses toward the major. Applica-tions are reviewed by the GraduateAdmission Committee of the Centerfor European Studies, using the nor-mal criteria for the M.A. program,except that applicants are notrequired to take the GREs. The com-mittee bases its decision on students'undergraduate records and recom-mendations of NYU instructors. A working knowledge at an advanced level of a European language(other than English) is required tocomplete the program, and knowl-edge of a second European language isencouraged. Students must spend atleast one semester in an approved aca-demic program in Europe, normallyduring their junior year. Students arealso required to write a senior honorsthesis and master's thesis (see below)to earn the two degrees. The program requires a total of 19 courses: nine undergraduate cours-es and 10 graduate courses. For thefirst four years, students focus theirwork on a \"problem area\" that willeventually become the subject master's thesis. The seniorhonor's thesis is an integrative projectwithin the problem area developedby the student and his or her adviser.It may be an expansion of a researchpaper written for an undergraduatecourse. The graduate portion of thedegree comprises three tracks\u2014Poli-tics and Society, European UnionStudies, and Humanities and Cultur-al Trends\u2014and students must chooseone of these by the beginning of theirfifth year. Of the 10 graduate courses,two are required (one a graduateintroductory history course, the othera graduate research seminar in Euro-pean studies), and two others must bechosen from the graduate program'score courses, depending on which ofthe three tracks the student choosesfor specialization. Students are alsorequired to take five additional grad-uate courses in their chosen track. Aninternship, arranged and approved bythe center, is recommended as thefinal course. With prior approval, astudent may take a graduate seminarin lieu of an internship. Each student's program is orga- nized with his or her adviser at thetime that he or she enters the pro-gram. The first draft of the thesis isdeveloped in the undergraduate Semi-nar on European Studies (V42.0300),taken in the fall semester of the fourthyear. The master's thesis is a revisionof this project and is further devel-oped in the graduate Research Semi-nar (G42.3000), taken in the fallsemester of the fifth year. The M.A.thesis must be defended at an oralexamination during the spring semes-ter of the fifth year.

EUROSIM EUROSIM is an annual model Euro-pean Union simulation designed toenhance students' classroom knowl-edge of the workings of a politicallyand economically integrated Europe.The simulation exercise models thelegislative procedure of the Euro-pean Union from the introduction ofa draft resolution by the EuropeanCommission to the acceptance (orrejection) of an amended documentby the European Council. Each year, New York State col- leges and universities send a delega-tion of undergraduate students toEUROSIM to represent one of themember states of the European Unionand the European Commission. Thelegislation on which delegates work isfocused on one main theme chosen forits relevance to current Europeanissues. Students individually play theroles of real-life government minis-ters, members of the European Parlia-ment, and members of the Economicand Social Committee and the Com-mittee of the Regions. EUROSIM is held in alternating years in the United States and inEurope. In addition, several Euro-pean universities send students to bepart of their respective member statedelegations alongside the Americanstudents. In this way, U.S. studentsreceive a \"home-grown\" perspectiveof the issues that they are debating.

Students at the introductory level examine art objectsand learn the basic critical and historical vocabulary through which these objects may be understood and appreciated. At the advanced level, majors and nonmajors alike havethe opportunity to investigate aspects (e.g., style, iconography, patronage, and social andpolitical context) of the arts in a particular geographical area at a given historical time. Thisadvanced work, in conjunction with appropriate language training, provides a solid foun-dation for those who plan to go to graduate school in preparation for a career in the arts (e.g.,scholarship, teaching, museums, writing). The urban design and architecture studies program offers an interdisciplinary ana- lytic approach to urban design and architecture. The program provides both a broad,humanistic perspective on the physical aspects of the city and preprofessional training forfuture architects, city planners, public administrators, and writers on urban problems. An internationally renowned faculty and a diverse group of students share the Grey Art Library and Study Center, which includes lecture and seminar rooms, offices, a referencelibrary, and ample space for the study of visual materials.DEPARTMENT OF Fine Arts (43) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 303, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8180.

This minor isalso of practical value for fine arts orurban design studies majors plan-ning careers in museology, conserva-tion, architecture, city planning, andlandmarks preservation. The minor consists of six 3-point courses, to be chosen from coursesoffered by the Steinhardt School ofEducation. Required courses (12 points) include Introduction to Drawing,Introduction to Sculpture, Introduc-tion to Painting, and Introduction toPhotography I; Electives (6 points) include any E90.000- or E90.1000-level course within the Departmentof Art and Art Professions.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES Under special circumstances, stu- dents are allowed to enroll for cours-es in the Graduate School of Artsand Science and in the Robert F.Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. If these courses are creditedtoward the undergraduate degree, noadvanced credit is allowed toward agraduate degree.FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE 89The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the Morse Academic Plan seeks to provide students with the perspective and intellectual methods tocomprehend the development of our human cultures. The four FCC courses introduce students to the modes of inquiry by which societies may be studied, socialissues analyzed, and artistic activity explored. Together they give undergraduates a broadmethodological background on which to draw when later engaged in the more focusedwork of their major courses of study. As a result, students receive a richer education thanany single major could provide. Through this core experience in humanistic and social-scientific inquiry and its focus on a number of similar readings across different course sections, the FCC framework allowsstudents to enter into dialogue with one another despite differences in their course schedulesand in this way also encourages lifelong habits of intellectual curiosity and engagement. As they learn the sound employment of the academic approaches at the center of their FCC classes, students develop their abilities to read critically, think rigorously, and writeeffectively. By building these skills and an appreciation of the diversity of human experience,the FCC seeks to prepare students for their continued learning in and beyond college, foractive participation in their communities, and for lives in a rapidly changing world. All FCC courses are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished professors. In addition to two lectures a week, every FCC course includes recita-tion sections led by graduate student preceptors, allowing for small-group discussion of thereadings, close attention to students' written work, and personal concern for students' progress.Foundations of Contemporary Culture (55) 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 903, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8119.

Even more than their forebears, citizens of the 21st century will need competence andconfidence in dealing with the approaches and findings of science if they are to makeinformed decisions on vital political, economic, and social issues. Rather than striving forencyclopedic coverage of facts, Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) courses stress theprocess of scientific reasoning and seek to illustrate the role of science and mathematics in ourunderstanding of the natural world. The objectives of the FSI sequence are to give studentswho will not be science majors a positive experience in scientific inquiry and to encouragelearning about how science is done. The quantitative component of these courses emphasizesthe critical role of mathematics in the analysis of natural phenomena. The courses within theFSI are collected into three groups\u2014Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Science I, and Natur-al Science II. All lectures are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University'smost distinguished professors, and each course includes workshops or related laboratory sec-tions led by graduate student preceptors.Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (55) 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687. 212-998-8119.

HONORS PROGRAM IN FRENCH STUDIES Eligibility: A student must spend a minimum of three full semesters inresidence at the College of Arts andScience. Attendance at New YorkUniversity in Paris counts towardsuch residence. The student mustmaintain a general grade point aver-age of at least 3.5 and a major aver-age of 3.5 or higher.Requirements: (1) Completion of the major requirements. (2) An honors paper. The student should plan to take 4 points of Inde-pendent Study, V45.0997 orV45.0998, under the direction ofthe department faculty memberwith whom the student wishes to dohonors work. The choice of the fac-ulty member and the subject of thepaper are worked out in consultationwith the faculty member and thedirector of undergraduate studies.The honors paper is a work of schol-arship and/or criticism in a field ofFrench studies. On the average, itshould be from 25 to 50 double-spaced typed pages. Usually, thepaper and the course in independentstudy are done at the start of thesenior year. (3) An oral examination at the end of the senior year based on theFRENCH 95honors paper. For general require- ments, please see under Honors and Awards. INTERNSHIPS In addition to the basic require- ments for the major, students alsohave the opportunity to participatein internships sponsored by theDepartment of French. Recentinternships have been completed atthe French cultural services office,the French music office, and theFrench film office. ACCELERATED B.A./M.A. PROGRAM IN FRENCHSTUDIES The Department of French and the Institute of French Studies offerqualified students the opportunityto earn the B.A. and M.A. degreesin a shortened period of study.While still undergraduates, studentsenrolled in the program may earn upto 8 points toward the M.A. bycompleting two graduate courses inthe Department of French or at theInstitute of French Studies. In orderto earn advanced standing, thesepoints may not be counted towardan undergraduate degree but mustbe in excess of the 128 pointsrequired for the B.A. Under normal circumstances, this can be achieved by studentswho register for the maximumallowable number of points in theirsenior year. Earned in this manner, advanced standing has the additionaladvantage of enabling qualified stu-dents to start graduate work notonly at an earlier stage but also inthe most cost-efficient way. Students majoring in French lan- guage and literature (Program 1)may apply credits thus earnedtoward the M.A. in French litera-ture, which can be completed in theDepartment of French. Studentsmajoring in French language, soci-ety, and culture (Program 2) mayapply the credits toward the M.A. inFrench civilization to be completedat the Institute of French Studies.Students who plan to enroll at thelatter are expected to earn advancedstanding by selecting from amongseveral core courses taught at theinstitute. Admission to the program is open to students who have complet-ed 90 points with a grade pointaverage of at least 3.5 and with acumulative grade point average inthe major of 3.5 or higher. Applica-tion to the program can be madethrough the director of undergradu-ate studies in French, 19 UniversityPlace, 6th floor. Final acceptanceinto the graduate sequence of theprogram is contingent on successfulcompletion of the B.A., formaladmission into the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science, and approval bythe director of graduate studies or,in the case of students seeking theM.A. in French civilization, the director of the Institute of FrenchStudies. FACILITIES The University has two special facil- ities for students of French. La Maison Fran\u00e7aise: This attractive house in the old and pic-turesque Washington Mews is opento students of French. It has a com-fortable lounge, a small readingroom opening onto a terrace, and asoundproof music room. Programsof lectures and recreational activitiesfree to all students interested inFrench are given here. Institute of French Studies: Adjacent to La Maison Fran\u00e7aise inWashington Mews, the institute offers graduate courses in contempo-rary French society and culture thatare open to undergraduates withspecial permission. The institute hasa large newspaper and periodical col-lection and a wide range of video-tapes; it also organizes frequent lec-tures and seminars by visiting schol-ars, political personalities, and busi-ness and administrative leaders fromFrance.

These seminars aim to introduce students, at the beginning of their college careers, to demanding and challenging standards of analysis and argumentation, oral as well as writ-ten. They do so by means of intensive discussion, papers on focused topics, and reading thatemphasizes critical interpretation rather than absorption of information. Except wherenoted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student's part.Enrollment is usually limited to 16 students. As a rule, the seminars are given only in the fall semester. The array of seminars changes from year to year. A brochure describing all the fall offerings and their instructorsappears in late spring. Below is a sampling of Freshman Honors Seminars that have beentaught more than once in recent years.PROGRAM IN Freshman Honors Seminars (50) 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 908, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8110.

At itscore, the program encourages students to question the meanings of \"male\" and \"female,\" Western and non-Western societies. Courses seek to unravel the ways gender and sex-uality come into being and shape social roles and identities, as well as the ways in whichother social and cultural divisions such as race, class, and ethnicity function in the experi-ence of gender and sexuality. The Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies challenges theprivileging of some categories (e.g., male or heterosexual) over others, and analyzes the socialand political implications of such hierarchies. The curriculum makes gender and sexualitycentral rather than peripheral terms of analysis and seeks to complicate what is presented as\"natural\" or \"normal\" in traditional academic curricula.PROGRAM IN Gender and Sexuality Studies (97) CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF GENDER AND SEXUALITY , 285 MERCER STREET, 3RD FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6653. 212-992-9541. DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Professor Dinshaw DIRECTOR OF UNDER-GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Haney 100 GENDER AND SEXUALITY STUDIESFacultyProfessors: Apter (French), Dinshaw (English),Feldman (Hebrew and Judaic Stud-ies), Gilligan(School of Law), Ginsburg (Anthro-pology), Green-berg (Sociology), Harper (English), (Tisch School of Arts),Stacey (History),Mu\u00f1oz (Performance Studies), (History), McHenry(English), Rust (English), Vincent(Comparative Literature) Programs MAJOR A student who majors in gender andsexuality studies must also choose aconcentration in any other depart-ment within the College of Arts andScience. Students with doublemajors may waive this requirement. The gender and sexuality studies major typically requires 48 points(12 courses). The major requires 32points in gender and sexuality stud-ies and 16 points in the student'sdepartmental concentration. Because8 of these points may overlap(V97.0021, for instance, may counttoward both the gender and sexuali- ty studies major and a concentrationin Sociology), some students willcomplete the major with 40 points. All majors must complete at least one of the two introductory-levelcourses, Introduction to Gender andSexuality Studies (V97.0010) orStudying Gender, Studying Sexuality(V97.0011), and Senior Seminar(V97.0999). Because of the interdis-ciplinary nature of scholarship in thesubject, remaining gender and sexu-ality studies electives must be drawnfrom at least three different depart-ments or areas that are not the disci-pline of the student's departmental concentration. Individual programs must be approved by the director of under-graduate studies. MINOR A gender and sexuality studiesminor requires 16 points (fourcourses) drawn from at least two dif-ferent departments or areas. Minorsmust complete Introduction to Gen-der and Sexuality Studies(V97.0010) or Studying Gender,Studying Sexuality (V97.0011). GENDER AND SEXUALITY STUDIES 101HONORS Students who wish to pursue honors work must have and maintain a gradepoint average of at least 3.5 bothoverall and in their major. Honorswork in gender and sexuality studiesconsists of the completion of one semester of research work and onesemester of thesis writing, rigorouslyadhering to the guidelines set out bythe program (guidelines are availablein Program in Gender and SexualityStudies office). All honors students offer a presentation describing andanalyzing their experiences to facultyand students in the program.

Students may chooseamong three majors: German language and literature; German studies; and German and linguistics. Minor programs are available in German language and in German literaturein translation. Along with its German language programs, the department offers interdisciplinary courses taught in English, which address issues of German culture, history, philosophy, sci-ence, art, and literature for students who do not have German language skills. An extensiveprogram of individualized study, with flexible credit and meeting options, allows studentsto work one-on-one with faculty members to pursue topics of individual interest. The department sponsors the activities of the German Club and of the Tau Chap- ter of Delta Phi Alpha, the national German honor society, as well as a series of annualawards in recognition of outstanding achievement by undergraduate students in the studyof German language and literature. Deutsches Haus, the German cultural center at NYU,provides a varied program of films, concerts, lectures, and exhibitions. The Department of German places high priority on fostering personal contact between faculty and students, maintains relatively small class sizes (15 or fewer students onaverage), and offers comfortable spaces for socializing, studying, and holding informal meet-ings. Advanced courses and some basic language courses are taught by full-time facultymembers, all of whom are also involved in student advising.DEPARTMENT OF German (51) 19 UNIVERSITY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4556. 212-998-8650.

Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies provides students with a com- prehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of the language, literature, history,and politics of Greece. Through a wide range of courses, students are exposed to a polyphony of viewpoints that help elucidate the historical and political experiences ofByzantine, Ottoman, and modern Greece; the ways in which Greece has borne its severalpasts and translated them into the modern era; Greece and its relations to Western Europe,the Balkans, the Middle East, and Mediterranean cultures; and the distinguished literaryand artistic traditions of a country that many regard as the birthplace of Western civiliza-tion, even as these traditions exhibit their multicultural contexts. NYU's summer program in Athens combines classroom study of the language, his- tory, and culture of Greece with extracurricular activities and excursions that introduce stu-dents to all aspects of Greek life. The program offers a wide range of courses, includingancient and modern Greek language, Greek Drama, Modern Greek Politics, the City ofAthens, and the Archaeology of Greece. Classes are held at the Al Andar Center, a three-storyBauhaus building located in the historical center of Athens. Activities include walking toursof Athens, visits to monuments and museums, and evening outings to dramatic and musicalperformances; weekend excursions include trips to several Greek islands, medieval settle-ments, and other important historical and archaeological sites.

A solidfoundation in the modern Greeklanguage is a prerequisite for allmajors. Upon declaring the major, astudent will be expected to enroll inElementary Modern Greek I(V56.0103) or take a placementexamination in the modern Greeklanguage. By the end of their pro-gram, all students must demonstrate competence in Modern Greek at theintermediate level through success-ful completion of two semesters ofintermediate Modern Greek(V56.0105 and V56.0106) or aplacement examination. Programs of Study: Qualified students may choose from three pro-posed areas of concentration: (1) Track A: Language, Literature, and Culture provides students with a solid foundation in the modernGreek language and provides a com-prehensive introduction to medieval and modern Greek literature andculture. (2) Track B: Politics and History provides students with an interdisci-plinary social science perspective onthe medieval and modern Greekexperience. Students may choose toconcentrate their studies in historyor politics or create their own com-bination in consultation with thedirector of undergraduate studies. (3) Track C: The Classical Legacy provides students with an interdisci-112 HELLENIC STUDIESplinary perspective on the reception of classical Greek thought in post-classical Greece. Students in tracks A and B who have placed out of IntermediateModern Greek are encouraged totake two semesters of AdvancedModern Greek: Literature and Civi-lization I and II (V56.0107 andV56.0108). Track C students whoplace out of Intermediate ModernGreek are encouraged to take twosemesters of Ancient Greek.

History is the study of human experience of all kinds, considered in relation to par- ticular times and places. It is also a method of thinking characterized by its atten-tion to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. By mastering this method of thinking, students of history gain invaluable skills and techniques. They learn toanalyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural, social, economic, andpolitical\u2014to organize it into a coherent whole and present it clearly with style in writtenor oral form. In doing so, students also learn to justify and to question their own and oth-ers' conclusions, for history is always an argument about what actually happened. Indeed,rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions is one of the most important\u2014andmost interesting\u2014tasks of the historian. Notable among the department's areas of scholarly strength are American urban, social, labor, and ethnic history; medieval, early modern, and modern European history; andAmerican and European women's history. The sub-Saharan African, Latin American, and Asianareas are also strong and tend to be multidisciplinary. Through independent study and thehonors program, students find challenging opportunities for special concentration and indi-vidual research. The internship program enables students to engage in special kinds of super-vised historical projects for credit. Many of the projects are at cultural institutions in New Yorkand at the United Nations. The University's Elmer Holmes Bobst Library is rich in works of history, and stu- dents also may also use the collections of the New York Public Library, the historical soci-eties and museums in New York City, and neighboring universities.DEPARTMENT OF History (57) 53 WASHINGTON SQUARE SOUTH, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10012-1098. 212-998-8600.

The study of Italianliterature and culture permits an investigation of this heritage. Yet Italy is not defined only by its past. One of the most advanced and prosperous countries in the world, Italy haslong provided models of family-based capitalism (Benetton, Fiat) and is a leader in fashionand design. Its economic productivity and importance in geopolitical and trade networksbrings immigrants from Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia to the country. An education inItalian language, culture, and society offers a basis for understanding present-day Italy andits impact on globalized workforces and marketplaces. Italian studies has application forcareers in international business, diplomacy, design, and the fine arts. As part of a doublemajor, Italian is an excellent complement to studies in other areas including economics,political science, law, history, comparative literature, music, art, drama, and film. The Department of Italian Studies at New York University is one of the country's leading centers for Italian studies and offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Afaculty of internationally renowned scholars is supplemented by the regular presence ofprominent visiting professors from Italy.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES Qualified undergraduates may regis- ter for graduate courses in Italianwith the permission of the directorof graduate studies. A complete listof appropriate graduate courses isavailable in the department eachsemester.At New York University, we believe that journalism has a serious public mission and can make a difference. We want to educate those who agree. Opportunities aboundin the media world, but the opportunity to do compelling work that informs, engages\u2014and matters\u2014is what drives our faculty, motivates our students, and informs ourentire approach. Great journalism has always come from the great cities of the globe, andthere is no better place to learn the craft than the city of New York\u2014where power andwealth concentrate, news and culture originate, and daily events fascinate. Centrally located in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, the department immerses stu- dents in the richness and vitality of the city, while attracting to campus many of the lead-ers and thinkers in the journalism profession. New York City is our laboratory\u2014and ourinspiration. The very first lesson we offer students is this: Tap into it, with our help. NYUstudents study as interns in almost every major news organization in the city. They oftengraduate to jobs in newspapers, magazines, broadcast outlets, and online operations head-quartered in New York, though some choose to go elsewhere. And every day, students moveoutward from the classroom to the city, on assignments that take them all over town. The full-time faculty is itself of national stature in the journalism world. As writ- ers, reporters, producers, and critics, NYU professors continue to practice the journalismthey teach and preach, holding the profession to its highest standards of public service.Course work begins with the basic skills of reporting, writing, and research, but simulta-neously students are taught what journalism at its best can be\u2014and what it should accom-plish in a free and democratic society. They are also encouraged to publish their work, withassignments, internships, and online projects geared to this end. Housed within the arts and sciences core of a leading university, the department sees journalism as an essential strand in the liberal arts tradition and a critical factor in pub-lic culture. But we also recognize that news these days is a business. When our skilled grad-uates enter that business, they are prepared to improve and enliven it. Department facilities include four state-of-the-art newsrooms, modern broadcast production facilities, the Associated Press wire service, and desktop publishing.

The law and society minoroffers undergraduates a meaningful cluster of these courses. The requirement of five courses allows this interdisciplinary minor to be substantial, and the inclusion of a corecourse enhances its coherence. In addition, the minor gives capable and ambitious studentsattractive opportunities to pursue advanced or specialized study. While prelaw students maywell wish to take it, this minor is not aimed specifically at them. Professor Lewis Kornhauser and Professor Jo Dixon, in consultation with a faculty committee, oversee the minor in law and society.INSTITUTE FOR Law and Society (62) Minor 161 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, 12TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10013. 212-998-8536.

It seeks to determine that which is nec- essary in human language, that which is possible, and that which is impossible.While linguists work to determine the unique qualities of individual languages, they are constantly searching for linguistic universals, for properties whose explanatory powerreaches across languages. The discipline of linguistics is organized around syntax (the prin-ciples by which sentences are organized), morphology (the principles by which words areconstructed), semantics (the study of meaning), phonetics (the study of speech sounds),phonology (the sound patterns of language), historical linguistics (the ways in which lan-guages change over time), sociolinguistics (the interaction of language with society), psy-cholinguistics, and neurolinguistics (the representation of language in the brain). Currentresearch by faculty members extends across the field: it includes topics in the interaction ofsyntax and semantics, phonetics and phonology, languages in contact, pidgin and creole lan-guages, urban sociolinguistics, and computer analogies of syntactic processes.DEPARTMENT OF Linguistics (61) 719 BROADWAY , 4TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6860. 212-998-7950.

Any course substi-tution or transfer credit toward arequired course for the major mustbe confirmed by a letter from thedirector of undergraduate studies. HONORS PROGRAM A major or joint major who wishesto graduate with honors must have a3.5 overall GPA and an average of3.5 in linguistics courses. Studentswishing to participate in the honorsprogram will work with the directorof undergraduate studies, beginningin the student's junior year, to mapan advanced course of study, onethat will culminate in an honorsthesis. The course of study willentail extra work in two or more rel-evant undergraduate linguisticscourses or will instead entail com-pletion of at least two relevant grad-uate courses within the department(or a combination of these twostrategies). In the course of doingthis additional work, the studentwill construct a thesis proposal andselect an adviser with whom towork. The student will then com-plete the thesis while enrolled in anindependent study course with thethesis adviser, ordinarily in the stu-dent's final semester prior to gradua-tion.

Numerical Methods G63.2010, 2020 G63.2911, 2912142 MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIESThe undergraduate Program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies is part of the Medieval and Renaissance Center (MARC). It focuses on the history, institutions, lan-guages, literatures, thought, faith, art, and music of Europe and the Mediterranean world from the collapse of Roman authority to about 1600 C.E. It is during this importantperiod\u2014which shaped and transmitted the classical heritage\u2014that the social, artistic, intel-lectual, and scientific culture of present-day Europe and the Middle East was formed. The curriculum in medieval and Renaissance studies links undergraduates with NYU's outstanding humanities faculty, with the superb libraries, museums, and collectionsin the New York area, and with musical and theatrical performances of works from this peri-od that are given regularly in the city. It also enriches students' intellectual and artistic expe-rience in CAS programs abroad. Students design their own programs in consultation withthe program director and faculty: they thus experience the intimate guidance of a center ofexcellence within the parameters of a great university.PROGRAM IN Medieval and Renaissance Studies (65) THE MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE CENTER, 726 BROADWAY , ROOM 628, NEW YORK, NY 10003-9580. 212-998-8698. DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM: Professor Claster Raymo Sandler (Fine Arts) Alexander (Fine Arts), (Classics), Boorman Studies), Javitch(Comparative Literature), Krinsky(Fine Arts), Kupperman (History), Low (English), Martinez (Spanish andPortuguese), Matthews (Fine Arts),Mitsis (Classics), Oliva (History),Peters (Middle Eastern Rubenstein (Hebrew andJudaic Studies), Vitz(French), (Hebrew and Judaic Studies) Associate Professors: Crabtree (Anthropology), DopicoBlack (Spanish and Portuguese),Erspamer Hoover (Eng-lish), (Middle Eastern andIslamic Studies), Krabbenhoft (Span-ish and Portuguese), Marincola (Classics), Momma (English), Rice(Fine Arts), Ross (Spanish and Por-tuguese), Rowson (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies), Zezula (French) Assistant Professors: Ardizzone (Italian), Flood (FineArts), Geronimus (Fine Arts),Husain (Middle Eastern and IslamicStudies), Katz (Middle Eastern andIslamic Studies), Rust (English),Smith (Fine Arts) Adjunct Professors: Peter Kardon (Guggenheim Insti-tute), Michael Stoller (Bobst Library) Program OBJECTIVES The program offers an interdiscipli-nary approach to the civilization andculture of the Middle Ages and theRenaissance. It is specificallydesigned for students wishing towork in more than one field of spe-cialization and to develop majorsaround their own interests ratherthan those of a departmental major.Individual advisement enables stu- dents to develop a coherent course ofstudy that suits their needs andinterests. The fields of specializationfrom which students may draw todevelop their programs currentlyinclude (1) language and literature:classics, comparative literature, Eng-lish, French, Italian, Middle Eastern(Arabic), Hebrew and Judaic, andSpanish and (2) fine arts; (3) history; (4) music; and (5)philosophy and religion. Available to majors and minors is the Marco Polo Travel Award,which is granted to an outstandingstudent each year to allow her orhim to travel abroad for research. Majors in this program have gone on to graduate work inMEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES 143medieval studies, Celtic studies, archival studies, religious studies,history, art history, and English, aswell as to professional schools. Othermajors have gone on to careers inbusiness and in education. MAJOR Ten courses in medieval and Renais- sance studies, of which at least fivemust be in a single field of concen-tration; four or, preferably, threecourses in one or more other fields ofconcentration; and one or, preferably,two courses in an interdisciplinaryseminar. In addition, students areexpected to show proficiencythrough course work or examinationin Latin (or another language centralto their area, such as ancient Greek,Arabic, or Hebrew) and in one otherlanguage appropriate to the field ofconcentration. MINOR Five courses, of which at least twomust be in a single field of concen-tration, one in each of two otherfields of concentration, and an inter-disciplinary seminar. PROGRAM APPROVAL AND ADVISEMENT The director is happy to discuss with students their general educa-tional and career aims as well as the specific opportunities provided bythe Program in Medieval andRenaissance Studies. All major andminor programs require the approvalof the director of the program. HONORS PROGRAM The general requirements for depart-mental honors are outlined in theHonors and Awards section of this bulletin. In addition, students wish-ing to receive their degree with hon-ors in medieval and Renaissancestudies are required to complete asatisfactory thesis on a topic of theirchoice demonstrating their ability tocontrol the relevant sources, bibliog-raphy, and methodology. Students who meet the general College requirements must seek writ-ten approval of the director of theprogram before beginning the seniorthesis\u2014an essay of 30 to 60 pages ona research topic\u2014at which time athesis director will be chosen. Oncethe topic has been defined, the stu-dent will meet with the thesis direc-tor to discuss bibliography andresearch plans. Students will normal-ly take one independent study duringthe course of the research and writingof the thesis. The independent studycourse will be supervised by the the-sis director and may not replace anyof the primary or secondary concen-tration requirements for the major. Deadlines for completing the honorsthesis are the following: the thesisoutline and bibliography are due onemonth after the opening date of theterm; the completed first draft is duetwo months after the opening of theterm; the completed final draft is duethree weeks before the end of theterm. This schedule enables studentsto compete for awards, honors, andfellowships. STUDY ABROAD MARC prepares and encourages itsstudents to complement their workin medieval and Renaissance studiesat one of NYU's Study Abroad pro-grams in Florence, London, Madrid,Paris, and Prague or at one of theWestern European exchange univer- sities.

Using New York City astheir laboratory, students work to understand the relationship between people and the built environment. In their course work, students develop a critical understanding ofhow metropolitan areas evolve while examining those areas' core problems. The program exploits one of NYU's major assets\u2014its New York City location\u2014in a variety of ways. Students learn through assignments involving independent fieldwork,observation, and analysis in both Manhattan and the greater metropolitan area. All majorsparticipate in an internship program enabling them to work in government or nonprofitagencies while participating in a seminar linking their practical experience with theoreticaland historical issues. There is an honors program for qualified students culminating in anextended senior thesis. The program draws on faculty active in the city's government, community, and non- profit agencies. The major provides particularly valuable preparation for students interestedin law, health, teaching, journalism, social work, architecture, city and regional planning,public policy, public administration, nonprofit administration, and community organization. An accelerated B.A./M.P .A. arrangement exists with NYU's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.

DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Professor Piotevin,Ross, Sennett, Siu, Townsend,Tchen, Zhang Program MAJOR Students majoring in metropolitan studies take two introductorysequence courses, four elective areacourses, and four research core cours-es, including the internship. Themajor is structured sequentially.With the introductory sequence, the student begins a general, compara-tive, and historical overview of citiesand how they change, comprehen-sively addressing cultural, political,and economic issues. The student then takes four electives that exploreparticular urban topics or issues.Thereafter the student develops hisor her interests through an intern-ship in a related area. Finally, tworesearch seminars enable the studentto develop skills in primary researchand written communication, as wellas data and policy analysis. The introductory sequence con- sists of Introduction to MetropolitanStudies, V99.0101 (or Societies and the Social Sciences: InterdisciplinaryPerspectives on Stud-ies, V55.0631) and Cities in theGlobal Context V99.0103. Addi-tionally, there a required researchcore of courses: V99.0401; Internship Seminar,V99.0402; in Metro-politan Studies, V99.0502. Students148 METROPOLITAN STUDIESmust complete one introductory sequence course before takingResearch Methods in MetropolitanStudies and two introductorysequence courses plus Research Meth-ods before taking Senior ResearchSeminar. Finally, students choose fourcourses in three elective areas of con-centration\u2014social welfare and publicpolicy, urban culture and identity,and the material city. MINOR The minor consists of four courses.Introduction to Metropolitan Stud-ies (or Societies and the Social Sci-ences: Interdisciplinary Perspectiveson Metropolitan Studies, V55.0631)is required.INTERNSHIP PROGRAM The internship complements andenhances the formal course work ofthe metropolitan studies program.Students intern at agencies dealingwith a range of urban issues andtake a corequisite seminar thatenables them to focus the workexperience in meaningful academicterms. Students majoring in metro-politan studies are required to takean internship, although many non-majors also enroll. The goals of theinternship are threefold: (1) to allowstudents to apply the theory theyhave gained through course work,(2) to provide students with the ana-lytical tools to improve urban life,and (3) to assist students in explor-ing professional career paths. HONORS PROGRAM Honors work consists of threesemesters (12-credits) of course workthat traditionally begins in the sec- ond semester of the student's thirdyear. (Students planning to goabroad should try to arrange theirschedules accordingly.) Honors studybegins in an honors section of theResearch Methods course in thespring of the junior year in whichstudents explore alternative researchmethodologies as they develop theirresearch proposal. Honors work cul-minates in an extended and sophisti-cated research project (60-75 pages)in a yearlong senior honors seminar.While they complete an individual-ized research project, the Seminarprovides faculty supervision in a col-lective environment. Honors stu-dents present and defend their com-pleted research before a committeeof metropolitan studies faculty. Forgeneral requirements, please seeunder Honors and Awards.

Permission ofthe instructor and the director ofundergraduate studies is required.For further information, please con-sult the Graduate School of Arts and Science Bulletin. The Department of Music offers a major and a minor in music, the requirements for which are set forth in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin. It also provides manycourses of interest to the entire NYU community. Department courses cover topics in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, theory and composition, popular music studies,historical performance, and jazz studies. Courses are available for students with no previousmusical experience as well as for those with some background in music.

The music depart-ment is located in a neighborhood (Greenwich Village) with a storied history of musical inno-vation. New York City is one of the most lively cities for musical performance, composition,and ethnomusicological study in the world. Students also have access to a major research col-lection in the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.DEPARTMENT OF Music (71) WAVERLY BUILDING, 24 WAVERLY PLACE, ROOM 268, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6789. 212-998-8300. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Averill DIRECTOR MUSICFacultyProfessors Emeriti: Burrows, Professor:Michael (Mick) Moloney Program MAJOR AND MINOR IN MUSIC The breadth and depth of knowledge offered by the major provides anexcellent foundation for careers relat-ed to the performance, creation, orstudy of music(s)\u2014including suchfields archiving, criticism,reviewing, documentation/folk-lore, and composition. An interdisci-plinary approach emphasizes theunderstanding of music as a culturalforce in multiple times and places. As such, the major is excellentpreparation for graduate study inmusic and other disciplines such asanthropology, performance studies,critical theory, comparative litera-ture, and theatre. The music major isalso ideal for any career demanding astrong liberal arts background and acommand of the written word. Themusic major cultivates the ability tointerpret and analyze music as bothtext and performance art. Studentscan expect to gain proficiency inWestern music theory; possess astrong sense of Western music histo- ry; study musics outside the Westernart canon such as jazz, popularmusic, and world musics; and havetransformational experiences withmusical sound. We expect our stu-dents to emerge as better musical\"citizens,\" more able to expressthemselves musically, betterequipped to understand their musi-cal choices and preferences, and hav-ing gained sophistication in theirunderstanding of their sound worlds.MUSIC 155MAJOR A total of 40 points is required, including Harmony and Counter-point I-IV (V71.0201-0204) and twocourses from ofthe two-year theory requirement,anyone considering the major inmusic should see the director ofundergraduate studies as early as pos-sible. Four other courses are requiredto complete the major: one in thearea of ethnomusicology, or any othercourses numbered above V71.0100(except V71.0505-0508) with theapproval of the director of undergrad-uate studies. Students should see thedepartmental Web site for semesterpostings of course(s) offered thatspecifically fulfill the major require-ments. All departmental coursesmust be passed with a grade of C orbetter to count toward the major. MINOR Four courses in the department arerequired. One must be chosen fromamong V71.0020 or V71.0201-0204 in consultation with the direc-tor of undergraduate studies. Threefurther Department of Music permitsdouble majors, but students arerequired to fulfill the requirementsof both departments. At the discre-tion of the director of undergraduatestudies, students from other schoolsat NYU may be permitted to elect adouble major or a minor in theDepartment of Music of the Collegeof Arts and Science, subject to thepolicies of the school in question. MUSICIANSHIP All majors in music must pass a key-board proficiency examinationadministered by the director ofundergraduate studies. Music majorsare expected to improve their musi-cianship in music courses and pri-vately. Students are strongly advisedto enroll in one of the performingensembles sponsored by the depart-ment, by the Center for Music Per-formance, or by the Steinhardt Schoolof Education Department of Musicand Performing Arts Professions, forwhich a maximum of 4 points of credit can count toward the degree.

They will workon an individual project in musicolo-gy or music history, ethnomusicolo-gy, analysis, or composition. Thismight take the form of an analyticalor historiographic study of a majorwork or group of works, the writingof a musical composition of substan-tial dimensions, or a biographicalstudy of a composer, all under theguidance of a faculty member. Pre-requisites include a grade point aver-age of 3.7 in music courses and 3.5overall. For general requirements, seeHonors and Awards. On the recom- mendation of the department, thestudent is entitled to an honors cita-tion at graduation. A student wish-ing to enroll should apply to thedirector of undergraduate studies. The three following prizes are awarded every year to students inthe department: the Elaine R. BrodyPrize, awarded to an outstandingmusic major in the junior class; theHanna van Vollenhollen MemorialPrize in Music, presented to major in thesenior class; the Isidore and HelenSacks Memorial Prize, awarded to anoutstanding music major or minorwho performs a recital sponsored bythe music department. Majors willbe given first consideration in yearswhere more than one recital is pre- sented. The department may choosenot to award the Sacks prize in agiven year. In addition, two dedicat-ed Dean's Undergraduate ResearchFunds for music students have beengenerously endowed: the MurrayHidary Scholarship Fund in Musicand the Julia C. Schieffelin Scholar-ship Fund. Awards from these funds are made on a competitive basis andmay be used for travel, recordingprojects, research costs, performancefees and other expenses incurred inthe pursuit of music research, com-position, and performance. PERFORMANCE Students pursuing a major or minorin music, and indeed all students inthe College of Arts and Science, areencouraged to participate in musicalperformance, lessons, and ensembles.We believe that the joys of making music, the dedication and study nec-essary to perform music, and the col-lective effort required of ensembleparticipants constitute an inimitableexperience that should have a centralplace in a liberal arts education. Stu-dents can participate in the musicdepartment's World Music Ensem-bles, the Collegium Musicum earlymusic ensemble, the NYU Orches-tra administered by the Center forMusic Performance, and many of thelesson programs and ensembles asso-ciated with the Steinhardt School ofEducation Department of Music andPerforming Arts Professions. Stu-dents are also urged to attend concerts of the Washington SquareContemporary Music Society. In addition to participation in the various performance ensembles, themusic department encourages studentsto partake vigorously of the culturallife of New York City.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES Qualified undergraduates may regis- ter for graduate courses, includingthe Collegium Musicum and the Eth-nomusicological Ensembles, with thepermission of the instructor and thedirector of undergraduate studies.Neural science is a collection of disciplines unified by a concern for the function of the brain. Experimental approaches in neural science vary from analyses of mole-cular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and groups of nerve cells to behav- ioral and psychological studies of whole organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematicaland computational modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science.Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and neurochemical mechanismswithin single nerve cells, functional neural circuits consisting of small numbers of neurons,the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the relationship between the activity of ele-ments of the nervous system and the behavior of organisms.

The four main branches are metaphysics (What is the ultimate nature ofreality? What really exists and what is mere appearance?); epistemology (What, if anything, can be known and how?); logic (What are the principles of correct reasoning?);and ethics (What is moral value? And what moral values should we adopt?). Other, morespecific, branches of philosophy address questions concerning the nature of art, law, medi-cine, politics, religion, and the sciences. Everyone tends to have or assume answers to these questions. The aim of the depart- ment is to enable students to identify, clarify, and assess these answers, both ancient andmodern. Philosophy prepares students for a more reflective life, for advanced studies in thesubject, as well as for professions that emphasize analytic thinking and argumentation, suchas law, business, and programming.DEPARTMENT OF Philosophy (83) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 503, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8320.

PHYSICS 163Physics at the College of Arts and Science is a multidimensional discipline. The department offers several tracks of study designed for preprofessional students as wellas aspiring physicists. A detailed curriculum is worked out for each student, with individual attention to progress and career plans. The physics major may participate in internationally recognized research activities carried out by the faculty. Some major areas of specialization include astrophysics, atomicphysics, condensed matter physics, and elementary particle physics. In addition to technical physics courses, the department offers general interest courses intended to broaden the scientific background of nonscience majors.DEPARTMENT OF Physics (85) ANDRE AND BELLA MEYER HALL OF PHYSICS, 4 WASHINGTON PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6621. 212-998-7700. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Zhang Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES The Department of Physics offers several programs for majors inphysics, leading to either the Bache-lor of Arts or the Bachelor of Sciencedegree. A minor in physics and aminor in astronomy are also offered.The basic B.A. major is particularlywell suited for preprofessional andother students who, while not plan-ning careers in physics, would like tohave the benefits and background ofan undergraduate major in physics.The B.A. intensive major is for stu-dents who plan to continue theirstudy of physics in graduate schoolor who intend to work in physics orrelated fields. The B.S. degree pro-vides some breadth in other sciences. In a joint program between New York University and Stevens Insti- tute of Technology, a physics majorat NYU can be combined with anengineering major at Stevens. Thefive-year program leads to a B.S.degree in physics and a B.E. degree in either civil engineering, electricalengineering, or mechanical engi-neering. For further information,contact Mr. Joseph Hemmes, coordi-nator of the B.S./B.E. program, atthe Advising Center, SilverCenter, 100 Washington SquareEast, Room 905; 212-998-8130. For students not majoring in physics, the following courses aresuitable for single electives, have noprerequisites, and assume no mathe-matical background beyond the highschool level. Of special interest tothe nonscience major are the follow-ing: Sound and Music, V85.0010;20th-Century Concepts of Space,Time, and Matter, V85.0020; The Universe: Its and History,V85.0007; Origins of Astrono-my, V85.0008. ObservationalAstronomy, V85.0013, is also ofinterest. While there are no prereq-uisites for this course, it is recom-mended that students takeV85.0007 or V85.0008 prior to enrolling in V85.0013. Physics is the most highly devel- oped of the natural sciences. For thisreason, it is frequently taken as theexemplar of the scientific method,the model for other quantitative sci-ences. Those trained in physics arefound in many occupations. A high-er degree opens the possibility ofcreative research in industry orteaching and research in colleges anduniversities. Men and women withdegrees in physics may be employedin various fields of engineering.Undergraduate training in physics isvaluable preparation for careers inmedicine and dentistry, computertechnology, environmental and earthsciences, communications, and sci-ence writing. It is fairly common forthose planning research careers inmolecular biology, chemical physics,or astronomy to major in physicswhile undergraduates. Because oftheir physical intuition, ability to164 PHYSICSdevelop abstract models, and exper- tise in quantitative reasoning, physi-cists are frequently members ofinterdisciplinary groups engaged instudying problems not directlyrelated to physics. SUGGESTED PROGRAMS FOR MAJORS IN PHYSICS The calculus requirement may be satisfied by taking Intensive Calcu-lus I, II, V63.0221, 0222, or Calcu-lus I, II, III, V63.0121, 0122, 0123.Students who take the Intensive Cal-culus sequence begin it in the fallsemester of their freshman year. Stu-dents who complete Intensive Calcu-lus I, II are encouraged to take Lin-ear Algebra, V63.0140, in the fallterm of the second year. Variationsof the following programs may beconstructed with the approval of thedirector of undergraduate studies. B.A. PROGRAMS Basic major in physics: Provides maximum flexibility for tailoring aprogram to the needs of a studentwho has a strong interest in anotherarea in addition to physics. Thosewishing to enter physics as a profes-sion should take the intensive major.The major in physics consists of thefollowing 3 or 4: two electives to be cho- sen from the physics courses num-bered V85.0110 and above. Intensive major in physics: Recommended for students planningto do graduate work in physics orrelated areas and for those who needa broader base in physics for theirwork in other fields. 1:V63.0221, V63.0222, advised to take advanced-level math-ematics courses. Consult with thedirector of undergraduate studies. Double major including physics: Offers the flexibility to complete the requirements for a sec-ond major in the College. Studentsmay wish to combine a major inphysics with a major in a field suchas mathematics, computer science,chemistry, economics, or biology.Students should consult the directorof undergraduate studies in theirfreshman year to outline a programthat is best tailored to their needs. B.S. PROGRAM Bachelor of Science in physics:The B.S. degree involves breadth inthe sciences in addition to the physicsmajor. The B.S. degree in physicswill be granted to students complet-ing the following, in addition to thestandard college requirements. (1) All courses required for the basic B.A. major, including elec-tives. (2) A semester of computerscience at or above the level of Intro-duction to Computer Science I,V22.0101. (3) Two semesters ofchemistry at or above the level ofCollege Chemistry I, II, V25.0101,0102. (4) An elective course in biol-ogy\u2014at or above the level of Princi-ples of Biology, V23.0011; or inchemistry\u2014above the level of Col-lege Chemistry II, V25.0102. Joint program with Stevens Institute of Technology: The department offers a five-year pro-gram leading to a B.S. (in physics)and a B.E. (in one of several engi-neering disciplines) in conjunctionwith Stevens Institute of Technolo-gy. Detailed programs of study areworked out in consultation with Mr.Joseph Hemmes, coordinator of theprogram, in the College of Arts andScience Advising Center, Silver Cen- ter, 100 Washington Square East,Room 905; 212-998-8130. MINORS Minor in physics: Provides the stu- dent with a general survey of thefield plus specialized study. Consistsof four of the following courses, orthree of the following courses plusone of the courses listed under theminor in astronomy: V85.0010,V85.0011 and 0012, V85.0019,V85.0020, and V85.0091except for V85.0094 and V85.0096.

Independent Study V85.0997, 0998 Prerequisite: of spring semester. 2-4 pointsper term.The faculty and program of the Department of Politics represent the five major fields of modern political science, namely, analytical politics, political theory, Americangovernment, comparative politics, and international politics. Many graduates of the program enter law school. However, the orientation of the department is not strictly preprofessional, and its students are well prepared to enter a num-ber of fields: teaching, business, journalism, government (including the foreign service),social work, urban affairs, and practical politics. For details on the undergraduate program,consult www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/undergrad/undergrad_requirements.shtml. The department sponsors a Washington Semester Program for which a limited number of students are accepted each semester. For details of this program, consult thedirector of undergraduate studies and www.american.edu/washingtonsemester/4.apply/4.0.html. The honors program provides an opportunity for outstanding students to under- take specialized advanced work and independent research during their junior and senioryears. For details on this program, see below and www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/undergrad/ undergrad_requirements.shtml#honors_program.DEPARTMENT OF Politics (53) 726 BROADWAY , 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-1567. 212-998-8500. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Bueno de Mesquita UNDER- Hafer, Hirano,Landa, McGillivray, Satyanath Program MAJOR The major requires ten 4-pointcourses (40 points) in the depart-ment chosen in consultation with adepartmental adviser and completedwith a grade of C or better. At leasttwo of these should be designatedcore courses (V53.0100, V53.0300,V53.0500, and V53.0700) andshould be taken before completionof the sophomore year. At least onecourse must be taken in three of thefive fields. Exceptions are made onlywith the approval of the director ofundergraduate studies. A politicsseminar and a foreign language orstatistics course are recommended,especially for students who plan to go on to graduate school. Onlycourses with a V53 number, whichare not also counted toward anothermajor or minor, can be countedtoward the politics major. The following internship and reading and research courses do notcount toward the major in politics:V53.0401, V53.0402, V53.0970,V53.0971, V53.0371, andV53.0990. The department also administers the major in international relations.For a description of this new major,see the Program in International Rela- tions (52) . HONORS PROGRAM For admission to and completion of the department's honors program,students must have and sustain aGPA of 3.5 overall and in the major.There are two deadlines for applyingto the honors program: October 1and March 1; admission to the hon-ors program permits students to reg-ister for the Junior Honors seminar(V53.0912), held in the junior year. In addition to other program requirements, honors students writea senior thesis in the fall or spring oftheir senior year while taking seniorhonors, V53.0930. The thesis isreviewed by a committee of at leastPOLITICS 167two faculty members during an oral examination. Successful completionof all honors requirements permitsstudents to graduate with honors inpolitics. Detailed information aboutthe program may be obtained at thedepartment. MINOR The minor requires five 4-pointcourses (20 points) in the departmentchosen in consultation with politicsdepartmental advisers and completedwith a grade of C or better. A minorprogram may reflect a special empha-sis in one of political science's fourfields or subfields such as prelaw.Only courses with a V53 number,which are not also counted towardanother major or minor, can becounted toward the politics minor. THE WASHINGTON SEMESTER PROGRAM This program is sponsored by the Department of Politics in conjunc-tion with American University.Seminars are taught by the faculty ofAmerican University in Washing- ton, DC. The full WashingtonSemester Program, totaling 16points, consists of one WashingtonSemester seminar (either V53.0301or V53.0302) for 8 points, oneinternship (V53.0970 or V53.0971)for 4 points, and one research project(V53.0990) for 4 points. Only theseminar (8 points) can be applied tothe requirements for a major in poli-tics. Applications may be submittedin October and March of each yearfor the following semester. OPTIONAL CONCENTRATIONS Majors may have optional concentra- tions. A concentration in the fieldsof political theory, American poli-tics, comparative politics, or interna-tional politics will consist of thecore course in the field plus fourother courses in that field. A concen-tration in analytical politics willconsist of any five courses in thefield. For the purpose of construct-ing a concentration in analytical pol-itics, the director of undergraduate studies may approve graduate cours-es to count toward the analyticalpolitics field. PRELAW Although law schools do not requireany particular major or course ofstudy, political science is an especial-ly useful field for students planninglegal study and a later career in law.For this reason, it is not surprisingthat, over the years, more law stu-dents have majored in this field thanin any other. The Association ofAmerican Law Schools has suggestedthat among the areas of importancein prelegal education are the studyof the political organization of soci-eties; the democratic processes ofWestern societies; the freedom of individuals; and the art of peaceful,orderly adaptation to change. Theassociation also suggests that stu-dents develop the power to thinkcreatively and analytically.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES 1000- and 2000-level courses are open to exceptional undergraduateswith an adequate background inpolitics. Requires written permis-sion of the instructor or, in his orher absence, the director of graduatestudies.Abroad liberal arts education\u2014which includes a general education (MAP) and a major in a liberal arts discipline or interdisciplinary field\u2014provides a sound foun-dation for many careers in business. The skills and perspectives of the liberal arts\u2014 in analysis, communication, etc.\u2014are practical as well as personally enriching. Liberal artsstudents, however, can considerably enhance their preparedness for business by also com-pleting a small number of more specific courses. In consultation with the UndergraduateCollege of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, the College of Arts and Science has iden-tified a set of such courses. These courses\u2014some offered by CAS and some by Stern\u2014areincorporated in the minor in prebusiness studies. By completing this CAS minor, studentswill have acquired core knowledge and quantitative skills that are invaluable assets for suc-cess in the business professions. Intended especially for students interested in the humanities, the minor in pre- business studies is open only to students in CAS and is administered by the college office.Students considering the minor should consult with the prebusiness adviser in the CollegePreprofessional Advising Office. This person's responsibilities include advising prospectiveand declared minors, evaluating the applicability of transfer credit, approving course sub-stitutions when warranted, and meeting with Stern on matters of CAS/Stern articulation.PROGRAM IN Pre-Business Studies Minor SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 901, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8160. 170 PRE-BUSINESS STUDIESProgram For a complete list of course descriptions, please visit cas.nyu.edu/page/bulletin.The minor consists of six courses, as indicated below. CAS COURSES: Economic Principles I V31.0001 4 points. Economic Principles II V31.0002 4 points. Algebra and Calculus with Appli- cations to Business V63.0017 4 points. orCalculus I V63.0121 4 points. orAP credit in Calculus (MathematicsAB or BC, with a score of 4 or 5) V31.0018 Introductory Statistics 6 points. This is the required statisticscourse. For students who have alreadytaken or are required by their major totake the following statistics courses, Sta-tistics may be substituted for Quantita-tive Reasoning for the Behavioral Sci- ences (Psychology), orMathematical Statistics (Mathematics),V93.0302 (4 points). Students makingsuch a substitution, however, are alsorequired to take Regression and Forecast-ing ,V31.0019 (2 points). STERN COURSES: Principles of Financial Account-ing C10.0001 4 points. Management and Organization Analysis C50.0001 4 points. No more than two of the above required courses may also be used to satisfy amajor or other minor requirement. Students whose major specifically requires three (or four) of the abovecourses must complete one (or both)of the following additional courses:Foundations of Financial Markets C15.0002 4 points. Industrial and Organizational Psychology V89.0062 Prerequisite: V89.0001. 4 points. The minimum acceptable grade in any of the courses to be countedtoward the minor is C, and the mini-mum overall grade point average inthe minor is 2.0. Students may countno more than two overlapping coursesfor both the prebusiness minor andtheir major or other minor. Thosemajoring or minoring in economicsor majoring in international relations,all of which require half or more ofthe courses required by the prebusi-ness minor, must therefore completeadditional courses, as indicated above. PSYCHOLOGY 171The Department of Psychology at NYU approaches the study of mind and behavior from many perspectives. Cognitive psychologists focus on perception, memory,attention, language, and thinking. Community psychologists consider the broader social context for healthy development and functioning. Experimental social psychologistsdetermine how social beliefs, attitudes, and decisions are formed and maintained. Thesemany perspectives are reflected in undergraduate course offerings, all of which emphasizethe scientific basis of psychology. In addition to its course offerings, the department encourages advanced under- graduates to become involved with the research of individual faculty through the ResearchExperiences and Methods and the honors program. Highly qualified students are admittedto the honors program in their sophomore or junior years, take special seminars, and writean honors research thesis under close faculty supervision. NYU psychology majors are well prepared for graduate study of the discipline and are accepted by top programs throughout the country. Others go on to careers in law, busi-ness, medicine, and education. DEPARTMENT OF Psychology (89) 6 WASHINGTON PLACE, ROOM 158, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6634. 212-998-7920.

Students who have received a5 on the psychology AP exam willreceive credit for the Introduction toPsychology course and can completethe major with the eight otherrequired courses or three other required courses for the minor. Stu-dents who receive a 4 on the APexam are exempt from taking theIntroduction to Psychology coursebut must substitute another psy-chology course to fulfill the require-ments of the major or minor. Entering students who have taken the Advanced PlacementExam in Statistics may also be eligi-ble for a modification of the stan-dard psychology major. Students who have received a 5 on the statis-tics AP exam will receive credit forthe Statistical Reasoning for theBehavioral Science course. Studentswho receive a 4 on the statistics APexam are exempt from taking theStatistical Reasoning for the Behav-ioral Science course but must substi-tute another psychology course tofulfill the requirements of the major. 172 PSYCHOLOGYIn addition, selected courses in other departments can be countedtoward the major or minor. A list isavailable from the psychologydepartment's Office of AcademicAffairs. MAJOR Nine 4-point courses includingIntroduction to Psychology,V89.0001; Statistical Reasoning forthe Behavioral Sciences, V89.0009;two courses from Core A (psycholo-gy as a natural science); two coursesfrom Core B (psychology as a socialscience); one laboratory course fromCore C; and two advanced electives.In order to declare a major or minorin psychology, a grade of C or bettermust be earned in Introductory Psy-chology, V89.0001. Credit towardthe major is not given for a course inthe major completed with a grade ofless than C. The curriculum involves a vari- ety of possible sequences of coursesthat proceed from introductory toadvanced. It is best that Introduc-tion to Psychology be taken first,preferably in the freshman year. Sta-tistics should be taken next as it laysthe methodological groundwork forthe research to be discussed in thecore courses. Statistics must beamong the first four psychologycourses taken. Core A and B coursesof greatest interest to the studentshould be taken early as preparationfor the relevant Core C laboratorycourse and advanced electives thatfollow. For instance, if a studentexpects to do graduate work in thearea of perception, then the Core Acourse Perception should be taken inthe sophomore year, so that Labora-tory in Perception and AdvancedSeminar in Perception can be takenlater. Students are discouraged fromtaking two Core A courses in thesame term. In general, it is advisable that students complete their Core C labo-ratory course requirement beforetaking advanced courses, preferablyby the spring of the junior year. GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS Students interested in graduate train- ing in psychology should becomeinvolved in research. Research Meth-ods and Experience, V89.0999, offersstudents the opportunity to partici-pate in faculty research, providingthem with a supervised research expe-rience as well as training in research presentation and criticism. Thiscourse is of great assistance to stu-dents in deciding about career direc-tions and, because of the direct con-tact with faculty involved, can resultin a letter of recommendation thatgraduate schools are likely to takevery seriously. Students who are particularly interested in graduate work in clini-cal psychology are encouraged toinclude Personality, V89.0030; Labo-ratory in Clinical and their selections. Developmen-tal V89.0034, anappropriate choice. The departmentprovides special advisement for stu-dents interested in graduate work inclinical areas of psychology and relat-ed fields. Contact the undergraduateprogram office for details. If the student plans to pursue a research career (particularly in CoreA areas), courses in mathematics,chemistry, biology, physics, andcomputer science will be most use-ful. If a career in business-organiza-tional psychology is the goal, theneconomics, sociology, and mathe-matics will be most useful. MINOR Four 4-point courses includingIntroduction to Psychology,V89.0001; one course from Core A;one course from Core B; and oneadvanced elective. In order to declarea minor in psychology, studentsmust have earned a grade of C orbetter in Introduction to Psycholo-gy, V89.0001. Credit toward theminor is not given for courses com-pleted with a grade of less than C.

Decisions by state, local, feder- al, and international organizations influence the quality of the environment, access tohealth care, international development, and the emergence of a global media indus- try. The minor in public policy, jointly developed and administered by the College of Artsand Science and the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, is designed forundergraduates interested in understanding such key issues and problems of the modernworld and in approaches to dealing with them. This interdisciplinary, interschool minor offers students a meaningful cluster of courses in a professional area where the liberal arts disciplines can provide important per-spectives. It also furthers several related goals: it links the classroom to the city, encouragesstudents to apply their theoretical learning, and provides a minor that is coherent and sub-stantial, in that it entails five courses. An executive committee of College of Arts and Science and Wagner School of Pub- lic Service faculty oversees the public policy minor. For each track, there is a designatedadviser to students. For communications and the media, it is Professor Michael Ludlum,Department of Journalism and Mass Communication, 10 Washington Place, Room 605B,212-998-7972. For health, it is Ms. Ruchel Ramos, Wagner School, 4 Washington SquareNorth, Room 24, 212-998-7477. For international development, it is Professor RomanFrydman, Department of Economics, 269 Mercer Street, Room 830, 212-998-8967. Alsoavailable to advise students in this minor is Ms. Anne Blatz, a staff adviser in the CollegeAdvising Center, Room 905, Silver Center, 212-998-8130.PROGRAM IN Public Policy (89) Minor SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 905, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8130.

We seek to understand the full range of social institutions and practices, from couples and smallgroups to organizations such as businesses and government agencies, to the function- ing of communities, cities, and nations. Our methods of research are diverse, ranging fromthe quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches such as in-depth inter-viewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen, an expert in some special field, or a socially active trailblazer, we offer the tools and knowledge to help students make senseof the world around them. Students preparing for careers in law, social service, health, pub-lic administration, and other professional areas will find sociology an excellent major andcan choose from many relevant substantive courses. Those interested in social research andpolicymaking will benefit especially from courses that teach practical skills of data gather-ing and analysis. In all of these courses, we encourage students to study issues from a vari-ety of perspectives, to develop a critical awareness of social life, and to use a \"sociologicalimagination\" to analyze social problems and act effectively. NYU's Department of Sociology reflects the scope of our discipline. The faculty includes experts in a variety of fields, including gender studies and the family; crime, law,and deviance; political sociology, including social movements and policy; economy; education; inequality; community and urban life; social theory; and culture.The full range of our course offerings is shown in the listing of courses below.DEPARTMENT OF Sociology (93) 269 MERCER STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687. 212-998-8340.

ARREARS POLICY The University reserves the right todeny registration and withhold allinformation regarding the record ofany student who is in arrears in thepayment of tuition, fees, loans, orother charges (including charges forhousing, dining, or other activitiesor services) for as long as any arrearsremain. GRADUATION POLICY No candidate may be recommendedfor a degree until all outstandingbills have been paid. The Universitycannot be responsible for the inclu-sion in the current official graduationlist of any candidate who pays feesafter the first day of May, September,or January for degrees in May, Sep-tember, or January, respectively. Following the payment of all required fees and on approval of thefaculty, the candidate will be recom-mended for the degree as of the dateof the next regular meeting of theUniversity Board of Trustees atwhich the awarding of degrees is apart of the order of business. WITHDRAWAL AND REFUND OF TUITION A student who for any reason finds it impossible to complete a coursefor which he or she has registeredshould consult with an academicadviser in the College Advising Cen-ter, Silver Center, Room 905, andfile a completed Change of Programform with the Office of the Bursar.(Note: An official withdrawal must be filed if a course has been can-celed, and, in this case, the studentis entitled to a refund of tuition andregistration fees paid.) Withdrawaldoes not necessarily entitle the stu-dent to a refund of tuition paid or acancellation of tuition still due. Arefund of tuition will be made pro-vided such withdrawal is filed with-in the scheduled refund period forthe term (see schedule below). Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official with-drawal, nor does notification to theinstructor. A stop payment of acheck presented for tuition does notconstitute withdrawal, nor does itreduce the indebtedness to the Uni-versity. The nonreturnable registra- tion fee and a penalty fee of $10.00for a stopped payment must becharged in addition to any tuitionnot canceled. The date on which the Change of Program form is filed, not the lastdate of attendance in class, is consid-ered the official date of the student'swithdrawal. It is this date thatserves as the basis for computing anyrefund granted the student. The refund period (see schedule below) is defined as the first fourcalendar weeks of the term for whichapplication for withdrawal is filed.The processing of refunds takesapproximately two weeks. REFUND PERIOD SCHEDULE (FALL AND SPRING TERMSONLY) This schedule is based on the total applicable charge for tuition, exclud-ing nonreturnable fees and deposits. Withdrawal before the official opening date of the term: .............100% Withdrawal within the first calendar week from theopening date of the term:........100% The first calendar week consists of the first seven (7) calendar days beginningwith the official opening date of theterm. (Note: not the first day of the class meeting.) Withdrawal within the second calendar week from theopening date of the term:..........70% Withdrawal within the third calendar week from theopening date of the term:..........55% Withdrawal within the fourth calendar week from theopening date of the term:..........25% Withdrawal after completion of the fourth calendar weekof the term:...........................NONE The above refund schedule is not applicable to students whose regis-tration remains within the flat-fee range. Note: A student may not withdraw from a class after the ninth week ofthe fall or spring semester or the lasttwo weeks of each summer session. 1Students automatically enrolled in the Basic Plan or the Comprehensive Plan can changebetween plans, waive the plan entirely (andshow proof of other acceptable health insur-ance), or select the UHC Only plan.200 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AIDThe registration and services fee is in no case returnable. Exceptions to the published refund schedule may be appealed inwriting to the refund committee inthe College Advising Center, SilverCenter, Room 905, and should besupported by appropriate documenta-tion regarding the circumstances thatwarrant consideration of an exception. Federal regulations require adjustments reducing financial aid ifa student withdraws even after theNYU refund period. Financial aidamounts will be adjusted for stu-dents who withdraw through theninth week of the semester and havereceived any federal grants or loans. This adjustment may result in thestudent's bill not being fully paid.NYU will bill the student for thisdifference. The student will beresponsible for payment of this billbefore returning to NYU and willremain responsible for payment evenif he or she does not return to NYU. For any semester a student receives any aid, that semester will becounted in the satisfactory academicprogress standard. This may requirethe student to make up credits beforereceiving any further aid. Pleasereview the \"satisfactory academicprogress\" standard for your school soyou do not jeopardize future semes- ters of aid. Students who withdrawshould review the \"Refund\" page onthe NYU Office of the Bursar Website (www.nyu.edu/bursar). TUITION INSURANCE NYU encourages all students to pur- chase tuition insurance, in case awithdrawal after the refund periodbecomes necessary. Please contactA.W .G.

Financial Aid New York University awards finan- cial aid in an effort to help studentsmeet the difference between theirown resources and the cost of educa-tion. All awards are subject to avail-ability of funds and the student'sdemonstrated need. Renewal of assis-tance depends on annual reevaluationof a student's need, the availability offunds, the successful completion ofthe previous year, and satisfactoryprogress toward completion of degreerequirements. In addition, studentsmust meet the published filing deadlines. Detailed informationabout financial aid is forwarded withthe admission application and is also available on the Office of Finan-cial Aid Web site, www.nyu.edu/ financial.aid , as well as in the Student's Guide to NYU , available from the Office of Student Life, Kimmel Cen-ter for University Life, 60 Washing-ton Square South, Suite 601. Many awards are granted purely on the basis of scholastic merit, whileothers are based on financial need. Itis frequently possible to receive acombination of awards based on both.University scholarships or fellowshipsmay be granted by themselves or inconjunction with student loans orFederal Work-Study employment. Toensure that maximum sources ofavailable support will be investigated,students must apply for financial aidby the appropriate deadline. It is the student's responsibility to supply true, accurate, and com-plete information and to notify theOffice of Financial Aid immediatelyof any changes or corrections in hisor her housing status or financial sit-uation, including tuition remissionbenefits or outside grants, onceapplication has been made. A student who has received a financial aid award mustinform their department and the Office of Finan-cial Aid if he or she subsequentlydecides to decline all or part of thataward. To neglect to do so preventsuse of the award by another student.If a student has not claimed his orher award (has not enrolled) by theclose of regular (not late) registrationand has not obtained written per-mission from his or her departmentand the Office of Financial Aid foran extension, the award may be can-celed, and the student may becomeineligible to receive scholarship orfellowship aid in future years. Determination of financial need is also based on the number of cours-es for which the student indicates heor she intends to register. A changein registration therefore may necessi-tate an adjustment in financial aid. HOW TO APPLY Students must submit the FreeApplication for Federal Student Aid(FAFSA), and later, New York Stateresidents must also complete thepreprinted New York State TuitionAssistance Program (TAP) applica-tion, which is mailed automatically tothe student by the New York StateHigher Education Services Corpora-tion (HESC) after the FAFSA isprocessed.

Within theselimits, students may borrow up tothe difference between the cost ofeducation, the family contribution,and the total of all financial aidawards. For dependent students,\"family contribution\" is derivedfrom the incomes of the parents andthe student. For graduate studentsand independent undergraduates,family contribution is based on theincomes of the student and spouse(if married). The subsidized Stafford Student Loan interest rate for all students isvariable with a cap of 8.25 percent.Interest does not accrue, however,nor does repayment begin, until sixmonths after the borrower ceases toenroll at least half time.

Students must beginto repay interest and principal 60days after the first loan funds areissued. Payment of the principal maybe deferred if the student is enrolledat least half-time for the period of theloan.

Parent Loans for Undergradu- ate Students Program (PLUS).The federal Parent Loans for Under-graduate Students Program enablescreditworthy parents of dependentundergraduate students to borrowup to an amount equal to the cost ofeducation minus all other financialaid. No aggregate borrowing limitsapply. The annual interest rate is set by a federal formula and does notexceed 9 percent. For this reason,eligible parents are strongly encour-aged to choose a federal PLUS loanbefore applying for a private educa-tional loan. Repayment of thePLUS loan typically begins within60 days after funds are disbursedand may extend up to 10 years. Aninsurance premium/guarantee fee ofup to 4 percent is due at the time ofdisbursement.

To be eligible for the bachelor's degree, students must complete 128 points with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Within these points, students must fulfillthe requirements of both a major and the Morse Academic Plan (MAP). The degree requirements to be fulfilled are those in effect during the term of the student's first registration in the College. Registration in another division of New YorkUniversity does not constitute a registration in the College of Arts and Science. Readmitted students must fulfill the requirements as listed in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin published during the year of their readmission, unless their readmis-sion letter states otherwise. In very exceptional cases, a student may petition the Committee on Undergradu- ate Academic Standards for approval of a change in the requirements as stated in the bul-letin. The petition form may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean for Stu-dents, Silver Center, Room 909B.Degree Requirements Conferring of DegreesDegrees are conferred in September, January, and May. The formal confer-ring of degrees by the president ofthe University takes place annually at Commencement in May.

Generally, alittle more than one-third of the total points are earned in the majorconcentration. Every student must complete a major with a cumulative grade pointaverage in the major of at least 2.0. One-half of the courses (and in somedepartments, one-half of the points)used to complete the major must betaken in the College of Arts and226 DEGREE REQUIREMENTSScience. The student must be accept- ed as a major in the department andmust review his or her program witha department adviser each term. DECLARATION OF MAJOR Students go to the office of the depart-ment or program in question todeclare a major and have it posted inthe Student Information System. Stu-dents who have earned 64 or more points must declare a major. Thosewith fewer than 64 points are stronglyencouraged to declare a major as earlyin their academic career as possible. DOUBLE MAJOR Students may take a double (second)major. The same requirements,including the maintenance of a min-imum grade point average of 2.0, apply to the second major as to thefirst. In some cases, courses may beapplicable to both majors. Studentsmust then obtain the writtenapproval for the course(s) from thedirectors of undergraduate studies ofboth departments. The second majoris declared in the same way as thefirst (see above). The Minor The minor requirements are found inthe departmental sections of the bul-letin. The minor must be completedwith a minimum grade point aver-age of 2.0. Except for the minors ineducation, studio art, and social work, one-half of the courses used tocomplete the minor must be Collegeof Arts and Science courses. Theminor is declared at the office of thesponsoring department or program. No more than one minor can becompleted outside of the College inorder for the credits to count towardthe degree requirement. Regulations Pertaining to Both Major and MinorThe major and minor requirements to be followed are those stated in thedepartmental sections of the bulletinin effect during the semester of thestudent's first registration in the Col-lege. No credit toward the major orminor is granted for grades of C- orlower, although such grades will becomputed into the grade point aver-age of the major or the minor, aswell as into the overall grade point average. No course to be counted toward the major or minor may be taken ona pass/fail basis (see \"Pass/FailOption\" under Academic Policies). Except for the minors in educa- tion, prebusiness studies, studio art,and social work, no courses given inother NYU divisions may be count-ed toward the major or minor, and only one minor from among theseprograms will count toward the 128-credit degree requirement. Transferstudents from other colleges and uni-versities must have the writtenapproval of the director of under-graduate studies to count transfercourses toward the major or theminor. Time Limit All requirements for a degree in the College must be met within a periodof eight years from the date ofmatriculation. For transfer studentsand for students who are readmitted to the College, the length of time isproportionately reduced. Transfercredit is not granted for coursestaken more than 10 years before the student's matriculation in theCollege. Residence RequirementAll students must complete their last 32 points while registered in theCollege of Arts and Science. In addi-tion, students must be registered inthe College during the semesterimmediately prior to graduation,unless officially approved for a leaveof absence in that semester. One-half of the courses used to complete themajor or the minor must be taken inthe College. Any transfer courses tobe applied toward major or minorrequirements must be approved bythe department. Registration inanother undergraduate division of NYU does not constitute registra-tion in the College for any purposes,including fulfillment of the residencerequirement or completion of thelast 32 points. Transfer StudentsTransfer students must complete 64 points in the College with a cumu-lative grade point average of at least2.0 overall, in the required major,and in the optional minor.

Courses in which a grade ofC- or lower was obtained are nottransferable.PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS 227Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs Internships One defining characteristic of the New York University educationalexperience is the opportunity stu-dents have to apply their classroomlearning to real-life experiences in avariety of professional and communi-ty service settings. New York Cityprovides such opportunities in abun-dance, and the College of Arts andScience and the University take fulladvantage of our location in thefinancial, cultural, scientific, andmedia capital of the world. Ouralumni base, for example, encompass-es every conceivable profession, andalumni give generously of their timeto undergraduate students seekingexperiential learning. A recent survey by the Universi- ty's Office of Career Services showedthat 83 percent of graduating seniorsin the College held a job or intern-ship related to their field of interestduring their undergraduate years.Many different types of opportunitiesare available to students: some arepaid, some involve voluntarism onthe part of a student, and some carryacademic credit\u2014and all of these canbe valuable. For the purpose of secur-ing and making the most of suchopportunities, students should con-sider the following criteria as a guide: 1. Paid Internships: These are the most common form of internship.Jobs related to a student's profession-al interests provide pay for the workthat students are doing for the orga-nization. Many companies and orga-nizations provide part-time jobs that allow students to gain experience andto network in the field, while at thesame time helping to alleviate thefinancial burden of being a collegestudent. (Please note: some for-profitcompanies ask students to volunteer,but allow it only if the student canearn academic credit. Many of theseso-called internships do not relatedirectly to a student's academic workand are not worthy of academic creditin a discipline. In these cases, thecompany should consider providingcompensation for the work done by astudent, thus making it a paidinternship.) 2. Voluntary or Community Service: Certain organizations encourage students to work on a vol-unteer basis in order to gain experi-ence and to provide needed assistanceto the organization. This type ofarrangement, for example, is com-mon in government and not-for-prof-it organizations. Such internships arevalued, sometimes even required, foradmission to some professionalschools. But the College awards nocredit for them. 3. Credit-Bearing Internships: A few departments offer academicinternships that directly advance astudent's knowledge in the academicdiscipline and thus earn course credit.Such academic internships must besponsored by an appropriate facultymember through an academic depart-ment and normally require close fac-ulty supervision, significant research in addition to the practical workexperience, a reporting of findings,and a formal assessment of the stu-dent's work. All such internshipsrequire permission of the departmentor program, and registration for themmust be within the regular deadlines.Departments offering credit-bearinginternships may restrict them todeclared majors, since those studentshave the requisite background.Internship courses can be countedtoward some majors but not towardothers. Students should check rele-vant Web sites to learn more aboutthe specific policies and procedurespertaining to credit-bearing intern-ships in different departments andprograms. 4. Independent Study: In some departments, independent study thatis somehow draws on the activity orenvironment of the internship maybe a possibility. Like a credit-bearinginternship, independent study wouldrequire a proposal by the student,careful guidance from a faculty mem-ber, and a body of work that can beevaluated for course credit. For further information, see \"The Career Assistance Program\" underStudent Activities, University Services, or make an appointment with a careercounselor at the PreprofessionalAdvising Center, Silver Center, 100Washington Square East, ProgramThe prehealth program the Col- lege of Arts and Science is designedfor any student who wishes to under-take preprofessional preparation forapplication to medical, dental, veteri-nary, osteopathic medical, optometry,or podiatry school. The program ofstudy for a student interested in anyof these areas minimally requirescompletion of the following courses:Principles I and II,V23.0011, V23.0012; GeneralChemistry I, V25.0101, Introductionto General Chemistry I Laboratory, General Chemistry II,V25.0102, Introduction to GeneralChemistry II Laboratory, V25.0104;Organic Chemistry I, V25.0243,Organic Chemistry I Laboratory,V25.0245; Organic Chemistry II,V25.0244, Organic Chemistry IILaboratory, V25.0246; GeneralPhysics I and II, V85.0011,V85.0012; Writing the Essay,V40.0100, and one elective from theEnglish Department; and Calculus I,V63.0121. Some professional schools may require additional courses. While striving to earn the best grades possible, prehealth studentsmust also keep in mind that schoolsof the health professions look at everyaspect of a candidate's backgroundwhen making admission decisions.Therefore, students are encouraged topursue a major of heartfelt interest,to participate in extracurricular activ-ities of their choosing, and to developintellectual pursuits and hobbies out-228 PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMSside their schoolwork. Additionally, all prehealth students are very strong-ly encouraged to get either paid orvolunteer work experience in the areathey would like to follow. The reason for this experience is twofold: students will be able to makean intelligent decision about whetheror not they should pursue this profes-sion, and admissions committees cansee that an applicant is dedicatedenough to find out about a particularprofession and that he or she has madean attempt to become aware of bothits positive and its negative aspects. The College's Preprofessional Advisement Office, Silver Center,Room 901, telephone: 212-998-8160, has an extensive evaluationprocess that enables the chair of the Committee on Recommendations toSchools of the Health Professions towrite a letter of recommendationusing information from as manysources as possible. Students fill outevaluation forms each semester.Additionally, students preparing forthe admissions tests and subsequentapplication undergo an extensiveinterview process during the springsemester before application. Stu-dents are encouraged to keep intouch with the PreprofessionalAdvisement Office so that they areinformed about deadlines for theevaluation procedures. Any student considering a career in one of the health professions isstrongly urged to discuss this with their academic adviser as early as pos-sible. Being \"premed\" is not a major,does not affect earning one's degree,and is not an irrevocable commit-ment should the student change hisor her mind. The PreprofessionalAdvisement Office will also help students from other NYU divisionswho wish to follow a prehealth curriculum. Much more detailedinformation about the undergraduateexperience as a prehealth student,about health schools, and about theapplication process is available in thePreprofessional Advisement Office.Advisers there can help students atevery stage of their prehealth careers. Accelerated and Joint ProgramsACCELERATED THREE-YEAR PROGRAM IN MEDICINE The College offers a combined pro- gram with AAMC-approved collegesof medicine in the United Stateswhereby a student who completes inthree years the required work in pre-medical sciences, the requirements ofa major, and the requirements of theMorse Academic Plan may receivethe Bachelor of Arts degree on com-pletion of the first year and promo-tion to the second year of medicalschool. Such students must havecompleted at least 104 points of workin the College of Arts and Science. Inorder to qualify for the Bachelor ofArts degree under this program, stu-dents must maintain matriculation inthe College of Arts and Science whiletaking the first year of medical work,and they must submit an official copyof the first-year medical school tran-script to the chair of the Committeeon Recommendations to Schools ofthe Health Professions. In addition,they must submit a statement fromthe medical school indicating thatthey have been promoted to the sec-ond year of medical studies. Admission to medical school after three years of undergraduatecollege work is extremely rare and isgranted only to exceptionally well-qualified candidates. EARLY DECISION PROGRAM FOR ADMISSION TO NEWYORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOLOF MEDICINE Premedical students in the College of Arts and Science may make formalapplication to the School of Medicinebefore the regular opening date for applications. They will be notified ofthe School of Medicine's decision bymid-July.

Barbara and Evan Chesler Prelaw ProgramProspective law students are free to choose from the wide variety of cours-es offered at the College of Arts andScience. The College endorses theposition of the Association of Ameri-can Law Schools that a single \"best\"preparation for law school cannot berecommended. As a result, there is noprescribed prelaw curriculum. PURPOSE OF PRELAW STUDY While the College considers the pre- scription of particular courses unwise,it recognizes an essence of undergrad-uate instruction it believes fundamen-tal to the attainment of legal profes-sion. Courses that require extensivereading, research, and writing shouldtherefore be undertaken. The Col-lege's core curriculum is an excellentbeginning for prelaw students since itoffers a rigorous and multidiscipli-nary foundation for advanced study inthe humanities, social sciences, andnatural sciences. The honors pro-grams offered by several departmentsprovide opportunities to do extensive written work during the junior andsenior years. Second, the precision ofmethodology and thought required ofstudents in mathematics, computerscience, logic, and the natural scienceswill aid in the development of analyt-ic skills. Finally, a background in thebehavioral sciences and the humani-ties (politics, economics, history, liter-ature, philosophy, anthropology, andsociology) is suggested since each willoffer a critical understanding of thehuman institutions and values withwhich the law deals. ADVISING The services of the Prelaw AdvisingOffice, Silver Center, Room 901, tele-phone: 212-998-8160, are availableto students seeking consultation ongeneral course selection, law schoolapplications, and related issues. Theoffice serves as a clearinghouse for thedean's certification, required by anumber of law schools as part of theiradmissions process.

International Student ExchangesStudents at New York University have the opportunity to study abroadfor a semester or an academic year atoutstanding urban universities as partof their NYU education. Among theEuropean and British universitiesparticipating in the exchange are theUniversities of Amsterdam (theNetherlands), Stockholm Universities in Berlin(Germany); the University of Flo-rence and the European UniversityInstitute (EUI) Florence (Italy);Charles University (Czech Republic); Comenius the Institute of Madrid (Spain); TrinityCollege (Dublin, and RoyalHolloway (England). In Latin Ameri-ca, participants include PontificalCatholic University of Chile (PUC)(Santiago) and the Korea),and Yonsei University (Nagoya, Japan). (Note: Ewha's international program is coed). NYU students whoparticipate in an exchange remainmatriculated at NYU, pay NYUtuition, and receive financial aid as ifthey were attending classes at Wash-ington Square. Students apply for theexchange after consulting with theiracademic adviser. For further infor-mation, contact the College of Artsand Science Advising Center, 100Washington Square East, Room 905, New York, NY 10003-6688; 212-998-8130; global.exchanges@nyu.edu.ACADEMIC POLICIES 237Academic Policies Academic ProgramThe programs and courses offered at the College of Arts and Science aredesigned for students who attendclasses offered during the day on afull-time basis. A full-time schedulenormally consists of 16 points perterm, or 32 points per year, whichenables a student to complete theentire program of 128 points in fouryears. Minimal full-time statusentails completing at least 12 pointsper term or 24 points per year. Stu-dents who wish to attend part timeshould obtain permission from theOffice of the Associate Dean for Stu-dents. Such status will be grantedonly when there is good and suffi-cient reason for part-time study. Fail-ure to complete a minimum of 24points per year jeopardizes a student'sfull-time status and his or her eligi-bility to receive financial aid. Students in good academic stand- ing may register for more than 18points per term with the approvaland clearance of their academic advis-er. Students on academic probation,however, who wish to register formore than 18 points per term mustobtain the prior approval of the Com-mittee on Academic Standards, asmust any other student wishing toregister for more than 20 points. Change of program. To make any changes in their program,including dropping or adding coursesgiven in other divisions of the Uni-versity, students must access Albertat www.albert.nyu.edu or call Torch- Tone at 212-995-4747 or file aChange of Program form in the Stu- dent Services Center, 25 West FourthStreet. Adding courses. The deadline for the adding of a course or a sectionis the end of the second week of thesemester. The deadline applies to anycourse added by a College of Arts andScience student and to any College ofArts and Science course added by stu-dents from other divisions. Theadding of any course or section afterthe end of the second week is gener-ally allowed only when the student ischanging levels within a discipline\u2014for example, from a French or mathe-matics course to a higher- or lower-level course in the same discipline.The addition is permitted only withthe written approval of both theinstructor and an adviser in the Col-lege Advising Center. Withdrawing from courses. Students are expected to maintain afull-time program as described above.Occasionally, they may withdrawfrom a course if, because of reasonsbeyond their control, they cannotcontinue. Courses dropped duringthe first three weeks of the term willnot appear on the transcript. Thosedropped from the beginning of thefourth week through the ninth weekof the term will be recorded with agrade of W . After the ninth week, noone may withdraw from a course.Students who are ill or have a seriouspersonal problem should see, call, orwrite to an adviser in the CollegeAdvising Center, College of Arts andScience, New York University, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East,Room 905, New York, NY 10003-6688; 212-998-8130. Complete withdrawals. Stu- dents who wish to withdraw from alltheir courses must make an appoint-ment for an interview with an adviserin the College Advising Center. A student who withdraws official- ly from all courses in a term may reg-ister for the following term. If thestudent is unable to attend the Col-lege during the term following thewithdrawal, he or she should requesta leave of absence from an adviser inthe College Advising Center. Formore information, see \"Attendance,\"below. Auditing. Matriculated students in the College may audit (i.e., attendlectures without intending to receivecredit) any course in the College withthe consent of, and under the condi-tions established by, the instructorand the department. Auditors maynot preempt space required for regis-tered students. Courses cannot beaudited as a means of satisfyingrequirements for an incomplete gradeor as a means of changing a previousgrade. A student cannot register as an auditor, and audited courses will notappear on the student's official tran-script. Special (nondegree) studentsmay not audit courses. AttendanceAlthough the administration of theCollege does not supervise attendanceof classes, it supports the standardsimposed by instructors. Students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not substan-tially met the requirements of thecourse or who have been excessivelyabsent may be considered to havewithdrawn unofficially and may begiven the final grade of F. See\"Withdrawing from courses,\" above.RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS AND ATTENDANCE New York University, as a nonsectari- an institution, adheres to the generalpolicy of including in its official cal-endar only certain legal holidays.However, it has also long been Uni-versity policy that members of anyreligious group may, without penalty,absent themselves from classes whencompliance with their religiousobligations requires it. In 1988, the University Senate affirmed this policyand passed a resolution that elaborat-ed on it as follows: 1. Students who anticipate being absent because of any religious obser-vance should, whenever possible,notify faculty in advance of suchanticipated absence. 2. Whenever feasible, examina- tions and assignment deadlinesshould not be scheduled on religious238 ACADEMIC POLICIESholidays. Any student absent from class because of religious beliefs shallnot be penalized for any class, exami-nation, or assignment deadlinemissed on that day or days.3. If examinations or assignment deadlines are scheduled, any studentwho is unable to attend class becauseof religious beliefs shall be given the opportunity to make up that dayor days.4. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student who availshim/herself of the above provisions. Credit CREDIT FOR ADVANCED PLACEMENT EXAMINATIONS The College participates in the Advanced Placement Program of theCollege Entrance Examination Board.Students who have taken AdvancedPlacement exams while in highschool should have the EducationalTesting Service in Princeton forward their official scores to the Office ofUndergraduate Admissions, 22Washington Square North; 212-998- 4500. No credit is given for AP teststaken after the completion of highschool. In most subjects, if the scorereceived is four or five, credit will begranted. If such credit is granted,students should not retake thatcourse for credit in the College. Ifthey choose to do so, they will auto-matically lose the Advanced Place-ment credit. For more information,see the \"Advanced Placement Equiva-lencies\" chart in the Admission section of this bulletin. CREDIT FOR COURSES AT THE COLLEGE To receive credit for a course, the stu- dent must register before attending,meet the requirements for atten-dance, and satisfactorily complete allexaminations and assignments pre-scribed by the instructor. For excep-tional students, most departmentsalso offer independent study. TheCollege does not permit students toregister as auditors. RESTRICTIONS ON RECEIVING CREDIT No credit is granted for the successful completion of only the first term of afull-year course, except by the per-mission of the director of undergrad-uate studies of the department inwhich the course is taken. Full-yearcourses are denoted by a hyphenbetween numbers, such as inV27.0003-0004. A student who has earned credit for a course may repeat it once (a\"W\" obtained on first registration fora course does not count in these cal- culations). Students may not repeatcourses in a designated sequence aftertaking more advanced courses; how-ever, the sequencing of courses isdetermined by the departments. Stu-dents with questions regarding therepetition of courses or coursesequences must consult with the par-ticular department offering thecourse. When a student repeats acourse, no additional credit will beawarded. Both grades will be record-ed, but only the latter will be com-puted in the grade point average andhave credit awarded. No course canbe taken for a grade more than twice.Students should be aware that certaingraduate schools, including dental,medical, and law schools, will countboth grades for a repeated course inthe average. A limited number of credits may be earned by those in the militaryservices who take correspondencecourses in colleges approved by theUnited States Armed Forces Insti-tute. Students may not be registeredat another university at the sametime that they are registered in theCollege of Arts and Science. CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER SCHOOLS AND DIVISIONS OF NEW YORKUNIVERSITY Courses may be taken in the New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science; 1000-level graduatecourses may be taken as described inthe departmental sections of this bul-letin, and 2000-level graduate cours-es may be taken with writtenapproval of the instructor. If graduatecourses are applied toward the com-pletion of requirements for the bac-calaureate degree, no advanced creditis allowed for them in the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science. It is also possible for students to take courses in other undergraduatedivisions of New York University andto have credits for these coursesapplied to the degree in the College. Students may take a total of 16points in other divisions. Transfer students should note that credits fornonliberal arts courses (e.g., business,applied art, speech) taken at anotherinstitution count as part of the 16points. The following exceptionapplies: Students are permitted totake up to 24 points in other divi-sions to complete their program, asprescribed, if they are formallymatriculated in one of the followingcombined .A.or B.S./B.E. program. Please note that restrictions apply. Courses in other divisions that dupli-cate the contents of a College of Artsand Science course do not counttoward the College degree. Fordetails, students must check with anadviser in the College Advising Cen-ter before registering for any coursesin other divisions. If a course is notapproved, students will not receivecredit for it. Independent study orinternship courses taken in other divi-sions of the University do not counttoward the College degree. If suchcourses are taken at schools outsidethe University, the credit will nottransfer to the College. Also excluded from credit toward the degree are any courses taken inthe School of Continuing and Profes-sional Studies once a student is regis-tered in the College. Credit for Internet and online courses will not be counted towardthe B.A. degree. SUMMER SESSION Once admitted to the College, stu-dents take all courses here, includingthose they need or wish to take duringthe summer. Exceptions are grantedonly rarely and only for good academicreasons. Requests should be made toan adviser in the College AdvisingCenter, Silver Center, Room 905. Information about summer course offerings is available during the pre-ceding fall and spring terms, as isinformation about dormitory facilitiesavailable to students who usuallycommute.ACADEMIC POLICIES 239Examinations and GradesCREDIT FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS Students are allowed to transfer up to 64 credits to the College. Creditsbased on semester hours are acceptedfrom other institutions at face valueand are not altered when they aretransferred into the College. Quarterhours will be converted to semesterhours to determine the number ofcredits transferable to the College ofArts and Science. Non-liberal artscredits are not always transferable.Only credits for course work takenwith a grade of C or better will betransferred. Courses taken for apass/fail grade will not transfer to theCollege. FINAL EXAMINATIONS When final examinations are missedbecause of illness, a doctor's notemust be presented to the instructor,who may give a grade of Incomplete.See below for an outline of proceduresfor taking makeup examinations. MAKEUP EXAMINATIONS As noted under \"Grades,\" below, astudent who cannot take the finalexamination in a course at the regu-larly scheduled time may be giventhe grade of Incomplete. The studentmust discuss the reasons for missingthe examination with the instructorand, in the case of illness, must sub-mit a doctor's note to the instructor.The student must ask the instructorto give a grade of Incomplete. Incom-pletes are not awarded automatically.The time and place of any makeupexaminations are set by the instructoror the department. (Regarding the removal of Incom- pletes received for missed work otherthan final examinations, see under\"Grades\" and \"Incompletes,\" below.)Incomplete grades received because ofa missed final examination must beremoved within the semester follow-ing the one in which the Incompletewas received. In the case of studentswho are out of attendance, suchgrades must be removed within oneyear after the end of the course con-cerned. A grade of Incomplete that isnot removed within this time limitbecomes an F and is computed in theaverage.GRADES Students may obtain their final gradesfor each semester over the telephoneor on the Web by means of a personalidentification number. The parents orguardian of a student who is a minor(under 18 years of age) may, on awritten request to the Office of theUniversity Registrar, obtain the stu-dent's grades at any time. The following symbols indicating grades are used: A, B, C, D, P , F, andW. The following symbol indicates incomplete work: I. Only grades ofA, B, C, D, or F earned while matric-ulated in the College, or earned inany of the College's courses (A/V pre-fixed courses) while matriculated inanother division of New York Uni-versity, are computed in the average.The following grades may be award-ed: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+,D, F. In general, A indicates excellentwork, B indicates good work, C indi-cates satisfactory work, and D indi-cates passable work and is the lowestpassing grade. F indicates failure. Theweights assigned in computing thegrade point average are as follows: A= 4.0, A- = 3.7, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0,B- = 2.7, C+ = 2.3, C = 2.0, C- =1.7, D+ = 1.3, D = 1.0, and F = 0.0. Computing the grade point average: The grade point average can be obtained by determining the totalof all grade points earned (qualitypoints) and dividing that figure bythe total number of credit hours com-pleted (quality hours). For example: A student who has completed 8 points of A (4.0), 4points of B (3.0), and 4 points of C(2.0) has a grade point average of3.25. This is obtained by adding 8(points of A) x 4 (point value of A), 4(points of B) x 3 (point value of B),and 4 (points of C) x 2 (point value ofC), which totals 52 (the total of allgrade points earned), and then bydividing 52 by 16 (the total numberof credit hours completed). This givesthe grade point average of 3.25. Once a final grade has been sub- mitted by the instructor and recordedon the transcript, the final grade can-not be changed by turning in addi-tional course work. To appeal an assigned grade, the student should first consult with theinstructor who assigned the grade todiscuss the grading requirements forthe course and how the grade wasdetermined. If the student is not sat-isfied with the outcome of the discus-sion and wishes to appeal the grade further, a formal written appealshould be submitted to the chairand/or director of undergraduate stud-ies in the particular department. Anindependent review of the grade willbe undertaken by the department. Allof the student's work will be reviewedto clarify how the grade was deter-mined and to ensure the grade is con-sistent the academic guidelines andpolicies of the department. The deci-sion of the department in mattersrelated to a course grade is final. In the case of a course that has been repeated, only the second grade,whether higher or lower, is computedinto the average. The initial grade,however, remains on the transcript. The grades for courses taken abroad in one of New York Universi-ty's programs or at one of theexchange sites are recorded on thetranscript and are also included in thegrade point average. The grades forgraduate and professional coursestaken at other divisions in the Uni-versity are included in the gradepoint average, provided that permis-sion to enroll is obtained prior to reg-istration for the courses. Not included in the undergradu- ate grade point average are grades forthe first year of professional coursestaken by those students in the three-year accelerated dental, law, or med-ical programs; grades for work doneat institutions other than New YorkUniversity (except for exchange sitesabroad); and grades for work done incourses that are not prefixed with anA or a V (non-A/V courses) whileenrolled in another division of NewYork University. P: The grade of P (Pass) indicates a passing grade (A, B, C, or D) in acourse taken under the pass/failoption. It is also used to indicatenongraded courses. The grade of P isnot computed in the average. Thegrade of F under the pass/fail optionis computed in the average. For more information and dures to obtain the pass/fail option,see under \"Pass/Fail Option,\" below. W: The grade of W indicates an official withdrawal of the studentfrom a course. Please see \"Change ofprogram\" and \"Withdrawing fromcourses,\" above, for information onthe regulations and procedures forwithdrawing officially from courses. I: The grade of I (Incomplete) is a temporary grade that indicates that240 ACADEMIC POLICIESthe student has, for good reason, not completed all of the course work butthat there is the possibility that thestudent will eventually pass thecourse when all of the requirementshave been completed. A studentmust ask the instructor for a grade ofI, present documented evidence of ill-ness or the equivalent, and clarify theremaining course requirements withthe instructor. The incomplete grade is not awarded automatically. It is not usedwhen there is no possibility that thestudent will eventually pass thecourse. If the course work is not com-pleted after the statutory time formaking up incompletes has elapsed,the temporary grade of I shall becomean F and will be computed in thestudent's grade point average. INCOMPLETES All work missed in the fall termmust be made up by the end of thefollowing spring term. All workmissed in the spring term or in asummer session must be made up bythe end of the following fall term.Students who are out of attendance inthe semester following the one inwhich the course was taken have oneyear to complete the work. Studentsshould contact the College AdvisingCenter for an Extension of Incom-plete Form, which must be approvedby the instructor. Extensions of thesetime limits are rarely granted. INDEPENDENT STUDY Most departments offer independentstudy courses for students withexceptional qualifications. In thesecourses, the work is planned specifi-cally for each student. Independent study courses allow the student to work independentlywith faculty supervision and counsel.The courses are generally numberedV**.0997, 0998 and typically carryvariable credit of 2 or 4 points eachterm. They are normally limited toupper-class majors but may be opento other well-qualified students. Toregister for independent study, a stu-dent must have written approval ofthe director of undergraduate studies of the department in which thecourse is offered. The result of theindependent study course should be apaper or objective tangible evidenceof completion of the work. The indi-vidual departments may grant creditfor not more than 8 points of inde-pendent study (V**.0997, 0998) forwork approved in advance. In gener-al, students are not permitted to takemore than 12 points of independentstudy and/or internship, and no morethan 8 points may be taken in anyone department. Independent studycourses taken in other divisions of theUniversity or at other universities donot count toward the College degree. More specific information can be found under the individual depart-mental descriptions. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Students who wish to be out of atten-dance from the College for onesemester or an academic year may begranted an official leave of absence.The student should submit a requestto the College Advising Center, Sil-ver Center, Room 905, and have aninterview with an adviser before thebeginning of the term. Leaves are notgranted after the third week of theterm unless there are compelling per-sonal or medical reasons. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal applicationfor readmission as long as he or shereturns to the College within theagreed-upon time (a maximum oftwo semesters). The student on leaveis responsible for financial aid dead-lines. If students are on probationwhen the leave is granted, they willreturn on probation. If they haveattended another college during theleave, they must submit an officialtranscript to the College AdvisingCenter, College of Arts and Science,New York University, Silver Center,100 Washington Square East, Room905, New York, NY 10003-6688.Students out of attendance who didnot apply for a leave and who wish toreturn to the College may apply forreadmission. See under Admission.PASS/FAIL OPTION Students may elect one pass/fail option each term, including the sum-mer sessions, for a total of not morethan 32 points during their collegecareer. The pass/fail option is notacceptable for courses completed atother institutions. The choice must be made before the completion of the fifth week ofthe term (second week of a six-weeksummer session); after that time thedecision cannot be initiated orchanged. No grade other than P or Fwill be recorded for those studentschoosing this option. P includes thegrades of A, B, C, and D and is notcounted in the average. F is countedin the average. The pass/fail option is not accept- able in the major, the minor, or anyof the courses taken in fulfillment ofthe Morse Academic Plan require-ments. Students considering thepass/fail option in their area of studyor in required preprofessional coursesshould consult with their advisersabout the effect of such grades onadmission to graduate and profession-al schools. Students who change theirmajors may not be able to use coursestaken under the pass/fail option tosatisfy the requirements of their newmajors. The form for declaring thepass/fail option may be obtained inthe College Advising Center, SilverCenter, Room 905. PETITIONS The Faculty Committee on Under-graduate Academic Standards willconsider petitions of students towaive requirements or modify poli-cies and regulations of the College.Students should be aware that onlyvery exceptional cases, supported byvalid and documented reasons, willbe considered. After deliberation, theCommittee's decisions on such mat-ters are final. Petition forms may beobtained in the Office of the Associ-ate Dean for Students, Silver Center,Room 909B.ACADEMIC POLICIES 241Placement Examinations, Analysis of Academic Progress, and TranscriptsPLACEMENT EXAMINATIONS I. Foreign Languages. A. Testing and Placement. Most entering students take a profi-ciency/placement test prior to theirfirst registration in the College. SATII-type reading tests are used as profi-ciency (exemption) and placementinstruments in classical Greek,French, German, Italian, and Span-ish. Students who took a foreign lan-guage SAT II test while in highschool are encouraged to present thescore instead of or in addition to tak-ing the College's test. Written exami-nations are also given in Japanese,Mandarin Chinese, Korean, modernGreek, modern Hebrew, Portuguese,Russian, and Tagalog. Testing inCantonese can be arranged throughthe Department of East Asian Stud-ies. Testing in Gaelic (Irish) can bearranged through Ireland House.Testing in Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Hindu, and Urdu can bearranged through the Department ofMiddle Eastern and Islamic Studies.Because these are reading examina-tions, students should choose to betested in the language in which theyhave good reading skills. Tests can result either in an exemption from the foreign-languagerequirement (see \"Foreign Language\"under Morse Academic Plan) or in placement into the appropriate-levelcourse. Placement into a lower-levelcourse means that the student mustcontinue his or her studies of thatlanguage (or begin a new language)until completion of the intermediatelevel of that language. In some cases,adjustments in placement may bemade during the first weeks of class. Information on placement testing can be obtained from Crystal Parsonsat the Office of Academic Affairs, Sil-ver Center, Room 908. Students whoplace at a level below that which theyhave completed at another collegewill lose transfer credit if they repeatcourse work at the College of Artsand Science. B. Testing Exemptions. The proficiency/placement test is requiredof all entering students with the fol-lowing exceptions: students who willbegin a language they have not previ-ously studied; students whose entiresecondary schooling was in a lan-guage other than English and otherthan those languages taught in theCollege; and foreign students who complete the sequence of requiredEnglish courses for international stu-dents. Students in these categoriesshould contact the College AdvisingCenter to verify that they have satis-fied the foreign-language requirement. II. Quantitative Reasoning. All students who are planning to registerfor Quantitative Reasoning(V55.01xx), or to satisfy this MAPrequirement by sufficiently highscore on a test, must take the Quanti-tative Reasoning screening/exemp-tion test. III. Chemistry. A chemistry assessment examination is given toall freshmen who intend to takechemistry. IV . Biology. A biology assess- ment examination is available toentering students to determinewhether they have the qualificationsfor immediate placement into Molec-ular and Cell Biology I and II(V23.0021 and V23.0022).

Academic Standards and DisciplineACADEMIC STANDARDS The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards reviews studentrecords throughout the academicyear. All of its actions are based onthe grades to date at the end of theterm. Academic alert. Students with cumulative grade point averages of2.0 to 2.25 will receive an academicalert letter reflecting the committee'sspecific recommendations for achiev-ing an appropriate standard for acade-mic performance. Academic probation. Any stu- dent whose record is deemed unsatis-factory will be placed on academicprobation and will be so informed byletter. A record will be deemedunsatisfactory if, in any semester, thecumulative or semester grade pointaverage falls below 2.0 or if it fails toshow steady and substantial progresstoward the degree. Steady and sub-stantial progress toward the degreeentails the completion, with satisfac-tory grades, of more than half of thecourses (and points) for which a stu-dent registers in any semester. Inaddition, it entails satisfactoryprogress in the student's major. Failure to satisfy the conditions of probation will result in further acade-mic sanctions and possibly dismissalfrom the College. The conditionsusually require that the student (a)achieve a grade point average of atleast 2.0 during the term he or she ison probation, (b) not receive anygrade below a C or any grade of I,and (c) not withdraw from any coursewithout securing the permission ofthe Committee on UndergraduateAcademic Standards prior to thewithdrawal. Students on academicprobation are also required to have a special probation interview with anadviser in the College Advising Cen-ter in order to receive registrationclearance for the next semester. Morespecific requirements may beimposed. The Committee on Undergradu- ate Academic Standards may sum-mon students with unsatisfactoryrecords to discuss their problems andto determine whether and underwhat conditions they may continuein the College. In special circum-stances, the committee may recom-mend to the dean that students maybe granted or placed on leave for aperiod not to exceed two semesters. Students on academic probation may not engage in any extracurricularactivities (except for departmentalclubs) and may not hold office inthese clubs without the approval ofthe Committee on UndergraduateAcademic Standards. Students on academic probation should be aware that they are usuallyineligible for financial aid. Academic dismissal. Students who are dismissed from the Collegefor poor academic performance areinformed in writing by registeredmail. Students who have paid tuitionfor the next term at the time of dis-missal will receive a full refund oftuition and fees. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Community of the MindThe College is a \"community of themind.\" Its students, faculty, and staffall share the goal of pursuing truththrough free and open inquiry, andwe support one another's endeavors inthis regard. As in any community,membership comes with certain rights and responsibilities. Foremostamong these is academic integrity.Cheating on an exam, falsifying data,or having someone else write a paperundermines others who are \"doing iton their own\"; it makes it difficult orimpossible to assess fairly a student'sinterest, aptitude, and achievement;and it diminishes the cheater, depriv-ing him or her of an education. Mostimportant, academic dishonesty is aviolation of the very principles uponwhich the academy is founded. Thus,when students enter the College, oneof the first things that they are askedto do is to sign a community com-pact, recognizing these principles ofacademic integrity. For this reasonalso, violations of these principles aretreated with the utmost seriousness. Procedures and Sanctions The penalty for academic dishonestyis severe. The following are the proce-dures as approved by the Faculty ofArts and Science. 1. If a student cheats on an exam- ination or in laboratory work orengages in plagiarism, appropriatedisciplinary action should be taken.The department can take the follow-ing actions: a) The faculty member, with the approval of the director of undergrad-uate studies (director), may reducethe student's grade or give the stu-dent an F in the course. b) If after lowering the grade or assigning an F the departmentbelieves a more severe penalty (i.e.,probation, suspension, expulsion) iswarranted, it can refer the case to thedean or his or her representative(associate dean for students) for fur-ther action.ARREARS POLICY The University reserves the right todeny registration and withhold allinformation regarding the record ofany student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, orother charges (including charges forhousing, dining, or other activities orservices) for as long as any arrears remain.ACADEMIC POLICIES 2432. In all cases of either (a) or (b), the director shall inform the depart-ment chair of any action in writingand send copies of this letter to thedean and to the student. The lettershall include the nature of theoffense, the penalty, and the right ofthe student to appeal such penalty. Acopy of the letter shall be kept in aconfidential chairman's file and not inthe student's departmental file. Thedean's office copy shall also be kept ina confidential file. (The professorand/or the director is encouraged tomeet with the student and discussthe nature of the offense and theaction taken.) 3. For cases involving a first offense at New York University, thedean shall send the student by regis-tered mail a notice that a secondoffense will result in a one-semestersuspension or a more severe penalty.(The student is also called in to dis-cuss the offense and review the conse-quences of the disciplinary action.) 4. For cases involving a second offense, the dean shall proceed as fol-lows: a) Upon receiving a second direc- tor's letter concerning a given stu-dent, the dean shall convene a three-member ad hoc committee, with nomember being from the departmentinvolved, to examine the evidence.This ad hoc committee shall considerif there are reasonable grounds tobelieve that cheating/ plagiarism hasoccurred and if so, shall affirm thesuspension penalty. It shall report itsconclusion to the dean within threebusiness days. b) If the committee affirms the suspension, the dean shall send thestudent by registered mail the sus-pension letter within two businessdays of receiving the report. The let-ter shall advise the student of his orher right to appeal. The student shallhave two business days from the let-ter's delivery to request an appeal ofthe suspension as provided in Section5 (below). The suspension shall ordi-narily be stayed during the pendency of appeal. c) If the committee does not affirm the suspension, the report shallbe kept on file for a one-year period. 5. The student in all cases has the right to appeal to the dean. In theevent of an appeal, the dean shallelicit a written complaint from thefaculty member and proceed asdescribed above. DISCIPLINE Students are expected to familiarizethemselves and to comply with therules of conduct, regulations, andestablished practices of the Universityand the College of Arts and Science,as stated in the Student Discipline Rules and Procedures of the College of Arts andScience and as outlined in the chapter \"University and Student Governance,Policies, and Procedures\" in the NYU Student Guide.
