All manuscript submissions should follow the general manuscript guidelines, in addition to the guidelines specific to a type of paper. Manuscript Submission Manuscript Submission Submission of a manuscript implies: that the work described has not been published before; that it is not under consideration for publication anywhere else; that its publication has been approved by all co-authors, if any, as well as by the responsible authorities - tacitly or explicitly - at the institute where the work has been carried out. The publisher will not be held legally responsible should there be any claims for compensation. Permissions Authors wishing to include figures, tables, or text passages that have already been published elsewhere are required to obtain permission from the copyright owner(s) for both the print and online format and to include evidence that such permission has been granted when submitting their papers. Any material received without such evidence will be assumed to originate from the authors. Online Submission Please follow the hyperlink \"Submit manuscript\" and upload all of your manuscript files following the instructions given on the screen. Source Files Please ensure you provide all relevant editable source files at every submission and revision. Failing to submit a complete set of editable source files will result in your article not being considered for review. For your manuscript text please always submit in common word processing formats such as .docx or LaTeX. Manuscripts - Type manuscript in English, double-spaced on con\u00acsec\u00acu\u00actively numbered pages with 1- to 1.5-in. margins. - The level of English in manuscripts must be of a standard suitable for publication. Manuscripts not having an acceptable level of English will not be reviewed. Authors who do not have English as their first language are therefore requested to consider seeking help from a native English speaker in preparing their manuscript. Abstracts Abstracts should be 100-200 words. Index Entries Include 5-10 index entries/key words. Artwork and Illustrations Guidelines Electronic Figure Submission - Supply all figures electronically. - Indicate what graphics program was used to create the artwork. - For vector graphics, the preferred format is EPS; for halftones, please use TIFF format. MSOffice files are also acceptable. - Vector graphics containing fonts must have the fonts embedded in the files. - Name your figure files with \"Fig\" and the figure number, e.g., Fig1.eps. Line Art - Definition: Black and white graphic with no shading. - Do not use faint lines and/or lettering and check that all lines and lettering within the figures are legible at final size. - All lines should be at least 0.1 mm (0.3 pt) wide. - Scanned line drawings and line drawings in bitmap format should have a minimum resolution of 1200 dpi. - Vector graphics containing fonts must have the fonts embedded in the files. Halftone Art - Definition: Photographs, drawings, or paintings with fine shading, etc. - If any magnification is used in the photographs, indicate this by using scale bars within the figures themselves. - Halftones should have a minimum resolution of 300 dpi. Combination Art - Definition: a combination of halftone and line art, e.g., halftones containing line drawing, extensive lettering, color diagrams, etc. - Combination artwork should have a minimum resolution of 600 dpi. Color Art - Color art is free of charge for online publication. - If black and white will be shown in the print version, make sure that the main information will still be visible. Many colors are not distinguishable from one another when converted to black and white. A simple way to check this is to make a xerographic copy to see if the necessary distinctions between the different colors are still apparent. - If the figures will be printed in black and white, do not refer to color in the captions. - Color illustrations should be submitted as RGB (8 bits per channel). Figure Lettering - To add lettering, it is best to use Helvetica or Arial (sans serif fonts). - Keep lettering consistently sized throughout your final-sized artwork, usually about 2-3 mm (8-12 pt). - Variance of type size within an illustration should be minimal, e.g., do not use 8-pt type on an axis and 20-pt type for the axis label. - Avoid effects such as shading, outline letters, etc. - Do not include titles or captions within your illustrations. Figure Numbering - All figures are to be numbered using Arabic numerals. - Figures should always be cited in text in consecutive numerical order. - Figure parts should be denoted by lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.). - If an appendix appears in your article and it contains one or more figures, continue the consecutive numbering of the main text. Do not number the appendix figures,\"A1, [Supplementary Information (SI)] should, however, be numbered separately. Figure Captions - Each figure should have a concise caption describing accurately what the figure depicts. Include the captions in the text file of the manuscript, not in the figure file. - Figure captions begin with the term Fig. in bold type, followed by the figure number, also in bold type. - No punctuation is to be included after the number, nor is any punctuation to be placed at the end of the caption. - Identify all elements found in the figure in the figure caption; and use boxes, circles, etc., as coordinate points in graphs. - Identify previously published material by giving the original source in the form of a reference citation at the end of the figure caption. Figure Placement and Size - Figures should be submitted within the body of the text. Only if the file size of the manuscript causes problems in uploading it, the large figures should be submitted separately from the text. - When preparing your figures, size figures to fit in the column width. - For large-sized journals the figures should be 84 mm (for double-column text areas), or 174 mm (for single-column text areas) wide and not higher than 234 mm. - For small-sized journals, the figures should be 119 mm wide and not higher than 195 mm. Permissions If you include figures that have already been published elsewhere, you must obtain permission from the copyright owner(s) for both the print and online format. Please be aware that some publishers do not grant electronic rights for free and that Springer will not be able to refund any costs that may have occurred to receive these permissions. In such cases, material from other sources should be used. Accessibility In order to give people of all abilities and disabilities access to the content of your figures, please make sure that - All figures have descriptive captions (blind users could then use a text-to-speech software or a text-to-Braille hardware) - Patterns are used instead of or in addition to colors for conveying information (colorblind users would then be able to distinguish the visual elements) - Any figure lettering has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 Nomenclature Authors should follow the recommendations of the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature. All abbreviations should be fully defined in the text. Tables Type on separate pages. Number consecutively with Arabic numerals in ord\u00acer of mention in the text. All Tables must be cited sequentially in text. Provide titles for all tables. Supplementary Information (SI) Springer accepts electronic multimedia files (animations, movies, audio, etc.) and other supplementary files to be published online along with an article or a book chapter. This feature can add dimension to the author's article, as certain information cannot be printed or is more convenient in electronic form. Before submitting research datasets as Supplementary Information, authors should read the journal's Research data policy. We encourage research data to be archived in data repositories wherever possible. Submission - Supply all supplementary material in standard file formats. - Please include in each file the following information: article title, journal name, author names; affiliation and e-mail address of the corresponding author. - To accommodate user downloads, please keep in mind that larger-sized files may require very long download times and that some users may experience other problems during downloading. - High resolution (streamable quality) videos can be submitted up to a maximum of 25GB; low resolution videos should not be larger than 5GB. Audio, Video, and Animations - Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 4:3 - Maximum file size: 25 GB for high resolution files; 5 GB for low resolution files - Minimum video duration: 1 sec - Supported file formats: Presentations - Submit your material in PDF format; .doc or .ppt files are not suitable for long-term viability. - A collection of figures may also be combined in a PDF file. Spreadsheets - Spreadsheets should be submitted as .csv or .xlsx files (MS Excel). Specialized Formats - Specialized format such as .pdb (chemical), .wrl (VRML), .nb (Mathematica notebook), and .tex can also be supplied. Collecting Multiple Files - It is possible to collect multiple files in a .zip or .gz file. Numbering - If supplying any supplementary material, the text must make specific mention of the material as a citation, similar to that of figures and tables. - Refer to the supplementary files as \"Online Resource\", e.g., \"... as shown in the animation (Online Resource 3)\", \"... additional data are given in Online Resource 4\". - Name the files consecutively, e.g. \"ESM_3.mpg\", \"ESM_4.pdf\". Captions - For each supplementary material, please supply a concise caption describing the content of the file. Processing of supplementary files - Supplementary Information (SI) will be published as received from the author without any conversion, editing, or reformatting. Accessibility In order to give people of all abilities and disabilities access to the content of your supplementary files, please make sure that - The manuscript contains a descriptive caption for each supplementary material - Video files do not contain anything that flashes more than three times per second (so that users prone to seizures caused by such effects are not put at risk) References Cite in the text by bold italic Arabic numerals in parentheses, set on the text line, numbered in the order they appear.

Presenting your work in a well-structured manuscript and in well-written English gives it its best chance for editors and reviewers to understand it and evaluate it fairly. Many researchers find that getting some independent support helps them present their results in the best possible light. The experts at Springer Nature Author Services can help you with manuscript preparation\u2014including English language editing, developmental comments, manuscript formatting, figure preparation, translation, and more. You can also use our free [Grammar Check](https://www.aje.com/grammar-check/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Springer&utm_campaign=SNAS+Referrals+2022+GC&utm_id=Grammar+Check) tool for an evaluation of your work. Please note that using these tools, or any other service, is not a requirement for publication, nor does it imply or guarantee that editors will accept the article, or even select it for peer review.

Ethical Responsibilities of Authors This journal is committed to upholding the integrity of the scientific record. As a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics ( [COPE](https://publicationethics.org/about/our-organisation)) the journal will follow the [COPE](https://publicationethics.org/about/our-organisation) guidelines on how to deal with potential acts of misconduct. Authors should refrain from misrepresenting research results which could damage the trust in the journal, the professionalism of scientific authorship, and ultimately the entire scientific endeavour. Maintaining integrity of the research and its presentation is helped by following the rules of good scientific practice, which include*: - The manuscript should not be submitted to more than one journal for simultaneous consideration. - The submitted work should be original and should not have been published elsewhere in any form or language (partially or in full), unless the new work concerns an expansion of previous work. (Please provide transparency on the re-use of material to avoid the concerns about text-recycling ('self-plagiarism'). - A single study should not be split up into several parts to increase the quantity of submissions and submitted to various journals or to one journal over time (i.e. 'salami-slicing/publishing'). - Concurrent or secondary publication is sometimes justifiable, provided certain conditions are met. Examples include: translations or a manuscript that is intended for a different group of readers. - Results should be presented clearly, honestly, and without fabrication, falsification or inappropriate data manipulation (including image based manipulation). Authors should adhere to discipline-specific rules for acquiring, selecting and processing data. - No data, text, or theories by others are presented as if they were the author's own ('plagiarism'). Proper acknowledgements to other works must be given (this includes material that is closely copied (near verbatim), summarized and/or paraphrased), quotation marks (to indicate words taken from another source) are used for verbatim copying of material, and permissions secured for material that is copyrighted. Important note: the journal may use software to screen for plagiarism. - Authors should make sure they have permissions for the use of software, questionnaires/(web) surveys and scales in their studies (if appropriate). - Research articles and non-research articles (e.g. Opinion, Review, and Commentary articles) must cite appropriate and relevant literature in support of the claims made. Excessive and inappropriate self-citation or coordinated efforts among several authors to collectively self-cite is strongly discouraged. - Authors should avoid untrue statements about an entity (who can be an individual person or a company) or descriptions of their behavior or actions that could potentially be seen as personal attacks or allegations about that person. - Research that may be misapplied to pose a threat to public health or national security should be clearly identified in the manuscript (e.g. dual use of research). Examples include creation of harmful consequences of biological agents or toxins, disruption of immunity of vaccines, unusual hazards in the use of chemicals, weaponization of research/technology (amongst others). - Authors are strongly advised to ensure the author group, the Corresponding Author, and the order of authors are all correct at submission. Adding and/or deleting authors during the revision stages is generally not permitted, but in some cases may be warranted. Reasons for changes in authorship should be explained in detail. Please note that changes to authorship cannot be made after acceptance of a manuscript. *All of the above are guidelines and authors need to make sure to respect third parties rights such as copyright and/or moral rights. Upon request authors should be prepared to send relevant documentation or data in order to verify the validity of the results presented. This could be in the form of raw data, samples, records, etc. Sensitive information in the form of confidential or proprietary data is excluded. If there is suspicion of misbehavior or alleged fraud the Journal and/or Publisher will carry out an investigation following [COPE](https://publicationethics.org/about/our-organisation) guidelines. If, after investigation, there are valid concerns, the author(s) concerned will be contacted under their given e-mail address and given an opportunity to address the issue. Depending on the situation, this may result in the Journal's and/or Publisher's implementation of the following measures, including, but not limited to: - If the manuscript is still under consideration, it may be rejected and returned to the author. - If the article has already been published online, depending on the nature and severity of the infraction: - an erratum/correction may be placed with the article - an expression of concern may be placed with the article - or in severe cases retraction of the article may occur. The reason will be given in the published erratum/correction, expression of concern or retraction note. Please note that retraction means that the article is maintained on the platform, watermarked \"retracted\" and the explanation for the retraction is provided in a note linked to the watermarked article. - The author's institution may be informed - A notice of suspected transgression of ethical standards in the peer review system may be included as part of the author's and article's bibliographic record. Fundamental errors Authors have an obligation to correct mistakes once they discover a significant error or inaccuracy in their published article. The author(s) is/are requested to contact the journal and explain in what sense the error is impacting the article. A decision on how to correct the literature will depend on the nature of the error. This may be a correction or retraction. The retraction note should provide transparency which parts of the article are impacted by the error. Suggesting / excluding reviewers Authors are welcome to suggest suitable reviewers and/or request the exclusion of certain individuals when they submit their manuscripts. When suggesting reviewers, authors should make sure they are totally independent and not connected to the work in any way. It is strongly recommended to suggest a mix of reviewers from different countries and different institutions. When suggesting reviewers, the Corresponding Author must provide an institutional email address for each suggested reviewer, or, if this is not possible to include other means of verifying the identity such as a link to a personal homepage, a link to the publication record or a researcher or author ID in the submission letter. Please note that the Journal may not use the suggestions, but suggestions are appreciated and may help facilitate the peer review process. Authorship principles These guidelines describe authorship principles and good authorship practices to which prospective authors should adhere to. Authorship clarified The Journal and Publisher assume all authors agreed with the content and that all gave explicit consent to submit and that they obtained consent from the responsible authorities at the institute/organization where the work has been carried out, before the work is submitted. The Publisher does not prescribe the kinds of contributions that warrant authorship. It is recommended that authors adhere to the guidelines for authorship that are applicable in their specific research field. In absence of specific guidelines it is recommended to adhere to the following guidelines*: All authors whose names appear on the submission 1) made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data; or the creation of new software used in the work; 2) drafted the work or revised it critically for important intellectual content; 3) approved the version to be published; and 4) agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. * Based on/adapted from: [ICMJE, Defining the Role of Authors and Contributors, ](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) [Transparency in authors' contributions and responsibilities to promote integrity in scientific publication, McNutt at all, PNAS February 27, 2018 ](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1715374115) Disclosures and declarations All authors are requested to include information regarding sources of funding, financial or non-financial interests, study-specific approval by the appropriate ethics committee for research involving humans and/or animals, informed consent if the research involved human participants, and a statement on welfare of animals if the research involved animals (as appropriate). The decision whether such information should be included is not only dependent on the scope of the journal, but also the scope of the article. Work submitted for publication may have implications for public health or general welfare and in those cases it is the responsibility of all authors to include the appropriate disclosures and declarations. Data transparency All authors are requested to make sure that all data and materials as well as software application or custom code support their published claims and comply with field standards. Please note that journals may have individual policies on (sharing) research data in concordance with disciplinary norms and expectations. Role of the Corresponding Author One author is assigned as Corresponding Author and acts on behalf of all co-authors and ensures that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately addressed. The Corresponding Author is responsible for the following requirements: - ensuring that all listed authors have approved the manuscript before submission, including the names and order of authors; - managing all communication between the Journal and all co-authors, before and after publication;* - providing transparency on re-use of material and mention any unpublished material (for example manuscripts in press) included in the manuscript in a cover letter to the Editor; - making sure disclosures, declarations and transparency on data statements from all authors are included in the manuscript as appropriate (see above). * The requirement of managing all communication between the journal and all co-authors during submission and proofing may be delegated to a Contact or Submitting Author. In this case please make sure the Corresponding Author is clearly indicated in the manuscript. Author contributions In absence of specific instructions and in research fields where it is possible to describe discrete efforts, the Publisher recommends authors to include contribution statements in the work that specifies the contribution of every author in order to promote transparency. These contributions should be listed at the separate title page. Examples of such statement(s) are shown below: Free text: All authors contributed to the study conception and design. Material preparation, data collection and analysis were performed by [full name], [full name] and [full name]. The first draft of the manuscript was written by [full name] and all authors commented on previous versions of the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript. Conceptualization: [full name], ...; Writing - original draft preparation: ...]; Writing - For review articles where discrete statements are less applicable a statement should be included who had the idea for the article, who performed the literature search and data analysis, and who drafted and/or critically revised the work. For articles that are based primarily on the student's dissertation or thesis, it is recommended that the student is usually listed as principal author: [A Graduate Student's Guide to Determining Authorship Credit and Authorship Order, APA Science Student Council 2006 ](https://www.apa.org/science/leadership/students/authorship-paper.pdf) Affiliation The primary affiliation for each author should be the institution where the majority of their work was done. If an author has subsequently moved, the current address may additionally be stated. Addresses will not be updated or changed after publication of the article. Changes to authorship Authors are strongly advised to ensure the correct author group, the Corresponding Author, and the order of authors at submission. Changes of authorship by adding or deleting authors, and/or changes in Corresponding Author, and/or changes in the sequence of authors are not accepted after acceptance of a manuscript. - Please note that author names will be published exactly as they appear on the accepted submission! Please make sure that the names of all authors are present and correctly spelled, and that addresses and affiliations are current. Adding and/or deleting authors at revision stage are generally not permitted, but in some cases it may be warranted. Reasons for these changes in authorship should be explained. Approval of the change during revision is at the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief. Please note that journals may have individual policies on adding and/or deleting authors during revision stage. Author identification Authors are recommended to use their [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) ID when submitting an article for consideration or acquire an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) ID via the submission process. Deceased or incapacitated authors For cases in which a co-author dies or is incapacitated during the writing, submission, or peer-review process, and the co-authors feel it is appropriate to include the author, co-authors should obtain approval from a (legal) representative which could be a direct relative. Authorship issues or disputes In the case of an authorship dispute during peer review or after acceptance and publication, the Journal will not be in a position to investigate or adjudicate. Authors will be asked to resolve the dispute themselves. If they are unable the Journal reserves the right to withdraw a manuscript from the editorial process or in case of a published paper raise the issue with the authors' institution(s) and abide by its guidelines. Confidentiality Authors should treat all communication with the Journal as confidential which includes correspondence with direct representatives from the Journal such as Editors-in-Chief and/or Handling Editors and reviewers' reports unless explicit consent has been received to share information. Compliance with Ethical Standards To ensure objectivity and transparency in research and to ensure that accepted principles of ethical and professional conduct have been followed, authors should include information regarding sources of funding, potential conflicts of interest (financial or non-financial), informed consent if the research involved human participants, and a statement on welfare of animals if the research involved animals. Authors should include the following statements (if applicable) in a separate section entitled \"Compliance with Ethical Standards\" when submitting a paper: - Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest - Research involving Human Participants and/or Animals - Informed consent Please note that standards could vary slightly per journal dependent on their peer review policies (i.e. single or double blind peer review) as well as per journal subject discipline. Before submitting your article check the instructions following this section carefully. The corresponding author should be prepared to collect documentation of compliance with ethical standards and send if requested during peer review or after publication. The Editors reserve the right to reject manuscripts that do not comply with the above-mentioned guidelines. The author will be held responsible for false statements or failure to fulfill the above-mentioned guidelines. Research involving human participants, their data or biological material Ethics approval When reporting a study that involved human participants, their data or biological material, authors should include a statement that confirms that the study was approved (or granted exemption) by the appropriate institutional and/or national research ethics committee (including the name of the ethics committee) and certify that the study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the [1964 Declaration of Helsinki](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/) and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. If doubt exists whether the research was conducted in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration or comparable standards, the authors must explain the reasons for their approach, and demonstrate that an independent ethics committee or institutional review board explicitly approved the doubtful aspects of the study. If a study was granted exemption from requiring ethics approval, this should also be detailed in the manuscript (including the reasons for the exemption). Retrospective ethics approval If a study has not been granted ethics committee approval prior to commencing, retrospective ethics approval usually cannot be obtained and it may not be possible to consider the manuscript for peer review. The decision on whether to proceed to peer review in such cases is at the Editor's discretion. Ethics approval for retrospective studies Although retrospective studies are conducted on already available data or biological material (for which formal consent may not be needed or is difficult to obtain) ethics approval may be required dependent on the law and the national ethical guidelines of a country. Authors should check with their institution to make sure they are complying with the specific requirements of their country. Ethics approval for case studies Case reports require ethics approval. Most institutions will have specific policies on this subject. Authors should check with their institution to make sure they are complying with the specific requirements of their institution and seek ethics approval where needed. Authors should be aware to secure informed consent from the individual (or parent or guardian if the participant is a minor or incapable) See also section on Informed Consent. Cell lines If human cells are used, authors must declare in the manuscript: what cell lines were used by describing the source of the cell line, including when and from where it was obtained, whether the cell line has recently been authenticated and by what method. If cells were bought from a life science company the following need to be given in the manuscript: name of company (that provided the cells), cell type, number of cell line, and batch of cells. It is recommended that authors check the [NCBI database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/?term=cell%20line%20status%20misidentified%5bAttribute%5d) for misidentification and contamination of human cell lines. This step will alert authors to possible problems with the cell line and may save considerable time and effort. Further information is available from the [International Cell Line Authentication Committee](http://iclac.org/about-iclac/) (ICLAC). Authors should include a statement that confirms that an institutional or independent ethics committee (including the name of the ethics committee) approved the study and that informed consent was obtained from the donor or next of kin. Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) are persistent unique identifiers (effectively similar to a DOI) for research resources. This journal encourages authors to adopt RRIDs when reporting key biological resources (antibodies, cell lines, model organisms and tools) in their manuscripts. Examples: Organism: the [Resource Identification Portal](https://scicrunch.org/resources). Many commonly used research resources already have designated RRIDs. The portal also provides authors links so that they can quickly [register a new resource](https://scicrunch.org/resources/about/resource) and obtain an RRID. Clinical Trial Registration The World Health Organization (WHO) definition of a clinical trial is \"any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes\". The WHO defines health interventions as \"A health intervention is an act performed for, with or on behalf of a person or population whose purpose is to assess, improve, maintain, promote or modify health, functioning or health conditions\" and a health-related outcome is generally defined as a change in the health of a person or population as a result of an intervention. To ensure the integrity of the reporting of patient-centered trials, authors must register prospective clinical trials (phase II to IV trials) in suitable publicly available repositories. For example [www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) or any of the primary registries that participate in the [WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform](https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform). The trial registration number (TRN) and date of registration should be included as the last line of the manuscript abstract. For clinical trials that have not been registered prospectively, authors are encouraged to register retrospectively to ensure the complete publication of all results. The trial registration number (TRN), date of registration and the words 'retrospectively registered' should be included as the last line of the manuscript abstract. Standards of reporting Springer Nature advocates complete and transparent reporting of biomedical and biological research and research with biological applications. Authors are recommended to adhere to the minimum reporting guidelines hosted by the [EQUATOR Network](http://www.equator-network.org/) when preparing their manuscript.

Examples of statements to be used when ethics approval has been obtained: All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of A (No. ...). This study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of University B (Date.../No. ...). Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of University C. The procedures used in this study adhere to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The questionnaire and methodology for this study was approved by the Human Research Ethics committee of the University of D (Ethics approval number: ...). Examples of statements to be used for a retrospective study: Ethical approval was waived by the local Ethics Committee of University A in view of the retrospective nature of the study and all the procedures being performed were part of the routine care. This research study was conducted retrospectively from data obtained for clinical purposes. We consulted extensively with the IRB of XYZ who determined that our study did not need ethical approval. An IRB official waiver of ethical approval was granted from the IRB of XYZ. This retrospective chart review study involving human participants was in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The Human Investigation Committee (IRB) of University B approved this study. Examples of statements to be used when no ethical approval is required/exemption granted: This is an observational study. The XYZ Research Ethics Committee has confirmed that no ethical approval is required. The data reproduced from Article X utilized human tissue that was procured via our Biobank AB, which provides de-identified samples. This study was reviewed and deemed exempt by our XYZ Institutional Review Board. The BioBank protocols are in accordance with the ethical standards of our institution and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Authors are responsible for correctness of the statements provided in the manuscript. See also Authorship Principles. The Editor-in-Chief reserves the right to reject submissions that do not meet the guidelines described in this section. Informed consent All individuals have individual rights that are not to be infringed. Individual participants in studies have, for example, the right to decide what happens to the (identifiable) personal data gathered, to what they have said during a study or an interview, as well as to any photograph that was taken. This is especially true concerning images of vulnerable people (e.g. minors, patients, refugees, etc) or the use of images in sensitive contexts. In many instances authors will need to secure written consent before including images. Identifying details (names, dates of birth, identity numbers, biometrical characteristics (such as facial features, fingerprint, writing style, voice pattern, DNA or other distinguishing characteristic) and other information) of the participants that were studied should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, and genetic profiles unless the information is essential for scholarly purposes and the participant (or parent/guardian if the participant is a minor or incapable or legal representative) gave written informed consent for publication. Complete anonymity is difficult to achieve in some cases. Detailed descriptions of individual participants, whether of their whole bodies or of body sections, may lead to disclosure of their identity. Under certain circumstances consent is not required as long as information is anonymized and the submission does not include images that may identify the person. Informed consent for publication should be obtained if there is any doubt. For example, masking the eye region in photographs of participants is inadequate protection of anonymity. If identifying characteristics are altered to protect anonymity, such as in genetic profiles, authors should provide assurance that alterations do not distort meaning. Exceptions where it is not necessary to obtain consent: Images such as x rays, laparoscopic images, ultrasound images, brain scans, pathology slides unless there is a concern about identifying information in which case, authors should ensure that consent is obtained. Reuse of images: If images are being reused from prior publications, the Publisher will assume that the prior publication obtained the relevant information regarding consent. Authors should provide the appropriate attribution for republished images. Consent and already available data and/or biologic material Regardless of whether material is collected from living or dead patients, they (family or guardian if the deceased has not made a pre-mortem decision) must have given prior written consent. The aspect of confidentiality as well as any wishes from the deceased should be respected. Data protection, confidentiality and privacy When biological material is donated for or data is generated as part of a research project authors should ensure, as part of the informed consent procedure, that the participants are made aware what kind of (personal) data will be processed, how it will be used and for what purpose. In case of data acquired via a biobank/biorepository, it is possible they apply a broad consent which allows research participants to consent to a broad range of uses of their data and samples which is regarded by research ethics committees as specific enough to be considered \"informed\". However, authors should always check the specific biobank/biorepository policies or any other type of data provider policies (in case of non-bio research) to be sure that this is the case. Consent to Participate For all research involving human subjects, freely-given, informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from participants (or their parent or legal guardian in the case of children under 16) and a statement to this effect should appear in the manuscript. In the case of articles describing human transplantation studies, authors must include a statement declaring that no organs/tissues were obtained from prisoners and must also name the institution(s)/clinic(s)/department(s) via which organs/tissues were obtained. For manuscripts reporting studies involving vulnerable groups where there is the potential for coercion or where consent may not have been fully informed, extra care will be taken by the editor and may be referred to the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group. Consent to Publish Individuals may consent to participate in a study, but object to having their data published in a journal article. Authors should make sure to also seek consent from individuals to publish their data prior to submitting their paper to a journal. This is in particular applicable to case studies. A consent to publish form can be found Summary of requirements The above should be summarized in a statement and placed in a 'Declarations' section before the reference list under a heading of 'Consent to participate' and/or 'Consent to publish'. Other declarations include Funding, Competing interests, Ethics approval, Consent, Data and/or Code availability and Authors' contribution statements. Please see the various examples of wording below and revise/customize the sample statements according to your own needs. Sample statements for \"Consent to participate\": Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Informed consent was obtained from legal guardians. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents. Verbal informed consent was obtained prior to the interview. Sample statements for \"Consent to publish\": The authors affirm that human research participants provided informed consent for publication of the images in Figure(s) 1a, 1b and 1c. The participant has consented to the submission of the case report to the journal. Patients signed informed consent regarding publishing their data and photographs. Sample statements if identifying information about participants is available in the article: Additional informed consent was obtained from all individual participants for whom identifying information is included in this article. Authors are responsible for correctness of the statements provided in the manuscript. See also Authorship Principles. The Editor-in-Chief reserves the right to reject submissions that do not meet the guidelines described in this section. Images will be removed from publication if authors have not obtained informed consent or the paper may be removed and replaced with a notice explaining the reason for removal.
