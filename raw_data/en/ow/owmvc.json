These medicines are manufactured according to strict FDA and anthroposophic pharmacy standards. Successfu! cancer treatment often requires a re- integration of the \"whole\" organism and the strengthening of \"self\" regulation and integration within body, soul and spirit. This means learning to treat patients individually and applying adjuvant medications and therapies synergistically. ln this booklet, you will find many suggestions for cancer treatment and commonly related symptoms. This booklet is a guide only and is not meant to train clinicians or represent the full practice of Anthroposophic Medicine. Many of these therapies are discussed in a respected anthroposophic medicine textbook called \"lnternal Medicine\" by Dr. Matthias Girke (available at www.paam.net and published by salumed verlag). Other suggestions come from clinicians experienced with treating oncology patients according to both anthroposophic and conventional practice of medicine. ln some cases, our experienced editor has taken the liberty to suggest a Uriel remedy which is compounded similarly to medications only available in Europe. ln some cases, a direct recommendation to other manufactures is made where the remedies are not available at Uriel pharmacy. *Please note that when dosage recommendations are given for ampules at L to 2 times daily or pellets 3 to 5 times daily This is for acute processes. Usually these more intense dosing schedules are for l to 2weeks and then evaluated to see if lower dosing can suffice. Pellets and drops are always given at least 15 minutes away from food and before meals is best. lnjections should be given at least an hour away from any other significant biological or immunotherapies. * Most Uriel remedies will not interact with other conventional and natural remedies. For non-homoeopathic remedies consider taking an hour away from prescription medications. Always consult your primary clinician when taking new and multiple medications. * Remedies can be used by any clinician. The indications for remedies can be symptom based to some degree. However, they are also meant to treat the deeper layers of the body, soul and spirit connected with salutogenic forces of health which work to overcome the processes of disease. The basic three-fold and four-fold paradigm of the human being are listed below and are often used to more specifically direct the intention of our treatments towards supporting the life processes of the \"whole\" human being. This supports self-healing and salutogenesis. To learn more about training visit the Physicians Association for Anthroposophic Medicine at www.paam.net.

Specific Tumor Metastasis ln anthroposophic medicine tumor metastasis is also seen in a three-folding principle of action. Specific remedies can be given to support the organism for specific regions of metastasis and the ensuing disturbances and symptoms. The goal of anthroposophic therapy in metastasis is to support the formative principles stemming from the upper pole of the human being. This requires a healthy and rhythmic balance between the nerve-sense and metabolic regions of the human being (see diagram at beginning of booklet). Cerebral Metastasis: rne nervaus system has both an anabolic and catobolic functian. ln patients who ore pale and weak with poor appetite likely needs argenturn whereas a robust patient with gaod appetite and strong etheric (reqenerative) quality likely needs drops given 1-0 drops TID-QlD.

Argentum Quartz ampules and pellets: may be substituted in the same fashion if the silica therapy is justified.
