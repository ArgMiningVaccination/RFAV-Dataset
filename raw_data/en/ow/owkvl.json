In the 6-month trial, 21 deaths occurred in the mRNA vaccine group and 17 in the placebo group. If vaccines save lives, we should expect the all-cause mortality rate \u2014 death from all causes \u2014 to be lower in the vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group. But if the all-cause mortality rate is equal in both groups, it could mean that the vaccine doesn't save lives \u2014 either because the vaccine doesn't work or the vaccine kills as many people as it saves. If the all-cause mortality is higher in the vaccine group, then it's a danger signal. To state this article's conclusion early, yes, no reduction in all-cause mortality rate was seen in the mRNA vaccine group in Pfizer's 6-month clinical trial. But there are reasons for this; for example, very few participants are at high risk of fatal Covid-19, making this trial unsuitable for studying mortality rate. Other observational studies on Covid-19 vaccines and all-cause mortality show otherwise. No changes in all-cause mortality rate in the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine actually doesn't find a net benefit in the all-cause mortality rate between the mRNA vaccine (vaccine only from now on) and the placebo (saline injection) group. As stated in their Biologics Licence Application [(BLA) report](https://www.fda.gov/media/151733/download) (page 23), which was submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to apply for vaccine approval, in November 2021: \"From Dose 1 [started on July 27, 2020] through the March 13, 2021 data cutoff date, there were a total of 38 deaths, 21 in the COMIRNATY [Pfizer's mRNA vaccine] group and 17 in the placebo group. None of the deaths were considered related to vaccination.\" So, there were 21 and 17 deaths \u2014 including Covid deaths \u2014 in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively. The vaccine group has 21,047 and the placebo group has 20,794 participants, making the all-cause mortality rate at about 0.0998% in the vaccine and 0.0817% in the placebo group. "}
