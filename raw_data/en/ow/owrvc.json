Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use the messenger RNA (mRNA) manufacturing platform. mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccines contain the genetic instructions for making the COVID-19 spike protein. This protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions like a recipe and produce the spike protein. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them. The cell then displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune system recognizes that the protein doesn't belong there and begins building an immune response and making antibodies. mRNA vaccines do not affect, interact with or alter your DNA in any way7Pfizer Bivalent COVID -19 Vaccine - Adult Formulation 12 years and older Dosage/Route 0.3 mL / IM (deltoid or vastus lateralis) Packaging Multi- dose vial - 6 doses per vial (Gray Cap) Diluent No Eligibility As per indications IndicationsPrimary series: all individuals 12 years of age and older (refer to biological page for more details) Booster Dose: all individuals 12 years of age and older (refer to biological page for more details) CompositionmRNA - nucleoside- modified mRNA (modRNA) platform, original (LNPs) no adjuvants, preservatives and antibiotics ScheduleHealthy Individuals 12 years of age and older Primary Series (refer to biological page for more details ) Dose 1: Day 0 Dose 2: at least 8 weeks after dose 1 Individuals with certain immunocompromising conditions 12 years of age and olderPrimary series (refer to biological page for more details) Dose 1: Day 0 Dose 2: 28 days after dose 1 Dose 3: 8 weeks after dose 2 Pfizer Bivalent 12 years of age and older Vaccine Summary 8Pfizer Bivalent COVID -19 Vaccine 5-11 years of age Dosage/Route mL (10 / IM (deltoid or vastus lateralis) Packaging Multi- dose: 2 mL vial - 10 doses once diluted (Orange Vial Cap and Orange Label Border) Diluent Yes Eligibility As per indication IndicationPrimary series: all individuals 5 -11 years of age(refer to biological page for more details) Booster Dose: all individuals 5 -11 years of age (refer to biological page for more details) CompositionmRNA (new technology) - nucleoside- modified mRNA ( modRNA (LNPs) no adjuvants, preservatives or antibiotics ScheduleHealthy Individuals 5 -11 years of age Primary Series (refer to biological page for more details ) Dose 1: Day 0 Dose 2: at least 8 weeks after dose 1 Individuals with certain immunocompromising conditions 5 -11 years of age Primary series (refer to biological page for more details) Dose 1: Day 0 Dose 2: 28 days after dose 1 Dose 3: 8 weeks after dose 2 Pfizer Bivalent 5 to 11 Years Vaccine Summary 9Moderna Bivalent COVID -19 Vaccine Dosage/Route 0.25 mL / IM (6 months to 11 years) 0.5 mL/IM (12 years and older) (deltoid or vastus lateralis) Packaging Multi- dose vial: Royal blue cap & grey label Diluent No Eligibility As per indication IndicationPrimary series for individuals 6 months to 4 years of age Primary series for moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals 6 months of age and older CompositionmRNA (new technology) - nucleoside- modified mRNA (modRNA) platform, original (LNPs) no adjuvants, preservatives and antibiotics ScheduleHealthy Children 6 months to 4 years of age Primary Series (refer to biological page for more details ) Dose 1: Day 0 Dose 2: at least 8 weeks after dose 1 Individuals with certain immunocompromising conditions 6 months of age and olderPrimary series (refer to biological page for more details) Dose 1: Day 0 Dose 2: 28 days after dose 1 Dose 3: 8 weeks after dose 2 Moderna Bivalent Vaccine Summary 10Pfizer Bivalent 12 Years and older and 5- 11 Years Vaccine Storage Pfizer Bivalent mRNA VaccineStorage temperatures and time limits Primary storage: Freezer-90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0 C until 18 months from manufacture date Storage:Thawed, Unpunctured +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0 C for 10 weeks OR +8\u00b0C to +25\u00b0 C for 12 hours Usage Limit: Thawed, Punctured+2\u00b0C to +25\u00b0 C for 12 hours DO NOT REFREEZE OR STORE ON DRY ICE OR BELOW -90\u00b0C DO NOT SHAKE PROTECT FROM LIGHT, ONCE THAWED CAN BE HANDLED IN ROOM LIGHT CONDITIONS11Moderna Bivalent Vaccine Storage Moderna Bivalent mRNA limits Primary -15\u00b0 C until expiration date Storage:Thawed, Unpunctured+2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0 C for 30 days OR +8\u00b0C to +25\u00b0 C for 24 hours Usage Limit: Thawed, Punctured+2\u00b0C to +25\u00b0 C for 24 hours Thaw in refrigerator for 2 hours (let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before administration) or Thaw at room temperature for 45 minutes DO NOT REFREEZE OR STORE ON DRY ICE OR BELOW -50\u00b0C DO NOT SHAKE PROTECT FROM LIGHT12 Vaccine Preparation Refer to IPSM Standards: Preparation of Pfizer BioNTech Bivalent Original & Omicron BA.4/BA.5 COVID -19 Vaccine for 12 Years of Age and Older Preparation of Pfizer BioNTech Bivalent Original & Omicron BA.4/BA.5 COVID -19 Vaccine for ages 5- 11 Years13Pfizer Bivalent 12 Years and Older and 5- 11 Years Vaccine Reactions Common Uncommon Rare Pain, erythema and swelling at the injection site Pain in extremity* Fever, chills Fatigue Headache, myalgia, reported cases following Pfizer Bivalent 12 Y or 5- 11 Years during the study period.

As with any immunization, unexpected or unusual side effects can occur. Refer to product monograph for more detailed information. 15Bivalent Vaccine Efficacy Real-world effectiveness data from the United States (US) and Europe suggest that in children and adults, a booster dose of a bivalent BA.4/5 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine provides increased protection against infection, symptomatic disease and severe outcomes, compared to those who only received doses of original monovalent mRNA vaccines in the past . In studies where bivalent Omicron-containing booster recipients were compared to those who received an original booster dose in the same time period, the protection of a bivalent booster against symptomatic disease was similar to or slightly higher than that offered by original boosters against symptomatic disease. - Updated guidance on COVID -19 boost doses in Canada, National Advisory Committee on Immunization, June 9, 202316Bivalent Vaccines & Immunocompromising Conditions Specific immunocompromising conditions that make an individual eligible for a three -dose primary bivalent series include: Solid organ transplant recipients pre-transplant and post -transplant Hematopoietic stem cell transplants recipients pre-transplant and post - transplant while in immunosuppressed state (post -HSCT individuals are generally considered to be immunocompetent after 3 years as long as they are not on immunosuppressive drugs) Individuals with malignant hematologic disorders and non-hematologic malignant solid tumors prior to receiving or receiving active treatment which includes chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy or having received previous COVID -19 vaccines while on active treatment (does not include individuals receiving solely hormonal therapy, radiation therapy or a surgical intervention). Individuals with chronic kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Individuals receiving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.17Bivalent Vaccines & Immunocompromising Conditions Individuals on: olong term high- dose systemic steroid treatment (prednisone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day or 20 mg/day if weight > 10 kg, for 14 days), or oalkylating agents, or oIndividuals on anti -B-cell therapies - including anti -CD19, anti -CD20, anti - CD22 and anti -CD52 immunosuppressive at clinicians' discretion HIV-infected individuals without viral suppression or those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Individuals with moderate to severe primary immunodeficiency (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome).18All individuals 12 years of age and older are eligible for a SINGLE bivalent booster dose At least 6 calendar months after completion of a primary series (regardless of vaccine type) or an mRNA original (non-bivalent) or non-mRNA booster dose or infection. If requested by their specialist, a shortened interval of at least 3 calendar months between the previous COVID -19 vaccine dose (or infection) and the Omicron-containing bivalent booster dose may be provided for HSCT and/or CAR T -cell therapy recipients. A written request from the specialist is not required if the client provides verbal confirmation. A longer interval of at least 6 calendar months leads to a better immune response against COVID -19 that is also expected to last longer, because it allows time for the immune response to mature in breadth and strength.Pfizer Bivalent Vaccine Booster Dose19The following individuals are eligible for an additional bivalent COVID -19 booster dose: Individuals 65 years of age and older. Individuals 18 years of age and older who are residents of a long-term care facility or other congregate care living setting. Individuals 18 years of age and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised (due to underlying condition or treatment).Pfizer Bivalent Additional Vaccine Booster Dose20At least 6 calendar months after previous bivalent booster dose or infection. oA shortened interval of at least 3 calendar months between the previous COVID -19 vaccine dose (or infection) and the Omicron-containing bivalent booster may be considered for individuals who are living in a long -term care facility or in other congregate care living settings. However, a longer interval of at least 6 calendar months leads to a better immune response against COVID -19 that is also expected to last longer, because it allows time for the immune response to mature in breadth and strength. oIf requested by their specialist, a shortened interval of at least 3 calendar months between the previous COVID -19 vaccine dose (or infection) and the Omicron - containing bivalent booster dose may be provided for HSCT and/or CAR T -cell therapy recipients. A written request from the specialist is not required if the client provides verbal confirmation. Pfizer Bivalent Additional Vaccine Booster Dose21Note: Applicable congregate care settings include, but are not limited to, all private and public long-term care facilities, licensed supportive living facilities and seniors' lodges including First Nations elder care lodges. Immunization for immunocompromised individuals should occur at a time when the individual is most likely to mount an immune response. Clients are recommended to consult with their physician regarding the timing of immunization based on their individual treatment and unique circumstances, respecting the NACI recommended minimum spacing of at least 6 months since last COVID -19 dose (or infection). Pfizer Bivalent Additional Vaccine Booster Dose22A single bivalent booster dose is recommended for children 5 to 11 years of age who have completed a primary series of COVID -19 vaccine and have not previously received an mRNA original (non-bivalent) COVID -19 booster dose. At least 6 calendar months after the last dose of COVID -19 vaccine (regardless of vaccine type) or infection. Note: Healthy children 5 to 11 years of age who already received an original (non -bivalent) booster dose are considered up to date and an additional Omicron -containing bivalent booster dose is not indicated. If requested by their specialist, a shortened interval of at least 3 calendar months between the previous COVID -19 vaccine dose (or infection) and the Omicron -containing bivalent booster dose may be provided for HSCT and/or CAR T -cell therapy recipients. A written request from the specialist is not required if the client provides verbal confirmation. Pfizer Bivalent 5- 11 Years Vaccine Booster Dose23Children who have immunocompromising conditions as previously listed or any of the following conditions who previously received an original (non-bivalent) COVID - 19 booster dose are eligible for an Omicron-containing bivalent booster dose: Cerebrovascular disease Chronic liver diseases Chronic lung diseases Cystic fibrosis Diabetes mellitus: type I and II Disabilities (Down Syndrome, learning, intellectual, or developmental disabilities; spinal cord injuries) Heart conditions (cardiomyopathies, coronary artery disease, heart failure, etc.) Mental health disorders Obesity Primary immunodeficiency diseases TuberculosisPfizer Bivalent 5- 11 Years Vaccine Additional Booster Dose24Very rare cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following immunization with Moderna vaccines have been reported during post -authorization use. There is an increased risk for myocarditis following immunization with Moderna vaccine, particularly within the first week following receipt of the second primary series dose or first booster dose in male young adults. Very rare cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following immunization with Pfizer -BioNTech vaccines have been reported during post -authorization use. These cases occurred more commonly after the second dose and in adolescent and young adults. Typically, the onset of symptoms has been within a few days following receipt of the vaccine. Bivalent COVID -19 Vaccine & Myocarditis25The risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis after a primary series dose of an original mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to 11 years of age is now known to be substantially lower compared to the risk following mRNA COVID -19 vaccines in individuals 12 to 29 years of age (in whom the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis is the highest) and individuals 30 to 49 years of age (in whom there is no preference between Pfizer -BioNTech Comirnaty original or Moderna Spikevax original for the primary series). However, it should be noted that the low rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis with the primary series in children 5 to 11 years of age have been in the context of the predominant use of Pfizer -BioNTech Comirnaty original (10 mcg) in this age group. Emerging Canadian safety surveillance data suggest an extended interval between the first and second dose may reduce the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis following the second dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine.Bivalent COVID -19 Vaccine & Myocarditis26Generally, deferral of COVID -19 immunization is not required for those with a prior history of myocarditis or pericarditis that is unrelated to COVID -19 mRNA vaccines. oIf these individuals have questions or concerns about their prior history of myocarditis or pericarditis and immunization, it is recommended that individuals consult with their clinician. However, consultation with a clinician is not required to receive COVID -19 vaccines. Individuals with a history compatible with pericarditis within 6 weeks of receiving a dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine, who either had no cardiac workup or who had normal cardiac investigations, can be re-immunized when they are symptom free and at least 90 days have passed since previous immunization Bivalent COVID -19 Vaccine & M yocarditis27In most circumstances, further doses of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines should be deferred among people who experienced myocarditis (with or without pericarditis) within 6 weeks of receiving a previous dose of an mRNA COVID - 19 vaccine. oHowever, further doses may be offered if individuals with confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis with abnormal cardiac investigation choose to receive another dose of vaccine after discussing the risks and benefits with their clinician. oInformed consent should discuss the unknown risk of recurrence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following additional doses of COVID -19 vaccine in individuals with a history of confirmed myocarditis and/or pericarditis after a previous dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. Bivalent COVID -19 Vaccine & M yocarditis28It is unknown if individuals with a history of previous myocarditis are at higher risk of vaccine-associated myocarditis. Anyone receiving an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine should be informed of the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis and advised to seek medical attention if they develop related symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain, or the feeling of a rapid or abnormal heart rhythm. Healthcare professionals are advised to consider the possibility of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in their differential diagnosis if individuals present with chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or other signs and symptoms of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following immunization with an mRNA COVID - 19 vaccine. Bivalent COVID -19 Vaccine & M yocarditis29A possible association between Pfizer -BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent BA.4/5 booster and ischemic stroke in persons 65 years of age and older was identified by the US Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) in January 2023. To date, the totality of the US data suggests that it is very unlikely that the potential signal in VSD represents a true clinical risk, and a similar signal has not been identified in Canada, Israel, Europe, and Singapore. Monitoring of the potential safety signal is ongoing. Bivalent COVID -19 Vaccine & M yocarditis30Contraindications Pfizer 12 years and Older Formulation - Less than 12 years of age Pfizer 5 -11 Year Formulation - Less than 5 years of age or 12 years of age and older. Moderna - Less than 6 months of age Have a known severe hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine: oOne non -medicinal ingredient in the vaccine known to cause type 1 hypersensitivity reactions is polyethylene glycol (PEG). This potential allergen may be found in bowel preparation products for colonoscopy, skin care products, dermal fillers, cosmetics, contact lens solutions, products such as ultrasound gel, laxatives , cough syrup, and some food and drinks. oTromethamine (trometamol or Tris ) - component found in contrast media, oral and parenteral medications. oAnaphylaxis to a previous dose of COVID -19 vaccine. See COVID-19 Immunization for Individuals with Allergies and Other Health Conditions for recommendations. Known severe hypersensitivity to a previous dose of Bivalent COVID -19 vaccine31Individuals who have had a serious allergic reaction to another vaccine, drug or food should talk to their health care provider before receiving the vaccine. Individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with a bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection should not be given the vaccine unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of administration. Administration should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness. There are no clinical data currently available for the use of Pfizer bivalent (Original & Omicron BA.4/5) vaccine. However, indirect data (clinical and post - market safety data from Pfizer -BioNTech Comirnaty BA.1 Bivalent and Comirnaty BioNTech Comirnaty BA.4/5 Bivalent (30 mcg) will likely be well tolerated with a similar safety profile to Comirnaty non-bivalent (30 mcg) and Comirnaty BA.1 Bivalent (30 mcg), when used as a booster dose.Precautions32Available evidence from Canada and internationally show that overall, the safety profile of bivalent mRNA COVID -19 vaccine boosters is comparable to that of original mRNA vaccine boosters among individuals 5 years of age and older. Despite the limited evidence on the use of bivalent vaccines as a primary series, the precautionary principle indicates that scientific uncertainty should not prevent decision makers from taking action to reduce risks associated with COVID -19. Use of bivalent vaccines for the primary series primes na\u00efve individuals with both Omicron and original SARS -CoV -2 variants which will help to maximize the breadth of immunity at the earliest opportunity.Precautions33The safety and efficacy of Moderna Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4/5 in individuals under 6 years of age has not yet been established. However, the safety and immunogenicity of Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 (25 mcg) as a primary series was evaluated in a Phase 3 open-label study in 179 unimmunized children 6 months to 5 years of age. oLocal and systemic reactogenicity after dose 1 and dose 2 of Moderna Spikevax bivalent BA.1 (25 mcg) were similar compared to those after dose 1 and dose 2 of Moderna Spikevax original (25 mcg). oThere were no reports of vaccine-related serious adverse events, myocarditis and/or pericarditis or deaths. Given the number of participants enrolled in the trial, it is unlikely that uncommon, rare or very rare adverse events would be detected.Precautions34Interval between previous COVID -19 infection and COVID -19 immunization: Suggested intervals are based on immunological principles and expert opinion, and may change as evidence on COVID -19, variants of concern (VOCs), and COVID -19 vaccines emerge. When considering whether or not to administer vaccine doses following the suggested intervals outlined in the tables found in the biological pages, biological and social risk factors for exposure (e.g., local epidemiology, circulation of VOCs, living settings) and risk of severe disease should also be considered. These intervals are a guide and clinical discretion is advised. Individuals can be immunized at less than the recommended intervals from infection upon request. For individuals who have not had any previous doses, they may receive their first dose after acute symptoms of COVID -19 have resolved and they are no longer infectious, or they may follow the intervals found in thetables in the biological pages (except for those with MIS -C who should wait at least 90 days).Other Considerations35Individuals presenting for immunization do not need to be tested for previous COVID -19 infection. Immunization of individuals who may be currently infected with SARS -CoV -2 is not known to have a detrimental effect on the illness. However, individuals with COVID -19-like symptoms, should not go to an immunization venue in order to minimize the risk of COVID -19 transmission and their immunization should be deferred. They should isolate, seek testing and get immunized as per guidance in the 'Interval between previous COVID -19 infection and COVID -19 immunization' section. Individuals within facilities who are isolated due to COVID -19-like symptoms can be provided COVID -19 vaccine as long as they are well enough to be immunized. It is not recommended that serology testing be completed to determine if an immune response to the COVID -19 vaccine has been mounted in individuals. It is still unknown what antibody level correlates with protection against COVID -19, and serology testing in many labs may also not detect antibodies developed as a response to vaccine. Serology testing should not be used as evidence to inform whether vaccine doses have been effective.Other Considerations36Review IPSM for Further Information Administration with Other Products Pregnancy Breastfeeding Informed Consent37Clinical immunization questions should first be directed to your Site Lead.
