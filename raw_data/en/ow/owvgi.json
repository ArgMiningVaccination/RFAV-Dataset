When I first set out to explore anthroposophy more deeply, I knew I had to do an episode about anthroposophic medicine. It was an area of anthroposophy I knew almost nothing about. Plus I have a general interest in health and wellbeing, as I think many people are who gravitate toward a holistic approach to education like Waldorf. Although Waldorf education is completely separate from anthroposophic medicine, it's worth pointing out that there is one large similarity. Anthroposophic medicine looks more deeply at factors impacting ones health, just as Waldorf looks at more than just the intellect as part of educating the whole child. In the episode we discuss the way an anthroposophic doctor looks at a fever. To an anthroposophic doctor, a fever isn't just a number on a thermometer, it's also about what developmental stage the human being is at. An anthoposophic doctor may look at additional factors to help guide them in how to manage that fever. To me, this seemed similar to my understanding of Waldorf education. Within a Waldorf approach to education a teacher doesn't only put value on a test score. Different curriculum is presented dependent on the developmental stage of the child. Anthopsosphic Medicine offers additional tools for looking at human health and wellbeing. Just as I see, Waldorf education adds more to a traditional approach to education. My guest Dr. Adam Blanning does a fantastic job of explaining what anthroposophic medicine is and how it's practiced. In the episode we go deeper than just speaking about this holistic approach to medicine. Dr. Blanning and I also touch on how anthroposophic medicine looks at helping individuals and children with physical and cognitive disabilities, and anthoposophic cancer treatments.
