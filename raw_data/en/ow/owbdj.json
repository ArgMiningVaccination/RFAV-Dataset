Once you have chosen an essential oil, add a few drops to a diffuser (with water as directed) or put 2-3 drops on a cotton ball and inhale the aroma throughout your meditation session. The fragrance of the oil will help promote relaxation, allowing you to connect with yourself on a deeper level. When beginning your mediation session, set an intention for what you want to achieve from your practice and take some deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth. This will help bring awareness to your body and focus on the moment. As you start to become more relaxed in this state of mind, allow yourself to open up to any thoughts that come up during this time while focusing on the aroma of the essential oil around you. At the end of your session, thank yourself for taking some time out of your day to dedicate to self-care and reflective thought.
