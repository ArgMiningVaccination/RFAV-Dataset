These tools are growing in popularity and in number because they can improve patient outcomes. CPGs help to improve consistency in care delivery by reducing inappropriate variations in patient care. The Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines will support practitioners in providing high quality care for the prevention and treatment of different causes of skin integrity breakdown. The objectives of the guidelines are: To promote evidence-based care in clinical practice; To emphasize ulcer prevention; To promote standardized ulcer care for patients across the province; To incorporate Saskatchewan-speci c content and resources; and To create a multidisciplinary focus for patient care. Consistent and appropriate use of these guidelines will assist in preventing ulcers from occurring and in healing existing ulcers; thereby, helping reduce the burden of illness due to ulcers for both patients and staff. Use of evidence-based dressings, equipment, and techniques will improve patient care and reduce the overall costs of ulcer care. The guidelines are intended to be a shared reference for clinicians and administrators involved directly or indirectly with the prevention or treatment of ulcers. Pocket guides produced elsewhere are available for individuals to use more conveniently at the bedside. Guideline Development Process In October 2003, the Saskatchewan Association of Health Organizations (SAHO) convened a provincial committee of health care providers and materials management representatives working in the area of skin and wound care. The Health Quality Council (HQC) attended the rst meeting, where it was decided a provincial strategy was needed to ensure consistent, quality skin and wound care for patients throughout the province. The committee identi ed the need for evidence-based guidelines, standardized clinical resources, and providing nurses and physicians with education, research analyses, and access to clinical experts. In January 2004, the HQC and SAHO established an Action Committee to provide direction and support in developing and implementing a provincial strategy. The committee, co-chaired by the HQC and SAHO, was made up of representatives from several regional health districts and other professionals. Due to the large number of clinical practice guidelines that already exist in the area of skin and wound care, the authors of these guidelines chose to build on this work by adapting existing guidelines for practice in Saskatchewan. The Committee started with pressure ulcer and lower leg ulcer guidelines. A separate provincial committee developed the diabetic foot ulcer guidelines. The SAHO Skin and Wound Management Committee will be responsible for the regular review, necessary revisions, and the subsequent dissemination of updated sections of this document to ensure it remains consistent with best practice.Skin and Wound Care Guidelines A-1 IntroductionSkin and Wound Care Guidelines A-1 Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Action Committee Members Clint Burlock, CPPB Director Material Management Services SAHO Donna Christensen, B.O.T.

We offer our heartfelt congratulations to the HQC and to the many individuals who were engaged in developing these guidelines. Evidence-based practice supports the excellence in service that we as health-care professionals are committed to delivering in our day-to-day practice. However, the translation of evidence into tools that are readily applicable to practice requires rigorous and expert work and financial support. RNAO acknowledges the Government of Ontario for recognizing our leadership ability, and for generously funding what is now the largest Nursing Best Practice Guidelines Program in Canada, and amongst the best known and most utilized in the world. The program, led by a team of experts, counts on the unwavering support and voluntary hours fr om our nursing community who provide topic-specific expertise which is ess ential for the development, implementation, evaluation and revision of each guideline. We also take this opportunity to acknowledge both Ontario and Saskatchewan employers who are enthusiastically working towards a culture of evidence-based practice. Partnerships such as this one, between HQC and RNAO, provide tremendous opportunity to share expertise in the dev elopment of learning communities. Your application of our nursing clinical guidelines and toolkits to your interdisciplinary guidelines is of great interest to us and we look forward to learning from your experience. RNAO is convinced that this type of synergy in knowledge dissemination and uptake will serve to strengthen Canada's health system. Successful uptake of these guidelines at the point of care requires a concerted effort from nurses, physicians, dietitians and all other health-care providers, as well as educators in academic and practice settings and employers. After lodging these guidelines into their minds and hearts, know ledgeable and skillful health-care providers and students need healthy and supportive work environments to help bring these guidelines to life. We ask that you share your successes and challenges in utilizing these guidelines with us at RNAO. There is much to learn from one another. Together, we can ensure that Canadians receive the best possible care every time they come in contact with us. Let's make them the real winners in this important effort! RNAO is delighted to have had the pleasure to contribute to your success and we look forward to future opportunities for collaboration. On behalf of RNAO's Board of Directors, members and staff we extend to you our most sincere congratulations. Together, we are building a healthier Canada! Doris Grinspun, RN, MSN, PhD(c), O.Ont.

B10Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006B-4 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines B-4 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Introduction A wound is a laceration or break in tissue integrity. Every wound, irrespective of type or degree of tissue damage, triggers a process designed to form new structures similar to the original tissue to restore anatomic continuity and function. Wound healing is a localized regeneration process, which is determined by the overall condition of the person and infl uenced by factors such as age, nutrition, medication, and metabolic condition. It is necessary to understand the process of normal wound healing and factors that affect its progress in order to provide appropriate skin and wound care. Normal Wound Healing Normal wound healing proceeds in four interrelated and overlapping dynamic phases: Hemostasis Hemostasis is characterized by clot formation resulting in cessation of bleeding. This process is enhanced by a 5-10 minute phase of vasoconstriction. The ultimate effect of coagulation is the conversion of brinogen to brin stabilizing the initial clot. Clot formation facilitates the migration of cells and begins the process of broblast proliferation into the wounded area. Platelet activity, integral to the establishment of a hemostatic plug, is mediated by the release of platelet-derived growth factor, platelet factor 4, transforming growth factor and transforming growth factor . These substances stimulate the synthesis of extracellular matrix and initiate tissue repair.1 Medical conditions or medications that alter the body's ability to clot will slow down the initiation of healing. Infl ammation This is the body's defense mechanism against bacterial invasion. Neutrophils and monocytes are attracted at the same time to the wound site. The neutrophils are the most abundant cell present in this phase of healing. Neutrophils migrate through the blood vessels to accumulate in the periphery of the wounded tissue. The main function of these cells is to phagocytose local bacteria and debris. The infl ammatory environment stimulates the release of toxic reactive oxygen intermediates that destroy the contaminating bacteria. The later phases of infl ammation are characterized by conversion of monocytes to macrophages. Wound macrophages continue the process of phagocytosis. They generate chemotactic factors and these factors attract additional infl ammatory cells. Macrophages are also thought to release growth factorsgrowth factors critical to the coordination of granulation tissuegranulation tissue formation.1 Any medical conditions (autoimmune diseases) or anti-infl ammatory medications will alter this phase and delay healing. Proliferation The phase of proliferation overlaps infl ammation. The key cells of this phase of healing are the broblasts and myo broblasts. Fibroblasts secrete a loose extracellular matrix that is rich in collagen. Collagen synthesis peaks 5-7 days Skin and Wound Care Guidelines B-5 Normal Wound Healing Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines B-5 post injury. Once this extracellular matrix is deposited the broblasts cease collagen production. Myo broblasts have been implicated in a process of wound healing called wound contraction. Wound contraction is the reduction of a tissue defect by the centripedal movement of the surrounding skin. This process of contraction will peak at approximately two weeks after the injury and varies in its ability to reduce wound size by the depth of the wound and the tension of the surrounding tissue. Angiogenesis or the formation of new blood cells occurs simultaneously with the above two cellular processes. This is the process where capillaries bud from pre-existing small vessels found in close proximity to the wound to form granulation tissue. Granulation tissue is very metabolically active and requires a rich blood supply. If there is insuf cient arterial infl ow to support the formation of this tissue, broblasts and macrophages will stop proliferating and healing will be altered. Re-epithelialization occurs as keratinocytes migrate across the wound defect. This process is aided by moisture at tissue level. This epithelial tissue is very fragile and is unattached to the wound surface until complete coverage has occurred.1 Maturation Remodeling of the immature tissue matrix occurs at the same time as granulation tissue formation. The very vascular granulation tissue is gradually replaced and remodeled forming scar tissue. The composition of the extracellular matrix is in a state of constant change from the time it is rst deposited. Tensile strength of the scar tissue is created by collagen deposition and also realignment and remodeling of the tissue. This process occurs for a period of months or years after initial wound closure. The functional strength of scar tissue can only regain up to 70-80% of its pre-injury strength and so is less resistant to tissue breakdown than previous to the injury occurring.1Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006B-6 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines B-6 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Interpretation of Evidence The recommendations made in these best practice guidelines have been critically reviewed and categorized by strength of evidence. Unless otherwise stated, the strength of evidence was determined by the RNAO Panel Members. The RNAO used two different systems for rating the level of evidence. The following taxonomy provides the de nitions of the strengths of evidence and the rating system for the two systems. Levels of Evidence Levels of Evidence (used for Risk Assessment & Prevention of Pressure Ulcers) Strength of Evidence A Requires at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) as part of the body of literature of overall quality and consistency addressing the speci c recommendations.Strength of Evidence Ia Evidence obtained from meta-analysis or systematic review of randomized control trials. Strength of Evidence Ib Evidence obtained from at least one randomized control trial. Strength of Evidence B Requires availability of well-conducted clinical studies but no randomized clinical trials on the topic of recommendations.Strength of Evidence IIa Evidence obtained from at least one well-designed controlled study without randomization. Strength of Evidence IIb Evidence obtained from at least one other type of well-designed quasi-experimental study without randomization. Strength of Evidence III Evidence obtained from well-designed non-experimental descriptive studies, such as comparative studies, correlation studies and case studies. Strength of Evidence C Requires evidence from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experience of respected authorities. Indicates absence of directly applicable studies of good quality.Strength of Evidence IV Evidence obtained from expert committee reports or opinions or clinical experience of respected authorities. Underlined words can be found in the GlossarySkin and Wound Care Guidelines B-7 Normal Wound Healing Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines B-7 Factors Affecting Wound Healing The following factors affect the rate of wound healing: Metabolic Disorders Systemic diseases (e.g., hepatic, renal, cardiac or lymphedema) can lead to increased wound edema and subsequent increased risk of infection and a reduction in epithelialization. Strength of evidence = B Clients with diabetes have an altered immune response. Strength of evidence = B Optimal wound healing is achieved by a holistic approach including blood sugar and blood pressure management. Strength of evidence = C Nutrition Nutritional de ciencies are associated with a prolonged infl ammatory response and delayed wound healing. Lack of key vitamins and minerals can be a signi cant deterrent to healing. Strength of evidence = C Medications The most frequently encountered medications that are detrimental to wound healing are: systemic steroids, alcohol, NSAIDS and antineoplastics. Strength of evidence = B Ischemia Wound hypoxia is harmful to all wound healing. Adequate evaluation of the client's circulatory status is essential. Strength of evidence = C Infection All chronic wounds harbor bacteria but as long as there are no overt clinical signs and symptoms of infection treatment is not indicated. Strength of evidence = C The presence of foreign bers (gauze) or necrotic debris in a wound may predispose it to infection. Strength of evidence = B Topical antibiotics should not be chosen at random and should be used for a maximum of 14 days. Strength of evidence = A Treatment regimes Wound cleansing should be performed using normal saline or sterile water at a pressure per square inch of 4-15. This can be achieved through the use of a 35 ml syringe and 19 gauge angiocath or 100 ml single use saline squeeze bottle. Strength of evidence = B Wipe down the wound edges only. Gauze wiped across newly epithelializing tissue can remove all new cell growth. Strength of evidence = C Consider non-adherent dressings to reduce the risk of tissue trauma in minimally exudating wounds. Maintain a moist, not wet, wound environment. Strength of evidence B/C Psychosocial well being Stress and insomnia may impact upon wound healing. Strength of evidence = B Aging Aging reduces the rate of healing and alters all phases of healing. Elderly individuals typically have increased skin fragility and special care must be taken to reduce tissue damage with dressing changes. Strength of evidence = C Smoking Nicotine is a vasoconstrictive drug and will limit oxygen supply to tissues and reduce the potential for healing. Smoking has been shown to cause an increase in scar formation and an increased risk of infection. Strength of evidence = A Malignancy Wounds are at risk for malignancy.2 If healing does not occur a biopsy should be obtained. Strength of evidence = C Source: Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Action Committee, 2006. Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006B-8 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines B-8 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Infection Prevention and Control The overriding principles of Infection Prevention and Control apply in management of each type of wound addressed in the guidelines. The following infection prevention and control procedures should be implemented when carrying out wound care in accordance with Guidelines: Hand Washing All personnel must wash hands with soap and water, for 10 seconds, or as an alternative, an antisepticantiseptic , waterless hand rub product, prior to and after any contact with the patient, and after the removal of gloves. Clean Technique Clean technique involves strategies used in patient care to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from one person to another or from one place to another. Clean technique means no-touch-dressing technique, clean supplies and sterile normal saline or recommended wound cleanser. Whether an individual is allowed to shower or bathe depends on the clinical situation and must be approved by the attending physician. No touch dressing technique is a method of changing surface dressings without directly touching the wound or any surface that might come in contact with the wound. The accepted practice in continuing care centers and the community is clean technique.3 Aseptic Technique Aseptic technique is the purposeful prevention of the transfer of microorganisms from one person to another by keeping the microbial count to an irreducible minimum, and includes the application of principles for assuring that cross- contamination does not occur. Aseptic technique must be used during dressing changes, wound irrigationirrigation and debridement procedures to avoid introduction of microorganisms into the wound. Sterile gloves must be worn.3,4 Wound Cleansing Agents Before any wound cleansing agent is used, it should be inspected for any evidence of damage to the bottle, leaking, foreign material, mold, or fungus. The wound cleansing agent should be handled in a manner to avoid contamination of the fl uid itself, the inside of the neck of the bottle, and the inside of the top of the cap. Containers of sterile normal saline, if not contaminated, may be resealed and labeled with a 24-hour expiration time.5 Solutions used for wound cleansing should never be \"topped up\" from bulk containers into small ones. Unused contents of single use non-resealable containers of normal saline should be discarded following use. Wound cleansing agents dispensed from a spray applicator (e.g., Sea-Clens) must be used according to the manufacturer's directions and be dedicated to single-patient use. When cleansing a wound with a spray applicator product, the container must be held 15 to 20 centimeters from the wound bed to prevent contamination of the bottle and its contents.Skin and Wound Care Guidelines B-9 Normal Wound Healing Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines B-9 Dressing, Pastes, Gels Opened dressings, pastes or gels should be labeled, dedicated to single-patient use and stored in a clean area between use. Outer packaging and containers of pastes and gels must be handled with clean hands. Care must be taken not to contaminate the contents of the packages or containers. Manufacturer's written recommendations for shelf life and storage conditions should be followed. Waste Disposal All used dressings and disposable supplies should be contained in plastic bags and placed in the general waste. IrrigationIrrigation solution and wound drainage may be disposed of by carefully pouring (to prevent splashing) into the hopper or toilet. Silver nitrate solution should be disposed of in a sealed container. All used disposable sharp instruments (e.g., needles, lancets, scalpel blades, broken or easily broken glass items) should be placed at the point of use, in a puncture-resistant, leak-proof, impervious container for disposal.6 Personal Protective Equipment Gloves should be worn for contact with the wound or wound drainage. Cover gowns or aprons, masks, and eye protection should be worn by caregivers when splash or spray from wound drainage is anticipated. These measures will assist in prevention of transmission of infection to the caregivers and to other patients/residents. Antibiotic Resistant Organisms If the individual is known to be colonized or infected with a signi cant antibiotic -resistant organism methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE] ), it should be communicated to personnel responsible for Infection Prevention and Control in the health care facility or home care program. When the patient is transferred, infection prevention and control personnel in the receiving health care facility or home care program must be noti ed in advance of the time of transfer.

The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument was used.1 As a result of this review, the committee adapted the following evidence-based clinical practice guidelines developed by the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) to include content speci c to Saskatchewan: Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario. Risk assessment and prevention of pressure ulcers. Toronto (ON): Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario; 2002. Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario. Assessment and management of stage I to IV pressure ulcers. Toronto (ON): Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario; 2002. The RNAO used the most current research evidence and expert opinion in the creation of their recommendations. The RNAO guidelines were also pilot-tested and evaluated. The Action Committee developed a draft of the Saskatchewan guidelines and distributed it to self-identi ed and selected stakeholders, within and outside the province, for review. The committee incorporated the feedback into another draft of the guidelines, which was implemented in long-term care pilot sites in Saskatchewan. These pilot sites were selected based on an identi ed need and a high interest in improving the quality of care for patients with pressure ulcers. During the pilot testing period, the RNAO reviewed and updated their 2002 Risk Assessment and Prevention of Pressure Ulcers . At the conclusion of the pilot site implementation, the draft guidelines used by the pilot sites were again revised incorporating pilot site feedback and changes found in: Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario.

Stage three and four pressure ulcers are reportable critical events in Saskatchewan. The Health Quality Council worked closely with seven long-term care pilot sites from September 2004 until September 2005 to implement this pressure ulcer guideline which includes wound assessment and management algorithms, tips on positioning for ulcer prevention, and recommended skin and wound care products. The combined results for all pilot sites show a considerable decrease in the number of facility residents who acquired a new pressure ulcer. Effective management of pressure ulcers improves the quality of life for people in long-term care, and in acute care and home care settings. Other bene ts include less staff time spent on wound care and cost savings as fewer products are used.

Pressure ulcers usually occur over a bony prominence and are staged to classify the degree of tissue damage observed.3-5 Prevention of Pressure Ulcers Risk Assessment 1. Risk Assessment 1. Risk Assessment Risk Assessment: 1.1 A head-to-toe skin assessment should be carried out with all clients at admission, transfer of care, and any time there is a change in health status. Particular attention should be paid to vulnerable areas, especially over bony prominences. Strength of Evidence = IV Pressure Points: Dots show pressure points when lying on back (A), when sitting (B), and when lying on side (C). Adapted from: Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.

The use of a tool that has been tested for validity and reliability, such as the Braden Risk Assessment Scale, is recommended. Interventions should be based on identi ed intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors and those identi ed by a risk assessment tool, such as the Braden Scale categories: sensory perception mobility activity Pressure Ulcer: Any lesion caused by unrelieved pressure that results in damage to 1. 1.1 A head-to-toe skin assessment should be carried out with all clients at admission, sensory perception mobility activity Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006C-12 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines C-12 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines moisture nutrition friction shear Risk assessment tools are useful as an aid to structure assessment.

In individuals with darker skin, discoloration of skin, warmth, edema, induration or hardness may also be indicators. Stage II : Partial thickness skin loss involving epidermis, dermis or both. The ulcer is usually super cial and presents clinically as an abrasion, blister or shallow crater. Stage III : Full thickness skin loss involving damage to or necrosis of subcutaneous tissue that may extend down to, but not through, underlying fascia . The ulcer presents clinically as a deep crater with or without underminingundermining of adjacent tissue. Skin and Wound Care Guidelines C-13 Pressure Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines C-13 Stage IV : Full thickness skin loss with extensive destruction, tissue necrosis , or damage to muscle, bone or supporting structures (e.g., tendon, joint capsule).

[Stage X or Unstageable : When eschar or any necrotic tissue is present, it is impossible to stage the ulcer until the devitalized tissue is removed.7] The NPUAP states that reverse staging does not accurately characterize what is lost muscle. When ulcers heal to more shallow depth, lost muscle, subcutaneous fat, or dermis does not re-epithelialize.8 To illustrate: a Stage IV pressure ulcer cannot become a Stage III, Stage II and/or a Stage I. Note : There are differences in staging de nition used by the NPUAP and the Saskatchewan Resident Assessment Instrument-Minimum Data Set (RAI-MDS) 2.0 for Long Term Care. See Pressure Ulcers Appendix C for an explanation of these differences. Pearl of Wisdom: Scar tissue is at increased risk of re-ulceration because it will not achieve greater than 80% of the pre-injury tensile strength. Close monitoring and prevention measures will help protect these at risk areas. 1.5 All data should be documented at the time of assessment and reassessment.

Evaluate once a week and whenever a change occurs in the wound. Rate according to each item by picking the response that best describes the wound and entering that score in the item score column for the appropriate date. When you have rated the wound on all items, determine the total score by adding together the 13-item scores. The HIGHER the total score, the more severe the wound status. Plot total score on the Wound Status Continuum to determine progress. Speci c Instructions:Speci c Instructions: 1. Size: Use ruler to measure the longest and widest aspect of the wound surface in centimeters; multiply length x width. 2. Depth : Pick the depth, thickness, most appropriate to the wound using these additional descriptions: 1 = tissues damaged but no break in skin surface. 2 = super cial, abrasion, blister or shallow crater. Even with, &/or elevated above skin surface (e.g., hyperplasia). 3 = deep crater with or without undermining of adjacent tissue. 4 = visualization of tissue layers not possible due to necrosis. 5 = supporting structures include tendon, joint capsule. 3. Edges : Use this guide: Indistinct, diffuse = unable to clearly distinguish wound outline. Attached = even or fl ush with wound base, no sides or walls present; fl at. Not attached = sides or walls are present; fl oor or base of wound is deeper than edge. Rolled under, thickened = soft to rm and fl exible to touch. Hyperkeratosis = callous-like tissue formation around wound & at edges. Fibrotic, scarred = hard, rigid to touch. 4. Undermining : Assess by inserting a cotton tipped applicator under the wound edge; advance it as far as it will go without using undue force; raise the tip of the applicator so it may be seen or felt on the surface of the skin; mark the surface with a pen; measure the distance from the mark on the skin to the edge of the wound. Continue process around the wound. Then use a transparent metric measuring guide with concentric circles divided into 4 (25%) pie-shaped quadrants to help determine percent of wound involved. 5. Necrotic Tissue Type : Pick the type of necrotic tissue that is predominantpredominant in the wound according to color, consistency and adherence using this guide: White/gray non-viable tissue = may appear prior to wound opening; skin surface is white or gray. Non-adherent, yellow slough = thin, mucinous substance; scattered throughout wound bed; easily separated from wound tissue. Loosely adherent, yellow slough = thick, stringy, clumps of debris; attached to wound tissue. Adherent, soft, black eschar = soggy tissue; strongly attached to tissue in center or base of wound. Firmly adherent, hard/black eschar = rm, crusty tissue; strongly attached to wound base and edges (like a hard scab).Skin and Wound Care Guidelines C-35 Pressure Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines C-35 6. Necrotic Tissue Amount: Use a transparent metric measuring guide with concentric circles divided into 4 (25%) pie-shaped quadrants to help determine percent of wound involved. 7. Exudate Type: Some dressings interact with wound drainage to produce a gel or trap liquid. Before assessing exudate type, gently cleanse wound with normal saline or water. Pick the exudate type that is predominantpredominant in the wound according to color and consistency, using this guide: Bloody = thin, bright red Serosanguineous = thin, watery pale red to pink Serous = thin, watery, clear Purulent = thin or thick, opaque tan to yellow Foul purulent = thick, opaque yellow to green with offensive odour 8. Exudate Amount: Use a transparent metric measuring guide with concentric circles divided into 4 (25%) pie-shaped quadrants to determine percent of dressing involved with exudate. Use this guide: None = wound tissues dry. Scant = wound tissues moist; no measurable exudate. Small = wound tissues wet; moisture evenly distributed in wound; drainage involves < 25% dressing. Moderate = wound tissues saturated; drainage may or may not be evenly distributed in wound; drainage involves > 25% to < 75% dressing. Large = wound tissues bathed in fl uid; drainage freely expressed; may or may not be evenly distributed in wound; drainage involves > 75% of dressing. 9. Skin Color Surrounding Wound: Assess tissues within 4cm of wound edge. Dark-skinned persons show the colors \"bright red\" and \"dark red\" as a deepening of normal ethnic skin color or a purple hue. As healing occurs in dark-skinned persons, the new skin is pink and may never darken. 10. Peripheral Tissue Edema & Induration: Assess tissues within 4cm of wound edge. Non-pitting edema appears as skin that is shiny and taut. Identify pitting edema by rmly pressing a nger down into the tissues and waiting for 5 seconds, on release of pressure, tissues fail to resume previous position and an indentation appears. Induration is abnormal rmness of tissues with margins. Assess by gently pinching the tissues. Induration results in an inability to pinch the tissues. Use a transparent metric measuring guide to determine how far edema or induration extends beyond wound. 11. Granulation Tissue: Granulation tissue is the growth of small blood vessels and connective tissue to ll in full thickness wounds. Tissue is healthy when bright, beefy red, shiny and granular with a velvety appearance. Poor vascular supply appears as pale pink or blanched to dull, dusky red color. 12. Epithelialization: Epithelialization is the process of epidermal resurfacing and appears as pink or red skin. In partial thickness wounds it can occur throughout the wound bed as well as from the wound edges. In full thickness wounds it occurs from the edges only. Use a transparent metric measuring guide with concentric circles divided into 4 (25%) pie-shaped quadrants to help determine percent of wound involved and to measure the distance the epithelial tissue extends into the wound. \u00a9 2001 Barbara Bates-Jensen.

When completing the Saskatchewan Resident Assessment Instrument-Minimum Data Set (RAI-MDS) 2.0 for Long Term Care, current coding instructions must be followed. The Saskatchewan RAI-MDS 2.0 Long Term Care User Manual instructs assessors to identify the stages of a pressure ulcer by describing depth in reverse order from deepest to lesser stages to describe the healing or improvement of a pressure ulcer (reverse staging or back staging). It also instructs assessors to code a pressure ulcer covered with eschar as Stage IV. Use of validated instruments, such as NPUAP , to describe the healing of a pressure ulcer are appropriate for making treatment decisions, however they may not be utilized for coding the MDS. Until the RAI-MDS 2.0 for Long Term Care is revised, the present coding system (reverse staging) must be used for completion of the RAI-MDS 2.0 for Long Term Care. Skin and Wound Care Guidelines C-39 Pressure Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines C-39 PRESSURE ULCERS APPENDIX D Pressure Reduction versus Pressure Relief Surfaces Pressure Reducing Surface : A surface that lowers pressure as compared to a hospital mattress or chair surface, but does not consistently reduce pressure to less than capillary closing pressure (RNAO, 2002). Pressure Relieving Surface : A surface that consistently reduces pressure below capillary closing pressure (RNAO, 2002). It is important to note that pressure relieving does not refer to the removal of all pressure, just lowering of pressure suf ciently to allow blood fl ow.

This, coupled with a smaller surface area, increases surface pressure when under load.1 The one area of the body that can be totally relieved of pressure is the heel. By use of a pillow lengthwise, along the lower part of the leg, the heel can be 'fl oated'. This approach could be indicated for individuals who cannot be turned because of the limitations of traction. A contraindication to limb elevation would be ischemia of the lower limb. There are a variety of devices that are marketed as heel pressure reduction devices and none have been adequately evaluated. Each of these devices needs to be looked at on a individual basis. Each of the devices must be assessed to ensure that the heel is fl oated off of the surface the foot is resting on. All of the devices should be single patient designated for reasons of infection control.

Many factors must be taken into account when selecting a cushion. A trial of at least one cushion is strongly recommended before a nal decision is made. When selecting a wheelchair cushion, it is important to consider the following areas: Braden Scale Sensory perception loss Moisture Activity level Mobility Nutritional status Friction and shear (consider the cushion cover as well as cushion structure) Other factors to be considered: Support needed to maintain sitting balance and good posture Support provided by the chair History of previous pressure ulcer Prominence of high risk areas such as coccyx and ischial tuberosities (especially if due to muscle atrophy) Ability to weight shift and frequency of positional changes Postural alignment Care cushion requires (e.g., resources to repair leaking air cushion) Program coverage/ nancial resources available Transfer requirements Cushions must be carefully checked to ensure that there is suf cient protection between all sitting surfaces and bony prominences. As some cushions wear out quickly, some cushions require additions of air/fl uid and others require kneading; checking regularly for \" bottoming outbottoming out \" is essential. To check if a cushion has bottomed out, place your hand between each bony prominence in turn and check that there is the recommended amount of material between the bony prominence and the sitting surface (this is usually quoted as at least a nger's width). Strength of Evidence =C When choosing a cushion, the wheelchair must also be taken into account. Wheelchairs that have a hammock sling seat often need a solid seat base under the cushion. For high risk clients, power or manual tilt in space wheelchair may be an option to maximize the weight bearing surface. A specialized seating team/physiatrist referral will be required. Pressure mapping with a pressure sensing array is increasingly being used to determine risk areas for skin breakdown, to compare effectiveness of cushions and to design specialized seating to prevent skin breakdown.

This should be: Scienti c evidenced-based research, independent of company studies, and support therapeutic outcomes. Has the research been published in: JAMA, ADVANCE, OSTOMY/WOUND? or similar, reputable, peer reviewed journals or reports? Would you be allowed to tour the company's lab or research centre? Product SupportProduct Support Is the product manufactured by one company and distributed by another? - If yes, which company covers the product warranty? - If a partnership between the manufacturer and distributor ceases, who will honor the warranty? Does the company provide technical and clinical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week? Does the company follow Center of Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for cleaning coverlets and mattresses? Ask for documentation showing this. Product Features Is the mattress latex free? Natural rubber latex is an irritant. Top fabric should be tested for skin irritation using CPSC 16 CFR 1500.41 method. Is it re retardant? Ask to see documentation regarding re speci cations (CAN/CGSB-4.27.7-M89) Safety Code Federal Registration number. What does the company do to their mattress seams to prevent fl uids from seeping through and contaminating the inner core of the mattress? Are the seams welded to prevent contamination from fl uids leaking into the mattress? Is the mattress light-weight and portable? It should meet Occupational Health and Safety Standards in this regard. Does the mattress t the width of the bed frame following the Hospital Bed Safety Workgroup (HBSW) guidelines? Further information is available on the FDA website for Bed Safety, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/beds/ When selecting a static support surfacestatic support surface made of foam, consider the following characteristics: stiffness, density, and thickness. Typical values for foam mattress overlaysoverlays would be a 25% ILD of 30 pounds, a density of 1.3 pounds per cubic foot, and a thickness of 3 to 4 inches (Kemp & Krouskop, 1994). Note: A thicker mattress (e.g., 6-8 inches) is needed for a bed or bariatric ( heavier clients) mattress. Product TestingProduct Testing Does the company address vascular analysis and body temperature response in their research? Interface Pressure-full body mapping should be used to measure interface pressure, not just the seat section. Head Elevations-the mattress should be tested at several head elevations (e.g., 0', 30', 45'). Note : As the head is elevated, the pressure in the coccyx and heel areas is increased. The mattress surface must adjust to reduce interface pressure. What methodology does the company use to reduce pressure in their mattress (e.g., is the mattress zoned)?Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006C-46 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines C-46 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines PRESSURE ULCERS APPENDIX H Pressure Ulcer Staging Pocket Guide Stages of a Pressure Ulcer Stage I : Non-blanchable erythema (area appears red/pink) of intact skin, the heralding lesion of skin ulceration. In individuals with darker skin, discoloration of skin, warmth, edema, induration, or hardness may also be indicators. Stage II : Partial-thickness skin loss of the epidermis, dermis or both. The ulcer is usually super cial and presents clinically as an abrasion, blister or shallow crater. Stage III : Full-thickness skin loss involving damage to or necrosis of subcutaneous tissue that may extend down to, but not through, underlying fascia. The ulcer presents clinically as a deep crater with or without undermining of adjacent tissue.

Undermining sinus tracts also may be associated with Stage IV ulcers. Stage X or Unstageable : When eschar or any necrotic tissue is present, it is impossible to stage the ulcer until the devitalized tissue is removed (Weir, 2001). The NPUAP states that reverse staging does not accurately characterize what is lost muscle. When ulcers heal to more shallow depth, lost muscle, subcutaneous fat, and dermis does not re-epithelialize. To illustrate: a Stage IV pressure ulcer cannot become a Stage III, Stage II and/or a Stage I ulcer. Pictures taken from C. Hess. Clinical Guide: Wound Care (3rd. ed). 1999, pp.16-17.

Pearl of Wisdom: Scar tissue is at increased risk of re-ulceration because it will not achieve greater than 80% of the pre-injury tensile strength. Close monitoring and prevention measures will help protect these at-risk areas.

The Skin and Wound Care Action Committee, co-chaired by the HQC and the Saskatchewan Association of Health Organizations was comprised of skin care experts and representatives from several regional health authorities. It was established in January 2004 with a mandate to provide direction and support in developing and implementing a provincial skin and wound care strategy. The subcommittee adapted the following evidence-based clinical practice guidelines developed by the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) to include content speci c to Saskatchewan: Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario. Assessment and management of venous leg ulcers. Toronto (ON): Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario; 2004. with content from the following RNAO guidelines incorporated: Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario. Assessment and management of stage I to IV pressure ulcers. Toronto (ON): Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario; 2002. The RNAO used the most current research evidence and expert opinion in the creation of its recommendations. Each recommendation was assigned a rating to indicate the strength of the supporting research evidence to date supporting the recommendation. The RNAO guidelines were also pilot-tested and evaluated. The subcommittee developed draft guidelines for lower limb ulcers and distributed them to self-identi ed and selected stakeholders within and outside Saskatchewan for review. The committee incorporated reviewer feedback into a nal draft, which was then added to the Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines.Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-3 Lower Limb Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-3 Interpretation of Evidence The recommendations made in these best practice guidelines have been critically reviewed and categorized by strength of evidence. The following taxonomy provides the de nitions of the strengths of evidence and the rating system. Unless otherwise noted, the source of the evidence is the RNAO guidelines. Strength of Evidence A Requires at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) as part of the body of literature of overall quality and consistency addressing the speci c recommendations. Strength of Evidence B Requires availability of well-conducted clinical studies but no randomized clinical trials on the topic of recommendations. Strength of Evidence C Requires evidence from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experience of respected authorities. Indicates absence of directly applicable studies of good quality. This symbol indicates a pearl of wisdom text box.

D36Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-9 Lower Limb Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-9 Introduction Lower limb ulcers are a common health problem. A recent Canadian study reported a prevalence rate of 1.8 per 1000 for the population 25 years of age and older.1 Leg ulcer disease is often chronic with recurrence rates of up to 76% within one year.2 This guideline outlines the assessment and management techniques related to two common causes of lower limb wounds: chronic venous disease and arterial disease. Chronic venous disease is the main cause of tissue loss and is the underlying cause in 80 to 95% of leg ulcers.3 Ischemia is the diagnosis in approximately 20% of lower limb wounds.4 About 5% of lower extremity wounds are related to other less common etiologies including carcinomas, lymphedema, vasculitis and immunological presentations (pyoderma gangrenosum). The following brief review of these less common etiologies is meant to encourage practitioners to consider other options when wounds do not respond to treatment in a \"usual\" fashion. Malignancies of the lower limb are not uncommon. Any wound that presents in an unusual location with a lack of healinghealing in a six to twelve week period or deterioration should be biopsied for possible malignant tissue growth.5 Lymphedema can occur in isolation or in combination with venous disease. In lymphedema, the diameter of the leg from knee to ankle is uniform rather than indenting in the \"champagne glass\" appearance characteristic of venous disease. Lymphedema is often bilateral and can be of unknown origin. Lymphedema management is compression therapy with wraps or a pneumatic pump, if arterial circulation is adequate.5 Vasculitis is characterized by multiple purpuric lesions, which are typically extremely painful and are often seen bilaterally. Vasculitis most commonly affects the lower leg where the most stasis is apparent in the limb. Vasculitis of the skin may also be associated with other organ involvement (joints, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract are the most common). Skin biopsies are required to determine the cause of the vasculitis and to institute appropriate therapy.5 Pyoderma gangrenosum is a destructive ulceration of the skin that is most commonly found on the calves, thighs, buttocks and face. Usually lesions start after minimal trauma, are extremely painful, and rapidly enlarge. Pyoderma gangrenosum can be of unknown etiology but in approximately half of the cases it is associated with an underlying diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, infl ammatory bowel disease or a hematological malignancy. A biopsy may assist in diagnosis by ruling out other etiologies. Pyoderma gangrenosum is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment may be the use of immunosuppressant agents. Debridement is absolutely contraindicated in the management of these wounds as trauma can cause the lesion to enlarge.5Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006D-10 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-10 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines LOWER LIMB ULCERS ASSESSMENT ALGORITHM ASSESSMENT/DIAGNOSIS Complete history Wound Assessment Vascular Assessment Characteristics Usually located above the malleolus Shallow with irregular borders Typically, large amounts of edema and wound exudate Granulation tissue or yellow sloughslough usually present in the wound bed Peri-wound skin may have dermatitis or maceration Feet are generally warm to touch and pedal pulses are palpableClinical Characteristics May be located anywhere on the lower limb Typically shallow with irregular borders Granulation tissue is usually present Peri-wound skin may have dermatitis or maceration depending on the amount of exudate Feet may be cool to touch with weakened peripheral pulsesClinical Characteristics Located on bony prominences of the lower legs and feet \"Punched out\" appearance with well de ned borders Little/no edema or wound exudate Yellow sloughslough or black/gray eschar in the wound bed with pale granulation tissuegranulation tissue Feet are cool to touch and pedal pulses are weak or not palpable Measurement of Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) by Doppler Ultrasound Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) by Doppler Ultrasound Ankle Brachial Pressure Index Must be done to ULCER MIXED mmHG ABPI between 0.6 - 0.8 mmHGABPI greater than 1.2 or less than 0.6 mmHG Establish underlying etiologySkin and Wound Care Guidelines D-11 Lower Limb Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care completion & compression should be applied by suitably trained & experienced practitionerConsult an advanced wound clinician for treatment decisionRefer to Vascular Surgeon Treat the Cause Elevate legs Calf pump exercises, regular exercise or ROM Weight management Skin care Instructions re: leg elevation, girdles, proper seating, extended standing Education for the need for lifelong compression and lifestyle changesTreat the Cause Elevate legs Calf pump exercises, regular exercise or ROM Weight management Skin care Instructions re: leg elevation, girdles, proper seating, extended standing Education for the need for lifelong compression and lifestyle changesTreat the Cause Risk reduction (i.e., smoking, lipid control, avoid trauma) Maximize nutrition Control underlying medical conditions Exercise as tolerated Proper foot care Medication compliance Compression TherapyCompression Therapy ABPI 0.8 - 1.2 Client quali es for 40 mmHg compression (obtain physician's order) 1.

The deep veins below the knee run parallel to the corresponding arteries, anterior tibial, peroneal, and posterior tibial. There are more than 100 perforator veins in the leg; perforator vein incompetence is responsible for a lack of healinghealing in some venous ulcers. The calf muscle pump is the primary mechanism returning blood from the periphery to the heart. The calf muscles, the deep venous compartment, the super cial veins and the perforator vessels are all part of the system that moves blood, against the force of gravity, to the heart. Venous valves have a signi cant role to play in maintaining the blood's upward fl ow.4 Loss of valve function, causing blood refl ux, or a reduction in the ef cacy of the calf muscle pump can cause venous insuf ciencyinsuf ciency . Initially patients complain of swollen ankles by the end of the day; usually the swelling subsides overnight. Over time the leg edema worsens and the subcutaneous tissue is destroyed with brotic tissue replacing previously normal tissue. Red blood cell leakage into subcutaneous tissue, followed by cell disintegration, causes a brown colour change or hemosiderin staining in the skin. This edema and hyperpigmentation, as well as induration in the gaiter area of the limb are classic signs of venous disease. Venous ulcers may vary in size from very small to circumferential; wounds typically present with irregular borders, yellow brin covering the ulcer surface and moderate to large amounts of exudate . The recurrent nature of these wounds and the large amount of drainage often pre- dispose individuals with venous ulceration to stasis dermatitis. The incidence of ulcer patients ranges from 51-85 per cent.4 Pain is usually reported as a tired, achy sensation, often worse after standing for long periods of time. Venous hypertensionVenous hypertension can cause muscle irritability that may be manifested as nocturnal leg cramps.4Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-13 Lower Limb Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-13 Figure 1.

Arterial disease is progressive and so it is important to recognize and treat complications as early as possible to restrict tissue loss.9 The common presenting complaint with arterial ulceration is pain. Early on in the disease process the pain may only present with exercise; as the disease worsens it may be present at rest. Often the trauma of ill- tting shoes or a heat source (hot water bottle) may be the precipitating factor causing ulceration. When a traumatic injury occurs the body initiates an infl ammatory infl ammatory responseresponse . This response increases local metabolic requirements and blood supply, which may have been barely suf cient to maintain tissue viability, is now inadequate and results in tissue loss or gangrene.9 Patients with ischemia present with reduced or absent pulses, skin that is thin, shiny and pale, a lack of hair growth and thickened toenails.

Risk Assessment: 1.1. Patients who present with a familial history of venous ulceration, varicosities, lower limb trauma or deep venous thrombosis should have a lower limb assessment done. Apply compression hosiery if his/her circulatory status is adequate, as preventive treatment for lower limb ulceration. Strength of Evidence = C (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) Strength of Evidence = C (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) Strength of Evidence = C 1.2. Elderly patients, those who smoke, and persons with diabetes are at high risk of arterial disease. Professional toenail care is a component of a preventive program in these high-risk individuals. Teaching regarding appropriately tting footwear to protect against trauma, avoidance of heat sources and management of high blood pressure are all important in restricting the risk of limb loss. Strength of Evidence = C (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) Strength of Evidence = C (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) Strength of Evidence = C Assessment History and Physical Assessment2. History and Physical Assessment: 2.1. Assessment and clinical investigations should be undertaken by healthcare professional(s) trained and experienced in leg ulcer management. Strength of Evidence = C Pearl of Wisdom: A complete assessment precedes evaluation of the limb and ulcer characteristics. A comprehensive assessment is essential to determine the underlying ulcer etiology and appropriate treatment approaches.PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS 2.2. A comprehensive clinical history and physical examination including blood pressure measurement, weight, laboratory data (CBC, urea, Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) should be recorded for a client presenting with either their rst or recurrent leg ulcer and should be annual thereafter. Vascular lab data should be included if available. Strength of Evidence = C 2.3. Information relating to ulcer history should be documented in a structured format. Strength of Evidence = C An ulcer history should include: The rst year the ulcer occurred; Site of ulcer and of any previous ulcers; Number of previous episodes of ulceration; Length of time taken to heal in previous episodes; Length of time with no recurrence of ulcers; Past treatment methods (both successful and unsuccessful); Previous operations on venous and arterial system; and, Previous and current use of compression hosiery.Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006D-16 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-16 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines 2.4. Examine both legs and record the following signs and symptoms to aid in the assessment of the underlying wound etiology: Ulcer size and depth (measure longest length in cm, measure widest point (width) at 90 degrees to length, measure greatest depth in cm); Wound base; and, Gangrene. Strength of evidence = C See Lower Limb Appendix A: Leg Ulcer Measurement Tool (LUMT) Note: Lower limb ulcers are not staged the same as pressure ulcers but are referred to as: Partial thickness wound - equivalent to the depth of a stage 2 pressure ulcer; Full thickness wound - equivalent to a stage 3 or 4 pressure ulcer. Pearl of Wisdom: Where there is mixed venous/arterial etiology, there may be features of venous ulceration in combination with signs of arterial impairment. Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-17 Lower Limb Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-17 2.5. Measure the surface areas of ulcers, at regular intervals, to monitor progress. Maximum length and width, or tracings onto a transparency are useful methods. Strength of Evidence = B 2.6. The client's estimate of the quality of life should be included in the initial discussion of the treatment plan, throughout the course of treatment, and when the ulcer has healed. Strength of Evidence = C 2.7. Assess the functional, cognitive and emotional status of the client and family to manage self-care. Strength of Evidence = C 2.8. Regular ulcer assessment is essential to monitor treatment effectiveness and healing healing goals. Strength of Evidence = C Pearl of Wisdom: If an ulcer is not progressing in a measurable way then several items must be reassessed: the treatment, the cause, local wound care, and client-related issues.10 Diagnostic Evaluation3. Diagnostic Evaluation: 3.1. A combination of clinical examination and measurement of a reliably taken Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) most commonly detect venous and arterial disease of the leg. Strength of Evidence = A See Lower Limb Appendix B: Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) Procedure 3.2. Doppler ultrasound measurement of Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) should be done by practitioners trained to undertake this measure. Strength of Evidence = B 3.3. If there are no signs of chronic venous insuf ciencyvenous insuf ciency and the Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) is abnormal (greater than 1.2 or less than 0.8), arterial etiology should be assumed and a vascular opinion sought . Strength of evidence = C 3.4. An ABPI < 0.5 indicates severe arterial insuf ciency; wound healinghealing unlikely unless revascularization can be done.9 Strength of Evidence = B (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) 3.5. An ABPI of 0.6-0.8 indicates mixed arterial/venous etiology and modi ed compression may be warranted.9 Strength of evidence = C (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) Strength of evidence = C (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) Strength of evidence = C Pearl of Wisdom: If ABPI is 0.9 further investigation is warranted to rule out arterial insuf ciency.11 Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006D-18 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-18 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines 3.6. Vascular assessment, such as Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) is recommended for ulcers in lower extremities, prior to debridement , to rule out vascular compromise. Strength of Evidence =C 3.7. Vascular assessment, such as Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) is recommended for ulcers in lower extremities, prior to initiation of moist wound healinghealing , to rule out vascular compromise. Strength of Evidence = C Ulcer care Cleansing and Debridement4. Cleansing and Debridement : 4.1. Choose the technique of debridement , considering the type, quantity and location of non-viable tissue, the depth of the wound, the amount of wound fl uid, and the general condition and goals of the client. Strength of Evidence =C Sharp debridementSharp debridement is a high-risk procedure Sharp debridement is a high-risk procedure Sharp debridement . This procedure requires specialized training for nurses. Wound debridement is contraindicated for the patient receiving debridement is contraindicated for the patient receiving debridement anticoagulant therapy, no palpable pulses or with an ABPI of <0.5. 4.2. Cleansing of the ulcer should be kept simple; warm tap water or saline is usually suf cient. Strength of Evidence = C 4.3. Moist wound cleansing, using saline or warm tap water, is only indicated if circulation is adequate to support healinghealing , and should be done at each dressing change. Strength of Evidence = C (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) Strength of Evidence = C (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) Strength of Evidence = C 4.4. Arterial wounds ( inadequate circulation to support healinghealing ) can be cleaned with water or saline to remove excess debris but never soaked or irrigated. Strength of Evidence = C (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) Strength of Evidence = C (HQC Committee Consensus, 2006) Strength of Evidence = C Pearl of Wisdom: For clients with an ABPI of < 0.5 (arterial ulcer) do not use the principles of moist wound healing. Dry out the wound with Betadine or Cicatrin powder. 4.5. Do not use cytotoxic skin cleansers or antisepticantiseptic agents (e.g., povidine iodine, iodophor, sodium hypochlorite solution [Dakin's], hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid) to clean wounds with healthy, granulating tissue. Strength of Evidence = B 4.6. Cleanse wounds initially and at each dressing change. Strength of Evidence = C Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-19 Lower Limb Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-19 4.7. To reduce surface bacteria and tissue trauma, the wound should be gently irrigated with 100 to 500 ml of solution. Strength of Evidence = C 4.8. Use enough irrigationirrigation pressure to enhance wound cleansing without causing trauma to the wound bed. Safe and effective ulcer- irrigationirrigation pressures range from 4 to 15 psi. Pressure of 4 to 15 psi is achieved by using a 35 ml syringe with a 19 gauge angiocath, or single-use, 100 milliliter saline-squeeze bottle. Strength of Evidence = B Dressings 5. Dressings: 5.1. Dressings must be simple, low adherent, acceptable to the client and should be low cost. Strength of Evidence = A See General Appendix G: Dressing Selection Criteria 5.2. Avoid products that commonly cause skin sensitivity, such as those containing lanolin, phenol alcohol, or topical antibioticstopical antibiotics . Strength of Evidence = C See General Appendix D: Potential Allergens 5.3. Refer clients with suspected sensitivity reactions to a dermatologist for patch testing. Following patch testing, identi ed allergens must be avoided, and medical advice on treatment should be sought. Strength of Evidence = B 5.4. Choose a type of dressing depending on the amount of exudate and the phase of healing. Strength of Evidence = C 5.5. No speci c dressing has been demonstrated to encourage ulcer healing. Strength of Evidence = A 5.6. In contrast to drying out, moist wound conditions allow optimal cell migration, proliferationproliferation , differentiation, and neovascularization. Strength of Evidence = A Pearl of Wisdom: Avoid wound cleansers that may be cytotoxic to granulating tissue.

Strength of Evidence = A Signs and symptoms of infection : Infl ammation/redness/ cellulites;cellulites; Increased pain; Purulent exudate;exudate; and, Pyrexia. Pearl of Wisdom: All wounds are colonized by bacteria, but most do not become infected. In chronic wounds, with adequate circulation, an infection should be suspected if the wound does not begin to show signs of healing after two (2) weeks of optimal treatment. Pearl of Wisdom: Because the ischemic wound is less able to mount an infl ammatory responseinfl ammatory response , clinical signs of infection may be more subtle.12 9.2. An infection is indicated when >105bacteria/gram tissue is present. Strength of Evidence = B 9.3. To obtain a wound culture using the swab technique, cleanse wound with normal saline rst. Swab wound bed, not eschar, exudate or edges. Applying rm pressure, rotate swab in wound bed. Strength of Evidence = C (HQC Consensus Panel, 2006) 9.4.

Evaluators should note the exudate type and amount on removal of dressings. Whenever possible, the time since the last dressing change should be consistent from one assessment to next. A1. Exudate type - Reminder: Some wound care products may change the appearance of the exudate, e.g., silver sulfadiazine or hydrocolloids. De nitions: 1 Serosanguinous - thin watery pale red to pink 2 Serous - thin watery clear pale yellowish 3 Seropurulent - thin opaque 4 Purulent - thick opaque yellow to green with foul odour (as distinct from body or foot odour) A2. Exudate amount - Reminder: Consider time since last dressing change. 0 None - ulcer healed or wound tissue dry (if wound dressings changes are not regular) 1 Scant - wound bed moist with dressing dry 2 Small - wound bed moist with some drainage on dressing 3 Moderate - obvious fl uid in wound bed and >50% of dressing soaked 4 Copious - overwhelming the dressing system A3. Size - Measure length as the longest diameter; width is perpendicular to length. Avoid diagonals. Calculate wound area as length by width. Write this in space provided and select appropriate response category. NOT A4. Depth - layers. Pick the most appropriate descriptor. A5. Undermining - Place moistened rayon-tipped sterile applicator or wound probe under the edge of the wound. Advance it gently as far as it will go. Place gloved thumb on the applicator against the wound edge to mark the extent of undermining on the applicator. Holding the thumb in place, remove the applicator and measure the distance along the applicator in centimetres. Indicate the area of greatest undermining according to the face of a clock with 12 o'clock at the top of the patient. A6. Necrotic tissue type - Reminder: The wound should be thoroughly cleansed before evaluating. Pick the predominant type of necrotic tissue, e.g., if most of the wound bed is attached brin with small amount of black eschar, choose attached brin as tissue type. A7. Necrotic tissue amount of predominant type selected in A6. The sum of the percentages in A7 and A9 may be less than but should not exceed 100%. A8. Granulation tissue type - Choose predominant type of granulation tissue. A9. Granulation tissue amount - (The sum of the percentages in A7 and A9 may be less than but should not exceed 100%.) The percentage of granulation tissue refers only to the non-epithelialized (open) portion of the wound. The advancing border of epithelium is not considered part of the wound surface. 90 l Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006D-32 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-32 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines A10.

Step 2 Secure the appropriate size blood pressure cuff around the arm (paediatric or oversized cuffs may be indicated). Apply ultrasound gel over brachial pulse. Slowly move the DopplerDoppler probe at a 45-degree angle to the fl ow over area until a good signal is obtained. Infl ate the cuff until DopplerDoppler signal disappears, then gradually release the pressure valve until the signal returns. This is the brachial systolic pressure. Measure the brachial pressure on both arms. Use the higher of the two measurements. This is the brachial systolic pressure. Step 3 Examine the foot for and dorsalis pedis pulses using ngers and/or DopplerDoppler probe. Step 4 Secure the blood pressure cuff just above the ankle. Locate the dorsalis pedis pulse using DopplerDoppler probe and gel. Infl ate the cuff until the signal disappears then gradually release the pressure valve until the signal returns. Repeat this process using the posterior tibial pulse. The higher of the two measurements is the ankle systolic pressure. Step 5 To calculate the ABPI, divide the ankle systolic pressure by the brachial systolic pressure. Caution: Unusually high readings may be obtained in elderly or diabetic patients as the cuff may not fully compress the calci ed vessel.

Worldwide Wounds and Wound Care Guidelines D-35 Lower Limb Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-35 LOWER LIMB ULCERS APPENDIX C Errors in Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) Measurement 1. Not enough gel: Air is a poor conductor of ultrasound. Gel must be used in order to achieve excellent sound quality. 2. Wrong cuff selection: A cuff that is too small will falsely increase pressures on a large arm, up to 40 mmHg, therefore decreasing the ABPI and falsely indicating disease. 3. Probe pressure: Too much pressure on the foot and ankle can obliterate the fl ow signal. 4. One ankle pressure measurement: At least two of the three pedal vessels must be measured. With Metabolic Pattern Distal Disease the dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, and peroneal pulses may all be different. One vessel may produce tissue risk, while the others are normal. Reporting tissue risk based on only one compromised vessel when there is normal fl ow in the other two vessels may result in unnecessary, more expensive, and invasive studies. 5. Improper foot position: Plantar fl exion may pulse. The posterior tibial pulse may be missed if there is a lot of adipose tissue or edema . Dorsifl ex the foot slightly to better hear the signals. 6. Only one arm BP measurement: Two measurements must always be taken. In the presence of vessel stenosis, the ABPI may appear normal if only the pressure from the diseased arm is used. Always use the highest blood pressure for the ABPI determination. 7. Probe movement: The probe may slip on and off the artery due to cuff infl ation or an unsteady hand causing an underestimate of the systolic reading. Move distal to the cuff and rest your hand on something. To keep your hand steady, assistance with infl ation of the cuff may be required. 8. Position: The patient should always be supine. Leg elevation may result in a reading that does not place the patient out of tissue risk and non-healing status on the basis of gravity. Please note on the chart when elevation is necessary and alert the physician. 9. Too rapid BP assessment: The opening systolic beats may be missed if the cuff is defl ated too quickly. Take two or three readings, slowly, in the same vessel, especially with patients who have arrhythmia. If the BP measurement needs to be repeated, remove the cuff and wait 2-3 minutes before re-infl ating the cuff. 10. Poor cuff placement : The bladder should be placed over the artery. At times, it may be dif cult to obliterate arterial fl ow. This may suggest calci ed vessels.Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006D-36 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-36 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines LOWER LIMB ULCERS APPENDIX D Compression Hosiery Low Compression Hosiery Brand Name Compression (mmHG) Style Airway Plus15 or 18 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Pantyhose Jobst for Men8 to 15 mmHg & 15 to 20 mmHgKnee high Jobst Sensifoot8 to 15 mmHg Knee high Sigvaris: Samson/Delilah15 to 20 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Pantyhose Venosan Legline15 to 20 mmHg Knee high Moderate Compression Hosiery Brand Name Compression (mmHG) Style Airway Plus22 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Pantyhose Jobst20 to 30 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Jobst Relief 20 to 30 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Waist high Open and closed toe Sigvaris Sculpture18 to 25 mmHg Pantyhose only Sigvaris 230 Cotton Series & Sigvaris 770 Series 20 to 30 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Open and closed toe Venosan Supportline18 to 22 mmHg Knee high (men and women) Venosan Ultraline 400120 to 30 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Open and closed toe Pantyhose (regular & maternity)Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-37 Lower Limb Ulcers Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-37 High Compression Hosiery Brand Name Compression (mmHG) Style Jobst for Men 30 to 40 mmHg Knee high Jobst Relief 30 to 40 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Waist high Open and closed toeOpen and closed toe Jobst Ultrasheer (Ladies)30 to 40 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Pantyhose (regular & maternity) Sigvaris 230 Cotton Series 30 to 40 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Open and closed toe Sigvaris 500 Series 770 Series 860 Series30 to 40 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Open and closed toe Pantyhose (regular & maternity) Venosan Ultraline 4002 30 to 40 mmHgKnee high (men and women) Thigh high (men and women) Open and closed toe Pantyhose (regular & maternity)Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006D-38 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-38 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines D-39 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, May 2007 LOWER LIMB ULCERS APPENDIX E Compression Products SAHO PRODUCTS Description Indicators for use Considerations Profore 4-layer compression bandage composed of a cotton roll, crepe, and flexible cohesive bandage that compresses at 30-40 mmHg pressure when applied stasis ulcer management.

E58Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-5 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-5 Introduction Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of an intelligent effort. - John Ruskin, English essayist (1819-1900) A wealth of research evidence shows that simply distributing best practice guidelines does not lead to better patient outcomes or improved quality of care. Successful adoption and implementation of these guidelines will require a carefully planned and well-executed strategy. It is our hope that this Implementation Guide will serve as a useful reference in planning and carrying out your implementation strategy. In the summer of 2004, the HQC invited acute care, home care, and long-term care facilities across the province to participate in an HQC-sponsored pilot project to implement the Saskatchewan Pressure Ulcer Guideline. The objectives of this pilot project were to: Test an evidence-based implementation strategy; Evaluate the impact of implementing the pressure ulcers guideline on the incidence and prevalence of pressure ulcers; Identify the barriers and facilitators to implementation and identify strategies most effective in overcoming barriers; and Evaluate the structure and content of the pressure ulcers guideline. Six long-term care facilities and one mixed acute/long-term care facility were chosen to participate in the project: Central Haven Special Care Home, Saskatoon; Estevan Regional Nursing Home; Parkland Place, Village, Saskatoon; Joseph's Hospital, Estevan; and St. Paul Lutheran Home, Melville. Between November 2004 and September 2005, the HQC supported these facilities' efforts to incorporate the pressure ulcer guideline into their daily practice. The HQC designed and supported an evidence-based implementation strategy that included establishing local interdisciplinary wound care committees, and providing training and ongoing clinical support. Insights from the pilot project inspired the development of this Implementation Guide, designed to serve as a starting point for teams implementing the Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines. Drawing on quality improvement literature, it provides tips, tools and templates that can be used by teams in their improvement efforts. It is not, however, intended to be a recipe or \"one size ts all\" approach to implementation; users of this guide are encouraged to be innovative and to test and evaluate their own implementation strategies. It was designed for use in long-term, acute, and home care settings. Each team will have its own unique challenges and circumstances. No one strategy can address them all, but we hope that this guide will be a helpful starting point. Several tools and templates are provided on the accompanying CD. Feel free to adapt these to meet your own needs. We wish you all the best as you embark on this exciting and challenging quality improvement journey. We welcome any feedback on the Implementation Guide, and invite you to visit our website for additional quality improvement tools: www.hqc.sk.c a.

These boxes are similar to the pearls of wisdom found throughout the guidelines, and are intended to share the challenges, highlights and lessons learned from the pilot site experience. Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-7 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-7 Getting StartedSaskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-8 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-8 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines THE MODEL FOR IMPROVEMENT All improvement involves change, not all change is an improvement. Making changes to the way that we do things can be time-consuming and can sometimes feel risky. The Model for Improvement (Langley et al., 1996) is a tried and tested approach to achieving successful change. Use of the model offers the following bene ts: It is a simple approach that anyone can apply; It reduces risk by starting small; and, It is highly effective. The Model for Improvement The model provides a framework for developing, testing and implementing changes that will lead to improvement. The model consists of two parts that are of equal importance. The rst, the 'thinking part', consists of three fundamental questions that are essential for guiding improvement work. The second part, the 'doing part', is made up of Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles that will help you make rapid change. The three fundamental questions for achieving improvement A planned approach to improving things will give you a better chance of being successful. The three fundamental questions for achieving improvement are a useful way of framing your work. When you have completed your Quality Improvement (QI) Charter, you will have answered the rst two questions. 1. What are we trying to accomplish? This question is intended to help you be clear about the improvements that you would like to make, what results you would like to get and how you would like things to be different. Having a clear aim is crucial. 2. How will we know that a change is an improvement? Without measurement it is impossible to know whether you have improved. Think about how you want things to be different when you have implemented your change and agree what data you need to collect to measure it. 3. What changes can we make that can lead to an improvement? Finally, you need to decide what changes you will try in order to achieve the results you are looking for. Change ideas may come from: evidence/ best practices; other teams that have made improvements; team member hunches; and analysis of your current processes (see Facility Self-Assessment Tool, and Process Mapping). You can adapt ideas from elsewhere or be completely creative. Gather together as many ideas as you can. These will form the basis for the next step - your PDSA cycles (see PDSA Cycles on page E-32). Figure 2: The Model for Improvement What are we trying to accomplish? How will we know that a change is an improvement? What changes can we make that will result in improvement?

A clear, measurable, time-speci c aim statement helps focus and guide the team's efforts. Example: Within 8 months, the incidence of new pressure ulcers developed in our facility will be zero. Objectives In order to meet your aim, your team will identify 2-3 priority improvement areas. For each area, you will identify a speci c objective. Example: Within 6 months, 100% of at-risk residents will have a pressure-ulcer- prevention-plan in their care plan. Clinical Leader Recognized and respected member of the community who is seen as knowledgeable and credible by clinical peers. He or she understands the processes of care, is willing to try new ideas, adapt an innovation to the local situation, and demonstrate its relative advantage over an existing practice. Ideally, your team's clinical leader will have a personal interest or specialized training in wound care, and some prior experience implementing best practice guidelines. Team Sponsor The person or team in the organization that provides the resources for the charter, minimizes organizational obstacles to the effort, and keeps senior management apprised of progress. The team sponsor's role and communication preferences should be clari ed early in the improvement project. Team Members Quality improvement in health care requires teamwork. Consider the aim of your improvement effort when determining team composition. Be explicit about roles and expectations for team members. See \"Team Composition\". Scope What speci c part(s) of the improvement process will this team be responsible for (e.g., planning, implementing, evaluating, monitoring)? How will the team know when its work is done? What are the key \"deliverables\"? Measures Only through measurement can teams determine whether a change is an improvement. Teams should have at least one outcome measure (what is better for the patient?), one process measure (what is better about provision of care?), and one balancing measure (what is the impact of the changes on other parts of the system?). See \"Measurement for Improvement.\" Key Stakeholders Those individuals and groups who have an infl uence on the change initiative, may be affected by the outcomes, or share an interest in the project and would like to be informed of its progress and outcomes. Examples of stakeholders include: patients, family members, staff and care providers, facility and regional managers. Timeframe Specify a beginning and end date. You may also choose to identify milestones to review. Meetings Specify the purpose, frequency, and types of meetings your team will conduct. Meeting types may include: traditional face-to-face meetings, team huddles, and/or teleconferences. See \"running a meeting.\" Clarify expectations regarding attendance & participation. Constraints Identify any boundaries or limitations that may impact this improvement effort. Constraints may include nancial or human resource limitations, or parts of the system that have to stay as they are. Resources Does the team have a budget (e.g., for meeting expenses)? Who will approve expenditures? Who can the team turn to for expert guidance and coaching on improvement?Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-15 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-15 Facility Self-Assessment Tool for Pressure Ulcer Care: Instructions The purpose of this tool is to help front line QI teams identify priority improvement areas for pressure ulcer care. Pilot site coordinators indicated that one of the most dif cult aspects of implementing the pressure ulcer guidelines was deciding where to begin. This tool is intended to provide assistance in making that decision. Each item on the tool is a best practice recommendation from the Saskatchewan Pressure Ulcer Guidelines. After completing the tool, teams should be able to: 1. Identify 2-3 priority improvement areas for pressure ulcer care; and, 2. Set a speci c objective for each priority improvement area. Instructions for using the tool: 1. As a team, answer each question by circling the number that best describes current practices in your facility. Those most familiar with day-to-day practice in the facility should be included in the self- assessment process, including all members of your front line QI team. 2. When the team has answered all of the questions, go back and identify areas for improvement. Items that are scored as \"never\" or \"some of the time\" are considered areas for improvement, and are indicated by shaded grey boxes on the tool. 3. List the areas for improvement in order of priority. High priority areas may include the most pressing or most promising (i.e., those that show the greatest room for improvement, or those that would be relatively easy to change and could, therefore, lead to a \"quick win\"). 4. Choose the top 2-3 priority improvement areas. Set a speci c objective for each priority improvement area. Enter these objectives into your Quality Improvement Charter. 5. As a team, use the tool on a regular basis to re-assess, monitor your progress, and identify areas for future improvement efforts.Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-16 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-16 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Facility Self-Assessment Tool for Pressure Ulcer Care Date: ______________________ As a team, answer each question by circling the number that best describes current practices in your facility.

For each area, specify your objective for that area. For example: Within 6 months, 100% of at-risk residents will have a pressure ulcer prevention plan in their care plan. Enter these objectives into your Quality Improvement Charter. Priority Improvement Area ObjectiveSaskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-20 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-20 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Process Mapping To determine where you are going on your improvement journey, you must rst determine where you are. In other words, a clear understanding of your current processes will reveal the most promising, and most pressing, improvement opportunities. What is a process? Processes are a series of connected steps or actions that achieve an outcome. A process can be short and simple, or it can be long and complex, but every process has a de ned beginning and end. For example, a process might begin with the symptom and end with resumption of good health. Similarly, a process might begin with the request for an x-ray and end with the result. Process Mapping A process map is a picture of the sequence of steps in a process. The following tips may help your team map their own processes: De ne the scope: where does this process begin and where does it end? Include everyone who takes part in the process from start to nish, including patients and care providers. No one person knows the entire process; Identify steps from the patient/customer's perspective; Focus on what happens to 80% of the patients 80% of the time. Avoid mapping what \"should\" happen, or what happens in rare or exceptional cases; Pay particular attention to all steps involving a hand-off, when information or work moves from one individual or group to another (e.g., from acute care to long-term care, from physician to nurse) - handoff areas are prone to errors and confusion; Determine the purpose or intended use of the process map - this will help you decide on the level of detail required; Respect all contributions; Raise issues and questions; and, Do not assign blame. Creating your map: Using a whiteboard or sticky notes, write down each step in the process. Do not leave out a single step; For each step, write down the task and the name of the person(s) who carries out that task; and, Arrange the steps in order, but feel free to add new steps and move steps around at any point. Analyzing the Process Map Once the process is mapped, it is time for your team to critically analyze it. Depending on your improvement objectives, you may identify ways to make this process safer, quicker, error-free, cost-effective, and/or streamlined (logical fl ow, fewer delays and hand-offs). Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-21 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-21 For each step, answer these questions: Can it be eliminated? Can it be done in some other way? Can it be done in a different order? Can it be done somewhere else? Can it be done in parallel? Can any \"bottlenecks\" be removed? Who is responsible? Is it being done by the most appropriate person?Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-22 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-22 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Measurement for Improvement All improvement involves change, not all change is an improvement. So, how will we know that a change is an improvement? Only through measurement can teams determine whether a change actually made things better. Improvement teams should regularly monitor a family of measures: outcome, process, and balancing measures. Outcome Measures Outcome measures answer the question: what is better for the patient? These measures are typically amenable to counting and can often be measured using a standard tool. Examples of outcome measures include: incidence of pressure ulcers, scores on a risk scale, number of infections. Process Measures Process measures answer the question: what is better about the way care is delivered? These measures indicate whether the processes of care have improved. Examples of process measures include: integration of Braden Risk score into care plans, consistency of wound care practice and documentation. Balancing Measures Balancing measures answer the question: what in the system may be adversely affected by the changes? We cannot change one part of a system without infl uencing other parts in some way. Balancing measures help teams track the impact of their changes on other parts of the system, including unintended consequences. For example, if we start to regularly reposition patients at risk of developing a pressure-ulcer, we will want to monitor the impact of our intervention on patients (e.g., sleep, pain) and staff (e.g., workload, injuries). Measures should be: Useful - they needn't be perfect - measures should tell you whether the changes are having the desired impact; Simple - use existing sources of data whenever possible; any new measures should be easily incorporated into day-to-day work; Minimal - collect just enough data to satisfy the needs of the team; measurement should speed improvement, not slow it down; and, Real-time - routinely collect and present data to gauge progress and the continuing impact of the change. Measurement can be a powerful tool for stimulating and sustaining improvements. Pilot site pearl: The HQC was responsible for collecting data from the sites (e.g., Braden Risk Assessments and wound records), analyzing it, and sharing summary results with the sites. In hindsight, we would encourage local data collection, analysis and synthesis. Teams who develop and monitor their own measures are in a much better position to identify improvement opportunities and assess their own progress. Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-23 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-23 Building your Front Line Quality Improvement TeamSaskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-24 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-24 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Team Composition Interdisciplinary team approach : Including the right people on your front line QI Team is critical to any successful improvement effort. Recruit staff and care providers from all aspects of the patient experience; each discipline brings a unique perspective on the processes of care involved in preventing and managing wounds. Depending on local resources, your committee may include nursing staff, special care aides, physicians, occupational therapists, physical therapists, nutritionists, dietitians, recreational therapists, social workers, and materials management personnel. Team size: It is important to consider size when developing QI teams. A team that is too large may have dif culty coordinating schedules for meetings, and meetings may involve lengthy discussions and little consensus. On the other hand, a team that is too small may be missing representation from key groups, and might feel overwhelmed by having to accomplish so many tasks with so few resources. The optimal team size is between 6 and 12 members. Pilot site pearl: In some facilities, the Wound Care Committee provided their rst formal opportunity to have members of different departments and disciplines share their expertise. Members appreciated having their contributions to skin and wound care recognized, and being included in the improvement process. For example, in several sites, special care aides became QI champions once their critical role in the prevention of pressure ulcers was highlighted. Wound care committees helped build relationships and understanding across departments by facilitating the sharing of both information and resources. One facility found that having someone from materials management on their Wound Care Committee facilitated their efforts to standardize and acquire skin and wound care products (e.g., dressings, cleansers, lotions). Another site found that the occupational therapist on their committee was integral to acquiring new support surfaces and cushions. Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-25 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-25 10 Essential Ingredients for a Successful Team Although confl ict is to be expected in any team, some common group dif culties can be prevented when teams ensure they have the following essential ingredients: 1. Clarity in Team Goals A team works best when everyone understands its purpose and goals. If there is confusion or disagreement about goals, effective teams work to resolve the issues and reach consensus. 2. Established Ground Rules Highly effective teams outline how they will work together and establish behavioural expectations for team members. For example, ground rules may include: we will start and nish meetings on time; we will value diversity of opinion in the group & respect each person's contribution. 3. A Work Plan Successful teams outline who will do what when. Clear action plans help the team identify what resources, materials or training are needed throughout the project so that they can plan accordingly. Work plans also fl ag uneven distribution of tasks among team members. 4. Clearly De ned Roles Teams operate most ef ciently if they tap everyone's talents and all members understand their duties and know who is responsible for what issues and tasks. Roles may need to be re-visited periodically (e.g., as new tasks come to light, member workloads shift etc.). For example, the team recorder will summarize discussion outcomes and action items, and distribute the notes to team members. 5. Balanced Participation One or two members taking responsibility for the team's efforts is neither effective nor sustainable. All members should participate in discussions and decisions, share commitment to the project's success, and contribute their talents. 6. Open Communication Effective teams share information, thoughts and ideas in an open and direct manner. Team members seek to understand one another's perspectives. 7. Bene cial Team Behaviours Teams should encourage all members to make discussions and meetings more effective by initiating discussion, listening to others, working through confl ict, etc. 8. Established Decision-Making Methods Teams should be aware of the different ways they reach decisions, and the consequences of using those methods. For example, when the designated leader makes the decision, others may not fully understand the decision or feel committed to implementing it. 9. Experimentation/ Creativity An effective team experiments with different ways of doing things and is creative in its approach. 10. Evaluation Teams need to regularly evaluate both their functioning and their accomplishments.

Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-26 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-26 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Pilot site pearl: At most pilot site facilities, the team coordinator often felt overwhelmed by the demands of the pilot project because responsibilities were not adequately shared among all of the Wound Care Committee members, and other staff were often reluctant to actively participate in the improvements. When asked what advice they would offer to other facilities implementing these new guidelines, team coordinators emphatically offered this caution: one person cannot be solely responsible for promoting the change! They suggested that if they could do it over again, they would spend more time in their early team meetings establishing, as a team, who would be responsible for which components of the improvement project so that members were clear about their roles and their assigned responsibilities. Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-27 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-27 Running a Successful Meeting or Teleconference Useful Meeting Types Team meetings are an important part of a quality improvement project. Holding both traditional and informal meetings (known as \"huddles\") will help move your project forward. Both meeting styles are useful, but one may be more appropriate than the other based on the goals of the meeting and the time constraints often faced within interdisciplinary teams. Traditional Meetings: A traditional meeting is useful when there is a set amount of time for an in-depth discussion aimed at reaching a speci c goal. This type of meeting is especially useful for refl ecting on your current processes, setting improvement goals, and evaluating team progress. These meetings are typically between one and two hours in length and have a set agenda. These meetings can be face-to-face, by teleconference, or a combination of the two. Keys to successful meetings: 1. Be clear about the purpose Is the purpose to generate discussion, agree on actions, or both? Clarity about the purpose will help establish the aims of the meeting and questions that need to be raised. 2. Participant selection Prior to the meeting decide which key people need to be invited (see \"Team Composition\"). Depending on the purpose of the meeting, you may invite people outside of your core improvement team (e.g., senior leadership representative, additional staff members). 3. Logistics It is important to clarify the dates, times and locations of meetings in advance so that team members can con rm their availability. 4. The agenda as a planning tool Distribute the agenda and any supporting material in advance of the meeting. The agenda can be used as a planning tool and should outline the goals of the meeting and the proposed structure. This will help those involved prepare for the meeting (see Agenda Template). 5. Running the meeting Be sure to establish the chair prior to the meeting. The chair is responsible for moving the agenda along, generating discussion, and encouraging group participation. The role of chair may be shared among team members. Discussion outcomes and action items (including timelines and person responsible) should be summarized and documented during the meeting. 6. After the meeting Distribution of meeting notes within a day or two will help maintain momentum. Adapted with permission from: Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care.

Because huddles are more informal than traditional meetings, they can occur more frequently. They allow for greater participation of front line staff, who often cannot arrange schedules to attend longer meetings. They are great for keeping the momentum going. Keys to successful huddles: Discuss the huddle concept with the team and explain how huddles can be used to speed improvement; Agree on a time and place where regular huddles will occur; Choose a huddle location that is convenient for the team members, particularly those who have the least time available for meetings; Have a clear set of objectives for every huddle; Limit the duration of the huddle to 15 minutes or less; Review the objectives of the huddle for that day, review the work done since the last huddle, act on the new information, and plan next steps; and, Huddle frequently -- daily or weekly -- particularly when many small changes are being tested and the team needs to share information frequently. Pilot site pearl: Teams found that members were more likely to attend, and actively participate in, team meetings when the agenda was clear and the discussion was focused. Shorter, more frequent meetings accelerated their improvement efforts.

Once you have decided exactly what you want to achieve, you can use PDSA cycles to test out your ideas developed from the third question, 'What changes can we make that will lead to an improvement?' The key to PDSA cycles is to try out your change on a small scale to begin with and to rely on using many consecutive cycles to build up information about how effective your change is. This makes it easier to get started, gives results rapidly and reduces the risk of something going wrong and having a major impact. If what you try doesn't work as well as you hoped, you can always try a different idea, or go back to the way you did things before. When you have built up enough information to feel con dent about your change, you can then implement and spread it throughout your system. Practicalities People have a tendency to jump straight to solutions rather than really work out what the root of the problem is. If you use the three fundamental questions, it will help you be sure that you are dealing with the issue that really needs to be addressed. When you plan your cycle, make sure you are clear about who is doing what, where and when. Your results are dependent on how good your plan is. We have included a worksheet that you may nd useful.(see page E-33) Discuss what you think will happen when you try out your change. What is your hunch? When you have carried out the cycle, compare your expectations with what actually happened. You may learn something interesting about how things work in your system. Record your PDSA as you go along: the plan, the results, what you learned and what you are going to do next. Not only is it very motivating to see the results of what you have tried, it is also a great way of accumulating information about your systems and a good way of sharing your learning with other people. Use PDSAs consecutively to build up the information about your change and then use them to implement it systematically into your daily work. PDSA cycles generally do not operate in isolation - you should expect to have a series of them leading towards your objective. And nally.... PDSAs cannot be too small One PDSA will almost always lead to one or more others You can achieve rapid results They help you to be thorough and systematic They help you learn from your work Anyone can use them in any areaThe PDSA Cycle for Improvement Act Plan Study Do- What changes are to be made? - Next cycle?- Objective - Predictions - Plan to carry out the cycle (who, what, where, when) - Plan for data collection - Carry out the plan - Document observations - Record data- Analyse data - Compare results to predictions - Summarise what was learned Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-33 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-33 PDSA Cycle Planning & Progress Sheet Start Date End Date (estimated) PLAN What are we trying to learn or accomplish during this cycle?

Are there forces in our organization that will help or hinder those changes? Objective of next cycle?Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-34 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-34 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Diffusion of Improvements Your improvement team may be relieved to hear that it is not necessary to convince every stakeholder of the importance of your proposed changes. Widespread acceptance is not necessary for change to take place. If you convince 20 per cent of the staff and care providers to change, momentum will build and the change will follow. This is the \"tipping point\" and rests on the proven logic of the 20/80 rule: 20 percent of effort will yield 80 per cent of the result. Do not spend too much time on those individuals who won't change easily. The graph below illustrates the rate at which people accept change. It shows that in the beginning (as a change is introduced) a small number of Innovators will quickly see the value of a change and serve as early examples to others. Next, the change will be accepted by the Early Adopters who, based on the example of the Innovators, will see the bene t of trying something new. The majority of people fall in the middle of the graph, adopting the change in a great wave as it gains momentum. By now, more people have accepted the change than have not. Only a small percentage of people are Traditionalists or Laggards who still won't, and may never see, the value in doing something new. This graph can be applied to the adoption of cell phone technology. When cell phones were rst introduced, a small percentage of the population purchased one because they were Innovators; it didn't matter how much the new technology cost. As cell phones came down in price (and size), more people adopted the technology. The big bubble in the middle includes the majority of people who bought cell phones once they were quite common. Finally, the small group of Laggards may still not have and never plan to get a cell phone. All of us can identify times when we have been Innovators/Adopters of change and times when we have been Laggards. Our response varies according to the type of change being introduced, and how we feel about the status quo. In order to effect change, we need to understand the perceived bene ts and cost of maintaining the status quo , as well as the perceived bene ts and costs of making the change . We will adopt new ideas and practices only when the change becomes more important and more appealing than maintaining the status quo. Our response to change will be shaped, in part, by the following characteristics of the change: Relative advantage: What evidence is there that if I accept these ideas things will improve? Is it clear how these changes will make my work easier or more rewarding? Compatibility: How compatible is the idea with the current structure, organizational values, and culture? How compatible is the idea with my personal values? Simplicity: Can the idea be simply described or is it quite complex to understand? Testability: Can I test whether the idea might work for me, or if I make the change is it dif cult to reverse? Observability: If I make a change and adopt the ideas, will I see a difference? Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-35 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-35 Reactions to Change We are all somewhat uncomfortable with change because it can mean a time of loss and uncertainty. It is only natural that we want to have a sense of control. Our reactions to change might range from open resistance to commitment, depending on how the change is communicated and the circumstances surrounding the change. It is important that leaders of the change explain the why and how of the change. People need time to learn about changes, to understand why the changes are being made and how the change is going to affect them. Reactions to change may include: Resistance: When change is perceived as threatening, people may actively try to block the change; Apathy: Feeling or showing little or no interest in the change; Compliance: Implementing the change while privately disagreeing with the change; Conformance: Changing behaviour as a result of real or imagined group pressure; and, Commitment: Becoming bound emotionally and/or intellectually to the change; invested in making it happen. Some sort of reaction to change is to be expected, and leaders of the change should not view initial reactions as resistance. However, if these reactions are not properly dealt with, they can develop into full-blown resistance. Reducing resistance and gaining commitment: Provide information on why the change is needed; Design changes to make work easier or more rewarding; Provide speci c information on how the change will affect people; Be prepared to discuss questions, requests for clari cation, or ideas about the change; Test changes on a small scale; Involve those who will be affected by the change in developing and testing the change; Provide regular progress updates; Publicize the various people in the organization who are involved in developing and testing the change; Use the results from the testing cycles to share visual displays of data and test results; Empathize with the anxiety created by the change (but do not expect to eliminate it); Reframe the change as an exciting opportunity, not something being forced on people; Acknowledge and appreciate people's efforts; and, Get input from others on how to make the implementation successful: people have a tendency to support what they help to create! Pilot site pearl: Teams who introduced changes gradually (e.g., one unit at a time) found the implementation process more manageable. Those who tried to introduce a number of change ideas at once, throughout their whole facility, found their progress was slow and staff resistance was high. Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-36 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-36 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Gauging Readiness for Change You can gauge your organization's readiness for change by using Force Field Analysis. It views change as a struggle between driving forces, which propel change, and restraining forces, which slow or prevent change. Force Field Analysis The main vertical line represents the current situation. To the left, driving forces are pushing on the line. To the right, restraining forces are pushing back. To move the main line, we must increase the driving forces, decrease the restraining forces, or both. When implementing the Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, driving forces may include: organization has experience with successful improvement efforts, and the Clinical Lead is credible and infl uential among peers. Restraining forces may include: limited opportunities for cross-discipline communication, and concern that guidelines will restrict professional autonomy. If you can only change one factor, it is more effective to decrease the restraining forces than increase the driving forces. Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-37 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-37 Organizational Readiness Assessment Tool Use this assessment tool to tailor your team's implementation plan, taking advantage of the driving forces and addressing the restraining forces. Involve key stakeholders in this assessment. Element Question Driving Forces Restraining Forces Workplace Culture To what extent is the new wound care guideline consistent with the values, attitudes and beliefs of the practice environment? To what degree does the culture support change and value evidence?

Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-39 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-39 Communication Plan Your improvement efforts will affect, and be affected by, individuals and groups outside of your core improvement team. It is important to keep these stakeholders informed, and invite their feedback, at all stages of the change initiative. Stakeholders who feel \"out of the loop\" may not support or implement the proposed changes. Your communication plan should outline who, what, when & how. Who - your target audiences (stakeholders) include those individuals and groups who have an infl uence on the change initiative, may be affected by the outcomes, or share an interest in the project and would like to be informed of its progress and outcomes. Note that your approach (\"what, when and how\") may vary, depending on your target audience. Examples of stakeholders include the following: Patients/Clients/Residents; Family members; Staff and care providers; Senior leaders; Facility and regional managers; and, Community members. What - key messages are clear and succinct statements of a message that your team wants target audiences to receive. Fleshed-out versions of these key messages will appear in your communication tools. Examples of key messages include: Improvement aim; Priority improvement areas & related objectives; Pressure ulcers can be prevented; Use of consistent wound care practices speeds healing; An interdisciplinary team approach improves care; Members of the improvement team include...; We are working together to improve skin and wound care for patients/ clients/ residents; and, Your input is welcome. When - your plan should outline the proposed timing and frequency of communication with each target audience. How - choose methods or tools appropriate for the audience and the key messages. All materials should include contact information for one or two members of the improvement team who can provide additional information or address any questions/concerns. Examples of tools for communication include the following: Direct mail - post; Email; Printed materials materials; Resident chart; Communication book;Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-40 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-40 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Posters and newsletters; Special events (e.g., social activities); and, Direct contact.

[Online]. 2005 URL: http://www.safetyandquality.org/nmsbcimprovew2.pd f Pilot site pearl: Teams in larger facilities found it challenging to reach all of their staff to communicate changes and invite feedback. They realized that different strategies were needed to connect with full- time, part-time, and casual staff. These strategies included: attaching a note to employees' time sheets; making announcements at staff meetings and shift change reports; and informally connecting with staff during their shifts.

Strategies to integrate guidelines into practice in your setting; 2. Driving and restraining forces to integration of the guidelines; 3. Forming partnerships to foster guideline implementation across all disciplines; and, 4. Resource requirements, including time, space, materials, expertise, and nances. 1. Strategies to integrate guidelines into practice in your setting The rst step in educating staff about the new guidelines is to choose strategies to incorporate the guidelines into your practice setting. The strategies you choose will be based on the level of experience staff members have with the guidelines; some staff may already be familiar with them, while others may not have had any experience with them. Table 1 provides some examples of strategies that could be used to integrate the guidelines into practice. Table 1: Strategies for integrating guidelines into practice Educational exposure to guidelines Strategies for guideline integration Staff with knowledge of guidelines: Learned in basic education In-service exposure Post graduate courses with best practices in curriculum Encourage staff with knowledge of the guidelines to become champions. Involve champions in establishing/ running workshops. Have staff assess recommendations and decide how they can be implemented on their unit and identify how the guidelines t into their scope of practice. Nurses can work with unregulated care providers to identify how to integrate speci c recommendations into the daily care of clients. Staff without previous guideline knowledge Plan in-service education sessions to stimulate change in practice through implementation of a speci c guideline or speci c recommendations. Increase effectiveness by complementing in-service sessions with follow-up and integration of the guidelines in the workplace. 2. Driving and restraining forces to the integration of the guidelines An important step in planning an educational program is to identify factors that might help you put your plan into action (\"driving forces\") and factors that might hinder your plan (\"restraining forces\"). Identifying these factors in advance will help you anticipate problems that may arise during the implementation of your education plan and develop strategies to deal with them. A good way to visualize the driving and restraining forces and their effects on your education plan is to perform a Force Field Analysis. See \"Gauging Readiness for Change\" on page E-36.Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-45 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-45 3. Forming partnerships to foster guideline implementation across all disciplines Best practices for skin and wound care dictate that an interdisciplinary approach is required. To promote an interdisciplinary approach, it is important that the education plan includes strategies for collaboration with all disciplines involved in skin and wound care, including: special care aides, nurses, occupational therapists, physical therapists, dieticians, and physicians. Some strategies that could be used to help form interdisciplinary partnerships are: Workshops for all staff regarding plan for the adoption of the guidelines into unit practice; Appeal to the value of evidence-based practice and the role of best practice guidelines in supporting all disciplines; and, Encourage staff to become guideline champions. 4. Resource requirements The identi cation and allocation of resources is an essential step in the education plan. Several resources will be required, including time, space, materials, expertise and nances. Table 2 provides examples of resource questions that should be addressed in planning your education program. Table 2: Resource considerations for education planning Resource Questions to consider Time How available are learners - can they be released for one hour, for a half day, for a whole day? Are repeat sessions required? How will you deal with shift work and continuity? Do you have time for planning? Experiential learning takes more time than lectures - can you build in that time? Space How dif cult is it to book suitable rooms? Do the furnishings allow fl exibility? What is the optimum space? Materials What is possible within the space - e.g., is projection equipment available? What can be provided for those who cannot attend? Expertise What expertise (e.g., content, facilitation, implementation) is needed? What expertise is available? Finances Will nancing be needed for staff time, materials, room rental, honouraria for experts, and refreshments? Is there a budget? What are actual and \"in-kind\" budget requirements? Who can provide funding needed? Source: Registered Nurses Association of Ontario. Educator's resource: integration of best practice guidelines. Toronto (ON): Registered Nurses Association of Ontario; 2005.Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-46 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-46 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Pilot site pearl: Staff attendance at in-services was a challenge at all sites, but particularly for those sites that were not able to pay staff to attend training. When team coordinators were asked what they would do differently in future improvement efforts, they said they would include in their budget some funding for staff training. Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-47 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-47 Assessing Educators and Learners An essential step in planning education sessions is to assess the current knowledge, attitudes and practices of both educators (those who will be leading the sessions) and learners with respect to skin and wound care and the best practice guidelines. Assessing educators will help to determine their level of expertise with the guidelines and will affect the strategies used to assess, plan, implement and evaluate the education sessions. In addition, it will also help to determine whether the educators require additional training before they begin to teach others. Assessing learners will help to determine the educational needs of the staff. The results of this needs assessment will help determine what information is presented in the education sessions. They will also help to determine whether the information should be presented at a novice, intermediate, or advanced level. The HQC developed a Knowledge Survey to be used by pilot sites to conduct a learning needs assessment before their education sessions. This survey is speci c to pressure ulcer prevention and management (see page E-48). This tool could also be used to evaluate learning after education sessions and to identify gaps in knowledge to be addressed in future sessions. Feel free to copy or adapt this survey and use it as a needs assessment tool. Source: Registered Nurses Association of Ontario. Educator's reference: integration of best practice guidelines .

These are: 1) Timeline; 2) Topic; 3) Learning objectives; 4) Teaching methods; 5) Resources required; and, 6) Ongoing education. Timeline The timeline de nes the start and end point of the learning event. Topic The topic de nes the main theme of the learning event. For example, in the pilot sites, two separate in-service sessions were held to cover two separate topics: pressure ulcer prevention and pressure ulcer management. The topics addressed and content covered in the sessions will be determined by the results of the educator and learner needs assessment. For more information, please see \"Assessing Educators and Learners\" (see page E-47). Learning objectives The learning objectives describe what you expect attendees to learn from the learning event. There can be more than one learning objective for the event. For example, the following learning objectives might apply to a learning event on pressure ulcer prevention: 1. Able to perform a pressure ulcer risk assessment with the Braden scale. 2. Able to use a repositioning schedule to regularly reposition residents con ned to chair or bed. 3. Able to select and use appropriate products for pressure ulcer prevention (creams, cleansers, etc.). Teaching methods Individuals learn in different ways: visual learners retain new information by seeing, observing and writing; auditory learners prefer to talk and listen; and kinesthetic learners need to do, touch and be physically involved with their learning. It is likely that your learning event will include individuals with a mixture of learning styles; therefore, the learning event should incorporate a mixture of teaching methods that involve seeing, hearing and doing. Table 3 provides examples of teaching methods tailored to each learning style.Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-53 Implementation Guide Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-53 Table 3: Learning styles and teaching methods Learning style Teaching methods Seeing (Visual) Use graphics to help learning: books, lms, pictures, puzzles, videos, computer software Use colour coding to organize content Write directions Use fl ow charts and diagrams for note taking Visualize words and facts to be retained Hearing (Auditory) Use audio tapes, lms, records, videos, radio programs Participate in debates, seminars, group assignments Learn by reciting, discussing, interviewing, attending lectures Ask for oral explanations Doing (Kinesthetic) Memorize, drill, make decisions while walking or exercising Use concrete materials: models, lab equipment, subject- related games and puzzles, computer programs Take frequent breaks in study periods Learn by touching and doing Study by writing over and over In addition, interactive methods, which promote active learning by participants, promote greater information retention than methods that are not interactive. Some examples of teaching methods, in order of decreasing retention, are: lectures, reading, audio-visual, demonstration, discussion group, practice by doing, and teaching others/immediate use . Resources required Several different types of resources will be required to plan and carry out the learning event: time, space, materials, expertise and money. Some important resource questions to consider when planning the learning event are: How much time will be required to plan and prepare for the learning event? How long will the sessions be? How often will they be repeated? Where will the learning event be held? Does this space require advance booking? What materials (e.g., handouts, product samples) will be required? What equipment (e.g., computers, projectors, tables, chairs) will be required? Who will facilitate the event? Will the facilitator be internal or external to the organization? Will staff be paid for time spent at the learning event? Is it necessary to schedule extra staff to cover for staff attending the event? Please see Table 2 in \"Developing an Education Plan\" for additional information about resources.Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006E-54 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines E-54 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Ongoing education plan The initial learning event is only the rst step to incorporating the guidelines into routine practice. Following the learning event, there must be a plan in place for ensuring that staff have the opportunity to refresh and update their knowledge at regular intervals and have access to a knowledgeable colleague if there are questions. In addition, the education plan should include a procedure for providing new staff with orientation and education about the guidelines. Source: Registered Nurses Association of Ontario.

Pilot site pearl: In several pilot sites, the team coordinator was the only one developing and delivering staff in-services. In most cases, these individuals did not have protected time to devote to staff training; rather, they were expected to add this duty to their already heavy workloads. As a result, the team coordinators felt overwhelmed, and staff training was delayed. To avoid these pitfalls, team coordinators offered the following advice to would-be-trainers: establish a training-team, and ensure members of that team have protected time for developing, advertising, delivering, and evaluating in-services.

It will also help determine whether staff have applied new knowledge to everyday practice. Evaluation should begin with an assessment of current knowledge, attitudes and practices, and should continue throughout the program to identify gaps and directions for future initiatives. Evaluation efforts should focus on three areas: 1) Participant satisfaction with the program; 2) Changes in knowledge, skills and attitudes; and 3) Application into practice, measured by changes in practice in the actual practice setting. Table 4 contains some helpful ideas about how to evaluate each of these areas.

Ankle Brachial Pressure Systolic ankle pressure over brachial pressure as measured by use of a Doppler. Index (ABPI) Normal pressure index is 0.8-1.2. Ankle Flare The characteristic clinical sign evident in the region of the ankle associated with venous hypertension/varicose veins visible as a result of a number of engorged veins in the area. Antibiotic An agent that is synthesized from a living organism (e.g., mold from penicillin) and can kill or halt the growth of microbes or bacteria. Atherosclerotic A thickening, hardening, and loss of elasticity of the blood vessel walls. Antimicrobial An agent that inhibits the growth of microbes.1 Antiseptic (Topical): Product with antimicrobial activity designed for use on skin or other super cial tissues; may damage cells.1 Atrophie Blanche White, avascular areas of scar tissue that are susceptible to skin breakdown. These areas can be quite painful. Bacteremia The presence of viable bacteria in the circulating blood.1 Bottoming Out Expression used to describe inadequate support from a mattress overlay or seat cushion as determined by a \"hand check\". To perform a hand check, the caregiver places an outstretched hand (palm up) under the overlay or cushion below the pressure ulcer or that part of the body at risk for a pressure ulcer. If the caregiver feels less than an inch of support material, the patient has bottomed out and the support surface is therefore inadequate.1 Cell Migration Movement of cells in the repair process. Cellulitis Infl ammation of cellular or connective tissue. Infl ammation may be diminished or absent in immunosuppressed individuals.1 Champagne Leg Wide calf and narrow, woody ankle. Charcot Joint A neuropathic deformity that occurs in the presence of diabetic neuropathy. Often as a result of trauma; may cause collapse of the arch of the foot and a rocker bottom deformity. Clean Containing no foreign material or debris. Colonized The presence of bacteria on the surface or in the tissue of a wound without indications of infection such as purulent exudate, foul odour, or surrounding infl ammation. All Stage II, III, and IV pressure ulcers are colonized.1 Compression Bandaging The deliberate application of pressure using elastic bandages.Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006F-2 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines F-2 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Contaminated Containing bacteria, other microorganisms, or foreign material. The term usually refers to bacterial contamination and in this context is synonymous with colonized. Wounds with bacterial counts of 10x5 organisms per gram of tissue or less are generally considered contaminated; those with higher counts are generally considered infected.1 Culture (Bacterial) Removal of bacteria from wound for the purpose of placing them in a growth medium in the laboratory to propagate to the point where they can be identi ed and tested for sensitivity to various antibiotics. Swab cultures are generally inadequate for this purpose.1 Culture (Swab) Techniques involving the use of a swab to remove bacteria from a wound and place them in a growth medium for propagation and identi cation. Swab cultures obtained from the surface of a pressure ulcer are usually positive because of surface colonization and should not be used to diagnose ulcer infection.1 Debridement Removal of devitalized tissue and foreign matter from a wound. Various methods can be used for this purpose. Autolytic Debridement The use of synthetic dressings to cover a Autolytic Debridement The use of synthetic dr essings to cover a Autolytic Debridement wound and allow eschar to self-disgest by the action of enzymes present in wound fl uids.1 Enzymatic (Chemical) Debridement The topical application of proteolytic (Chemical) Debridement The topical application of pr oteolytic Enzymatic (Chemical) Debridement substances (enzymes) to breakdown devitalized tissue.1 Mechanical Debridement Removal of foreign material and Mechanical Debridement Removal of for eign material and Mechanical Debridement devitalized or contaminated tissue from a wound by physical forces rather than by chemical (enzymatic) or natural (autolytic) forces. Examples are wet-to-dry dressings, wound irrigations, whirlpool, and dextranomers.1 Sharp Debridement Removal of foreign material or devitalized Sharp Debridement Removal of for eign material or devitalized Sharp Debridement tissue by a sharp instrument such as a scalpel. Laser debridement is also considered a type of sharp debridement.1 Dependent A dependent position is the fallen, limp or relaxed position of a limb or extremity. Deterioration Negative course. Failure of the pressure ulcer to heal, as shown by wound enlargement that is not brought about by debridement.1 Doppler Ultrasound The use of very high frequency sound in the detection and measurement of (in leg ulcer assessment) blood fl ow. Edema The presence of excessive amounts of fl uid in the intercellular tissue spaces of the body.Skin and Wound Care Guidelines F-3 Glossary Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines F-3 Electrical Stimulation The use of an electrical current to transfer energy to a wound. The type of electricity that is transferred is controlled by the electrical source. Erythema Redness of the skin. Blanchable Erythema Reddened area that temporarily turns white or pale when pressure is applied with a ngertip. Blanchable erythema over a pressure site is usually due to a normal reactive hyperaemic response. Nonblanchable Erythema Redness that persists when ngertip pressure is applied. Nonblanchable erythema over a pressure site is a symptom of a Stage I pressure ulcer. Eschar Thick, hard, black, leathery, necrotic, devitalized tissue. Exudate Fluid, cells or other substances that have slowly been exuded or discharged fr om other cells and blood vessels through small pores or breaks in the cell membranes. Fascia A sheet or band of brous tissue that lies deep below the skin or encloses muscles and various organs of the body.1 Fibrin An insoluble protein that is essential to clotting of blood, formed from brinogen by action of thrombin. Friction Mechanical force exerted when skin is dragged across a coarse surface such as bed linens.1 Full Thickness Skin Loss The absence of epidermis and dermis.1 Gaiter Area 2.5 cm below the malleolus to the lower one third of the calf. Granulation Tissue The pink/red, moist tissue that contains new blood vessels, collagen, broblasts, and infl ammatory cells, which lls an open, previously deep wound when it starts to heal.1 Growth Factors Proteins that affect the proliferation, movement, maturation, and biosynthetic activity of cells. For the purposes of this guideline, these are proteins that can be produced by living cells.1 Healing A dynamic process in which anatomical and functional integrity is restored. This process can be monitored and measured. For wounds of the skin, it involves repair of the dermis (granulation tissue formation) and epidermis (epithelialization). Healed wounds represent a spectrum of repair: they can be ideally healed (tissue regeneration), minimally healed (temporary return of anatomical continuity), or acceptably healed (sustained functional and anatomical result). The acceptably healed wound is the ultimate outcome of wound healing but not necessarily the appr opriate outcome for all patients.1 Primary Intention Healing Closure and healing of wound edges using sutures, staples, steristrips or skin grafts.Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006F-4 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines F-4 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Secondary Intention Healing Closure and healing of a wound by the formation of granulation tissue and epithelization. Hemosiderin Brown staining or discoloration of the tissues due to deposits of iron byproduct. Hyperbaric Oxygen Oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure that can be applied either to the whole client inside a pressurized chamber or to a localized area (such as an arm or leg) inside a smaller chamber. Induration Engorgement of tissues, evidenced as a hard, elevated area of infl ammation. Infection The presence of bacteria or other microorganisms in suf cient quantity to damage tissue or impair healing. Clinical experience has indicated that wounds can be classi ed as infected when the wound tissue contains 105 or greater microorganisms per gram of tissue. Clinical signs of infection may not be present, especially in the immuno-compromised client or the client with a chronic wound. Infl ammatory Response A localized protective response elicited by injury or destruction of tissues that serves to destroy, dilute, or wall off both the injurious agent and the injured tissue. Clinical signs include pain, heat, redness, swelling, and loss of function. Infl ammation may be diminished or absent in immunosuppressed clients. Intermittent Claudication Cramplike pains in the legs caused by reduced arterial circulation, often exacerbated with exercise. Irrigation Cleansing by a stream of fl uid, preferably saline.1 Ischemia De ciency of blood supply to a tissue, often leading to tissue necrosis.1 La Place's Law The theoretical pressure produced beneath a bandage can be calculated as follows: P = 4630 x N x T C x W Where P = sub-bandage pressure (mmHg) N = number of layers T = tension within bandage (Kgforce) C = limb circumference (cm) W = width of bandage (cm) A bandage applied with constant tension to a limb of normal proportions will automatically produce graduated compression with the highest pressure at the ankle. This pressure will gradually reduce up the leg as the circumference increases. Lipodermatosclerosis (LDS) Firm, brotic skin and subcutaneous tissue. Gives the lower leg a \"champagne glass\" look. Low Air Loss A series of interconnected woven fabric air pillows that allow some air to escape through the support surface. The pillows can be variable infl ated to adjust the level of pressure relief.1Skin and Wound Care Guidelines F-5 Glossary Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines F-5 Maceration Softening of tissue by soaking in fl uids. In this context, it refers to degenerative change and disintegration of skin when it has been kept too moist.1 Malleolus Ankle bone. Malnutrition State of nutritional insuf ciency due to either inadequate dietary intake or defective assimilation or utilization of food ingested.1 Moisture In the context of this document, moisture refers to skin moisture that may increase the risk of pressure ulcer development and impair healing of existing ulcers. Primary sources of skin moisture include perspiration, urine, feces, drainage from wounds, or stulas.1 Multidisciplinary A process where health care professionals representing expertise from various health care disciplines participate in a prevention based program standardizing and practicing pressure ulcer management. Necrosis/Necrotic Tissue Describes devitalized (dead) tissue, e.g., eschar and slough. Needle Aspiration Removal of fl uid from a cavity by suction, often to obtain a sample (aspirate) for culturing. Osteomyelitis A bone infection which can be both localized and generalized. Partial Thickness Loss of epidermis and possible partial loss of dermis. Proliferation To produce new growth or offspring rapidly; to multiply. Purulent Discharge/Drainage A product of infl ammation that contains pus - e.g., cells (leukocytes, bacteria) and lique ed necrotic debris.1 Recalcitrant A recalcitrant wound is a chronic wound which has failed to respond to optimal standard wound care.2 Sepsis The presence of various pus-forming and other pathogenic organisms or their toxins, in the blood or tissues. Clinical signs of blood-borne sepsis include fever, tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and a deterioration in mental status. The same organism is often isolated in both the blood and the pressure ulcer.1 Shear Mechanical force that acts on a unit area of skin in a direction parallel to the body's surface. Shear is affected by the amount of pressure exerted, the coef cient of friction between the materials contacting each other, and the extent to which the body makes contact with the support surface.1 Sinus Tract A cavity or channel underlying a wound that involves an area larger than the visible surface of the wound.1 It is a pathway that can extend in any direction from the wound surface, which results in dead space with potential for abscess formation. Skin Equivalent A material used to cover open tissue that acts as a substitute for nascent (beginning) dermis and epidermis and that has at least some of the characteristics of human skin (e.g., amniotic tissue, xenografts, human allografts). For the purpose of this guideline, only tissue with viable, biologically active cells is given this designation.1Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006F-6 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines F-6 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines Slough Necrotic (dead) tissue in the process of separating from viable portions of the body.1 It is seen as the accumulation of dead cellular debris on the wound surface, and tends to be yellow in colour due to the large amounts of leukocytes pr esent. However, yellow tissue is not always indicative of slough but may be subcutaneous tissue, tendon or bone instead. Static Air Mattress A vinyl mattress overlay composed of interconnected air cells that are infl ated with a blower before use. The shifting of air among the cells distributes pressure uniformly over the support area to create a fl otation effect. Static Device Pressure-reducing devices designed to provide support characteristics that remain (or Static Support Surfaces) constant - i.e., do not cycle in time. Examples include foam overlays, cushions, and water mattresses.1 Telangiectasia Permanent dilation of super cial capillaries and venules. This is often referred to as areas of \"starburst\" vessels. Tissue Biopsy Use of a sharp instrument to obtain a sample of skin, muscle, or bone.1 Topical Antibiotic A drug known to inhibit or kill microorganisms that can be applied locally to a tissue surface.1 Topical Antiseptic Product with antimicrobial activity designed for use on skin or other super cial tissues; may damage some cells.1 Trochanter Bony prominence on the upper part of the femur. Tunneling A passageway under the surface of the skin that is generally open at the skin level; however, most of the tunneling is not visible.1 Underlying Tissue Tissue that lies beneath the surface of the skin such as fatty tissue, supporting structures, muscle, and bone.1 Undermining A closed passageway under the surface of the skin that is open only at the skin surface. Generally it appears as an area of skin ulceration at the margins of the ulcer with skin overlaying the area. Undermining often develops from shearing forces.1 Vacuum Assisted Wound A closed wound management system which facilitates a negative pressure across Closure the complete wound interface through suction, thereby stimulating improved circulation and a reduction in exudates production. Varicose Veins A distended, engorged vein, usually as a result of incompetent valves or local trauma. The long saphenous vein is most commonly affected. Venous Eczema Eczema associated with the development of venous ulcers. Also known as venous or stasis dermatitis. Venous Hypertension Back pressure on the venous system exerted either from central or pulmonary sources, or from extrinsic compression syndrome. For example, a mass, tumour, or tight girdle. Venous Insuf ciency An which permits retrograde fl ow, or muscle pump failure, resulting in incomplete emptying of the venous system in the lower leg. Skin and Wound Care Guidelines F-7 Glossary Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006Skin and Wound Care Guidelines F-7 Venous Leg Ulcers Wounds that usually occur on the lower leg in people with venous insuf ciency disease. Venous leg ulcers are also known terms as venous stasis ulcer and venous insuf ciency. Ulcers result from chronic venous hypertension caused by the failure of the calf muscle pump.3Saskatchewan Skin and Wound Care Guidelines, March 2006F-8 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines F-8 Skin and Wound Care Guidelines REFERENCES 1.

The skin's functions are: maintenance of body temperature, protection and immunity, sensory perception, absorpti on, synthesis of Vitamin D, excretion of waste products, main tenance of body pH and provision of a waterproof layer (Collier, 1996). The dressing replaces the skin for the time the wound is in situ and so must attempt to manage many of these functions. There are four guidelines for selecting a wound dressing: 1. Function- Learn about dressings by function. 2. Consider safety, effectiveness, us er-friendliness and cost effectiveness. 3. Change dressings based on an assessment of the pat ient, the wound and the dressing, not on standardized routines. 4. Adapt the wound treatment to optimize heali ng throughout the phases of the healing process. Factors Influencing Dressing Selection Wound type Description Character Bacterial profile Blood supply Dressing choices Post-surgical Wounds Moist Sterile A dequate Gauze, foam, hydrofiber (depends on amount of exudate) Epithelializing wounds Epithelial tissue Epithelial tissue (silver) -Moist Contaminated or colonized Adequate Heavily exudating - hydrofiber or alginate combined with foam, combination product Moderately exudating - foams \u00b1 hydrofiber (depends on length of wear time) or hydrocolloids + hydrofiber Lightly exudating - thin foams, hydrocolloids 3, 4 Granulating Granulating (red base) -Moist -May bleed easily Contaminated or colonized Adequate Heavily exudating - hydrofibers or alginates combined combination products. Moderately exudating - foams \u00b1 hydrofiber (depends on length of wear time) or hydrocolloid + hydrofiber. Lightly exudating - thin foams, hydrocolloids Cavity wounds - ribbon gauze, hydrofiber or alginate. Stage X Necrotic Dry/ black or gray Colonized or Infected Not adequate Dry out the wound with Betadine, cicatrin, or gauze Stage X Necrotic Dry/black or gray Colonized or Infected Adequate Hydrating products or Hydrogels Stage X Sloughy Moist/yellow or Infected Adequate Debriding products (Cadexomer Idodine, hydrocolloids (depending on moisture level).
