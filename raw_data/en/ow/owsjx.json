More than 10 years later, the field of QTL analysis is heading towards a crisis. The National Center forBiotechnology Information (NCBI) lists 700 QTLs that are found in rats (see the Entrez Gene web site in the Online links box), and the mouse genome database cur-rently contains 2,050 mouse QTLs (see the Mouse Genome Informatics web site in the Online links box). Compare these figures with the number of candidate genes that are proposed to underlie QTLs in rodents (TABLES 1,2) .Ifwe uncritically accept all the claims as cor- rect, only about 20 genes have been identified. Even if no more QTLs are mapped, at the present rate of progress(20 genes identified in 15 years) it will take 1,500 years tofind all the genes that underlie known QTLs. Several recent developments have been published that might make what is currently almost impossiblemore tractable. These include new genomic resources(for example, the availability of sequences andsequence variants), animal resources (for example,chromosome substitution strains and the proposedCollaborative Cross), techniques (such as in silico mapping and whole-genome expression studies) andanalytical tools (such as quantitative complementa-tion tests and Yin-Y ang crosses, see below for moreinformation). In this review, we discuss the realized or potential success of new approaches to identify genes that under-lie QTLs.We fo cus on methods to identify genetic vari- ants that have only a small effect on the phenotype (bywhich we mean that the variants account for 10% orless of the phenotypic variation of a quantitativetrait). In the past, robust and reliable detection of small-effect QTLs has been a problem 5;but, as should be evident from the number of QTLs that have beenreported, difficulties in QTL detection are not imped- ing research. The methods might not be the most effi-cient, but there is no doubt that QTLs can be detectedat high levels of significance and that the findings canbe replicated, even for behavioural phenotypes 6-9. Although it is likely that only a small fraction of thetotal number of QTLs that segregate in inbred strain crosses are currently known to us (not to mentionthose in outbred stocks), without the ability to deter-mine the genes they represent, their detection is oflimited interest. We urgently need advances in gene,not QTL, identification.STRATEGIES FOR MAPPING AND CLONING QUANTITATIVE TRAITGENES IN Jonathan Flint, William Valdar, Sagiv Shifman and Richard Mott Abstract | Over the past 15 years, more than 2,000 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified in crosses between inbred strains of mice and rats, but less than 1% have beencharacterized at a molecular level. However, new resources, such as chromosomesubstitution strains and the proposed Collaborative Cross, together with new analyticaltools, including probabilistic ancestral haplotype reconstruction in outbred mice, Yin-Yangcrosses and in silico analysis of sequence variants in many inbred strains, could make QTL cloning tractable. We review the potential of these strategies to identify genes that underlieQTLs in rodents. Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford Univer sity, Roosevelt Drive, Group 272|APRIL |VOLUME 6 www.nature.com/reviews/geneticsREVIEWS probable effectiveness of the new approaches? T o answer this question, we need to define success, which is not sostraightforward. Two recent reviews that attempt this taskidentify 21 genes in total, but agree about the identifica-tion of only four genes in mice and five in rats 11,12.A s many have pointed out, there is no single proof that con-firms a gene at a QTL and, to a large extent, each case hasto be evaluated on its own strengths 13,14.Replacing one allele with another at a locus through targeted mutagene-sis with subsequent functional analysis provides a strin-gent test, as does complementation, but these proceduresmight not be possible (or even necessary) in every case:alternative evidence can provide sufficient proof that thegene has been found. There are also issues about what to include as a QTL. Strictly speaking, a QTL is any locus that con- tributes to a phenotype that is measured quantitatively. However,some investigators use a quantitative mea- sure for a phenotype that others assess qualitatively(for example, susceptibility to cancer can be assessed asaffected or not affected, or by a quantitative measure,such as the number of tumours). T o be comprehen-sive, we have summarized data on candidate genes inBefore proceeding, we should also be clear about what we exclude from our discussion. In this paper,we do not consider artificially induced mutations that present as QTLs, such as those that are due to mutage-nesis, although it has been suggested that mutagenesisin the mouse can be used to determine the geneticbasis of quantitative traits instead of QTL mapping 10. Screening mice for the quantitative effects of inducedmutations is doubtless an efficient method for the identification of genes that are involved in the expres-sion of a phenotype, quantitative or otherwise.However,our concern here is with the subset of poly- morphic loci that give rise to phenotypic variation innatural populations (although we admit that labora-tory mouse populations are in many respects unnat- ural). Mutagenesis does not distinguish betweenthese loci number of loci that are func-tionally invariant in nature, but in which mutationscan be induced.

Effect size. First, the QTLs that have yielded genes have had exceptionally large EFFECT SIZES .To appreciate how large, we ideally need an unbiased estimate of the typicalQTL effect size. Unfortunately this is difficult to obtain because, in cases of low statistical power to detecteffect sizes, the contributions of detected QTLs areTABLES 1,2 .TABLE 1 lists candidate genes at loci where the effects are expressed as the percentage of the totalphenotypic variance. TABLE 2 lists candidate genes at susceptibility loci, the effec ts of which are expressed as differences in penetrance. The weight of evidence in favour of each gene varies considerably. For example, Ferraro and col-leagues have proposed Kcnj10 as a candidate gene that is involved at a seizure-susceptibility locus on the basisof finding sequence variants in coding regions andgene expression in the relevant tissue, but had to con-sider data for 120 genes within the region of study 15.

Data are from 14 recent quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping experiments (including 244 significant QTLs). Behavioural QTL data are from REF. 116 QTLs are from REFS Group 274|APRIL 2005 |VOLUME 6 www.nature.com/reviews/geneticsREVIEWS FIGURE 1 shows that the distribution of effect sizes for both behavioural and physiological phenotypes arealmost identical, as are the average effects of the unclonedQTLs for these phenotypes, which ar e 5.8% and 5.3%, respectively. The average effect size of a cloned QTL is 26% (TABLE 1) .Ifwe restrict our attention to the QTL genes that have been most stringently confirmed (bycomplementation), then the average effect size is 50%. Clearly, it is easier to identify genes when the QTL effectsizes are large. In fact, the true effect sizes of most uncloned QTLs are almost certainly much smaller than the 5-6% aver-age mentioned above, and this is not just because ofover-estimated 17,18.With this caveat in mind, FIG. 1 shows a comparison of effect sizes from a reasonably complete survey of behavioural QTLs (94 significant QTLs) and a compendium of physiological pheno- types (such as growth, weight, blood pressure and gall stones; note that we are using data from unclonedQTLs). It is important to realize that effect sizes depend on the mapping population in which they aremeasured (see BOX 1 for a detailed discussion; see also FIG. 2 ). Here, and in the rest of this review, we use effect size to mean the percentage of the total phenotypicvariance that is explained by the QTL segregating in anF2 intercross.Box 1 | How QTL effect size depends on the mapping population The effect size of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) depends on the population in which the QTL alleles segregate. Here, we give a quantitative treatment and show that a genetic effect that produces a QTL with a 5% effect in a recombinant inbred (RI) population will produce a QTL that explains ~2.6% of the phenotypic variance in an F2 generation and ~1.3% in abackcross (BC). Consider a diallelic QTL at which a major allele has frequency pand physiological effect g,and a minor allele has frequency q= (1 - p). Let Gbe the genetic effect of the QTL on the phenotype for a given animal. The genetic variance, Va r(G), in each population is 4 g 2pqfor RI, 2 g2pqfor F2, and g2pqfor BC (REF. 5) .This shows that the genetic variance coming from the QTL \u2014 that is, the proportion of the phenotypic variance it explains \u2014 decreases in the ratio 4:2:1 for RI:F2:BC (FIG. 2) .What does this do to the effect size of the QTL in these populations? In the simplest case where there are no other genetic components, the environmental variance Va r(E) is constant and the effect size, ,is shown in equation 1. (1) The top part of the table shows for each population and how the effect of a QTL in an RI becomes smaller in F2 and BC populations132.(Note that '|' in the table means 'conditional on' .) But what if there are kQTLs that affect the trait? We take the simple case of k\u2014 unlinked, diallelic, independent, additive QTLs. The genetic variance coming from the ith QTL in, for example, an RI, will be 4 gi2piqi,and the total genetic variance Va r(G) in the RI will be (2) The bottom part of the table gives the effect size, 1,ofQTL 1, (which accounts for a fraction of the genetic variance) in RI, F2 and BC populations, as well as conditional effect sizes. In the table, we make the substitution defined in equation 3for brevity. (3) The drop in effect size moving from RI-F2-BC is shallower when other genetic components have a large role in the phenotype. In the extreme case of no environmental variance (when other QTLs account for all the remainingphenotypic variance), there is no drop at all. At the other extreme, when = 1, the formulae are the same as in the top part of the table.Measure RI F2 BC Single QTL system 4g2pq 2g2pq g2pq4g2pq + Var (E) 2g2pq + Var (E) g2pq + Var (E) RIRI|RIRI2 + Var(E) 1,RIRI1|1, RI (Va r(G)+V ar iikk gi2piqi ik = \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group NATURE REVIEWS |GENETICS VOLUME 6 |APRIL 2005 |275REVIEWS only does the sequence tell us which gene is the most likely candidate, it also indicates what experiments areneeded to confirm the candidacy. For example, comple-mentation will rescue the function of a null allele, or abiochemical or pharmacological intervention will deter-mine whether an aberrant protein is involved. Unfortun-ately, possessing a recognizable molecular signaturemight be the exception rather than the rule for QTLs(although, admittedly, we have only a small sample ofcloned QTLs to assess). Although SNPs that cause monogenic disease have a strong tendency to occur at highly conserved aminoacids, this does not seem to be true of variants in com-plex diseases. At least in human studies, the pattern ofdisease-associated coding variants is so far indistin-guishable from the distribution that is found in thenormal population 36.Moreover, in many cases, no cod- ing-sequence variant is found; instead many sequencevariants are detected in non-coding DNA in regions, thefunction of which (if any) is unclear 31,37.In these cases, we do not yet have an easy method to prove the involvementof a gene at a QTL. It is important to emphasize that identifying a gene is not the same as isolating a sequence variant (or quanti-tative trait nucleotide; QTN). Discovering a QTN doesnot guarantee gene identification because the positionof sequence variants does not necessarily coincide withthe position of the genes on which the QTNs have aneffect. For example, a QTN could lie within a regulatoryregion that is megabases away from its cognate gene 38. Note also that it is a QTN, not a gene, that segregates in a cross, so genetic strategies for QTL dissection focus onsequence variants, not genes. The measure of success. Before we look at new methods, we should be clear about how well the old methods per- form (BOX 2) .The relevant points (taken from a theoreti- cal literature that is almost as extensive as the reports onQTL mapping) are as follows: 300 F2 animals can be used to map a QTL with an effect size of 5% onto a 40-cMstatistical problems in their estimation. Perhaps the most important finding to emerge from attempts toclone genes that underlie rodent QTLs is that a singlegenetic effect, as detected in an inbred strain cross, turnsout in most cases to be due to several physically linkedsmall effects. There are many examples of this phenom-enon, including QTLs that influence seizures 19,obesity20, growth21,b l o o d pressure22-26,diabetes27,antibody pro- duction28and infection29.Classical approaches to gene identification (BOX 2) generally assume that a single QTL is just that, a single genetic effect. By not allowing for thefractionation of the QTL, gene identification becomesmuch more frustrating. Unfortunately, we still do not have a precise picture of the genetic architecture of QTLs in rodents, or indeedin any organism 30.Just how small are the effects likely to be? At the rarely achieved level of mapping wheregenetic effects can be resolved into intervals of a hun-dred kilobases or less, QTLs might further disintegrate.This has been found in studies of a behavioural QTLs inmice 31,and has been seen in similar work in other species32,33.Further high-resolution information at other QTLs might drive the estimate of average effectsize below 5%. In short, QTLs are predominantly loci with small effects, so the problem of identifying the genes thatunderlie them is a problem of identifying the molecularbasis of small genetic effects. Whether we call the locus a QTL or not is of little importance; at the moment, the distinction that makes cloning tractable is between largeand small effect sizes. Unless we have methods that canidentify the genes at QTLs that contribute 1 or 2% to thephenotypic variation, the backlog of uncloned QTLswill remain. Molecular signature. The second lesson from the success stories in TABLE 2 is that finding a recognizable molecular signature at a QTL, such as a sequence variant thatintroduces a stop codon or that changes protein func-tion, makes QTL cloning tractable 34,35.In such cases, notCONGENIC A strain produced by a breeding strategy that delineates agenomic region containing atrait locus.

Intercrossing the F1 generates an F2 and backcrossing to one or other of the parental strains produces a backcross. The number of animals ( n) needed to map an additive QTL in an F2 can be calculated using equation 1 (REFS 5,42) . (1) Z1 - /2is the cut-off point in a standard normal distribution for a probability of 1 - /2 and is the significance threshold. If we use a genome-wide significance threshold of log P4.3 (REF. 133) from normal tables, the cut-off point is 3.89. If we set the power at 90% (in other words, 10% chance of missing a true association) then we need a Z1 - of 1.28 (from normal tables). VQTLis the proportion of variance that is attributable to the QTL. For a purely additive QTL that explains 5% of the variance, the calculation yields equation 2. (2) Recombinant inbred (RI) lines A pair of inbred strains is intercrossed and their progeny is inbred to generate a panel of inbred animals, each with a different combination of the progenitor genomes. Once a set of RI lines has been genotyped, the marker data are available for all subsequent mapping experiments, which take place by determining the strains that are present at a marker and by correlatingthis strain distribution pattern with phenotypic differences. Using the terminology given above for power in an F2 intercross,the relationship between the number of animals ( n) and the effect size of the QTL is given by equation 3 (REF. 134) . (3) Congenics and interval-specific congenics Congenics are still the mainstay of fine-mapping QTLs in rodents. By repeatedly backcrossing one strain onto another, it is possible to create animals that have a particular genomic region from one strain and the remainder of their genomefrom the other; subsequent intercrossing makes the genomic se gment homozygous and the mouse fully inbred. However, inadequate or incorrect assumptions about the distribu tion of chromosome segments, the population structure, the marker spacing and the selection strategy might mean that the breeding does not go as predicted 59.Flaherty and colleagues point out that transgenic mice, which are routinely created on a 129 background and then backcrossed onto another strain (usually C57BL/6), can be used as congenics for the interval around the engineered mutation135.A n interval-specific congenic is made by first identifying an animal with a recombinant chromosome in a region of interestand then backcrossing it for several generations to remove other QTLs. Resultant animals are intercrossed, andhomozygotes for the recombinant haplotype are selected. Recombinant congenics and genome-tagged mice Recombinant congenics are a type of RI line made by backcrossing and randomly fixing parts of the genome by inbreeding, so that each contains an average of 87.5% genes of a common background strain and 12.5% of a commondonor 136.Genome-tagged mice are sets of overlapping congenics with sufficient material from one strain crossed onto the other so that the whole genome is represented137.The 60 strains created by West and colleagues contain segments of about 23 cM that are INTROGRESSED from either DBA/2 or CAST/Ei onto C57BL/6 (REF. 137) . Recombinant progeny testing Animals that have a recombinant chromosome in a region of interest are backcrossed to a parental strain to determine the location of the QTL relative to the recombination point. Advanced intercross lines Two parental strains are crossed to produce an F1 that is intercrossed to produce an F2. Subsequent generations are produced by intercrossing, so that animals in an advanced intercross line accumulate new recombinants. Animals aremaintained according to a pseudo-random breeding protocol to reduce loss of genetic variation in the population. An appropriate advanced intercross line could take at least 5 years to make, but it can be used to map many loci. Heterogeneous stocks Genetically, heterogeneous stocks are derived from inbred strains through a series of progressive intercrosses. Existing heterogeneous stocks are derived from eight strains, but any number can be used (an advanced intercross line isa heterogeneous stock derived from two strains). By subsequently maintaining the stock for many generations, using a pseudo-random breeding protocol, recombinants are introdu ced that allow high-resolution mapping. Traits are mapped by associating allelic variants with a phenotype, so that genotyping must be carried out for each experiment. Two heterogeneous stocks have been used for mouse mapping experiments: the older of the two (the Boulder heterogeneous stock), has been breeding for more than 60 generations and is derived from the C57BL/6, BALB/c, RIII, AKR, DBA/2, I,A/J and C3H strains 138.The second heterogeneous stock (the Northport heterogeneous stock) has passed its fortieth generation139,and is DBA/2J and LP/J strains. Genetic variation from many strains complicates analysis, but robust and powerful QTL detection is possible by estimating theprobability that an allele descends from each progenitor strain 70(BOX 3) . + Z1 - ) (1 - VQTL)VQTLZ1 - /2 ((1 - VQTL)1/22 n = + 1.28)2 = 527 (0.96)0.05(3.89 0.97 n - 2 = (1 - V QTL)(Z1 - /2 + Z 1 - )2 (VQTL) \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group NATURE REVIEWS |GENETICS VOLUME 6 |APRIL 2005 |277REVIEWS QTLs in the first mouse CSS experiment51.Notably, this is not a substantial saving on the numbers used for anF2 intercross (BOX 2) . A comparison between parental and CSS strains will only map a QTL to a chromosome. For higher- resolution mapping, CSS strains allow the rapid creation of a congenic strain, either by using interval-specific con-genic strains or by recombinant progeny testing 42(BOX 2) . Because of the relative increase in effect size, congenicconstruction and recombinant progeny testing will require 3-4 generations to reduce the interval to 1 cM, rather than the 9-10 generations that are required when starting from an F2 intercross 52. QTL mapping in a CSS delivers researchers to the same point faster than classical strategies have led them,but no farther. The main drawback of the method isthat it makes no allowances for the fractionation of alarge QTL effect into many loci with smaller effects. Thisis the problem that has for so long beset the use of con-genics for QTL dissection and gene identification. CSSmapping is a powerful method for the identification ofsmall-effect QTLs, but it does not offer advantages overother methods for the identification of genes. Collaborative Cross: a proposal Would the difficulties of QTL cloning be overcome if we had 1,000 recombinant inbred (RI) lines, as suggestedby the Complex Trait Consortium 53? Although the Collaborative Cross \u2014 a panel of 1,000 RIs derived from 8 parental strains \u2014 is only a proposal, not anexisting resource, we discuss it here because it might provide a tool for gene identification (although this isnot the sole reason for its creation 53). The use of RI lines for QTL mapping in rodents has so far been limited by the relatively small size of each set.The BXD RI set (which is derived from C57BL/6 and DBA/2 strains) consisting (until recently) of 26 lineshas 90% power to detect a QTL that explains half the phenotypic variance in a trait 54.The comparable effect of a QTL segregating in an F2 generation is half this value(because the F2 animals are not inbred), or 25% of thephenotypic variance (BOX 1) .What happens to power and mapping resolution if we have 100 lines? We have investigated this question using a simula- tion55.Fine mapping of a QTL with a 5% effect is effi- cient: 100 provide 80% power for QTL detectionat a 5% significance level. Mapping resolution is alsogood: the 95% confidence interval is 7 cM. Fortunately,RI panels approaching this size are now available: theLXS panel consists of 77 lines 56and the expanded BXD set consists of 90 lines57.Therefore, the new RI sets can deliver high resolution, although this is still insufficientlyhigh to identify genes at small-effect QTLs. The proposed Collaborative Cross differs in two ways from standard RI lines. It is created from eightprogenitors, not two as is the case with RI lines, so thatthe set would contain more genetic diversity than a stan-dard RI. Second, the proposal is to create 1,000 lines,ten times more than the largest available set. Whatwould be the advantage, for gene identification, in hav- ing such an RI set? Mapping resolution improves tointerval with 50% power, using markers that are spaced every 20 cM across the genome 39.Increasing the marker density does not appreciably increase mapping resolu-tion for small-effect QTLs 40.Increasing the number of animals increases the likelihood of QTL detection (sothat with 800 animals there is a greater than 99% chanceof detecting a QTL with an effect size of 5%; BOX 2 ), but does not increase resolution sufficiently to identifygenes \u2014 even 1,000 animals will only map a 5% QTLonto an interval of about 10 cM (REF. 41) .In summary, a standard inbred-strain mapping experiment will needabout 400 animals and will use 100 markers. Starting from a cross between two inbred animals, it could take less than 6 months to map a QTL to a 40-cM region. It will take a few more years to isolate a QTL by creating CONGENICS42(BOX 2) .Alternatively, by continuing to intercross beyond the F2 generation, fine mapping can be carried out in an advanced intercross line or aheterogeneous stock 43(BOX 2) .After 6 years, we can rea- sonably expect traditional strategies to have resolved a5% QTL into a region of about 1 cM, which in themouse corresponds to 2 Mb on average. The averagegene density in the mouse is about 10 genes permegabase, so a 1 cM QTL interval will contain about 20 genes (note that gene density varies significantlyacross the genome). Keeping this in mind, we now turnto the new strategies to see how they fare in comparison. Chromosome substitution strains Chromosome substitution strains (CSSs) consist of a set of animals in which one chromosome is derived fromone strain and all the rest are derived from another. Formice, a panel of 22 CSS strains is required (for 19 auto-somes, 2 sex chromosomes and mitochondria), or 44 if areciprocal set (with both parents as progenitor donors) is used. QTL mapping is carried out through the relativelysimple process of comparing the phenotypes of eachstrain with the parental background strain. CSS strainswere first used to map QTLs in mice in 1999 (REF. 44) ; theoretical aspects ofthe mapping process were subse- quently described for mice45and rats46,47.The method has a long history in plant48and Drosophila genetics49. The first complete CSS set, created from A/J andC57BL/6 strains, was produced in 2004 and was used todetect QTLs across the mouse genome 50,51. The ease of QTL detection using CSS strains results from two features: first, the background genetic varianceis reduced so that each QTL explains a greater propor-tion of the total phenotypic variation (BOX 1) .S e c o nd, a lower significance level is needed for QTL detectionbecause, compared with the ~100 markers tested in anF2 generation, only 21 comparisons need to be made.Singer and colleagues point out that the F2 intercross requires at least 35% more animals for QTL detection 51. Nevertheless, Belknap estimates that to detect a QTL with an effect size of 6% and with 50% power will require 20 CSS strains and 20 parental animals for each comparison, or between 3 and 400 animals (depending on how many background animals are used) for agenome scan 52.Belknap's estimate of 3 to 400 animals agrees with the actual figure of 435 animals used to map \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group 278|APRIL 2005 |VOLUME 6 www.nature.com/reviews/geneticsREVIEWS understand the principle, we first explain RISTs, which are a particular example of YYCs42. Assume that a QTL has been mapped in an inbred- strain cross. RI strains that have recombinants withinthe QTL interval are crossed with both parentalinbred strains to produce two segregating popula-tions. In one cross, the RI and the parental line sharethe QTL allele, so no QTL segregates; in the othercross, the RI and the parental line have a differentallele at the QTL, and the QTL segregates (hence thename segregation t est). Consequently, the QTL will be mapped to a position either above or below the recom-bination point in the RI that is used for the two crosses.The overall results from a selected set of RIs will locatethe QTL to a small interval. Resolution is determined solely by the number of recombinations in the interval. For example, with 100 RI lines, each having approximately 3.3 recombinations per100 cM (REF. 56) ,the total number of recombinations is 3.3 multiplied by the number in (~1,400) esolution is 1,400/4,620 = 0.30 cM. This corresponds to an interval of 0.6 Mb. With 1,000 RI, the expected accuracy is 0.03cM (potentially a few hundred kilobases). However, recombinations are not distributedevenly in the genome, making the above calculation an approximation only 59. RIST, as with congenic construction and other strategies that seek to treat QTLs as Mendelian geneticfactors, will have problems with multiple linked QTLs;about 4 cM when the number of lines increases to 1,000 and further lines make it possible to map effects that aresmaller than 5%. As we have seen, QTLs have a habit ofdisintegrating when they are dissected and we need theability to find the pieces. Ifthe Collaborative Cross were to be created, it would enable us to map many of the 2,000 uncloned QTLs into small genetic intervals. This is an attractive proposition but it must be balanced against twoimportant disadvantages. First, maintaining and dis-tributing an RI set of 1,000 lines poses significant problems. Even a laboratory devoted to providinganimals to the research community, such as the Jackson Laboratory, is able to maintain only a few hundredstrains as live stock. Second, the resolution of theCollaborative Cross is not sufficient to identify genes: a 4-cM interval is roughly equivalent to 8 Mb ofDNA,which will contain approximately 80 genes. Unfortunately, the Collaborative Cross would give us no help with the final goal of gene discovery. However, onesolution might lie in the application of recombinationinbred segregation tests (RISTs) and its generalization,Yin-Y ang crosses (YYCs). Yin-Yang crosses RISTs and YYCs, applied to a large number of RIs, will increase mapping resolution to the point where indi-vidual genes can be identified. YYCs take advantage of the abundance of recombination events in RI orinbred strains to improve mapping resolution 58.T oHIDDEN MARKOV MODEL A probabilistic description of a system in which the observeddata depends on the hiddeninternal state of the system. Theobjective is usually to infer thelikelihood that the system is in aparticular hidden state, given theobserved data. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING ALGORITHM An algorithm that finds the optimum solution to a probleminvolving Nobjects in terms of the solutions to a series ofsmaller problems that involvesubsets of the objects.Box 3 | Probabilistic ancestral haplotype reconstruction Single-marker association mapping is an inefficient method when the allele frequencies of the variant andthe quantitative trait locus (QTL) do not coincide and when contrasting QTL alleles are in linkagedisequilibrium (LD) with the same marker allele, asillustrated in the figure. In this example, thepopulation from which all chromosomes descended consisted of four inbred strains. Inbred strains A and C contain a QTL allele that increases the phenotype,and strains B and D contain an allele that decreasesthe phenotype. A polymorphic marker, m, that is incomplete LD with the QTL possessing four distinct alleles (labelled 1,2,3,4 in the figure) will showevidence of association. Consider what happens with a diallelic marker, n, that, in the ancestral population, has one al lele '1' that is physically linked to strains A, B and C and the other allele '0' linked to strain D. Evidence of association will now be reduced because the marker fails to partitionthe genotypes into two equally contrasting groups. Things are even worse at markers p and q where both alleles 0 and 1are linked to both increaser and decreaser QTL alleles; there is no detectable association at all. But the haplotypes that are defined by the markers p and q distinguish all four strains and so are surrogates for the efficient marker m. Therefore, multi-point haplotype-based mapping is generall y more powerful than single-point mapping. Heterogeneous stocks are mosaics of eight inbred founder strains, and QTL mapping in these stocks is best approached by reconstructing the ancestral haplotype mosaic. However, the strain distribution patterns ofneighbouring markers rarely distinguish between all founder strains, so instead we compute the probability that ananimal is descended from a given pair of strains at a particular locus. A useful statistical model of the genome mosaic of adiploid heterogeneous stock animal is a pair of HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS ,in which the hidden states of the model are the ancestral strains, and the observed data are the marker genotypes. A DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING ALGORITHM is then used to compute the probabilities of descent using all the available information. The marker alleles must be known in the founder strains for the method to work. Recently, we have shown that other outbred mice of unknown ancestry can be modelled and analysed as mosaics of standard inbred strains in the same way31.1 2 3 4m 1 1 1 0n 1 1 0 0p 0 1 1 0q A B C DQTL \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group NATURE REVIEWS |GENETICS VOLUME 6 |APRIL 2005 |279REVIEWS many thousands are required77.However, QTL analysis in outbred mouse populations is likely to be easier than itshuman equivalent. In fact, it would be as simple and pow- erful as mapping in inbreds if each allele at every locuscould be traced back to a unique progenitor strain, so that ANALYSIS OF V ARIANCE (ANOV A) at a marker extracted maximal information for QTL detection (BOX 3) . In contrast to human populations, in which progeni- tor alleles are unknown (although there are a few excep- tions, such as ADMIXTURE MAPPING78), one type of outbred mouse (heterogeneous stock) is derived from knownancestral inbred strains. This makes it possible, with thehelp of some mathematics, to derive the origin of eachallele and map QTLs at sub-centimorgan resolution (BOX 3) .Unfortunately, mapping a QTL to a megabase interval is still insufficient to identify a single gene.Other outbred stocks might of fer better resolution, but they lack the advantages of progenitor informationfrom the heterogeneous stock. Several methods have been developed that deal with this problem in its various incarnations 79-84.S o far, there has been only one application of this methodin mouse genetics. We have shown that sufficientrecombinants have accumulated in a commercially available outbred stock (known as MF1) to map genetic effects onto regions of only a few hundred kilo-bases or less 31.Sequence analysis showed that variants in the MF1 strain were identical to those found ininbred strains, and haplotype reconstruction revealedthat more than 95% of the haplotypes could bederived from known inbred strains. Therefore, we wereable to map the MF1 strain by probabilistic ancestralhaplotype reconstruction (BOX 3) .It is important to realize that our approach neither required us to recover the correct haplotypes, nor to identify the progenitorstrains correctly. We found that a QTL for anxiety-likebehaviour, previously mapped to an interval of lessthan 1 cM, resolved into three smaller independentQTLs, each about 100-200 kb wide. It would also be possible to combine pedigree and LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM (LD) data for fine mapping in the MF1 strain and,indeed, in other outbred mice 79,81,85. Potentially, outbred animals could deliver a resolu- tion that would be sufficient to guarantee candidature ofa single gene. The disadvantages of the method lie in thecomplexities of the analysis and the need for large num- bers of animals and high-density genotyping. For exam-ple, genome-wide mapping in heterogeneous stocks (BOX 2) requires at least 6,000 SNP markers. T o reduce false-positive results to acceptable levels with thisnumber of markers means imposing stringent signifi- cance thresholds: by permutation, we estimate that the5% and 1% significance levels correspond to P-values, expressed as negative logarithms, of 4.4 and 5.1 (REF. 86), and will require about 1,000 animals to pro- vide 80% power to detect a 5% QTL87.M o r e markers, and more animals, will be needed for whole-genome analysis of more complex outbred stocks. These fea-tures militate against whole-genome analyses usingoutbreds, but developments in high-throughput geno-typing will make it feasible.but unlike the construction of a congenic line, a RIST analysis is quick to carry out, so if multiple QTLs aresuspected, it will be possible to test that hypothesis withfurther RISTs (assuming appropriate recombinant linesare available). Indeed, with 1,000 RI lines, it would bepossible to resolve most QTLs onto an interval thatcontains a few genes in just two generations; an efficient and relatively economical strategy. In some instances,the resolution will be good enough to identify a geneunderlying a QTL. The YYC approach is a generalization of the RIST method that treats inbred strains as if they were RI lines,on the grounds that inbred strains descend from a rela-tively small number of founders. In this respect, YYCsmake the same assumption as in silico mapping, which is discussed below. The large number of recombinationevents that have accumulated in a set of inbred strains since their origin can be used to map the QTL to a smallregion 58.Similar to RISTs, YYCs are used as a fine map- ping tool that is applied after the initial mapping of theQTL. The allelic state of the QTL in multiple strains is revealed by crossing the two strains that were used ini- tially to map the QTL and any new strain. YYCs estab-lish the strain distribution pattern of the QTL, which isused to identify the list of variants in the region thatfollows this distribution. The YYC method is based on the assumption of a single biallelic variant or haplotype that affects the traitin the different strains. Therefore, as for the RISTapproach, the main limitation of YYC analysis withinbred strains is that it is not suitable for multiple QTLsin a region. Furthermore, QTLs that primarily haveepistatic effects will not be suitable for this kind ofanalysis. They will result in inconclusive results of theYin-Y ang analysis, but this is unlikely to produce false negative results. Outbred stocks Outbred stocks accumulate recombinants over time,so that they offer high mapping resolution; potentiallyhigh enough to identify candidate genes. The effects ofindividual genes can be mapped by association, as hasbeen successfully shown in human populations 60-67.I n a few cases, QTLs have been mapped in mouse popula-tions: small-effect QTLs have been mapped to sub-centimorgan resolution using heterogeneous stock mice 68-71(BOX 2) ;crosses using outbred Mus spretus have been used first to map72,73and then to identify serine-threonine kinase 6 candidate skin- tumour susceptibility gene74;outbred CD1 mice have been used a susceptibility locus for pulmonaryadenoma 75;and outbred MF1 strains were used regulator of G-protein signalling 2 ( Rgs2 ) as a gene that influences anxiety in mice31. Mapping in outbreds is not as straightforward as mapping in inbred crosses: it requires higher densitygenotyping and larger numbers of animals. At first sight,the method seems to have not only the advantages, butalso to suffer from the same drawbacks, as humangenetic association studies, where robust, replicableresults have been hard to obtain 76and sample sizes ofANALYSIS OF V ARIANCE A statistical method to test the null hypothesis that the mean values of two or more groups areequal. The variance around themean in groups is comparedwith the variance of the group mean. In genetic applications,the variance between families iscompared with the variance within families. A significant F-ratio implies that variance between families is larger thanwithin families. ADMIXTURE MAPPING Genetic mapping using individuals whose genomes are mosaics of fragments that are descended fromgenetically di stinct populations. This method exploits differencesin allele frequencies in thefounders to determine ancestryat a locus in order to map traits,in a way that is broadly similar toan advanced intercross. LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM The tendency for markers genotypes whenthey are physically close together.Over several generations,recombination will break down linkage between markers and aQTL, so that linkage disequilibrium will only occurbetween markers that are closeto a QTL. This explains why outbred animals can providehigh-mapping resolution. \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group 280|APRIL 2005 |VOLUME 6 www.nature.com/reviews/geneticsREVIEWS mosaic structure, which is consistent with their deriva- tion from a relatively small number of Asian andEuropean stocks 95-97. There is little doubt that in silico mapping is effective for monogenic, highly penetrant mutations95,98,99.T h e crucial issue is whether in silico mapping performs well in detecting small-effect loci. Wiltshire and colleagueshave gone the furthest towards this goal. They used adense map (of 10,990 SNPs) that was typed in 48 strainsand applied a permutation method to determine the sig-nificance of their results 99.They demonstrated the effec- tiveness of the method for localizing large effects (oncoat colour and taste preference) and then showed that for two multigenic complex traits (high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol levels and gallstone forma-tion) they could find loci that corresponded to somepreviously identified QTLs. These results are encour-aging,although further work is required to distinguish between true- and false-positive findings. At present, two difficulties confront in silico map- ping: low power and the complex structure of thegenomes of laboratory strains. At first sight, the problemof power seems to be insuperable: how can the geneticbasis of complex traits be dissected with just a few dozenanimals, or even a few 100, when we know that success-ful association studies in humans requires thousands ofindividuals 77? The truth of this analogy depends on the extent to which the inbred strains are related by descent. Ifthe inbred strains are completely unrelated, the anal- ogy is correct and thousands of animals will be neededfor genetic mapping. This is partly because there will beless LD between loci in unrelated individuals, so thatmore markers are needed to detect the QTL 77.M o r e unlinked markers will require an increase in the strin-gency of the significance threshold to avoid false-positiveresults, which in turn requires an increase in the number of animals to maintain power for QTL detection.However,more animals are also needed because, in fully outbred populations, more loci ar e likely to contribute to the genetic variance. Therefore, the relative contributionto the phenotypic variance that is attributable to a single locus will be less than for the same locus in a populationHaplotype analysis and in silico mapping Many have pointed out that a QTL must be contained in a region where sequence divergence corresponds togenetic action. So, when QTLs have been mapped in dif-ferent combinations of inbred-strain crosses, the straindistribution pattern can be combined with mapping datato refine the region that contains the functional vari- ant 68,88-90.For example, a QTL identified in a cross between strain A and strain B that does not segregate ina cross between strains A and C will be located wheresequences from strains A and C are the same, but thosefrom strains A and B are different. This approach hasbeen used to carry out mapping at an extremely highresolution and to identify candidate genes 68,88-90. A development of this idea is in silico mapping (BOX 4) . It relies on known phenotypic differences between inbred strains (such as those being collected as part of the MousePhenome Project 91;see the Mouse Phenome Database in the Online links box) and uses a high density of markersto derive a strain distribution pattern that can be used for mapping 92.The proponents of this method argue that it reduces the time required for analysis of genetic models of complex disease \"from many months to milliseconds\"92. In principle, in silico mapping is similar to mapping using RI lines \u2014 by establishing phylogenetic relation-ships between inbred strains from sequence informa-tion it should be possible to identify regions that areidentical by descent. The problem is that in contrast to aset of RI strains (or indeed all mapping experimentsthat are derived from crosses between inbreds), in whichgenotyping unambiguously defines descent so thatgenetic identities can be associated with phenotypicsimilarities, finding sequence variants that are shared bya set of inbreds does not guarantee their descent from acommon ancestor. Nevertheless, several observations support the treat- ment of inbred strains as if they were derived from a setof founder strains. For example, the genealogies ofmany inbred strains can be traced back to a relativelysmall number of animals 93,94.Moreover, the pattern of sequence variation between inbred strains initially indi-cated that the distribution of polymorphisms has aHAPLOTYPE SHARING Sets of closely linked genetic variants in different individualsthat are identical by descentaround a locus.Box 4 | QTL mapping using recombinant inbred lines versus in silico mapping Because recombinant inbred (RI) panels are descended from (us ually) two inbred strains, their genomes are random mosaics of these founder haplotypes. Once established, an RI panel need only be genotyped once, using markers thatdistinguish between the founder strains. At a given marker, the pattern of genotypes across the panel is called a straindistribution pattern. For example, in a panel of eight RI strains, the SDP 0100111 means that the first, third and fourthstrains carry the allele '0' and the remainder the allele '1' at the marker in question. To map a quantitative trait locus, RIanimals across the panel are phenotyped (if possible, in replicate, to reduce non-genetic variance), and the values arecorrelated with the strain distribution patterns at each marker (see the Gene Network web site in the Online links box) to identify markers with statistically significant associations. Mapping resolution depends on the size of the panel, but isroughly equivalent to that of an intercross. Superficially, in silico mapping looks similar. A set of inbred strains (that have an unclear ancestry) replaces the panel of RI strains of known ancestry. An important difference is that regions of HAPLOTYPE SHARING between the inbred strains must first be predicted from runs of contiguous markers with shared genotypes. The inbred strains are phenotyped and correlated with the predicted haplotype distribution patterns as before. Because the blocks of haplotype sharing between inbreds are smaller than in RI lines, theoretically in silico mapping resolution should be greater for the same number of strains. The key difference is that mapping using RI lines is by descent, but is by inferred state for in silico mapping. RI mapping is uncontroversial; by contrast, the merits of in silico mapping are hotly debated. \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group NATURE REVIEWS |GENETICS VOLUME 6 |APRIL 2005 |281REVIEWS The power of in silico mapping will vary along the genome depending on the complexity of the pattern ofsequence variation. There will be effects on both powerand resolution, depending on the number of progenitorgenomes that are assumed to give rise to the inbredstrains and on the size of the blocks of sequence identity.Although initial surveys of polymorphisms haverevealed an apparently simple pattern of relatively large blocks of sequence similarity and difference, detailedanalyses of multiple strains show that contiguous straindistribution patterns are different, but consistent withthe same phylogenetic tree. FIGURE 3 shows a representative example of the com- plexities that have been discovered in a single 2-Mbregion on mouse chromosome 1 (REF. 38) .In the right half of the figure, the structure is relatively simple;without too much loss of information, the distribu- tion of sequence variants can be modelled as if thegenomes were descended from just two progenitorstrains, with one str ain distribution pattern acc ounting for 93% of the variants. In this case, in silico mapping could detect QTLs (assuming that an adequate num- ber of strains has been analysed). However, themethod cannot resolve QTLs into an interval that issmaller than the block (which in this case is about 1 Mb). By contrast, the left half of the figure shows amuch more complex structure, with several str ain dis- tribution patterns t hat alternate in an unpredictable fashion, but are still consistent with the same phylo-genetic tree. Much higher mapping resolution will beobtained in this area, but with some loss in the powerto detect QTLs. The analysis of sequence variation described above was carried out using just eight strains, but we expect thatthe results can be extrapolated to accommodate morestrains. Importantly, the full complexity of the structurewas only revealed when near-complete sequence infor-mation became available. If the structure is mis-specified,as is likely with a low density of markers (which in thisparticular region would be more than about 10 kb apart),differences between strains will not be identified and sothe power to detect QTLs will be reduced. In silico mapping is an intriguing and attractive method, but it does require the ability to infer identi-cal sequences unequivocally when neighbouringgenotypes are the same. The recent announcementthat 15 inbred mouse strains are to be resequencedof individuals who have common ancestors (BOX 1) . However,as we have seen, inbred strains do share ancestors, so their degree of genetic relatedness is notequivalent to that in outbred humans. To obtain a lower limit on the number of animals needed to detect a genetic effect by in silico mapping, assume that all inbreds are derived from just two prog-enitors; in other words, assume the inbreds are a set ofRI lines. Using a standard equation to calculate thenumber of RI lines required to map a QTL, Darvasi argued that between 40 and 150 inbred strains wouldprovide 50% power to detect a QTL that explains5-20% of phenotypic variation in an F2 cross 42.S o , the smallest number needed to obtain sufficient power willbe about 50 animals. However, it will almost certainly bemore than that, because inbreds are not as closelyrelated to each other as a set of RI lines. Nevertheless, Peltz and colleagues claimed that they could detect QTLs using data from just eight inbred strains. They make the point that by phenotyping moreanimals it is possible to increase the heritability byreducing measurement error 100.The drawback to this argument is that, even if all environmental noise couldbe removed in this way, the individual effect of eachQTL will still be limited by the number of other QTLs that contribute to phenotypic variation. Good estimatesof the average number of QTLs and their relative contri-butions to a typical complex trait are hard to come by,but assuming an exponential distribution of effect sizes,our own data on behavioural measures yield a mean of7 QTLs (with an upper limit of 14 using a 95% confi-dence interval (REF. 101) ). So, given the known distribu- tion and effect sizes of QTLs, it is extremely unlikely thata single effect accounting for more than 20% of the phe-notypic variance will occur in a comparison of inbredstrains. Therefore, we can be reasonably certain thatto tackle genetically complex phenotypes successfully, in silico mapping will require much larger numbers of strains than have so far been analysed. The second difficulty for in silico mapping concerns the structure of the genomes of inbred strains. Is thedegree of mosaicism sufficient to satisfy the assump-tions of the mapping method? The idea that large seg-ments of the genomes of inbred mice maintained theirsequence identity over many megabases has recentlybeen modified by several publications that describe amuch more complex picture 37,102,103.Figure 3 | Haplotype complexity in inbred strains of mice. 700 variants with a strain distribution pattern frequency >1% between eight inbred strains across a 2-Mb region of mouse chromosome 1 are shown. The region is represented along thehorizontal axis and scaled so that the nth coordinate from the left edge corresponds to the nth variant. The alternating grey and white tracks show the spatial arrangement of the 13 most common strain distribution patterns. Each track represents one straindistribution pattern, a bar on the track shows where the corresponding variant has that strain distribution pattern. The strain s are A/J, AKR, BALB/cJ, C3H, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, I and RIII. The data presented are from REF. 37 . \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group 282|APRIL 2005 |VOLUME 6 www.nature.com/reviews/geneticsREVIEWS guarantee that the physical coincidence of gene expres- sion and QTL mapping data mean the two are causallyrelated. This is a problem for Peltz and colleagues, who claim to have identifie d an allele-specific functional genomic element that regulates the expression of thehistocompatibility 2, class II antigen E- gene ( H2-Ea ) 98. In silico mapping was used to map H2-Ea expression variation to a 1-kb block that lies within the first intronof the gene, followed by in vitro assays to identify a putative 45-bp regulatory element. But differentialexpression of H2-Ea is caused by several mechanisms, including a loss-of-function deletion of 600 bp in thepromoter and first exon of the H2-Ea gene 111,112. Quantitative complementation Quantitative complementation, or QTL-knockout interaction, which was originally for QTLwork in Drosophila by Trudy MacKay 113,is a method for testing the candidacy of a gene at a QTL. It is oblivious to the nature and position of the responsible sequence variant, a feature that is both its strength and weakness,because whereas one interpretation of a positive result isallelism to the QTL, another is epistasis. Strictly speaking,the test is not complementation in its classical formbecause it is testing for an interaction between the nullallele and the QTL, rather than for a main effect of either.For this reason, the name QTL-knockout interaction test is preferable, as suggested by Darvasi 114. The experimental design is simple \u2014 it requires off- spring from four crosses. An inbred animal bearing oneQTL allele (for example 'high') is mated to an inbred animal with a null allele of the gene of interest ('m') andalso to the co-isogenic wild-type animal ('wt'). A similarpair of crosses is established, but this time using aninbred strain with the alternative QTL allele ('low'). mean phenotype between is greater than that between thehigh/wt and low/wt genotypes then we have evidence ofquantitative failure of the mutation to complement theQTL alleles. This is detected as a statistical 'cross' (m or wt) by 'line' (high or low) interaction in a two-way analysis of variance. One biological interpretation of asignificant interaction is that the expression of the wild-type (that is, functional) gene is modulated by a QTL allele on the homologous chromosome. The test doesnot implicate any particular QTL, which could be any-where on the genome where the high and low strainsdiffer. QTL-knockout interaction tests require co-isogenic wild types, which can be difficult to obtain in mice. Knockouts created in a 129 strain are usually back- crossed onto a different strain (typically C57BL/6) sothat often, no pure co-isogenic wild type is available.However,when the experimenter has only the hybrid to work with, the problem of mixed background can sometimes be overcome by taking advantage of themosaic nature of the mouse genome: some regions ofthe 129 strain will be identical to the strain ontowhich it has been backcrossed. Where the targetedgene occurs in such a region (or in a region that isknown from genetic crosses not to carry QTLs thatmeans that questions about appropriate marker den- sity will soon be addressed (see the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Press Releases web site), but the potential of in silico map- ping will only materialize when we have the completesequences of more than 50 inbred strains. Gene-expression profiling Few strategies even attempt to turn a QTL from a locus into a molecular variant, which highlights the difficultyin confirming the role of a gene in a complex pheno-type. Gene-expression profiling is not a method for QTL detection by itself, but when combined with genetic mapping data it can help to identify candidates,even for behavioural phenotypes 104. In most examples, researchers have compared the gene-expression profiles of inbreds and congenics, toreduce the number of background strain differences and to leave just a small number of genes for furtherconsideration. The good news is that relatively few differences are found, even when a large chromosomesegment is derived from two genetically distantstrains 105.Gene-expression profiling identified the fatty-acid translocase gene CD36 as a QTL that affects insulin fatty-acid metabolism, an example that otherresearchers have attempted to emulate, with varying degrees of success: complement factor 5 has been sug-gested as a gene at a QTL that influences susceptibilityin a model of asthma 106,lipoxygenase ( Alox15) has been proposed as a candidate gene for bone mass107, an interferon-inducible gene for susceptibility to anautoimmune condition (systemic lupus) 108and glu- tathione S-transferase M2 has been identified as a gene that might be involved in hypertension109. Although this method has strengths, there are also several caveats. First, differential gene expression is notalways a marker of a QTL. Variants that alter proteinstructure might not alter expression levels, or therecould be compensatory mechanisms that obscure the effect of a QTL on expression. T odd and colleaguesused microarray analysis to study a model of type I dia-betes and reported that disease protection that is con-ferred by each of three known loci was not reflected inglobal effects on the non-induced immune system, and that gene-regulatory systems seemed to be remarkablyrobust to genetic variation 105. Second, expression differences might be restricted to certain tissues or developmental stages. For example, expression of 5HT1a receptors (Htr1a) in the forebrain is required to modulate anxiety during embryonic and fetal life, but it is not required for the same task in adult ani-mals 110.Therefore, expression differences for genes that encode the serotonin receptor that are relevant to anxietywould not be detected in the adult brain, although the phenotype is assessed in the adult animal. Gene-expres-sion analyses will have to be carried out across a largenumber of tissues at different developmental times to determine whether the gene is differentially expressed. Third, finding a gene-expression difference within a relevant tissue in a relevant biochemical pathway does not prove the gene's candidacy at the QTL. There is no \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group NATURE REVIEWS |GENETICS VOLUME 6 |APRIL 2005 |283REVIEWS genetic architecture, rather than considering whether there is a strategy that can reduce the genetic basis ofany phenotype to a monogenic condition. High-resolution mapping of small-effect loci will undoubtedly benefit from some of the new resourceswe have reviewed. Although some, such as the use of CSS, do little more than accelerate QTL discovery, andothers, such as in silico mapping, make claims that have yet to be realized, there are grounds for opti-mism. The use of high-resolution mapping in outbredmice and the construction of a large set of RI strains(the Collaborative Cross), combined with RISTs, and once thesequences of many inbred strains are available, in silico mapping could become a powerful tool. Nevertheless,even the ability to map down to under a kilobase willnot always deliver genes into the hands of researchers.The availability of whole-genome analyses, at the levelof both sequence variation and gene expression, caninduce a hubris which blinds us to the fact that com-plex phenotypes continue to frustrate genetic analysis. This is one reason why we have stressed gene iden- tification as a goal for QTL mapping \u2014 we lackmethods that deliver genes. Almost all the methodswe discuss are genetic mapping strategies that chase the segregating sequence variants that are responsiblefor a QTL; they do not directly find genes. It is not ourintention to diminish the importance of characteriz-ing sequence variants, as there are cases where we willneed to know the causal SNP (or whatever other formthe molecular pathology takes). Instead, we wish tomake it clear that the two goals are not necessarily thesame. Stated simply, finding the QTN does not neces-sarily give us the quantitative trait gene. One explana-tion for the subtle effects of QTLs is that they lie inregulatory regions (the sequence features of which are poorly understood) that can lie at a considerable dis-tance from cognate transcriptional units. For hedgehog ( Shh) is expressed at an ectopic site. Characterization of the mutant led to the identification ofan Shhenhancer element that lies within intron 5 of a novel gene, and is also involved in limb development(limb region 1 ( Lmbr1 ) 128), that is situated 1 Mb from Shh129,130.Consider what could happen if a QTL had been found at this regulatory region: the obvious, but erro-neous, conclusion would be that the Lmbr1 gene was the quantitative trait gene. The transition from locus to gene remains a formi- dable task. None of the strategies we have reviewedhere provide a comprehensive solution to gene identi-fication after QTL mapping. Simple approaches, suchas investigating the phenotype of the knockout, willadd weight to the candidature of the gene, but will notprove it. Definitive studies, such as the targeted inter-change of nucleotides between two strains, will prove that a sequence variant operates as a QTL, but will notunambiguously identify a gene. For that, we still needfunctional assays that make few assumptions aboutthe biology of candidate genes (for example, whereand when they are expressed, and at what levels).influence the trait of interest), and the rest of the 129 strain has been removed by repeated backcrossing,then it should be possible to find an appropriate co-iso-genic wild type. For example, by extensive resequencingof the 129, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains, we showed thatinbred C57BL/6 could be combined with a targetedmutation of the Rgs2 gene in a quantitative complemen- tation test 31.This arduous task can be avoided in the future once the relevant strains have been fully rese-quenced. Alternatively, knockouts could be made andmaintained on a single background or obtained byscreening the DNA of mutagenized inbred mice 115. Conclusion Throughout this review we have emphasized twopoints: the importance of being able to resolve QTLsthat contribute to less than 5% of the phenotypicvariance into small regions and the need for methodsthat identify genes, not sequence variants, at the QTL. We stress the first point because success stories in QTL cloning have identified genetic loci with atypi- cally large effects that have obviously functionalsequence changes. Therefore, an expectation hasarisen that loci with smaller effects can be character-ized using extensions of the same strategies: moremice, more congenics and more expression arrays.However,methods that work for large-effect QTLs are not well suited to finding genes that underlie mostQTLs. Not only do most QTLs typically have small effects 116,but the type of sequence variant responsible, even when it occurs in a coding region, is also hard to recog nize36,and the expression differences, if present, are subtle105. Given its importance for determining the success of QTL cloning, it is perhaps surprising that so littleattention has been paid to emerging clues that revealconsiderable variation in the genetic architecture of phenotypes. It seems that the number of loci, theirrelative effects, and how they interact with each other and the environment, might vary considerablybetween phenotypes, indicating that some pheno-types might be more tractable to QTL cloning than others. For example, it is striking that susceptibility toinfectious disease in inbred strains has frequentlyturned out to be due to large genetic effects, and,where characterized, to null alleles or coding-sequencemutations 117-122.Why this should be the case, when other apparently equally complex phenotypes (suchas hypertension, drug responses and obesity) havemuch more complex genetic architecture, is unclear, but it might be a consequence of the nature andextent of the selective pressure that is exerted by infec- tious agents. There are also differences in the extent towhich gene-by-gene interactions (epistasis) shape aphenotype. Pervasive epistatic effects have been docu-mented in some autoimmune conditions 123,m o r p hol- ogy124and in susceptibility to some cancers125,126,b u t despite intensive searches, the genetic architectureunderlying fear-related phenotypes consists almostentirely of additive effects 127.QTL cloning strategies need to accommodate all these possible types of \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group 284|APRIL 2005 |VOLUME 6 www.nature.com/reviews/geneticsREVIEWS in RNAi technology might aid functional investiga- tion of those cases in which QTLs operate by alteringexpression. It might soon be possible to reproduce naturally occurring variation, to abrogate the exp-ression of either parental mRNA, or to generate null alleles on the appropriate background for gene-knockout interaction testing. The challenge for the coming years is to develop new technologiesthat will accelerate gene identification after detectionof a QTL.Among the approaches described here, only the gene-knockout interaction test comes close to meetingthe necessary requirements. Where a null allele of therelevant gene can be found, and an appropriate co-iso- genic strain is available, the test provides a simple testof candidacy and interpretation of a positive result,allelism or epistasis provides important information.The current drawback is the lack of appropriatemutants, but this might change with plans to knock out all mouse genes 131.F u r thermore, developments 1.
