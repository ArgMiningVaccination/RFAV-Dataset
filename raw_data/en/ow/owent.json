Tiny needles are gently placed at specific points on the body to stimulate a response. These points are along Meridians, or channels of energy of the body, and often trace the paths of major nerves and vessels. These points have been well established in humans for centuries, and have been mapped in animals, making acupuncture one of a variety of therapies in veterinary medicine. Acupuncture is generally safe in the hands of a trained veterinarian. Proper diagnosis of the problem is critical to the safety and efficacy of the treatment. Its important to use a Certified Veterinary Acupuncturist (CVA) for the most safe and effective treatment. Acupuncture and holistic medicine are used to treat a number of health issues including joint problems (hip dysplasia and arthritis), neurologic issues (intervertebral disk disease), behavioral disorders (obsessive-compulsive licking), cancer, and allergies. Acupuncture is also used to treat gastrointestinal problems, reproductive disorders, immune system regulation, and urinary disorders. In addition, Acupuncture is used for pain management and can be helpful in reducing or eliminating the need for costly medications which can have adverse side effects. The treatment plan is developed after the Certified Veterinary Acupuncturist has evaluated your pet and established a diagnosis. Plans usually include weekly or bi-weekly acupuncture sessions for 4 to 8 weeks. Some positive response is usually seen within the first 3 treatments. Once maximum response is observed (determined by the pet owner and doctor) treatments are spaced out to the longest interval that keeps the condition under control. Many patients do very well on maintenance of 2 to 4 visits per year, but some pets require monthly treatments. Holistic medicine, including acupuncture, can be used as a primary treatment option or integrated with traditional veterinary medicine. The approach will vary based on the pet's medical condition. If your pet has a doctor other than your acupuncturist, its important to let both doctors know what treatments are used and any changes to the treatment plan.
