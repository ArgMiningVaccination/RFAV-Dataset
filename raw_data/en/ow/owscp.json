It is also known that antibodies are produced in the body after infection with COVID-19, but at this moment, it is not clear how much antibody is produced, how long it will last, and whether immunity can be acquired or not. Therefore, even if you find that you do not have antibodies to COVID-19, it does not mean that you are not infected with COVID-19 or that you have not been infected in the past. Tests and Diagnosis Q1What tests are being used to diagnose COVID-19? Tests for diagnosing COVID-19 include PCR Test, Quantitative Antigen Test, and Qualitative Antigen Test. These tests are all designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus (which caused COVID-19) in one's body and therefore can be used to see if someone is currently infected with the virus. Antibody tests are only used to see if a person has previously been infected with COVID-19. Antibody tests are not for use to diagnose acute infection.

Vaccines Q1What are the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines approved in Japan? The vaccines are effective in preventing the onset, infection and severe illness from COVID-19. Although the protection from infection and symptom onset may gradually decrease over time, it has been reported that the effectiveness in preventing serious symptoms remains comparatively high.

People who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant are also eligible. Vaccination is recommended regardless of the time of pregnancy.

Side Effects of vaccination Q1Who should I consult about side effects after COVID-19 vaccination? Talk to your doctor or contact point for consultation about long-term side effects.
