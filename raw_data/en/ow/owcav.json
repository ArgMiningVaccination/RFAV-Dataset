A harmless practice or well-intentioned witchcraft? Does the Bible have anything to say on the matter? Acupuncture has existed for more than 2,500 years. It's a traditional Chinese treatment using needles to stimulate the flow of chi (life energy) in the body. According to Hopkins Medicine, \"Acupuncture points stimulate the central nervous system. This, in turn, releases chemicals into the muscles, spinal cord, and brain. These biochemical changes may stimulate the body's natural healing abilities and promote physical and emotional well-being\" (2023). Read: [Could a Demon be Living Inside of Me?](https://pastorvlad.org/inside/) Origins of Acupuncture This practice started with a popular Chinese religion called Taoism. This religion promotes living in harmony with Tao. Tao is \"the way\", the stream of the universe, the power, the energy, behind the natural order. In Taoism, sickness disrupts the balance system of \"yin and yang.\" Yin and Yang are opposite powers, elements that complement each other like light and darkness or life and death. They believe that through the body's flow of energy or chi, this free energy flows through 12 invisible energy lines. These lines connect to organs in the body. This is not scientific but a purely spiritual belief. This practice claims to cure everything from migraine headaches to depression. The traditional acupuncture text is Nei Ching, inspired by the astrological and occult religious concepts of the day. With a topic like this, there are many who say it's simply a medical and holistic approach to healing but others would steer clear of it because of the deeply tied spiritual beliefs that accompany it. Is It Demonic? Despite your current belief, take time to read this testimony I came across from a doctor who wrote to Derek Prince. He states the following: \"About eight years ago, at a retreat in Singapore, God spoke to me about the dangers of acupuncture and its link to the occult, especially its inseparable origin with traditional Chinese religion. I immediately renounced my practice of acupuncture-a skill I learned in Hong Kong and practiced successfully for five years. As soon as I came back home, I announced to my startled staff of doctors, nurses, and patients that acupuncture is dangerous and that I had renounced it and would not practice it anymore. I gathered all my machines, needles, books, diploma, and charts and made a great bonfire of them publicly. The total cost of the items was about $15,000-but the blessings after that were priceless because My wife, who had suffered from chronic migraine and had acupuncture, done by me many times before, was immediately healed without medicine or prayer; even the unexplained fear of darkness immediately vanished. My medical practice, instead of suffering a loss, received a double fold increase in blessings. About three years ago we saw a very unusual case during a healing rally in Kuching, East Malaysia. A Christian lady came forward for prayer regarding her rheumatism. As soon as we started, the Lord gave a word of knowledge that she had submitted herself to acupuncture treatment in the past. She confirmed it, but each time she tried to renounce it, she was thrown onto the floor screaming in severe pain. We realized that she was being tormented by demons that had gained entry to her body through acupuncture. After we took authority over the demons and cast them out in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, she was delivered and totally healed. She then told us that each time she had tried to renounce acupuncture, invisible needles began to pierce her over the parts of her body where she had previously submitted herself to treatment.\" Final Thoughts As someone who ministers deliverance, I take testimonies like this seriously. Especially when the practices bring about supernatural results. If you are practicing acupuncture and attaching to its spiritual beliefs, I would be cautious because you might be opening up doors to the demonic. I would recommend Christians to steer clear of this practice due to its strong spiritual beliefs. Sources: Acupuncture. Acupuncture | Johns Hopkins Medicine. (2023, March 13).
