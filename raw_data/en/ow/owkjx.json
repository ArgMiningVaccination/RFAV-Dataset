Chiropractic Sunrise Page 1 THE SUNRISE REVIEW PROCESS A sunrise review is an evaluation of a proposal to change the laws regulating health professions in Washington. The Washington State Legislature's intent, as stat ed in chapter 18.120 RCW, is to permit all qualified people to provide health serv ices unless there is an overwhelming need for the state to protect the interests of the public by restricti ng entry into the profession. Changes to the scope of practice shoul d benefit the public. The Sunrise Act (RCW 18.120.010) says a health car e profession should be regulated or scope of practice expanded only when: Unregulated practice can clearly harm or endange r the health, safety or welfare of the public, and the potential for the harm is easily rec ognizable and not remote or dependent upon tenuous argument; The public needs and can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of initial and continuing professional ability; and The public cannot be effectively protected by other means in a more cost-beneficial manner. If the legislature identifies a need and finds it necessary to regulate a health profession not previously regulated, it should select the least restrictive alternative method of regulation, consistent with the public interest. Five types of regulation may be cons idered as set forth in RCW 18.120.010(3): 1. Stricter civil actions and criminal prosecutions. To be used when existing common law, statutory civil actions, and crim inal prohibitions are not suffici ent to eradicate existing harm. 2. Inspection requirements . A process enabling an appropriate st ate agency to enforce violations by injunctive relief in court, including, but not limited to, regu lation of the business activity providing the service rather than the employ ees of the business, when a service being performed for people involves a hazard to the public health, sa fety or welfare. 3. Registration. A process by which the state maintain s an official roster of names and addresses of the practitioners in a given profe ssion. The roster contains the location, nature and operation of the health care activity practices and, if required, a descrip tion of the service provided. A registered person is subject to the Uniform Di sciplinary Act (chapter 18.130 RCW). 4. Certification . A voluntary process by which the state grants recognition to a person who has met certain qualifications. Non-certified people may perform the same tasks, but may not use \"certified\" in the title. 1 A certified person is subject to the Uniform Disciplinary Act. 5. Licensure. A method of regulation by wh ich the state grants permissi on to engage in a health care profession only to people who meet predetermined qualifications. Licensure protects the scope of practice and the title. A licensed person is subject to the Uniform Disciplinary Act. 1 Although the law defines certification as voluntary, many health care professions have a mandatory certification requirement such as nursing a ssistants-certified, home care ai des, and pharmacy technicians.

Chiropractic Sunrise Page 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background Chiropractors have been licensed in Washi ngton since 18.25 RCW and Chiropractors experts in providing spinal mani pulation. In Washington, they're authorized to diagnose, analyze a nd treat \"the vertebral subluxation complex and its effects, articular dysfunction, and musculoskeletal disorders, all fo r the restoration and maintenance of health and recognizing the recuperative powers of the body. As part of the ch iropractic differential diagnosis, a chiropractor shall perform a physical examination to determine the appropriateness of chiropractic care or the need for referral to other health care providers.\"2 Chiropractic care doesn't include prescriptive authority; procedures involving the application of sound, diathermy or electricity; or any form of venipuncture. There are currently 2,348 licensed chiropractors in Washington. 3 Requirements for licensure under RCW 18.25.020 include completion of \"not less than one-half of the requirements for a baccalaureate degree\" and graduation from a Council on Chiropractic Educ ation (CCE) accredited chiropractic school or college c onsisting of a course of study of not less than 4,000 classroom hours of instruction. In addition, app licants must pass the National Bo ard of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) examination.4 Proposal for Sunrise Review On May 23, 2013, Representative Eileen Cody, Chai r of the House Health Care and Wellness Committee, asked the department to conduct a sunr ise review of House Bi ll (HB) 1573 from the 2013 legislative session. This proposal would prohibit discrimination against chiropractors and require that licensed chiropractors be allowed to perform physical examinations for sports physicals and commercial drivers' licenses. The applicant for this proposal is the Washington State Chiropractic Association (WSCA). The applicant describes this proposal as a clarification of the scope of practice, not an increase. The applicant report assessing the criteria required in chapter 18.120 RCW included the intent to propose amendments to HB 1573 as follows: Remove reference to the Washington Inters cholastic Activities Association (WIAA); Apply the proposed legislat ion to all youth sports; Add an additional 18-hour trai ning and examination requirement (with an optional challenge to the examination for chiropractors with curr ent Diplomate American Chiropractic of Sports Physicians certification); Create an endorsement to licensure for those chiropractors with the additional qualifications to be able to perform pre-participation examinations (PPEs) for student athletes (although this was not clear in the propos al, the applicant made it clear during the pub lic hearing that it intends this to be an endorsement); and 2 RCW 18.25.005(3) 3 As of July 1, 2013 4 Some chiropractic programs, such as th e University of Western States in Ore gon and Palmer College in Iowa, provide up to 4,600 classroom hour s, exceeding the minimum requ irements in statute. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 4 Require federal motor carrier training for doc tors of chiropractic performing the physical examinations that meet the criteria of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. In addition, at the public hearing, the applicant's represen tative stated that there were additional amendments intended to occur last session to HB 1573 that would have included changes to the statutory definitions in the chiropractic scope of practice. The department is required to evaluate the propos al requested by the legislature. We will attempt to address both the proposal and the many changes later suggested by the applicant. Recommendations The department has determined that the sunrise cr iteria haven't been met in the three versions of the proposal submitted because: 1. The department doesn't support adoption of HB 1573 as written. HB 1573 doesn't amend the definitions of chiropractic or ch iropractic treatment or care in RCW 18.25.005. Physical examinations for stude nt athletes and commercial drivers are clearly not within the existing statutory scope of practice for chiropractors in Washington. 2. The department does not support the propos al submitted with the applicant report from the Washington State Chiropractic Asso ciation in July, which included a proposal to add additional educational requirements for chiropractors to perform physical examinations of student athl etes and commercial drivers. The applicant report also does not propose to amend the definitions of chiropractic or chiropractic trea tment or care in RCW 18.25.005. The applicant's proposal should not be en acted, even with the additional training it intends to include in amendment language, be cause the proposal still fails to amend RCW 18.25.005 to add the elements of a comprehensive physical examination to the chiropractic scope of practice. 3. The department does not support expanding the chiropractic scope of practice to include PPEs for student athletes and comme rcial motor vehicle examinations (CMV exams) for commercial drivers . Since the department interprets these physicals as outside the chiropractic scope of practice, we review ed whether changing the definitions in RCW 18.25.005 to expand the scope would meet the sunrise criteria. The department found potential risk of patient harm if PPEs and CMV exams are adde d to the chiropractic scope of practice. Specifically: Addition of PPEs and CMV exams would expand the chiropractic scope of practice well outside of the current scope of diagnos ing and treating conditions relating to the musculoskeletal system. PPEs and CMV exams are intended to be co mprehensive physical examinations, not cursory screenings. These exams are sometimes the only examination a person receives regularly. For students, this includes the opportunity to receive age- appropriate vaccinations, which chiropractors can't perform. Chiropractic educational programs do not include adequate focus on pharmacology, which is necessary in both t ypes of physical examinations. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 5 Although chiropractic training includes basic understanding of body and organ systems, including the cardiovascular system, the department is unable to find that it prepares chiropractors to potentially be th e sole evaluator of all or most medical conditions. The additional trainings proposed by the applicant do not appear to adequately bridge the gap in training, especially considering the range of education obtained by current licensees. The Diplomate American Chiropr actic of Sports P hysicians specialty certification training's primar y focus also appears to be on spinal and extremity manipulation, exercise physiology, and s ports-specific biomechanics without a corresponding focus on broader medical conditions and pharmacology. Examining a patient to evaluate his or he r overall health should be done by a primary care provider who can use their broad spect rum of training, clin ical residency, and experience to conduct the evaluations, and w hose daily practice includes functions of primary care.

Chiropractic Sunrise Page 7 SUMMARY OF INFORMATON Background Chiropractors have been license d in Washington since 1919 to dia gnose, analyze and treat \"the vertebral subluxation complex and it s effects, articular dysfunction, and musculoskeletal disorders, all for the restoration and maintenance of health and recognizing the recupe rative powers of the body.\" Chiropractors are experts in providing spinal manipulation. In Washington, chiropractors are regulated by the Chiropractic Quality Assurance Commission (commission) under chapter 18.25 RCW and chapter 246-808 WAC. \"As part of a chiropractic differential diagnosis, a chiropractor shall pe rform a physical examination...to determine the appropriateness of chiropractic care or the need for referral to othe r health care providers.\"5 Chiropractic care does not include prescriptive authority; appl ication of sound, diathermy or electricity; or any form of venipuncture. As of July 1, 2013, there were 2,348 licensed ch iropractors in Washingt on. Requirements for licensure under RCW 18.25.020 include completion of \"not less than one-half of the requirements for a baccalaureate degree\" and graduation from a CCE-accredited chiropractic school or college consisting of a course of study of not less than 4,000 classroom hours of instruction. In addition, applicants must pass the Nati onal Board of Chiropractic Exam iners (NBCE) examination. Proposal for Sunrise Review On May 23, 2013, Representative Eileen Cody, chai r of the House Health Care and Wellness Committee, asked the department to conduct a sunrise review on House Bill 1573 from the 2013 legislative session, which would prohibit discrimi nation against chiropractors and require that licensed chiropractors be allowed to perform phy sical examinations for sports physicals and commercial drivers' licenses. House Bill 1573, \"A n act relating to clarifying the prohibitions against discriminating agains t licensed chiropract ors,\" included the following language: \"The state and its political subdivisions, in cluding school districts, and all officials, agents, employees, or representatives th ereof, are prohibited from in any way discriminating against licensed chirop ractors in performing and receiving compensation for services covered by thei r licenses. Licensed chiropractors must be allowed to perform sports physicals for sc hool athletes and physical examinations required for commercial driver's licenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the state and its political subdivisions, and all officials, agents, employees, or re presentatives thereof, are prohibited from entering into any agreement or contract with any individua l, group, association, including the Washington inte rscholastic activities associ ation, or corporation which in any way, directly or indirectly, discri minates against licensed chiropractors in performing and receiving compensation for services covered by their licenses.\" On June 25, 2013, the Washington State Chiropractic Association (WSCA) submitted its applicant report assessing the criteria required in chapter 18.120 RCW. The applicant states this 5 RCW 18.25.005(3) Chiropractic Sunrise Page 8 proposal is a clarification of their scope of pr actice, not an increase. The applicant report included the intent to propose amendments to HB 1573 as follows: Remove reference to the WIAA; Apply the proposed legislat ion to all youth sports; Add an additional 18-hour trai ning and examination requirement (with an optional challenge to the examination for chiropractors with curr ent Diplomate American Chiropractic of Sports Physicians certification); Create an endorsement to licensure for those with the additional qualifications to be able to perform PPEs. (Although this was not clear in the proposal, the appl icant made it clear during the public hearing that it intends this to be an endorsement); and Require Federal Motor Carrier training for doctors of chiropractic performing the physical examinations that would meet the criteria of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Administration. In addition, the applicant stated at the public hearing that th ere were additional amendments intended to occur last session to HB 1573 that woul d have included changes to the definitions in the chiropractic scope of practice. Public Participation and Hearing The department received the request from the le gislature to conduct this sunrise review on May 23, 2013, and received the applican t report on June 25, 2013. Interested parties were notified of the sunrise review on June 28, and given the opp ortunity to provide written comments on the proposal through August 2. We posted the propo sal and all applican t materials to the department's website. A public hearing wa s held August 6, 2013. Written comments were accepted through August 2, and there was an additional comment period after the hearing through August 16. (See Appendix D for public hear ing transcript and Appendix E for written comments). We shared a draft report with the applicant and interested parties Octobe r 23 and invited rebuttal comments. The rebuttals and department respons es are summarized beginning on page 23 (full rebuttal comments are attached as Appendix H). Nine people testified at the hearing in support of the proposal and nine in opposition. In addition, we received 15 letters in support of the pr oposal and 23 in opposition. The following is a summary of the written and oral comme nts we received during our review. Support Themes in the oral and written co mments in support of the proposal: This was just an oversight in the st atute that physicals weren't included. It's discrimination against chiropractors that they cannot perform these physicals. Chiropractors are well trained and fully prep ared to conduct these physicals. They have access to all medical diagnostic tools that are available to other health care providers. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 9 There's a misunderstanding about chiropractic education, diagnostic ab ility, and didactic training. Many opposing comments are emo tionally charged and hold no factual evidence. There's an access issue with primary care providers. Chiropr actors often help patients find primary care physicians who are accepting new patients. Many patients would prefer a certified sports trainer to do their physicals because they trust them, and their chiropr actors know their history. Chiropractors conduct PPEs for professional sports teams, Olympic teams, colleges, and high schools across America. It was suggested that the sunr ise reviewers might wish to vi sit one or more chiropractic colleges to observe the curriculum and the hands-on doctor/patient relationships being taught. Opposing comments attempt to engender conc ern and fear about potential negative outcomes associated with the proposal. Iro nically, the negative outcomes cited are associated with medical physicia ns' provision of these exams. Washington is one of the few remaining states that restrict chir opractors from performing physicals. It's a disservice to Washington residents. These are screenings, not treatment. The applicant offered a response to perceive d inaccuracies heard during testimony and to written testimony received by the department. (Appendix C). Opposed Themes in the oral and written co mments in opposition to the proposal: Chiropractors are not qualified and may miss critical issues. Chiropractic teaching falls short of teaching the necessary skill set, es pecially regarding the ability to diagnose simple or complex patterns of disease and inju ry. The lack of clinical training in cardiac pathologies and concussion evaluation c ould be devastating to a young athlete. PPEs should be completed by a medical doctor or medical clinician who has the training, background and skills to perform th em and recognize heart disease. All medical practitioners should stay w ithin their legal sc ope of practice. These visits may be the only time a child or teen sees his or he r doctor. The physical addresses the whole patient, and the ideal examiner is the primary care physician who knows a patient's medical history. It's a critical time to perf orm vaccinations, which chiropractors cannot do. In addition, chiropractors do not have prescriptive authority. The proposal is antithetical to efforts in th e medical community to improve athlete safety on the playing field. Extensive work is be ing done preventing sudden cardiac death based on trained evaluation of the history and physic al examination, proper use of non-invasive cardiovascular testing, and a solid understand ing of the conditions associated with sudden cardiac death in athletes. The proposal doesn't contain ap propriate oversight. It doesn' t support the team approach to medical care and the physician-led model. The Washington State Medical Association, Washington Osteopathic Medical Association, and Washington State Nurses Association wrote in opposition, citing inadequate training to provide comprehensive physical examinations. They also stated there isn't data supporting the need to expa nd the scope of practice due to a claimed Chiropractic Sunrise Page 10 shortage of primary care providers, nor is th e claim supported that this expansion would benefit the public. Sports physicals ascertain medi cal health status, not chiropractic health status; they should solely remain the professional re sponsibility of medical practitioners. The Athletic Trainers Associ ation asserts that chiropractic training doesn't emphasize the main issues that affect young athletes such as sudden cardiac arrest, heat-related illnesses, concussions and other medical issues. Education and Training RCW 18.25.025 authorizes the commission to grant accreditation to chirop ractic schools and colleges. The statute requires chiropractic educational program s to include minimum hours of chiropractic curriculum in the following areas: Principles of chiropractic - 200 hours; Adjustive technique - 400 hours; Spinal roentgenology Symptomalogy and diag nosis 425 625 hours. RCW 18.25.020 and WAC 246-808-040(3)(b) require chiropractic educational programs to be a minimum of 4,000 class hours of instruction over a four-year academic term . Some chiropractic programs, such as the University of Western St ates in Oregon and Palmer College in Iowa, include additional class hours. A ccording to the applic ant, these programs include 500 hours of anatomy, 400 hours of physiology, 1,500 hours of diagnosis, and 2,000 hours of clinic, where students see student-patients a nd patients from the surrounding communities under supervision. The University of Western States in Oregon and Palmer College of Chiropractic in Iowa submitted comments stating its programs prepare graduates to provide comprehensive health examinations. These colleges included the following information about their programs: Palmer College states that of the 4,620 to tal contact hours of in struction, 570 are in diagnosis, 300 are in radiol ogy procedures and interpreta tion, and 945 are in practical clinical experiences in the Palmer Chiropractic Clinic system.6 The University of Western States indicat es nearly 1,000 of their 4,200 to 4,600 hours of training covers all aspects of ambulatory ca re patient evaluation, and the analysis and employment of best practices therein. This education includes didactic and practical skills instruction in emergency procedures, physical examination of each body region and system, laboratory diagnosis, differential diagnosis, imaging, triage, evidence based practice, etc. In addition to di dactic instruction and practical application, clinical practice training rotations includ e extensive experience in the appl ication of these competencies on a very diverse array of patie nts in ambulatory care settings.7 Dr. Gary Schultz, representing the a pplicant at the hearing, stated th at chiropractors are trained in all the essential elements that are required in PPEs and CMV exams as a part of their core training. This training includes basic sciences, clinical sciences, and clinical experiences, which 6 Letter from Palmer College in response to proposal, dated August 30, 2013 7 Letter from University of Western States submitte d in response to proposal, dated July 26, 2013 Chiropractic Sunrise Page 11 incorporate all areas of the body. It isn't an education focused simply on the neuromuscular skeletal system, but he admits there is a focus in that area because it is the primary area of treatment for most chiropractors' practice. Dr. Schultz further stated that the very broad education prepares chiropractors to diagnose a ny condition that would likely walk through an ambulatory care center's doors. He said at the very least, chiropractors are responsible to be able know what they can and can't treat and to be ab le to refer appropriate ly for conditions they encounter that are not within their scope. We received many comments in response to this proposal stating that chiropractors have no training outside the musculoskeletal system. Our review of the documentation submitted by the applicant and others shows this to be an ove rsimplification. Current chiropractic programs provide broad medical training, including supervised clinical training; however, it is minimal in comparison to the substantial trai ning they receive in aspects of chiropractic care. In addition, chiropractic programs are not required to include training in pharmacol ogy. Some programs offer some training in this area, but the amount vari es from program to program. Chiropractic schools don't require clinical rotations sp ecific to areas such as family medicine, internal medicine, or pediatrics. There are voluntary specialty certifica tions for chiropractors that include: American Chiropractic Boar d of Sports Physicians: o Certified Chiropractic Sports Physician (CCSP) which includes 100 hours of class time. o The Diplomate American Chiropractic of Sports Physicians which requires a CCSP and an additional 200 class hours, 100 hours of practical experience, plus an examination. These specialty certifications include a small portion of br oad medical training, but the primary focus appears to be on spinal and extremity manipulation, as well as exercise physiology and sports-specific biomech anics or occupational treatment. The Department of Labor and Industrie s offers the following certifications:8 o Chiropractic Consultant Program . Chiropractors with additional clinical and workers' compensation-specific training may be certified to perform second opinion consultations for attending doctors to a ssist evaluation and care recommendations when a worker's recovery isn't meeting expectations. Training includes 180 post- graduate hours in subject areas such as diagnostic assessment, neurology, occupational health practices, and ort hopedics. Only 20 hours are allowed in chiropractic technique. o Independent Medical Examiner (IME) certification. Chiroprac tors with two years of experience as a chiropractic consultant a nd who have taken an IME seminar may be certified to provide an inde pendent assessment of a patien t's status, including rating for permanent impairment. 8 <http://www.lni.wa.gov/ClaimsIns/Pro viders/ProjResearchComm/IICAC/def ault.asp#4>, accessed September 11, 2013 Chiropractic Sunrise Page 12 This page left intentionally blank. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 13 Current Regulation and Practice of Chiropractors RCW 18.25.005 defines the chiropr actic scope of practice: (1) Chiropractic is the practice of health care that deals with the dia gnosis or analysis and care or treatment of the verteb ral subluxation complex and its effects, articular dysfunction, and musculoskeletal disorders, all for the restoration and maintenance of health and recognizing the recupera tive powers of the body. (2) Chiropractic treatment or care include s the use of procedur es involving spinal adjustments and extremity manipulation. Chiropractic treatment also includes the use of heat, cold, water, exercise, massage, trigger point therapy, dietary advi ce and recommendation of nutritional supplementation, the normal regimen and rehabilitation of the patient, first aid, and counseling on hygiene, sanitation, and prev entive measures. Chiropractic care also includes such physiological therapeutic procedur es as traction and light, but does not include procedures involving the application of sound, diathermy, or electricity. (3) As part of a chiropractic differential dia gnosis, a chiropractor shall perform a physical examination, which may include diagnostic x-ra ys, to determine the appropriateness of chiropractic care or the need for referral to other health care provide rs. The chiropractic quality assurance commission shall provide by ru le for the type and use of diagnostic and analytical devices and procedures consistent with this chapter. (4) Chiropractic care shall not include the prescription or disp ensing of any medicine or drug, the practice of obstetrics or surgery, the use of x-rays or any other form of radiation for therapeutic purposes, colonic irriga tion, or any form of venipuncture. Chiropractors are currently requir ed to perform physical examina tions, but the purpose of those examinations is to determine the appropriateness of chiropractic care or the need for referral, not to assess the overall health of an individual. Current Washington law limits the practice of chiropractors to diagnosis, analysis, and care or treatment for restorati on and maintenance of health of conditions relating to the musculoskeletal system. Regulation in Other States Washington's chiropractic licensing requirements are similar to thos e in other states, some with much broader scopes of practice. However, public expectations, regulatory policy, and legislatively created scope of practice are quite different. Three other states were mentioned during testimony comparing scopes of practice: Oregon, Michigan and Colorado. This report focuses on those states for comparison, which show s the diverse regulatory policies regarding the practice of chiropractic these states have based on their authorizing environments. Michigan Of the three states, Michigan is most like Washingt on in its approach to th e chiropractic scope of practice. Michigan doesn't allow chiropractors to perform pre-particip ation examinations or commercial motor vehicle examinations exams. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 14 An opinion by Michigan Attorney General9 makes it clear that physic al examinations aren't within the scope of ch iropractic practice: Public health code doesn't include within chir opractic practice general physical examinations, including: analysis of blood, hair, urine samples, physical observations of throat, mouth, eyes, taking of pulse and blood pressures, and ex amination of lungs and abdomen, even if information such as that which can be ascert ained from urine specimens and blood pressure test would be helpful, if not health preserving, in preparation for chiropractic treatment, since statute limits scope of chiropractic in determ ining existing subluxations or misalignments of the spine. Michigan's chiropractic scope of practice statute is a part of Michigan Public Health Code (Excerpt) Act 368 of 1978, Section 333.16401: (e)\"Practice of chiropractic\" means that discipline within the healing arts that deals with the human nervous system and the musculoskeletal system and their interre lationship with other body systems. Practice of chiropractic includes the following: (i) The diagnosis of human conditions and di sorders of the human musculoskeletal and nervous systems as they relate to subluxati ons, misalignments, and joint dysfunctions. These diagnoses shall be for the purpose of detecting and correcting those cond itions and disorders or offering advice to seek treatment from other health professionals in order to restore and maintain health. (ii) The evaluation of conditions or symptoms related to subluxations, misalignments, and joint dysfunction through any of the following: Oregon Oregon has a required form and protocol for PPEs (ORS 336.479). PPEs are required for all students participating in extrac urricular sports in grades se ven through 12. ORS 336-479 Section 1 (5) (e) allows a licensed chiropr actor who \"has clinical traini ng and experience in detecting cardiopulmonary diseases and defect s\" to perform PPEs. The clinic al training and experience is assumed, by the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners, under the basic chiropractic licensing requirements. However, Oregon clearly has a different policy vi ew of chiropractic th an Washington. Oregon defines a chiropractic physician as an attending physician and allows ch iropractors to perform minor surgery and to use antiseptics and lo cal anesthetics in connection with surgery. 10 With additional certifications, they can perform proctology11 and natural childbirth.12 They are seen as primary care physicians and may sign birth and death certificates and co nduct school physicals.13 They also perform physicals required by the Un ited States Department of Transportation (USDOT). They may not \"administer or write pr escriptions for, or dispense drugs, practice optometry or naturopathic medicine or do major surgery\"(ORS 684.015 (3)). 9 Attorney General, on Behalf of People v. Beno (1985) 373 N.W.2d 544, 422 Mich. 293 10 <http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/684.html> 11 OAR 811-015-0030 (2) 12 OAR 811-015-0030(4) 13 Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners Chiropractic Sunrise Page 15 Colorado In Colorado, the rules regulating PPEs are left to individual schools or school districts or are delegated to the Colorado High School Athle tics Association (CHSAA ). Colorado High School Athletics Association requires PPE s to be conducted for student at hletic participation in middle school, junior high and high schools.14 For chiropractors to perform PPEs for junior high and high school student athletes in Colorado, CHSAA requires initial ce rtification and recertification every two years. The in itial certification class is seven continuing education hours and covers topics of patient history and physical examinati on, guidelines for student s ports participation in Colorado, and legal precautions.15 Colorado chiropractors may not perform surgery, practice obstetrics, treat cancer or prescribe legend drugs. Colorado chiropractors may perform an EKG/ECG if they have the required 120 hours of initial and related clinical with did actic training and demonstrated competency in cardiac medicine.16 Background on PPEs A PPE is a physical examination that is gene rally required of student athletes prior to participation in school sports. The go al is to help maintain the hea lth and safety of the athlete in training and competition. PPEs require evaluation of a wide range of body parts, such as eyes/ ears/nose/throat, lymph nodes, heart, lungs, abdome n, skin and genitourinary system (for males). They also require an assessment of conditions such as asthma, diabetes, hernia, and heart conditions. The examiner is expected to dete rmine whether a student athlete can safely participate in sports or whether clinical contraindicati ons to practice or participation exist. (See Appendix F for the authorization form recommended by the WIAA). These physical examinations have taken on more impor tance in recent years due to an increase in adverse events such as sudden cardiac deaths occurring in young athletes. An underlying or undetected heart condition that in creases the risk of sudden cardiac arrest is one of the serious concerns that often escape detection during a PPE. The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that approximately 2,000 people under the age of 25 die fr om sudden cardiac arrest in the United States each year. Student athletes r un a significantly greater chance of experiencing sudden cardiac arrest than a non-athlete of the same age.17 Sudden cardiac arrest usually stems from a structural/functiona l defect in the heart or an electrical disord er. About 40 percent are caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an ex cessive thickening of the heart muscle. Medical providers must be aware of the warni ng signs and symptoms of sudden cardiac death and respond appropriately with co mprehensive cardiovascular eval uation, referral, treatment, and activity restrictions. Work is being done on preventing sudden cardiac death based on trained evaluation of patient history a nd physical examination, proper use of non-invasive cardiovascular testing, and a solid understandi ng of the conditions associated with sudden cardiac death in athletes. The Nick of Time Foundation, a nonprofit organization de dicated to preventing sudden 14 Colorado High School Athletics Association, <http://www.chsaa.org/home/pdf/ StateStauteHandbook.pdf> 15 Colorado Chiropractic Association 16 Examiners 3 CCR 701-1 Colorado state Board of Chiropractic Examiners Rules and Regulations 17 Pediatrics, Volume 129, Number 4. April 2012. American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement Chiropractic Sunrise Page 16 cardiac arrest in athletes, is one organization that is working to re structure the PPE with stricter regulations. Many children being examined through PPEs have other diagnosed or undiagnosed medical conditions in addition to those on the standard PP E clearance form that ma y impact their ability to play sports safely. Many of these children are on medications for conditions such as asthma or attention deficit hyperactivity di sorder (ADHD), which may carry ri sk of drug interactions with other prescription and over-the-counter medications . In 2009, it was reported that over a quarter of children in the United States were taki ng at least one medica tion on a chronic basis.18 In addition, according to CDC prevalence rates: The national child asthma rate is 9.5percent,19 many of whom use at least a rescue inhaler; In 2007-2008, between 3.7 and 4.7 percent of children in Washington State were on medication for ADHD.20 Individual school districts in Washington have been given authority by the legislature to make rules regarding their interscholas tic activities, including PPEs. RCW 28A.600.200 states: \"Each school district board of di rectors is hereby granted and sh all exercise the authority to control, supervise and regulate th e conduct of interschool athletic activities and other interschool extracurricular activities of an athletic, cultural, social or recreational nature for students of the district. A board of directors may delegate control, supervision and regulation of any such activity to the Washington interscholastic activities associatio n or any other voluntary nonprofit entity and compensate such entity for services provided; subject to the following conditions . . .\" A school district may contract w ith the WIAA for administration of its athletic ac tivities. Although the WIAA includes in its handbook a sample form for school districts to use for PPEs, there is a wide variety in the forms actually used by the various school districts and the WIAA's 800-member high schools and middle /junior high schools. Background on Commercial Driver's License Physicals Commercial motor vehicle data shows that more than 3,000 truck crashes per year result from the driver having a heart attack or other physical impairment.21 A medical eligibility clearance (or CMV) exam is required to help prevent medi cally unqualified drivers fr om operating commercial vehicles on our highways. The CMV exam for interstate drivers includes many of the same items/conditions that are included in a PPE, such as cardiovascular conditions (Appendix G). These examinations also include requirements to evaluate and discuss mental health conditions, alcoholism, the effects of medications, and non-disqualifying medical conditions that require remedial care, including: 18 \"So Young and So Many Pills.\" The Wall Street Journal, December 28, 2010. Study co nducted by Medco Health Solutions Inc. 2009. 19 <http://www.cdc.gov/asthma/asthmadata.htm>, accessed September 11, 2013 20 <http://www.cdc.gov/ncbd dd/adhd/data.html>, acce ssed September 11, 2013 21 2007 Study by the Washington State Department of Licensing, <http://www.dol.wa.gov/driverslicen se/cdlmedicalcertificates.html> Chiropractic Sunrise Page 17 Possible side effects and interactions of prescription and over-the-coun ter medications that could negatively affect driving.22 Diabetes exemptions that may require blood glucose monitoring.23 Due to safety concerns, the USDOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has set up a required registry for all health care providers who wish to conduct these examinations for interstate drivers. It describes the registry as: The National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners (National Registry) is a new FMCSA program. It requires all me dical examiners (MEs) who wish to perform physical examinations for interstate commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers to be trained and certified in FMCSA physical qualification standards. Medical examiners who have completed th e training and successfully passed the test are included in an online directory on the National Registry website. 24 The medical examiner training reviews FMCSA- specific knowledge about CMV drivers and the physical and mental demands of the job. This tr aining is required because specialized knowledge of CMV drivers is not included in health care pr actitioner education and licensure requirements. The training ensures that candi dates have baseline in struction in FMCSA's CMV driver physical qualification standards, medical guidelines, and medical examiner responsibilities. Medical scope of practice is defined by each state and dem onstrates the practitioner's clinical knowledge. The medical examiner training bu ilds on that clinical knowledge a nd applies it to the fitness for duty determination for CMV drivers. If a licensed chiropractor is aut horized to perform general phys ical exams under state statute, they are able to complete the federal training a nd take the certification test to become a CMV examiner. 25 Forty-eight states allow chiropractors to perform CMV exams. Because the performance of physical examinations for reasons other than chiropractic care or referral to another health care provider is ou tside of the scope of practice for chiropractors in Washington as defined in RCW 18.25.005, chiropractors aren't eligib le for FMSCA registry. Definition of the Problem a nd Why Regulation is Necessary The applicant states that the problem it is tryi ng to remedy with the proposal is the arbitrary selection of which health care providers are allowed to perform PPEs and CMV exams in Washington. These physical examinations are cl early outside the exis ting chiropractic scope of practice. Allowing performance of these physicals would be a substan tial increase to the curr ent scope. This would require the examiner to take on the role of prim ary care provider, examining and diagnosing systems and issues of the whole body, including assessin g possible side effects and interactions of medications. Chiropractors have limited training in pharmacology and no prescriptive authority in 22 Medical Examination Report for Commercial Driver Fitness Determination Form # 649F (6045), <http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/safetyprograms/Medical-Report.pdf> 23 Medical Advisory Criteria for 391.41, <http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules- regulations/administration/medical.htm> 24 <https://nationalregistry.fmcs C.F.R. Section 390.5 Definitions, <http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-re gulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.aspx?reg=390.5> Chiropractic Sunrise Page 18 Washington. CMV exams may necessitate the examiner to make highly subject ive decisions, such as whether cardiovascular disease should disqualify an individual , or whether a diabetic whose condition is adequately controlled by medication and diet should be allowed to drive.26 The applicant states that chir opractic education prepares chir opractors to perform PPE exams competently. It states that many chiropractors pe rform cardiopulmonary exams in their offices on a daily basis; however, it acknowledges that not al l chiropractors have ma intained the level of competency to perform PPEs at the level they should be performed. This is the reason the applicant has stated it is reque sting the endorsement to only allow chiropractors with additional training and testing to perform PPE s. This specialty training incl udes an 18-hour course for PPEs or Diplomate American Chiropractic of Sports Physicians sports medi cine certification. The applicant states that chiropractors who don't specialize in PPEs and CMV exams will simply choose not to do them, just as medical doctors d on't perform every type of service within their scope of practice. In order to determine the adequacy of the endor sement proposed by the app licant, the department examined the core chiropractic training of curre ntly licensed chiropractor s. These practitioners may have been trained 30 years a go or last year, creating a wide diversity in training. In addition, even current chiropractic programs necessarily ha ve a primary focus on chiropractic treatment, leaving much less time devoted to primary medica l education. Some chiropractic programs like the University of Western States exceed the minimum accreditation requirements and incorporate a broader focus on medical training, but not all schools do the same. The department isn't convinced that the specialty certifications for sports medi cine chiropractors include enough focus on broad medical training to adequately address the gap. Concerns have been identified about how PPEs are currently be ing performed by other medical professions, including allegations that physicians miss underlying or undetected heart conditions that increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. These are concerns be yond the scope of this review. Expanding the chiropractic scope of pr actice won't address th ese issues. They are currently being debated in the br oader health care system and the discussions are leaning toward increased regulations for those pr oviders already performing them. 26 Medical Advisory Criteria for Evaluation Under 49CFR Part 391.41, <http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules- regulations/administration/medical.htm> Chiropractic Sunrise Page 19 REVIEW OF PROPOSAL US ING SUNRISE CRITERIA The Sunrise Act, chapter 18.120 RCW, does not sp ecifically address a proposal to modify or expand a profession's scope of practice; but RCW 18.120.010(2) states th at when considering regulating health professions for the first time , the profession should be regulated only when: Unregulated practice can clearly harm or endanger the health, safet y, or welfare of the public, and the potential for the harm is easily recognizable and not remote or dependent upon tenuous argument; The public needs and can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of initial and continuing professional ability; and The public cannot be effectively protected by other means in a more cost-beneficial manner. The department has applied the cr iteria in RCW 18.120.010(2) to HB 1573. First Criterion: Unregulated practice ca n harm or endanger health or safety. This criterion has not been met. Chiropractors are currently a th oroughly regulated pr ofession. The public health and safety benefit of adding PPEs and CMV exams to the chir opractic scope of practice hasn't been proven, and the potential for harm is pres ent. There is evidence that hi ghly trained providers currently conducting PPEs sometimes miss the warning signs of heart conditions, or do not perform PPEs properly. Allowing providers with less training to perform PPEs w on't alleviate this issue and may inadvertently compound the problem. Chiropractic schools include supervised clinical training in many areas, including recognition of cardiac conditions. However, it's minimal in comp arison to the substantial training they receive in aspects of chiropractic care; and not all curren tly licensed chiropractors receive this level of education. In addition, chiropractic programs aren't required to include training in pharmacology, although some programs offer some training in this area. The Diplomate American Chiropractic of Sports Physicians spec ialty certification has a strong focus on spinal and extremity manipulation, exercise physio logy and sports-speci fic biomechanics. Second Criterion: The public needs and will benefit from assurance of professional ability. This criterion has not been met. There are adequate laws and rules in place to assure the public of chiropractors' initial and continued professional ability for their current scope of practice. Chiropractors are clearly authorized to provide all aspects of care that deal with diagnosis or analysis and care of treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, including spinal adjustments, extremity manipulation, and other modalities. This includes physical examinations determining whether chiropractic treatment is appropriate or whether a referral is necessary to another heal th care provider. All licensed chiropractors have received training to provide these services. The three versions of the proposal under re view don't contain th is assurance because: Chiropractic Sunrise Page 20 They do not change the chiropractic sc ope of practice in RCW 18.25.005 to include comprehensive physical examinations. Even if the department recommended language to clearly add these examinations in the chiropractic scope of practice, the applicants have not shown adequate training and supervised clinical experience to assure the public of the professional ability of currently practicing chiropractors to pe rform PPEs or CMV exams. Chiropractors have limited training in pharmaco logy, which can play a significant part in both types of physical examinations. Third Criterion: Public protection cannot be me t by other means in a more cost beneficial manner. This criterion has not been met. Public protection is already in place with the curren t scope of practice of chiropractors. Although the applicant shared anecdotal st ories of children who could not fi nd a health care provider to perform a PPE, and has concerns that there ma y not be sufficient provi ders to perform CMV exams in the future, they haven't submitted actua l evidence that the public will be denied these services if this pr oposal isn't granted. Issues have been identified with the PPE. Thes e include studies showi ng that physicians don't always follow appropriate guideli nes and that critical health conditions are often missed. This seems to indicate a need for stricter regulations and guidelines for thos e already conducting the physicals to follow. None of the versions of the proposal considered address these issues. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 21 DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS TO LEGISLATURE In the course of the sunrise review, the departme nt considered three different versions of the proposal and determined the sunrise criteria have not been met: 1. The department does not support adoption of HB 1573 as written. Rationale: HB 1573 does not amend the definitions of chiropractic or chiropractic treatment or care in RCW 18.25.005. Physical examinations for student athletes and commercial drivers aren't within the current chiropractic scope of practice. 2. The department does not support the propos al submitted with the applicant report from WSCA in July, which included a proposal to add additional educational requirements for chiropractors to perform PPEs and CMV exams. Rationale: The applicant report also does not propose to amend the definitions of chiropractic or chiropractic treatment or care in RCW 18.25.005. The applican t's proposal shouldn't be enacted, even with the additional training it intends to include in amendment language because the proposal still fails to ame nd RCW 18.25.005 to add the elements of a comprehensive physical examination to the chiropractic scope of practice. 3. The department does not support expanding the chiropractic scope of practice to include PPEs and CMV exams . The legislature requested that the department assess whether the proposal meets the sunrise criter ia for expanding the scope of practice for chiropractors. The department interprets these physicals as outside the chiropractic scope of practice and they would be an expansion of that scope, as indicated in the request from the legislature. Therefore, we reviewed whether changing the definitions in RCW 18.25.005 expanding the scope to include these physic als would meet the sunrise criteria. Rationale: The department found potential risk of patient harm if PPEs and CMV exams are added to the chiropractic scope of practice. Specifically: Addition of PPEs and CMV exams would expand the chiropractic scope of practice well outside of their curren t capacity of diagnosing and treating conditions relating to the musculoskeletal system. PPEs and CMV exams are intended to be comprehensive medical examinations, not cursory screenings. These exams are sometimes the only examination the person receives regularly. For students, this includes the opportunity to receive age- appropriate vaccinations, which chiropractors can't perform. Chiropractic educational programs don't include adequate focus on pharmacology, which is necessary in both t ypes of physical examinations. Although chiropractic training includes basic understanding of body and organ systems, including the cardiovascular system , the department is unable to find that it prepares chiropractors to potentially be th e sole evaluator of all or most medical conditions. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 22 The additional trainings pr oposed by the applicant don' t appear to adequately bridge the gap in training, especially considering the range of education obtained by current licensees. The Diplomate American Chiropractic of Sports Physicians specialty certification training's primary focus also appears to be on spinal and extremity manipulation, exercise physiol ogy, and sports-specific biomechanics without a corresponding focus on broader medical conditions and pharmacology. Examining a patient to evaluate their ove rall health should be done by a primary care provider who can use their broad spect rum of training, clin ical residency, and experience to conduct the evaluation. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 23 REBUTTALS TO DRAFT REPORT The department shared a draft report and recommendations with interested parties and invited comments before finalizing the report. We receive d three letters of rebu ttal and one letter of correction that are summarized below. In addition, we received four letters in support of the draft recommendations. These letters aren't addre ssed below but are included in Appendix H. Applicants We received two letters of rebuttal from member s of the applicant group, Lori Grassi and Dr. Lorri Nichols. We'll summarize the rebuttals and corrections below, along with our response or actions. The full rebuttals are included in Appendix H. Lori Grassi 1. Correction: The applicant identified an error in the background sections of the report reflecting the date when chiropractors were first licensed in Washington. Department Response The department made an inadvertent error in this date in both the Executive Summary and Summary of Information sections of the report. The date was changed in both places to indicate chiropractors have b een licensed in our state since 1919. 2. Correction: The applicant identified an error in citations where the department used the term \"may\" in relation to chiropractors perf orming physical examinations to determine the appropriateness of chiropractic care or the need for referral to other health care providers. Department Response This was also an inadvertent error. The de partment was aware that the statute (RCW 18.25.005(3)) uses the term \"shall.\" We have corrected the report to indicate that chiropractors are required to perform these types of examinations to determine the appropriateness of chiropractic care or the need for referral to othe r health care providers. 3. Information from Hearing: The applicant was concerned that the department didn't include information it provided at the public hearing about intended amendments that didn't make it into HB 1573 last session th at would have included changes to the definitions. Department Response The department has added the applicant's stated intent into the report. However, one of the three versions of the proposal we revi ewed included expanding the scope of practice under appropriately amended definitions. Our task in this sunrise review was to review the proposal submitted. We cast a broad net in what we evaluated based on Representative Cody's directi on that we provide \"an assess ment of whether the proposal meets the sunrise criteria for expanding the sc ope of practice,\" in he r request for sunrise review that we provide Chiropractic Sunrise Page 24 4. Correction: The applicant identified an inaccuracy regarding pharmacology training, where the department had stated that chiropractors don't have training in pharmacology. The applicant stated that chiropractors do ha ve pharmacology in their core curriculum and that they review all prescription and ove r-the-counter medications as part of their basic intake and examination. The applican t specifically referenced the 2013 CCE Accreditation Standards, wher e it states that \"toxicology\" is required as part of the clinical sciences requirements, which include, physical, clinical and laboratory diagnosis; neurology; spinal adjustment/manipulation, a nd other topics, as we ll as a review of course materials of chiropractic colle ges where toxicology or pharmacology were mentioned. The applicant also took issue with the refere nce to chiropractors not having prescriptive authority within the report, st ating that these examinations don't require prescribing, nor medical interventions. Department Response Pharmacology training: The department acknowledges inconsistencies in where we referenced chiropractic traini ng in pharmacology. We have corrected any statement that indicates chiropractors have no pharmacology tr aining. We did not intend to infer there is't training in this area, onl y that there are varying levels of education in pharmacology, based on when and where a chiropractor gradua ted. The applicant references in rebuttal comments a CCE Accreditation Standard requirement for a toxicology component. Toxicology and pharmacology are not the same , with toxicology d ealing with poisons and their effect; and pharmacology dealing with drug origins, composition, use, and reactions. 27 Prescriptive authority: We acknowledge that PPEs and CMV examinations don't specifically require prescribing medications. Our intent was to show that because chiropractors don't have prescribing rights, most schools provide only minimum training in pharmacology. 28 We have clarified this in the repor t. In addition, lack of prescriptive authority becomes an issue if the PPE is a child's only annual examination because vaccinations are a safe and effective way to keep children from getting 14 serious and sometimes deadly diseases. 5. Multiple Subjects: The applicant's rebuttal number five had many different components so we are addressing those in pieces. A. Performing physicals is outside the chiropractic scope of practice: The applicant indicated disagreement with the department 's assessment that performing physicals is outside the chiropractic scope of practi ce for the reasons summarized below: The department has alleged chiropractor s aren't qualified to perform physicals that would identify both chiropractic and non-chiropractic-related medical conditions. \"An exam is an exam.\" 27 Taken from Merriam-Webster definitions 28 A 2010 press release from National University of Health Sciences stated it has determined that chiropractic physicians would need 90 hours of pharmacology to be able to prescribe safely from a limited formulary. It states that it offers chiropractic students 90 hours. <http://www.nuhs.edu/news/2010/8/nuh s-prepares-dcs-for-limited- prescription-powers-in-nm/> Chiropractic Sunrise Page 25 Because chiropractors are required to pe rform physical examinations within the chiropractic differential diagnosis, PPEs and CMV exams are also within their scope of practice. The applican t points to the CCE standards included with the applicant report materials as evidence supporting this claim, which the applicant feels the department has ignored. The department's assessment in the report that chiropracto rs cannot perform physicals for purposes other than chiropractic care is also incorrect. It provided the commission's interpre tive statement CH-12-13-12 to the department as evidence of this. Department Response The department disagrees with these assertions. The current scope of practice in law limits chiropractors to performing physical examinations to determine the appropriateness of chiropractic care or th e need for referral to other health care providers, not to do an overall health a ssessment of an individual. Interpretive statement CH-12-13-12 discusses independent chiropractic examinations at the request of a third party and doesn't support the app licant's claim. It states that if a chiropractor provides diagnosis or analysis but stops short of providing care or treatment, the activities are still considered the practice of chiropractic. For instance, if a chiropractor only revi ews a patient's file without a physical examination of the patient, that patient review is still co nsidered the practice of chiropractic. B. Chiropractic Education: The applicant stated evidence has already been provided to show that chiropractors are trained to perform these physic al exams, including a letter from the University of Western States on the curriculum, but th e department ignored this training and subjected chir opractors to a double standard. Department Response The department disagrees with this assessment. We reviewed all of the documents the applicant provided and have respon ded to the educational questions. C. Heart Conditions Undetected by Physicians: The applicant stated that the department acknowledged the existence of heart attacks following USDOT physicals and sudden cardiac death events in athlet es who have undergone PPEs as a concern, but didn't attribute these events as occu rring in \"the medical community's watch.\" Department Response The department has acknowledged these events occur in PPEs already being conducted (on page 14 under Background on PPEs and on page 17 under Definition of the Problem and Why Regulation is Nece ssary). In response to the applicant's concern, we added more specific language on page 17 that discu sses heart conditions undetected by physicians. D. Document Reference: The department had referenced a document on the WSCA's website in a statement about a chiropractor 's training being intended for recognizing conditions outside the scope of chiropractic fo r referral to other health care providers. The applicant stated information from the University of Western States was provided that we should have reviewed, rather th an choosing a state as sociation document. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 26 Department Response We reviewed all of the materials provided from the applicant on the University of Western States curriculum. Our choice to reference the WSCA document wasn't intended to replace the school curriculum but an attempt to capture a middle ground between the varying educational programs. After further review, we have removed the statement entirely. E. Diplomate American Chiropractic of Sports Physicians Training: The applicant took issue with the statement that only four percent of the examination is focused on the PPE. Department Response That wasn't the exact contex t of the statement; however, the department has removed this statement because we have attempted to clarify our position related to this sports medicine certification that isn't based solely on the examination components. 6. PPEs are not screening exams: The applicant argues that the department is incorrect in stating that PPEs aren't merely screenings, but are intended to be comprehensive physical evaluations. Department Response The department firmly believes that PPE and CMV exams both require comprehensive physical examinations to determine whether an individual can safely pa rticipate in sports or drive commercial vehicles. In order to conduct thorough examina tions, the providers performing these physicals should be qualified to make subjective decisions on conditions that may disqualify individuals with conditions like diabetes or asthma from safely participating in sports or driving commercial vehicles . These providers must also be able to assess and discuss side effects and interactions of prescription medications. The instructions for performing CMV exams in CFR 391.43 state \"The purpose of this history and physical examination is to detect the presence of physical, mental, or organic conditions of such a character and extent as to affect the driver's ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle safely. The exam ination should be conducted carefully...\" (emphasis added). Review of the Proposal Using Sunrise Criteria The applicant also had issues with how the depa rtment addressed the sunrise criteria in the report. The main points included: First Criterion - The applicant disagreed with the department's statement \"allowing providers with less training to perform PPEs won't alleviate the issue\" of highly- trained providers currently conducting PPEs missing warning signs of heart conditions. The applicant stated this is penalizing the chiropractic profession and limiting patient access, and is not appropriate. Department Response We don't feel this is penalizing the chir opractic profession. In reviewing scope of practice expansions, the department must look at whether the proposal ensures adequate training, which we feel the current proposal s under review don't contain. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 27 The fact that another profession does or doesn't perform PPEs adequately isn't relevant to the review. Second Criterion - The applicant stated that this criterion requires the scope of practice language to be changed in order to avoid lack of clarity, but \"is clearly not a reason to recommend chiropractors that should not perform these exams.\" The applicant also stated the department disregarded the information provided on education and training that qualifies chiropr actors to be authorized to perform CMV physicals, as well as the decisi on of the federal government. Department Response We clearly stated that changes to the definitions in RCW 18.25.005 must occur in order to accomplish an increase in the scope of practice for chiropractors. The department disagrees that we disregarded the information provided on chiropractic education and the decision of the federal government. Third Criterion - The applicant stated this criterion has already been met because chiropractors are already regulated. Department Response The department disagrees with this statem ent because public protection is in place with the current scope of practice, but the sunrise pr oposals don't contain similar assurances. References - The applicant referenced material s provided with the original sunrise application as well as follo w-up after the hearing about American Heart Association guidelines for use in PPEs. The materials discussed lack of compliance with the guidelines by providers doing PPEs. Department Response The department acknowledged this lack of co mpliance with appropria te guidelines in the report, as well as other issues identified with the way PPEs are currently being conducted. We saw these as issues to be addressed, but not w ith this proposal. Dr. Lorri Nichols, DC, CCEP 1. Use of \"may\" regarding conducting physicals - Dr. Nichols addressed the incorrect use of \"may\" in relation to conducti ng physical examinations and stated that the department made a significant error that she feels represents a bias about chiropractic education, training and daily practice. She further stated this demonstrates that the department is under an unfortunate and incorrect opinion th at HB 1573 would be an expansion rather than what she states is really a clarification of the scope of practice. She also added that the information the applicant presented shows chiropractors have adequate education and training, including the Diplomate American Chiropractic of Sports Physician and CCSP specialties. Chiropractic Sunrise Page 28 Department Response We addressed this issue in our response to Ms. Grassi's rebuttals above, acknowledging the unintentional error and amending it in th e report. We disagr ee that this is a clarification for reasons stat ed in our responses to Ms. Grassi's rebuttal statements. 2. Screenings or Physicals - Dr. Nichols also disagreed w ith the department's assessment that these examinations are intended to be comprehensive physical examinations. She reiterated Ms. Grassi's argument that doc tors who perform these examinations don't prescribe medications. Department Response Please see responses to Ms. Gr assi's rebuttal comments above. Dr. Ben McCay, DC 1. Physical Examination - \"There is no RCW that says comprehensive physical exams are not part of the chiropractic scope of practi ce. The 'physical examination' I was taught in school is comprehensive.\" Department Response The department reiterates our position that the physical examinations required for PPEs and CMV exams aren't currently included in th e chiropractic scope of practice in statute. We have addressed the education an d training in our above responses. 2. Prescriptive Authority - Prescriptive authority isn't n ecessary to perform the PPE, only to treat a condition upon referral to an MD. Department Response The department addressed this issue in our responses above. 3. Diplomate American Chiropractic of Sports Physicians Certification - It is incorrect to state the Diplomate American Chiropractic of Sports Physicians certification focuses primarily on spine, extremities, etc. It is 25 percent emergency medicine, including showing proficiency as an emergency medical technician. Other parts include extensive training in the management of concussi on and keys to a pr oper cardiac exam. Department Response In reviewing the Diplomate American Chiropr actic of Sports Phys icians certification materials, the department is unconvinced that this training bridges the gap in education, especially considering the divergent range of education obtained by current licensees. 4. MDs Currently Performing PPEs - Dr. McCay states that many MDs doesn't have a \"daily practice that includes functions of primary care,\" providing examples such as orthopedists and many sports physicians who can perform PPEs. Department Response The department has acknowledged issues w ith the current performance of PPEs and continues to assert that the propos al doesn't address these problems. 5. No solid evidence the number of deaths in sports will increase if DCs were allowed to perform PPEs - He states that \"the number on e killer in sports (hypertrophic Chiropractic Sunrise Page 29 cardiomyopathy) is not tradi tionally detected through a r outine examination. Clues to HCM are only found in the patient history. Th erefore, there remains no solid evidence that the number of deaths in sport will increase if DCs were allowed to perform PPEs.\" Department Response The department doesn't allege to have evidence to this effect, only that there is a problem with the current process that th is proposal doesn't address. Washington East Asian Medicine Association The association requested a correction to a statem ent in the draft report that chiropractors are allowed to perform dry needling in Oregon. They stated this is no longer correct due to a judicial stay issued by the Oregon Court of A ppeals of the enabling administrative rule. Department Response The association is correct that dry needling by ch iropractors in Oregon is under judicial scrutiny. We have removed the reference to the use of dry needling in Oregon on page 13. Chiropractic Sunrise 30 Appendix A Applicant Report Chiropractic Sunrise 31 Chiropractic Sunrise 32Applicant Report Cover Sheet and Outline Washington State Department of Health Sunrise Review COVER SHEET Legislative proposa l being reviewe d under the sunrise process (include bill number if available): HB 1573- This legislation, as drafted, would include school districts in the description of \"political subdivisions\", and specifically identified the \"Washington Interscholastic Activities Association\" in the entities not allowed to discriminate in 18.25 RCW. The proposed legislation would also allow doctors of chiropractic to perfonn sports physicals for school athletes and physicals examinations for commercial truck drivers. The bill did not move from the House Health Care Committee therefore no amendments were able to be proposed however; we propose the following changes to the initial bill draft: 1. Remove reference to the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA); and 2. Apply the proposed legislation to all youth sports; and 3. Propose additional training requirements for those doctors of chiropractic who would be eligible to perfonn pre-participation physical examinations; and 4. Require Federal Motor Camer training for doctors of chiropractic perfonning the physical examinations that would meet the criteria of the Federal Motor Canier Safety Act.

Regulation assures that a minimum level of competency is obtained by aU providers perfomiing these examinations. The problem identified by the Washington State Chiropractic Association (WSCA) is the arbitraiy selection of which health care providers are identified to perform these examinations. Specifically, Doctors of Chiropractic are excluded from the privilege of perfomiing athletic pre-participation examinations (PPE) and Department of Transportation (DOT) examinations in Washington State. The regulation of DOT professional driver physical examinations are regulated nationally through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act (1992). The DOT classifies doctors of cliiropractic as health care 2 Chiropractic Sunrise 34providers pemiitted to perfonn DOT examinations. The Federal government requires all health care providers, regardless of their temiinal degree, to be certified and tested tlirough the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners and provides the necessaiy training. The WSCA requests that the federal DOT mles and regulations also be applied in the State of Wasliington. - - --- - Taken from the Federal Motor Canier Safety Act, Department of Transportation webshe, frequently asked questions document: Q: JVlw can sen'e as a Medical Examiner and perform DOT Physical Exams? A: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Reguladons define Medical Examiner as a person who is licensed, certified and/or registered in accordance with applicable State laws and regulations to perform physical examinations. The term includes but is not limited to doctors of medicine, doctors of osteopathy, physician assistants, advanced practice nurses and doctors of chiropractic. There are no federal guidelines regarding PPE examinations. States decide on an individual basis who may provide a PPE. Almost half of the states authorize doctors of cliiropractic to perfomi PPE, one State (Colorado) provides for additional certification for interested doctors of chiropractic to become listed on a registry to perfomi the PPE. Attachments D and E reference application of PPE's in other states. The WSCA seeks consistency in the scopes of practice in Wasliington State as compared to others including the Federal Govenmieiit and States wliich provide for doctors of cliiropractic to perfonn PPEs. There is significant demand by the public for these sei-vices. The restrictions proliibiting interested chiropractic doctors from providing the care to their patients in a cost effective manner creates delays in health care senices and additional expenses for patients because of the shortage of primary care physicians. Additionally, patients have existing and established relationships with their chiropractic doctors. These patient health care provider relationships should not be mmecessary limited in regards to providing cost efficiencies, timeliness and continuity of appropriate heahh care services. (a) The nature of the potentia l harm to the public if the health professio n is not regulated , and the extent to which there is a threat to public health and safety. There is minimal to no additional risk to the public because doctors of chiropractic are regulated by the State of Washington under RCW 18.25.005 and these cluiicians provide an important role in heahh care in the State of Washington. The current regulatory scope of practice does not reflect recent advances m the education of the cliiropractic profession including specialty and recent trends m voluntary training to demonstrate additional competencies. Tliis proposal recognizes doctors of cliiropractic with specialty training or addhional voluntaiy training specific to these areas of practice provide an important quality assurance measure. This proposal will protect public heahh and safety tlirough education and training. (b) The extent to which consumer s need and will benefit from a method of regulatio n identifyin g competent practitioners , indicatin g typical employers , if any, of practitioner s in the health profession. Consumers will benefit by greater access to qualified health care providers with specialized training in the pre-participation examination and federal recognition to perfonn DOT examinations. Special certification in the PPE is unique to the chiropractic profession as tliis gi\"oup of health care providers meets inclusion tln'ough voluntary processes to ensure clinical competencies. The WSCA recognizes the variability of clinical expertise on all health care provider groups. To protect the 3 Chiropractic Sunrise 35citizens of Wasliington the WSCA promotes additional training and measurements of competency for those doctors of chiropractic who are interested in providing additional semces to their patients. The voluntaiy participation and identification of doctors of chiropractic with special training, as recognized by state or federal regulatoiy bodies, provides for a measure of quality assurance to consumers that meets or exceeds other health care provider groups. (c) The extent of autonom y a practitione r has, as indicated by: (i) The extent to which the health profession calls for independen t judgmen t and the extent of skill or experienc e required in making the independen t judgment ; and (ii) The extent to which practitioner s are supervised : Proposed updates to the scope of practice will benefit the public by proving a mechanism whereby the pubhc can be assured that participating licensed doctors of chiropractic who provide DOT or/and PPE examinations meet and maintain additional training in regards to the new sendees they provide. This proposal defines the level of education required to maintain such training. (2) The efforts made to address the problem : (a) Voluntar y efforts, if any, by member s of the health professio n to: (i) Establis h a code of ethics; or (ii) Help resolve disputes between health practitioners and consumers ; and (b) Recours e to and the extent of use of applicabl e law and whether it could be strengthene d to control the problem : The proposed changes to scope of practice would clarify cuiTent law under RCW 18.25.005 by further defining a subset of doctors of cliiropractic specially trained in sports medicine, the perfonnance of a PPE and DOT regulations. Cunent law allows for doctors of cliiropractic to perform a physical examination, however the PPE is not specifically addressed. The ability to perfonn the PPE which results in the clearance of atliletes to participate in organized sport should be witliin the scope of practice for trained heahh care providers including doctors of cliiropractic. Due to growth in the profession, there are gi-oups of doctors of chiropractic with special training in certain fields of health care. These fields of specialty training include sports medicine and the performance of DOT examinations. This proposal provides for special acknowledgement in the practice act to define these specially trained doctors of cliiropractic. There are no proposed changes to cunent law that would affect the current code of etliics of the profession nor changes to RCW 18.130 (Regulation of heahh professions \u2014 uiiifonii disciplinary act). (3) The alternative s considered : (a) Voluntar y efforts, if any, by member s of the health profession to: (a) Regulatio n of business employer s or practitioner s rather than employee practitioners; (b) Regulatio n of the program or ser^1ce rather than the individua l practitioners; (c) Registratio n of all practitioners ; (d) Certificatio n of all practitioners ; (e) Other alternatives ; (f) Why the use of the alternative s specified in this subsectio n would not be adequate to protect the public interest; and (g) Why licensing would serve to protect the public interest. Updating RCW 18.25.005 to the standards as proposed in (Attaclmient A) would sene the public interest by allowing specially trained doctors of chiropractic to perfonn sei-vices in high public demand. Additionally, tliis proposal sei-ves as a quality assurance measure by identifying a subgroup of the profession with special training and providing a portal for consumers to access a list of providers that hold State or Federal recognition to provide needed senices. 4 Chiropractic Sunrise 36There are no provisions in the proposed standards for senices to be perfomied by anyone other than individuals licensed in RCW 18.25.005. A certification requirement by endorsement to the chiropractor's license is the most effective way to manage the training and certification requirements have been met and that those perfonning these examinations are safe. Due to the autonomous nature of chiropractic practice endorsement by the Chiropractic Quality Assurance Commission is the most appropriate methodology. (4) The benefit to the pubhc if regulatio n is granted. Consumers will benefit from the updated standards now being proposed as these standards will allow the practitioner with special training to provide a broader range of semces within the cunent regulating guidelines for doctors of cliiropractic. Primary care medicine is an undersei^ved need in health care. PPEs and DOT examinations have traditionally been perfomied by primaiy care health care providers. Allowing for additional providers with special training to provide PPE/DOT examinations, consumers will benefit fi-om gi-eater access to care as well as the right to seek care from the health care providers they choose. The public will be assured of quality of care by the educational endorsement requirements described in this statute. Cunently the statute does not reflect the growth of the profession or allow for interested practitioners to fully utilize their specialized post-graduate training for the heahh and enriclmieiit of the public. Consumers seeking fitness for duty examinations by qualified Medical Examiners, as defined in the Federal Motor Canier Safety Act, will benefit by having gi-eater access to providers especially in mral areas of Washington State. Cunently there are only 24 total providers listed in the National Registiy available to perfonn Department of Transportation examinations for conmiercial drivers. (4)(a)The extent to which the incidenc e of specific problem s present in the unregulate d health profession can reasonabl y be expected to be reduced by regulation ; This proposal addresses only regulated heahh care providers. The educational and knowledge assessment procedures are designed to mitigate known concenis. Therefore, in order for doctors of chiropractic to be allowed to perfonn these examinations the scope of practice must be specifically defmed. (4)(b) Whether the public can identify qualified practitioners . The Department of Health (DOH) has an easily navigable and searchable Web-she that lists all practitioners by name and license number so the public can identify qualified doctors of clhropractic. All information regarding a chiropractor's current licensing status or issues involving licensure is clearly marked and for public record. TMs proposal requests that the DOH Chiropractic Quahty Assurance Commission add a section to this web site that clearly identifies doctors of chiropractic whh speciahy training in the PPE or that the Chiropractic Quahty Assurance Commission maintain a list of doctors of chiropractic who have received the endorsement following certification and testing. As an addhional resource the Washington State Chiropractic Association is able to maintain a list of providers available to consumers and the designation can be identified on hs webshe when searcMng for cliiropractic services. The doctors of chiropractic engaged in the Federal Motor Canier Safety fit for duty examinations will be identified tlu-ough the National Registiy of Certified Medical Examiners (National Registiy) is a new Federal Motor Carrier Safety Adniiiiistration (FMCSA) program. It requires all medical examiners (MEs) who wish to perform physical examinations for interstate commercial motor vehicle (CMV) 5 Chiropractic Sunrise 37drivers to be trained and certified in FMCSA pliysical qualification standards. Medical examiners who have completed the training and successfiilly passed the test are included in an online directory on the National Registry webshe. (4)(c) The extent to which the public can be confiden t that qualified practitioner s are competent. Based on the testimony of comments provided at the Febraaiy 21,2013, hearing in the House Heahh Care Coiimiittee for the proposed legislation, h is clear that the general public, especially our opposition, is unaware of the base chiropractic education. By statute, a chiropractic doctor must graduate from a Council on Cliiropractic Education (CCE) accredited college or university. CCE accredited institutions require the doctor of chiropractic programs to include traiiihig in physical diagnosis tlirough an absolute minimum of 4,200 instmctioiial hours, and include in and practice of chiropractic; clinical decision making; adjustive tecliniques; research methods and procedures; and professional practice ethics. The accreditation requirements for CCE can be found in the document titled \"Council on Chiropractic Education Standards for Doctor of Cliiropractic Programs and Requirements for histitutional Status\" A detailed outline of the curriculum pertaiiihig to the physical examination requirements are detailed in attachment F, pages 31-34. In addition, examinations for license to practice cliiropractic shall be developed and administered, or approved, or both, by the commission according to the method deemed by it to be the most practicable and expedhious to test the applicant's qualifications. The commission may approve an exaimnation prepared or administered by a private testing agency or association of licensing authorities, hi Waslmigton State the Cliiropractic Quality Assurance Commission uses the national examination for chiropractic wlhch is approved by the Council on Cliiropractic Education (CCE) and the examination for licensing is administered by National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE). Examination subjects may include the following: Aiatomy, physiology, spinal anatomy, nhcrobiology-public health, general diagnosis, neuromusculoskeletal diagnosis, X-ray, principles of chiropractic and adjusting, as taught by chiropractic schools and colleges, and any other subject areas consistent with chapter 18.25 RCW. The commission shall set the standards for passing the examination. The commission may enact additional requirements for testing administered by the national board of chiropractic examiners. All examinations are managed by NBCE including Parts 1- FV wlhch includes the following: Parti Includes subject exanhnations in each of six basic science areas: general anatomy, spinal anatomy, physiology, chemistry, pathology, and microbiology. Each subject examination contains 110 standard multiple-choice questions and is allotted 90 minutes of testing time. 6 Chiropractic Sunrise 38Part II Consists of 110 multiple-choice questions in each of six clinical science areas, including general diagnosis, neuromusculoskeletal diagnosis, diagnostic imaging, principles of cliiropractic, chiropractic practice, and associated clinical sciences. Each Part II subject is ahotted 90 minutes of testing time, with a 20-niinute break between subjects. Part III Addresses nine clinical areas: case history, physical examination, neuromusculoskeletal examination, diagnostic imaging, clinical laboratory and special studies, diagnosis or clinical impression, cliiropractic teclmiques, supportive inten'entions, and case management. The Part III Examination consists of two books, whh a total of 110 standard multiple-choice questions and 10 case vignettes, broken down as follows: Each book has 55 standard multiple-choice questions, plus five case vignettes Each of the five case vignettes contains tlu-ee extended multiple-choice questions Each extended multiple-choice question requires tliree answers Each book is allotted two hours of testing time. Part IV The NBCE Part FV Examination tests individuals in tliree major areas: x-ray interpretation and diagnosis chiropractic teclmique case management Resuhs of the Part IV Examination may be used by state licensing authorities in lieu of other practical examinations for licensure. The NBCE Part FV Examination is administered in May and November of each year. hi Wasliington State the CQAC began using Part FV in May of 1999 to replace their x-ray practical examination but still requhed the Washington State generated clihopractic practical exam, hi 2000, Washington State began requiring Part FV for licensure without further state generated practical tests. Presently, Part FV is accepted in all licensing jurisdictions in the Umted States except for Ulinois, which has no requirement for a practical licensure examination. (4)(c)(i)Whether the propose d regulator y entit>' would be a board compose d of member s of the profession and public members , or a state agency, or both, and, if appropriate , their respectiv e responsibilities in administerin g the system of registration , certification , or licensure , includin g the compositio n of the board and the number of public members , if any; the powers and duties of the board or state agency regardin g examination s and for cause revocation , suspension , and nonrenewal of registrations , certificates , or Ucenses; the promulgatio n of rules and canons of ethics; the conduct of inspections ; the receipt of complaint s and disciplinar y action taken against practitioners; and how fees would be levied and collected to cover the expenses of administerin g and operatin g the regulator y system. Chiropractic Sunrise 39The regulatory entity for the chiropractic profession in Washington State is in place and there are no additional boards needed if this proposal is implemented. The cuirent Chiropractic Quality Assurance Conmiission is already established and receives complaints and manages disciplinaiy action on ah cliiropractic matters. (4)(c)(ii) If there is a grandfathe r clause, whether such practitioner s will be required to meet the prerequisite qualification s establishe d by the regulator y entity at a later date. No grandfather clause is proposed for the PPE, all doctors participating would be required to meet the PPE examination. The DOT provides for the measurement of competency in regards to the DOT examination. Individuals meeting the federal requh-eiiieiits should be pemiitted to provide the DOT physical examination service. (4)(c)(iii) The nature of the standard s proposed for registration , certification , or hcensure as compared with the standard s of other jurisdictions . Currently more than 15 states have special regulations regardmg the PPE in theh chiropractic practice acts. One state, Colorado, currently requires special certification as proposed in this document. A sunmiaiy of these regulations is enclosed in appendix E. The Federal govenmient requires all health care providers, regardless of their tenninal degree, to be certified and tested tluough the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners and provides the necessary training. The WSCA requests that the federal DOT mles and regulations also be applied in the State of Washington. The Guidance for the Core Cuniculum Specifications is provided as Attacliment G, and the Complete Guide to Medical Examiner Certification is provided as Attaclmient H. All providers must achieve certification to qualify as a DOT Medical Examiner. (4)(c)(iv) Whether the regulator y entity would be authorize d to enter into reciprocit y agreements with other jurisdictions . Tlhs is not applicable to a profession regulated under the Secretary of Heahh. (4)(c)(v) The nature and duration of any training including , but not limited to, whether the training includes a substantia l amount of super^1se d field experience ; whether training program s exist in this state; if there will be an experienc e requirement ; whether the experienc e must be acquired under a registered , certificated , or licensed pracfitioner ; whether there are alternafiv e routes of entry or methods of meeting the prerequisit e qualifications ; whether all apphcant s will be required to pass an examination ; and, if an examinatio n is required , by whom it will be developed and how the costs of developmen t will be met. The educational coursework and competency testing would be offered at least once annually. There are two tracks available to Doctors of Chiropractic to become registered to perfomi the PPE: 1. A 18 hour course that prepares the Doctor of Chiropractic to perfomi the pre-participation examination and make clearance decisions to participate in sport. The course syllabus is attached in Appendix B. The preparatory PPE course is a 12 hour didactic course that delivers specific PPE education tlu-ough either live or distance based education accompanied 8 Chiropractic Sunrise 40by a minimum of six additional hours of practical education. The education syllabus would be approved by the Washington Quality Assurance Commission. AND An outcome evaluation that measures the learner's competency would be provided. A minimum passing score of 80% or better on a written/practical examination. CuiTent board certification by the American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians as a Diplomate of the American Chiropractic of Sports Physicians (DACBSP) would be eligible to challenge the PPE written examination because of their prior training and education in regards to this topic. The educational requirements for the DACBSP are attached in Attacliment C. No additional supervised field experience is required as part of tliis training program. All doctors would be required to demonstrate certification in CPR. CPR training will be obtained outside the PPE course and minimally meet the CPR and AED for the professional rescuer. To ensure continued competence and knowledge of best practices in perfomiing PPEs, all participating doctors will need to recertify every two (2) years tlu-ough additional training coursework consisting of four hours followed by an additional competency evaluation. The recertification examination will focus on core learning objectives as well as new infonnation regarding PPEs. Leamer outcome examinations will be considered successful with an 80% examination score. The recertified doctor's names would then be updated on the PPE DC Registry. All course content and examinations would be created by Doctors of Chiropractic holding the highest board certification in sports medicine (Diplomate of the American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians) and the clinical expertise in the area of the PPE. Training and examination development costs would be paid for the Washington State Chiropractic Association. There are existing training programs for the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners to provide the prerequisite education. The DOT provides for the examination and maintenance of the DOT related recognition. (4)(c)(vi) What additiona l training program s are anticipate d to be necessar y to assure training accessible statewide ; the anticipate d time required to establish the additiona l training programs ; the types of institution s capable of providin g the training ; a descriptio n of how training programs will meet the needs of the expected work force, includin g reentry workers , minorities , placebound students , and others. As described in (4)(c)(v) additional training for the DOT pathway is already in place and for the PPE additional training in the form of live or distance based education would be required. All training courses would be approved by the Washington State Chiropractic Quality Assurance Coimnission, 9 Chiropractic Sunrise 41be affiUated with CCE approved educational institutions, and instmctors would be required to hold an advanced certification in sports medicine (DACBSP required) as well as a minimum of 5 years of experience in the perfonnance and analysis of the PPE. histitutions providing training must include distance based platfomis for training in order to reduce educational costs associated with travel. (4)(d) Assuranc e of the public that practitioner s have maintaine d their competence . Assurance of practitioner competence is achieved tlu-ough the public's ability to freely access licensing and PPE certification infonnation tlu-ough the Department of Health Web she or by contacting the Department of Heahh directly. The list of active certificate holders wih provide the public with a list of doctors of chiropractic who have been found to be competent in the PPE by written examination within the previous 2 years. The Federal govermnent requires all health care providers, regardless of their tenninal degree, to be certified and tested tlirough the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners and provides the iiecessai-y training. (4)(d)(i) Whether the registration , certification , or hcensure will carry an expiratio n date. The cunent PPE proposal includes an expiration date of 2 years from certification. Renewal will be allowed by challenge examination for those already certified. The Federal govermnent manages the National Registi-y of Certified Medical Examiners. (4) (d)(ii) Whether renewal will be based only upon payment of a fee, or whether renewal will involve reexamination , peer re^dew, or other enforcement . Renewal will be based on the ability to pass a written examination. A smah fee for administration expense related to PPE test and database administration will be required as part of the renewal process. The Federal govenmient manages the related fees for the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners. (5) The extent to which regulatio n might harm the public. The regulation will provide quality assurance to the public and reduce risk of harm. The proposed regulations improve quahty of care by identifying specially trained providers for a sei-vice that is in high demand in the State of Washington. Tins PPE proposal exceeds requirements of other professions cunently providing PPE examinations. (5)(a) The extent to which regulatio n will restrict entry into the health profession : (i) Whether the proposed standard s are more restrictiv e than necessar y to insure safe and effective performance. The proposed standards do not restrict eiitiy based on existing or new licensing requirements; there are no proposed changes to existing licensing requirements. The proposed standards are not more restrictive than necessary as they do not require mandatory use of the tecliniques by practitioners nor apphcation to every patient. (5)(a)(ii) Whether the propose d legislatio n requires registered , certificated , or licensed practitioners in other jurisdiction s who migrate to this state to qualify in the same manner as state applicant s for registration , certification , and hcensure when the other jurisdictio n has 10 Chiropractic Sunrise 42substantially equivalen t requirement s for registration , certification , or licensur e as those in this state. Alternative or equivalent certification programs or education requirements are not accepted. (5) (b) Whethe r there are similar profession s to that of the applican t group which should be included in, or portion s of the applican t group which should be exclude d from, the propose d legislation. Tills regulation is not relevant to any other groups or subgi-oups.

METHODS: Addresses for both the state chiropractic boards (SBCs) and the state athletic associations (AAs) were located via the internet. A letter was generated and emailed to each stale. 'ITic wording in the letters going to the state boards of chiropractic and athletic associations were altered appropriately. Return receipts were requested. If no answer was received within 2 weeks, a second request was sent. If two more weeks went by without a response, a phone call was placed to the individual. Results were then tallied into an Excel spreadsheet, including specific comments. Responses were received form all states. RESULTS: 70% (35) of the chiropractic boards have policies allowing PPEs by DCs; 26% (13) have no policy; and 4% (2) specifically deny DCs to perform PPEs. 36% (18) AAs have policies allowing PPEs by DCs; 14% (7) leave the decision up to the local school boards; 42% (21) AAs specifically deny DCs; 4% (2) AAs have no policy; and 4% (2) have policies that require legal interpretation. Colorado uniquely requires the chiropractor to be \"school physical certified\". Oregon and Washington expressed concerns about the chiropractor's ability to detect cardiac pathologies. Washington has handled this by allowing chiropractors only to perform PPEs as part of a team. Rhode Island and Vermont have no PPE policy. Nevada declares the issue is under review. New Hampshire and Nebraska have policies subject to interpretation. The reason for some of the athletic associations refiising DC-performed PPEs is the issue regarding the DCs ability to detect cardio pathology/cardio-monitoring. They believe chiropractors do not know how lo do this, or do not do it with enough regularity. CONCLUSION: The ability for DCs to perform pre-participation examinations (PPEs) is determined by the policies of three entities: state Board of Chiropractic Examiners (BCE), state high school athletic associations (AA), and, at times, the local school board. There is inconsistency between the BCEs and the AAs, as a majority of BCEs permit chiropractic- performed PPEs, but only a fi-action of state AAs allow them. Most state boards of chiropractic have a specific policy regarding PPEs. Those state boards allowing chiropractors to do PPEs consider it \"within the scope of practice\" based on the fact that physical examinations were taught in chiropractic college. While a chiropractic board will permit a PPE to be performed by a chiropractor, it may not always be accepted by the school requesting the exam. The state's school athletic associations can override the state board decisions. Unfortunately there is not always consistency between the two.

The final mle states that a medical examiner must complete a training program. FMCSA explained in the preamble to the final mle that training providers and organizations must follow the core cuniculum specifications in developing training programs for medical examiners who apply for listing on the Agency's National Registiy. This training prepares medical examiners to: Apply knowledge of FMCSA's driver physical qualifications standards and advisoiy criteria to findings gathered during the driver's medical examination; and Make sound detemiinations of the driver's medical and physical qualifications for safely operating a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) in interstate commerce. The mle, 49 CFR 390.105(b), lists eight topics which must be covered in the core curriculum specifications.

Chiropractic Sunrise 93Pre-Participation Physical Examinations The pre-participation physical examination (PPE) is an important step toward safe participation in organized sports. The purpose of the PPE is not to disqualify or exclude an athlete from competition, but rather to help maintain the health and safety of the athlete in training andcompetition. The pre-participation physical examination (PPE) has the following goals: Identify medical and orthopedic problems that may place the athlete at risk forinjury or illness; Identify correctable problems that may impair the athlete's ability to perform; Maintain the health and safety of the athlete; Assess fitness level for specific sports; Educate athletes and parents concerning sports, exercise, injuries and other healthrelated issues; and Meet legal and insurance requirements. The PPE is generally a formal requirement prior to participation in junior high, highschool, college or professional sports, andinterim exams are done annually ifrequired or indicated. The qualifications of the health care professionals who perform the PPE are based on practitioneravailability, clinical expertise and individual state laws. The PPE is best done in amedical setting to ensure properequipment and appropriate privacy;however, the large number of athletesinvolved, limited time for the exam anddeadlines for participation often require the PPE to be done in a format of multiple\"stations,\" with several health careproviders each focusing on their areas ofexpertise. The PPE comprises severalparts: past medical history, sport-specifichistory, family history and physical exam.A COMPLETE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAM A well-rounded physical activity program includesaerobic exercise and strength training exercise, butnot necessarily in the same session. This blend helpsmaintain or improve cardiorespiratory and muscularfitness and overall health and function. Regularphysical activity will provide more health benefits thansporadic, high intensity workouts, so chooseexercises you are likely to enjoy and that you canincorporate into your schedule. ACSM's physical activity recommendations for healthy adults, updated in 2011, recommend at least 30minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity(working hard enough to break a sweat, but still ableto carry on a conversation) five days per week, or 20minutes of more vigorous activity three days per week. Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet thisrecommendation. Examples of typical aerobic exercises are: Walking Running Stair climbing Cycling Rowing Cross country skiing Swimming. In addition, strength training should be performed a minimum of two days each week, with 8-12 repetitions of 8-10 different exercises that target all major muscle groups. This type of training can beaccomplished using body weight, resistance bands, free weights, medicine balls or weight machines. ACSM Information On...

After a thorough history and physicalexam, the health care provider will make aparticipation decision by answering thefollowing questions: Is there a problem that places the athlete at increased risk of injury? Is any other participant at risk of injury because of this problem? Can the athlete safely participate with treatment of the problem? Can limited participation be allowed while treatment is indicated? If clearance is denied for certain activities, in what activities can theysafely participate? Is consultation with another healthcare provider necessary to answer the abovequestion? Restriction from participation must bemade based upon the best medicallyobjective evidence on an individual basis,and it is determined with themusculoskeletal, cardiac and aerobicdemands of the proposed activity in mind.If clearance is denied, recommendationsfor correction prior to participation shouldbe communicated and a follow-upevaluation should be scheduled. If acuteillnesses or correctable conditions areresolved, clearance should be given.Although the PPE may identify healthproblems or needs not associated withexercise, it should not be used to replace ongoing medical care or routine check-ups with primary care physicians.STAYING ACTIVE PAYS OFF! Those who are physically active tend to live longer,healthier lives. Research shows that moderatephysical activity - such as 30 minutes a day of briskwalking - significantly contributes to longevity. Even aperson with risk factors like high blood pressure,diabetes or even a smoking habit can gain realbenefits from incorporating regular physical activityinto their daily life. As many dieters have found, exercise can help you stay on a diet and lose weight. What's more - regularexercise can help lower blood pressure, control bloodsugar, improve cholesterol levels and build stronger,denser bones. THE FIRST STEP Before you begin an exercise program, take a fitnesstest, or substantially increase your level of activity,make sure to answer the following questions. Thisphysical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) willhelp determine if you're ready to begin an exerciseroutine or program. Has your doctor ever said that you have a heart condition or that you should participate in physicalactivity only as recommended by a doctor? Do you feel pain in your chest during physical activity? In the past month, have you had chest pain when you were not doing physical activity? Do you lose your balance from dizziness? Do you ever lose consciousness? Do you have a bone or joint problem that could be made worse by a change in your physical activity? Is your doctor currently prescribing drugs for your blood pressure or a heart condition? Do you know of any reason you should not participate in physical activity? If you answered yes to one or more questions, if youare over 40 years of age and have recently beeninactive, or if you are concerned about your health,consult a physician before taking a fitness test orsubstantially increasing your physical activity. If youanswered no to each question, then it's likely that youcan safely begin exercising. PRIOR TO EXERCISE Prior to beginning any exercise program, including theactivities depicted in this brochure, individuals shouldseek medical evaluation and clearance to engage inactivity. Not all exercise programs are suitable foreveryone, and some programs may result in injury.Activities should be carried out at a pace that iscomfortable for the user.

Chiropractic Sunrise 101ACGME Program Requirements for Graduate Medical Education in Sports Medicine One-year Common Program Requirements are in BOLD Effective: July 1, 2011 Introduction Int.A. Residency and fellowship programs are essential dimensions of the transformation of the medical student to the independent practitioner along the continuum of medical education. They are physically, emotionally, and intellectually demanding, and require longitudinally-concentrated effort on the part of the resident or fellow. The specialty education of physicians to practice independently is experiential, and necessarily occurs within the context of the health care delivery system. Developing the skills, knowledge, and attitudes leading to proficiency in all the domains of clinical competency requires the resident and fellow physician to assume personal responsibility for the care of individual patients. For the resident and fellow, the essential learning activity is interaction with patients under the guidance and supervision of faculty members who give value, context, and meaning to those interactions. As residents and fellows gain experience and demonstrate growth in their ability to care for patients, they assume roles that permit them to exercise those skills with greater independence. This concept\u2014 graded and progressive responsibility\u2014is one of the core tenets of American graduate medical education. Supervision in the setting of graduate medical education has the goals of assuring the provision of safe and effective care to the individual patient; assuring each resident's and fellow's development of the skills, knowledge, and attitudes required to enter the unsupervised practice of medicine; and establishing a foundation for continued professional growth.

Maximum Duty Period Length Duty periods of fellows may be scheduled to a maximum of 24 hours of continuous duty in the hospital. Programs must encourage fellows to use alertness management strategies in the context of patient care responsibilities. Strategic napping, especially after 16 hours of continuous duty and between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., is strongly suggested. VI.G.4.a) It is essential for patient safety and fellow education that effective transitions in care occur. Fellows may be allowed to remain on-site in order to accomplish these tasks; however, this period of time must be no longer than an additional four hours. VI.G.4.b) Fellows must not be assigned additional clinical responsibilities after 24 hours of continuous in-house duty. VI.G.4.c) In unusual circumstances, fellows, on their own initiative, may remain beyond their scheduled period of duty to continue to provide care to a single patient. Justifications for such extensions of duty are limited to reasons of required continuity for a severely ill or unstable patient, academic importance of the events transpiring, or humanistic attention Chiropractic Sunrise 118Sports Medicine 18 to the needs of a patient or family. VI.G.4.c).(1) Under those circumstances, the fellow must: VI.G.4.c).(1).(a) appropriately hand over the care of all other patients to the team responsible for their continuing care; and, VI.G.4.c).(1).(b) document the reasons for remaining to care for the patient in question and submit that documentation in every circumstance to the program director. VI.G.4.c).(2) The program director must review each submission of additional service, and track both individual fellow and program-wide episodes of additional duty. VI.G.5. Minimum Time Off between Scheduled Duty Periods VI.G.5.a) Fellows must be prepared to enter the unsupervised practice of medicine and care for patients over irregular or extended periods. Sports medicine fellows are considered to be in the final years of education. VI.G.5.a).(1) This preparation must occur within the context of the 80-hour, maximum duty period length, and one-day-off-in-seven standards. While it is desirable that fellows have eight hours free of duty between scheduled duty periods, there may be circumstances when these fellows must stay on duty to care for their patients or return to the hospital with fewer than eight hours free of duty. VI.G.5.a).(1).(a) Circumstances of return-to-hospital activities with fewer than eight hours away from the hospital by fellows must be monitored by the program director. VI.G.5.a).(1).(b) The Review Committee defines such circumstances as: required continuity of care for a severely ill or unstable patient, or a complex patient with whom the resident has been involved; events of exceptional educational value; or, humanistic attention to the needs of a patient or family. VI.G.6. Maximum Frequency of In-House Night Float Fellows must not be scheduled for more than six consecutive nights of night float. Chiropractic Sunrise 119Sports Medicine 19 VI.G.7. Maximum In-House On-Call Frequency Fellows must be scheduled for in-house call no more frequently than every-third-night (when averaged over a four-week period). VI.G.8. At-Home Call VI.G.8.a) Time spent in the hospital by fellows on at-home call must count towards the 80-hour maximum weekly hour limit. The frequency of at-home call is not subject to the every-third-night limitation, but must satisfy the requirement for one-day-in-seven free of duty, when averaged over four weeks. VI.G.8.a).(1) At-home call must not be so frequent or taxing as to preclude rest or reasonable personal time for each fellow. VI.G.8.b) Fellows are permitted to return to the hospital while on at- home call to care for new or established patients. Each episode of this type of care, while it must be included in the 80-hour weekly maximum, will not initiate a new \"off-duty period\". *** ACGME Approved: June 17, 2010 Effective: July 1, 2011 Minor Revision Approved: June 11, 2011 Effective: July 1, 2011 Revised Common Program Requirements Effective: July 1, 2011 Chiropractic Sunrise 120 Appendix D Public Hearing Transcript Chiropractic Sunrise 121 Chiropractic Sunrise 122Chiropractic Scope of Practice Sunrise Public Hearing Transcript August 6, 2013 Kristi Weeks, Director of Legal Services and Legi slative Liaison at the Department of Health, opened the hearing and introduced staff. She also introduced the hearing panel, who are there to make sure we have all the information we need to make a sound recommendation. Mike Weisman is a staff attorney in the Health Systems Quality Assurance Division. Shannon Walker is a supervisor in our Investigation and Inspections Office of the Health Systems Quality Assurance Division. Vicki Bouvier is the rules coordinator in our Environment Public Health Division. KRISTI WEEKS: Today's hearing is for the proponents to make their presentation, and for opponents and other interested parties to comment on the proposal. Panel members and department staff will ask questions during the proponents' presentation and public testimony. After the hearing, there will be a 10-day written comment period before we draft the initial report. We want to allow you to provide additional information on topics brought up today, and allow those who could not attend the hearing to submit information. The address for submitting comments is posted on the wall. The recommendations in our report will be based in part on this hearing. We expect the report to go to the Secretary of Health for approval in October. We ask that you stay after your presentation or testimony if possible, because there may be follow-up questions. You must sign in by 10:00 am to assure we have time for you to speak today. Please be sure you have signed up on the sign-in sheet if you wish to testify. We also use the contact information on this sheet for updating participants during the remainder of the process. Please keep two things in mind during your presentations and written submissions. First, we are reviewing the language sent to us by the legislature, which was House Bill 1573 from the 2013 legislative session. The statutes guiding the review process say that we will review what the legislature asked us to review and nothing else. Second, the sunrise review process has statutorily mandated criteria. We try to stick to those criteria as much as possible. As this is not a legislative hearing, political arguments or other factors not included in the criteria the legislature has given us will not help or hurt the proposal we are reviewing. It is the legislature's job to take those into account; they specifically have asked us to look only at certain criteria. It will be my job to try to keep us within the time limits as well as the limits of the review. The focus of our discussions should be the applicant's report and the proposed bill. We hold two or three or four of these hearings each year. Over time, we've been able to identify some strategies for holding a productive hearing: Please note this hearing is being recorded and your testimony will be shared with interested parties. Because it is important that the recording is clear so that future listeners can hear and understand it, we ask that you follow these two rules: Chiropractic Sunrise 1231. Please use the microphone when speaking. This includes panel members but not me; . 2. Please do not call out information from the audience. If you are the person at the podium, please do not solicit information from your colleagues in the audience. If there is a question that's been asked and the person who is asked the question does not have the information and you do, feel free to come up at some point and testify but please do not shout things out from the back. If your points have already been made by pr evious speakers, you do not need to repeat their testimony. Indicating your agreement wi th previous speakers will get your position on record. I would now like to welcome up the applicants to present their proposal to us. We ask that they please keep their presentation within the 30 minute limit we have provided so that we have time for panel questions and for others to testify. We will begin giving you verbal signals if you go beyond the time limit. Please use your time to focus on the sunrise criteria that are in law and how your proposal addresses those criteria. The panel members are invited to ask questions during this presentation which will be followed by public testimony. The panel members that I have listed are: Lori Grassi; Dr. Robert Nelson, and; Dr. Gary Schultz. LORI GRASSI: Good morning and thank you for your time today and for being here for this issue. For the record, I am Lori Grassi, Executive Director and lobbyist for the Washington State Chiropractic Association representing the chiropractic profession in Washington State. Throughout my many years with the WSCA we have addressed multiple venues making repeated efforts to clarify the ability for a chiropractor to perform pre-participation physical examinations for school aged athletes. There has been considerable conversation with former legislative bodies, meetings with the medical committee of the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA), the Department of Health Chiropractic Quality Assurance Commission (DOH-CQAC), the Washington State A ttorney General's office and the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). In general, each of these venues has delivered some minimal direction of where to take our case; all suggesting legislative clarity. When attempting to address the issue with other professionals, we are met with negative, visceral reaction and some consistent themes 1. A misunderstanding of the chiropractic education; 2. A lack of desire to learn the educational components, and 3. A long-standing bias against the chiropractic profession as a whole. The bias is so deep in some professions, and specifically in individuals, that in our February 2013, hearing, we were even accused of directing patients not to obtain immunizations even though a chiropractor wouldn't sign the waiver and is not allowed to sign the waiver established by the legislature anyway. Bias appears in many forms including test imony by other professions with less than half of the training of a chiropractic profession and they become disparaging and Chiropractic Sunrise 124accusatory. We hope that this venue will provide a more open environment to hear the true facts about the chiropractic education, their examinations and give us the clarity in our scope of practice that we have fought for for years and believe was intended when the current law was written. Because the WIAA provides recommendations and guidelines to school districts regarding high school PPE's, we initially perceived that they were the entity that our legislation be focused on. HB 1573 was drafted because the WSCA believed that the WIAA was violating antidiscrimination statutes (18.25.0192-18.25.0197) because of its relationship with the OSPI. After joint meetings with the current Superintendent and the WIAA, we began identifying the concerns that needed to be addressed. The WIAA felt that if the chiropractic scope more clearly stated that chiropractors could perform pre-parti cipation examinations, then they would modify their guidelines but it was their legal interpretation that the statute did not clearly allow for these exams and suggested we run legislation. Additional efforts within the Department of Health included an Assistant AG's opinion that a grammatical correction to the current scope be made that would allow chiropractors to perform these exams. At this recommendation, the WSCA felt it would be more appropriate and lead to greater clarity if the change to the scope was specific and direct in its language allowing for specific examinations to occur and to avoid future legal challenge on a statute that was changed only by grammar. The proposed legislation in 2013 was not amended prior to the deadline in legislative committee, which is why the title of the bill sent for Sunrise is different than the direction of the applicant report, yet we still feel there is a strong relationship. Amendments were drafted and had sponsors but since the policy cut-off occurred, there was no opportunity for amendments even though the legislators expected the change. Also, the prime sponsor of the Bill, Representative Harris, and the legislator referring the bill to sunrise, Representative Cody, agreed on the amendments but they were still not managed before the Session completed. To that end, we still believe our report addresses the intent of the bill. While the PPE challenges were occurring at the state level, a Federal ruling was made that chiropractors be allowed to perform Department of Transportation \"Fit for Duty\" examinations. The criteria for all provider categories performing these examinations is described and taught by DOT and includes MD's, DO's, PA's, DC's and ARNP's. As of August 5, 2013, there are only 25 providers of DOT exams in the entire state. Th is clearly identifies a shortage of providers to give these exams to drivers needing certification before going to work. Since the federal government has identified the provider types allowed to perform these exams and designates the exact same training be given to all of their medical examiners, chiropractors in Washington who prefer to specialize in this training s hould be allowed to perform these exams also. Clarification in the scope language will allow this to occur. This is not to state that all chiropractors will choose to perform either of these exams but they deserve the opportunity and patients deserve their choice of provider to deliver the service for those who do choose to specialize. Providers can choose to specialize in pediatrics, orthopedics or obstetrics but an obstetrician doesn't perform orthopedic surgery. In the same way that all medical doctors do not perform ever y type of service, a chiropractor who doesn't specialize in PPE and DOT examinations and thei r requirements, is not going to perform the PPE or DOT exams. There is no chiropractor in the state that would intentionally put their career, education and their lives on the line without the proper training to perform these services safely, and most importantly, effectively. As presented in our applicant report, many states allow chiropractors to perform PPE and DOT exams. In some of those states, no additional training is required and in some states there is Chiropractic Sunrise 125required training that follows a national model su ch as the Diplomate in American Chiropractic Sports Physicians (DACBSP), or the Certified Chiropractic Sports Physicians (CCSP) and in some states there is a specific training m odule written, which is what we have proposed modeling after the State of Colorado. There is a presumption that the chiropractor only performs services that are \"musculoskeletal\" in nature. While we believe they are the experts of these services, there is much more to chiropractic care than just musculoskeletal services or their training and education wouldn't require learning of all the systems of the body . Chiropractors have been \"boxed into\" a type of care by an insurance model which is unfair and part of what creates the bias against the profession. Like all other primary care providers, chiropractors must perform an examination on every patient, every visit, every time by statute (18.25.005 (3)). The specificity of a PPE or a DOT examination is an extension of this already required exam. With me today is Dr. Robert Nelson, of Colorado, who has been in practice for 27 years in Lakewood, Colorado, and holds certification as a Diplomate of American Chiropractic Sports Physician and was instrumental in implementin g the pre-participation examination requirements in the State of Colorado. I also have Dr. Gary Schultz, Vice President of Academic Affairs from the University of Western States in Portland, who will emphasize the chiropractic education and graduation examination requirements. Thank you for your time and I am available for questions. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Good Morning. My name is Dr. Robert Nelson. I am the chiropractor. I am the past president of the Colorado Chiropractic Association and the current president of the American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians. The ACBSP is the certifying body for all CCSPs and DACBSPs in the United States. I am the Colorado delegate to the American Chiropractic Association. I am board certified in sports medicine, DACSP. I am on the editorial review board for the Journal of Chiropractic M edicine. I also have an APC, advanced practice chiropractic certification, from the State of New Mexico. I'm licensed in Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Missouri and Illinois. I have several articles published in peer review journals and I have been the team chiropractor for the Pro Rodeo Cowboy Association and the team chiropractor for the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer. I also teach for five chiropractic colleges across the United States. I am here in support of the changes in the state of Washington, which will allow trained chiropractors to conduct pre-participation physicals and DOT examinations. I'd like to start by saying that when other professionals state that they feel chiropractors cannot conduct these examinations, I know that they are either uninformed or misinformed about our education and preparation to perform these examinations or, perhaps, there is a certain amount of bias in what they say. There are others here today who will speak to the educational process and standards but I will say that our schools are certified, not only by the Council on Chiropractic Education, but independent regional accreditation agencies as well. The same agency that accredits the University of Washington Medical School accredits the University of Western States in Portland, a chiropractic university. When I was going to school at Logan College of Chiropractic in St. Louis, Missouri, the regional accreditation agency that certified our courses also certified the Harvard Medical Sc hool and the University of Colorado Medical School. As part of my clinical rotations, I had to perform a certain number of complete physicals as part of the requirements for graduation. I performed pre- and post-fight physicals for the Chiropractic Sunrise 126Golden Glove Association of St. Louis. This included eye exams, hearing exams, heart evaluations, history, musculoskeletal, hernia examinat ions, just to list a few. Every patient who comes into my clinic has to be evaluated so that I can determine the differential diagnosis, everything from concussions to cardiac contusions. Is someone is in a car accident, do they have whiplash, do they have a disc, did they hit the steering wheel, what kind of problems do they have? Those evaluations, those perform ances, have to be done on every single patient every single time. We do these evaluations routinely. It's part of our practice; part of our law. First, I'd like to talk about the Department of Transportation fit for duty exams. The DOT has set up new guidelines for these examinations. The y have identified three types of physicians: MDs, DOs and DCs, as well as, nurse practitioners and PAs, as the ones who can do these examinations. Without regard to their degrees, all of these providers will have to undergo the same training and take the same test before they become certified examiners. The cutoff date is April, 2014. After that date, no one, but certified examiners, will be allowed to conduct these examinations. The American Chiropractic Association supports this regulation and the training required for all practitioners of any type who wish to become certified. To date, the largest group of certified examiners are chiropractors th anks, in part, to the educational tools provided by the ACA and other agencies. Now, I would like to address the PPEs for school physicals. I support trained chiropractors as having the right to perform school physicals. As Ms. Grassi stated, I have worked for many years implementing the pre-participation examinati on requirements in the state of Colorado. We have a program similar to the one now proposed for the state of Washington. For over eleven years, chiropractors in Colorado have been conducti ng PPEs for our school districts. I think we are one of the only states which allows chiropractors to do PPEs that requires a certification course with labs and a written test with recertif ication every two years. Chiropractors in my state have conducted thousands of examinations of this type without a single complication. Our course is heavy on the cardiac examination and the newest guidelines concerning concussions. We recertify every two years because the new international guidelines on concussion come out every two years (whether that would be Prague, Vienna, Zurich guidelines...they come out every two years) and we want our doctors to have the very latest information on this subject. The 18 hours proposed for the Washington State chiropractors is fair and sufficient based on the extensive knowledge and training that doctors of chiropractic already possess. The ACBSP, who oversees the CCSP and diplomate programs, set up the criteria for board certification in sports medicine with education that has the most current information that can be obtained and we have to have continuing education to maintain that certification. The ACBSP has, also, instituted a concussion certification course with recertification every two years. Participants from any profession may take the course and after completion, they are listed on a registry and receive a certificate from the ACBSP as well as from the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Even the monograph, which most people use for the pre-participation physical evaluation, 4 th addition, which is used for the Colorado program and the ACBSP sports medicine program, states: Many states allow healthcare professionals, other than MDs and DOs, to perform the evaluation. Regardless of their training, practitioners performing PPEs should completely screen athletes for the types of problems that would affect participation or place the athlete at undo risk. I believe that the training suggested for this program and the baseline education standard chiropractors already possess, will insure that the examination will be of the highest quality and a great benefit to the people of Washington State. Chiropractic Sunrise 127 Thank you for your time. I'm available for questions. DR. GARY SCHULTZ: Good morning. Point of clarification, Ms. Grassi indicated that I was vice-president for academic affairs and, as of July 1 st, I transitioned into being a full professor and chair of the clinical sciences department. I have only, in the last few days, been able to control the smile that has existed on my face since July 1st. So you'll understand if I just happen to crack a smile for no apparent reason whatsoever. It's been a wonderful transition. Can I just say that? Wonderful. I want to thank you for the opportunity to be heard today. A little bit, a very brief background, on where I've travelled. I am a board certified chiropractic radiologist. I did my residency in Los Angeles. I am currently vice-president for the American Chiropractic College of Radiology. I am, also, on the counsel for chiropractic education as a counselor and I also serve as the counselor at large member of the executive committee for the CCE. I am going to focus my comments today on the co re basic chiropractic physician training that exists. You'll understand that my reference point and my bias is the University of Western States, where I am employed and have been for the last seven years, but many of the comments that I am going to provide are generalizable to any chiropractic program across the country. For the record, I believe that the majority of practicing chiropractors in the state of Washington are UWS alumni. I want to provide you with some facts. I was astonished to hear some of the testimony from February and the lack of understanding and the lack of information in the core training in chiropractic. First of all, chiropractors are physicians and that's Code 5 RCW 18.25.090. Second of all, chiropractic physicians are trained in all the essential elements that are required in pre-participation evaluations and DOT physical ev aluations as a part of their core training. They have all of that information already. It is extremely important for the panel to understand that chiropractic physician training includes basic sciences education, clinical sciences education, and clinical experiences, which incorporate all areas of the body. It is not an education focused simply on the neuromuscular skeletal system as has been often referenced. Certainly, there is a focus in that area. That is the primary area of treatment for most chiropractic scopes but the evaluation, the critical thinking, the differential diagnosis of the education in those areas for chiropractic physicians is far broader than the area of treatment. So, yes, chiropractors do know how to auscultate the heart and lungs. Yes, they know how to do a neurological evaluation, a complete neurological evaluation. They are trained in differential diagnosis of closed head injuries and a variety of other conditions. They have course work in cardio-respiratory evaluation and diagnosis, gastrointestinal, genital/urinary, obstetrics, dermatology. So there is a very broad education focused on evaluation, differential diagnosis and diagnosis of any condition that would likely walk through an ambulatory care center's doors. That is why chiropractors are...in the Council of Chiropractic Education standards, they are required to be primary contact chiropractic physicians. So they are required to be able to evaluate, and to triage, and in some cases to manage pretty much anything that walks through the door; at the very least, they are responsible to be able know what they can and can't treat and to be able to refer appropriately for conditions they encounter that are not within their scope. The course work, as I have already referenced, is visible at the University of Western States website. Go to the doctor of the chiropractic program. You can see all of the coursework. There is over 4600 hours of education to include all the areas I have previously referenced. Chiropractic Sunrise 128I would next like to address some of the issues re lated to accreditation of chiropractic programs. As Dr. Nelson correctly observed, all but one chiropractic institution in the United States has regional accreditation through one of the six regional accreditors recognized by the Department of Education. In addition, every single chiropractic program in the United States has recognition by the Council of Chiropractic Education, which is the DOE recognized specialty accreditor for chiropractic programs. Within the 2013 standards of the CCE, there are reference points which help to guide the panel in understanding that the education chiropractic physicians receive is comprehensive and inclusive of all body system s, not just the musculoskeletal system, and I would direct your attention to Appendix 1, meta competency 1 and 2, as good starting points. Next, as if the standards for the CCE were not sufficient, every chiropractic physician who is eligible for licensure, I believe, in 47 states now, must complete a battery of four National Board of Chiropractic examiner examinations. The part 1 examination is focused on the basics sciences to include anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, toxicology, and pharmacology. Part 2 focuses on didactic clinical sciences. Part 3 focuses on critical thinking and differential diagnosis of clinical conditions and Part 4 is a practical examination which focuses on the skill set and critical thinking abilities of chiropractic physicians. These are pre- licensure requirements so it is clear that ch iropractors are well educated and they are frequently evaluated. They are competent to perform these basic procedures by the time they are licensed. In Washington State, chiropractors are licensed and I have heard testimony from past meetings that chiropractors are not licensed to perform these kinds of physicals. The reality is that, within, oh, gosh, I thought I had it written down...but within the rules for chiropractors they are allowed to evaluate for chiropractic lesions and to evaluate for those things that are not chiropractic lesions. That is certainly what we are looking for in this context. The last thing that I will share with you is that this core training that every chiropractor receives serves as a sound foundation and a base. I think the addition of additional training on top of that, for me, is icing on the cake. I'm available for questions. KRISTI WEEKS: Ok, at this time, does the panel have questions for this panel? MIKE WEISMAN: Can I ask a question? KRISTI WEEKS: You can ask whatever you want. That's what you are here for. MIKE WEISMAN: Ok. I have a couple of questions. I'd like you, sir, and I'm sorry you don't have name tags, umm, nice things like this, so I'm sorry Dr.? DR. ROBERT NELSON: Nelson. MIKE WEISMAN: Dr. Nelson. Dr. Nelson, could you just run through very briefly for me what you do when you conduct a PPE, that's a pre-performance? DR. ROBERT NELSON: Evaluation. MIKE WEISMAN: Evaluation. Yeah. I'd like to focus on that for just a second. You've been doing these for a while so go ahead and run with it. DR. ROBERT NELSON: The thing is, what we do is we follow the outline of the monograph that was produced by the ACSM and the major thing that happens is a history. 70% of the Chiropractic Sunrise 129problems that may be related to an athlete come up in the history. OK? And then the examination consists of an eye examination, eyes, ears, nose and throat, lung, cardiac... MIKE WEISMAN: Let me stop you for just a second. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Sure. MIKE WEISMAN: So do you have one of those charts that everyone uses for seeing in your office? DR. ROBERT NELSON: Yes MIKE WEISMAN: And then when you do ears, nose and throat, for example, do you have one of those scopes? I'm sorry but I don't know all the nicknames. DR. ROBERT NELSON: An otoscope, yes MIKE WEISMAN: An otoscope and you look at all that stuff. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Yes, we look in there...the Snellen chart...essentially what the PPE is concerned with is that the athlete is not what is termed \"one eyed\". So they must be at least 20/40 corrected to be able to participate in a collision sport. And so a Snellen chart evaluation will allow us to see what their acuity in their eyes are. We, also, look inside of the eyes to see if there is any bulging of the optic nerve or if there is any clogging of the arteries. We look in the nose for septal defects. We look in the ears. We look in the mouth for any lesions that may be there. We check the lymph glands. We do a full musculoskeletal examination to see if their joints are available or rehabbed enough to be able to participate in sports. We also do a hernia examination on male patients. We do a full body analysis. We check the viscera. We do all four quadrants of the abdominal area checking for an enlarged spleen or enlarged liver because hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are contraindication for participation in collision sports. Mostly in these individuals the splenomegaly comes up with mononucleosis, you know, and if they haven't recovered from that, they shouldn't be al lowed to be doing a collision sport. Also, you know, the thing is that when they come in fo r an examination, have they rehabbed from an ankle injury, I was skateboarding and twisted my ankle? Where's the mobility? Where's the proprioception? Where's the joint stability? Have you rehabbed this? All of those are questions. We do a full family history to make sure they haven't got any familial problems with heart. Has someone in your family suddenly died before the age of 50? Then you ask the question again - Have they died of a heart problem? Which leads you to that. Are you on asthma medication? The American Asthmatic Association wants their patients involved as athletes but you must be able to control that and make sure they have their emergency inhalers if necessary. Are you a diabetic? Is your diabetes controlled? The American Diabetic Association want their athletes being able to participate because it's better for their health but, you know, those things have to brought forward and either the doctor assigned to the team or coach should be aware that these individuals will either need their emergency inhaler or they'll need their insulin on hand in case of an emergency situation comes up. MIKE WEISMAN: I have a follow up question. When, you talked about looking inside the eye and also to use the otoscope. Where did you learn to do those things? Chiropractic Sunrise 130DR. ROBERT NELSON : Basic science course in chiropractic college. It is required for our examination. That is part of the core curriculum. MIKE WEISMAN: Are you telling us today that chiropractors here in Washington...is it your understanding that they are expected to do an exam like that when a patient comes to them? DR. ROBERT NELSON : If it is required for the condition that is presented, OK? The thing is that you don't do every examination for every patient. I'm not going to do genetic testing on somebody or I'm not going to do a blood test but you have to have the critical thinking when a patient presents to you what examinations you are going to conduct. So if someone comes in with migraines or something like that, sure, I'm going to evaluate the cervical spine but I'm also going to look inside the eyes and I'm going to see if there are any problems there, evaluate the blood pressure, so forth and so on. We have the skills to perform them but not any doctor, I don't care who it is, MD, DO, DC, they don't perform every exam they are trained in on every single patient but they have to make the evaluation, the decision, which ones to do. MIKE WEISMAN: Thank you for that clarification. And then I have a question for you, Dr. and I'm sorry I forgot your name. DR. GARY SCHULTZ: Schultz. MIKE WEISMAN: Dr. Schultz. Thank you. I'll make a note here. Dr. Schultz, so your in Western States down in Portland? DR. GARY SCHULTZ: I am. MIKE WEISMAN: So when students are going through your program, are they instructed to do all these kinds of exams? DR. GARY SCHULTZ: They are. MIKE WEISMAN: How does that occur? Does that occur on actor/patients or on each other? Or? I'm just kind of curious on how that instruction occurs. DR. GARY SCHULTZ: Sure. The short answer is all of the above. They receive didactic instruction. And they have in the basic c ourses, for example, they have two physical examination courses and two attending laboratory courses that go along with those lecture courses. In those courses in the laboratory skill development section, they practice on each other. They have a three course series just as they are entering the clinic. It's called, we call it, clean phase courses. Those are courses where they perform examination procedures and they are evaluated on those examination procedures on what we call \"standardized\" patients, which are actors and actresses which provide the appearance of having a problem. And when they are in their clinical training and internship, they also perform these examinations on outpatients who walk in through the doors. Our interns have educational opportunities in a variety of venues so they see quite a diversity of patients with a diversity of conditions. MIKE WEISMAN: So I have a question for you following up on what we just heard from Dr. Nelson. In this phase, with the standardiz ed patients, for example, do the students exam a patient with symptoms of like, for example, of like a detached retina or some sort of eye injury or close headed...some sort of neurological injury that might be from a closed head injury or Chiropractic Sunrise 131traumatic brain injury which, I think, we are all familiar with. There's a lot of concern these days about that with student athletes, both male and female. DR. GARY SCHULTZ: Yes. Yes, they do. MIKE WEISMAN: Are the standardized patients pediatric patients? DR. GARY SCHULTZ: Generally not. Generally not. They have a pediatrics course and children are brought in for demonstration purposes and for that. But, for obvious reasons, in a didactic educational setting like that, it is not an environment you want to subject kids to two hours of being examined by interns. MIKE WEISMAN: Ok. I can understand that. I understand that but I'm still trying to find out so, in the proposal that we are looking at here today, at least for the school physicals, all of these patients would be pediatric patients. DR. GARY SCHULTZ: Correct. MIKE WEISMAN: So I'm trying to put together how the practitioner gains experience examining those. DR. GARY SCHULTZ: They see children and adolescents through their internship. That is part of the outpatient experience. So they see patients of all age groups and all types. MIKE WEISMAN: Ok. But in their, well, and the internship is part of their education so that is something that is being supervised and graded and getting feedback and so forth. DR. GARY SCHULTZ: Absolutely. They will tell you way too much. MIKE WEISMAN: Ok. Let me see what else I have. One of the things that may be a part of this based on my research is making sure that patients are up-to-date in all their vaccinations. Does your school have a position on how chiropractors approach the issue of vaccinations? DR. GARY SCHULTZ: That is a very interesting question. To state that the institution has a position, a formal position for or against, is an ex tremely broad brush. If I had to give you that summary... MIKE WEISMAN: If I used imprecise language, I'm sorry. I don't want to assume anything. DR. GARY SCHULTZ: The institution in its public health courses and its microbiology and its toxicology courses, speaks to the issue of vaccinations. And if you are asking if the institution is pro or anti, has a patently anti immunization stance, absolutely not. The institution is favorably inclined to the responsible application of all necessary preventative measures for patients. So that includes immunizations where appropriate. Now there are, within the healthcare community, there are controversies. There are some immunization procedures which remain controversial and, as part of their education, students are provided both sides of that argument so that they can make an informed decision. As part of our.the institution has really focused on the use of evidence based practice methods and so as we go through teaching students procedures that they are going to perform and practice or advise they are going to give patients. We really try to force them to be informed about the most current healthcare literature on the Chiropractic Sunrise 132subject, to be understanding of and tolerant of differences of opinion based on controversies and gaps in the evidence. MIKE WEISMAN: Ok. One question I had was. I want go back to Dr. Nelson for a second. Are patients disrobed at any time during the exam? DR. ROBERT NELSON: Yes, they have to be appropriately dressed. Male patients are in shorts and females are in a tank top and shorts. MIKE WEISMAN: Is there any point in the evaluation, you mentioned a hernia exam. We don't need to get into too much detail but we can talk about what that involves very briefly. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Well, essentially what your checking for is hernias. MIKE WEISMAN: You're talking about inguinal. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Inguinal hernias, yes. And it is, not to be specific, but you glove up and you go upside of the scrotum and have them cough to see if there is a tapping back and forth. You are also, at that point, looking for in that athlete undescended testicles, single testicles and also checking for any masses because the leading cause of death in young people, as Lance Armstrong will tell you, is testicul ar cancer. And so those have to be some of the things that we test for. MIKE WEISMAN: Is there a similar kind of exam you would perform on female athletes as well? DR. ROBERT NELSON: The gentle urinary exam on females is not part of the PPE. MIKE WEISMAN: Ok, any thoughts on why that...I mean, you can probably tell us is it not deemed necessary? DR. ROBERT NELSON: Well, the thing is if you look at the warnings for the PPE. Let's say that a female came in with only one ovary, she can play any sports that she wants. But if a male comes in with only one testicle, he has to be warned to wear appropriate equipment and the consequences thereof. Also, the external exam on a male is more appropriate than an examination of a female. Internal examinations on females aren't until they turn adult. Now, part of the questioning on a female is when did they start their menses, how long have they started it? Have they had any gaps because y ou've to to wonder, number one, if they have primary or secondary amenorrhea or, if, gee, in high school this might happen, they might be pregnant. Ok? MIKE WEISMAN: Well, that was one of my questions. DR. ROBERT NELSON: So the thing is, is that part of the, if we have any concerns that we think that they are pregnant, then they must have a negative pregnancy test before they are allowed to participate or they have to be refe rred to an ob/gyn who can follow the pregnancy if allowed. Same thing if we find a person with only one kidney, ok, the kidney has been removed. For contact sports, they have to be followed by a nephrologist to allow for contact sports. MIKE WEISMAN: So just so I'm understanding kind of what would happen here. If, for example, a female athlete, and there are a lot of female athletes certainly, if a female athlete Chiropractic Sunrise 133had, for example, amenorrhea, a pause in menses at some point, and I know this is common among high performance female athletes, then the practitioner would refer them for follow up to another practitioner like an ob/gyn or something like that? DR. ROBERT NELSON: Well, the thing is that it depends on whether it is primary or secondary amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea means t hat they have not started their menses by the age of 16. Most females now because of the estrogens in the plastic bottles and so forth are starting at 12 and 13, OK? We also have to do their body fat analysis to determine if they are under 20 percent body fat because at under 20 percent body fat, the hormones stop producing and that's one of the reasons. Part of the thing is that comes from female athletic triad, which has been diagnosed. It started essentially in 1972 with passage of Title 9. At that time there were 1 in 27 females who were involved in sports. Now it's estimated that 1 in 3 females are involved in sports. And, so, with that as the body composition has changed. As an example, your Olympic gymnasts, as a rule our Olympic gymnasts are 20 pounds lighter than their counterparts were 20 years ago. That's a huge change. And, so, a female athletic triad cannot be done by one practitioner. It's a group effort. You have to have support, you have to have nutrition, you have to have maybe psychologic al, you have to do that to encourage them to at least gain enough weight or have the proper nutrition to regain their period. The thing that is concerning about that with the loss of menses, they are estimated to be able to lose about four percent of their bone mass per year, which can continue for at least four to five years after they regain their period. Now we've all been, we hear commercials from Sally Fields and everybody else, that they can regain, you know, their bone mass but it is felt now due to studies that bone loss lost in their teenage years and their young adulthood, twenties, is irreversible. So, you do the math, 20 times five, you know, 20 to 25 percent of bone loss that will never be recovered. And a recent study that was conducted on female athletic triad, they tried to find out what all was affected so they looked at their estrogen levels, their bone loss. Obviously, estrogen levels were down, bone loss was down, but what they also did was they measured the brachial artery's ability to expand, and they found that it was not being able to expand as well as it should, which, in essence, is hardening of the arteries at age 20. MIKE WEISMAN: So let me just interrupt you for a second. DR. ROBERT NELSON: I'm sorry. I get started on this and I just... (laughter) MIKE WEISMAN: Well, it's a very interesting area and it's really important because, as you indicate, so many women, young women, are today involved in sports. Many are high performance athletes and they certainly need attention and that's what these pre-performance exams are intended to do. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Right. MIKE WEISMAN: But so it sounds a little bit to me like a lot of female athletes are probably going to require a pre-performance exam to be provided by more than one practitioner. DR. ROBERT NELSON: If the conditions warrant it. I mean everything is, you know, condition warranted and I wouldn't say a lot, because, you know, not everyone has gone down below that 20 percent body fat. But, you know, if you are looking at high performance, if you look at any population, very little of it is hi gh performance. OK? I mean, you have very little elite athletes. Chiropractic Sunrise 134 MIKE WEISMAN: Well, as I understand it from the application, the pre-performance exams could go all the way up to age 21. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Correct. MIKE WEISMAN: So you would have college age. You would have women and men who are college age athletes. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Yes. And remember, the PPE is a screening exam. It is to find problems. And if you do find problems, then it is incumbent up on you to make the appropriate recommendations or referrals necessary. Less than one percent of all PPEs are denied access to participation. Ninety-nine percent are passed on because they don't have the red flags or they don't need the referral. So less than one percent but that's the job, is to find that one percent and if you do, then it is incumbent on a doctor, no matter who it is, to make the appropriate referrals. MIKE WEISMAN: I have a question for..let's follow up on that for a second. Then I have a question for you, Ms. Grassi, and that is, as you understand this proposal, would it include college age, you know, students, college age patients, who might be participating in sports at that level, is that something that is contemplated as well? LORI GRASSI: I suppose it would apply to that if they required a pre-participation examination in the same manner that an interscholastic athlete would. However, after age 18, a patient could self-refer themselves wherever they wan t. It would be incumbent upon the institution that they are an athlete for to require a particular form or examination type and then that institution usually would designate who's allowed to perform it if it's not explicit in their particular statute. MIKE WEISMAN: Well, I get that and I can imagine that, say, the University of Washington or maybe any other university or college that has student athletes might say to their students, you know, we require that these exams be conducted by a medical doctor or whatever they would say. So is it your proposal that their ability to limit that would be affected by the proposal that you're making? LORI GRASSI: I would say yes, because.. MIKE WEISMAN: So they couldn't so limit? LORI GRASSI: Correct, but I believe they couldn't so limit now because...I believe that under the way the scope is written, with this grammatical issue, it's possible that they could limit now. But at age 18, a patient can self-refer and chiropractic doesn't require a referral so if the institution limited to a particular provider type, it could possibly violate one of our anti- discrimination statutes. It would have to go to a lawyer, which I am not, to decide does this apply or not. But if it was simply which form did the institution require to be used on the exam and it be the same screening tool as an interscholastic sport, then if this were enacted, then a chiropractor would be able to perform it. MIKE WEISMAN: A minute ago, you talked about how if the particular university or college wanted athletes to be screened by, and they had their own process, and they said, well, you have to go see a medical doctor or an ARNP or something like that. If higher education can do that, why wouldn't K-12 be able to do that if they felt that was what they wanted to do? Chiropractic Sunrise 135 LORI GRASSI: They can do that today which is why we are here. Because the OSPI delegates the authority to the Washington Intersc holastic Activities Association, a nonprofit, which is why the bill was drafted the way it was because it was perceived that they were the entity blocking and they said no, if the statute is clear, more clear, that you can explicitly do these, then we don't have an opinion. We will write you into our guidelines. MIKE WEISMAN: Ok, but as I understand the proposal, then the proposal would be broader than just K-12 if the language that you are proposing, or something like it, because I understand it could very well change, it would also effect students over the age of 18 who might be involved in collegiate athletics as well. LORI GRASSI: I would agree and I don't believe our report was intended to limit to K-12. It was just the examples that we have at this time and the way the bill was drafted at the initial phase. MIKE WEISMAN: Ok. And, Dr. Nelson, it sounds like you are also doing exams at the collegiate level in your practice as well. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Well, I am if allowed but remember the collegiate level involves scholarships and that's a contractual agreement and you cannot break contractual law. I am giving you a scholarship. If you want the scholarship, you follow our rules. MIKE WEISMAN: Well, those are for scholarship athletes, which is a tiny... DR. ROBERT NELSON: It's a tiny but, you know, you're talking about intermural and so forth and so on. MIKE WEISMAN: Yeah, most athletes, even in varsity sports and intermural sports and everything, are not on scholarship. DR. ROBERT NELSON: No. MIKE WEISMAN: And I know the universities have some sort of pre-screening they want you to do. And you're doing those now and those are basically adult.. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Yeah, they're adult and, you know, we do adolescents, we do juveniles, we do young adults, we do, you know, older adults who want to start engaging in sports. Say you want to start an exercise pr ogram, let's do the physical before you get involved in this. I think it's only safe and prudent. MIKE WEISMAN: Ok, all right, I'm going to take a pass now for a while since I've asked you a lot of questions. Thank you so much for your responses. I really appreciate it. KRISTI WEEKS: Shannon? Vicki? VICKI BOUVIER: I do but you can go first. SHANNON WALKER: Actually, you answered all of the questions I had so go ahead. Chiropractic Sunrise 136VICKI BOUVIER: I apologize. I'm terrible with names. Ms. Grassi, you had said that there are 25 doctors in Washington State who perform the CLE exam. LORI GRASSI: Well, there are currently 25 doctors in the registry. VICKI BOUVIER: In the registry... LORI GRASSI: Which isn't effective until 2014. VICKI BOUVIER: Ok. And since you view this as a scope clarification of the statute, are there chiropractors who are registered and performing these exams right now? LORI GRASSI: Not in Washington State. No, because the federal registry will not accept them until we correct the statute. VICKI BOUVIER: The statute? LORI GRASSI: Because it does not explicitly call out DOT, they won't. There are two states. You can address this better than I can but there are two states that the federal government is not allowing chiropractors because of the way the scope of practice is drafted. Washington is one and I don't recall the other. VICKI BOUVIER: And the other states that allow it, they have statutes that explicitly identify the DOT exam or... DR. ROBERT NELSON: The language allows for it. For the physical examinations. I'm not familiar with the exact language that they are talking about but in 48 states, chiropractors are taking the same examinations as MDs and DOs and are performing and have clinics open for DOT physicals. LORI GRASSI: This goes to the issue of the grammatical issue that the Chiropractor Quality Assurance Commission Assistant Attorney General initially recommended a grammatical change and I couldn't come up with where it was supposed to be at the time but it was to add \"and/or\". And when that was proposed back to us, we... MIKE WEISMAN: Do you know which section it was supposed to be in? LORI GRASSI: It would be in sub three, 18.25.005 sub 3, and I believe line, well on mine. It would be \"as part of the chiropractic different ial diagnosis, a chiropractor shall perform a physical examination, which may include diagnost ic x-rays\" and I'm not exactly positive where that and/or goes because I am not a lawyer, but I believe it was here.. \"and/or to determine the appropriateness of chiropractic care.\" And there may be others that, in the room, I'm just not sure. I'd have to ask some people if they recall this. But it didn't seem a clear enough resolution to the issue when we went to two lawyers outside of our own lawyer and the Assistant AG's recommendation, because we felt it that would only result in a battle and a legal challenge with the professions that oppose us already and we preferred to be more clear and address the issue straightforward. MIKE WEISMAN: Ok, I understand. KRISTI WEEKS: Vicki, did that answer your question? Chiropractic Sunrise 137 VICKI BOUVIER: Umm, yeah. KRISTI WEEKS: Do you have any others? VICKI BOUVIER: Yes, let me look at my notes. Dr. Nelson, you said that in Colorado, chiropractors have performed thousands of PPE exams without a single complication. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Correct. VICKI BOUVIER: What does that mean? DR. ROBERT NELSON: What that means is that if someone cleared them for a PPE, you know, cleared them for competition and then, later on, a situation arise where there was a misdiagnosis or an undetected. There have been none of those in eleven years. VICKI BOUVIER: Ok. And then, Ms. Grassi, maybe you can explain this to me or maybe you have an idea on this. How many people in Washington State use chiropractors for their primary care physicians? LORI GRASSI: That's an interesting question. How many patients? I saw a study recently in the last couple of weeks that is not yet published so I saw pre-data, that said throughout the country the average, the chiropractic penetration of the public is somewhere between eight and twelve percent but I don't have any of the caveats on the study. I have nothing to reference but it is just one thing that I remember from a study. You know, the general population of consumers who seek chiropractic care is dramat ically less than what seeks other providers for primary care. VICKI BOUVIER: That's all I have now. You've answered all my other questions. KRISTI WEEKS: Shannon, do you have one now? SHANNON WALKER: I have a follow up. KRISTI WEEKS: Speak up. SHANNON WALKER: I do have a follow up question. And we are talking about the information that we don't, that there has not been an adverse diagnosis. Is that a reporting requirement? How do we know for sure that there has been no adverse... DR. ROBERT NELSON: No reports have been made to CHSAA, the Colorado High School Activities Association. SHANNON WALKER: Ok. So that's where you are getting your information. DR. ROBERT NELSON: Yes. SHANNON WALKER: Is that a required reporting? DR. ROBERT NELSON: There is not a required reporting, but no incident has been reported. Chiropractic Sunrise 138SHANNON WALKER: Ok, so that, ok. Thank you. MICHAEL WEISMAN: I have a couple of follow up questions. Ms. Grassi, do chiropractors today perform school exams? As I, forgive me if I'm not stating this accurately. As I understand, there is a difference between a school entry exam and a sports exam. I may be wrong on that. Is that accurate or close? LORI GRASSI: I may have to defer that to a practicing chiropractor but it is my understanding that anybody under 18 would need an adult to bring them in or to give them permission to see a chiropractor or any provider for that matter. Depending on what the need is. I know that females can seek other care pending certain laws. But I would say a chiropractor does not perform a school exam differently than any other exam they would do on a child, such as scoliosis screening and things like that because of the way the scope is written today. Our association has been very clear in educating chiropractors in the state for the 13 years I have been there that you don't perform these exams because you'll get in trouble. It is not in your scope and until we clarify it your scope, don't do it. So we've been telling people not to do it. In terms of what might differentiate between a PPE and a school exam, I would have to...I know there is a chiropractor who is going to testify and he may be able to address that. MICHAEL WEISMAN: Ok, I'll save that one. But I want to address another question to Dr. Nelson since you're the practitioner who's doing this most and seems... Do you carry malpractice, sir? DR. ROBERT NELSON: Yes, $1,000,000/$3,000,000. MICHAEL WEISMAN: And so is this something...is this particular scope doing these kinds of exams something that was of interest to your malpractice carrier? DR. ROBERT NELSON: No. MICHAEL WEISMAN: No. They didn't charge anything different for this kind of thing? DR. ROBERT NELSON: They don't charge for me going to any other state even when I follow the Colorado Rodeo. I just have to inform them. MICHAEL WEISMAN: And back to Ms. Grassi then for a second. The proposal, as I read it, proposes that the chiropractic, that the Chiropractic Quality Assurance Commission would maintain some sort of certification list or something like that, that would...it says it would be online or it would be public. I'm not quite sure about how that would look. Can you fill me in on what you have in mind? LORI GRASSI: Yes, the legislature would have to direct by statute what the commission should do in order to implement this type of legislation. And one idea that we had is the extensive website for the Department of Health clearly delineates, say, a chiropractor and a chiropractic x-ray technician, much like the physical therapy profession. There's physical therapist, physical therapy aide, physical therapy assistant. So you would designate in that manner. And those that did the training for the PPEs and DOTs would submit that and the commission would have to implement that and create a separate category for endorsement is what I was looking for. It would appear when you do a search of professions. It would appear that way. MICHAEL WEISMAN: So when you looked that person up, that would appear? Chiropractic Sunrise 139 LORI GRASSI: Yes. MICHAEL WEISMAN: Ok. LORI GRASSI: And I'm predicting what legislation, what a bill would look like, but that was our proposal. MICHAEL WEISMAN: Yeah, ok. And would the Chiropractic Quality Assurance Commission then be in charge of certifying these individuals? I mean, it seems to me, and I'm just guessing, that your proposal anticipates that they would somehow have to make these endorsements. You know, that there would be some paperwork involved certainly, but that they would have to somehow process all of that and determine if the person was qualified. LORI GRASSI: We would expect that to occur and that there would be a fee attached to those who would want the endorsement because the statute requires that all licensing of health professions be...you pay for yourself basically. MICHAEL WEISMAN: Self supporting. Ok. All right. OK. Thanks. Thank you. LORI GRASSI: Thank you. KRISTI WEEKS: Anything else? Ok. We will now take public testimony. You will be called up in the order in which you signed in. First, we will have Jason Passey from the Washington State Chiropractors Association. JASON PASSEY: Do I come up here? KRISTI WEEKS: You do. Please come up, identify yourself and speak into the microphone. DR. JASON PASSEY: Well, my name is Dr. Jason Passey. I am a practicing chiropractor, actually, here in Olympia. I have been in practice for about five and a half years now. So I just wanted to testify to a couple of points based on what I saw with the February testimony and hearing and then some of the comments I have heard. First of all, there are two big issues. One, fr om a chiropractic perspective, I would like to speak to the issue of...well, actually, to answer your question, Mr. Weisman. You asked about pre-participation exams versus school entrance exam s and, in all honesty, I'm not familiar with a special school entrance exam that differentiates from a pre-participation exam, so, from my perspective. There may be something else, but I'm not aware of one. MICHAEL WEISMAN: Ok. DR. JASON PASSEY: As a chiropractor, one of my big concerns is access especially in this city. Just yesterday I was on the phone with a radiologist with South Sound Radiology discussing a patient of mine who was in a motor vehicle accident and, between her and I, we have contacted at least 10 offices and she is unable to get in with any primary care provider because nobody is taking new patients in this area. And he, the radiologist, told me that, he, himself, when he has family or friends that needs primary care, he has to make personal phone calls and call in favors just to get somebody into an appointment. So, we as chiropractors, many times, we act as the primary care portal of entry to many of our patients. And if we have Chiropractic Sunrise 140the ability to perform these exams, it will expand t heir access to those things without having to get on a three or four month wait list to get into an office especially with DOT physicals where that's the person livelihood. They may need that within days. And if it takes them three or four months because they are new in town, that's not a good thing. Also, I'd like to speak to the point that as chiropractors, as primary care for many of our patients, we do know their medical history best many ti mes and that should be taken into account when doing this type of exam versus if they just go to the clinic that is just whipping through 50 of these in a hour just to sign the paperwork. We can actually do a much better job of knowing their history and knowing their family history and that sort of a thing. Speaking to the training, I can speak first hand. I am a graduate of the University of Western States and I can attest that my training is very thorough in all of the aspects that a PPE requires. And what we are proposing with the additional training, the certification that will take place every two years, is not to replace that training but just to keep brushed up on it and to keep current. That's the second point I want to address is I know there is a concern about safety, especially with pediatrics and our children. They are a specialized group that we want to be very careful of. First of all, we are not trying to replace their pediatricians. We are not trying to replace the cardiologist. We are simply trying to offer our services to help with the screening process to make appropriate referrals as Dr. Nelson attested to. I read a research study. The British Journal of Sports Medicine actually published a study early this year in which they said that only, it was self-reported from over a thousand physicians, all of which were from Washington State for this study. And it says that only 47 percent of practicing physicians even are familiar with the current American Heart Association ballpoint guidelines for cardiac review in a PPE. And only 5.7 perc ent of physicians currently adhere to those guidelines 100% of the time. By proposing that we have extra training of chiropractors every two years, insures that they are up to date on all of that, and that they utilize that consistently which, to me, is quite frightening if only 5.7 percent of physicians are currently using that knowledge and less than half are even aware of t hose guidelines. They are not proposing, or, we are proposing that make the people doing these a very safe thing and that they are aware of the guidelines and are using those appropriately. So those are the comments I wanted to attest to. I'll answer any questions you may have for me. KRISTI WEEKS : Questions? VICKI BOUVIER: I do have a question. DR. JASON PASSEY: Yes? VICKI BOUVIER: What percentage of your clients seek you out as a primary care practitioner? DR. JASON PASSEY: You know, I have never actually pooled the statistics. If I were to take kind of an intuitive guess on that, I would say roughly 15 - 20 percent of my patients come in and don't really have established other care currently. But I do try to work consistently with patients who do have established primary care to make sure that we do proper cross referrals, coordination of care, that sort of thing. So, again, we are not trying to replace any other Chiropractic Sunrise 141profession. We are just trying to help and make access a little easier and to screen as appropriate. VICKI BOUVIER: Are there differences in the way that you treat those patients who have you as their primary care provider as opposed to a patient that who has a primary care physician already? Aside from the cross communication. DR. JASON PASSEY: You know, as far as treatment and exam, there's not a whole lot of difference. I think the biggest difference those that use us more for primary care, I do an awful lot of coordination with specialists. I make a lot phone calls to, you know, the orthopedist to try to find them appropriate referrals. I do a lot of referral for diagnostic imaging. We can refer out for blood work as appropriate for patients that need that. So in that sense, it's different. There's a little more work involved. MICHAEL WEISMANN: I have.... VICKI BOUVIER: Do you.. MICHAEL WEISMANN: Oh, go ahead. VICKI BOUVIER: And you interpret their lab results and their x-rays? DR. JASON PASSEY: Yes. We're well trained in all of that and, like I said, just yesterday I was on the phone with the radiologist to get some clarification on a few things to make sure we got appropriate case management for the results of that particular exam. VICKI BOUVIER: I'm done. MICHAEL WEISMANN: I've just got...following up on Vicki's question. So when you refer patients out for blood work or for panels, you review that...the results because I guess no one else is doing it? DR. JASON PASSEY: Yeah. MICHAEL WEISMANN: You're their primary. You're reviewing all those results and you're making the diagnosis based on that information. DR. JASON PASSEY: And, again, you know, I do that...when I do that as a screening procedure, if something comes up of concern, then I seek the appropriate referral with somebody who is more qualified for management of that claim. But you know, but acting as primary care, it's kind of my job to try to diagnose if there is something out of the ordinary that does need further management outside of my scope. I'm not too proud to send them out to the appropriate place to do that. MICHAEL WEISMANN: Ok, Well, maybe I'm just not tracking something but these patients, if what you're seeing, if a panel comes back and you see values that might indicate that a patient has cancer or a patient has diabetes, how are you getting them into see somebody if nobody is taking patients? I'm not quite tracking how this is... DR. JASON PASSEY: Well, the difference there is portal of entry primary care versus specialist. Specialists will always take referrals from other healthcare providers, granted it may Chiropractic Sunrise 142not be the next day, but you can get them in versus just trying to find somebody to just have a general primary care medical doctor who can see them for whatever ailment they may have as their portal of entry. That's the difference there. MICHAEL WEISMANN: Ok. So you're referring people generally to specialists? DR. JASON PASSEY: Yes. MICHAEL WEISMANN: So they're taking your referrals? DR. JASON PASSEY: Or those who may already have established primary care, I may refer them back to that primary care for the follow up to some outside my scope. MICHAEL WEISMANN: Ok. When you do chiropractic exams, is there any point at which the patient is disrobed? DR. JASON PASSEY: Again, as Dr. Nelson indicated, as appropriate. Generally, at the intial examination, I do like access to the back. It's not a complete disrobe but, you know, you want to check to skin lesions and check what we can see as far as bony landmarks and that sort of thing so, yes, as appropriate. MICHAEL WEISMANN: That's all I have. KRISTI WEEKS: Thank you. Next up, we have Carl Nelson from the Washington State Medical Association. CARL NELSON: Good morning. I'm Carl Nelson from the Washington State Medical Association representing 9,800 physicians and physician assistants here today in opposition to this proposal. The WSMA is opposed to expanding the scope of practice for licensed chiropractors to include the performance of sports exams and commercia l driver's licenses. The decision to exclude doctors of chiropractic is well founded and based on the fact that physicians and osteopathic physicians have more training, particularly in the areas of cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological. And those are the areas the legislature has said we don't want to see anymore headlines of kids going down on basketball courts and football games from undetected, undiagnosed diseases. Regarding the licensure of commercial drivers' lic enses, if you look at the literature on the internet at least, the three major things they talk about are sleep apnea, medicine abuse and misuse and cardiac care. And those, again, are three areas which physicians and osteopathic physicians, PAs and the others are well trained. Much more trained than the chiropractors are in their course of training. With regard to demand for services, even though ther e is a significant demand for services for physical examinations for sports physicals in particular, the athletic...allowing chiropractors to perform them at the cost of quality is not a benefit to the public. It puts individuals at risk of injury in our opinion. Chiropractors provid ing these exams delays the healthcare services, creates additional expenses for the patients and again puts the athlete at risk. We strongly dispute the claims of the chiroprac tic perform these two types of examinations certainly, as stated, the WSCA stated that because doctors are regulated under RCW 18.25., Chiropractic Sunrise 143they would be capable of performing these drivers' exams, that doesn't even go into effect until next year. And so the numbers of practitioners signed up for that may vary, change from the existing 24 to a larger number as we get closer to implementation of that Act. To the extent, I want to address issue as to the extent to which consumers need or would benefit from the proposed legislation, even with additional training and certification, chiropractors lack the training, experience and knowledge to insure complete and comprehensive sports and commercial drivers' license exams. Allowing chiropractors to perform these exams would endanger patients by increasing the risk of dangerous health conditions would be unidentified, undetected or misdiagnosed. And, again, we doubt that an additional 18 hours of training will make the difference here. If you look at page four of our submission, you will see the beginnings of a chart that outlines the difference between the chiropractic training and the physician training. Just as an example, a medical student will do a rotation in urology that may be for six weeks, 80 hours a week, just at the beginning then is a 480-hour rotation through one specialty, let alone all of the others that they have to go through before they even finish medical school and start their residencies. The extent of the autonomy a practitioner, as indicated, will impact this and, again, I'm trying to run down the statutory and it gets kind of lengthy and I'm trying to abbreviate for you. The additional training for chiropractors fails to adequately prepare doctors of chiropractic for the wide array of medical issues. Again, I refer back to that and if you look at the whole AMA document that was submitted to you, it gets into even more detail than what was submitted there. We believe that the amount of training, education and expertise proposed by WSCA would not adequately prepare doctors of chiropractic to perform complete and comprehensive exams. We do not disagree, however, with WSCA's statement that primary care medicine is an underserved needed healthcare. However, the fact that the public could benefit from increased access to primary care services does not support the claim that chiropractors should have an expanded scope of practice to allow for the performance of sports and commercial drivers' license exams. And, then, lastly, once again, we disagree that chiropractors should have an extended scope of practice to allow sports and commercial driver's license exams, and, therefore, we believe that they should not be listed as being qualified to do such. And, being more specific about the piece of legislation, the legislation is really quite broad and we think it's overly broad and not the way to proceed. One of the reasons that is before you is the legislature didn't want to deal with it and so they sent it to you, is typical in pieces of scope of practice legislation that they are not comfortable with. So we urge you to reject this piece of legislation. We believe that it won't enhance access to physical examinations; that the cu rrent system works as well as it can. The public, the legislature and the professions are demanding for a tighter, more thorough review of, particularly, of student athletes so that the undetected diseases don't strike them down in their youth. The same with the driver's licenses. The legislature, once again, doesn't like seeing headlines about busses crashing and killing people. What they want is a more stringent review. Probably we could anticipate legislation that w ould require them to undergo more specialized type training rather than less. Same with student athletes. They are more likely to see public health officials and educators move in that direction than in the direction of the proposed legislation here. So, once again, we urge that you reject the legislation. Thank you. I'll take any questions you have. KRISTI WEEKS: Questions for Mr. Nelson? Chiropractic Sunrise 144 SHANNON WALKER: I don't have any. Thank you. CARL NELSON: Good. KRISTI WEEKS: Next up we have Richard O'Leary. RICHARD O'LEARY: Good morning to each of you. And, in advance, thank you for your time. I appreciate you taking the time and allowing me to speak. I am here not as a representative of any association. I am here as a public citizen. I happen to be an athletic director at a high school in the area. So, in that role, I have the ultimate responsibility for the health and safety of nearly a thousand student athletes. I am particularly concerned about the proposal in front of us today. I would like to address a number of points starting with the misunderstanding that seems to be out there about chiropractors. I can see how that misunderstanding would occur because there were statements made this morning that were simply not factual. Dr. Nelson, for example, I believe it was, stated that chiropractors, the sports chiropractors, are the ones we are talking about as being trained to do the sports physicals and, yet, his colleague Dr. Schultz said that all chiropractors are prepared and trained to do the sports physicals. So I am confused about which we are talking about. Ok? It was indicated that the sports chiropractor's recertify for their DOT exams every two years because the concussion guidelines are released every two years. In fact, those concussion guidelines come out every four years. The Prague, Vienna, etc., Zurich conferences have occurred in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012. I'm no expert in math but I believe that is every four years, not two. I have no long-standing bias here. I have a cousin who is a chiropractor. I've been treated by a chiropractor. My mother has been treated by a chiropractor. I have never seen my cousin carry a stethoscope. In my mother's and my trips to chiropractors, I have never had my heart or lungs listened to by a chiropractor. In youth sports, there are three things that kill young athletes; heat, head and heart. The University of...in a submission by the Universi ty of Western States, they gave you quite an elaborate listing of the clock hours that their students spend learning things including the brain. Neuromuscular diagnosis 1, 2, 3, neuroanatom y, neurophysiology; well over a hundred, maybe even two hundred clock hours. Mr. Weismann, you asked them to...asked the folks to explain the particulars of a pre-participation physical ex am. If you play back the tape, you will find that never once did they mention cardiovascular. That is my concern - the cardiovascular. There are too many young people dying from undiagnosed heart conditions, and, yes, maybe 70 percent of those are picked up by history but the physical exam is an important part of it too. History and physical together are what catch those things, not just the history. If it was all about history, I could take a physical because I can read the questionnaire. But there is much more to it than that. As an athletic director, I have a number of coaches, approximately 30, who have their CDLs and we have never had a problem getting their medical exams done. Most of them, not most but many, of my student s see their doctors once a year. And they see their doctor once a year because we require thei r medical exams once a year. Without that requirement for physicals, doctors tell me some of those children would not get their immunizations. So if the chiropractors can't immunize, we're talking about an added burden on the healthcare system. Going to chiropractors for their physical and then to their family practice physician for their immunizations. And as you know, at the high school age, there are a number Chiropractic Sunrise 145of immunizations that are either required or certainly very important, not the least of which would be the HPV series. Another source of misunderstanding, I believe it was Dr. Nelson made the comment that testicular cancer is the leading cause of death in young people. I pulled up the Centers for Disease Control website. The five leading causes of death among people age 10-24 years as of 2010, testicular cancer is not listed there anywhere. And, at another website, the worldlifeexpectancy.com - USA causes of death by age and gender-for ages 0-14 and 15-24, nowhere in the top 50 causes of death is testicular cancer listed so I am not sure what he was talking about there other than maybe trying to smoke screen the committee here. Cardiac assessment is the key to saving lives in a pre-participation physi cal exam. I simply don't see, in their training, where that assessment occurs, where that knowledge occurs or is gained. On the University of Western States website I can only find one course that addresses cardiorespiratory or cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. That is their course number CSC 7163. It is a three credit class, 33 clock hours. For comparisons sake, they have two taping and splinting laboratory classes, a total of 2 credits, a total of 22 clock hours. I have coaches that do taping ankles and wrists and things. If we are only talking about 50 percent more training than for taping and splinting, I think there is something wrong. If chiropractors' training was appropriate for performing PPEs, why are they not authorized to prescribe medications? They talked about diagnos ing medical conditions, I would have liked to have heard them describe how they diagnose asth ma and what they would do then once that diagnosis is reached. Do they refer to a pulmonologist? Do they refer to someone else? If they can't provide a rescue inhaler or long term ma nagement medication themselves, what are they doing? That was never addressed. I would have liked to have heard them describe what an S3 heart sound sounds like and what that would mean in terms of a physical exam. Why that would be abnormal. What risk...what additional risk that athlete might have because of that. Mr. Weismann, I believe you asked the question about collegiate sports. The NCAA requires that a DO or an MD perform the physical exams for all collegiate athletics, whether they are scholarship athletes or not. The only exceptions to that are ARNPs or PAs working directly under the MDs and DOs, not sole practitioners. So when Ms. Grassi said the institution can designate who can perform, it's already been done by the NCAA. And in their wisdom, whatever that might be, the NCAA has not seen fit to allow chiropractors or, again, even ARNPs or PAs unless supervised by an MD or DO. Ms. Grassi made the point about obstetricians not doing certain evaluations and, you know, staying within their scope. I may not like the fact that in this state an obstetrician can sign a sports physi cal for one of my athletes but I accept that because I know that at least that obstetrician has had not only four years of medical school but several years after that of residency. I also know that every time during our three pregnancies that my wife went in for an evaluation, she had a complete heart and lung evaluation by her obstetrician. So I do feel confident in that regard, at least, that, yes, while an obstetrician may not be specializing in sports physicals, they've got an awful lot of experience listening to hearts and lungs. I thank you all for your time and, again, I am greatly opposed to this proposal. KRISTI WEEKS: Done? RICHARD O'LEARY: Yes. Chiropractic Sunrise 146KRISTI WEEKS: questions? MICHAEL WEISMANN: I have a question. Mr. O'Leary, have you ever had a student that was not cleared for participation by the exam. RICHARD O'LEARY: Yes. In fact... MICHAEL WEISMANN: What's your experience on that? RICHARD O'LEARY: We host sports physicals at our school annually. I bring in about 20 doctors. I bring in specialists from every area and we set up stations. The musculoskeletal exam is done by an orthopedist. The internal medicine exam - heart, lungs - is done by an internal medicine folks and family practice physicians. I always have at least one cardiologist who can give an immediate second opinion about murmurs that are heard, about anything that is abnormal in the area of cardiovascular. We average about six to seven percent that need some sort of follow up or some sort of second opinion, whether it be the cardiologist right there or further workup for abnormal heart sounds, family history, things like that. Those are usually benign issues that are quickly resolved, but, again, it takes even those experts there on site saying we need to delve a little deeper. And I am confident that those people have the knowledge and the training to make those decisions. I don't have that confidence about the chiropractors. I think chiropractors have a place in the sports medicine team. Dr. Nelson, I believe, described himself as the team chiropracto r. That's a big distinction between the team physician and the team chiropractor. Chiropracto rs are on our sports medicine team but they are not EMTs. They are not PTs. They are not athletic trainers. They are not the team physician. They are one piece of the sports medicine team, not the sole provider. I hope I answered your question before I got a little off topic there. MICHAEL WEISMANN: Yeah, I think the proposal is, as I understand it, is that a chiropractor, for example, if they discerned an issue, they would refer the person on for a second opinion. RICHARD O'LEARY: And my answer would... MICHAEL WEISMANN: I don't think they would be necessarily in all cases making a final decision but that's up to their licensure. RICHARD O'LEARY: Sure and my answer to that would be how do you know to refer if your training does not tell you that you are seeing or hearing something abnormal? And, again, if we go back to their training, at least from their website, I don't see where 33 clock hours is enough to really learn the intricacies of the cardiovascular system. Any other questions? Ok. Well, thank you again for your time. KRISTI WEEKS: Ok. Next up we have...Oh, sorry. I'm just motoring through it. I promised them a break. So we will take five minutes and come back in five. Thank you. <BREAK> <RESUME> KRISTI WEEKS: Ok, folks we are going to go ahead and get started. The next person who is scheduled to testify, I hope she has returned if she left, is Darla Varrenti. Ok. Chiropractic Sunrise 147DARLA VARRENTI : Thank you for allowing me to speak this morning. My name is Darla Varrenti and I am Executive Director for the Nick of Time Foundation. We are a non-profit that is based here in Washington State and our sole purpose is focusing on sudden cardiac arrest awareness and sudden cardiac arrest prevention in children and young adults. I am here today to express my strong concern a bout extending the current chiropractic scope of practice to allow chiropractors to perform sports physicals and driver license examinations. Our foundation, along with several other groups in our state, have been working very hard to get the current PPE revised and updated to provide the best possible exam that young athletes need. Supporting this change in the chiropractic scope of practice would be a huge step backwards. Young athletes need a complete evaluation that includes an ECG and pre-concussion testing before being cleared for sports. Chiropractors are not trained or licensed to provide this kind of physical to keep our young athletes safe. This proposal is contrary to continued efforts in the medical community to improve athletes' safety on the playing field. Chiropractors are not trained in providing comprehensive medical services, including cardiovascular and other internal medical conditions which are, in fact, the most critical components of these evaluations. The musculoskeletal portions of these examinations, while important, is only a portion of these physicals. Sudden cardiac death from an underlying heart condition is the leading cause of death in exercising young athletes not cancer as the doctor stated. I know firsthand the devastation this causes the families and communities as my 16-year-old son, Nicholas, a multi-sport athlete, died from sudden cardiac arrest in 2004. There has been extensive medical work done on preventing sudden cardiac death in young athletes that is based on trained evaluation of the history and physical. There is, also, a growing recognition of the critical importance of assessing for prior head injuries and concussions in a highly structured and rigorous process. I support multidisciplinary approaches to healthcare and believe in all specialties practicing the full scope of what they are trained to do completely. Chiropractors are simply not trained to conduct a complete medical sports physical. The NCAA does not allow chiropractors to perform pre-participation physicals for these reasons. The assertion that chiropractors can simply evaluate medical conditions, especially ones that place young athletes at risk for sudden death and catastrophic outcomes, is risky. Our foundation is pushing for stricter guidelines and a more in depth look at the heart for future PPEs. There was an email and some conversation that I exchanged with Ms. Grassi from the chiropractic association and we talked about chiroprac tors listening to kids' hearts. She said not all 104 DCs that are certified in Washington State may not be able to oscillate a heart as well as cardiologists but I, also, feel that they may not be able to do it was well as a family physician just, simply, because they don't do it as often. The medical professionals who currently conduct PPEs work in pediatrics or family medicine clin ics and evaluate kids all the time for medical issues pertinent to the PPEs, well child exams, fa mily histories, asthma, chest pain and illness. I do not believe that the general chiropractor evaluates medical issues such as these on a regular basis and I suspect that the reason for a visit to the chiropractor's office is predominately, if not entirely, musculoskeletal. If you do not conduct these evaluations on a regular basis, I'm not sure that it matters if you once learned about the heart and other systems. The idea that it doesn't seem to be an issue with the group is troubling to me. Listening is not enough. History and physical is not enough. At the very least, an EKG needs to be performed to also take a picture of the heart. These conditions that kill young people and young athletes Chiropractic Sunrise 148from sudden cardiac arrest, you can't hear them. You have to take a picture. At the very least an EKG needs to be done and I don't even know how many, if any, of the chiropractors' offices have an EKG machines. I am in agreement with the other groups represented here today that a good chiropractor is a useful partner in a complete program of care but sport physicals are not something that should be done by anyone other than a licensed physician. There will always be those families who seek out the care of a chiropractor for a variety of things but we hope by educating the public about how important comprehensive heart health is for our young people, they will think twice about getting a less than thorough PPE or sports evaluation. I believe that there are enough interested parties who will work to make sure enough questions are raised to insure that this proposal is not passed out of your committee. In a perfect world, everyone will work together in each of their specific fields to make sure our young people are healthy and perfectly safe to play the sport they love. Thank you. KRISTI WEEKS: Any questions? MICHAEL WEISMANN: I have a question. Do you know how many, what the instances is of sudden cardiac death in Washington? DARLA VARRENTI: Not in Washington but I know nationwide they estimate between 4,000 and 6,000 children each year suffer sudden cardiac arrest. One of our programs through our foundation we do youth heart screenings because we know that the PPEs are not enough. We go into schools every month throughout the school year and conduct heart screenings on the students that come. It's a voluntary thing. We do up to 500 students at a time and, based on our numbers, we are in partnership with the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, we find one percent of the children that we screen have some kind of underlying heart condition that needs referral. We've had children that have had all kinds of procedures done, including open heart surgery, from underlying heart conditions that their parents had no idea and weren't picked up on a PPE, a normal PPE, without an EKG. So this is something that we feel very strongly about. That is what my son died from, an underlying heart condition, that we had no idea that he had. He'd had a sports physical five months before and it wasn't picked up. So this is not something to take lightly. This is something that needs to be more strict and more strident in the testing that is done to be able to pick these conditions up. MICHAEL WEISMANN: Thank you. DARLA VARRENTI: Thank you. KRISTI WEEKS: Thank you very much. And next we hav e Dr. Joe Pfeifer from University of Western States. DR. JOSEPH PFEIFER: Good morning. Thanks for the opportunity to address you. I'm Joe Pfeifer. I am a chiropractic physician and the vice president of clinic affairs for the University of Western States. While I am licensed and work in Oregon, I am also a resident of the state of Washington and have two students in the school district as well. I'm here today to address some of the information about chiropractic clinical education and training, specifically, with respect to the competency requirements of the undergraduate training of chiropractors. In doing so, I hope to clarify some of the misconceptions that came out in the earlier testimony, including some of the testimony that was provided today with regard to the Chiropractic Sunrise 149misperception about chiropractors being limited to the diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal conditions. While it is true that the musculoskeletal system is an area of chiropractic specialty and expertise, chiropractors are also trained to evaluate whole body systems in their whole patient approach to healthcare. Chiropractic physician perform and interpret through medical histories. They perform and interpret a wide variety of physical examination procedures including vital signs, including cardiac auscultation, and a complete cardio-pulmonary examination as well as neurological exams of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The order and routine and advanced diagnostic tests apply widely accepted differential diagnostic material to determine the nature of patients' conditions and determine the need for chiropractic care and the need for referral to other providers. These competencies are required of all graduates of chiropractic institutions. To become a licensed chiropractic physician in the state of Washington, one must have graduated from an approved and accredited chiropractic college and all graduates of chiropractic colleges accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education must demonstrate competencies in a variety of areas including those domains of patient evaluation that are required for PPEs and DOT physicals. Those re quired competencies sp ecifically include, among others, I'll name a few: compiling a case appropriated history of any present illness, a systems review and review of past family and psychosocial history for the purpose of clinical decision making, perform case appropriate physical examinations that include evaluations of body regions and organ systems that assist the cl inician in developing a clinical diagnosis, utilization of diagnostic studies and consultations including the (inaudible) and clinical laboratory and forming diagnoses supported by information gathered from the history, examination and diagnostic studies, establishing a management plan appropriate for the diagnosis and determining the need for emergency care and referral as well as collaborative care. Chiropractic physicians having been trained to perform and having demonstrated competency in those general areas that are required for PPEs and DOT physicals are really eminently qualified to perform those screening examinations and thes e are, in fact, screening examinations. They are not for the purpose of treatment and management of any abnormality that one may find on these screening exams. As you have heard today, these screening exams, by their nature, will not have the capacity to pick up all abnormalities or prevent any potential future problems. They do have the capacity to reduce those numbers of issues that happen either on the field or during driving events. Therefore, I fully support the proposed clarification of the scope of practice for chiropractic physicians in the state of Washington. I would like to address a couple of the issues made about increased costs and access. Certainly, expanding or clarifying the chiropractic scope to include these examinations w ill, in fact, improve access for certain patients that primarily do see a chiropractic physician and don't necessarily have the access to see other medical physicians or healthcare providers. I fail to see the link between expanding chiropractic scope to include these, or clarifying chiropractic scope to include these examinations and increased costs. Generally, chiropractic services are provided at a lower cost than similar other services provided by medical providers and there is likely a cost savings to providing these services through chiropractic physicians. These ar e not duplicative services. They are actually replacement services and will thereby increase access and reduce costs. I want to clarify an Chiropractic Sunrise 150earlier comment that I heard about the assumption that allowing chiropractors to perform these actually increases access but at an increased risk. I'm not aware of any evidence at all to suggest that having chiropractors perform these ty pes of examinations, which they do in many jurisdictions around the US, actually increase the likelihood or propensity of adverse outcomes as the result of these examinations and screenings. I'm certainly happy to answer any questions and I appreciate the opportunity. KRISTI WEEKS: Do you have any questions? Thank you. According to the sign-in sheet, we have now had everyone testify who wanted to testify. Did I miss anybody who wanted to testify? OK. Would the proponents like a brief rebuttal? LORI GRASSI: We can do that in writing. KRISTI WEEKS: Thank you. Speaking of writing, fo r those of you brought your testimony today and were reading from testimony, if you could provide us with a copy, we would love to have it if you are comfortable with that. Otherwise, we hope the recorders picked it all up. Thank you for taking part in this public hearing. Here are the next steps in the process: There is an additional 10-day written comment period starting today through August 16th at 5:00pm for anything you feel has not been addressed. We will share an initial draft report with interested parties in September for rebuttal comments. Those of you participating today will receive the draft as long as we have contact information for you. We will incorporate rebuttal comments into the report and submit it to the Secretary of the Department of Health for approval in October. Once the Secretary approves the report, it is submitted to the Office of Financial Management for approval to be released to the legislature. OFM provides policy and fiscal support to the Governor, legislature, and state agencies. It will be released to the legislature prior to the legislative session in 2014, and will be posted to our Web site once the legislature receives it. That is all and thank you. Chiropractic Sunrise 151 Chiropractic Sunrise 152 Appendix E Written Comments Chiropractic Sunrise 153 Chiropractic Sunrise 154Chiropractic Scope of Practice Sunrise Written Comments Received Doug Attig I would like to strongly object to chiropractors performing sports physicals. They have no training outside the musculosk eletal system, and any \"additional qualifications\" they claim to have are obtained under the auspices of other chiropractors, are not evidence-based, and the educational requirements are inadequate. They will miss heart pr oblems, diabetes, systemic disease, developmental problems and many, many others. I have similar objections to their performing CDL exams. They have no training to pick up on diabetes, heart disease or many other disqualifying conditions. Again, many chiropractors claim \"advanced qualifications\", but have obtained these from other chiropractors who are similarly under-trained. The State has recently added burdensome requirements to MD's in order to do CDL exams. I have stopped doing them because I do not have the time to comply, though I am trained, and have done them for many years. If my MD training is inadequate, I would submit that any chiropractor's is as well. Allowing the Board of Chiropractic to maintain that they are qualified to do these exams is ludicrous. To add these things to chiropractic practice would degrade quality of care, and both proposals should be dismissed outright. Doug Groenig I do not feel that the chiropractic scope of practice should include physical exams for commercial drivers nor for sports physicals ..... UNLESS doctors of physical therapy are also allowed to perform them. Marc Van Driessche D.C., C.C.E.P., C.V.C.P This is in reference to the email which I received regarding the public hearing being held on August 6th, 2013 on the scope of practice change for Chiropractors to include sport physicals for junior high and high school students (which are under the WIAA regulations) and commercial driver license physicals. As you may be aware I have been a strong advocate for Chiropractors to be allowed to perform sport physicals and department of health examinations. Unfortunately, it has taken over 15 years of hard work by many people to finally see this brought forward. I have written hundreds of pages regarding this topic (which can be supplied to you by request) I have addressed this issue with the WIAA, Washington State Board of Health, Washington Chiropractic Association, and Washington Quality Assurance Commission multiple times. I feel it has been an oversight on the way the RCW code was written so that certain groups could use this as a loop hole to exclude Chiropractors from performing these tasks that are well within the scope of practice and our Chiropractic Sunrise 155educational standards. Unfortunately, I cannot be there in person to testify on this matter. I have given the Washington St ate Chiropractic Association all of my research and communication with each of the above groups. It is my hope that this oversight can be corrected so that future groups cannot use these loop holes to discriminate against Chiropractors performing these tasks. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Washington State Chiropractic Association for bringing this topic up for resolution. I hope the State Board of Health and the Quality Assurance Commission both realize how much of a problem this has caused the Washington State Chiropractic profession and the doctors that deal with these specific groups on a regular basis. It is my hope that by opening this practice act thes e issues will be resolved and that the Chiropractic profession and, specifically those doctors that deal with this on a regular basis, will not be discriminated any further; as I truly believe that the level of care that Chiropractors provide is beyond reproach. If I can be of any further assistance in this matter it would be my pleasure to help in any way possible; to assure that this injustice is corrected. Tri-Cities Community Health Signed by Jennifer Robinson, RN, BSN, MBA Tri-Cities Community Health Center, a federally qualified health center, believes that sports physicals should be completed by a medical doctor or medical clinician. Medical providers have the training, medical skills, background and experience to obtain a deta iled family history of heart disease, perform the physical exam and recognize heart disease. These exams are often the only visit a child or teenager may have with their provider annually. This time affords the medical provider a chance to give the child a thorough physical exam and address important questions, especially with teenagers, including adolescent issues of drinking, smoking, dr ugs, sexual activity and depression. It is also a time to verify that the child is up-to-date with immunizations such as the most recent tetanus, the hepatitis B series, the chickenpox vaccine, and the measles immunization. These are not areas of expertise for a Chiropractor and are not services that a Chiropractor can deliver. The sports form is not just a piece of paper to be filled out and signed for sake of compliance for a child to participate in sports. It's successfully completed when appropriately addressing the whole patient, not solely a patient's physical well-being. The ideal examiner is the child's pe rsonal medical provider who already knows the child's health history and family history in depth. A family physician and/or pediatrician have the broad training to pick up potential problems in all areas that a Chiropractor doesn't have. A student may have an obvious chiropractic condition requiring an excu se from sports, however, this is very different from the comprehensive physical exam required to certify that a student is fit to participate in strenuous school athletic activities. Chiropractic Sunrise 156Family Practice physicians and clinicians are qualified to complete these exams. Chiropractors and other alternative providers are not, even with special certification and training. physical exam required to certify that a student is fit to participate in strenuous school athletic activities. Family Practice physicians and clinicians are qualified to complete these exams. Chiropractors and other alternative providers are not, even with special certification and training Nicholas Harrison PA-C A.T.,C Physician Assistant. I am writing in response to the legislatures call for the DOH to review the chiropractors request to perform sports physicals and CDL physical exams. I find it worrisome that chiropractors are attempting permission to provide a service of performing these especially important exams for our young athletes and heavy equipment operators. It is inappropriate for someone of their educational background and clinical knowledge to be providing such delicate services. History and Physical exams fo r these two populations are more than just musculoskeletal exams. Medical history alone requires knowledge of several disease processes and medication management. Chiropractors do not possess prescription authority in their scope of practice, and many disease processes are outside of their clinical realm. For example hypertension, cardiomyopathies, depression, anxiety, and diabetes management are not in the chiropractors scope of practice. These conditions need to be identified during these physicals. The physical exam is also important in these populations. Chiropractors do not have the clinical knowledge to perform complete physical exams that include systems such as cardiopulmonary, genitourinary and HEENT. Every year we have athlete deaths related to cardiac history. Preventing these deaths is of utmost concern & priority. It is in our best interest that this measure does not pass as our young athletes and heavy equipment operators health and livelihoods are at stake. Central Washington University Athletic Training Staff Kari Gage, ATC, AT/L Charity McCright, ATC, AT/L Shea Gembol, As members of the National Athletic Trainers' Association and Certified/Licensed Athletic Trainers in the State of Washington we would like to express our concern about the following pr oposal to change the scope of practice for chiropractors to include the ability to perform physical examinations for sports physicals. Having worked in the athletic setting a nd with student-athletes for the last 11 years, we have been though countless pre-participation physicals and dealt with many injuries and illnesses. The pre-participating physical is an important aspect in ensuring our student-athletes are health y and safe with concerns of orthopedic injuries, cardiovascular abnormalities, neurological, metabolic, psychological concerns and sickle cell trait. As a me mber of an NCAA sponsored institution it Chiropractic Sunrise 157is a requirement for our student-athlet es to have yearly exams by our team physician. It is also a requirement that incoming student-athletes have a pre- participation physical in the last six mont hs performed by a physician. Below is the current bylaw that we have to adhere to: NCAA Division II Manual By Law 17.1.5 Mandatory Medical Examination. Pr ior to participation in any practice, competition or out of- season conditioning activities (or, in Division I, permissible voluntary summer conditioning in basketball and football or voluntary individual workouts pursuant to the safety exception), student-athletes who are beginning their initial season of eligibility and students who are trying out for a team shall be required to undergo a medical examination or evaluation administered or supervised by a physician (e.g., family physician, team physician). The examination or evaluation must be administered within six months prior to participation in an y practice, competition or out-of-season conditioning activities. In following years, an updated history of the student-athlete's medical condition shall be administered by an institutional medical staff member (e.g., sports medicine staff, te am physician) to determine if additional examinations (e.g., physical, cardiov ascular, neurological) are required. The updated history must be administered within six months prior to the student- athlete's participation in any practice, competition or out-of-season c onditioning activities for the applicable academic 8/1/07, Revised: 5/23/08) 17.1.5.1 Sickle Cell Solubility Test. The examination or evaluation of student- athletes who are beginning their initial s eason of eligibility and students who are trying out for a team shall include a sickle cell solubility test (SST), unless documented results of a prior test are provided to the institution or the student-athlete declines the test and signs a written release. (Adopted: 1/14/12 effective 8/1/12) Our concerns as health care providers are a chiropractor's inability to have access to medical diagnostic tools in order to diagnosis certain health care concerns that can appear in a physical examination like cardiovascular abnormalities, metabolic, or blood issues th at might be a determining factor to limit participation. Another major concern is history of concussions. A chiropractor is not a concussion specialist and there are concerns that this would come up in a pre- participation physical where an athlete should not be cleared to participate. A physician that performs pre-participation physicals needs to have a comprehensive understanding about all health issues that would either limit or exclude an athlete from participating. We do appreciate and use chiropractic serv ices quite often. We believe they can play an intricate part in returning an at hlete to play after an injury. However, there are just too many issue outside of neuromuscular and musculoskeletal Chiropractic Sunrise 158injures that could arise and therefore be missed during a pre-participation exam that are not in the scope of practice for a chiropractor. This is a major concern when looking at the health and safety of young athletes. Scope of practice for Chiropractic In 2005 the WHO published a document, WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic Chiropractic is licensed and regulated in every State (Lamm, 1995). State statutes and regulations determine the scope of clinical procedures chiropractors may legally perform in their respective jurisdictions. Providing care for musculoskeletal conditions using manipulation as a primary intervention is within the legal scope of chiropractic prac tice in all 50 States. The legal right to use other procedures including modalities, myofascial work, acupuncture, and nutritional therapy varies from State to State. All States currently exclude prescribing drugs and performing major su rgery from chiropractic practice. Thank you for your time and consideration. Gary Schultz, DC, DACBR Professor and Chair, Department of Clinical Sciences College of Chiropractic University of Western States On behalf of president Brimhall, I would like to submit the attached written comments for consideration in the chiropractic scope of practice Sunrise Hearing which is slated to occur on August 6, 2013. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me, Attachments: NBCE Written Examinations, National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, Fall 2013 The Council on Chiropractic Education, CCE Accreditatin STandards Marla Kaufman, M.D. I am writing to express strong concern about the Proposal to Change Chiropractor Scope of Practice, which proposes allowing chiropractors to perform sports physicals and driver's license examinations. My concern is that chiropractors are NOT trained in providing comprehensive medical services, including cardiovascular and other internal medical conditions, that are, in fact, often the most critical component of th ese evaluations. The musculoskeletal portion of these examinations, while important, are only a portion of these physicals. Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in exercising young athletes. There has been extensive medical work done on preventing sudden cardiac death in young athletes that is based on trained evaluation of the history and physical examination. There is also a growing recognition of the critical importance of assessing for prio r head injuries and concussions in a highly structured and rigorous process, and the importance of proper evaluation and management of traumatic brain injuries is underscored by the number of investigations and lawsuits now coming out regarding recurrent football injuries Chiropractic Sunrise 159starting as early as grade school and high school. I support multi-disciplinary approaches to health care, and believe in all specialties practicing the full scope of WHAT THEY ARE TRAINED TO DO COMPETENTLY. This does NOT extend to chiropracters providing medical services without a medical license. Please let me know if I can provide any more background or information about these concerns . Stan Herring, M.D. I would like to correspond with y ou in regard to th e notice of Sunrise Review and Public Hearing - Prop osal to Ch ange Ch iropractic Sc ope of Practice . I have reviewed the Sunr ise webpage to se e th e proposal an d the addi tional in formation related to th is p roposal, including t he educational coursework and c ompetency testing which is suggested for a doctor of ch iropractic to pass in order to perform a pre-participation examination and make clearance decisions to participate in sport. I am writing to express my strong concerns about changing the scope of practice to allow chiropractors to p erform pre-particip ation physical examinations for sp orting activity. I hav e been involved in th e practice of sp orts medicine for three d ecades. I am a professor at the University of Washington where I serve as Director of Sports Spine & Orthopedic Health for UW Medicine, and I am a t eam physician for the Seattle Seahawks and the Seattle Mariners, as well as a consultant to the Seattle Storm. I am a member of the NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee, and I chair the Clinical Sports Me dicine Leadership C ommittee f or t he American Colle ge of Sports Medicine. I have also served as a board member of the American College of Sports Medicine, and I am a founding member of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine. I h ave published peer-reviewed articles, edited textbooks, and served on editorial review boards for journals regarding sports medicine issues. My clinical practice h as been d evoted to the c are of a ctive pe ople and athletes with spo rts medicine-related injuries. My exp erience in sports medicine h as al lowed me to work w ith a v ariety of different practition ers, in cluding many of my chir opractic colleagues f or whom I have mu ch r espect. I have enjoyed those wo rking r elationships a s they r elate to certain injuries in sport; however, I do not believe that chiropractors are trained and have t he experience t o assess a ll o f t he c omprehensive medical, m usculoskeletal and neurological conditions that are an essential part of a pre-participation physical examination. The proposed educational requirements are insufficient and are not a substitute for clinical training and experience particularly for such issues as cardiac screening, sickle cell disease, exercise induced bronchospasm, concussion, absence of a p aired organ, seizure disorder, ligamentous in jury to the kn ee, an d Chiropractic Sunrise 160multidirectional shou lder in stability to name on ly a few of the areas th at must b e addressed as part of any pre-participation physical examination. I have s pent m y career trea ting patie nts as well as advocating for the health and safety of y oung athletes. I will continue to enjoy th e in teractions I have with different healthcare professionals; however, pre-participation physical examinations are an a rea t hat sh ould not be in cluded in the s cope of chiropractic c are. Such a decision would pu t o ur y oung athletes at undue risk fo r p otentially catastroph ic and/or d isabling co nsequences, and i t is my p ersonal opin ion that this up coming Sunrise Review on Au gust 6, 2013, shou ld not approve the proposal to ch ange the scope of practice for chiropractors to include the performance of pre-participation physical examinations for sports physicals. Thank you for your considerat ion, and please feel free to contact me if I can provide any further information. Jonathan Drezner, MD I am writing to express my strong concern about the Chiropractic Scope of Practice Sunrise Review previously reviewed during the 2013 legislative session as HB 1573. This proposal would allow chiropractors to perform sports physicals and driver's license examinations. ~As immediate Past-President of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, medical team physician for the Seattle Seahawks, and Director of the Center for Sports Cardiology at the University of Washington, this proposal is antithetical to continued efforts in the medical community to improve athlete safety on the playing field. Chiropractors are NOT trained in providing comprehensive medical services, including cardiovascular and other internal medical conditions, that are in fact the most critical component of these pre-participation evaluations. ~The musculoskeletal portion of these examinations, while important, is only a portion of these physicals. ~ Sudden cardiac death from an underlying heart condition is the leading cause of death in exercising young athletes.~ There has been extensive medical work done on preventing sudden cardiac death in young athletes that is based on trained evaluation of the history and physical examination, proper use of non-invasive cardiovascular testing, and a solid understanding of the conditions associated with sudden cardiac death in young athletes. ~There is also a growing recognition of the critical importance of assessing for prior head injuries and concussions in a highly structured a nd rigorous process - the importance of which is underscored by the number of i nvestigations and lawsuits now coming out regarding recurrent football injuries starting as early as grade school and high school.~ I support multi-disciplinary approaches to health care, and believe in all Chiropractic Sunrise 161specialties practicing the full scope of WHAT THEY ARE TRAINED TO DO COMPETENTLY. ~Chiropractors are simply NOT trained or competent to conduct a medical sports physical. I would never endorse a child receiving \"heart clearance\" from a chiropractor, no more than I would support someone piloting a commercial jet just because they've taken a simulator class. The assertion that chiropractors can appropriately evaluate medical conditions, especially ones that place athletes at ri sk for sudden death or catastrophic outcomes, is both absurd and dangerous. I urge you to oppose this Chiropractic Scope of Practice Sunrise Review (HB 1573). Please contact me if I can be of any help or provide more information. Jana Wiley, R.N., M.S. East Asian Medicine Practitioner I have been a registered nurse /acupunturist for over two decades. After reading the proposal to expand the scope of practice for chiropractors, I did a double take. Please, it would be to everyone's advantage to stay within their own scope of practice for patient safety. I agree with the position of the WA State AMA entirely, which strongly emphasized safety concerns and lack of adequate training. The comparison charts embedded within their comment letter highlight the inadequacy of the chiropractic colleges to prepare their stude nts for comprehensive physical exams, which go beyond the musculoskelatal system . A lack of CLINICAL training in cardiac pathologies and concussion evalua tion would be devastating to a young athlete. For example, to work with cardiac patients in a busy hospital setting, I had 320 hours of extra training and a one year mentoring program on the cardiac floor. Neurology is a whole separate field. Inversely, I would not recommend that M.Ds, P.A.s or ARNPs perform chiropractic manipulations. Ditto fo r people who are not academically and clinically trained in acupuncture who want to insert acupuncture needles into their patients. I think we need to stay within our training, which is reflected in our legal scope of practice. Douglas L. Daniels M.Ac., Dipl.Ac. (NCCAOM) East Asian Medicine Practitioner I oppose the expansion of the current Chir opractic Scope of Practice proposed in H.B. 1573. Chiropractic didactic and clin ical training falls far short of teaching skill sets necessary to perform these ex tra procedures with competence and safety, especially regarding the ability to diagnose simple or complex patterns of disease and injury. Many potentially ser ious problems may be overlooked in athletes and drivers, simply due to the lack of knowledge, training and experience of the Chiropractic Doctor. As with any other modality of allopath ic or alternative medicine, adequate professional training should dictate what procedures are allowed in a scope of practice. While attending seminars, lectures and taking courses by correspondence are superficially beneficial to medical practice, nothing replaces intensive didactic and hands on clinical experience in the learning process, to be fully competent in performing a procedure. Chiropractic Sunrise 162Kelly Golob D.C. I am submitting these written comments about the Chiropractic Scope of Practice Sunrise Review (HB 1573). I am in favor of allowing Chiropractic physicians to perform physical ex aminations for sport's physicals and commercial driver's licenses. Chiropractic physicians are thoroughly trained in physical examination and differential diagnosis. Although many of us choose to focus our clinical practices on the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries, we perform detailed medical history taking and physical examinations daily in our offices, and it is our responsibility to rule out and make proper referrals when necessary for any medical condition that a patient may present with. Also, pre-participation physicals are part of our training in chiropractic schools, and during my time as a chiropractic student in California (where pre- particpation physicals are included in the scope of every chiropractor, regardless of advanced post-graduate training) I he lped perform hundreds of sports physical for high school students under the supervis ion of licensed chiropractors. During these physicals we carefully assessed each athletes overall health and screened for any potential risk factors (includi ng heart disease, lung disease, orthopedic issues, and more...) that might prevent them from safely participating in their sport. Many of the written objections to this legislation that I have read appear anything but objective. Most of these objec tions seem to be written by those very unaware of the actual clinical training th at Chiropractic physicians receive, and their opinions are based on anecdotal personal experiences at best. Most of the critics of this legislation would have us believe that there would be more serious athletic injuries if chiropr actors were allowed to perform sports physicals, however this privilege has already been allowed in the scope of Chiropractic Physicians for many years in dozens of other states and I have not read any peer-reviewed research that demonstrates these states have suffered because of it. Also, these critics ignore that fact that Chiropractic Physicians care for our nation's most elite athletes. Many of our Olympic teams travel to their international events with a treating Ch iropractor as their attending physician responsible for clearing them to return to play after every injury, including concussions. While many opponents of Chiropractic Ph ysicians will resort to hearsay and scare tactics to justify their objection to this legislation, it is my professional opinion, based on personal experience and the available research, that allowing Chiropractic Physicians to perform spor ts physicals and commercial driver's license physicals in the state of Washington would be a benefit to our patients Chiropractic Sunrise 163and the entire health-care system. Lorri Nichols DC, CCEP On August 6, 2013 I had the opportunity to attend the Department of Health Sunrise Review hearing regarding Doctors of Chiropractic's ability to perform Department of Transportation \"Fit for Duty\" Physical Exams and Pre-Participation Sports Physicals. I would first like to thank the panel members for the opportunity to present our information. It was clear that each panel member had a sincere desire to thoroughly understand the information presented to them and I appreciate both their time and efforts. I fully support the testimony of Dr. Gary Schultz, Dr. Robert Nelson, Dr. Jason Passey, and Ms. Lori Grassi. These individuals thoroughly and accurately presented chiropractic education, clinical expertise and chiropractic practice detailing the components of the DOT and PPE examination that are taught in the college core curriculum of a Doctor of Chiropractic. Dr. Shultz and Nelson further discussed the additional training in the CCEP, DACBSP and course outlined by the DOT for all participating providers. It is terribly disappointing to observe the testimony of Mr. Carl Nelson of the WSMA, athletic director Mr. O'Leary and Ms. Darla Varretti. The testimony presented by these individual was clearly inaccurate, emotional and bias. Additionally, Mr. O'Leary also misrep resented and inaccurately represented Dr. Nelson's testimony which is particularly shocking since he is not a physician of any specialty nor in the position to give an informed opinion in this matter. The core curriculum of the Doctor of Chiropractic clearly contains the component necessary to perform these S CREENING examinations. DCs do not claim to be neurologist or cardiologist; however our training does clearly prepare us to screen both athletes and commercial drivers for their ability to perform their duties and/or make referrals when any abnormalities are detected. As an additional measure, the WSCA is also proposing specific training programs for DCs interested in performing these exams as refresher courses and for added assurance. The DOT requires these courses for ALL physicians to perform these examinations; DC, MD and DO. I am a Doctor of Chiropractic licensed in Washington with 30 years of clinical experience. I have additional national cer tifications in extremity work (CCEP) and am Board Eligible in Spinal Rehabilitation (DACRB). I have served 8 years on the Department of Health Quality Assurance Commission, and as President of the Washington State Chiropractic Associa tion. I currently remain a WSCA Board member. As such I would respect fully ask the panel to objectively and thoroughly study the information submitted by both sides of the argument and Chiropractic Sunrise 164come to the only logical, factual conclusion. Ben McCay, DC After reading through the other comments posted regarding chiropractors performing PPEs, it is obvious that many health care providers know little about the chiropractic education process. Perf orming PPEs (including cardiac exams) are certainly well-within the educational curriculum taught at chiropractic colleges. Chiropractors are well-trained in the clinical knowledge to perform complete physical exams that include systems such as cardiopulmonary, genitourinary, and EENT. The knowledge and skill to perform such examinations is a prerequisite to passing both the core curriculum of any DC program and the national board exams (especially part III). It is simple ignorance to assert otherwise. With that said, it is also true that chiropractors might forget the necessary components to a cardiac evaluation after not performing one in years. And the same is true for medical doctors who don't routinely ascultate hearts. But the incompetent MD doesn't lower the practi ce standards of the medical profession, and neither should the incompetent DC. Ou r scope of practice should include the examinations we were trained to perform. Murray L. Smith, D.C. Tumwater, Washington Please accept my written comments for support of HB1573. The written statements I've read to date have pe rsuaded me to exercise my prerogative to provide comments in favor of allowing Chiropractic Physicians to perform physical examinations for sports phys icals and commercial driver's licenses. Chiropractic Physicians are thoroughly trained to perform these physicals. Dr. Joseph Brimhall, D.C., President of the University of Western States, affirms the facts in his letter regarding our educatio n. Old data on Chiropractic education that may be referenced to dissuade accep tance of HB 1573 should be held null. As he has confirmed, the training to perform a thorough history and examination with the scientific training more than adequately establishes a Chiropractic Physician's ability to carry out these phys icals. Hearsay and personal belief should carry no weight in such an important process. Washington State is one of the few remaining states restricting Chiropractic Physicians from performing these physicals. In the upcoming years the face of healthcare may dramatically change. A ve ry real shortage of portal of entry providers to perform patient evaluation and management seems eminent. As a progressive state, Washington owes its residents access to all physicians competent to perform duties they are tr ained to carry out. To not allow competent Chiropractic Physicians to perform these physicals is a disservice to Washington residents. Dr. Marc Y Van I have read through the 44 pages of written comments sent in on HB 1573. There seems to be a vast misunderstanding about Chiropractic education, Chiropractic Sunrise 165Driessche D.C., C.C.E.P, C.V.C.P Board Eligible in Sports Medicine C.C.S.P. diagnostic ability, and didactic training. Many of the doctors of medicine that wrote in are misinformed as to the issue that is now before the department of health. The way RCW code 18.25.005 is written allows for a loop hole to exist where certain groups manage to use that loop hole to exclude Chiropractors from performing physical examination without performing Chiropractic care. I believe that this is a politically charged and emotionally sensitive topic and comes down to a public safety issue. Will a Chiropractor cause injury by performing a physical examination on a high school or junior high athlete and/or a department of licensing exam? The answer to this question is emphatically NO! A Chiropractors education far surpasses the current requirements for performing a high school or junior high and/or department of licensing exam. The problem has originated from the RCW code 28A.58.125 which was enacted in 1976 to authorize the WIAA to control high school and junior high athletes. The fact of the matter is that doctors of Chiropractic meet and surpass the educational and training requirements to fulfill any and all of the physical examination findings for high school and j unior high and department of licensing exams. Groups like the WIAA have co nstantly discriminated against the Chiropractic profession using the loop hole found in RCW code 18.25.005. I contacted Mr. Olson who at the time, was the lawyer for the WIAA, and he stated to me that the problem was never a Chiropractor's education or abilities to do a physical examination but rather the way the RCW code was being interpreted, by fixing this we would truly alleviate a huge discrimination of groups against health care providers that have been performing these exams for years without any problems. As with a ny physical examination done by any primary health care provider if an abnormality is found during physical examination if a referral is warranted to complete the examination then the patient is referred to a specialist. This does not change if the Chiropractor is doing the examination. I do not believe Chiropractors in the State of Washington should be used as a doormat for any other health care provider and I find it truly insulting that another doctor who has not investigated my credentials or experience in striving to be the best at what I do tries to dictate and make up stories about my education and/or experience. As a matter of public safety I strongly urge the department of health to look past the emotionally charged comments of doctors whom are simply uninformed, uneducated, and bias towards their specific organization. While reading the 44 pages of comments, I have found many medical doctors whom I have worked with in the past. It saddens me that my expertise in sports and physical examination was okay for them to use for 20 years but now when clarification of my abilities has come to light through a sunrise act they look to limit my abilities to help an athlet e or perform a department of licensing exam. I have constantly improved my education standards by studying concussions and sports medicine to im prove my understanding of current health Chiropractic Sunrise 166care issues. I am nationally board certified in concussions by the ACSM Certificate no. 69420. I am also currently board eligible for the certified Chiropractic sports physician program. I be lieve all physicians regardless of their degree strive to increase their educational standards in order to be proficient at their diagnostic and didactic skills. I hope the Department of Health can see past the emotionally charged comments that hold no factual evidence and rather look at the education standards and the requirements to do a high school and junior high and department of licensing physical exam. I believe the most factual evidence in the written comments was given to you on behalf of Western State University written by Dr. Joseph Brimhall. In Dr. Brimhall's statement are all of the defi nitions and requirements that could possibly be needed to prove that Chiropr actors in the state of Washington are both capable and meet the educational requirements necessary to perform sports physicals at the high school and junior high as well a department of licensing exams. Dr. John Huynh My name is Dr. John Huynh, chiropractor in Bonney Lake Washington and going to be passing the Certified Chirop ractic Sports Physician program here shortly. I can attest that my training specifically outweighs most of the providers in providing adequate yet thorough care via examinations and sport physicals. I know many in other professions that do th e very minimal in examinations and physicals, yet with our training and education it surpasses others in which I am in favor of my profession being allowed to do physicals and on field work. Here in my town, I partner with Mutlicare sports clinic and we co treat patients from 5 year old to 90 year old athletes with one objective - their health. As you know, many in other professions oppose, not because of our qualifications, but deep false assumptions about my profession which cannot be upheld to this degree in today's society. Many patients would prefer a certified sports chiropractor to do their physicals than a regular physician or athletic trainer b/c 1. we know their history. 2. they trust us. 3. we have helped them in their previous conditions. 4. they have full confidence in our abilities. 5. our training and expertise is well rounded and proven. 6. many states in our country already have this capability for their Ch iropractors, yet Washington is lagging behind. I hope this will help in advancing Chiropractic profession thru the state of Washington for the treatments used is already in professional sports teams, Olympic teams, and throughout college and high school teams across America. Lyle E Ronning DC I am writing in support of the sunrise revi ew application proposing to change the scope of practice for licensed chiropractors to include the performance of Chiropractic Sunrise 167 physical examinations for sports phys icals and commercial driver's licenses. Chiropractors have been excluded from performing these types of examinations in the past due to the particular wording of our scope of practice. The particular wording limits our physical examinations to determining the appropriateness of chiropractic care or the need for referral to other healthcare providers. This oversight simultaneously limits chir opractic evaluation and treatment to musculoskeletal conditions while at the same time makes us responsible for examining all other body systems so appropriate referral may take place as necessary. To this end, chiropractors ar e well-trained and compelled (due to liability issues) to complete full examin ations such as the ones currently in question as explained in the letter from Western States Chiropractic College by Dr. Joseph Brimhall. I have reviewed the details of the procedures necessary for these two examinations and see nothing outside the normal scope of examinations performed in chiropractic offices every day throughout the state of Washington as well as in my own practice. It saddens me to read the responses from other healthcare providers in our state which s how the ignorance that exists regarding the general level of training and responsibility of chiropractic physicians. Chiropractic colleges train their students to enable them to practice competently in any state. I am a graduate of Western States Chiropractic College in Oregon where the scope of practice includes minor surgery, obstetrics, gynecology, and genitourinary procedures. Just because our practi ce has been limited in this state by oversights in legal wording does not mean that the practitioners are not sufficiently trained and capable of performing these examinations in a professional manner with due regard for public safety. Bryson J. Langel, DC Chiropractic offers a unique service that is separate and distinct from any other health profession; it is not part of the practice of medicine (alternative or mainstream). The purpose of Chiropractic is to locate, analy ze and correct the Vertebral Su bluxation Com plex (VSC ) b ecause it interferes w ith the proper function of the nervous system and disrupt s one's ability to experience a sense of well-being. When Chiropractors exa mine the skeletal and nervous sy stems they do so with the focus on how the VSC is affecting one's health - this service is unique to the Chiropractic profession. Some of the phy sical, orthopedic and neurological tests used by Chiropractors ma y resemble those used by medical doctors but it is not the intent of Chiropractors to practice medicine. Because sports phy sicals are perfor med to assess a person' s medical heal th Chiropractic Sunrise 168status, which is different from their chir opractic health status, they should solely remain the p rofessional r esponsibility of medical p ractitioners ( MD, DO, P A, NP). Khai Lam, DC Sutton Chiropractic and Massage I am writing you in support of chiropractic physicians performing sport and CDL physical examinations. After viewing the submitted responses thus far it is clear that there is a gross misunderstanding as to the education and abilities of a chiropractic physician. To suggest that chiropractic physicians perform anything less than a thorough and complete physical examination with a complete history, in compliance with the needs of sport and CDL physicals, is purely unfounded skepticism and clearly reflects a lack of knowledge and understanding of chiropractic schooling, credentialing and scope. Contrary to the belief of the uninformed, chiropractors are most definitely trained in complete physical exams including cardiopulmonary, genitourinary, and HEENT. Furthermore, the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners thoroughly tests on these matters as several other states allow these examinations to be performed by chiropractic physicians. A simple search into chiropractic education would reveal that chiropractic physicians have a dvanced schooling in organ and neuromusculoskeletal systems along with differential diagnostic and neurological assessment. I urge those unfamiliar with the chiropractic profession to have an informed opinion before discussing said \"limitations\" to the chiropractic profession. Chiropractic physicians have access to a ll medical diagnostic tools available to other healthcare providers, in that our scope allows for the ordering of advanced medical imaging, urinalysis, and blood work. The importance of neurological and cardiovascular health to pre -participation of sports is not lost on the chiropractic profession, and like all other health care fields, proper assessment and management is of grave importance. Thus any properly trained healthcare professional would refer to the services of a specialist when needed, but to assume a chiropractic physician is unable to recognize that importance is a baseless assumption. It is in my opinion that I and those in my field are completely competent in performing these examinations and I highly recommend a review of the chiropractic education be conducted to so lidify this. Thank you very much. Thomas R Hurst, DC Clinic Director Hurst Chiropractic, PC I wish to express my support for the proposal that chiropractors in this state be permitted to perform PPE and DOT exams. We already have the professional training to do these type exams, we do ex aminations routinely. It is proposed that those chiropractors that wish to pr ovide these specific exams will have some additional training required and protocols to follow. I am confident that my colleagues will do a fine job with this service for their patients. It feels very unfair and discriminatory to not allow our interested chiropractors the opportunity to acquire additional training and provide these examinations. Chiropractic Sunrise 169Paul Buehrens MD Lakeshore Clinic Totem Lake I am writing to express strong opposition to permitting chiropractors to perform DOT or sports participation physicals. They may be skilled in spinal manipulation, but their skill set as a profession is less than that of a PA or a nurse practitioner, and a chiropractor could not be trusted to detect a congenital heart defect that puts an athlete at risk, nor to assess and detect sleep apnea in a truck driver. Allowing chiropractors to ma ke these judgments will endanger certain individuals, and overall for the State of Washington, such a move will jeopardize the public health. I could elaborate at length on the missing skills required to protect patients from sports injuries and the public from unsafe drivers, but you get the point. Dr. Avery N. Martin Practicing Chiropractor since 1977 I would like to encourage a positive input on allowing Chiropractors to provide pre-participation examinations a nd DOT physicals. Before practicing in Washington state, I practiced in Alaska and performed this function in our clinic for years to the satisfaction of parents, businesses, the local schools and coaches. Many parents liked the extra testing that was performed in a Chiropractors office because of our training and expertise in structural and joint problems. I would hope that this issue could move beyond political issues and for the benefit of the public, that Chiropractors would be able to provide this service in the State of Washington. I hope the committee provides the positive input to keep this process moving. thank you in advance for accepting this public input. Dennis Marchiori, D.C., Ph.D. Chancellor, Palmer College of Chiropractic As chancellor of Palmer College of Chirop ractic, the first and largest chiropractic college, I'd like to extend my support to the efforts of my colleagues in the Washington State Chiropractic Association and the Association of Chiropractic Colleges to clarify the scope of practice for chiropractors in Washington, specifically regarding pre-participation ph ysical examinations and Department of Transportation \"Fit for Duty\" physical exams. I echo my colleague David O'Bryon's co mments regarding misinformation about the standards and curriculum for the Doctor of Chiropractic degree. It seems this misinformation has been perpetuated throughout the legislative process to clarify chiropractic scope of practice for these types of physical examinations. Chiropractors in general, and Palmer graduates specifically, are highly skilled in providing comprehensive health exam inations. The Palmer College of Chiropractic Doctor of Chiropractic program curriculum is a five-academic-year post-graduate program including 4,620 to tal contact hours of instruction. Of these contact hours, 570 are in diagnosis, 300 in radiology procedures and interpretation, and 945 in practical clini cal experience in the Palmer Chiropractic Clinic system. Palmer's curriculum produces professionals who are highly trained and experienced in assessment and diagnosis as well as clinical-reasoning skills -- Chiropractic Sunrise 170 and are eligible for licensure in all 50 states. Palmer's D.C. curriculum is accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education, the recognized accrediting body for the chiropractic profession. All three of our campuses are regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and are members of the North Central Association. Doctors of Chiropractic are included as eligible health care providers to provide physical examinations by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). In fact, two faculty clinicians at the Palmer Chiropractic Clinics in the Quad Cities (Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, and Moline and Rock Island, Ill.) are recognized by the DOT to provide \"Fit for Duty\" physical exams and have completed the coursework to sit for the upcoming national registry examination that will be required in 2014. The DOT physical is a comprehensive evaluation covering all systems of the body, including a comprehensive health history and review along with a urinalysis screening. All of these examination aspects are taught and tested as part of Palmer's Doctor of Chiroprac tic curriculum, in both the academic and clinical portion of the education. Palmer College of Chiropractic's main cam pus is located in Davenport, Iowa. All Iowa high school students participating in sports are required to obtain a pre- participation physical examination. All Iowa school districts in the Quad Cities approve pre-participation physical examina tions provided by chiropractors. Our two outpatient clinics in the Quad Cities offer sports physicals throughout the school year with a special push at the beginning of each school year, and have provided 1,555 of these physicals during the l ast three years. This year, after four weeks of a two-month program offering sports physicals to area students, our Quad-Cities clinics have provided more than 300 sports physicals. Many parents have commented that these pre-participation physical examinations are the most comprehensive their children have ever received. I urge you to consider all of these facts as you formulate your recommendation regarding the current proposed chiropractic scope of care legislation. The citizens of Washington deserve the opportunity to receive thorough physical examinations from licensed and qualified health care professionals, including chiropractors.

These are essentials to a functioning public health system. As the Governor -appointed representatives for the people of Washington in matters relating to patient safety and determining acceptable standards of medical care, the Medical Commission opposes the proposed scope of practice expansion for the chiropractic profession in Washington. Our colleague from Congressional Distr ict two, Dr. Warren Howe, provided his personal comments on this issue prior to the August 6, 2013 hearing. His comments are based on over forty years of practice in sports medicine and noted expertise in this area. After monitoring the aforementioned hearing and reviewing the written comments, the Medical Commission would like to fully support and reaffirm the comments of Dr. Howe and expand on several points. Training Considerations All professions listed in this section require a Bachelor of Science degree with specific requirements for chemistry, mathematics, and other areas of scientific focus. With this consideration in mind, the following discussion does not take the BS training time into account. Many comments relating to this issue revolve around tr aining time, to which the chiropractic association answers that the 4,200 clock hours of instruction is sufficient to perform the PPE and DOT exams. An Advance Practice Nurse receives a minimum of 1,300 clock hours after their BS in Nursing. By comparison, a masters level PA trained at Washington's MEDEX receives approximately 4,320 clock hours of instruction. A Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of O steopathy receives a minimum of 5,200 clock hours of instruction in medical school alone. In postgraduate clinical training settings, the minimum amount of training a Doctor of Osteopathy can receive before becoming eligible a full license is 2,088 clinical hours. In many situations, Doctors of Osteopathy will receive the same amount of training as a Doctor of Medicin e. A Doctor of Medicine will Chiropractic Sunrise 200receive 5,760 hours of postgraduate clinical training at minimum, which eclipses the core chiropractic training (4,200) and the Diplomate in Chiropractic Sports Medicine (200) clock hours. At nearly 11,000 hours of education and training time for DOs and MDs, the statement that Doctors of Chiropractic have enough training to perform the PPE or DOT exam lacks validity and understanding. The issue of contention is not possessing adequate training to perform the exam, but possessing and utilizing the training well enough to identify small indicators that represent a larger systemic problem. Those that are in favor of scope expansion have failed to successfully argue that training is suffic ient. Primary Care The reference materials make mention of t he patient interaction and case management skills developed in chiropractic training with examples ranging from 20 patient histories, 16 non -student exams, diagnosis, and lab interpretations. By comparison, a Family Practice trainee is required to conduct 1,650 patient visits, with 150 occurring in the first year. Additional requirements for Family Practice trainees mandate that they be patient scheduled for a minimum of 40 weeks per year and ensu re 24 hour access of provider to patients while in training. This prepares the trainee for the expectations of practice in the primary care setting . The Medical Commission has seen no evidence in the materials provided that chiropractors receive training e quivalent to existing standards of medical education or postgraduate medical training considered separately or combined. In no section of the materials provided were any references to care of those with disabilities, either in or out of the sports medicine setting. We must stress that these are just comparing minimum standards for Family Practice trainees, which is the quickest route to direct practice. Additional training is required for specialties such as Sports Medicine, Pediatrics, or Internal Medicine. Those that are in favor of scope expansion have failed to successfully argue that clinical experience is sufficient. The comments made by chiropractors during the testimony of August 6 indicate a fundamental misunderstanding relating to the concept of a primary care physician. Both individuals testifying pro and members of WSCA testified that chiropractors are the primary care providers for their patients. The Medical Commission believes that this is outside the scope of practice for a chiropractor. The absence of another provider does not mandate the chiropractor into the role of the primary care physician. The chiropractor is a specialist just as an ophthalmologist or podiatrist is a specialist. However, neither the ophthalmologist or podiatrist should b e considered a primary care physician due to training and, perhaps the most important issue, the function of primary care is not a part of their daily practice. The same is true of chiropractors in that they do not routinely operate in the role of a primar y care capacity. They do not possess the education and clinical training to do so and typically do not operate as part of a medical home. Public Health System The final points the Commission would like to make relate to the practice of medicine within our current and evolving system. As Washington moves forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the encouraged formation of Accountable Care Or ganizations and Patient Centered Medical Homes, we must look at this scope expansion within that framework. Too often, the PPE and DOT exam is relegated to a lowest common denominator, mass operation in noisy settings. Even the most qualified medical or os teopathic sports medicine specialist has difficulty performing these crucial exams in typical Chiropractic Sunrise 201settings. To allow chiropractors with their significantly reduced training to conduct these exams will move Washington further away from the concept of team based medicine, impose a practitioner into the process that does not perform essential functions of medicine on a regular basis, and has not received any of the postgraduate clinical training mandated for those who currently conduct these exams. Conclusions and Recommendations Washington is considered a national leader in many areas of medical regulation and practice. The representatives of WSCA stated that Washington is one of two states that do not allow chiropractors to conduct the DOT exam. The Medical Commi ssion views this as medically appropriate and would encourage the state to maintain this position. Under no circumstances should a chiropractor be authorized to conduct a PPE for someone with disabilities. Finally, the Washington State Medical Commission r ecommends that all PPEs be performed in a quiet setting by the primary care provider, whether that is a Doctor of Medicine , Doctor of Osteopathy , Advance Practice Nurse, or supervised P hysician Assistant -Certified . The Commission considers a team - based approach within a medical home model as ideal from the standpoints of patient safety, reduction in handoffs, facilitation of communication, and appropriate referrals. This model represents a robust and effective public health delivery system. The Commission is supportive of any effort to raise the standard of care for the PPE or DOT exam. Sincerely, Maryella E.

Chiropractic Sunrise 22649 CFR 391.41 Physical Qualifications for Drivers THE DRIVER'S ROLE Responsibilities, work schedules, physical and emotional demands, and lifestyles among commercial drivers vary by the type of driving that they do. Some of the main types of drivers include the following: turn around or short relay (drivers return to th eir home base each evening); long relay (drivers drive 9 -11 hours and then have at least a 10 -hour off - duty period), straight through haul (cross country drivers); and team drivers (drivers share the driving by alternating their 5-hour driving periods and 5-hour rest periods.) The following factors may be involved in a driver's performance of duties: abrupt schedule changes and rotating work schedule s, which may result in irregular sleep patterns and a driver beginning a trip in a fatigued condition; lo ng hours; extended time away from family and friends, which may result in lack of social support; tight pickup and delivery schedules, with irregularity in work, rest, and eating patterns, adverse road, weather and traffic conditions, which may cause delay s and lead to hurriedly loading or unloading cargo in order to compensate for the lost time; and environmental conditions such as excessive vibration, noise, and extremes in temperature. Transporting passengers or hazardous materials may add to the demands on the commercial driver. There may be duties in addition to the driving task for which a driver is responsible and needs to be fit. Some of these resp onsibilities are: coupling and uncoupling trailer(s) from the tractor, loading and unloading trailer (s) (sometimes a driver may lift a heavy load or unload as much as 50,000 lbs. of freight after sitting for a long period of time without any stretching period); inspecting the operating condition of tractor and/or trailer(s) before, during and after deliv ery of cargo; lifting, installing, and removing heavy tire chains; and, lifting heavy tarpaulins to cover open top trailers. The above tasks demand agility, the ability to bend and stoop, the abili ty to maintain a crouching position to inspect the undersid e of the vehicle, frequent entering and exiting of the cab, and the ability to climb ladders on the tractor and/or trailer(s). In addition, a driver must have the perceptual skills to monitor a sometimes complex driving situation, the judgment skills t o make quick decisions, when necessary, and the manipulative skills to control an oversize steering wheel, shift gears using a manual transmission, and maneuver a vehicle in crowded areas. _____________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________ \u00a7391.41 PHYSICAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR DRIVERS (a) A person shall not drive a commercial motor vehicle unless he is physically qualified to do so and, except as provided in \u00a7391.67, has on his person the original, or a photographic copy, of a medical examiner's certificate that he is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle.

(13) Has no current clinical diagnosis of alcoholism. Chiropractic Sunrise 227 INSTRUCTIONS TO THE MEDICAL EXAMINER General Information The purpose of this examination is to determine a driver's physical qualification to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) in interstate commerce according to the requirements in 49 CFR 391.41-49. Therefore, the medical examiner must be knowledgeable of these requirements and guidelines developed by the FMCSA to assist the medical examiner in making the qualification determination. The medical examiner should be familiar with the driver's responsibilities and work environment and is referred to the section on the form, The Driver's Role . In addition to reviewing the Health History section with the driver and conducting the physical examination, the medical examiner should discuss common prescriptions and over-the-counter medications relative to the sideeffects and hazards of these medications while driving. Educate the driver to read warning labels on all medications. History of certain conditions maybe cause for rejection, particularly if required by regulation, or may indicate the need for additional laboratory tests or more stringent examination perhaps by a medical specialist. These decisions are usually made by the medical examiner in light of the driver's job responsibilities, work schedule and potential for the conditions to render the driver unsafe. Medical conditions should be recorded even if they are not cause for denial, and they should be discussed with the driver to encourage appropriate remedial care. This advice is especially needed when a condition, if neglected, could develop into a serious illness that could affect driving. If the medical examiner determines that the driver is fit to drive and is also able to perform non-driving responsibilities as may be required, the medical examiner signs the medical certificate which the driver must carry with his/her license. The certificate must be dated. Under current regulations, the certificate is valid for two years, unless the driver has a medical condition that does not prohibit driving but does require more frequent monitoring . In such situations, the medical certificate should be issued for a shorter length of time. The physical examination should be done carefully and at least as complete as is indicated by the attached form. Contact the FMCSA at (202) 366-4001 for further information (a vision exemption, qualifying drivers under 49 CFR 391.64, etc.). Interpretation of Medical Standards Since the issuance of the regulations for physical qualifications of commercial drivers, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has published recommendations called Advisory Criteria to helpmedical examiners in determining whether a driver meets the physical qualifications for commercial driving. These recommendations have been condensed to provide information to medical examiners that (1) is directly relevant to the physical examination and (2) is not already included in the medical examination form. The specific regulation is printed in italics and it's reference by section is highlighted. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations -Advisory Criteria- Loss of Limb: \u00a7391.41(b)(1) A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person: Has no loss of a foot, leg, hand or an arm, or has been granted a Skill Performance Evaluation (SPE) Certificate pursuant to Section 391.49. Limb Impairment:\u00a7391.41(b)(2) A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person: Has no impairment of: (i) A hand or finger which interferes with prehension or power grasping; or (ii) An arm, foot, or leg which interferes with the ability to perform normal tasks associated with operating a commercial motor vehicle; or (iii) Any other significant limb de fect or limitation which interferes with the ability to perform normal tasks associated with operating a commercial motor vehicle; or (iv) Has been granted a Skill Performance Evaluation (SPE) Certificate pursuant to Section 391.49. A person who suffers loss of a foot, leg, hand or arm or whose limb impairment in any way interferes with the safe performance of normal tasks associated with operating a commercial motor vehicle is subject to the Skill Performance Evaluation Certification Program pursuant to section 391.49, assuming the person is otherwise qualified. With the advancement of technology, medical aids and equipment modifications have been developed to compensate for certain disabilities. The SPE Certification Program (formerly the Limb Waiver Program) was designed to allow persons with the loss of a foot or limb or with functional impairment to qualify under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) by use of prosthetic devices or equipment modifications which enable them to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle. Since there are no medical aids equivalent to the original body or limb, certain risks are still present, and thus restrictions may be included on individual SPE certificates when a State Director for the FMCSA determines they are necessary to be consistent with safety and public interest. If the driver is found otherwise medically qualified (391.41(b)(3) through (13)), the medical examiner must check on the medical certificate that the driver is qualified only if accompanied by a SPE certificate. The driver and the employing motor carrier are subject to appropriate penalty if the driver operates a motor vehicle in interstate or foreign commerce without a curent SPE certificate for his/her physical disability. Diabetes \u00a7391.41(b)(3) A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person: Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus currently requiring insulin for control. Diabetes mellitus is a disease which, on occasion, can result in a loss of consciousness or disorientation in time and space. Individuals who require insulin for control have conditions which can get out of control by the use of too much or too little insulin, or food intake not consistent with the insulin dosage. Incapacitation may occur from symptoms of hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic reactions (drowsiness, semiconsciousness, diabetic coma or insulin shock). The administration of insulin is, within itself, a complicated process requiring insulin, syringe, needle, alcohol sponge and a sterile technique. Factors related to long-haul commercial motor vehicle operations, such as fatigue, lack of sleep, poor diet, emotional conditions, stress, and concomitant illness, compound the dangers, the FMCSA has consistently held that a diabetic who uses insulin for control does not meet the minimum physical requirements of the FMCSRs. Hypoglycemic drugs, taken orally, are sometimes prescribed for diabetic individuals to help stimulate natural body production of insulin. If the condition can be controlled by the use of oral medication and diet, then an individual may be qualified under the present rule. CMV drivers who do not meet the Federal diabetes standard may call (703) 448-3094 for an application for a diabetes exemption. (See Conference Report on Diabetic Disorders and Commercial Drivers and Insulin-Using Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers at: http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/medreports.htm) Cardiovascular Condition \u00a7391.41(b)(4) A person is physically qualified to drive a commercialmotor vehicle if that p erson: Has no current clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency, thrombosis or any other cardiovascular disease of a variety known to be accompanied by syncope, dyspnea, collapse or congestive cardiac failure . The term \"has no current clinical diagnosis of\" is specifically designed to encompass: \" a clinical diagnosis of\" (1) a current cardiovascular condition, or (2) a cardiovascular condition which has not fully stabilized regardless of the time limit The term \" known to be Chiropractic Sunrise 228 (See Conference on Pulmonary/Respiratory Disorder s and Commercial Drivers at : http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/medreports.htm accompanied by\" is designed to include a clinical diagnosi s of a cardiovascular disease (1) which is accompanied by symptoms of syncope, dyspnea, collaps e or congestiv e cardiac failure; and/ or (2) which i s likel y to cause syncope, dyspnea, collapse or congestive cardiac failure. It is the int ent of t he FMCSRs t o render unqualified, a driver who has a current cardiovascular disease which is accompanied by and/ or likely to cause symptoms of syncope, dyspnea, collapse, or congestive cardiac failure. However, the subjective decisi on of whether the natur e and severity of an individual's condition will li kely caus e symptoms of cardiovascular insufficienc y is on an individual basi s and qualification rests with the medical exami ner and the mot or carrier. In those cases where there is an occurrenc e of cardiovascular insufficiency (myocardial infarction, throm bosis, etc.), it is suggested before a driv er is certified that he or she have a normal resting and stress electrocardiogram (ECG), no residual complications and no physical limitations, and is taking no medication likely t o interfere with safe drivi ng. Coronary artery bypass surger y and pacemaker implantati on are remedial procedures and thus, not unqualifying. Implantable cardiovert er defibrillators are disqualifying due to risk of syncope. Coumadi n is a medical treatment which can improv e the healt h and safety of the driver and shoul d not, by its use, medically disqualif y the commercial driver. The emphasi s shoul d be on the underlying medical condition(s) which require treatmen t and the general health of the driver. T he FMCSA s hould be contacted at (202) 366-4001 for additional recommendations regarding the physical qualificati on of drivers on coumadin. (See Cardiovasul ar Advisory Panel Guideline s for the Medical examination of Commerci al Motor Vehicl e Drivers at: http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/medreports.htm ) on \u00a7391.41(b)(5) A pers on i s physicall y qualified to drive a commercial mot or vehicle if that pers on: Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of a respiratory dysfunction likely to interfere with ability t o control and drive a commercial mot or vehicle safely . Since a driv er must be alert at all times, any change i n his or her ment al state is in direct conflict with highw ay safety . Even the slightest impairment in respiratory functi on under emergenc y conditi ons (when greater oxygen suppl y i s necessary f or performanc e) may be detrimental to saf e driving. There are many conditions that interfere with oxygen exchange and may result in incapacitation, includi ng emphysema, chronic asthma, carcinoma, tuberculosis , and sleep apnea. If the medic al exami ner detects a respiratory dysfunction, that in any w ay is likely t o interfere with the driver's abilit y to safel y contr ol and drive a commercial mot or vehicle, the driver must be referred t o a special ist for further evaluation and therapy. Anticoagulati on therapy for deep vein thrombosi s and/ or pulmonar y thromboembolism is not unqualifying onc e optimum dose is achieved, provided lower extremity venous examinations remain normal and the treating physici an gives a favorabl e recommendation. Hypertension \u00a7391.41(b)(6) A pers on i s physicall y qualified to driv e a commercial mot or vehicle if that pers on: Has no current clinical diagnosis of high blood pressur e likely to interfere with ability to operate a commercial mot or vehicle safely. Hypertension alone is unlikely to cause sudden collapse; however , the likelihood increases when target or gan damage, particularl y cerebral vascular disease, is present. This regulatory criteria is based on FMCSA' s Cardiovascular Advisory Guidelines for the Examination of CMV Drivers , which used the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Detecti on, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (1997). Stage 1 hypertension corresponds to a systolic BP of 140-159 mmHg and/ or a diastolic B P of 90-99 mmHg. T he driver with a BP in this range is at l ow risk f or hypertension- related acute incapacitation and may be medically certified t o drive for a one- y ear period. Certificati on examinations should be done annua lly thereafter and should be at or less than 140/90. If less than 160/100, certification m ay be extended one time for 3 months . A blood pressure of 160- 179 systolic and/or 100- 109 diastolic i s considered Stage 2 hypertension, and t he driv er i s not necessarily unqualified during evaluation and institution of treatment. The driver is given a one tim e certification of three mont hs to reduce his or her bl ood pressure to less than or equal to 140/90. A blood pressur e in this range is an absolute indication for anti -hypertensive drug therapy. Provided treatment is well tolerat ed and t he driver demonstrates a BP value of 140/ 90 or less, he or s he may be certified for one y ear from date of the initial exam . The driver is certifi ed annually thereafter . A blood pressure at or great er than 180 (systolic) and 110 (diastolic ) is considered Stage 3, hi gh risk for an acut e BP-related event. The driv er m ay not be qualifi ed, ev en temporarily, until reduced to 140/90 or less and treatment i s well tolerated. The driv er m ay be certified f or 6 months and biannually (every 6 months ) thereafter if at recheck BP i s 140/ 90 or less . Annual recertification is recommended if the medic al examiner does not know the severity of hypertension pri or to treatment. An elevated blood pressure finding should be confirm ed by at least two subsequent measurements on differ ent days . Treatment incl udes nonpharmacologic and pharmacologi c modalities as well as counseling to reduc e ot her risk factors. Most antihypertensive medications als o have side effects, the importance of which must be j udged on an individual basis. Individual s mus t be alerted to t he hazar ds of these medications while driving. Si de effects of somnolenc e or syncope are particulary undesirable i n commercial drivers . Secondary hypertension is bas ed on the above stages. Evaluation is warranted if patient is persistently hypertensive on maximal or near -maximal doses of 2-3 pharmacologic agents. Some causes of secondary hypertension m ay be amenable to surgical intervention or specific pharmacologic disease. (See Cardiovascular Advisory Panel Guidelines f or the Medical Examination of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers at : http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/medreports.htm ) Rheumatic, Arthritic, Orthopedic, Muscular, Neuromuscular or \u00a7391.41(b)(7) A pers on i s physicall y qualified to drive a commercial mot or vehicle if that pers on: Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of rheumatic, arthritic , orthopedic, muscular, neuromuscular or vascular diseas e which interferes with the ability to control and operate a commercial motor vehicle safely . Certain diseases are known to have acute episodes of transient muscle weakness , poor muscular coordination (ataxia), abnormal sensati ons (paresthesia), decreas ed muscular tone (hypotonia), visual disturbances and pain which may be suddenl y incapacitating. With each recurring episode, thes e symptoms m ay become more pronounced and remain for l onger periods of time. Ot her diseases have more insidious onsets and displ ay symptoms of muscl e wasting (atrophy), swelling and paresthesia which m ay not suddenl y incapacitate a person but may restrict his/ her movements and eventuall y interfere with the abilit y to safel y operate a motor vehicle. I n many instances these diseases are degenerative in natur e or m ay result in deteriorati on of the involved ar ea. Once the individual has been diagnosed as having a rheumatic, arthritic , orthopedic, muscular, neuromuscular or vascular disease, then he/she has an established histor y of that disease. The physician, when examining an individual, should consider the foll owing: (1) the nature and severity of the individual's conditi on (such as sensory loss or loss of strength); (2) the degree of limitation present (suc h as range of motion); (3) the likelihood of progressive limitati on (not always present initially but m ay manifest itself ov er time); and (4) the likelihood of sudden incapacitati on. If severe functional impairm ent exists, the driver does not qualify. In cases where more fr equent monitoring is required, a certificate for a shorter period of tim e may be issued. (See Conference on Neurological Disorders and Commerci al Drivers at : http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/medreports.htm ) Chiropractic Sunrise 229Epilepsy \u00a7391.41(b)(8) A person is phy sically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person: Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or any other condition which is likely to cause loss of consciousness or any loss of ability to control a motor vehicle. Epilepsy is a chronic functional disease characterized by seizures or episodes that occur without warning, resulting in loss of voluntary control which may lead to loss of consciousness and/or seizures. Therefore, the following drivers cannot be qualified: (1) a driver who has a medical history of epilepsy; (2) a driver who has a current clinical diagnosis of epilepsy; or (3) a driver who is taking antiseizure medication. If an individual has had a sudden episode of a nonepileptic seizure or loss of consciousness of unknown cause which did not require antiseizure medication, the decision as to whether that person's condition will likely cause loss of consciousness or loss of ability to control a motor vehicle is made on an individual basis by the medical examiner in consultation with the treating physician. Before certification is considered, it is suggested that a 6 month waiting period elapse from the time of the episode. Following the waiting period, it is suggested that the individual have a complete neurological examination. If the results of the examination are negative and antiseizure medication is not required, then the driver may be qualified. In those individual cases where a driver has a seizure or an episode of loss of consciousness that resulted from a known medical condition (e.g., drug reaction, high temperature, acute infectious disease, dehydration or acute metabolic disturbance), certification should be deferred until the driver has fully recovered from that condition and has no existing residual complications, and not taking antiseizure medication. Drivers with a history of epilepsy/seizures off antiseizure medication and seizure-free for 10 years may be qualified to drive a CMV in interstate commerce. Interstate drivers with a history of a single unprovoked seizure may be qualified to drive a CMV in interstate commerce if seizure-free and off antiseizure medication for a 5-year period or more. (See Conference on Neurological Disorders and Commercial Drivers at: http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/medreports.htm) Mental Disorders \u00a7391.41(b)(9) A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person: Has no mental, nervous, organic or functional disease or psychiatric disorder likely to interfere with ability to drive a motor vehicle safely. Emotional or adjustment problems contribute directly to an individual's level of memory, reasoning, attention, and judgment. These problems often underlie physical disorders. A variety of functional disorders can cause drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, weakness or paralysis that may lead to incoordination, inattention, loss of functional control and susceptibility to accidents while driving. Physical fatigue, headache, impaired coordination, recurring physical ailments and chronic \"nagging\" pain may be present to such a degree that certification for commercial driving is inadvisable. Somatic and psychosomatic complaints should be thoroughly examined when determining an individual's overall fitness to drive. Disorders of a periodically incapacitating nature, even in the early stages of development, may warrant disqualification. Many bus and truck drivers have documented that \"nervous trouble\" related to neurotic, personality, or emotional or adjustment problems is responsible for a significant fraction of their preventable accidents. The degree to which an individual is able to appreciate, evaluate and adequately respond to environmental strain and emotional stress is critical when assessing an individual's mental alertness and flexibility to cope with the stresses of commercial motor vehicle driving. When examining the driver, it should be kept in mind that individuals who live under chronic emotional upsets may have deeply ingrained maladaptive or erratic behavior patterns. Excessively antagonistic, instinctive, impulsive, openly aggressive, paranoid or severely depressed behavior greatly interfere with the driver's ability to drive safely. Those individuals who are highly susceptible to frequent states of emotional instability (schizophrenia, affective psychoses, paranoia, anxiety or depressive neuroses) may warrant disqualification. Careful consideration should be given to the side effects and interactions of medications in the overall qualification determination. See Psychiatric Conference Report for specific recommendations on the use of medications and potential hazards for driving. (See Conference on Psychiatric Disorders and Commercial Drivers at: http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/medreports.htm) Vision \u00a7391.41(b)(10) A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person: Has distant visual acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in each eye with or without corrective lenses or visual acuity separately corrected to 20/40 (Snellen) or better with corrective lenses, distant binocular acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in both eyes with or without corrective lenses, field of vision of at least 70 degrees in the horizontal meridian in each eye, and the ability to recognize the colors of traffic signals and devices showing standard red, green, and amber. The term \"ability to recognize the colors of\" is interpreted to mean if a person can recognize and distinguish among traffic control signals and devices showing standard red, green and amber, he or she meets the minimum standard, even though he or she may have some type of color perception deficiency. If certain color perception tests are administered, (such as Ishihara, Pseudoisochromatic, Yarn) and doubtful findings are discovered, a controlled test using signal red, green and amber may be employed to determine the driver's ability to recognize these colors. Contact lenses are permissible if there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the driver has good tolerance and is well adapted to their use. Use of a contact lens in one eye for distance visual acuity and another lens in the other eye for near vision is not acceptable, nor telescopic lenses acceptable for the driving of commercial motor vehicles. If an individual meets the criteria by the use of glasses or contact lenses, the following statement shall appear on the Medical Examiner's Certificate: \"Qualified only if wearing corrective lenses.\" CMV drivers who do not meet the Federal vision standard may call ( 703) 448-3094 for an application for a vision exemption. (See Visual Disorders and Commercial Drivers at: http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/medreports.htm) Hearing \u00a7391.41(b)(11) A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person: First perceives a forced whispered voice in the better ear at not less than 5 feet with or without the use of a hearing aid, or, if tested by use of an audiometric device, does not have an average hearing loss in the better ear greater than 40 decibels at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz with or without a hearing aid when the audiometric device is calibrated to American National Standard (formerly ADA Standard) Z24.5-1951. Since the prescribed standard under the FMCSRs is the American Standards Association (ANSI), it may be necessary to convert the audiometric results from the ISO standard to the ANSI standard. Instructions are included on the Medical Examination report form. If an individual meets the criteria by using a hearing aid, the driver must wear that hearing aid and have it in operation at all times while driving. Also, the driver must be in possession of a spare power source for the hearing aid. For the whispered voice test, the individual should be stationed at least 5 feet from the examiner with the ear being tested turned toward the examiner. The other ear is covered. Using the breath which remains after a normal expiration, the examiner whispers words or random numbers such as 66, 18, Chiropractic Sunrise 23023, etc. The examiner should not use only sibilants (s sounding materials). The opposite ear should be tested in the same manner. If the individual fails the whispered voice test, the audiometric test should be administered. If an individual meets the criteria by the use of a hearing aid, the following statement must appear on the Medical Examiner's Certificate \"Qualified only when wearing a hearing aid.\" (See Hearing Disorders and Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers at: http://www/fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesr egs/medreports. htm) Drug Use \u00a7391.41(b)(12) A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person does not use any drug or substance identified in 21 CFR 1308.11, an amphetamine, a narcotic, or other habit -forming drug. A driver may use a non-Schedule I drug or substance that is identified in the other Schedules in 21 part 1308 if the substance or drug is prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner who: (A) is familiar with the driver's medical history, and assigned duties; and (B) has advised the driver that the prescribed substance or drug will not adversely affect the driver's ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle. This exception does not apply to methadone. The intent of the medical certification process is to medically evaluate a driver to ensure that the driver has no medical condition which interferes with the safe performance of driving tasks on a public road. If a driver uses an amphetamine, a narcotic or any other habit -forming drug, it may be cause for the driver to be found medically unqualified. If a driver uses a Schedule I drug or substance, it will be cause for the driver to be found medically unqualified. Motor carriers are encouraged to obtain a practitioner's written statement about the effects on transportation safety of the use of a particular drug. A test for controlled substances is not required as part of this biennial certification process. The FMCSA or the driver's employer should be contacted directly for information on controlled substances and alcohol testing under Part 382 of the FMCSRs. The term \"uses\" is designed to encompass instances of prohibited drug use determined by a physician through established medical means. This may or may not involve body fluid testing. If body fluid testing takes place, positive test results should be confirmed by a second test of greater specificity. The term \"habit -forming\" is intended to include any drug or medication generally recognized as capable of becoming habitual, and which may impair the user's ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle safely. The driver is medically unqualified for the duration of the prohibited drug(s) use and until a second examination shows the driver is free from the prohibited drug(s) use. Recertification may involve a substance abuse evaluation, the successful completion of a drug rehabilitation program, and a negative drug test result. Additionally, given that the certification period is normally two years, the examiner has t he option to certify for a period of less than 2 years if this examiner determines more frequent monitoring is required. (See Conference on Neurological Disorders and Commercial Drivers and Conference on Psychiatric Disorders and Commercial Drivers at: http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/medreports.htm) Alcoholism \u00a7391.41(b)(13) A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person: Has no current clinical diagnosis of alcoholism. The term \"current clinical diagnosis of\" is specifically designed to encompass a current alcoholic illness or those instances where the individual's physical condition has not fully stabilized, regardless of the time element. If an individual shows signs of having an alcohol -use problem, he or she should be referred to a specialist. After counseling and/or treatment, he or she may be considered for certification. Chiropractic Sunrise 231 Appendix H Rebuttals to Draft Recommendations Chiropractic Sunrise 232 Chiropractic Sunrise 233Chiropractic Scope of Practice Sunrise Rebuttals to Draft Report Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the initial findings of the Chiropractic Scope of Practice Sunrise Review. After reading the draft document an d the recommendations of the panel I would like to provide the following input: On Page 7 of the Summary of Information/Bac kground the committee misquotes RCW 18.25.005 which state \"As part of a chiropractic differential diagnosis, a chiropractor SHALL perform a physical examination. The Draft Document mistakenly subs titutes the word \"may\" for \"shall\" which is a very significant error. May implies that this level of phys ical examination is optional while shall indicates that these physical examinations are performed routinely on all patients and are critical in the process of differential diagnosis. Clearly this error refl ects and underlying bias and misinformation in the understanding of the education, training and daily practice of the Doctor of Chiropractic. Based upon the error in language above, It appears th at the Department is under the unfortunate and incorrect opinion that that HB1573 would be an expansi on of the scope of a Doctor of Chiropractic when in reality it is a clarification of the existing scope . Extensive information was presented on the curriculum of chiropractic colleges and universities that supported the position that Doctors of Chiropractic have the education and training in all components of phys ical examination as well as the additional training outlined in the DACBSP and CCSP specialties. It is si mply incorrect that the education does not exist in the chiropractic programs and that the specialty prog rams primarily focus are on spinal and extremity manipulation, exercise physiology and sports-specific biomechanics. Is it possible that there is some confusion with other specialty programs such as the CCEP and DACRB which to focus more on spinal and extremity or that the information provided detailing the parameters of the DACBSP and CCSP programs were essentially ignored or dismissed? PPEs and DOT examinations are indeed Screenings exams; most evident by the fact that these examinations are performed by primary level providers who clearly \"screen\" for anomalies that would place and student athlete or DOT driver at risk and make appropriate referrals for any anomaly. These doctors do not provide treatment for these conditions that may be discovered during the course of these screening examinations. Similarly for the concer n regarding prescriptive authority or focus on pharmacology, doctors of any specialty who perform theses examination do not prescribe medication for these individuals. It is disappointing that, although the supportive evid ence presented regarding the curriculum, education and training of a Doctor of Chiropractic clearly demonstrates that these examinations are with the DCs scope of practice, that the Department can come to this conclusion. Doctors of Chiropractic in 48 states are performing these examinations which is of significant benefit to their patients and community. Myself and my colleagues in Washington state would sincerely appreciate a review of the facts and explicit detail presented in this case. If the review is thorough, fair and comprehensive I remain certain that the panel would come to a far different conclusion. Thank you for your time and consideration. Dr. Lorri Nichols DC, CCEP Chiropractic Sunrise 234Chiropractic Sunrise 235Chiropractic RCW 18.25.005(3) says, \"As part of a chiropractic differential diagnosis, a chiropractor shall perform a physical examination...\" There is no RCW that says comprehensive physical exams are not part of the chiropractic scope of practice. The \"physical examination\" I was taught it school is comprehensive. 2) Prescriptive authority is not necessary to perform a PPE. It is only necessary to treat a condition (such as asthma) that may be apparent through an examination, in which case an appropriate referral to an MD would be warranted. 3) It is incorrect to say that the DACBSP certifi cation focuses primarily on spine, extremities, and bio- mechanics (in other words, orthopedics). 25% of th e CCSP/DACBSP is Emergency Medicine. Further, to achieve a DACBSP, one must perform an EMS prac tical examination to show proficiency as an emergency medical technician. Other parts of the CCSP/DACBSP training include extensive training in the management of concussion, and further there is emphasis on the keys to a proper cardiac exam (especially as it relates to a PPE). 4) Many of the MD's qualified to perform PPE's do no t have a \"daily practice that includes functions of primary care.\" For example, orthopedists, physiatrists, and many sports physicians all have daily patient encounters that are comparable to that of a ch iropractor and not a General Practitioner. These three specialties are examples of MD's that do not daily ausculate hearts and palpate abdomens, yet they are still allowed to perform PPE's. 5) Preventing death in sport is certainly the biggest consideration. But the number one killer in sport (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) is not traditionally detected through a routine examination. Clues to HCM are only found in the patient history. Therefore, there remains no solid evidence that the number of deaths in sport will increase if DC's were allowed to perform PPEs. Ben McCay, DC I am writing on behalf of Association of Washingt on Healthcare Plan (AWHP) members regarding the Department of Health's (DOH) draft sunrise review report on the House Bill 1573 proposal to expand chiropractors' scope of practice to include performance of physical examinations for sports physicals and commercial driver's licenses. We appreciate the extensive research and careful eval uation that went into crafting the DOH draft sunrise review report findings and recommendations. We agree with the report findings that support that ex amining a patient to evaluate his or her overall health is the job of a primary care provider who can use his or her broad spectrum of training, clinical residency, and experience. It also found sports physical examinations and commercial driver's license physical examinations are not merely screenings, but rather are intended to be comprehensive physical examinations. Additionally, it concluded these examina tions are clearly not within the current scope of practice for chiropractors in Washington, and adding them would place patients at risk of harm. We are in agreement with these findings. Given that our first and foremost concern with the pr oposed scope of practice expansion is patient safety, we believe these DOH findings should be taken very seriously. Accordingly, we are convinced it is in the best interest of those we serve to strongly support DOH's draft sunrise review report recommendation that the applicant's proposal and HB 1573 not be adopted. Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments . Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or to discuss. Chiropractic Sunrise 270Sydney Smith Zvara, Executive Director, Asso ciation of Washington Healthcare Plans I respectfully, strongly agree with the draft response of the Department of Health. Pre-Participation Sports Physical Examinations and Commercial Driver 's License Physicals do not fall within chiropractic scope of practice, and certainly not w ith 18 hours of continuing education. Thank you for the opportunity to comment. Gordon Oakes I concur with the below thoughts. I do not s upport chiropractors practicing outside their scope. Jason Attaman The department does not support expanding the chiroprac tic scope of practice to include PPEs for student athletes and commercial driver's license physicals (CMV exams). Since the department believes these physicals are outside the chiropractic scope of practice, we reviewed whether changing the definitions in RCW 18.25.005 to expand the scope would meet the sunrise criteria. The department found risk of patient harm if PPEs and CMV exams are added to the ch iropractic scope of practice. Specifically: Addition of PPEs and CMV exams would ex pand the chiropractic scope of practice well outside of their current scope of dia gnosing and treating conditions relating to the musculoskeletal system. The chiropractic scope of practice does not contain prescriptive authority, nor do the educational programs include a focus on pharmacology, which is necessary in both types of physical examinations. Although chiropractic training includes basic understanding of body and organ systems, including the cardiovascular system, the department is unable to find that it prepares chiropractors to potentially be the sole evaluators of all or most medical conditions. The DACBSP specialty certification training's primary focus also appears to be on spinal and extremity manipulation, exercise physiology, and sports-specific biomechanics. DRAFT Chiropractic Sunrise Page 5 Examining a patient to evaluate his or her overall health is the job of a primary care provider who can use his or her broad spectrum of training, clinical residency, and experience to conduct the evaluations, and whose daily practice includes functions of primary care. PPEs and CMV exams are not merely \"screenings.\" They are intended to be comprehensive physical examinations, and are sometimes the only examination the person receives regularly. If the scope of practice is expanded for th ese types of examinations, it could open the door to expanding it for all physical examinations. Jason G. Attaman, DO, FAAPMR My name is Matt Brennan, and I am a licensed athletic trainer in the state of Washington. I support the Department of Health's position of not endorsing a change in the chiropractor's scope of practice. The WSCA's statement that they are being discriminated against for not being allowed to perform PPE's is nonsense! Healthcare providers have role delineations. As an athletic trainer, I am not allowed to perform Chiropractic Sunrise 271manipulations of the spine. This is role delineati on, not discrimination. Heart surgeons do not perform spinal fusion surgeries. Neurosurgeons do not perform ACL reconstructions of the knee. The list goes on. I ask you to refuse their request without hesitation. Matt Brennan, ATC, AT-L Stanwood High School On behalf of all the chiropractic college programs in the United States, all accredited by the United States Department of Education's recognized accreditors, I wr ite to support inclusion of doctors of chiropractic in the PPEs. The question before this body is whet her the doctor of chiropractic has the education and training to meet the requirements for PPE in the state of Washington. They do. The education and training received at doctor of chiropractic programs fulfill the needs and diagnostic ability to perform the PPE as they have and do across th e country (from California to Georgia and back to Nevada for example). Doctors of ch iropractic have five academic year s of post undergraduate education to receive their clinical doctorate which has been recognized and accepted by the US Department of Transportation for their certification process. In fact doctors of chiropractic and medical doctors sit side by side in their certifying exams. To exclude one is to exclude the other. Among many points the Washington state statute uses the term \"shall\" in reference to examinations by doctors of chiropractic, not the alternative \"may\", so legal counsel will provide the distinction that it is a requirement not an alternative.

At page 13 the draft report states that Oregon allows chiropractors to perform dry needling. The footnote references OAR 811-015-0036, a regulation promulgated by Oregon's Board of Chiropractic Examiners. This statement is no longer correct. On July 29, 2011 the Oregon Court of Appeals granted a motion to stay the operation of OAR 811-015- 0036, pending full judicial review. The Board moved for reconsideration of the stay, and the Court denied that motion on November 10, 2011. We have enclosed both the Order granting the stay and the Order denying reconsideration. Meanwhile, the Board of Chiropractic Examiners issued a press release May 13, 2013 (also enclosed), which states, \"Chiropractic physicians who have been certified should cease all practice of dry needling.\" Most recently, the Court of Appeals heard arguments on July 17, 2013. No decision has been issued as of this writing. We hope this information updates the draft report, and we ask that the final report include this more current description of the status of dry needling in Oregon. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft report. Sincerely, The WEAMA Board of Directors Enclosures: Stay and Denial of Reconsideration, Oregon Court of Appeals No. A148924 OBCE press release Chiropractic Sunrise 273 Appeals Court Commissioner Stays Dry Needling Rule May 13, 2013 Update below Notice to Oregon Chiropractic Physicians & Interested Persons July 10, 2012 - \"The OAAOM now has until July 20th to file a reply brief. The court will schedule oral argument for sometime after September, probably. After argument, the court will either affirm without opinion within a few weeks (3 or so), or will write an opinion deciding the case, which could take a year or more, but usually takes about 6 months.\" ------------------------- The Court of Appeals Appellate Commissioner issued a Stay Order dated July 29, 2011. This suspends the new rule until the issue is resolved by a full panel of judges after hearing a full presentation of the arguments. The OBCE's dry needling rule is no longer in effect pending a full proceeding and argument before the Oregon Court of Appeals. This could be a lengthy process. Chiropractic physicians who have been certified should cease all practice of dry needling. The OBCE may not certify any new chiropractic physicians during the period of the Stay. (Visit the OBCE's website, and look under Current Topics to access the web links) May 13, 2013 Oral Argument before the Court of Appeals - The court has set oral argument for July 17th at 1:30 in the Supreme Court courtroom, 1163 State Street, Salem Oregon (due East of the State Capitol). This is open to the public to observe. It lasts about an hour, with attorney for t he plaintiffs and the respondent (OBCE) making the case to a three -judge panel. The judges ask questions. There is no public comment or testimony accepted. The Court then considers the case. Recent experience has shown it could be up to a year before a ru ling is issued.
