GROUPS R ECOMMENDED FOR VACCINATION Routine annual influenza vacci nation is recommended for all persons aged 6 months who do not have contraindications. A licensed, age-appropr iate influenza vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4) shoul d be used. Consult package information for age indications. Emphasis shoul d be placed on vaccination of high-risk groups and their contacts/caregivers. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts shoul d focus on delivering vaccination to ( no hierarchy i mplied by order months; oAdults aged 50 years; oPersons with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (excluding isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus); oPersons who are i mmunocompromised due to any cause, (including medications or HIV infection); oWomen who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season; oChildren and adolescents (aged 6 months through 18 years) receiving aspirin- or sali cylate-contain ing medications and who might be at risk for Reye syndrome; oResidents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities; oAmerican Indians/Alaska Natives ; oPersons who are extremely obese (BMI 40); and oCaregivers and contacts of t hose at risk: Health care personnel in inpatient and outpatient care settings, m edical emergency-respons e workers, employees of nursing home and l ong-term care facilities who have contact with patients or residents, and students in these professions who will have contact with patients; Househol d contacts and caregivers o f children aged 59 months (i.e., <5 years), particularly contacts of children aged <6 months, and adults aged 50 years; and Household contacts and caregivers of p ersons with medical conditions that put them at high risk of severe complications from influenza. TIMING O F VACCINATION Vaccination should be offered by end of October; however, vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating a nd unexpired vaccine is available. Chil dren aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses (see Figure) should receive their first dose as soon a s possible after vaccine becomes available, and the second dose 4 weeks later . ADULTS AGED 65 YEARS Persons aged 65 years may receive any age-appr comparator standard-dose IIV3 i n a large randomized trial, and may provide better protection than standard dose IIV3 for this age group. However, v accination should not be delayed to find a particular product i f an appropriate one is available.VOLUME PER DOSE FOR CHI LDREN A ND A DUL TS Children aged 6 dose volume differs f or thes e different brands. Care should be taken to administer the correct dose. Children aged 3 through 17 years may receive 0.5mL of an age - appropriate intramuscular IIV formulation. Adults aged 18 years and older may receive 0.5mL intramuscul arly of an age-appr opriate IIV a smaller intramuscul ar dose (e.g., 0.25mL) is administered to a person 36 months of age: oIf the error is discovered immediately, an additi onal 0.25mL dose should be administered to provide a full 0.5mL dose. oIf the error is discovered later (after the recipient has left the vaccination setting), a full 0.5mL dose should be administered as soon as the recipient can return. Heal thy non-preg nant persons (see LAIV4 Contraindications and Precautions on page 4) aged 2 through 49 years may alternatively receive 0.2mL of LAIV4 intranasally (0.1mL per nostril using supplied sprayer). NUMBER OF DOSES NEEDED FOR CHILDREN AGED 6 MONTHS THROUGH 8 YEARS Determine the number of doses needed for this age group as follows: PREGNANT WOMEN All women who are pregnant or who might be pregnant during the influenza season should receive influenza vaccine. oAn age-ap propriate IIV or RIV4 may be used. oLAIV4 should not be used during pregnancy. Influenza vaccine can be administered at any time during pregnancy. Yes No / Don't know Has the child received 2 dose s of trivalen t or quadrivalent influenza v accine before July 1, 2018 ? (Doses need not have been given during same or consecutive seasons) 1 dose of 2018- 19 influenza vaccine 2 doses of 2018- 19 influenza vaccine (administered 4 weeks apart) 1 updated 8-23-2018IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PERSONS Immunocompromised persons should receive an age-app ropriate IIV or RIV4. LAIV4 should not be used for immunocompromised persons. Immune response to vaccines might be blunted in immunocompromised persons. Timing of vaccination might be a consideration (e.g., in some period before or after an immunocompromising intervention). CAREGIVERS AND CONTACTS OF HIGH-R ISK PERSONS Caregivers and contacts (including those of immunosuppressed persons) may receive a ny age-appr opriate IIV or RIV4. LAIV4 may be given to caregivers and contacts of persons who are not severely immunocompromised (i.e., who do not require a protected environment). Health care personnel or hospital vi sitors who receive LAIV4 should avoi d providing care for severely immunosuppressed persons (thos e requiring a protected environment) for 7 da ys a fter vaccination. PERSONS WITH EGG ALLERGY Persons who are able to eat lightly cooked egg (e.g., scrambled egg) without reaction are unlikely to be egg-alle rgic. Persons who have experienced only hi ves after exposure to egg should receive any licensed, recommended, age-appr opriate influenza vacci ne (i.e., IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4). Persons reporting symptoms other than hives after e xposure to egg (such as angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis; or who required epinephrine or a not her emergency medical i ntervention) may also receive any l icensed and recommended infl uenza vaccine that is otherwise appropriate. oAdditionally, for these persons, vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and supervised by a health care provider who i s able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. A previous severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine, regardless of the component suspected of causing the reaction, i s a contraindication to future receipt of the vaccine. VACCINATION ISSUES FOR TRAVELERS Travelers who wish to reduce the risk for influenza infection should consider influenza vaccination, preferably 2 weeks before departure. Persons at high risk for complications of i nfluenza who were not vaccinated during the preceding fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccine before departure, if t hey plan to travel to the tropics, with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships, or to the Southern Hemisphere during April -September. Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere might differ in viral compositi on from Northern Hemisphere vaccine. Vaccination with Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine prior to travel to the Southern Hemisphere may be reasonable; however, only one Southern Hemisphere formulation is licensed by FDA (Fluzone Quadrivalent, S anofi Pasteur), and it is generally not commercially available i n the U.S.VACCINATION AND INFLUENZA ANTIVIRAL MEDICATIONS IIV and RIV4 may be administered to persons receiving influenza antiviral medications for treatment or chemoprophylaxis. Influenza antivirals may reduce the effectiveness of LAIV4, if administered from 48 hours before until 2 weeks after vaccination. ADMINISTRATION OF INFLUENZA VACCINE WITH OTHER VACCINES VACCINE ADVERS E EVENT REPORTING S YSTEM ( VAERS) VAERS is the national vaccine safety monitoring system that is co- managed by CDC and FDA. VAERS serves as an early warning system to detect possible safety problems with U.S. vaccines. Health care providers are required to report any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine, and adverse events listed i n the table at: https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_ Following_Vaccination.pdf For i nformation on h ow to report to VAERS, go the VAERS website at https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html .

Vacci nes admini stered simultaneously should be given at separate anatomi c sites. LAIV4 may be admini stered simultaneously with other live vaccines, however if not given simultaneously 4 weeks should pass between admini stration of LAIV4 and another live vaccine. Immunogenicity and safety of simultaneous or sequential administration of two vaccines containing novel (non- aluminum) adjuvants has not yet been evaluated. 2 updated 8-23-2018U.S. INFLUENZA VACCINE PRODUCTS FOR THE 2018 -19 SEASON INFLUENZA VACCINE COMPOSITION FOR 2018 -19 2018- 19 influenza vaccines will contain hemagglutinin (HA) derived from influenza viruses antigenically similar to those recommended by FDA. Trivalent vaccines will contain an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09- like virus, an A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016 (H3N2)- like virus; and a B/Colorado/06/2017- like virus (Victoria lineage). Quadrivalent vaccines will contain the same three HA antigens as trivalent vaccines, plus a B/Phuket/3073/2013 -like virus (Yamagata lineage).
