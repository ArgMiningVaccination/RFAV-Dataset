POLIC Y: IHSC health care staff provide COVID -19 vaccinations to ICE detainees when clinically indicated. IHSC health care providers may administer COVID -19 vaccines to ICE detainees only and are not authorized to administer COVID -19 vaccines to any federal empl oyee, contractor, or staff member. 4-1. IHSC health care providers must ensure appropriate prioritization and safe storage, preparation, and administration practices when immunizing individuals in ICE custody with COVID -19 vaccine(s). 4-2. In accordance with the Pub lic Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for Medical Countermeasures against COVID -19, this protocol enables license d practical/vocational nurses, registered nurses, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, and physicians to assess the need for COVID -19 vaccination and to administer the COVID -19 vaccine to patients without a separate medication order. 5. PROCEDURES : 5-1. COVID -19 Pandemic Response Procedures . 5-1.1 IHSC staff should not modify or discontinue any ICE pandemic response plan efforts (e.g., Fraihat monitoring, personal protective equipment wear, disinfection, and sanitation procedures) based on initiation or completion of COVID -19 vaccination efforts. 5-1.2 All mitigation and reporting procedures must remain in place until ERO leader ship notifies IHSC staff that these processes may be modified or discontinued. 5-2. Vaccination Scheduling . 5-2.1 IHSC staff should offer and administer COVID -19 vaccinations to all patients in accordance with FDA approvals or authorizations and ACIP recommendations for the appropriate age soon as practical after the patient enters ICE custody. 5-2.1.a The Moderna and Janssen vaccines may only be administered to adults (age 18+). 5-2.1.b The Pfizer -BioNTech vaccines may be administered to children ages 5 -11, and adolescents and adul ts ages 12+. Refer to section 5 -4.3 and 5 -8 for Pfizer vaccine preparation and dose information. 5-2.2 Detainees undergoing necessary cohorting (e.g., a new arrival detainee, detainee exposed to a possible active COVID -19 case) may receive the vaccine series wit hout delay. If a detainee receives Page 3 of 34 a first or second dose of the COVID -19 vaccine while cohorted, the detainee must complete the cohort as initially scheduled. 5-2.3 IHSC staff must screen patients during the intake process to assess their COVID -19 vaccination h istory . 5-2.3.a If the patient indicates that they have not received any previous doses of COVID -19 vaccines, the patient should be scheduled for an IMM appointment within 5 working days to be offered a COVID -19 vaccine. A working day is Monday -Friday and does no t include federal holidays. 5-2.3.b If the patient indicates that they have received any previous doses of a COVID -19 vaccine prior to arrival at the facility, refer to Appendix A (COVID -19 Vaccin e Algorithm Algorithm for Immunocompromised Persons) to determine the patient's need for additional COVID -19 vaccine doses. The intake staff member should log the patient's initial COVID -19 vaccination in the EHR as a previously administered immunization. 5-2.3.c If the patient indicates that they have been completely vaccinated against COVID -19, the intake staff member should log the patient's vaccination history in the EHR as a previously administered immunization . 5-2.3.d IHSC staff must confirm the patient's reported COVID -19 vaccination history with a medical record, including but not limited to a vaccination card, transfer summary, state immunization registry, or by confirming the vaccine administration with the source provider and/or subsequent custodial facility. Patients who report a history of receiving a COVID -19 vaccine series but who cannot confirm receipt should be treated as unvaccinated. 5-2.3.e IHSC staff should offer a booster dose of any COVID -19 vaccine to individuals who have completed a 2 -3 dose series of a WHO -approved, but not US -authorized, COVID -19 vaccine 3-5 months after the patient's last dose , as appropriate for their immunocompetence . Refer to Appendices A and B for additional information. 5-2.4 IHSC facility staff may determine the frequency of COVID -19 vaccinatio n efforts after considering the facility's patient turnover, Page 4 of 34 intake volumes, and average length of stay; vaccines should be offered as often as necessary to ensure that all eligible patients are offered the vaccine while in custody. Facilities may re -sched ule automatically created appointments to align with vaccination schedules. 5-2.5 IHSC staff should prioritize the offering and administration of COVID - 19 vaccines to all eligible patients above concerns of \"wasting\" of doses due to the short administration wind ow after a vial has been punctured.
