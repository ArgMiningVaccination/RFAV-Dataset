People get it for many purposes, including to help with pain, [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation), [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) flow, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep-tissue [massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits). The cups may be made of: - Glass - Bamboo - Earthenware - Silicone [Cupping therapy](https://www.webmd.com/balance/cupping-therapy) might be trendy now, but it's not new. It dates back to ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and Middle Eastern cultures. One of the oldest medical textbooks in the world, the Ebers Papyrus, describes how the ancient Egyptians used cupping therapy in 1,550 B.C. Types There are different methods of cupping, including: - Dry - Wet During both types of cupping, your therapist will put a flammable substance such as alcohol, herbs, or paper in a cup and set it on fire. As the fire goes out, they put the cup upside down on your [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin). As the air inside the cup cools, it creates a vacuum. This causes your skin to rise and redden as your [blood](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/rm-quiz-blood-basics) vessels expand. The cup is generally left in place for up to 3 minutes. A more modern version of cupping uses a rubber pump instead of fire to create the vacuum inside the cup. Sometimes therapists use silicone cups, which they can move from place to place on your skin for a [massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits)-like effect. Wet cupping creates a mild suction by leaving a cup in place for about 3 minutes. The therapist then removes the cup and uses a small scalpel to make light, tiny cuts on your skin. Next, they do a second suction to draw out a small quantity of [blood](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/rm-quiz-blood-basics). You might get 3-5 cups in your first session. Or you might just try one to see how it goes. It's rare to get more than 5-7 cups, the British Cupping Society notes. Afterward, you may get an antibiotic ointment and bandage to prevent infection. Your skin should look normal again within 10 days. Cupping therapy supporters believe that wet cupping removes harmful substances and toxins from the body to promote healing. But that's not proven. Some people also get \"needle cupping,\" in which the therapist first inserts [acupuncture](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/consider-acupuncture) needles and then puts cups over them. What Does the Research Show? There haven't been many scientific studies on cupping. One report, published in 2015 in the Journal of Traditional and [Complementary Medicine](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-alternative-medicine), notes that it could help with acne, herpes zoster, and pain management. That's similar to the findings from a 2012 report, published in PLoS One. Australian and Chinese researchers reviewed 135 studies on cupping. They concluded that cupping therapy may be effective when people also get other treatments, like [acupuncture](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/consider-acupuncture) or [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx), for various diseases and conditions, such as: [Herpes zoster](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/shingles/default.htm) [Acne](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/default.htm) - Facial paralysis [Cervical spondylosis](https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/guide/cervical-osteoarthritis-cervical-spondylosis) But those researchers noted many of the studies they reviewed could have been biased and that better studies are needed. The British Cupping Society says that cupping therapy is asthma](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/allergies-asthma) [Varicose veins](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-varicose-veins-basics) There isn't research to back all of that up. Side Effects Cupping is fairly safe, as long as you go to a trained health professional. But you could have these side effects in the area where the cups touch your skin: - Mild discomfort - Burns [Bruises](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/bruises-article) - Skin infection If the cups and equipment become contaminated with blood and are not sterilized correctly between patients, bloodborne diseases such as hepatitis B and C can be spread. What to Ask Your Doctor First Talk with your doctor before you start cupping or any other type of alternative or complementary medicine. And talk extensively with your cupping therapist, too, before you try it. Ask: - What conditions do they use cupping for? - What is your training? - What is your experience in using it? - Am I already getting the standard treatments for my condition? - Are there reasons I should "}
