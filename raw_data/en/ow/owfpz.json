Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection. Available athttp://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/pediatricguidelines.pdf . Accessed (insert date) [include page numbers, table number, etc. if applicable] Use of antiretrovirals in pediatric patients is evolving rapidly. These guidelines are updated regularly to provide current information.The most recent information is available athttp://aidsinfo.nih.gov . access AIDS info mobile siteGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection iWhat's New in the Pediatric Guidelines (Last updated March 5, 2015; last reviewed March 5, 2015) Key changes made by the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children (the Panel) to update the February 12, 2014, Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents inPediatric HIV Infection are summarized below. Throughout the document, text and references have beenupdated to include new publications where relevant. Minor changes and edits have been made to enhanceclarity and facilitate use of the Guidelines. The Panel has added a new section to address specific issues inantiretroviral therapy (ART) for neonates. All changes are highlighted. Diagnosis of HIV Infection Because children with perinatal HIV exposure aged 18 to 24 months may have residual maternal HIV antibodies, the Panel recommends that definitive exclusion or confirmation of HIV infection in childrenin this age group who are HIV antibody-positive should be based on a nucleic acid test (NAT) (AII). The AMPLICOR \u00aeHIV-1 DNA test, widely used for diagnosis of infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers since 1992, is no longer commercially available in the United States. The Panel cautions that thesensitivity and specificity of non-commercial HIV-1 DNA tests may differ from the sensitivity andspecificity of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved commercial test. Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection Because current pediatric HIV classification and thresholds for treatment initiation are based on absolute CD4 cell count, the Panel now recommends that absolute CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count should beused for monitoring immune status in children of all ages, with CD4 percentage as an alternative (AII). The Panel has added hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening to the schedule for clinical and laboratory monitoring in Table 3 when considering starting or changing to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs with activity against HBV , specifically lamivudine-, emtricitabine-, and tenofovir-containing regimens. The Panel has added Table 4 to provide information about primary, FDA-approved assays to monitor viral load. When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral-Naive Children The Panel has updated recommendations for when to initiate therapy in ARV-naive HIV-infected children to incorporate the updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Surveillance Case Definitionfor HIV Infection, which aligns children with adult and adolescent patients. It includes age-specific CD4 values, indicating a preference for the use of CD4 count over CD4 percentage in all ages (see Revised Surveillance Case Definition for HIV Infection at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6303.pdf ). Information about HIV infection stage based on age-specific CD4 cell count or percentage is provided in Table 6 , and Table 7 lists HIV-related symptoms. The Panel has now stratified the urgency for initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), recommending urgent initiation in all children younger than 12 months and in those aged 12 months andolder with CDC Stage 3-defining opportunistic illnesses or Stage 3 CD4 counts. The text providesguidance that in situations requiring urgent initiation of treatment, the clinical team should expedite adiscussion on adherence and provide increased, intensive follow-up in the first few weeks to support thechildren and families. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection iiWhat Drugs to Start: Initial Combination Therapy for Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Children The Panel has added integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimens as agents to be used in combination with two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Raltegravir can be used in children age 2 years and older and dolutegravir in children aged 12 years and older. Raltegravir is also licensed forinfants as young as 4 weeks but the Panel would consider usage only in special circumstances. The protease inhibitor (PI) atazanavir boosted with ritonavir is now considered an alternative PI in children aged 3 months through 5 years and remains a preferred drug for children 6 years and older. The two-NRTI combination of zidovudine and lamivudine or emtricitabine is now considered an alternative combination for adolescents older than 13 years. Specific Issues in Antiretroviral Therapy for Neonates The Panel has added a new section about ART for neonates to address specific issues raised by the ability to diagnose HIV infection within a few days of birth in conjunction with growing discussion and reports ofearly intensive ART of HIV-infected infants and infants at high risk of HIV infection. Available information about dosing and safety of individual ARV drugs in term and pre-term infants is summarized and discussed in the context of the benefits and risks of early intensive treatment. The Panel cautions that existing pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data are insufficient for the recommendation of a complete combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen to treat preterm infantsand term infants younger than 15 days (until 42 weeks postmenstrual age). The Panel recommends that neonatal care providers who are considering a three-drug ARV treatment regimen of term infants younger than 2 weeks or premature infants contact a pediatric HIV expert forguidance and individual case assessment of the risk/benefit ratio of treatment and for the latest informationon neonatal drug doses. The National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765) provides free clinical consultation on perinatal HIV care. Management of Medication Toxicity Toxicity table sections have been reviewed and updated throughout. Notable changes include newer data on the occurrence and management of central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects of efavirenz and theeffects on creatinine determination of newer ARV drugs dolutegravir, cobicistat, and rilpivirine. Central Nervous System Toxicity: The toxicity table has been updated to reflect recent reports indicating that a greater proportion of patients than previously recognized experience persistent CNS symptoms dueto efavirenz and new information about suicidality associated with this drug. Major depression or suicidalthoughts are now specified as psychiatric illnesses warranting cautious use of efavirenz. Explicitrecommendation is made to discontinue efavirenz for severe and/or persistent symptoms when a suitablealternative exists. Nephrotoxic Effects: The toxicity table has been updated to include a section about elevation in serum creatinine with drugs that cause an asymptomatic decrease in renal tubular secretion of creatinine, leadingto an increase in measured serum creatinine in glomerular filtration rate:dolutegravir, rilpivirine. Modifying Antiretroviral Regimens in Children with Sustained Virologic Suppression on Antiretroviral Therapy The Panel has added a new bulleted recommendation to emphasize the need to consider past episodes of ARV treatment failure, tolerability, and all prior drug resistance testing results to avoid choosing new ARVGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection iiidrugs for which archived drug resistance would limit activity. Updated ARV drug information has been incorporated in the text and in Table 14 which provides examples of changes in ARV regimen components that are made for reasons of simplification, convenience, and safety profile in children who have sustained virologic suppression on their current regimen. Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in the Management of Pediatric HIV Infection The Panel has added language about consideration of dose adjustment for efavirenz with a known CYP2B6 poor metabolizer genotype in children older than 3 years. Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information Updates with new pediatric data are provided when relevant to specific drugs. The Panel has added and revisedreferences to websites in each drug section that provide information about drug interactions http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ and HIV resistance mutations http://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf and http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ . With FDA approval of cobicistat tablets, a new heading has been added for drugs classified as Pharmacokinetic Enhancers. Nucleoside Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Zidovudine: The Panel has updated the dosing table to include the dose for continuation of zidovudine after 4 or more weeks based on gestational age. Non-Nucleoside Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Nevirapine: The Panel has provided information about the investigational treatment dose of nevirapine for infants younger than 1 month with a link to the new section, Dosing: Special Considerations: Neonates 14 Days and Premature Infants . Rilpivirine: The panel has updated dosing for adolescents and adults to include switching to rilpivirine in appropriate virologcially-suppressed patients. Protease Inhibitors Atazanavir: In June 2014, the FDA approved the powder formulation of atazanavir for infants and children 3 months and older who weigh at least 10 kg but less than 25 kg. The Panel providesinformation about dosing and administration of atazanavir powder and discusses issues related totransitioning from atazanavir powder to capsules. Because there is no FDA approved atazanavirpowder dose for the child who reaches a weight of 25 kg and cannot swallow pills, the Panel hasprovided information about an experimental dose currently under study for children who weigh 25to <35kg. Information is also provided about the use of cobicistat tablets for boosting atazanavir inadolescents 18 years and older and adults. Information has also been added about administrationand dosing of atazanavir with cobicistat in adolescents and adults. Darunavir: Information has been added about administration and dosing of darunavir with cobicistat in adolescents 18 years and older and adults. Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors Dolutegravir: The Panel has provided information about the investigational dose being used in a clinical trial for treatment-experienced children younger than 12 years. Elvitegravir: A tablet formulation of elvitegravir was FDA approved in September 2014 for adults; it is not approved for children younger than 18 years. The Panel has provided dosingrecommendations for the use of elvitegravir in combination with other ARV drugs. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection ivPharmacokinetic Enhancers Cobicistat: A new section has been added because cobicistat is now available as a tablet and in combination with atazanavir (Evotaz) or darunavir (Prezcobix) as Cobicistat is notinterchangeable specific PI and elvitegravir that requirecobicistat for boosting. Ritonavir: Information about ritonavir has been moved because it is used as a PK enhancer of other PI in children and adults and is no longer recommended as an antiviral agent. In adults,ritonavir is recommended as a PK enhancer for use with the integrase inhibitor elvitegravir, whenused in combination with another PI.

Guidance on management of adverse events associatedwith use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in children and a detailed review of information about safety, efficacy,and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ARV agents in children is also included. The Department of Health andHuman Services (HHS) Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children(the Panel), a working group of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (OARAC), reviews new dataon an ongoing basis and provides regular updates to the guidelines. The guidelines are available on theAIDSinfo website at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov . The AIDSinfo website also includes separate guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-exposed and -infected children,1for the use of ARV agents in HIV-infected (post-pubertal) adolescents and adults,2for the use of ARV drugs in pregnant HIV-infected women,3and for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults.4These guidelines are developed for the United States and may not be applicable in other countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) providesguidelines for resource-limited settings at http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/arv/en . Since the guidelines were first developed in 1993 (with the support of the Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud Center,Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey), advances in medical management have dramatically reducedmorbidity and mortality in HIV-infected children in the United States. Mortality in children with perinatalHIV infection has decreased by more than 80% to 90% since the introduction of protease inhibitor-containing combinations and opportunistic and other related infections in children have significantly declinedin the era of cART. 5,6ARV drug resistance testing has enhanced the ability to choose effective initial and subsequent regimens. Treatment strategies continue to focus on timely initiation of cART regimens capableof maximally suppressing viral replication in order to prevent disease progression, preserve or restoreimmunologic function, and reduce the development of drug resistance. At the same time, availability of newdrugs and drug formulations has led to more potent regimens with lower toxicity, lower pill burdens, and lessfrequent medication administration, all fac tors that can improve adherence and outcomes. The use of ARV drugs in HIV-infected pregnant women has resulted in a dramatic decrease (to less than 2%) in the rate of HIVtransmission to infants in the United States. In addition to decreasing numbers of infants with HIV infection, children in the United States who are HIV-infected are less likely to develop AIDS because of routine and early institution of effective cART.7,8Finally, as a group, children living with HIV infection are growing older, bringing new challenges related to adherence, drug resistance, reproductive health planning, transition to adult medical care, and the potential for long-term complications from HIV and its treatments.9,10 The pathogenesis of HIV infection and the virologic and immunologic principles underlying the use of cARTare generally similar for all HIV-infected individuals, but unique considerations exist for HIV-infectedinfants, children, and adolescents, including: Acquisition of infection through perinatal exposure for most infected children; In utero, intrapartum, and/or postpartum neonatal exposure to ARV drugs in most perinatally infected children; Requirement for use of HIV virologic tests to diagnose perinatal HIV infection in infants younger than 18 months; Age-specific interpretation of CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts; Higher viral loads in perinatally-infected infants than in HIV-infected adolescents and adults; Changes in PK parameters with age caused by the continuing development and maturation of organ systems involved in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and clearance; Differences in the clinical manifestations and treatment of HIV infection secondary to onset of infectionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection A-2in growing, immunologically immature individuals; and Special considerations associated with adherence to ARV treatment in infants, children, and adolescents. The recommendations in these guidelines are based on the current state of knowledge regarding the use of ARV drugs in children. Evidence is drawn primarily from published data regarding the treatment of HIVinfection in infants, children, adolescents, and adults; however, when no such data were available,unpublished data and the clinical expertise of the Panel members were also considered. The Panel intends forthese guidelines to be flexible and not to replace the clinical judgment of experienced health care providers. Guidelines Development Process An outline of the composition of the Panel and the guidelines process can be found in Table 1. Topic Comment Goal of the Guidelines Provide guidance to HIV care practitioners on the optimal use of ARV agents in HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents (through puberty) in the United States. Panel Members The Panel is composed of approximately 32 voting members who have expertise in management of HIVinfection in infants, children, and adolescents. Members include representatives from the Committee onPediatric AIDS of the American Academy of Pediatrics and community representatives with knowledge ofpediatric HIV infection. The Panel also includes at least one representative from each of the following HHSagencies: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), HealthResources and Services Administration (HRSA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Arepresentative from the Canadian Pediatric AIDS Research Group participates as a nonvoting, ex officiomember of the Panel. The U.S. government representatives are appointed by their respective agencies;nongovernmental members are selected after an open announcement to call for nominations. Eachmember serves on the Panel for a 3-year term with an option for reappointment. A list of currentmembers can be found in the Panel Roster . Financial Disclosure All members of the Panel submit a financial disclosure statement in writing annually, reporting anyassociation with manufacturers of ARV drugs or diagnostics used for management of HIV infections. Alist of the latest disclosures is available on the AIDS infowebsite ( http://aidsinfo.nih.gov ). Users of the Guidelines Providers of care to HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents Developer Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children\u2014a working group ofOARAC Funding Source Office of AIDS Research, NIH and Health Resources and Services Administration Evidence Collection A standardized review of recent relevant literature related to each section of the guidelines is performed bya representative of the Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud Center and provided to individual Panel section workinggroups. The recommendations are generally based on studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Onsome occasions, particularly when new information may affect patient safety, unpublished data presentedat major conferences or prepared by the FDA and/or manufacturers as warnings to the public may be usedas evidence to revise the guidelines. RecommendationGrading Described in Table 2 . Method of SynthesizingData Each section of the guidelines is assigned to a small group of Panel members with expertise in the area ofinterest. The members synthesize the available data and propose recommendations to the Panel. ThePanel discusses and votes on all proposals during monthly teleconferences. Proposals endorsed by aconsensus of members are included in the guidelines as official Panel recommendations.Table 1.

For more detailed discussion of issues of treatment of postpubertal adolescents, the Panel defers to the designatedexpertise offered by the Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents. Separate guidelines outline the use of cART in HIV-infected pregnant women and interventions for prevention of perinatal transmission, cART for nonpregnant HIV-infected adults and postpubertaladolescents, and ARV prophylaxis for those who experience occupational or nonoccupational exposure toHIV. These guidelines are also available on the AIDS infowebsite ( http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov ). Update Plan The full Panel meets monthly by teleconference to review data that may warrant modification of theguidelines. Smaller working groups of Panel members hold additional teleconferences to review individualdrug sections or other specific topics (e.g., What to Start). Updates may be prompted by new drugapprovals (or new indications, formulations, or frequency of dosing), new significant safety or efficacydata, or other information that may have a significant impact on the clinical care of patients. In the eventof significant new data that may affect patient safety, the Panel may issue a warning announcement andpost accompanying recommendations on the AIDS infowebsite until the guidelines can be updated with appropriate changes. All sections of the guidelines will be reviewed, with updates as appropriate, at leastonce yearly. Public Comments A 2-week public comment period follows release of the updated guidelines on the AIDS infowebsite. The Panel reviews comments received to determine whether additional revisions to the guidelines areindicated. The public may also submit comments to the Panel at any time at contactus@aidsinfo.nih.gov .Table 1. Outline of the Guidelines Development Process (page 2 of 2) Basis for Recommendations Recommendations in these guidelines are based upon scientific evidence and expert opinion. Each recommendation includes a letter ( A, B, or C) that represents the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral (I, II, or III) that represents the quality of the evidence that supports the recommendation. Because licensure of drugs in children often is based on efficacy data from adult trials in addition to safety and PK data from studies in children, recommendations for ARV drugs may need to rely, in part, on datafrom clinical trials or studies in adults. Pediatric drug approval may be based on evidence from adequate andwell-controlled investigations in adults if: 1. The course of the disease and the effects of the drug in the pediatric and adult populations are expected to be similar enough to permit extrapolation of adult efficacy data to pediatric patients; 2. Supplemental data exist on PKs of the drug in children indicating that systemic exposure in adults and children are similar; and 3. Studies are provided that support the safety of the drug in pediatric patients. 11 Studies relating activity of the drug-to-drug levels (pharmacodynamic data) in children also should be available if there is a concern that concentration-response relationships might be different in children. Inmany cases, evidence related to use of ARV drugs is substantially greater from adult studies (especiallyrandomized clinical trials) than from pediatric studies. Therefore, for pediatric recommendations, thefollowing rationale has been used when the quality of evidence from pediatric studies is limited: Quality of Evidence Rating I\u2014Randomized Clinical Trial Data Quality of Evidence Rating I will be used if there are data from large randomized trials in children with clinical and/or validated laboratory endpoints. Quality of Evidence Rating I* will be used if there are high-quality randomized clinical trial data in adults with clinical and/or validated laboratory endpoints and pediatric data from well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes that are consistent with the adult studies. A rating of I* may be used for quality of evidence if, for example, a randomizedGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection A-4Phase III clinical trial in adults demonstrates a drug is effective in ARV-naive patients and data from a nonrandomized pediatric trial demonstrate adequate and consistent safety and PK data in the pediatricpopulation. Quality of Evidence Rating II\u2014Nonrandomized Clinical Trials or Observational Cohort Data Quality of Evidence Rating II will be used if there are data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohorts in children . Quality of Evidence Rating II* will be used if there are well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in adults with supporting and consistent information from smaller nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data in children. A rating of II* may be used for quality of evidence if, for example, a large observational study in adults demonstrates clinical benefitto initiating treatment at a certain CD4 cell count and data from smaller observational studies in childrenindicate that a similar CD4 cell count is associated with clinical benefit. Quality of Evidence Rating III\u2014Expert opinion The criteria do not differ for adults and children. In an effort to increase the amount and improve the quality of evidence available for guiding management of HIV infection in children, the discussion of available trials with children and their caregivers is encouraged.Information about clinical trials for HIV-infected adults and children can be obtained from the AIDS info website (http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/ClinicalTrials/ ) or by telephone at 1-800-448-0440.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection B-1Identification of Perinatal HIV Exposure (Last updated March 5, 2015; last reviewed March 5, 2015) HIV infection should be identified prior to pregnancy or as early in pregnancy as possible. This provides the best opportunity to prevent infant HIV infection and to identify and start therapy as soon as possible ininfants who become infected. Universal HIV counseling and voluntary HIV testing are recommended as thestandard of care for all pregnant women in the United States by The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy andMedical Management of HIV-Infected Children (the Panel), the U.S. Public Health Service, the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the U.S. PreventiveServices Task Force. 1-6All HIV testing should be performed in a manner consistent with state and local laws (http://nccc.ucsf.edu/clinical-resources/hiv-aids-resources/state-hiv-testing-laws/ ). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the \"opt-out\" approach, which involves notifying pregnantwomen that HIV testing will be performed as part of routine care unless they choose not to be tested for HIV .The \"opt-in\" approach involves obtaining specific consent before testing and has been associated with lowertesting rates. 7,8The mandatory newborn HIV testing approach, adopted by several states, involves testing of newborns for perinatal HIV exposure with or without maternal consent, if prenatal or intrapartum maternaltesting is not performed. Early identification of HIV-infected women is crucial for their health and for the care of their children, whether the children are infected or not. Knowledge of antenatal maternal HIV infection enables:Panel's Recommendations HIV testing early in pregnancy is recommended as standard of care for all pregnant women in the United States (AII). Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester, before 36 weeks' gestation, should be considered for all HIV-seronegative pregnant women and is recommended for pregnant women who are at high risk of HIV infection (AIII). Rapid or expedited HIV testing at the time of labor or delivery should be performed on women with undocumented HIV status; if results are positive, intrapartum and infant postnatal antiretroviral prophylaxis should be initiated immediately, pending results of the confirmatory HIV antibody test (AII). Women who have not been tested for HIV before or during labor should undergo rapid or expedited HIV antibody testing during the immediate postpartum period or their newborns should undergo rapid HIV antibody testing. If results in mother or infant arepositive, infant antiretroviral prophylaxis should be initiated immediately and the mothers should not breastfeed unlessconfirmatory HIV antibody testing is negative (AII). In infants with initial positive HIV viral tests (RNA, DNA), prophylaxis shouldbe stopped and antiretroviral treatment initiated. For HIV-seronegative women in whom acute HIV infection is suspected during pregnancy, intrapartum, or while breastfeeding, a virologic test (e.g., plasma HIV RNA assay, antigen/antibody combination immunoassay) should be performed because serologictesting may be negative at this early stage of infection (AII). Results of maternal HIV testing should be documented in the newborn's medical record and communicated to the newborn's primary care provider (AIII). Infant HIV antibody testing to determine HIV exposure should be considered for infants in foster care and adoptees for whom maternal HIV infection status is unknown (AIII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection B-2 HIV-infected women to receive appropriate combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections for their own health, which may also decrease risk of transmission to their partners.2,9,10 Provision of cART to the mother during pregnancy and labor, and antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis to the newborn to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV transmission;4 Counseling of HIV-infected women about the indications for (and potential benefits of) scheduled elective cesarean delivery to reduce perinatal transmission of HIV;4,11-13 Counseling of HIV-infected women about the risks of HIV transmission through breast milk (breastfeeding is not recommended for HIV-infected women living in the United States and othercountries where safe alternatives to breast milk are available); 14 Initiation of prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia beginning at age 4 to 6 weeks in all HIV-infected infants and in those HIV-exposed infants whose HIV infection status remainsindeterminate; 15and Early diagnostic evaluation of HIV-exposed infants, as well as testing of partners and other children, to permit prompt initiation of cART in infected individuals.1,16 Repeat HIV Testing in the Third Trimester Repeat HIV testing should be considered for all HIV-seronegative pregnant women. A second HIV testduring the third trimester, before 36 weeks' gestation, is recommended 4,17for women who: Are receiving health care in a jurisdiction that has a high incidence of HIV or AIDS in women between ages 15 and 45, or are receiving health care in facilities in which prenatal screening identifies at least 1HIV-infected pregnant woman per 1,000 women screened (a list of areas where such screening isrecommended is found in the 2006 CDC recommendations ); Are known to be at high risk of acquiring HIV (e.g., those who are injection drug users or partners of injection drug users, exchange sex for money or drugs, are sex partners of HIV-infected individuals, havehad a new or more than one sex partner during current pregnancy, or have been diagnosed with a newsexually transmitted disease during pregnancy); or Have signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection. 2,3,18,19 Women who decline testing earlier in pregnancy should be offered testing again during the third trimester. Ifacute HIV infection is a possibility, virologic testing with a plasma HIV RNA assay or, if unavailable, anantigen/antibody combination immunoassay, should be performed because serologic testing may be negativeat this early stage of infection. 20 Rapid HIV Testing During Labor in Women with Unknown HIV Status Use of rapid test kits or an expedited immunoassay to detect HIV infection is recommended to screen womenin labor whose HIV status is undocumented and to identify HIV exposure in their infants. 1-3,5,16Any hospital offering intrapartum care should have rapid or expedited HIV testing available and should have policies andprocedures in place to ensure that staff are prepared to provide patient education about rapid or expeditedHIV testing, that results are available ideally within 1 hour, that appropriate ARV medications are availablewhenever needed, and that follow-up procedures are in place for women found to be HIV-infected and theirinfants. Rapid tests have been found to be feasible, accurate, timely, and useful both in ensuring promptinitiation of intrapartum and neonatal ARV prophylaxis and in reducing perinatal transmission of HIV . 21 Results of rapid tests can be obtained within minutes to a few hours with accuracy comparable to standardenzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (EIA). 5,22,23A single negative rapid test does not need confirmation unless acute HIV infection is a possibility, in which case, a virologic test is necessary.20A positive rapid HIV test result must be followed by a supplemental test to confirm the presence of HIV infection.23However,Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection B-3immediate initiation of ARV prophylaxis for prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV is strongly recommended pending confirmation of an initial positive rapid HIV test.1,4,6,16 HIV Counseling and Testing During the Postnatal Period Women who have not been tested for HIV before or during labor should be offered rapid or expedited testingduring the immediate postpartum period or their newborns should undergo rapid or expedited HIV testingwith maternal consent (unless state law allows testing without consent). 1,3,4,16Use of rapid or expedited HIV assays or expedited EIA for prompt identification of HIV-exposed infants is essential because neonatal ARVprophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible after birth\u2014ideally no more than 6 to 12 hours afterbirth\u2014to be effective for the prevention of perinatal transmission. When an initial HIV test is positive inmother or infant, initiation of infant ARV prophylaxis and counseling against initiation of breastfeeding isstrongly recommended pending results of confirmatory HIV tests. 4If confirmatory tests are negative and acute HIV infection is excluded, infant ARV prophylaxis can be discontinued. In the absence of ongoingmaternal HIV exposure, breastfeeding can be initiated. Mechanisms should be developed to facilitate HIVscreening for infants who have been abandoned and are in the custody of the state. Infant HIV Testing when Maternal HIV Test Results Are Unavailable When maternal HIV test results are unavailable (e.g., for infants who are in foster care) or their accuracycannot be evaluated (e.g., for infants adopted from a country where results are not reported in English), HIVantibody testing is indicated to identify HIV exposure in those infants. 1If antibody testing is positive, further testing is needed to diagnose HIV infection, or in the case of infants older than 18 months, to confirm HIVinfection (see Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants ). Acute Maternal HIV Infection During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding The risk of perinatal transmission of HIV is increased in infants born to women who have acute HIVinfection during pregnancy or lactation. 17,24-27When acute retroviral syndrome is a possibility in pregnancy or during breastfeeding, maternal testing should include a combination antigen/antibody immunoassay orplasma HIV RNA test, because HIV antibody testing may be negative in early maternal infection. Womenwith possible acute HIV infection who are breastfeeding should stop breastfeeding immediately until HIVinfection is confirmed or excluded. 14Pumping and temporarily discarding breast milk can be recommended and (if HIV infection is excluded), in the absence of ongoing maternal exposure to HIV , breastfeeding canresume. Care of pregnant or breastfeeding women identified with acute or early HIV infection, and theirinfants, should follow the recommendations in the Perinatal Guidelines .4 Surveillance Reporting of HIV-Exposed Infants to Local and State Health Departments Clinicians should be aware of public health surveillance systems and exposed-infant reporting regulations that may exist in their jurisdictions; this is in addition to mandatory reporting of HIV-infected persons,including infants. Reporting cases allows for appropriate public health functions to be accomplished. References 1. American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Pediatric AIDS.

Tests for antibodies toHIV , including newer tests, do not establish the presence of HIV infection in infants because oftransplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to HIV; therefore, a virologic test should be used. 1,2Positive virologic tests (i.e., nucleic acid tests [NAT]\u2014a class of tests that includes HIV DNA and RNA polymerasechain reaction [PCR] assays, and related RNA qualitative or quantitative assays) indicate likely HIVinfection. The first test result should be confirmed as soon as possible by a repeat virologic test on a secondspecimen because false-positive results can occur with both RNA and DNA assays. HIV culture is not used for routine HIV diagnostic testing. 3It is more complex and expensive to perform than DNA PCR or RNA assays, requires 2 to 4 weeks for definitive results, and is generally not available outside of research laboratories. Use of the currently approved HIV p24 antigen assay is not recommendedPanel's Recommendations Virologic assays that directly detect HIV must be used to diagnose HIV infection in infants younger than 18 months; antibody tests should not be used (AII). HIV RNA and HIV DNA nucleic acid tests (NATs) are recommended as preferred virologic assays (AII). Virologic diagnostic testing in infants with known perinatal HIV exposure is recommended at ages 14 to 21 days, 1 to 2 months, and 4 to 6 months (AII). Virologic diagnostic testing at birth should be considered for infants at high risk of HIV infection (AIII). Virologic diagnostic testing should be considered 2 to 4 weeks after cessation of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis for infants receiving combination ARV infant prophylaxis, if the results of prior virologic testing were negative while the infant was receiving prophylaxis (BIII). A positive virologic test should be confirmed as soon as possible by a repeat virologic test on a second specimen (AII). Definitive exclusion of HIV infection in non-breastfed infants is based on two or more negative virologic tests, with one obtained at age 1 month and one at age 4 months, or two negative HIV antibody tests from separate specimens obtained at age 6 months (AII). Some experts confirm the absence of HIV infection at 12 to 18 months of age in infants with prior negative virologic tests by performing an antibody test to document loss of maternal HIV antibodies (BIII). Children with perinatal HIV exposure aged 18 to 24 months may have residual maternal HIV antibodies; definitive exclusion or confirmation of HIV infection in children in this age group who are HIV antibody-positive should be based on a NAT (seeDiagnostic Testing in Children with Perinatal HIV Exposure in Special Situations ) (AII). Diagnosis of HIV infection in children with non-perinatal exposure or children with perinatal exposure aged >24 months relies primarily on the use of HIV antibody tests; when acute HIV infection is suspected, testing with an HIV NAT may be necessary todiagnose HIV infection (AII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-2for infant diagnosis in the United States because the sensitivity and specificity of the assay in the first months of life are less than that of other HIV virologic tests.4,5 Infants who are found to have positive HIV antibody tests but whose mothers' HIV status is unknown (seeIdentification of Perinatal HIV Exposure ) should be assumed to be HIV-exposed and undergo the HIV diagnostic testing described here.6 HIV DNA PCR HIV DNA PCR is a sensitive technique used to detect specific HIV viral DNA in peripheral bloodmononuclear cells. The specificity of the HIV DNA PCR is 99.8% at birth and 100% at ages 1, 3, and 6months. The sensitivity of the test performed at birth is 55% but increases to more than 90% by 2 to 4 weeksof age and to 100% at ages 3 months and 6 months. 6-9Although, the AMPLICOR\u00aeHIV-1 DNA test has been widely used for diagnosis of infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers since it was introduced in 1992, it is nolonger commercially available in the United States. The sensitivity and specificity of non-commercial HIV-1DNA tests (using individual laboratory reagents) may differ from the sensitivity and specificity of the Foodand Drug Administration (FDA)-approved commercial test. HIV RNA Assays HIV quantitative RNA assays detect extracellular viral RNA in the plasma. Their specificity (for results5,000 copies/mL) has been shown to be 100% at birth and at 1, 3, and 6 months of age and is comparable toHIV DNA PCR. 8HIV RNA levels <5,000 copies/mL may not be reproducible and should be repeated before they are interpreted as documenting HIV infection in an infant. The sensitivity of HIV RNA assays has beenshown to be 25% to 58% during the first weeks of life, 89% at age 1 month, and 90% to 100% by age 2 to 3months. 6-8HIV RNA assays were found to be as sensitive as HIV DNA PCR for early diagnosis of HIV infection in HIV-exposed infants regardless of receipt of infant zidovudine prophylaxis.6,8 An HIV RNA assay can be used as the supplemental test for infants who have an initial positive HIV DNAPCR test. In addition to providing virologic confirmation of infection status, the expense of repeat HIV DNAPCR testing is spared and an HIV RNA measurement is available to assess baseline viral load. HIV RNAassays may be more sensitive than HIV DNA PCR for detecting HIV non-subtype B (see Issues Related toDiagnosis of Group M Non-Subtype B and Group O HIV-1 Infections). While HIV DNA PCR remains positive in most individuals receiving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, HIV RNA assays could potentially be affected by maternal antenatal treatment or infant combination ARVprophylaxis. 8,10However, in one study, the sensitivity of HIV RNA assays was not associated with the type of maternal or infant ARV prophylaxis, but HIV RNA levels at 1 month were significantly lower in infantsreceiving multidrug prophylaxis (n = 9) compared to levels among infected infants receiving single-drugzidovudine prophylaxis (n = 47) (median HIV RNA 2.5 log copies/mL vs. 5.4 log copies/mL, respectively).In contrast, the median HIV RNA levels were high (median HIV RNA 5.6 log copies/mL) by age 3 months inboth groups after stopping prophylaxis. 8Further studies are necessary to evaluate the sensitivity of HIV RNA assays during and after receipt of combination infant ARV prophylaxis. The HIV qualitative RNA assay (APTIMA HIV-1 RNA Qualitative Assay) is an alternative diagnostic test that can be used for infant testing. It is the only qualitative RNA test that is FDA-approved.9,11-15 Issues Related to Diagnosis of Group M Non-Subtype B and Group O HIV-1 Infections Although HIV-1 Group M subtype B is the predominant viral subtype found in the United States, non-subtype B viruses predominate in other parts of the world, such as subtype C in regions of Africa and India and subtypeCRF01 in much of Southeast Asia. Group O HIV strains are seen in West-Central Africa. Non-subtype B and Group O strains may also be seen in countries with links to these geographical regions.16-19Geographical distribution of HIV groups is available at http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/components/sequence/HIV/geo/geo.comp . Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-3HIV DNA PCR tests have decreased sensitivity for detection of non-subtype B HIV , and false-negative HIV DNA PCR test results have been reported in infants infected with non-subtype B HIV .20-22In an evaluation of perinatally infected infants diagnosed in New York State in 2001 through 2002, 16.7% of infants were infected with a non-subtype B strain of HIV , compared with 4.4% of infants diagnosed between 1998 and 1999.23 Currently available real-time HIV RNA PCR assays and the qualitative RNA assay have improved sensitivityfor detection of non-subtype B HIV infection and the more uncommon Group O strains, compared to otherRNA assays that do not detect or properly quantify all non-B subtypes and Group O HIV 24-29(see HIV RNA Monitoring in Children: General Considerations in Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring ). When evaluating an infant whose mother's HIV transmission risk is linked to an area endemic for non-subtype B HIV or Group O strains, such as Africa or Southeast Asia, clinicians should consider conductinginitial testing using one of the assays more sensitive for non-subtype B viruses, such as one of the real-timePCR assays or the qualitative RNA assay. In addition, when non-subtype B perinatal exposure is suspected ininfants with negative HIV DNA PCR results, repeat testing using one of the newer RNA assays isrecommended. The child should undergo close clinical monitoring and HIV serologic testing at age 18months to definitively rule out HIV infection. Clinicians should consult with an expert in pediatric HIVinfection; state or local public health departments or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)may be able to assist in obtaining referrals for diagnostic testing. Issues Related to Diagnosis of HIV-2 Infections HIV-2 infection is endemic in Angola; Mozambique; West African countries including Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome, Senegal, and Togo; and parts of India.30,31It also occurs in countries such as France and Portugal, which have large numbers of immigrants from these regions;32,33HIV-2 is rare in the United States. HIV-2 infection should be suspected in pregnant women who are from\u2014or who have partners from\u2014countries in which the disease is endemic, who are HIV-1 antibody-positive on an initial immunoassaytest, and who have repeatedly indeterminate results on HIV-1 Western blot and HIV-1 RNA viral loads at orbelow the limit of detection. 34,35This pattern of HIV testing can also be seen in patients who have a false- positive HIV antibody test. HIV-1 and HIV-2 coinfections may also occur but are rare outside areas whereHIV-2 is endemic. Although accurate diagnosis of HIV-2 can be problematic, it is clinically important becauseHIV-2 strains are naturally resistant to several ARV drugs developed to suppress HIV-1. 36 The majority of commercially available HIV screening antibody tests can detect both HIV-1 and HIV-2 but donot distinguish between the two viruses. More than 60% of individuals with HIV-2 infection are misclassifiedas having HIV-1 by the HIV-1 Western blot. The only FDA-approved antibody test that distinguishes betweenHIV-1 and HIV-2 is the Bio-Rad Laboratories Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 rapid test which, in the United States, isbeing used increasingly as a supplemental test instead of the Western blot. All HIV-2 cases should be reportedto the HIV surveillance program of the state or local health department, which can arrange for additionalconfirmatory testing for HIV-2 by their public health laboratory or the CDC. Confirmatory testing for HIV-2infection uses an HIV-2 nucleic acid test. HIV-2 RNA is undetectable in at least half of HIV-2-infected persons;thus, tests for HIV-2 proviral DNA may be necessary for definitive diagnosis. 37-39 Infants born to HIV-2-infected mothers should be tested for HIV-2 infection with HIV-2-specific virologicassays (HIV-2 DNA PCR testing) at time points similar to those used for HIV-1 testing. HIV-2 virologicassays are not commercially available, but the National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765) can providea list of sites that perform this testing. Clinicians should consult with an expert in pediatric HIV infectionwhen caring for infants with suspected or known exposure to HIV-2. 30,40,41 Timing of Diagnostic Testing in Infants with Known Perinatal HIV Exposure Virologic diagnostic testing of an HIV-exposed infant should be performed at age 14 to 21 days, at age 1 to 2months, and at age 4 to 6 months. Virologic diagnostic testing should be considered at birth for infants atGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-4high risk of HIV infection and 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of prophylaxis for infants receiving combination neonatal ARV regimens (see below). Confirmation of HIV infection should be based on two positive virologic tests from separate blood samples, regardless of a child's age. A positive HIV antibody test with supplemental Western blot (or immunofluorescentantibody [IF A] assay) at age 18 months generally confirms HIV infection; exceptions include late seroreverters (see Diagnostic Testing in Children with Perinatal HIV Exposure in Special Situations ).1 HIV infection can be presumptively excluded in non-breastfed infants with two or more negative virologic tests (one at age 14 days and one at age 4 weeks) or one negative virologic test (i.e., negative NAT [RNAor DNA]) test at age 8 weeks, or one negative HIV antibody test at age 6 months. 1,6Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for infants with indeterminate HIV infection status starting atage 4 to 6 weeks until they are determined to be HIV-uninfected or presumptively uninfected.42Thus, initiation of PCP prophylaxis can be avoided or discontinued if an infant has negative virologic tests at ages2 weeks and 4 weeks, or if virologic testing is negative at age 8 weeks. Definitive exclusion of HIV infection in a non-breastfed infant is based on two or more negative virologic tests (i.e., negative NATs [RNA or DNA]), one at age 1 month and one at age 4 months, or two negative HIVantibody tests from separate specimens obtained at age 6 months. For both presumptive and definitive exclusion of HIV infection, a child must have no other laboratory (i.e., no positive virologic test results or lowCD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] cell count/percent) or clinical evidence of HIV infection and not be breastfeeding.Many experts confirm the absence of HIV infection in infants with negative virologic tests by performing anantibody test at age 12 to 18 months to document seroreversion to HIV antibody-negative status. Virologic Testing at Birth (Optional) Virologic testing at birth should be considered for newborns at high risk of perinatal HIV transmission, suchas infants born to HIV-infected mothers who did not receive prenatal care or prenatal ARVs, were diagnosedwith acute HIV infection during pregnancy, or who had HIV viral loads >1,000 copies/mL close to the timeof delivery. 43,44As many as 30% to 40% of HIV-infected infants can be identified by age 48 hours.6Prompt diagnosis is critical to allow for discontinuing ARV prophylaxis and instituting early ARV therapy (see When to Initiate Therapy ). Blood samples from the umbilical cord should not be used for diagnostic evaluations because of the potential for contamination with maternal blood. Working definitions have been proposed todifferentiate acquisition of HIV infection in utero from the intrapartum period. Infants who have a positive virologic test at or before age 48 hours are considered to have early (i.e., intrauterine) infection, whereasinfants who have a negative virologic test during the first week of life and subsequent positive tests areconsidered to have late (i.e., intrapartum) infection. 44-46 Virologic Testing at Age 14 to 21 Days The diagnostic sensitivity of virologic testing increases rapidly by age 2 weeks,6and early identification of infection would permit discontinuation of neonatal ARV prophylaxis and initiation of ARV therapy (seeInfants Younger than Age 12 Months and Table 5 in When to Initiate Therapy ). Virologic Testing at Age 1 to 2 Months Infants with negative virologic tests before age 1 month should be retested at age 1 to 2 months. Most HIV-exposed neonates will receive 6 weeks of neonatal ARV prophylaxis. the use of antepartum,intrapartum, and neonatal zidovudine single-drug prophylaxis did not delay detection of HIV by culture ininfants in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 076 or affect the sensitivity and predictive values ofmany virologic assays, 6,47,48this may not always apply to current combination prenatal and neonatal ARV regimens if the test is obtained while the infant is receiving combination neonatal ARV prophylaxis.8 Virologic diagnostic testing for infants receiving combination ARV infant prophylaxis should be considered2 to 4 weeks after cessation of prophylaxis if prior negative diagnostic testing was performed during theGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-5period of prophylaxis. In such situations, the test recommended at age 1 to 2 months can be delayed until after cessation of ARV prophylaxis. An infant with two negative virologic tests, one at age 14 days and one at age 1 month, can be viewed as presumptively uninfected and will not need PCP prophylaxis, assuming the child has not had a positive virologic test, CD4 immunosuppression, or clinical evidence of HIV infection. Virologic Testing at Age 4 to 6 Months HIV-exposed children who have had negative virologic assays at age 14 to 21 days and at age 1 to 2 months,have no clinical evidence of HIV infection, and are not breastfed should be retested at age 4 to 6 months fordefinitive exclusion of HIV infection. Antibody Testing at Age 6 Months and Older Two or more negative HIV antibody tests performed in non-breastfed infants at age 6 months can also beused to definitively exclude HIV infection in HIV-exposed children with no clinical or virologic laboratory evidence of HIV infection. Antibody Testing at Age 12 to 18 Months to Document Seroreversion Some experts confirm the absence of HIV infection in infants with negative virologic tests (when there has not been prior confirmation of two negative antibody tests) by repeat serologic testing between 12 and 18 monthsof age to confirm that maternal HIV antibodies transferred in utero have disappeared.1In a recent study, the median age at seroreversion was 13.9 months.49Although the majority of HIV-uninfected infants will serorevert by age 15 to 18 months, there are reports of late seroreversion after 18 months (see below). Factors that might influence the time to seroreversion include maternal disease stage and assay sensitivity.49-52 Diagnostic Testing in Children with Perinatal HIV Exposure in Special Situations Late Seroreversion up to Age 24 Months Non-breastfed, perinatally HIV-exposed infants with no other HIV transmission risk and no clinical or virologic laboratory evidence of HIV infection may have residual HIV antibodies up to age 24 months (theseinfants are called late seroreverters). 50,52-54In one study, 14% seroreverted after age 18 months.49These children may have positive immunoassay results but indeterminate supplemental antibody tests (usingWestern blot or IFA). In such cases, repeat antibody testing at a later time would document seroreversion.Due to the possibility of residual HIV antibodies, virologic testing (i.e., with a NAT) will be necessary todefinitively exclude or confirm HIV infection in children with perinatal HIV exposure at age 18 to 24 monthsin situations such as lack of prior testing history or clinical suspicion of HIV infection. Postnatal HIV Infection in HIV-Exposed Children with Prior Negative Virologic Tests for Whom There Are Additional HIV Transmission Risks In contrast to late seroreverters, in rare situations postnatal HIV infections have been reported in HIV- exposed infants who had prior negative HIV virologic tests. This occurs in infants who become infectedthrough an additional risk after completion of testing (see Diagnostic Testing in Children with Non-Perinatal HIV Exposure or Children with Perinatal Exposure Aged >24 Months ). If an HIV antibody test is positive at age 18 to 24 months, repeated virologic testing will distinguish between residual antibodies in uninfected,late-seroreverting children and true infection. Suspicion of HIV-2 or Non-Subtype B HIV-1 Infections with False-Negative Virologic Test Results Children with non-subtype B HIV-1 infection and children with HIV-2 infection may have false-negative virologic tests but persistent positive immunossay results and indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot results. 20-22 The diagnostic approach in these situations is discussed above in the sections in Issues Related to DiagnosisGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection C-6of Group M Non-Subtype B and Group O HIV-1 Infections and in Issues Related to Diagnosis of HIV-2 Infections. Diagnostic Testing in Children with Non-Perinatal HIV Exposure or Children with Perinatal Exposure Aged >24 Months Breastfeeding is a known route of postnatal HIV transmission. Typical scenarios in the United States include women who have not been adequately counseled about infant feeding, women who breastfeed despite beingcounseled not to do so (this may occur among women from communities where breastfeeding is the normand/or in women who fear that not breastfeeding would be a stigma or would reveal their HIV status), andwomen who learn of their HIV diagnosis only after initiating breastfeeding (such as women who were HIVnegative during pregnancy but who acquire HIV infection postnatally; breastfeeding during acute HIVinfection is associated with an increased risk of perinatal HIV transmission). 55-57Donor breast milk from an unscreened HIV-infected donor is an additional potential risk factor. Diagnostic testing to rule out acquisitionof HIV through breast milk will only be accurate after breastfeeding has completely ceased. Infants who arebreastfed by HIV-infected women should undergo immediate age-appropriate HIV diagnostic testing, andbreastfeeding should be discontinued. Follow-up testing should be performed at 4 to 6 weeks, 3 months, and6 months after breastfeeding cessation if the initial tests are negative. 58,59HIV antibody testing of an infant to assess for HIV exposure would not be helpful if the mother acquired HIV infection after giving birth. In thatsituation, an infant would be HIV antibody-negative but still at risk of acquiring HIV infection throughbreastfeeding, and counseling to cease breastfeeding should be provided. Receipt of solid food premasticated or prechewed by an HIV-infected caregiver has been documented to be associated with risk of HIV transmission. 53,54,60-63If this occurs in perinatally HIV-exposed infants 24 months or younger with prior negative virologic tests, it will be necessary for such children to undergo virologicdiagnostic testing, as they may have residual maternal HIV antibody (see Diagnostic Testing in Children with Perinatal HIV Exposure in Special Situations ). Additional routes of HIV transmission in children include sexual abuse or receipt of contaminated bloodproducts (which occurs in countries in which parenteral exposure to HIV via contaminated blood products isa possibility). In such cases, maternal HIV status may be negative or unknown. Acquisition of HIV is possible through accidental needlesticks or behavioral risks, such as sexual activity or injection drug use in older children. Medical procedures performed in settings with inadequate infectioncontrol practices may pose a potential risk; although tattooing or body piercing presents a potential risk ofHIV transmission, no cases of HIV transmission from these activities have been documented. 64 Diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in children with non-perinatal exposure or children with perinatal exposureaged >24 months relies primarily on HIV antibody tests. 1FDA-approved diagnostic tests include: Antigen/antibody combination immunoassays (fourth-generation tests) that detect HIV-1/2 antibodies as well as HIV-1 p24 antigen: Recommended for initial testing HIV-1/2 immunoassays (third-generation antibody tests): Alternative for initial testing HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 antibodies from HIV-2 antibodies (Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 test): Recommended for supplemental testing HIV-1 Western blot and HIV-1 indirect IFAs (first-generation tests): Alternative for supplemental testing HIV-1 NAT (HIV qualitative RNA assay) If acute HIV infection or end-stage AIDS is suspected, virologic testing may be necessary to diagnose HIV infection because HIV-1/2 antibody immunoassays, HIV-1 Western blot, or HIV-1 IFA may be negative inthese situations.

In particular, normal ranges and the value of CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration (viralload) for prediction of risk of disease progression vary significantly by age. This section will addressimmunologic, virologic, and general laboratory monitoring as well as clinical monitoring of HIV-infectedchildren, relevant to both those who are and are not receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Immunologic Monitoring in Children: General Considerations Clinicians interpreting CD4 cell count and percentage in children must consider age as a factor. CD4 cellcount and percentage values in healthy infants who are HIV-uninfected are considerably higher than valuesobserved in uninfected adults (and slowly decline to adult values by age 5 years). 1,2In children younger than age 5 years, the absolute CD4 cell count tends to vary more with age than does CD4 percentage. Therefore,in HIV-infected children younger than age 5 years, CD4 percentage has historically been preferred formonitoring immune status, whereas absolute CD4 cell count has been the preferred option for children aged5 years. 3-5An analysis from the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study (HPPMCS) found that CD4 percentage provided little or no additional prognostic value compared with CD4 cell countregarding short-term disease progression in children aged <5 years as well as in older children. 6Current pediatric HIV classification and thresholds for treatment initiation are based on absolute CD4 cell count (seeWhen to Initiate ).7 In HIV-infected children, as in infected adults, the CD4 cell count and percentage decline as HIV infectionprogresses; patients with lower CD4 cell count/percentage values have a poorer prognosis than patients withPanel's Recommendations Absolute CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count is recommended for monitoring immune status in children of all ages, with CD4 percentage as an alternative (AII). CD4 cell count/percentage and plasma HIV RNA (viral load) should be measured at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection and at least every 3 to 4 months thereafter for children not on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (AIII). More frequent CD4 cell count and plasma viral load monitoring should be implemented in children with suspected clinical, immunologic, or virologic deterioration or to confirm an abnormal value (AIII). After initiation of cART (or after a change in cART regimen), children should be evaluated for clinical side effects and to support treatment adherence within 1 to 2 weeks, with laboratory testing for toxicity and viral load response recommended at 2 to 4 weeks after treatment initiation (AIII). Children on cART should have therapy adherence, effectiveness (by CD4 cell count/percentage and plasma viral load), and toxicities (by history, physical, and selected laboratory tests) routinely assessed every 3 to 4 months (AII*) . CD4 cell count/percentage can be monitored less frequently (every 6-12 months) in children and youth who are adherent to therapy and have CD4 cell value well above the threshold for opportunistic infection risk, sustained viral suppression, and stableclinical status for more than 2 to 3 years (BII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-2higher values (see Tables A-C in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ). The prognostic value of CD4 cell count and percentage and plasma viral load was assessed in a large individual patient meta-analysis (HPPMCS), which incorporated clinical and laboratory data from 17pediatric studies and included 3,941 HIV-infected children receiving either no therapy or only zidovudinemonotherapy. 4The analysis looked at the short-term (12-month) risk of developing AIDS or dying based on a child's age and selected values of CD4 cell count or percentage and plasma viral load at baseline (see FiguresA and B and Table A in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ). In a separate analysis of this dataset, predictive value of CD4 cell count for risk of death or AIDS/death in HIV-infected children aged 5 years orolder was similar to that observed in young adults, with an increase in the risk of mortality when CD4 cellcount fell below 350 cells/mm 3(see Figure C and Table B in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ).3,8 The risk of disease progression associated with a specific CD4 cell count or percentage varies with the age ofthe child. Infants in the first year of life experience higher risks of progression or death than older childrenfor any given CD4 stratum. For example, comparing a 1-year-old child with a CD4 percentage of 25% to a 5-year-old child with the same CD4 percentage, there is an approximately fourfold increase in the risk of AIDSand sixfold increase in the risk of death in the 1-year-old child (see Figures A and B in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ). Children aged 5 years or older have a lower risk of progression than younger children, with the increase in risk of AIDS or death corresponding to CD4 cell count more similar to those inyoung adults (see Figure C and Table B in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ). In the HPPMCS, there were no deaths among children aged 5 years or older with CD4 cell count >350 cells/mm3, although in younger children there continued to be a significant risk of death even with CD4 cell count >500 cells/mm3 (see Table B in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ). These risk profiles contribute to the rationale for recommendations on when to initiate therapy in a treatment-naive HIV-infected child (see When to Initiate ). A website using the meta-analysis from the HPPMCS is available to estimate the short-term risk of progression to AIDS or death in the absence of effective cARTaccording to age and the most recent CD4 percentage/absolute CD4 cell count or HIV-1 RNA viral loadmeasurement (http://hppmcs.org ).4 Measurement of CD4 cell count and percentage can be associated with considerable intrapatient variation.5 Mild intercurrent illness, the receipt of vaccinations, or exercise can produce a transient decrease in CD4 cellcount and percentage; thus, CD4 cell count/percentage are best measured when patients are clinically stable.No decision about therapy should be made in response to a change in CD4 cell count/percentage until thechange has been substantiated by at least a second determination, with a minimum of 1 week betweenmeasurements. HIV RNA Monitoring in Children: General Considerations Quantitative HIV-1 RNA assays measure the plasma concentration of HIV RNA as copies/mL, commonlyreferred to as the plasma viral load. During the period of primary infection in adults and adolescents, in theabsence of therapy, plasma viral load initially rises to high peak levels and then declines by as much as 2 to 3log 10copies to reach a stable lower level (the virologic set point) approximately 6 to 12 months after acute infection.9,10In infected adults, the stable lower level (or viral set point) correlates with the subsequent risk of disease progression or death in the absence of therapy.11 The pattern of change in plasma viral load in untreated perinatally infected infants differs from that ininfected adults and adolescents. High plasma viral load persists in untreated infected children for prolongedperiods. 12,13In one prospective study of infants with perinatal infection born prior to antiretroviral (ARV) availability in children, plasma viral loads generally were low at birth (i.e., <10,000 copies/mL), increased tohigh values by age 2 months (most infants had values >100,000 copies/mL, ranging from undetectable tonearly 10 million copies/mL), and then decreased slowly, with a mean plasma viral load during the first yearof life of 185,000 copies/mL. 14After the first year of life, plasma viral load slowly declined over the next fewGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-3years.14-17Viral load during the first 12 to 24 months after birth showed an average decline of approximately 0.6 log10copies/mL per year, followed by an average decline of 0.3 log10copies/mL per year until age 4 to 5 years. This pattern probably reflects the lower efficiency of an immature but developing immune system in containing viral replication and possibly the rapid expansion of HIV-susceptible cells that occurs withsomatic growth. 18 High plasma viral load in infants younger than 12 months has been correlated with disease progression anddeath, but the range of plasma viral loads overlaps considerably in young infants who have rapid diseaseprogression and those who do not. 12,14Plasma viral load >100,000 copies/mL in older children also has been associated with high risk of disease progression and mortality, particularly if CD4 percentage is <15% (seeTable C in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ).16,17The most robust data set available to elucidate the predictive value of plasma viral load for disease progression in children was assembled in the HPPMCS4(see Immunologic Monitoring in Children: General Considerations ) in children on no therapy or only zidovudine monotherapy, which showed that the risk of clinical progression to AIDS or death dramatically increaseswhen viral load exceeds 100,000 copies (5.0 log 10copies)/mL; at lower values, only younger children show much variation in risk (see Figures D and E and Table A in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ). At any given viral load, infants younger than 1 year were at higher risk of progression than older children, althoughthese differences were less striking than those observed for the CD4 percentage data. Despite data indicating that high plasma viral load is associated with disease progression, the predictive value of specific HIV RNA concentrations for disease progression and death for an individual child ismoderate. 16Plasma viral load may be difficult to interpret during the first year of life because values are high and are less predictive of disease progression risk than in older children.13In both HIV-infected children and adults, CD4 cell count or percentage and plasma viral load are independent predictors of disease progressionand mortality risk, and use of the two markers together more accurately defines prognosis. 16,17,19,20 Methodological Considerations in Interpretation and Comparability of HIV RNA Assays Several different methods can be used for quantitating HIV RNA, each of which has a different level ofsensitivity (see Table). Although the results of the assays are correlated, the absolute HIV RNA copy numberobtained from a single specimen tested by two different assays can differ by twofold (0.3 log 10copies/mL) or more.21,22If possible, because of the variability among assays in techniques and quantitative HIV RNA measurements, a single HIV RNA assay method should be used consistently to monitor an individualpatient. 23-25 The predominant HIV-1 subtype in the United States is subtype B\u2014the subtype for which all initial assayswere targeted. Current kit configurations for all companies have been designed to detect and quantitateessentially all viral subtypes, with the exception of the uncommon O subtypes. 26,27This is important for many regions of the world where non-B subtypes are predominant as well as for the United States, where asmall subset of individuals are infected with non-B viral subtypes. 23,28-32It is particularly relevant for children who are born outside the United States or to foreign-born parents. Choice of HIV RNA assay, particularly foryoung children, may be influenced by the amount of blood required for the assay. The NucliSENS assayrequires the least blood (100 \u00b5L of plasma), followed by the RT-PCR assays such as the COBASMapliPrep/TaqMan (1 microliter of plasma) and VERSANT assays (500 microliters of plasma). Biologic variation in plasma viral load within one person is well documented. In adults, repeated measurement of plasma viral load using the same assay can vary by as much as threefold (0.5 log 10 copies/mL) in either direction over the course of a day or on different days.19,22This biologic variation may be greater in infected infants and young children. This inherent biologic variability must be considered wheninterpreting changes in plasma viral load in children. Thus, on repeated testing, only differences greater thanfivefold (0.7 log 10copies/mL) in infants younger than 2 years and greater than threefold (0.5 log10 copies/mL) in children aged 2 years and older should be considered reflective of plasma viral load changesthat are biologically and clinically substantial.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-4Generally, no change in ARV treatment should be made as a result of a change in plasma viral load unless the change is confirmed by a second measurement. Interpretation of plasma viral load for clinical decisionmaking should be done by or in consultation with an expert in pediatric HIV infection because of thecomplexities of HIV RNA testing and the age-related changes in plasma viral load in children. Based on accumulated experience with currently available assays, viral suppression is currently defined as a plasma viral load below the detection limit of the assay used (generally <20 to 75 copies/mL). This definitionof suppression has been much more thoroughly investigated in HIV-infected adults than in HIV-infectedchildren (see the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ).33Temporary viral load elevations (\"blips\") between the level of detection and 500 copies/mL often are detected in adults34and children on cART and should not be considered to represent virologic failure as long as the values return to below the level ofdetection at the time of repeat testing. For definitions and management of virologic treatment failure, seeRecognizing and Managing Antiretroviral Treatment Failure in Management of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy . These definitions of viral suppression and virologic failure are recommended for clinical use. Research protocols or surveillance programs may use different definitions. Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Children with HIV Infection Table 3 provides one proposed general monitoring schedule, which should be adjusted based on the specific cART regimen a child is receiving. Entry into Care\u2014Baseline Evaluation At entry into care, HIV-infected children should have a complete age-appropriate medical history, physicalexamination, and laboratory evaluation (see Table 3 ). This should include a general medical and social history (e.g., immunizations, nutrition, physical and social environment), evaluation for HIV-specificphysical conditions (e.g., growth delay, microcephaly, motor or cognitive neurologic problems), evaluationfor HIV-associated laboratory anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated glucose,transaminases or creatinine, hypoalbuminemia), and assessment of presence or risk of opportunisticinfections (see the Pediatric Opportunistic Infections Guidelines ). Laboratory confirmation of HIV infection should be obtained if available documentation is incomplete (seeDiagnosis of HIV Infection ). CD4 cell count and percentage, as well as plasma HIV RNA measurements (i.e., viral load), should be obtained at entry into care to help guide decisions about timing of cART initiation(see When to Initiate ). Genotype resistance testing should be performed, even if cART is not initiated immediately. For patients previously treated with ARV drugs, resistance evaluation requires a complete ARVhistory (see Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing ). Monitoring of Children Not Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy Children not receiving cART should be evaluated every 3 to 4 months with measurement of CD4 cell countand percentage and plasma viral load; evaluation of growth and development for signs of HIV-associatedchange; and laboratory evaluation for HIV-associated conditions including anemia, leukopenia,thrombocytopenia, elevated glucose, transaminases, or creatinine, and hypoalbuminemia. Urinalysis shouldbe obtained every 6 to 12 months to monitor for HIV-associated nephropathy. Opportunistic infectionmonitoring should follow guidelines appropriate for the child's exposure history and clinical setting (see thePediatric Opportunistic Infections Guidelines ). More frequent evaluation may be necessary for children experiencing virologic, immunologic, or clinicaldeterioration or to confirm an abnormal value. Initiation of Combination Antiretroviral Therapy\u2014Overview Readiness for ARV adherence should be assessed prior to starting cART. If abacavir is being considered aspart of the regimen, HLA-B*5701 testing should be sent prior to initiation of that ARV , and an alternativeGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-5ARV should be used if HLA-B*5701 is positive (see Abacavir in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). Genotype resistance testing is recommended if not already performed (see Antiretroviral Drug- Resistance Testing ). Children who start cART or who change to a new regimen should be followed to assess effectiveness, tolerability, and adverse effects of the regimen and to evaluate medication adherence. Frequent patient visits andintensive follow-up during the initial months after a new ARV regimen is started are necessary to support andeducate the family. The first few weeks of cART can be particularly difficult for children and their caregivers;they must adjust their schedules to allow for consistent and routine administration of medication doses. Childrenmay also experience adverse effects of medications, and both children and their caregivers need assistance todetermine whether the effects are temporary and tolerable or are more serious or long-term and require a visit tothe clinician. It is critical that providers speak to caregivers and children in a supportive, non-judgmental mannerusing layman's terms. This promotes honest reporting and ensures dialogue between providers and both childrenand their caregiver(s), even when medication adherence is reported to be inconsistent. Monitoring of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy Evaluations at Initiation of Combination Antiretroviral Therapy At the time of cART initiation, CD4 cell count and percentage and plasma viral load should be measured to establish a baseline to monitor cART benefit. To set the baseline for monitoring cART toxicity (seeManagement of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance ), complete blood count (CBC) and anemia,leukopenia, and macrocytosis (see Drug Information ). Electrolytes help identify decrease, andproteinuria can occur (see Tenofovir in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). Use of protease transaminases aspartate aminotransferase) increase Bilirubin should be measured prior tostarting atazanavir because that drug causes an increase in indirect bilirubin (see Atazanavir in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). For further details of adverse effects associated with a particular ARV , see Tables 11a-11l in Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance . Within 1 to 2 Weeks of Initiation of Combination Antiretroviral Therapy Within 1 to 2 weeks of initiating therapy, children should be evaluated either in person or by phone to identify clinical adverse effects and to support adherence. Many clinicians plan additional contacts (inperson, by telephone, or via email) with children and caregivers to support adherence during the first fewweeks of therapy. 2 to 4 Weeks after Initiation of Combination Antiretroviral Therapy While data are limited on which to base an exact recommendation about precise timing, most experts recommend laboratory testing at 2 to 4 weeks (and not more than 8 weeks) after initiation of cART to assessvirologic response and laboratory toxicity. The selection of laboratory chemistry tests is regimen-specific(see above). Evaluation of hepatic transaminases is recommended at 2 weeks and 4 weeks for patientsstarting treatment that includes nevirapine (see Nevirapine in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). Plasma viral load monitoring is important as a marker of response to cART because a fall in viral load suggests medication adherence, administration of appropriate doses, and viral drug susceptibility.Some experts favor measuring viral load at 2 weeks to ensure that viral load is declining. Because of higherbaseline viral load in infants and young children, the decline in viral load after cART initiation may beslower than in adults. A significant decrease in viral load in response to cART should be observed by 4 to 8weeks of therapy.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection D-6Routine Testing for Patients Receiving Combination Antiretroviral Therapy After the initial phase of cART initiation, regimen adherence, effectiveness (CD4 cell count and percentage and plasma viral load), and toxicities (history, physical, and laboratory testing as above) should be assessedevery 3 to 4 months in children receiving cART. Children who develop symptoms of toxicity should haveappropriate laboratory evaluations (such as evaluation of serum lactate in a child receiving NRTIs whodevelops symptoms suspicious for lactic acidosis). If laboratory evidence of toxicity is identified, testingshould be performed more frequently until the toxicity resolves. Testing for Patients Who are Stable on Long-Term Combination Antiretroviral Therapy Recent studies have critically evaluated the frequency of laboratory monitoring in both adults and children, particularly CD4 cell count and plasma viral load. These studies support less frequent monitoring in stablepatients in whom viral suppression has been sustained for at least a year. 35-40The current Adult and Adolescent Guidelines support plasma viral load testing every 6 months for individuals who have 1. CD4 count >350 cells/mm3 2. Consistent virus suppression for more than 2 years. The Panel finds value in continuing viral load testing every 3 to 4 months to provide enhanced monitoring of adherence or disease progression among children and youth. Some experts monitor CD4 cell count andpercentage less frequently (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) in children and youth who are adherent to therapy andhave CD4 cell value well above the threshold for opportunistic infection risk, sustained viral suppression,and stable clinical status for more than 2 to 3 years. Some clinicians find value in visits every 3 months evenwhen lab testing is not performed in order to review adherence and update dosing for interim growth. Testing at the Time of Switching Combination Antiretroviral Therapy When a switch in regimen is made to simplify cART, labs appropriate to the toxicity profile of the new regimen should be measured at baseline, with follow up including plasma viral load at 4 weeks (and notmore than 8 weeks) after the switch, to ensure efficacy of the new regimen. If the regimen is switchedbecause of cART failure (see Recognizing and Managing Antiretroviral Treatment Failure in Management of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy ) resistance testing should be performed while a patient is still receiving the failing regimen to optimize the chance of identifying resistance mutations because resistantstrains may revert to wild type within a few weeks of stopping ARV drugs (see Antiretroviral Drug- Resistance Testing ).

If abacavir is being considered as part of the regimen, send HLA- B*5701 testing prior to initiation of that ARV and choose an alternative ARV if HLA-B*5701 is positive (see Abacavir in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). Genotype resistance testing is recommended if not already performed (see Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing ). Send tests appropriate to the toxicities expected from each patient's cART regimen and history (see text). 3If cART is initiated within 30 to 45 days of a pre-therapy lab result, repeat testing may not be necessary. 4CD4 cell count and percentage can be monitored less frequently (every 6-12 months) in children and youth who are adherent to therapy and have CD4 cell value well above the threshold for opportunistic infection risk, sustained viral suppression, and stableclinical status for more than 2 to 3 years. 5If lipids have been abnormal in the past, more frequent monitoring might be needed. For patients treated with tenofovir, more frequent urinalysis is considered. 6When considering starting antiretrovirals with activity against hepatitis B, specifically lamivudine, emtricitabine-, and tenofovir- containing regimens Key to Acronyms: ARV = antiretroviral, cART = combination antiretroviral therapy, CBC = complete blood count, CD4 = CD4 T lymphocyte Table 4.

Combination antiretroviral therapy(cART) regimens including at least three drugs from at least two drug classes are recommended; suchregimens have been associated with enhanced survival, reduction in opportunistic infections and othercomplications of HIV infection, improved growth and neurocognitive function, and improved quality of lifein children. 1-5In the United States and the United Kingdom, significant declines in morbidity, mortality, and hospitalizations have been reported in HIV-infected children between 1994 and 2006, concomitant withincreased use of highly active combination regimens. 6-8As a result, perinatally HIV-infected children are now living into the third and fourth decades of life, and potentially beyond. The increased survival of HIV-infected children is associated with challenges in selecting successive new ARV drug regimens. In addition, therapy is associated with short- and long-term toxicities, which can berecognized in childhood or adolescence 9-12(see Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance ). ARV drug-resistant virus can develop during cART because of poor adherence, subtherapeutic drug levels, aregimen that is not potent, or a combination of these factors which results in incomplete viral suppression. Inaddition, primary drug resistance may be seen in ARV-naive children who have become infected with aresistant virus. 13-15Thus, decisions about when to start therapy (see When to Initiate ), what drugs to choose in ARV-naive children (see What to Start ) and how to best treat ARV-experienced children remain complex. Whenever possible, decisions regarding the management of pediatric HIV infection should be directed by ormade in consultation with a specialist in pediatric and adolescent HIV infection. Treatment of ARV-naivechildren (when and what to start), when to change therapy, and treatment of ARV-experienced children willbe discussed in separate sections of the guidelines. Several factors need to be considered in making decisions about initiating and changing cART in children, including: Severity of HIV disease and risk of disease progression, as determined by age, presence or history of HIV-related illnesses, degree of CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) immunosuppression, (see Revised Surveillance Case Definition for HIV Infection at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6303.pdf ) and level of HIV plasma viremia; Availability of appropriate (and palatable) drug formulations and pharmacokinetic (PK) information on appropriate dosing in a child's age/weight group; Potency, complexity (e.g., dosing frequency, food and fluid requirements), and potential short- and long- term adverse effects of the cART regimen; Effect of initial regimen choice on later therapeutic options; A child's cART history; Presence of ARV drug-resistant virus; Presence of comorbidity, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C virus infection, or chronic renal or liver disease, that could affect decisions about drug choice and the timing of initiation of therapy; Potential ARV drug interactions with other prescribed, over-the-counter, or complementary/alternative medications taken by a child; and The anticipated ability of the caregiver and child to adhere to the regimen.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection E-2The following recommendations provide general guidance for decisions related to treatment of HIV-infected children, and flexibility should be exercised according to a child's individual circumstances. Guidelines fortreatment of HIV-infected children are evolving as new data from clinical trials become available. Althoughprospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials offer the best evidence for formulation of guidelines, mostARV drugs are approved for use in pediatric patients based on efficacy data from clinical trials in adults, withsupporting PK and safety data from Phase I/II trials in children. In addition, efficacy has been defined inmost adult trials based on surrogate marker data, as opposed to clinical endpoints. For the development ofthese guidelines, the Panel reviewed relevant clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals or in abstractform, with attention to data from pediatric populations when available. Goals of Antiretroviral Treatment Although there was a single case report of a period of prolonged remission in an HIV-infected child treatedwith a cART regimen initiated at age 30 hours, 16viremia returned in this child after more than 2 years of undetectable HIV RNA levels following discontinuation of cART. Current cART has not been shown toeradicate HIV infection in perinatally infected infants due to persistence of HIV in CD4 lymphocytes andother cells. 17-19Some data suggest that the half-life of intracellular HIV proviral DNA is even longer in infected children than in adults (median 14 months vs. 5-10 months, respectively).20Thus, based on currently available data, HIV causes a chronic infection likely requiring treatment for life once a child startstherapy. The goals of cART for HIV-infected children and adolescents include: Preventing and reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality; Restoring and/or preserving immune function as reflected by CD4 cell measures; Maximally and durably suppressing viral of viral drug-resistance mutations; Minimizing drug-related toxicity; Maintaining normal physical growth and neurocognitive development; Improving quality of life; Reducing the risk of sexual transmission to discordant partners in adolescents who are sexually active; and Reducing the risk of perinatal transmission in adolescent females who become pregnant. Strategies to achieve these goals require a complex balance of potentially competing considerations. Use and Selection of Combination Antiretroviral Therapy The treatment of choice for HIV-infected children is a regimen containing at least three drugs from at least two classes of ARV drugs. The Panel has recommended several preferred and alternative regimens (see What to Start ). The most appropriate regimen for an individual child depends on multiple factors as noted above. A regimen that is characterized as an alternative choice may be a preferred regimen for some patients. Drug Sequencing and Preservation of Future Treatment Option The choice of ARV treatment regimens should include consideration of future treatment options, such as thepresence of or potential for drug resistance. Multiple changes in ARV drug regimens can rapidly exhausttreatment options and should be avoided. Appropriate sequencing of drugs for use in initial and second-linetherapy can preserve future treatment options and is another strategy to maximize long-term benefit fromtherapy. Current recommendations for initial therapy are to use two classes of drugs (see What to Start ), thereby sparing three classes of drugs for later use. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection E-3Maximizing Adherence As discussed in Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Children and Adolescents , poor adherence to prescribed regimens can lead to subtherapeutic levels of ARV medications, which increases the risk of development of drug resistance and likelihood of virologic failure. Issues related to adherence totherapy should be fully assessed, discussed, and addressed with a child's caregiver and the child (when ageappropriate) before the decision to initiate therapy is made. Participation by the caregiver and child in thedecision-making process is crucial. Potential problems should be identified and resolved before startingtherapy, even if this delays initiation of therapy. In addition, frequent follow-up is important to assessvirologic response to therapy, drug intolerance, viral resistance, and adherence. Finally, in patients whoexperience virologic failure, it is critical to fully assess adherence and possible viral resistance before makingchanges to the cART regimen. References 1.

Aggressive therapy inthe early stages of HIV infection has the potential to control viral replication before HIV can evolve intodiverse and potentially more pathogenic quasispecies. Initiation of therapy at higher CD4 T lymphocyte(CD4) cell counts has been associated with fewer drug resistance mutations at virologic failure in adults. 1 Early therapy also slows immune system destruction and preserves immune function, preventing clinicaldisease progression. 2,3Ongoing viral replication may be associated with persistent inflammation and development of cardiovascular, kidney, and liver disease and malignancy; studies in adults suggest that earlycontrol of replication may reduce the occurrence of these non-AIDS complications. 2,4-6Conversely, delaying therapy until later in the course of HIV infection, when clinical or immunologic symptoms appear, may resultin reduced evolution of drug-resistant virus due to a lack of drug selection pressure, improved adherence tothe therapeutic regimen due to perceived need when the patient becomes symptomatic, and reduced ordelayed adverse effects of cART. Because therapy in children is initiated at a young age and will likely belife-long, concerns about adherence and toxicities are particularly important. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines Panel(the Panel) has recommended initiation of therapy for all adults with HIV infection, with the proviso that thestrength of the recommendations is dependent on the pre-treatment CD4 count. 7Randomized clinical trials have provided definitive evidence of benefit with initiation of therapy in adults with CD4 counts 200 to <350 cells/mm 3.8A secondary analysis of an international randomized trial in adults with CD4 counts between 350 and 550 cells/mm3versus waiting until the CD4 count dropped below 250 cells/mm3showed significantly fewer AIDS events and tuberculosis diagnoses when treatment was initiated at a higher CD4 count (median 442 vs.230 cells/mm 3).9Observational cohort data have also demonstrated the benefit of treatment in adults with CD4 counts between 350 and 500 cells/mm3in reducing morbidity and mortality; therefore, adult treatment guidelines recommend initiation of lifelong cART for individuals with CD4 counts 350 to 500 cells/mm3.7,10-13 For adults with CD4 counts >500 cell/mm3, observational data are less conclusive regarding the potential survival benefit of early treatment.10,11,14The recommendation for initiation of therapy at CD4 counts >500/mm3 in adults is based on accumulating data that untreated HIV infection may be associated with development ofmany non-AIDS-defining diseases, the availability of more effective cART regimens with improved tolerability,and evidence that effective cART reduces secondary sexual HIV transmission. 15However, the Panel acknowledges that the amount of data supporting earlier initiation of therapy decreases as the CD4 countincreases above 500 cells/mm 3, and that concerns remain over the unknown overall benefit, long-term risks, cumulative additional costs, and potential for decreased medication adherence associated with earlier treatmentin asymptomatic patients. 7Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-2Treatment Recommendations for Initiation of Therapy in Antiretroviral-Naive, HIV-Infected Infants and Children Infants Younger Than Age 12 Months The Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy (CHER) Trial, a randomized clinical trial in South Africa, demonstrated that initiating triple-drug cART before 12 weeks in asymptomatic perinatally infected infants with normal CD4 percentage (>25%) resulted in a 75% reduction in early mortality , compared with delayingNote: Adherence should be assessed and discussed with HIV-infected children and their caregivers before initiation of therapy (AIII). aWithin 1-2 weeks, including an expedited discussion on adherence bMore time can be taken to fully assess and address issues associated with adherence with the caregivers and the child prior to initiating therapy. Patients/caregivers may choose to postpone therapy, and on a case-by-case basis, providers may elect to defer therapy based on clinical and/or psychosocial factors. cCD4 counts should be confirmed with a second test to meet the treatment criteria before initiation of cART. dTo avoid overinterpretation of temporary blips in viral load (which can occur, for example, during intercurrent illnesses), plasma HIV RNA level >100,000 copies/mL should be confirmed by a second level before initiating cART.

A substudy of this trial also found that infants treated early had significantly better gross motor and neurodevelopmental profiles than those in whom therapy was deferred.17Because the risk of rapid progression is so high in young infants and based on the data in young infants from the CHER study, the Panel recommends initiating therapy for all infants <12 months regardless of clinical status, CD4 percentage, or viral load ( T able 5 ). Before therapy is initiated, it is important to fully assess, discuss, and address issues associated with adherence with an HIV-infected infant's caregivers. However, given the high risk of disease progression and mortality in young HIV-infected infants, it is importantto expedite this assessment in infants younger than 12 months. The risk of disease progression is inversely correlated with the age of a child, with the youngest infants at greatest risk of rapid disease progression. Progression to moderate or severe immune suppression is also frequent in older infected infants; by 12 months, approximately 50% of children develop moderate immune suppression and 20% develop severe immune suppression.18In the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study meta- analysis, the 1-year risk of AIDS or death was substantially higher in younger children than in older children at any given level of CD4 percentage, particularly for infants younger than <12 months.19Unfortunately, although the risk of progression is greatest in the first year of life, the ability to differentiate children at risk of rapid versus slower disease progression by clinical and laboratory parameters is also most limited in young infants. No specific\"at-risk\" viral or immunologic threshold can be easily identified, and progression of HIV disease and opportunistic infections can occur in young infants with normal CD4 cell counts.19 Identification of HIV infection during the first few months of life permits clinicians to initiate cART during theinitial phases of primary infection. Data from a number of observational studies in the United States andEurope suggest that infants who receive early treatment are less likely to progress to AIDS or death than thosewho start therapy later. 2,20,21A study of 195 South African children initiating cART aged <24 months found that infants treated by 6 months achieved target growth milestones more rapidly than children who initiated therapybetween 12 and 24 months. 22Several small studies have demonstrated that, despite the very high levels of viral replication in perinatally infected infants, early initiation of treatment can result in durable viral suppressionand normalization of immunologic responses to non-HIV antigens in some infants. 23,24In infants with sustained control of plasma viremia, failure to detect extra-chromosomal replication intermediates suggests near-complete control of viral replication. 25Some of these infants have become HIV seronegative. Although there is a single case report of a period of remission in an HIV-infected child treated with a cART regimen initiated atage 30 hours, discussed below, current cART has not been shown to eradicate HIV infection in perinatallyinfected infants because of persistence of HIV in CD4 lymphocytes and other cells. 26-28 The report of a prolonged remission in an HIV-infected child in Mississippi generated discussion about early initiation of cART in newborn infants with high-risk HIV exposure. This newborn, born to a mother who did notreceive antenatal or perinatal cAR T, was treated with a three-drug cART regimen at ages 30 hours through 18 months, after which cART was discontinued against medical advice. Intensive follow-up evaluations showed noevidence of virologic rebound for more than 2 years following discontinuation of cAR T, at which time viremia recurred and cART was restarted.29This experience has prompted increasing support for initiation of treatment in the first weeks of life, as soon as the diagnosis is made. However, because of limited safety andpharmacokinetic data and experience with antiretroviral (AR V) drugs in infants <2 to 4 weeks, drug and dose selection in this age group is challenging (see What to Start and Specific Issues in Antiretroviral Treatment for Neonates ). If early treatment is initiated, the Panel does not recommend empiric treatment interruption. Virologic suppression may take longer to achieve in young children than in older children or adults.30,31 Possible reasons for the slower response in infants include higher virologic set points in young infants,inadequate ARV drug levels, and poor adherence because of the difficulties in administering complex regimensto infants. With currently available drug regimens, rates of viral suppression of 70% to 80% have been reportedin HIV-infected infants initiating therapy at <12 months. 2,32,33In a 5-year follow-up study of 40 HIV-infected children who initiated treatment at <6 months, 98% had CD4 percentage >25% median follow-up of 5.96 years. 2More rapid viral suppression in young infants may also beGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-4important in reducing the long-lived HIV reservoir; a study of 17 HIV-infected infants initiating lopinavir/ritonavir-based cART before 6 months demonstrated that time to the first HIV viral load <400 copies/mL was correlated with the size of the long-lived HIV reservoir (i.e,. the resting memory CD4 cell pool).34In addition, in the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study/Adolescent Master Protocol (a cross-sectional study of 144 perinatally infected youth with long term viral suppression) found a lower proviral reservoir inthose who achieved virologic control at <1 year versus 1 to 5 years versus >5 years of age (4.2 vs. 19.4 vs. 70.7 copies/million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respectively). 35 Information on appropriate drug dosing in infants younger than 3 to 6 months is limited. Hepatic and renal functions are immature in newborns undergoing rapid maturational changes during the first few months of life, which can result in substantial dif ferences in ARV dose requirements between young infants and older children.36When drug concentrations are subtherapeutic, either because of inadequate dosing, poor absorption, or incomplete adherence, ARV drug resistance can develop rapidly, particularly in the setting of high levels ofviral replication in young infants. Frequent follow-up and continued assessment and support of adherence areespecially important when treating young infants (see Adherence ). Finally, the possibility of long-term toxicities (e.g., lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, osteopenia,mitochondrial dysfunction) with prolonged therapy is a concern. 37 Children Aged 1 Year and Older In general, disease progression is less rapid in children aged 1 year,18However, children with stage 3-defining opportunistic infections (see Revised Surveillance Case Definition for HIV Infection athttp://www .cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6303.pdf and Table 7 ) are at high risk of disease progression and death. Given the high risk of disease progression and mortality with severe HIV disease, the Panel recommends urgent treatment(i.e., within 1-2 weeks) for all such children, regardless of immunologic or virologic status. In these cases, the clinical team should expedite a discussion on adherence and provide increased, intensive follow-up in the first few weeks to support the children and families. Children aged 1 year who have mild to moderate clinical symptoms (see Table 7 ) or who are asymptomatic are at lower risk of disease progression than children with more severe clinical symptoms.38In these children, more time can be taken to fully assess, discuss and address issues associated with adherence with the caregivers and the children prior to initiating therapy. In asymptomatic children, consideration of CD4 count and viral load may be useful in determining the need for therapy. In adults, the strength of recommendations to initiate cART in asymptomatic individuals is based primarily onrisk of disease progression, as determined by baseline CD4 cell count. 7In adults, both clinical trial and observational data support initiation of treatment in individuals with CD4 counts <350 cells/mm3. In HIV- infected adults in Haiti, a randomized clinical trial found significant reductions in mortality and morbidity withinitiation of treatment when CD4 counts fell to <350 cells/mm 3, compared with deferring treatment until CD4 cell counts fell to <200 cells/mm3.8In observational data in adults, a collaborative analysis of data from 12 adult cohorts in North America and Europe on 20,379 adults starting treatment between 1995 and 2003, the risk ofAIDS or death was significantly less in adults who started treatment with CD4 counts 200 to 350 cells/mm 3 compared with those who started therapy at CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3.39A prospective observational cohort study of 468 adults found that initiation of cART within 4 months of infection resulted in the highest likelihoodand fastest rate of recovery of CD4 counts when compared with initiation between 4 and 12 months or morethan 12 months post-infection. Furthermore, starting cART at lower CD4 counts, defined as <500 cells/mm 3, as compared with higher CD4 counts, was associated with a significant reduction in CD4 recovery.40 The Cochrane Collaboration41published a review on the effectiveness of cART in HIV-infected children aged <2 years based on data from published randomized trials of early versus deferred cART.16,42The authors concluded that immediate therapy reduces morbidity and mortality and may improve neurologic outcome, but that data areless compelling in support of universal initiation of treatment between ages 1 and 2 years. The Pediatric Randomised Early versus Deferred Initiation in Cambodia and Thailand (PREDICT) trial wasGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-5designed to investigate the impact on AIDS-free survival and neurodevelopment of deferral of cART in >1 open-label trial randomized 300 HIV-infected children aged >1 year (median 6.4 years) to immediate initiation of cART or deferral until the CD4 percentage was <15%. The median was 19% (IQR 16% to 22%) and 46% of children in the deferred group started cART during the study.AIDS-free survival at week 144 was 98.7% (95% CI 94.7-99.7) in the deferred group and 97.9% (CI 93.7-99.3)in the immediate therapy group ( P= 0.6), and immediate cART did not significantly improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. 44However, because of the low event rate, the study was underpowered to detect a difference between the two groups. This study population likely had a selection bias toward relatively slowlyprogressive disease because it enrolled children who had survived a median of 6 years without cART. The limitedenrollment of children aged <3 years poses restrictions on its value for recommendations in that age group. A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial addresses the comparative efficacy of starting versus deferring treatment at higher CD4 thresholds in HIV-infected adults. The HPTN 052 trial randomized 1763HIV -serodiscordant couples to initiate ARV treatment either on entry into the study (median CD4 counts of 442 IQR 373-522 cells/mm3) or after a decline in CD4 count to <250 cells/mm3or with onset of an (median CD4 count 230 [IQR 197-249] cells/mm3). New-onset AIDS events and tuberculosis occurred more frequently in the delayed versus early treatment group ( P= 0.031 and 0.018, respectively), thus showing a benefit to starting cAR T early, when the CD4 count is over 400 cells/mm3.9Two observational studies in adults\u2014the ART Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) and North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration onResearch and Design (NA-ACCORD)\u2014also suggest a higher rate of progression to AIDS or death in patientsdeferring treatment until the CD4 count is <350/mm 3compared with patients starting cART at CD4 counts of 351 to 500 cells/mm3.10,11The NA-ACCORD study demonstrated a benefit of starting treatment at CD4 cell counts >500 cell/mm3compared with starting cART at CD4 cell counts below this threshold;10however, the ART-CC cohort found no additional benefit for patients starting cART with CD4 cell counts >450 cells/mm3.11 In a third observational study of 5,162 patients with CD4 cell counts between 500 and 799 cells/mm3, patients who started cART immediately did not experience a significant reduction in progression to AIDS or death (HR:1.10, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.79) or death alone (HR: 95% CI: 0.49 to 2.12), compared with those whodeferred therapy. 13There are no similar observational data analyses for HIV-infected children. In children, the prognostic significance of a specific CD4 percentage or count varies with age.19,45In data from the HIV Paediatric Prognostic child-years of follow-up, the risk of mortality or progression to AIDS per 100 child-years issignificantly higher for any given CD4 count in children ages 1 to 4 years than in children aged 5 years (seeFigures A and B and Tables A and B in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ). Data from the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study suggest that absolute CD4 cell count is a usefulprognostic marker for disease progression in children aged 5 years, with risk of progression similar to thatobserved in adults (see Table B in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ).19,46For children ages 1 to <5 years, a similar increase in risk of AIDS or death is seen when CD4 percentage drops below 25% (see TableA in Appendix C: Supplemental Information ). Because the CD4 percentage is more consistent than the naturally declining CD4 cell count in the first yearsof life, it has been used preferentially to monitor immunologic status in children aged <5 years. However, ananalysis of more than 21,000 pairs of CD4 measurements from 3,345 children aged <1 to 16 years in the HIVPaediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study found that CD4 cell counts and percentages werefrequently discordant around established World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pediatric EuropeanNetwork for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) thresholds for initiation of cART (14% and 21%, respectively). 47 Furthermore, CD4 cell counts were found to provide greater prognostic value over CD4 percentage for short-term disease progression for children aged <5 years as well as in older children. For example, the estimatedhazard ratio for AIDS or death at the 10th centile of CD4 cell count (compared with the 50th centile) was 2.2(95% confidence interval [CI]) 1.4, 3.0) for children ages 1 to 2 years versus 1.2 (CI 0.8, 1.6) for CD4percentage. Recently, the CDC has issued an updated HIV infection staging classification based on age-specific CD4 values, indicating a preference for CD4 count over CD4 percentage in all ages (see RevisedGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-6Surveillance Case Definition for HIV Infection at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6303.pdf ). The level of plasma HIV RNA may provide useful information in terms of risk of progression, although its prognostic significance is weaker than CD4 count.45Several studies have shown that older children with HIV RNA levels 100,000 copies/mL are at high risk of mortality48-50and lower neurocognitive performance;51 similar findings have been reported in adults.52-54Similarly, in the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study meta-analysis, the 1-year risk of progression to AIDS or death rose sharply for childrenaged >1 year when HIV RNA levels were 100,000 copies/mL (see Figures D and E and Table A inAppendix C: Supplemental Information ).45For example, the estimated 1-year risk of death was 2 to 3 times higher in children with plasma HIV RNA 100,000 copies/mL compared with 10,000 copies/mL and 8 to 10times higher with plasma HIV RNA >1,000,000 copies/mL. Therefore, the Panel recommends that childrenof all ages with HIV RNA levels >100,000 copies/mL initiate cART. As with data in adults, data from pediatric studies suggest that improvement in immunologic parameters is better in children when treatment is initiated at higher CD4 percentage/count levels.31,55-60In a study of 1,236 perinatally infected children in the United States, only 36% of those who started treatment with CD4percentage <15% and 59% of those starting with CD4 percentage 15% to 24% achieved CD4 percentage >25% after 5 years of therapy. 61Younger age at initiation of therapy has also been associated with improved immune response and with more rapid growth reconstitution.22,31,55,61,62In addition, the PREDICT Study demonstrated improved height z-scores in the early treatment arm compared with no improvement in the deferred arm.43 Given that disease progression in children aged 5 years is similar to that in adults,46and observational data in adults show decreased risk of mortality with initiation of therapy when CD4 cell count is <500 cells/mm3,10,11 most experts feel that recommendations for asymptomatic children in this age range should be similar to thosefor adults. However, there are no conclusive pediatric data to address the optimal CD4 cell count threshold forinitiation of therapy in older children; additional research studies are needed to answer this question in childrenmore definitively. The Panel has moved to endorse initiating cART in all HIV-infected adults regardless of CD4cell count, using varying strengths of evidence to support different CD4 cell count thresholds 7and incorporating compelling data demonstrating that cART is effective in preventing secondary transmission ofHIV . However, prevention of sexual transmission of HIV is not a significant consideration for children aged<13 years. Comparative studies on the impact of treatment versus treatment delay at specific higher CD4 cellcounts have not been performed in children, and observational adult studies have produced conflictingresults. 10,11,14Drug choices are more limited in children than in adults and adequate data to address the potential long-term toxicities of prolonged cART in a developing child are not yet available. Some studies have shownthat a small proportion of perinatally infected children may be long-term nonprogressors, with no immunologicor clinical progression by age 10 years despite receiving no cART. 63-65Medication adherence is the core requirement for successful virologic control, but achieving consistent adherence in childhood is oftenchallenging. 66Incomplete adherence leads to the selection of viral resistance mutations but forced administration of ARVs to children may result in treatment aversion or fatigue, which occurs among manyperinatally infected children during adolescence. 67The relative benefits of initiating cART in asymptomatic children with low viral burdens and high CD4 cell counts must be weighed against these potential risks. The Panel recommends that cART be urgently initiated in all children younger than aged 12 months, and inthose aged 12 months or older who have Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Stage 3-definingopportunistic illnesses or Stage 3 CD4 counts (Tables 6 and 7 ). The Panel also recommends that children aged 12 months or older with the following findings initiate cART: Moderate HIV-related symptoms (Table 7 ), regardless of CD4 count; HIV RNA >100,000 copies/mL, regardless of CD4 count or symptoms; CDC Stage 2 CD4 counts (Table 6 ), with the strength of the recommendation differing based on age and CD4 count. The evidence for this recommendation is strongest for children with CD4 cell counts <350 cells/mm3. ForGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-7children with CD4 cell counts 350 to 500 cells/mm3, the recommendation is based on observational data in adults, hence the evidence base is not as strong; this recommendation should not prohibit research studies in children designed to answer this question more definitively. The Panel also recommends consideration of treatment for all children aged 12 months or older with no or mild symptoms and CDC Stage 1 CD4 counts (Tables 6and 7 ), although the strength of recommendation is lower because of limited data. Patients/caregivers may choose to postpone therapy , and, on a case-by-case basis, providers may elect to defer therapy based on clinical and/or psychosocial factors. Note that the Panel's recommendations which permit optional deferral of therapy for healthy children older than 1 year are different from the 2013 WHO guidelines,which recommend initiation of therapy for all children younger than 5 years, reflecting different approaches inresource-limited settings. In general, except in infants younger than age 12 months and children with advanced HIV infection, cART does not need to be started urgently (i.e., within 1-2 weeks). Before initiating therapy, it is important to take time to educate caregivers (and children, as appropriate) about regimen adherence and to anticipate and resolve any barriers that might diminish adherence. This is particularly true for children age 5 years and older, given their lower risk of disease progression and the higher CD4 cell count threshold now recommended for initiating therapy. If therapy is deferred, the health care provider should closely monitor a child's virologic, immunologic, andclinical status every 3 to 4 months (see Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring ). Factors to consider in deciding when to initiate therapy in children in whom treatment was deferred include: Increasing HIV RNA levels (e.g., HIV RNA levels approaching 100,000 copies/mL); CD4 count or percentage values approaching the age-related threshold for treatment; Development of clinical symptoms; and The ability of caregiver and child to adhere to the prescribed regimen. Table 5. Indications for Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Children (page 1 of 2) Table 5 provides general guidance rather than absolute recommendations for individual patients. Factors to be considered in decisions about initiation of therapy include risk of disease progression as determined by CD4percentage or count and plasma HIV RNA copy number, the potential benefits and risks of therapy, and theability of the caregiver to adhere to administration of the therapeutic regimen. Urgent treatment should beinitiated within 1 to 2 weeks, including an expedited discussion on adherence. In non-urgent settings, more timecan be taken to fully assess and address issues associated with adherence with the caregivers and the child priorto initiating therapy. Patients/caregivers may choose to postpone therapy and, on a case-by-case basis, providersmay elect to defer therapy based on clinical and/or psychosocial factors. a Age Criteria Recommendation <12 Months Regardless of clinical symptoms, immune status, or viral load Urgent treatment ( AIfor <12 weeks of age; AIIfor 12 weeks) 1 <6 Years CDC Stage 3-defining opportunistic illnessesbUrgent treatment (AI*) cells/ mm3Consider treatment (BIII)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection F-8Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = data from randomized controlled trials in children; I*= data from randomized trials in adults with accompanying data in children from nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II: data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long-term clinical outcomes; II* = data fromwell-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying datain chidren from smaller non-randomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcomes data; III = Expert opinion aChildren in whom cART is deferred need close follow-up.

Fewrandomized, Phase III clinical trials of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in pediatric patients existthat provide direct comparison of different treatment regimens. Most pediatric drug data come from PhaseI/II safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) trials and non-randomized, open-label studies. In general, even instudies in adults, assessment of drug efficacy and potency is primarily based on surrogate marker endpoints,such as CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and HIV RNA levels. The Panel continually modifiesPanel's Recommendations Selection of an initial regimen should be individualized based on a number of factors including characteristics of the proposed regimen, patient characteristics, and results of viral resistance testing (AIII). The Panel recommends initiating combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in treatment-naive children using one of the following preferred agents plus a dual-nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone combination: For neonates/infants aged 42 weeks postmenstrual 14 days postnatal and children <3 years: lopinavir/ritonavir (AI); For children years to <6 years: efavirenz or lopinavir/ritonavir (AI*) ; or efavirenz or lopinavir/ritonavir (AI*) . following preferred dual-nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor backbone combinations: plus emtricitabine) ; months: plus emtricitabine) or emtricitabine) (AI*) ; HLA-B*5701 genetic testing should be performed before initiating abacavir-based therapy, and abacavir should not be given to a child who tests positive for HLA-B*5701 (AII*) ; For children aged 12 years: abacavir plus lamivudine or plus emtricitabine (AI). For adolescents at Tanner Stage 4 or 5: abacavir plus lamivudine or plus emtricitabine (AI) or plus (AI*) . Table 8 provides a list of Panel-recommended alternative and acceptable regimens. For infants aged <42 weeks postmenstrual or <14 days postnatal, data are currently inadequate to provide recommended dosing to allow the formulation of an effective, complete cART regimen (see Specific Issues in Antiretroviral Therapy in Newborn Infants with HIV Infection ). Both emtricitabine and lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate have antiviral activity and efficacy against hepatitis B. For a comprehensive review of this topic, and hepatitis C and tuberculosis during HIV coinfection, the reader should access thePediatric Opportunistic Infections Guidelines . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-2recommendations on optimal initial therapy for children as new data become available, new therapies or drug formulations are developed, and additional toxicities are recognized. Information considered by the Panel for recommending specific drugs or regimens includes: Data demonstrating durable viral suppression, immunologic improvement, and clinical improvement (when such data are available) with the regimen, preferably in children as well as adults; The extent of pediatric experience with the particular drug or regimen; Incidence and types of short- and long-term drug toxicity with the regimen, with special attention to toxicity reported in children; Availability and acceptability of formulations appropriate for pediatric use, including palatability, ease of preparation (e.g., powders), volume of syrups, and pill size/number of pills; Dosing frequency and food and fluid requirements; and Potential for drug interactions with other medications. The Panel classifies recommended drugs or drug combinations into one of several categories as follows: Preferred: Drugs or drug combinations are designated as preferred for use in treatment-naive children when clinical trial data in children or, more often, in adults have demonstrated optimal and durable efficacy with acceptable toxicity and ease of use, and pediatric studies demonstrate that safety andefficacy are suggested using surrogate markers; additional considerations are listed above. Alternative: Drugs or drug combinations are designated as alternatives for initial therapy when clinical trial data in children or adults show efficacy but there are disadvantages compared with preferredregimens in terms of more limited experience in children; the extent of antiviral efficacy or durability isless well defined in children or less than a preferred regimen in adults; there are specific toxicityconcerns; or there are dosing, formulation, administration, or interaction issues for that drug or regimen. Use in Special Circumstances: Some drugs or drug combinations are recommended for use as initial therapy only in special circumstances when preferred or alternative drugs cannot be used. Factors to Consider When Selecting an Initial Regimen A cART regimen for children should generally consist of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors(NRTIs) plus one active drug from classes: non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor(NNRTI) or integrase strandtransfer inhibitors (INSTIs) or CCR5 antagonists may be considered for first-line treatment of adults, thereare insufficient data to recommend these agents as preferred agents for initial therapy in children andadolescents at this time. Choice of a regimen should be individualized based on a number of factorsincluding characteristics of the proposed regimen, patient characteristics, and results of viral resistancetesting. Advantages and disadvantages of each class-based regimen are delineated in detail in the sectionsthat follow and in Table 9 . In addition, because cART will most likely need to be administered lifelong, considerations related to the choice of initial antiretroviral (ARV) regimen should also include anunderstanding of barriers to adherence, including the complexity of schedules and food requirements fordifferent regimens, differing formulations, palatability problems, and potential limitations in subsequenttreatment options, should resistance develop. Treatment should only be initiated after assessment andcounseling of caregivers about adherence to therapy. Choice of Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor-Based versus Protease Inhibitor-Based Initial Regimens therapy include both NNRTI- and PI-based regimens. The selection of a NNRTI- or PI-based regimen should be based on patient characteristics, especially age, and preferences,results of viral drug resistance testing, and information cited below.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-3Clinical trial data in children provide some guidance for choosing between a NNRTI-based regimen and a PI- based regimen for initial therapy. The P1060 study compared a nevirapine-based regimen to a lopinavir-based regimen in HIV -infected infants and children (in 6 African countries and India) aged 2 months to 35 months. Infants and children in this study were stratified at entry based on prior maternal or infant exposure to peripartum single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis or no exposure, and and nevirapine lopinavir/ritonavir (lopinavir boosted with low-dose Median age was 0.7 years in the single-dose nevirapine-exposed and 1.7 years in the nevirapine-unexposed children. Among infants and children with prior exposure to nevirapine, 39.6% of children in the nevirapine group reached a study endpoint of death, virologic failure, or toxicity by Week 24 compared with 21.7% of children in the lopinavir/ritonavir group.1Among infants and children with no prior nevirapine exposure, 40.1% of children treated with nevirapine met a study endpoint after 24 weeks in the study compared with 18.4% of children who received lopinavir/ritonavir.2Based on these data, a PI-based regimen containing lopinavir/ritonavir is the preferred initial regimen for HIV-infected children aged <3 years. A comparison of a PI-based regimen and a NNRTI-based regimen was also undertaken in HIV-infected treatment-naive children aged 30 days to <18 years in PENPACT-1 (PENTA 9/PACTG 390) (the study did notdictate the specific NNRTI or PI drug initiated). In the PI-based group, 49% of children received lopinavir/ritonavir and 48% received nelfinavir; in the NNRTI-based children received efavirenz and 38%received nevirapine. Efavirenz was recommended only for children aged >3 years. After 4 years of follow-up,73% of children randomized to PI-based therapy and 70% randomized to NNRTI-based therapy remained ontheir initial cART regimen. In both groups, 82% of children had viral loads <400 copies/mL, suggesting thatselection of a NNRTI or a PI did not influence outcome. Although the age of participants overlapped somewhatbetween P1060 and PENPACT-1 (in PENPACT-1, the lowest quartile was aged <2.8 years), PENPACT-1generally enrolled older children. 3 Data from PROMOTE-pediatrics trial also demonstrated comparable virologic efficacy among childrenrandomized to receive either a NNRTI or lopinavir/ritonavir-based cART. 4Children were aged 2 months to <6 years, with a median of 3.1 years (intermediate between P1060 and PENPACT 1). Children had noperinatal exposure to nevirapine and could be cART-naive or currently receiving cART with HIV RNA level<400 copies/mL at enrollment. In the NNRTI arm, children aged <3 years received nevirapine and those aged>3 years primarily received efavirenz. Among 185 children randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir- (n = 91) orNNRTI- (n = 92) based cART, the proportion with HIV RNA level <400 copies/mL at 48 weeks was 80% inthe lopinavir/ritonavir arm (95% CI: -9% to +17%). With regard to virologic suppression, the results of the P1060 study suggest that a PI-based regimen containing lopinavir/ritonavir should be the preferred initial regimen for children aged <3 years. However, inboth single-dose nevirapine-exposed and nevirapine-unexposed children in the P1060 study, participantsreceiving the nevirapine-based regimen demonstrated better immunologic response and growth than thosereceiving a lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen, although these differences did not achieve statisticalsignificance. Similarly, in the NEVEREST study, children switched to a nevirapine regimen showed betterimmune and growth responses than those continuing a lopinavir/ritonavir regimen. 5Based on these findings, the potential for improved lipid profiles with nevirapine use,5,6and the poor palatability of liquid lopinavir/ritonavir, liquid nevirapine remains an acceptable alternative for infants who were not exposed toperipartum single-dose nevirapine or infant nevirapine prophylaxis and who cannot toleratelopinavir/ritonavir. In children aged 3 years, either a NNRTI-based or a PI-based regimen is acceptable. etravirine (aged 6 years) and nevirapine (aged 15 days) have an FDA-Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-4approved pediatric indication for treatment of HIV infection. In the United States, nevirapine is the only NNRTI available in a liquid formulation. Efavirenz capsules can be opened and sprinkled on age-appropriatefood. This administration procedure has been approved by the FDA for use in children as young as age 3months who weigh at least 3.5 kg. However, at this time, there are concerns regarding variable PK of thedrug in the very young and the committee does not currently endorse its use for infants and children aged 3months to 3 years at this time. Additional data about the PK in children in this age group are awaited.Advantages and disadvantages of different NNRTI drugs are delineated in Table 9 . Use of NNRTIs as initial therapy preserves the PI class for future use and confers lower risk of dyslipidemia and fat maldistributionthan use of some agents in the PI class. In addition, for children taking solid formulations, NNRTI-basedregimens generally have a lower pill burden than PI-based regimens. The major disadvantages of the currentNNRTI drugs FDA-approved for use in children are that a single viral mutation can confer high-level drugresistance to nevirapine and efavirenz, and cross resistance to other NNRTIs is common. Rare but seriousand potentially life-threatening skin and hepatic toxicity can occur with all NNRTI drugs, but is mostfrequent with nevirapine, at least in HIV-infected adults. Like PIs, NNRTIs have the potential to interact withother drugs also metabolized via hepatic enzymes; however, these drug interactions are less frequent withNNRTIs than with boosted PI regimens. Efavirenz, in combination with two NRTIs, is the preferred NNRTI for initial therapy of children aged 3 years based on clinical trial experience in adults and children. Nevirapine is considered as a component of analternative NNRTI-based regimen because of its association with the rare occurrence of significanthypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, rare but potentially life-threateninghepatitis, 7,8and conflicting data about virologic efficacy compared to preferred regimens. Currently, data are insufficient to recommend etravirine or rilpivirine-based regimens as initial therapy inchildren. Etravirine is licensed for management of treatment-experienced adults and children aged 6 yearsand rilpivirine is licensed only for adults. Preferred Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Efavirenz as Preferred Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (For Children Aged 3 Years) (AI*) In clinical trials in HIV-infected adults, efavirenz in combination with two NRTIs has been associated with excellent virologic response. Efavirenz-based regimens have proven virologically superior or two NRTIs or with a NRTI and a PI has been studied in HIV-infectedchildren 17-23with results comparable to those seen in adults. For children aged 3 years who are unable to swallow pills, efavirenz capsules can be opened and sprinkled on age-appropriate food. Bioequivalence databased on bioavailability and PK support this option. 24 The major limitations of efavirenz are central nervous system (CNS) side effects in both children and adults;reported adverse effects include fatigue, poor sleeping patterns, vivid dreams, poor concentration, agitation,depression, and suicidal ideation. Although in most patients this toxicity is transient, in some, the symptomsmay persist or occur months after initiating efavirenz. In several studies, the incidence of such adverseeffects was correlated with efavirenz plasma concentrations and the occurrence was more frequent in adultswith higher levels of drug. 25-28The ENCORE 1study in adults has demonstrated that a dose of 400 mg of efavirenz is associated with fewer adverse events but non-inferior virologic response when compared withthe recommended 600-mg dose of efavirenz in adults. 29In patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, efavirenz should be used cautiously for initial therapy. Rash may also occur with efavirenz treatment; it isgenerally mild and transient but appears to be more common in children than adults. 21,23In addition, first- trimester exposure to efavirenz is potentially teratogenic (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information). Although emerging information about the use of efavirenz inGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-5pregnancy is reassuring,30-33alternative regimens that do not include efavirenz should be strongly considered in adolescent females who are trying to conceive or who are not using effective and consistent contraception, because of the potential for teratogenicity with first-trimester efavirenz exposure, assuming these alternativeregimens are acceptable to the provider and will not compromise the woman's health (BIII). Alternative Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (AI) Nevirapine has extensive clinical and safety experience in HIV-infected children and has shown ARV efficacy in a variety of combination regimens (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information).34Nevirapine in combination with two NRTIs or with a NRTI and a PI has been studied in HIV-infected children.1-4,35-37 Randomized clinical trials in adults have not demonstrated virologic inferiority for a nevirapine-basedregimen compared to either efavirenz or atazanavir-based regimens. 38,39 Randomized clinical trials in children have demonstrated conflicting results. In the P1060 trial of childrenaged <3 years, a nevirapine-based regimen was less effective compared to a lopinavir/ritonavir regimen,regardless of prior history of maternal nevirapine exposure. 1,2In PENPACT-1 and PROMOTE-pediatrics, there was no difference in virologic suppression between NNRTI-based and PI-based regimens (see Choice of NNRTI- Versus PI-Based Initial Regimens ). However, interpretation of these studies is complicated by the fact that the children in P1060 were younger than those in PROMOTE-pediatrics and PENPACT-1.Furthermore, efavirenz was allowed in PROMOTE-pediatrics and PENPACT-1 and was preferentiallyprescribed to older children. Comparisons of a nevirapine-based regimen and an efavirenz-based regimen inchildren in non-randomized studies have suggested that efavirenz is more effective but it is usually used inolder children. 40-42 In addition to concerns about virologic efficacy, adult randomized clinical trials have demonstrated higher ratesof toxicity and drug discontinuation in the nevirapine arms. 38,39Data in adults indicate that symptomatic hepatic toxicity is more frequent in individuals with higher CD4 cell counts and in women, particularly women withCD4 cell counts >250 cells/mm 3and men with CD4 cell counts >400 cells/mm3. In the published literature, hepatic toxicity appears to be less frequent in children receiving chronic nevirapine therapy than inadults. 36,37,43,44Although there is limited evidence in children of hepatic toxicity associated with CD4 cell count, overall toxicity has been reported to be more frequent among children with CD4 percentage 15% at therapyinitiation. 45The safety of substituting efavirenz for nevirapine in patients who have experienced nevirapine- associated hepatic toxicity is unknown. Efavirenz use in this situation has been well tolerated in the very limitednumber of patients in whom it has been reported, but this substitution should be attempted with caution. 46 Nevirapine-based regimens are considered an alternative rather than the preferred NNRTI in children aged3 years because of the greater potential for toxicity and possibly increased risk of virologic failure. Inchildren aged <3 years, nevirapine is considered an alternative because of increased risk of virologic failurecompared to a PI lopinavir/ritonavir regimen. Nevirapine should not be used as part of an initial therapy regimen in postpubertal adolescent girls with CD4 cell counts >250/mm 3because of the increased risk of symptomatic hepatic toxicity, unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.8Nevirapine also should be used with caution in children with elevated pretreatment liver function tests. Protease Inhibitor-Based excellent virologic potency, high barrier for development of drug resistance (requires multiple mutations), and sparing of the NNRTI drug class. However, because PIs areGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-6metabolized via hepatic enzymes, the drugs have potential for multiple drug interactions. They may also be associated with metabolic complications such as dyslipidemia, fat maldistribution, and insulin resistance.Factors to consider in selecting a PI-based regimen for treatment-naive children include virologic potency,dosing frequency, pill burden, food or fluid requirements, availability of palatable pediatric formulations,drug interaction profile, toxicity profile (particularly related to metabolic complications), age of the child,and availability of data in children. ( Table 9 lists the advantages and disadvantages of PIs. See Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed pediatric information on each drug.) Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme and can used in lowdoses as a PK booster when co-administered with some PIs, increasing drug exposure by prolonging the half-life of the boosted PI. Currently only lopinavir/ritonavir is available as a co-formulated product. Whenritonavir is used as a PI booster with other PIs, two agents must be administered. In addition, the use of low-dose ritonavir increases the potential for hyperlipidemia 47and drug-drug interactions. recommends ritonavir or co-formulated lopinavir/ritonavir as thepreferred PI for initial therapy in children based on virologic potency in adult and pediatric studies, highbarrier to development of drug resistance, excellent toxicity profile in adults and children, availability ofappropriate dosing information, and experience as initial therapy in both resource-rich and resource-limitedareas. Darunavir/ritonavir is considered an alternative PI regimen. Several regimens including unboostedatazanavir in adolescents aged 13 years, fosamprenavir/ritonavir in children aged 6 months, and nelfinavirare considered appropriate for use in special circumstances when preferred and alternative drugs are notavailable or are not tolerated. Preferred Protease Inhibitors Atazanavir with Low-Dose Ritonavir as Preferred Protease Children 6 Years) (AI*) Atazanavir is a once-daily PI that was approved by the FDA in March 2008 for use in children aged 6 years. Approval was extended in 2014 for use in infants and children aged 3 months and weighing 10 kg. It hasefficacy equivalent to efavirenz-based and lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination therapy when given incombination with two NRTIs in treatment-naive adults. 9,48-50Seventy-three percent of 48 treatment-naive South African children achieved viral load <400 copies/mL by 48 weeks when given atazanavir with orwithout ritonavir in combination with 2 NRTIs. 51Among 43 treatment-naive children aged 6 to 18 years in IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A who received the capsule formulation of atazanavir with or withoutritonavir, 51% and 47% achieved low-dose ritonavir boosting, atazanavir achieves enhanced concentrations compared with the unboosted drug in adults and children aged 6 years54-56and in ARV-naive adults, appears to be associated with fewer PI-resistance mutations at virologic failure compared with atazanavir givenwithout ritonavir boosting. 57,58The main adverse effect associated with atazanavir/ritonavir is indirect hyperbilirubinemia, with or without jaundice or scleral icterus, but without concomitant hepatic transaminaseelevations. Although atazanavir is associated with fewer lipid abnormalities than other PIs, lipid levels arehigher with low-dose ritonavir boosting than with atazanavir alone. 47Although atazanavir with low-dose ritonavir is approved for use in infants as young as 3 months, the Panel does not endorse usage as a preferredregimen in infants and children younger than 6 years due to lack of experience and concern about efficacy.Efficacy studies of atazanavir are ongoing in infants and children aged <6 years. Lopinavir with Low-Dose Ritonavir as Preferred Protease Inhibitor (for Infants with a Postmenstrual Aged 42 Weeks and Postnatal Age 14 Days) (AI) In clinical trials of treatment-naive adults, regimens containing lopinavir/ritonavir plus 2 NRTIs have been demonstrated to be comparable to a variety of other regimens including atazanavir, darunavir (at 48 weeks),fosamprenavir, saquinavir/ritonavir, and efavirenz. Lopinavir/ritonavir was to have superiorvirologic activity when compared to nelfinavir. 11,48,50,59-64Lopinavir/ritonavir has been studied in both ARV- naive and ARV-experienced children and has demonstrated durable virologic activity and low toxicity (seeGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-7Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information).1,65-71In addition, dosing and efficacy data in infants as young as age 25 days are available.68,72Post-marketing reports of lopinavir/ritonavir-associated cardiac toxicity (including complete atrioventricular block, bradycardia, and cardiomyopathy), lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, CNS depression, and respiratory complications leadingto death have been reported, predominantly in preterm neonates. These reports have resulted in a change inlopinavir/ritonavir labeling including a recommendation to not administer the combination to neonates until they reach a postmenstrual age (first day of the mother's last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsedafter birth) of 42 weeks and a postnatal age of at least 14 days. In addition, although once-dailylopinavir/ritonavir is FDA-approved for initial therapy in adults, 73PK data in children do not support a recommendation for once-daily dosing in children.74,75A recent study of 173 virologically suppressed children (median age 11 years) on twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir were randomized to continue twice dailydosing or change to once-daily dosing. At 48 weeks, non-inferiority for viral load suppression was notdemonstrated and lopinavir drug exposure was lower among participants with once-daily dosing. Theseresults suggest that lopinavir/ritonavir should only be administered twice daily in children. 76 Alternative Protease Inhibitors Atazanavir with Low-Dose Ritonavir as Alternative Protease Inhibitor (for Children 3 Months and <6 Years Who Weigh >10 kg) (AI*) Atazanavir in a powder formulation to be administered once daily with liquid low-dose ritonavir was approved by the FDA in 2014 for use in infants and children aged 3 months and weighing 10 kg based onfindings of two open-label clinical trials, PRINCE I and PRINCE II. 58Sixty-five infants and children weighing between 10 and 25 kg were studied. Using a weight band approach for determining dose, PKtargets were met. The drug was well tolerated and among 41 naive infants and children, 27 (66%) achievedHIV RNA levels <50 copies at week 48. Because of the limited experience with this agent in youngerchildren, the Panel recommends atazanavir with low-dose ritonavir as alternative PI therapy in infants andchildren aged >3 months and weighing between 10 and 25 kg. Darunavir with Low-Dose Ritonavir Administered Once Daily as Alternative Protease Inhibitor (for Children Aged 12 Years) or Twice Daily (for Children Aged 3 to 12 Years) (AI*) Darunavir combined with low-dose ritonavir is FDA-approved -experienced adults and for ARV-naive and -experienced children aged 3 years. In a randomized, open-label trial in adults,darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) was found to be non-inferior to lopinavir/ritonavir (once ortwice daily) when both boosted PIs were administered in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate(tenofovir)/emtricitabine. Adverse events were also less common in the darunavir/ritonavir group ( P< 0.01). 59,77Unfortunately, there is limited information about the use of darunavir combined with low-dose ritonavir as part of an initial therapy regimen for HIV-infected children. To date the only clinical trial ofdarunavir with low-dose ritonavir as initial therapy is a study of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir in treatment-naive adolescents aged 12 to 18 years (mean age, 14.6 years). After 24 weeks of treatment, 11 of 12participants had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL and the agents were well tolerated. 78,79 Data in treatment-experienced children have also demonstrated that the regimen is effective and well-tolerated. In a study of treatment-experienced children (aged 6-17 years), DELPHI, twice-dailydarunavir/ritonavir-based therapy was well tolerated and 48% of the children achieved HIV-1 RNA <50copies/mL by 48 weeks. 80In another study of treatment-experienced pediatric participants (aged 3 to <6 years and weight 10 kg to <20 kg), ARIEL, 57% of subjects had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL and 81% wereless than 400 copies/mL after 24 weeks of treatment. 81Twenty children completed the trial; 1 stopped prematurely because of vomiting. Based on data from these studies and the findings of high potency and lowtoxicity in adults, darunavir/ritonavir is recommended as an alternative agent for initial therapy in HIV-infected children. Some experts, however, would only recommend darunavir/ritonavir fortreatment-experienced children and reserve its use for patients with resistant mutations to other PIs. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-8As noted above, darunavir/ritonavir is approved for once-daily use in adults and children. In addition to the DELPHI study noted above, a PK study of 24 patients, aged 14 to 23 years receiving once-daily darunavir,demonstrated darunavir exposure similar to that in adults receiving once-daily therapy\u2014although there was atrend toward lower exposures in those aged <18 years. 82Also, in the ARIEL study, 10 treatment-experienced children were switched from twice-daily dosing to once-daily dosing after 24 weeks of therapy. PK studieswere performed after 2 weeks of once-daily dosing and demonstrated darunavir mean area under the curve24-hour equivalent to 128% of the adult AUC 24 hour. 83Based on these findings, the FDA has approved use of once-daily darunavir in children. At this time, the Panel recommends that once-daily dosing ofdarunavir/ritonavir as alternative initial therapy be considered only in treatment-naive adolescents aged >12years. Additional experience with once-daily dosing of darunavir/ritonavir in children aged 3 years throughage 12 years is awaited. Also, if not be used. Ifdarunavir/ritonavir is used as alternative therapy in children aged <12 years or if any of these resistance-associated substitutions are present, the Panel recommends twice-daily dosing. PIs for Use in Special Circumstances Atazanavir without Ritonavir Boosting in Children Aged 13 Years (BII*) Although unboosted atazanavir is FDA-approved for treatment-naive adolescents aged 13 years who weigh >39 kg and are unable to tolerate ritonavir, data from the IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A study indicate thathigher doses of unboosted atazanavir (on a mg/m 2basis) are required in adolescents than in adults to achieve adequate drug concentrations56(see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information on dosing used in IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A). If using unboosted atazanavir in treatment-naive patients, clinicians should consider using a dual-NRTI combination other than didanosine/emtricitabinebecause this combination demonstrated inferior virologic response in adults in ACTG 5175. 84Also, unboosted atazanavir should not be used in combination with tenofovir because concomitant administrationresults in lower atazanavir exposure. If didanosine, emtricitabine, and atazanavir are used in combination, patients should be instructed to take didanosine and atazanavir at least 2 hours apart, to take atazanavir withfood, and to take didanosine on an empty stomach. The complexity of this regimen argues against its use. Fosamprenavir with Low-Dose Ritonavir as Alternative Protease Inhibitor (for 6 Months) (AI*) Fosamprenavir (the prodrug of amprenavir) is available in a pediatric liquid formulation and a tablet formulation. In an adult clinical trial, fosamprenavir with low-dose ritonavir was demonstrated to benoninferior to lopinavir/ritonavir. 61In June 2007, fosamprenavir suspension was FDA-approved for use in pediatric patients aged 2 years. The approval was based on two open-label studies in pediatric patients aged2 to18 years. 85,86PK, safety and efficacy were assessed in an international study of PI-naive and PI- experienced pediatric patients, aged 4 weeks to 2 years.87,88Overall, fosamprenavir was well tolerated except for vomiting and effective in suppressing viral load and increasing CD4 cell count (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information). These data supported FDA approval for use in PI-naive children as young as 4 weeks who were born at 38 weeks' gestation and had attained apostnatal age of 28 days. Young infants, however, demonstrated low drug exposure. Fosamprenavir shouldalways be used in combination with low-dose ritonavir boosting and only for children aged 6 months.Once-daily dosing of fosamprenavir is not recommended for pediatric patients. Nelfinavir for Children Aged 2 Years (BI*) Nelfinavir in combination with 2 NRTIs is an acceptable PI choice for initial treatment of children aged 2 years in special circumstances. The pediatric experience with nelfinavir-based regimens in ARV-naive andARV-experienced children is extensive, with follow-up in children receiving the regimen for as long as 7years. 89The drug has been well tolerated; diarrhea is the primary adverse effect. However, in clinical studies the virologic potency of nelfinavir has varied greatly, with reported rates of virologic suppression rangingGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-9from 26% to 69% (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information). Several studies have shown a correlation between nelfinavir trough concentrations and virologic response in treatment-naive pediatric patients.90In one such study, virologic response at Week 48 was observed in 29% of children with subtherapeutic nelfinavir interpatient variability in plasma concentrations is great in children, with lower levels in younger children.91-96The optimal dose of nelfinavir in younger children, particularly in those aged <2 years, has not been well defined. These data, combined with data in adults showing inferiorpotency of nelfinavir compared with other PIs and efavirenz, balanced against the advantage of a PI that isnot coadministered with low-dose ritonavir for boosting, 64,97-100make nelfinavir an agent for use in special circumstances in treatment-naive children aged 2 years and not recommended for treatment of childrenaged <2 years. Nelfinavir is currently available only as tablets, which can be dissolved in water or other liquids to make a slurry that is then ingested by children unable to swallow whole tablets. Dissolving nelfinavir tablets in waterand swallowing whole tablets resulted in comparable PK parameters in a study in adults. 101 Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Based is FDA-approved for treatment of HIV-infected children aged 4 weeks and weighing 3 kg. It is available in film-coated tablets, chewable tablets, and single packets of granules for oral suspension.Raltegravir has a favorable safety profile and lacks significant drug interactions. The Panel considersraltegravir an alternative INSTI in children aged 2 years who are able to take either the chewable or film-coated tablets. The tablet formulations are not interchangeable (they are not bio-equivalent), and therefore,require different dosing. Safety and efficacy data are promising, but at this time, there are little data onraltegravir use as initial therapy in HIV-infected infants and children. 102-104 Dolutegravir has recently been approved by the FDA for use in children aged 12 years and weighing 40kg. The approval was supported by data from a study of 23 treatment-experienced but INSTI-naive childrenand adolescents. 105The drug has a very favorable safety profile and can be dosed once daily in treatment of INSTI-naive patients. Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors for Use in Special Circumstances Raltegravir can be considered for use in special circumstances in infants and children aged 4 weeks to 2 years. At this time, there is limited information about the use of single packets of granules for oral suspensionin children aged <2 years. For this group of children, raltegravir granules may be considered as initialtherapy in special circumstances. 102-104 Selection of Dual-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor Backbone as Part of Initial Combination Therapy Summary: Selection of Dual-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor Backbone Regimen Dual-NRTI combinations form the backbone of combination regimens for both adults and children. Currently, children aged <13 years. Dual-NRTI combinations that have been studied inchildren include in with stavudine orGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-10didanosine; and tenofovir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine.19,54,89,95,106-114Advantages and disadvantages of different dual-NRTI backbone options are delineated in Table 9 . In the dual-NRTI regimens listed below, lamivudine and emtricitabine are interchangeable. Both lamivudine and emtricitabine are well tolerated with few adverse effects. Although there is less experience in childrenwith emtricitabine than with lamivudine, it is similar to lamivudine and can be substituted for lamivudine asone component of a preferred dual-NRTI backbone (i.e., emtricitabine in combination with abacavir ortenofovir or zidovudine). The main advantage of emtricitabine over lamivudine is that it can be administeredonce daily as part of an initial regimen. Both lamivudine and emtricitabine select for the M184V resistancemutation, which is associated with high-level resistance to both drugs; a modest decrease in susceptibility toabacavir and didanosine, and improved susceptibility to zidovudine, stavudine, and Abacavir in Combination with Lamivudine or Emtricitabine (for Children 3 Months) (AI) Abacavir in combination with lamivudine has been shown to be as potent as or possibly more potent than zidovudine in combination with lamivudine in both children and adults.117,118In 5 years of follow-up, abacavir plus lamivudine maintained significantly better viral suppression and growth in children than didzidovudine plus lamivudine and zidovudine plus abacavir. 118However, retrospective observational data from African children aged <16 years suggests the possibility of worse virologic outcome withabacavir/lamivudine based first-line cART when compared to the stavudine/lamivudine-based first-linecART. 119,120Multiple confounders could have contributed to these findings and further data collection and evaluation is warranted. Additionally, abacavir/lamivudine or emtricitabine has the potential for abacavir-associated life-threatening HSRs in a small proportion of patients. Abacavir hypersensitivity is morecommon in individuals with certain HLA genotypes, particularly HLA-B*5701 (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ); however, in the United States, the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 is much lower in African Americans and Hispanics (2% to 2.5%) than in whites (8%).121Prevalence in Thai and Cambodian children is approximately 4%.122Pretreatment screening for HLA-B*5701 before initiation of abacavir treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of abacavir HSRs in HIV-infected in HIV-infected children, genetic screening for HLA-B*5701 should be performed and children who test positive for HLA-B*5701 should not receiveabacavir (AII*). An advantage of an abacavir regimen is the potential to switch to once-daily dosing in children with undetectable plasma RNA after approximately 24 weeks of therapy. Three small studies have nowdemonstrated equivalent drug exposure following a change from a twice-daily to a once-daily dosingregimen in children aged 3 months who had undetectable or low, stable plasma RNA after a variable periodof twice-daily abacavir dosing. Two of the three demonstrated continued virologic suppression and one didnot assess viral suppression. 124-127Recently, the ARROW trial reported findings from 669 HIV-infected children who had been receiving abacavir and lamivudine twice daily for 36 weeks and were randomized toeither continue twice-daily dosing or in terms of viral suppression; 128therefore, the Panel suggests that in clinically stable patients with undetectable plasma RNA and stable CD4 cell counts for more than 6 months,switching from twice-daily to once-daily dosing of abacavir is recommended as part of a once-daily regimen. Tenofovir in Combination with Lamivudine or Emtricitabine (for Adolescents, Tanner Stage 4 or 5) (AI*) Tenofovir is FDA-approved for use in children and adolescents aged 2 years. Because of decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) observed in adults and children receiving tenofovir, the Panel has opted to consider use of tenofovir based on Tanner stage. We have reserved our strongest recommendation in support of usingGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-11tenofovir for adolescents who are in the late stages of or who have completed puberty (Tanner stages 4 and 5). Tenofovir can be used in younger children after weighing potential risks of decreased BMD versus benefits of therapy . In comparative clinical trials in adults, tenofovir when used with lamivudine or emtricitabine as a dual- NRTI backbone was superior to zidovudine with lamivudine and efavirenz in viral efficacy.129,130In ACTG 5202, adults who had a screening HIV-1 RNA 100,000 copies/mL receiving tenofovir/emtricitabine as part ofa cAR T regimen had a longer time to virologic failure and to first adverse event compared to those assigned to abacavir/lamivudine.131However, this has not been demonstrated in other comparative trials or in a meta- analysis.132,133Tenofovir has been studied in HIV-infected children in combination with other NRTIs and as an oral sprinkle/granule formulation.109-112The use of tenofovir in pediatric patients aged 2 years to <18 years is approved by the FDA based on data from 2 randomized studies. In study 321, 87 treatment-experiencedsubjects aged 12 to <18 years were randomized to receive tenofovir or placebo plus optimized backgroundregimen for 48 weeks. Although there was no difference in virologic response between the two groups, thesafety and PKs of tenofovir in children in the study were similar to those in adults receiving tenofovir. 113In study 352, ninety-two treatment-experienced children aged 2 years <18 years with virologic suppression onstavudine- or zidovudine-containing to either replace stavudine or zidovudine withtenofovir or to continue their original regimen. After 48 weeks, 89% of subjects receiving tenofovir and 90% ofsubjects continuing their original regimen had HIV-1 RNA concentrations <400 copies/mL. 114Tenofovir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine is a preferred dual-NRTI combination for use in adolescentsTanner Stage 4 or 5 (AI*). The fixed-dose combination of and allow for once-daily dosing, which may helpimprove adherence in older adolescents. In some but not all studies, decreases in BMD have been observed in both adults and children takingtenofovir for 48 weeks. 109-112,134,135At this time, data are insufficient to recommend use of tenofovir as part of a preferred regimen for initial therapy in infected children in Tanner Stages 1 through 3, for whom the risk ofbone toxicity may be greatest 109,112(see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for more detailed pediatric information). It is important to note that although decreases in BMD are observed, theclinical significance of these changes is not yet known. Renal toxicity has been reported in children receivingtenofovir. 136-139Given the potential for bone and renal toxicity, tenofovir may be more useful for treatment of children in whom other ARV drugs have failed than for initial therapy of treatment-naive younger children.Numerous drug-drug interactions with tenofovir and other ARV drugs, including didanosine,lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, and tipranavir, complicate appropriate dosing of tenofovir. Both emtricitabine and lamivudine, and tenofovir have antiviral activity and efficacy against hepatitis B virus (HBV). For a comprehensive review of this topic and interactions of ARV drugs with treatment for hepatitisC virus (HCV) and tuberculosis the reader should access the Pediatric Opportunistic Infections Guidelines . Zidovudine in Combination with Lamivudine or Emtricitabine (For Children Aged <13 Years) (AI*) The most extensive experience in children is with zidovudine in combination with lamivudine. Data on the safety of this combination in children are extensive and the combination is generally well tolerated.140The major toxicities associated with zidovudine/lamivudine are bone marrow suppression, manifested asmacrocytic anemia and neutropenia, and an association with lipoatrophy; minor toxicities includegastrointestinal toxicity and fatigue. In addition, the combination of zidovudine and lamivudine is acceptablein infants less than 3 months. Because zidovudine must be administered twice daily, use in adolescents (aged13 years) is an alternative rather than a preferred agent. Alternative Dual-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor Regimens Alternative combination abacavir or didanosine didanosine (BI*), zidovudine with lamivudine or emtricitabine in adolescents (aged 13 years) (AI*), and tenofovir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine in children and adolescents who are Tanner Stage 3 (as opposed to Tanner Stages 4 and 5,Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-12where this is a preferred dual-NRTI regimen) (BI*). There is considerable experience with use of these dual- NRTI regimens in children, and in a large pediatric study, the combination of zidovudine and didanosine had the lowest rate of toxicities.140However, zidovudine/abacavir and zidovudine/lamivudine had lower rates of viral suppression and more toxicity leading to drug modification than did abacavir/lamivudine in a Europeanpediatric study. 95,118The combination of didanosine and emtricitabine allows for once-daily dosing. In a study of 37 treatment-naive children aged 3 to 21 years, long-term virologic suppression was achieved with aonce-daily regimen of didanosine, emtricitabine, and efavirenz; 72% of subjects maintained HIV RNAsuppression to <50 copies/mL through 96 weeks of therapy. 19Prescribing information for didanosine recommends administration on an empty stomach. However, this is impractical for infants who must be fedfrequently and it may decrease medication adherence in older children because of the complexity of theregimen. A comparison of didanosine given with or without food in children found that systemic exposurewas similar but with slower and more prolonged absorption with food. 141To improve adherence, some practitioners recommend administration of didanosine without regard to timing of meals for young children.However, data are inadequate to allow a strong recommendation at this time, and it is preferable toadminister didanosine under fasting conditions when possible. Dual-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor Backbone Regimens for Use in Special Circumstances The dual-NRTI combinations of stavudine with lamivudine or emtricitabine in children of any age are recommended for use in special circumstances. Stavudine is recommended for use only in specialcircumstances because the ARV is associated with a higher risk of lipoatrophy and hyperlactatemia thanother NRTI drugs. 142-147Children receiving dual-NRTI combinations containing stavudine had higher rates of clinical and laboratory toxicities than children receiving zidovudine-containing combinations.140However, in a prospective study, 365 treatment-naive children were randomized to stavudine, zidovudine, or abacavir aspart of a cART regimen. After 96 weeks, there were no differences in overall tolerability, CD4 change, orvirologic response among the groups. There was no difference in skinfold z-scores among the groups,however, 2 children randomized to stavudine underwent a drug substitution due to lipodystrophy. 148In children with anemia in whom there are concerns related to abacavir hypersensitivity or who are too youngto receive abacavir or tenofovir, stavudine may be preferable to zidovudine for initial therapy because of itslower incidence of hematologic toxicity. In children aged 2 years and those who are prepubertal or in the early stages of puberty (Tanner Stages 1 and 2), tenofovir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine is also recommended for use in specialcircumstances. As discussed above, the use of tenofovir during puberty when bone toxicity may be greatestmay require caution. However, tenofovir may be a reasonable choice for initial therapy in children withdemonstrated resistance to other NRTIs, coinfection with hepatitis B virus, or in those desiring a once-dailyNRTI where abacavir is not an option. The Panel awaits additional safety data, especially with the recentlylicensed powder formulation, before providing a broader recommendation in younger children. Both emtricitabine and lamivudine, and tenofovir have antiviral activity and efficacy against hepatitis B.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-13Table 8. ARV Regimens Recommended for Initial Therapy for HIV Infection in Children (page 1 of 2) A cART regimen in treatment-naive children generally contains one NNRTI plus a two-NRTI backbone or one PI (generally with low-dose ritonavir boosting) plus a two-NRTI backbone. Regimens should beindividualized based on advantages and disadvantages of each combination (see Table 9 ). Preferred Regimens Children aged 14 days to <3 yearsa Two NRTIs plus LPV/r Children aged 3 years to <6 years Two NRTIs plus EFVb Two NRTIs plus LPV/r Children aged 6 years Two NRTIs plus ATV plus low-dose RTV Two NRTIs plus NRTIs Children aged >14 days Two NRTIs plus NVPc Children aged 3 months to <6 years and weighing 10 kg Two NRTIs plus ATV plus low-dose RTV Children aged 2 years Two NRTIs plus RALd Children aged 3 years to <12 years Two NRTIs plus twice-daily DRV plus low-dose plus once-daily DRV plus low-dose RTVe Children aged 12 years and weighing 40 kg Two NRTIs plus DTG Regimens for Use in Special Circumstances Children aged 4 weeks and <2 years and weighing 3 kg Two NRTIs plus RALd Children aged 6 months Two NRTIs plus FPVfplus low-dose RTV Children aged 2 years Two NRTIs plus NFV Treatment-naive adolescents aged 13 years and weighing >39 kg Two NRTIs plus ATV unboosted Preferred 2-NRTI Backbone Options for Use in Combination with Additional Drugs Children, birth to 3 months ZDV plus (3TC or FTC) Children aged 3 months and 12 years ABC plus (3TC or FTC) ZDV plus (3TC or FTC) Adolescents aged 13 years at Tanner Stage 3 ABC plus (3TC or FTC) Adolescents at Tanner Stage 4 or 5 ABC plus (3TC or FTC) TDF plus (3TC or FTC) Alternative 2-NRTI Backbone Options for Use in Combination with Additional Drugs Children aged 2 weeks ddI plus (3TC or FTC) ZDV plus ddI Children 3 months ZDV plus ABC Children and adolescents at Tanner Stage 3 TDF plus (3TC or FTC) Adolescents 13 years ZDV plus (3TC or FTC) 2-NRTI Regimens for Use in Special Circumstances d4T plus (3TC or FTC) TDF plus (3TC or FTC) (prepubertal children aged 2 years and adolescents, Tanner Stage 1 or 2)in Combination with Additional DrugsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-14aLPV/r should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age (first day of the mother's last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsed after birth) of 42 weeks and postnatal age 14 days. bEFV is licensed for use in children aged 3 months who weigh 3.5 kg but is not recommended by the Panel as initial therapy in children aged 3 months to 3 years. Unless adequate contraception can be ensured, EFV-based therapy is not recommended for adolescent females who are sexually active and may become pregnant. cNVP should not be used in postpubertal girls with CD4 cell count >250/mm3, unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. NVP is FDA-approved for treatment of infants aged 15 days. dRAL pills or chewable tablets can be used in children aged 2 years as an alternate INSTI. Use of granules or chewable tablets in infants and children aged 4 weeks to 2 years can be considered in special circumstances. eDRV once daily should not be used if any one of the following resistance-associated only be administered to infants born at 38 weeks' gestation who have attained a postnatal age of 28 days and to infants born before 38 weeks' gestation who have reached a postmenstrual age of 42 weeks. Key to Acronyms: 3TC = lamivudine; ABC = abacavir; ARV = antiretroviral; ATV = atazanavir; cART = combination antiretroviral therapy; : half-life Less dyslipidemia and fat maldistribution than PIs PI-sparing Lower pill burden than PIs for children taking solid formulation; easier to use andadhere to than PI-based regimens.NNRTI Class Disadvantages : Single mutation can confer resistance, with cross resistance between EFV and NVP . Rare but serious and potentially life-threatening cases of skin rash, including SJS, and hepatictoxicity with all NNRTIs (but highest withnevirapine) Potential for multiple drug interactions due to metabolism via hepatic enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4) EFV Potent ARV activity Once-daily administration Can give with food (but avoid high-fat meals). Capsules can be opened and added to food. Neuropsychiatric adverse effects (bedtime dosing recommended to reduce CNS effects). Rash (generally mild) No commercially available liquid Limited data on dosing for children aged <3 years. No data on dosing for children aged <3 months Use with caution in adolescent females of childbearing age. NVP Liquid formulation available. Dosing information for young infants available. Can give with food. Extended-release formulation is available that allows for once-daily dosing in olderchildren. Reduced virologic efficacy in young infants, regardless of exposure to NVP as part of aperipartum preventive regimen Higher incidence of rash/HSR than other NNRTIs Higher rates of serious hepatic toxicity than EFV Decreased virologic response compared with EFV dosing necessary in children with BSA < 0.58 m2Table 9. Advantages and Disadvantages of Antiretroviral Components Recommended for Initial Therapy in Childrena (page 1 of 4)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-15ARV ClassARV Agent(s)Advantages Disadvantages PIs In Alphabetical OrderPI Class Advantages : NNRTI-sparing Clinical, virologic, and immunologic efficacy well documented. Resistance to PIs requires multiple mutations. When combined with dual NRTI backbone, targets HIV at two steps of viral replication(viral reverse transcriptase and proteaseenzymes).PI Class Disadvantages : Metabolic complications including dyslipidemia, fat maldistribution, insulin resistance Potential for multiple drug interactions because of metabolism via hepatic enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4). Higher pill burden than NRTI- or NNRTI-based regimens for patients taking solid formulations Poor palatability of liquid preparations, which may affect adherence to treatment regimen Most PIs require low-dose ritonavir boosting resulting in associated drug interactions. ATV/r Once-daily dosing Powder formulation available ATV has less effect on TG and total cholesterol levels than other PIs (but RTVboosting may be associated withelevations in these parameters). No liquid formulation Food effect (should be administered with food). Indirect hyperbilirubinemia common but asymptomatic. Must be used with caution in patients with pre- existing conduction system defects (can prolongPR interval of ECG). RTV component associated with large number of drug interactions (see RTV). ATV Once-daily dosing Powder formulation available Less effect on TG and total cholesterol levels than other PIs. No liquid formulation Food effect (should be administered with food) Indirect hyperbilirubinemia common but asymptomatic Must be used with caution in patients with pre- existing conduction system defects (can prolongPR interval of ECG). May require RTV boosting in treatment-naive adolescents to achieve adequate plasmaconcentrations. Unboosted ATV cannot be used with TDF. DRV/r Effective in PI-experienced children when given with low-dose RTV boosting. Can be used once daily in children aged 12 years. Liquid formulation available Pediatric pill burden high with current tablet dose formulations. Food effect (should be given with food). Must be given with RTV boosting to achieve adequate plasma concentrations. Contains sulfa moiety. The potential for cross sensitivity between DRV and other drugs insulfonamide class is unknown. RTV component associated with large number of drug interactions (see RTV). Can only be used once daily in absence of certain PI-associated resistance mutations.Table 9.

Should only be administered to infants born at 38 weeks' gestation and who have attained apostnatal age of 28 days. LPV/r LPV only available co-formulated with RTV in liquid and tablet formulations. Tablets can be given without regard to food but may be better tolerated whentaken with meal or snack. Poor palatability of liquid formulation (bitter taste), although palatability of combinationbetter than RTV alone. Food effect (liquid formulation should be administered with food). RTV component associated with large number of drug interactions (see RTV). Should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age (first day of the mother's lastmenstrual period to birth plus the time elapsedafter birth) of 42 weeks and a postnatal age 14days. Must be used with caution in patients with pre- existing conduction system defects (can prolongPR and QT interval of ECG). NFV Can give with food. Simplified 2-tablet (625 mg) twice-daily regimen has a reduced pill burdencompared with other PI-containingregimens in older patients where the adultdose is appropriate. Diarrhea Food effect (should be administered with food). Appropriate dosage for younger children not well defined. Adolescents may require higher doses than adults. Less potent than boosted PIs.

Presented at: 6thInternational Workshop on HIV Pediatrics. 2014. Melbourne, Australia.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-27What Not to Start: Regimens Not Recommended for Initial Therapy of Antiretroviral- Naive Children (Last updated April 27, 2015; last reviewed April 27, 2015) Many additional antiretroviral (ARV) agents and combinations are available; some are not recommended for initial therapy, although they may be used in treatment-experienced children. This section describes ARVdrugs and drug combinations that are not recommended or for which data are insufficient to recommend usefor initial therapy in ARV-naive children. Not Recommended These include drugs and drug combinations that are not recommended for initial therapy in ARV-naive children because of inferior virologic response, potential serious safety concerns (including potentially overlappingtoxicities), or pharmacologic antagonism. These drugs and drug combinations are listed in Table 10 . Insufficient Data to Recommend Drugs and drug combinations approved for use in adults that have insufficient, limited, and/or nopharmacokinetic (PK) or safety data for children cannot be recommended as initial therapy in children.However, these drugs and drug combinations may be appropriate for consideration in management oftreatment-experienced children (see Management of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy ). These drugs are also listed in Table 10 . Antiretroviral Drugs and Combinations Not Recommended for Initial Therapy In addition to the regimens listed below, several ARVs\u2014including unboosted therapy. Enfuvirtide-Based Regimens Enfuvirtide, a fusion inhibitor, is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in combination with other ARV drugs to treat children aged 6 years who have evidence of HIV replication despite ongoingcombination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (i.e., treatment-experienced children on non-suppressiveregimens). Enfuvirtide is not recommended as initial therapy because the drug must be administeredsubcutaneously twice daily and is associated with a high incidence of local injection site reactions (98%). Fosamprenavir Without Ritonavir Boosting Fosamprenavir without ritonavir boosting has been studied in children aged 2 years but is not recommended because the large volume of fosamprenavir oral suspension necessary to administer in the absence ofritonavir boosting is prohibitive. In addition, low levels of exposure may result in selection of resistancemutations that are associated with darunavir resistance. Indinavir-Based Regimens Although adequate virologic and immunologic responses have been observed with indinavir-based regimens in adults, the drug is not available in a liquid formulation and high rates of hematuria, sterile leukocyturia,and nephrolithiasis have been reported in pediatric patients using indinavir. 1-4The incidence of hematuria and nephrolithiasis with indinavir therapy may be higher in children than adults.1,4Therefore, indinavir alone or with ritonavir boosting is not recommended as initial therapy in children. Regimens Containing Only Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors In adult trials, regimens containing only nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have shown less potent virologic activity when compared with more potent zidovudine plus abacavir plusGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-28lamivudine, stavudine plus didanosine lamivudine.5,6Data on the efficacy of triple-NRTI regimens for treatment of ARV-naive children are limited; in small observational studies, response rates of 47% to 50% have been reported.7,8In a study of the triple-NRTI regimen abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine in previously treated children, the combination showed evidence of only modest viral suppression, with only 10% of 102 children maintaining a viral load of <400 copies/mL at48 weeks of treatment. 9Therefore, regimens containing only NRTIs are not recommended. A possible exception to this recommendation is the treatment of young children (aged <3 years) with concomitant HIVinfection and tuberculosis for whom a nevirapine-based regimen is not acceptable. For these children, wheretreatment choices are limited, the World Health Organization recommends the use of a triple-NRTI regimen.10 Regimens Containing Three Drug Classes Data are insufficient to recommend initial regimens containing agents from three drug classes (e.g., NRTI plus NNRTI plus PI). Although studies containing three classes of drugs have demonstrated these regimensto be safe and effective in previously treated HIV-infected children and adolescents, these regimens have notbeen studied as initial therapy in treatment-naive children and adolescents and have the potential for inducingresistance to three drug classes, which could severely limit future treatment options. 11-15Ongoing studies, however, are investigating three drug classes as treatment in HIV-infected neonates. Regimens Containing Three NRTIs and an NNRTI Data are currently insufficient to recommend a regimen of three NRTIs plus an NNRTI in young infants. A recent review of nine cohorts from 13 European countries suggested superior responses to this four-drug regimen when compared to boosted PI or three-drug NRTI regimens.16There has been speculation that poor tolerance and adherence to a PI-based regimen may account for differences. The ARROW trial conducted in Uganda and Zimbabwe randomized 1,206 children (median age 6 years) to a standard NNR TI-based three-drug regimen versus a four-drug regimen (three NRTIs and an NNRTI). After a 36-week induction period, the children on the four-drug regimen were continued on a dual NRTI plus NNRTI or an all NRTI-based regimen. Although earlybenefits in CD4 T lymphocyte improvement and virologic control were observed in the four-drug arm, these benefits were not sustained after de-intensification to the three-NRTI arm.17Furthermore, after a median of 3.7 years on therapy, children in the initial four-drug arm who changed to an all NRTI-based regimen had significantly poorer virologic control.18Based on demonstrated benefits of recommended three-drug regimens and lack of additional efficacy data on the four-drug regimen, the Panel does not currently recommend this regimen. Saquinavir with Low-Dose Ritonavir A saquinavir/ritonavir-based regimen compared with a lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen demonstrated comparable virologic and immunologic outcomes when used as initial therapy in treatment-naive adults.19 However, saquinavir is not recommended for initial therapy in children because the agent is not available in apediatric formulation, and dosing and outcome data on saquinavir use in children are limited. Stavudine in Combination with Didanosine The dual-NRTI combination of stavudine/didanosine is not recommended for use as initial therapy because of greater toxicity when used in combination. In small pediatric studies, stavudine/didanosine demonstratedvirologic efficacy and was well tolerated. 20-22However, in studies in adults, stavudine plus didanosine-based combination regimens were associated with neurotoxicity, pancreatitis, hyperlactatemia andlactic acidosis, 23,24In addition, of fatal and non-fatal acidosis with pancreatitis/hepatic steatosis have been combination during pregnancy. 25,26 Tipranavir-Based Regimens This agent has been studied in treatment-experienced children and adults. Tipranavir is a PI licensed for useGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-29in children aged 2 years. Tipranavir-based regimens are not recommended because higher doses of ritonavir to boost tipranavir must be used and rare, but serious, cases of intracranial hemorrhage have been reported. Antiretroviral Drugs and Combinations with Data Insufficient to Recommend for Initial Therapy in Children A number of ARV drugs and drug regimens are not recommended for initial therapy in ARV-naive children or for specific age groups because of insufficient pediatric data. These include the dual-NRTI backbonecombinations abacavir/didanosine, abacavir/tenofovir, and didanosine/tenofovir. In addition, several newagents appear promising for use in adults but do not have sufficient pediatric PK and safety data torecommend their use as components of an initial therapeutic regimen in children. These agents includemaraviroc In addition, some dosing schedules may not be recommended in certain agegroups based on insufficient data. As new data become available, these agents may be considered asrecommended agents or regimens. These are summarized below and also listed in Table 10 . Darunavir with Low-Dose Ritonavir when Administered Once Daily (for Children Aged 3 to 12 Years) Data are limited on PK of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir in young children. While modeling studiesidentified a once-daily dosing regimen now approved by FDA, the Panel is concerned about the lack ofefficacy data for individuals aged 3 to <12 years treated with once-daily darunavir/ritonavir. Thereforeonce-daily dosing for initial therapy is not recommended in this age group. For children aged 3 to <12years, twice-daily darunavir boosted with ritonavir is an alternate PI regimen. For older children who haveundetectable viral load on twice-daily therapy with darunavir/ritonavir, practitioners can consider changingto once-daily treatment to enhance ease of use and support adherence if no darunavir-associated resistancemutations are present. Dolutegravir for Children Aged <12 Years Dolutegravir is an INSTI that has recently been approved by FDA for use in children 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg. At this time there is no information about its use in children aged <12 years, but aclinical trial in treatment-experienced children aged <12 years is under way. Efavirenz for Children Aged 3 Months to 3 Years Efavirenz is FDA-approved for use in children as young as 3 months who weigh at least 3.5 kg. Concerns regarding variable PK of the drug in the very young have resulted in a recommendation to not use efavirenzin children younger than 3 years at this time (see Efavirenz in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). Based on the recommended efavirenz dosage for children younger than 3 years, the IMPAACT P1070 study estimated the variability in area under the curve (AUC) for efavirenz based on polymorphismsin cytochrome P (CYP) 2B6 516. The suggest of extensive metabolizers would havesubtherapeutic AUCs and 67% of metabolizers excessive on recommendeddosing. 27Thus, be considered, CYP2B6 genotyping that predicts efavirenz metabolic rate should be performed, if available. Therapeutic drug monitoring can also be considered. Elvitegravir-Based Regimens Elvitegravir is an INSTI available as a tablet and as a fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir. It is FDA-approved for use as cART in HIV-1-infected cART-naive adults. Elvitegravir tablets must be taken in combination with a low-dose, ritonavir-boosted PI. Neitherformulation is FDA-approved for use in children aged <18 years. A small study (14 participants) of the fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir in treatment-naive childrenand adolescents, aged 12 to 17 years, has reported PK, tolerability, and virologic efficacy at 24 weeks. Thetherapy was well tolerated and all participants taking the cART at 24 weeks had viral loads less than 400copies/mL; 11 had viral loads less than 50 copies/mL. Steady state exposure was similar to that observed inGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection G-30adults, as were small increases in serum creatinine without evidence of nephrotoxicity. These data suggest that elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir is efficacious in children and adolescents aged 12 to 18years, but evidence is insufficient for this regimen to be recommended as initial therapy for treatment-naivechildren and adolescents in this age group. Etravirine-Based Regimens Etravirine is an NNRTI that has been studied in treatment-experienced children 6 years and older.28,29It is associated with multiple interactions with other ARVs, including tipranavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, and unboosted PIs, and must be administered twice daily. Studies in treatment-experienced younger children are under way . It is unlikely that etravirine will be studied in treatment-naive children. Rilpivirine-Based Regimens Rilpivirine is currently available both as a single-agent formulation and a once-daily, fixed-dose combination tablet containing emtricitabine and tenofovir. A recent study of rilpivirine, 25 mg daily in combination withtwo NRTIs in treatment-naive adolescents aged 12 to 18 years, demonstrated that the regimen was well-tolerated over 24 weeks. Among adolescents with baseline viral loads 100,000 copies/mL, 86% had avirologic response. 30In adult studies, reduced viral suppression was observed in patients with initial HIV RNA >100,000 copies/mL; similar reduced response was also observed in the pediatric study. In adults,rilpivirine is recommended only if HIV RNA is 100,000 copies/mL; it is not recommended as initialtherapy for treatment-naive children and adolescents, and if used in older children and adolescents (aged >12years) it should only be used if HIV RNA is <100,000 copies/mL. Maraviroc-Based Regimens Maraviroc is an entry inhibitor that has been used infrequently in children. A dose-finding study in treatment- experienced children aged 2 to 18 years is enrolling patients in four age cohorts using both liquid and tabletformulations. Initial dose is based on body surface area and scaled from recommended adult dosage. Doseadjustments were required in patients not receiving a potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor or inducer. 31The drug has multiple drug interactions and must be administered twice daily. In addition, tropism assays must beperformed prior to use to ensure the presence of only CCR5-tropic virus. Antiretroviral Drug Regimens that Should Never Be Recommended Several ARV drugs and drug regimens should never be recommended for use in therapy of children or adults. These are summarized in Table 11 . Clinicians should be aware of the components of fixed-drug combinations so that patients do not inadvertently receive a double dose of a drug contained in such a combination. Table 10.

Presented at: 7th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention. 2013. KualaLumpur, Malaysia.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection H-1Specific Issues in Antiretroviral Therapy for Neonates (Last updated March 5, 2015; last reviewed March 5, 2015) Existing pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data are insufficient for the recommendation of a complete combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen to treat preterm infants and term infants younger than 15days (until 42 weeks postmenstrual age). Until recently, neonatal antiretroviral (ARV) regimens were designed for prophylaxis of perinatal HIV transmission and to be as simple as possible for practical use in resource-poor countries. There was littlereason to develop ARV regimens for treatment of neonates, as the long turnaround times to receive HIVnucleic acid testing (NAT) results meant that neonatal infections were generally not diagnosed in the firstweeks of life. However, because HIV NAT test results now often are available within a few days, HIV-infected infants are being diagnosed as early as the first days of life. In addition, the recent case of prolongedremission of HIV infection in an infant from Mississippi has led to discussions about strategies to achieveprolonged virologic suppression of in utero HIV infection with early intensive ARV treatment and subsequent treatment interruption. 1This interest must be tempered by: Lack of evidence that very early treatment (before age 2 weeks) will produce a prolonged remission or lead to better outcomes in infected infants The very limited dosing and safety data for ARV drugs in the newborn period The potential for toxicity from ARV agents. Sufficient data exist to provide dosing recommendations appropriate for the treatment of HIV infection in neonates using the following medications: From birth in term and preterm infants: didanosine , nevirapine , and lopinavir/ritonavir For all other ARV drugs, PK and safety data are insufficient to allow recommendations for safe doses appropriate for use in HIV infected neonates. Data are insufficient on which to base a firm recommendation for treatment doses of nevirapine in newborn infants. Nevirapine PK data in neonates come from studies designed to identify doses appropriate forprophylaxis , not treatment, of HIV infection. The target plasma trough concentration in nevirapine perinatal prophylaxis studies was 0.1 microgram/mL, which would be inadequate for sustained therapeutic effect in anHIV infected individual. 2,3No neonatal PK data exist for regimens designed to achieve the suggested therapeutic plasma target trough concentration of 3.0 microgram/mL.4A population analysis of nevirapine PK data collected during the first year of life combining both prevention and treatment studies demonstratedthat nevirapine clearance is low immediately after birth and increases dramatically over the first months oflife. 5Simulations derived from this model suggest that 6 mg/kg of nevirapine administered twice daily to full-term infants in the first 4 weeks of life will maintain trough concentrations above 3.0 microgram/mL.This dose will be studied in the IMPAACT P1115 clinical trial . The experience with lopinavir\\ritonavir in neonates highlights the risk of using ARVs in neonates withoutneonatal PK and safety data. Life-threatening cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous system toxicity havebeen reported in 10 infants (8 preterm, 2 term) receiving lopinavir\\ritonavir oral solution during the firstweeks of life. These toxicities included bradycardia, complete atrioventricular block, heart failure, renalfailure, respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, hypotonia and central nervous system depression, and oneinfant died of cardiogenic shock. 6Lopinavir\\ritonavir oral solution contains ethanol (42.4% w/v) and glycol (15.3% w/v), and the contributions of lopinavir, ritonavir, ethanol, and propylene glycolexposure to the observed toxicities are not clear. While a small study of trough lopinavir plasmaconcentrations in premature infants and a larger-population PK study in infants including neonates provideGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection H-2some preliminary PK data, they are insufficient to currently allow a recommendation for safe and effective ritonavir-boosted lopinavir dosing immediately following birth.7,8The Food and Drug Administration recommends against the use of lopinavir\\ritonavir oral solution in premature infants until 14 days after theirdue date, or in full-term infants younger than 42 weeks postmenstrual age. 6 While there is considerable interest in the use of integrase inhibitors in neonates, data are lacking toformulate a safe recommendation Neonatal washout elimination of raltegravir thatcrossed the placenta after maternal administration is highly variable, with a half-life ranging from 9.3 to 184hours over the first days of life. 9As raltegravir competes with bilirubin for protein binding and for elimination through glucuronidation, increased plasma raltegravir concentrations may lead to increasedplasma concentrations of free unconjugated bilirubin, posing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy andkernicterus, particularly in preterm infants who have decreased bilirubin elimination, decreased albuminbinding capacity and an immature blood-brain barrier. 10Use of the recently approved oral granule raltegravir formulation in neonates should be avoided until adequate neonatal PK and safety data are available. Current recommendations for ARV prophylaxis for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission in high-risk infants in the United States (e.g., limited prenatal maternal ARV therapy, high maternal viral load) are for useof zidovudine and nevirapine dosed according to the NICHD-HPTN 040 regimen. 11,12The nevirapine regimen used in NICHD-HPTN 040 was designed to maintain nevirapine concentrations above 0.1microgram /mL, the drug concentration target used in studies of prevention of HIV transmission, not the 3.0microgram /mL target used in treatment of HIV-infected individuals. 13In this study, both 2- and 3-drug combination regimens were superior to zidovudine prophylaxis alone to prevent intrapartum transmission;however, there was no incremental benefit of the 3-drug regimen (lamivudine and nelfinavir for 2 weeks pluszidovudine for 6 weeks) compared to the 2-drug regimen (3 doses of nevirapine in the first week of life plus6 weeks of zidovudine) in prevention of perinatal transmission. The three-drug regimen had significantlymore hematologic toxicity and the powder nelfinavir formulation is no longer commercially available. Despite these data, combination treatment of infants at high risk of HIV infection before diagnostic test results indicating infection are available has been increasing. The European Pregnancy and Paediatric HIVCohort Collaboration (EPPICC) has pooled data from 5,285 mother-infant pairs considered at high risk ofperinatal transmission (no antepartum maternal treatment or detectable maternal viremia despite treatment)included in eight European cohorts and evaluated the use of combination prophylaxis. Among the 1,105infants receiving combination a regimen including a protease inhibitor. In these observational cohorts, therewas no difference in infant infection rates between one drug and combination prophylactic regimens. 14As discussed above, the data necessary for safe and appropriate neonatal dosing of all components of a three-drug ARV regimen for treatment of HIV infection are not currently available. The risks associated with use of a three-drug ARV regimen in neonates as well as the potential benefits, including the possibility of prolonged remission in infected neonates, require further study before a generalrecommendation can be made. The Panel recommends that neonatal care providers, who are considering a 3-drug ARV treatment regimen of term infants younger than 2 weeks or premature infants, contact a pediatricHIV expert for guidance and individual case assessment of the risk/benefit ratio of treatment and for thelatest information on neonatal drug doses. Providers may contact a local pediatric HIV expert or the National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765), which provides free clinical consultation on perinatal HIV care. References 1.

They generally have had a long clinical course and extensive history of treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (cAR T).1Adolescents with non-perinatally acquired HIV infection generally follow a clinical course similar to that in adults; early intervention with cART should be considered for them.2 Dosing of Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-Infected Adolescents Puberty is a time of somatic growth and sexual maturation, with females developing more body fat and malesmore muscle mass. These physiologic changes may affect drug pharmacokinetics (PK), which is especially important for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are used in combination with protein-bound medicines or hepatic enzyme inducers or inhibitors. 3 In addition, many (e.g., abacavir, emtricitabine, administered to children at higher weight- or surface area-based doses than would be predicted by direct extrapolation of adult doses. This is based upon reported PK data indicating more rapid drug clearance in children. Data suggesting optimal doses for everyAR V drug in adolescents are not available although Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information includes a discussion of data relevant to adolescents for individual drugs and notes the age listed on the druglabel for adult dosing. Adolescent Contraception, Pregnancy, and Antiretroviral Therapy HIV-infected adolescents may be sexually active and usually initiate activity during or after puberty.Reproductive health options including preconception care, contraception methods, and safer sex techniques forprevention of secondary HIV transmission should be discussed with them regularly (see U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use ).4For additional information please see the Perinatal GuidelinesPanel's Recommendations Combination antiretroviral therapy regimens must be individually tailored to the adolescent (AIII). Reproductive options including preconception care, contraception methods, and safer sex techniques for prevention of secondary HIV transmission to sexual partners should be discussed regularly (AI). Adolescents who are considering a planned pregnancy should be receiving a maximally suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy regimen (AII). Providers should be aware of potential interactions between combination antiretroviral therapy and hormonal contraceptives that could lower contraceptive efficacy (AII*) . Pediatric and adolescent care providers should prepare adolescents for the transition into adult care settings (AIII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-2section entitled\u2014 Reproductive Options for HIV-Concordant and Serodiscordant Couples .5 The possibility of planned and unplanned pregnancy should also be considered when selecting a cART regimen for an adolescent female. The most vulnerable period in fetal organogenesis is the first trimester, often before pregnancy is recognized. Concerns about specific ARV drugs and birth defects should be promptly addressed topreclude any misinterpretation or lack of adherence by HIV -infected pregnant adolescents (for additional information please see the Perinatal Guidelines ).5Currently efavirenz is the only approved ARV drug that carries Food and Drug Administration Pregnancy Class D labeling, based on neural tube defects in primates.However , a recent updated meta-analysis found no increased risk of teratogenicity associated with first- trimester efavirenz exposure. This review contributed to the evidence base for the revised 2013 World HealthOrganization (WHO) guidelines on ARV therapy; WHO recommends including efavirenz as part of first-linetherapy in adults regardless of gender, and indicates that it can be used throughout pregnancy, including duringthe first trimester. However, because of the low incidence of central nervous system anomalies in the overallpopulation and relatively small number of exposures in the current literature, continued surveillance of birthoutcomes is warranted. 6Although increasing data on the use of efavirenz in pregnancy are reassuring, many experts remain reluctant to consider use of efavirenz in adolescent females who are trying to conceive or whoare not using effective birth control. Readers should consult the Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States for guidance in selection of ARV drugs during pregnancy. Contraceptive-Antiretroviral Drug Interactions Several PI and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs alter metabolism of oral contraceptives,resulting in possible decreases in ethinyl estradiol or increases in estradiol or norethindrone levels (see theAdult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org ).7-9These changes may decrease the effectiveness of the oral contraceptives or potentially increase the risk of estrogen- orprogestin-related adverse effects. Some newer agents, such as integrase inhibitors (specifically raltegravir),appear to have no interaction with estrogen-based contraceptives. 10Providers should be aware of these drug interactions and consider alternative or additional contraceptive methods for patients receiving cART. For moreinformation about potential interactions between ARVs and hormonal contraceptives please see Table 3 in the Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States located at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/3/perinatal-guidelines/152/overview . Whether interactions with cART would compromise the contraceptive effectiveness of progestin-onlyinjectable contraceptives (such as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA]) is unknown because thesemethods produce higher blood hormone levels than other progestogen-only oral contraceptives and combinedoral contraceptives. In one study, the efficacy of DMPA was not altered in women receiving concomitantnelfinavir-, efavirenz-, or nevirapine-based treatment, with no evidence of ovulation during concomitantadministration for 3 months, no additional adverse effects, and no clinically significant changes in ARV druglevels. 11,12At this time, concerns about loss of bone mineral density (BMD) with long-term use of DMPA with or without cART (specifically tenofovir)13should not preclude use of DMPA as an effective contraceptive, unless there is clinical evidence of bone fragility. However, more active monitoring of BMD in young womenon DMPA may need to be considered. 13Minimal information exists about drug interactions with use of newer methods of hormonal contraception (e.g., the patch and vaginal ring).14HIV-infected women can use all available contraceptive methods, including the transdermal patch and vaginal ring.4Adolescents who want to become pregnant should be referred for preconception counseling and care, including discussion of specialconsiderations for use of cART during pregnancy (see the Perinatal Guidelines ).5 HIV-Infected Pregnant Adolescents and Outcomes Pregnancy should not preclude the use of optimal therapeutic regimens. However, because of considerationsrelated to prevention of perinatal transmission and maternal and fetal safety, timing of initiation of treatmentGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-3and selection of regimens may be different for pregnant women than for nonpregnant women. Details regarding choice of cART regimen in pregnant HIV-infected women, including adolescents, are provided in the Perinatal Guidelines .5Although information is limited about the pregnancies of adolescents who were HIV-infected perinatally, perinatal HIV transmission outcomes in this population appear similar to those in adult cohorts;15-18 however, there may be differences in pregnancy-related morbidities. Kenny et al19reported pregnancy outcomes from the United Kingdom and Ireland in a group of 30 adolescents who were perinatally HIV- infected or who acquired HIV infection at a young age. Few of these pregnancies were planned and in many cases, the partner was unaware of the mother 's HIV status. Rates of elective termination, miscarriage, and prematurity were high. The rate of prematurity was twice that in the general adolescent population of Europe.Many of the women had an AIDS diagnosis before pregnancy, but only one infant was HIV-infected. Althoughthe rate of perinatal transmission is reassuring, this study highlights some of the major challenges in caring forpregnant, perinatally HIV-infected youth. Comparisons of pregnancy incidence and outcomes between perinatally infected and non-perinatally infected youth are few and may offer special insight into the effects of prolonged HIV infection on pregnancy-relatedsequelae. Agwu et al 20retrospectively evaluated pregnancies at four clinics. Non-perinatally infected youth were more likely to have one or more pregnancies despite similar age at first pregnancy between groups. Theyalso appeared to have more premature births and spontaneous abortions, but that is tempered by the fact thatthe perinatally infected youth were more likely to have an elective termination. The perinatal transmission ratefor the entire cohort was 1.5%. Similar results were found in several other studies. 21,22However, in a single- center review of perinatal versus non-perinatal birth outcomes, infants born to women who were perinatallyinfected with HIV were more likely to be small for gestational age. 23Recently Badell and colleagues noted that 20 perinatally infected pregnant women were significantly more likely to be younger, have a detectable viralload, and have HIV-genotypic resistance compared to 80 non-perinatally infected pregnant women. The mediangestational age at delivery and rates of obstetrical and neonatal complications were similar between the groups.There was one case of perinatal transmission in an infant born to a perinatally infected mother versus twotransmission events in offspring of the mothers who were not perinatally infected. 24 Transition of Adolescents into Adult HIV Care Settings Facilitating a smooth transition of adolescents with chronic health conditions from their pediatric/adolescentmedical home to adult care can be difficult and is especially challenging for those who are HIV-infected.Transition is described as \"a multifaceted, active process that attends to the medical, psychosocial, andeducational or vocational needs of adolescents as they move from the child-focused to the adult-focused health-care system.\" 25Care models for children and adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV tend to be family-centered, consisting of a multidisciplinary team that often includes pediatric or adolescent physicians,nurses, social workers, and mental health professionals. These providers generally have long-standingrelationships with patients and their families, and care is rendered in discreet, more intimate settings. Althoughexpert care is also provided under the adult HIV care medical model, an adolescent may be unfamiliar with themore individual-centered, busier clinics typical of adult medical providers and uncomfortable with providerswith whom they, in many cases, do not have a long-standing relationship. Providing an adolescent and an adultmedical care provider with support and guidance regarding expectations for each partner in the patient-providerrelationship may be helpful. In this situation, it may also be helpful for a pediatric and an adult provider toshare joint care of a patient for a period of time. Providers should also have a candid discussion with atransitioning adolescent to understand what qualities the adolescent considers most important in an adult caresetting (e.g., confidentiality, small clinic size, after-school appointments). Pediatric and adolescent providersshould have a formal plan in place to transition adolescents to adult care. Some general guidelines abouttransitional plans and who might benefit most from them are available. 26-32 Outcomes are variable in young adult patients transitioned to adult care. Definitions of \"successful transition\"have ranged from the ability to maintain a certain level of follow-up in the new clinic, to laboratory measuresof stability, to comparisons of younger and older adult patients. 33Factors that should be taken intoGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection I-4consideration during transition include social determinants such as developmental status, behavioral/mental health issues, housing, family support, employment, recent discharge from foster care, peer pressure, illicit drug use, and incarceration. Psychiatric comorbidities and their ef fective management predict adherence to medical care and therapy.34-36Currently there is no definitive model of transition to adult HIV care and only limited reports about outcomes following transition. One such article from the United Kingdom suggests ahigher mortality risk after transition. 36 References 1. Van Dyke RB, Patel K, Siberry GK, et al.

More recent studies from adult populations suggest that therelationship between ARV adherence and viral suppression may vary with individual drug, drug class, andpattern of adherence. 5Viral suppression may be achieved with lower levels of adherence to boosted PI and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor regimens.5,6In patients who achieve virologic suppression, the degree of adherence needed to prevent viral rebound appears to decrease over time.7Different patterns of inadequate adherence (e.g., intermittent missed doses, treatment interruptions) may have a differential impacton regimen efficacy, depending on the drug combination. 8,9 Poor adherence will result in sub-therapeutic plasma ARV drug concentrations, facilitating development ofdrug resistance to one or more drugs in a given regimen, and possibly cross-resistance to other drugs in thesame class. Multiple factors (including regimen potency, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, viral fitness,and the genetic barrier to ARV resistance) influence the adherence-resistance relationship. 10In addition to compromising the efficacy of the current regimen, suboptimal adherence has implications for limiting futureeffective drug regimens in patients who develop multidrug-resistant HIV and for increasing the risk ofsecondary transmission. Poor adherence to ARVs is commonly encountered in the treatment of HIV-infected children and adolescents. Multiple studies have reported that fewer than 50% of children and/or caretakers reported fulladherence to prescribed regimens. Rates of adherence varied with method of ascertainment (e.g., parent/childreport, pharmacy records), ARV regimens, and study characteristics. 2,3,11,12A variety of factors\u2014including medication formulation, frequency of dosing, child's age, and psychosocial and behavioral characteristics ofPanel's Recommendations Strategies to maximize adherence should be discussed before initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy and again before changing regimens (AIII). Adherence to therapy must be assessed and promoted at each visit, along with continued exploration of strategies to maintain and/or improve adherence (AIII). At least one method of measuring adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy should be used in addition to monitoring viral load (AII). When feasible, a once-daily antiretroviral regimen should be considered (BI*) . To improve and support adherence, providers should maintain a nonjudgmental attitude, establish trust with patients/caregivers, and identify mutually acceptable goals for care (AII*) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-2children and parents\u2014have been associated with adherence; however, no consistent predictors of either good or poor adherence in children have been consistently identified.13-15Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that adherence is not static and can vary with time on treatment.16These findings illustrate the difficulty of maintaining high levels of adherence and underscore the need to work in partnership withfamilies to ensure that adherence education, support, and assessment are integral components of care. Specific Adherence Issues in Children Adherence is a complex health behavior that is influenced by the regimen, patient and family factors, andcharacteristics of health care providers. 14The limited availability of palatable formulations for young children is especially problematic.4Furthermore, infants and children are dependent on others for administration of medication; thus, assessment of the capacity for adherence to a complex, multidrugregimen requires evaluation of the caregivers and their environments, as well as the ability and willingness ofa child to take the drug. Barriers faced by adult caregivers that can contribute to non-adherence in childreninclude forgetting doses, changes in routine, being too busy, and child refusal. 17,18Some caregivers may place too much responsibility for managing medications on older children before they are developmentally able toundertake such tasks, 19whereas others themselves face health and adherence challenges related to HIV infection, substance use, or other medical conditions. Other barriers to adherence include caregivers'unwillingness to disclose HIV infection status to the child and/or others, reluctance of caregivers to fillprescriptions locally, hiding or relabeling of medications to maintain secrecy within the household,avoidance of social support, and a tendency for doses to be missed if the parent is unavailable. Adherencemay also be jeopardized by social issues within a family (e.g., substance abuse, unstable housing, andinvolvement with the criminal justice system). Specific Adherence Issues in Adolescents HIV-infected adolescents also face specific adherence challenges. Several studies have identified both pillburden and lifestyle issues (i.e., not having medications on hand when away from home, change in schedule)as significant barriers to effective adherence. 20Denial and fear of their HIV infection are common in adolescents, especially youth who have been recently diagnosed; this may lead to refusal to initiate orcontinue cART. Distrust of health care workers, misinformation about HIV , and lack of knowledge about theavailability and effectiveness of ARV treatments can also be barriers to linking adolescents to care, retainingthem in care, and maintaining them on successful cART. Perinatally infected youth are familiar with the challenges of taking complex drug regimens and with the routine of chronic medical care; nevertheless, they often have long histories of inadequate adherence.Regimen fatigue also has been identified as a barrier to adherence in adolescents. 21HIV-infected adolescents often have low self-esteem, unstructured and chaotic lifestyles, concomitant mental illnesses, and copepoorly with their illness. Depression, alcohol or substance abuse, poor school attendance, psychiatricdisorders and advanced HIV disease have been associated with non-adherence. 22A review of published papers on adherence among HIV-infected youth suggests that depression and anxiety are consistentlyassociated with poorer adherence. 22Adherence to complex regimens is particularly challenging at a time of life when adolescents do not want to be different from their peers. Further difficulties include adolescentswho live with parents or partners to whom they have not yet disclosed their HIV status and youth who arehomeless and have no place to store medicine. When recommending treatment regimens for adolescents,clinicians must balance the goal of prescribing a maximally potent ARV regimen with a realistic assessmentof existing and potential support systems to facilitate adherence. Adherence Assessment and Monitoring The process of adherence preparation and assessment should begin before therapy is initiated or changed. Aroutine adherence assessment should be incorporated into every clinic visit. A comprehensive assessmentshould be instituted for all children in whom cART initiation or change is considered. Evaluations shouldGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-3include nursing, social, and behavioral assessments of factors that may influence adherence by children and their families and can be used to identify individual needs for intervention. Specific, open-ended questionsshould be used to elicit information about past experience as well as concerns and expectations abouttreatment. When assessing readiness and preparing to begin treatment, it is important to obtain a patient'sexplicit agreement with the treatment plan, including strategies to support adherence. It is also important toalert patients to minor adverse effects of ARVs, such as nausea, headaches, and abdominal discomfort thatmay recede over time or respond to change in diet or timing of medication administration. Adherence is difficult to assess accurately; different methods of assessment have yielded different results and each approach has limitations.12,23,24Patients, caregivers, and health care providers often overestimate adherence although infected youth and caregivers report similar rates of adherence.25Use of multiple methods to assess adherence is recommended.24,26Viral load monitoring is useful in identifying patients who require enhanced adherence support.27The viral load response to a new regimen is often the most accurate indication of adherence if the virus is susceptible to the regimen and the medication doses are appropriate. Other measuresinclude quantitative self report of missed doses by caregivers and children or adolescents (i.e., focusing onmissed doses during a recent 3-day or 1-week period), descriptions of the medication regimens, and reports ofbarriers to administration of medications. Caregivers may report number of doses taken more accurately thandoses missed. 28Targeted questions about stress, pill burden, and daily routine are recommended. Pharmacy refill checks and pill counts can identify adherence problems not evident from self-reports.29Electronic monitoring devices (e.g., Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS] caps) which are equipped with acomputer chip that records each opening of a medication bottle are primarily used in research studies, but havebeen shown to be useful tools to measure adherence in some settings. Mobile phone technologies (e.g.,interactive voice response, SMS text messaging) are being evaluated to quantify missed doses and provide real-time feedback on adherence to caregivers, but studies in the pediatric population are in the pilot phase. 30,31 Home visits can play an important role in assessing adherence. In some cases, suspected non-adherence isconfirmed only when dramatic clinical responses to cART occur during hospitalizations or in other supervisedsettings. Preliminary studies suggest that monitoring plasma ARV concentrations or therapeutic drugmonitoring may be useful measures in situations where non-adherence is suspected. Drug concentrations inhair are currently being studied as an alternative method to measure adherence. 32,33 Adherence can change over time. An adolescent who was able to strictly adhere to treatment upon initiationof a regimen may not be able to maintain complete adherence over time. A nonjudgmental attitude andtrusting relationship foster open communication and facilitate assessment. To obtain information onadherence in older children, it is often helpful to ask both HIV-infected children and their caregivers aboutmissed doses and problems. Their reports may differ significantly; therefore, clinical judgment is required tobest interpret adherence information obtained from the multiple sources. 34 Strategies to Improve and Support Adherence Intensive follow-up is required, particularly during the first few months after therapy is initiated. This isparticularly important if treatment must be started urgently. If there are particular concerns about adherence,patients should be seen and/or contacted by phone (voice mail and text messaging) or email frequently\u2014asoften as weekly during the first month of treatment\u2014to assess adherence and determine the need forstrategies to improve and support adherence. Strategies include the development of patient-focused treatment plans to accommodate specific patient needs, integration of medication administration into the daily routines of life (e.g., associating medicationadministration with daily activities such as brushing teeth), and use of social and community supportservices. Multifaceted approaches that include regimen-related strategies; educational, behavioral, andsupportive strategies focused on children and families; and strategies that focus on health care providers\u2014rather than one specific intervention\u2014may be most effective. 19,35,36Programs designed for administration of directly observed combination therapy to adults, in either the clinic or at home, have demonstrated successfulresults in both the United States and in international, resource-poor settings. 37,38Modified directly observedGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-4therapy (m-DOT), where one dose is administered in a supervised setting and the remaining doses are self- administered, appears to be both feasible and acceptable.35,39However, a recent meta-analysis of 10 randomized clinical trials evaluating DOT to promote adherence in adults found that it was no more effectivethan self-administered treatment. 40In another meta-analysis of DOT studies, DOT was found to have a demonstrated effect on virologic, immunologic, and adherence outcomes, but efficacy of the strategy was notsupported when the analysis was restricted to randomized controlled trials. 41Table 12 summarizes some of the strategies that can be used to support and improve adherence to ARV medications. The Centers forDisease Control and Prevention offers a web-based toolkit (consisting of four evidence-based HIVmedication adherence strategies) to HIV care providers. 42 Regimen-Related Strategies ARV regimens for children often require the administration of large numbers of pills or unpalatable liquids, each with potential adverse effects and drug interactions, in multiple daily doses. To the extent possible,regimens should be simplified with respect to the number of pills or volume of liquid prescribed, as well as frequency of therapy, and chosen to minimize drug interactions and adverse effects. 43When non-adherence occurs, addressing medication-related issues (e.g., adverse effects) may result in improvement. If a regimen is overly complex, it can be simplified. For example, when the burden of pills is great, one or more drugs can be changed to a fixed-drug combination resulting in a regimen with fewer pills. A once-daily regimen should be considered, when feasible. Several studies in adults have demonstrated better adherence with once-daily versus twice-daily ARV regimens.44-46In a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials in adults, a lower pill burden was associated with better adherence and viral suppression. Adherence was modestly better with once-dailyregimens than with twice-daily regimens; however , rates of viral suppression did not differ.47Once-daily dosing may be less forgiving of poor adherence for some medications but outcomes are likely to vary byspecific drug regimen. When non-adherence is related to poor palatability of a liquid formulation or crushedpills and simultaneous administration of food is not contraindicated, the offending taste can sometimes bemasked with a small amount of flavoring syrup or food (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ) in order to overcome medication aversion.48Unfortunately, the taste of lopinavir/ritonavir cannot be masked with flavoring syrup. A small study of children aged 4 to 21 years found that training children toswallow pills has been associated with improved adherence at 6 months post-training. 49 Patient/Family-Related Strategies The primary approach taken by the clinical team to promote medication adherence in children is patient andcaregiver education. Educating families about adherence should begin before ARV medications are initiatedor changed and should include a discussion of the goals of therapy, the reasons for making adherence apriority, and the specific plans for supporting and maintaining a child's medication adherence. Caregiveradherence education strategies should include the provision of both information and adherence tools, such aswritten and visual materials; a daily schedule illustrating times and doses of medications; and demonstrationof the use of syringes, medication cups, and pillboxes. A number of behavioral tools can be used to integrate taking medications into an HIV-infected child's dailyroutine. The use of behavior modification techniques, especially the application of positive reinforcements andthe use of small incentives (including financial incentives) for taking medications, can be effective tools topromote adherence. 50Availability of mental health services and the treatment of mental health disorders (such as depression) may facilitate adherence to complex ARV regimens.51A gastrostomy tube should be considered for non-adherent children who are at risk of disease progression and who have severe and persistent aversion totaking medications. 52If adequate resources are available, home-nursing interventions may also be beneficial. Directly observed dosing of ARV medications has been implemented in adults, adolescents, and children, usinghome nursing services as well as daily medication administration in the clinic setting. Other strategies to support adherence that have been employed in the clinical setting include setting patients'cell phone alarms to go off at medication times; using beepers or pagers as an alarm; sending SMS text-message reminders; conducting motivational interviews; providing pill boxes and other adherence supportGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-5tools, particularly for patients with complex regimens; and delivering medications to the home. Randomized clinical trials in adults have demonstrated that text-messaging is associated with improved adherence.53-56In a pilot study evaluating peer support and pager messaging in an adult population, peer support wasassociated with greater self-reported adherence post-intervention; however, the effect was not sustained atfollow-up. Although pager messaging was not associated with reported adherence, improved biologicoutcomes were measured. 57Motivational interviews, including computer-based interventions, are currently being evaluated.50,58A study evaluating the efficacy of a 4-session, individual, clinic-based, motivational, interviewing intervention targeting multiple risk behaviors in HIV-infected youth demonstrated anassociation with lower viral load at 6 months in youth taking cART. However, reduction in viral load was notmaintained at 9 months. 59In adults, an intervention that taught managed problem solving resulted in improved adherence and viral suppression during 1 year of follow-up.60 Health Care Provider-Related Strategies Providers have the ability to improve adherence through their relationships with patients' families. Thisprocess begins early in a provider's relationship with a family, when the clinician obtains explicit agreementabout the medication and treatment plan and any further strategies to support adherence. Fostering a trustingrelationship and engaging in open communication are particularly important. 61Provider characteristics that have been associated with improved patient adherence in adults include consistency, giving information,asking questions, technical expertise, and commitment to follow-up. Creating an environment in the healthcare setting that is child-centered and includes caregivers in adherence support also has been shown toimprove treatment outcomes. 62 Table 12. Strategies to Improve Adherence to Antiretroviral Medications (page 1 of 2) Initial Intervention Strategies Establish trust and identify mutually acceptable goals for care. Obtain explicit agreement on the need for treatment and adherence. Identify depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse, or other mental health issues for the child/adolescent and/or caregiver that may decrease adherence. Treat mental health issues before starting ARV drugs, if possible. Identify family, friends, health team members, and others who can support adherence. Educate patient and family about the critical role of adherence in therapy outcome. Specify the adherence target: 95% of prescribed doses. Educate patient and family about the relationship between partial adherence and resistance. Educate patient and family about resistance and constraint in later choices of ARV drug (i.e., explain that although a failure of adherence may be temporary, the effects on treatment choice may be permanent). Develop a treatment plan that the patient and family understand and to which they feel committed. Establish readiness to take medication through practice sessions or other means. Consider a brief period of hospitalization at start of therapy in selected circumstances for patient education and to assess tolerability of medications chosen. Medication Strategies Choose the simplest regimen possible, reducing dosing frequency and number of pills. Choose a regimen with dosing requirements that best conform to the daily and weekly routines and variations in patient and family activities. Choose the most palatable medicine possible (pharmacists may be able to add syrups or flavoring agents to increase palatability). Choose drugs with the fewest adverse effects; provide anticipatory guidance for management of adverse effects. Simplify food requirements for medication administration. Prescribe drugs carefully to avoid adverse drug-drug interactions. Assess pill-swallowing capacity and offer pill-swallowing training.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection J-6References 1. Flynn PM, Rudy BJ, Douglas SD, et al.

This requires consideration of the toxicity potential of a cART regimen, as well as the individualchild's underlying conditions, concomitant medications, and prior history of drug intolerances or viralresistance. Adverse effects have been reported with use of all antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, and are among the most common reasons for switching or discontinuing therapy, and for medication nonadherence. However, rates of treatment-limiting adverse events in ARV-naive patients enrolled in randomized trials or large observational cohorts appear to be declining with increased availability of better-tolerated and less toxic cART regimens and are generally less than 10%.1-12In general, the overall benefits of cART outweigh its risks, and the risk of some abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., anemia, renal impairment) may be lower with cART than in its absence. ARV drug-related adverse events can vary in severity from mild to severe and life-threatening. Drug-relatedtoxicity can be acute (occurring soon after a drug has been administered), subacute (occurring within 1 to 2days of administration), or late (occurring after prolonged drug administration). For some ARV medications,pharmacogenetic markers associated with risk of early toxicity have been identified, but the only such screenin routine clinical use is HLA B*5701 as a marker for abacavir hypersensitivity. 13For selected children aged <3 years who require treatment with efavirenz, an additional pharmacogentic marker, CYP2B6 genotype,should be assessed (see Efavirenz in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ).14For a few other ARV drugs, known therapeutic ranges for plasma concentrations as determined by therapeutic drugmonitoring (TDM) may indicate the need for dose reduction or modification of cART in patientsexperiencing adverse effects (see below and Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Pediatric HIV Infection ).Panel's Recommendations In children who have severe or life-threatening toxicity, all antiretroviral drugs should be stopped immediately (AIII). Once symptoms of toxicity have resolved, antiretroviral therapy should be resumed with substitution of a different antiretroviral drug or drugs for the offending agent(s) (AII*) . When modifying therapy because of toxicity or intolerance to a specific drug in children with virologic suppression, changing one drug in a multidrug regimen is permissible; if possible, an agent with a different toxicity and side-effect profile should bechosen (AI*) . The toxicity and the medication presumed responsible should be documented in the medical record and the caregiver and patient advised of the drug-related toxicity (AIII). Dose reduction is not a recommended option for management of ARV toxicity, except for those few antiretroviral drugs for which a therapeutic range of plasma concentrations detected by therapeutic drug monitoring correlates with toxicity (AII*) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-2The most common acute and chronic adverse effects associated with ARV drugs or drug classes are presented in the Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance tables. The tables include information on common causative drugs, estimated frequency of occurrence, timing of symptoms, risk factors, potential preventivemeasures, and suggested clinical management strategies and provide selected references regarding thesetoxicities in pediatric patients. Management Management of medication-related toxicity should take into account its severity, the relative need for viralsuppression, and the available ARV options. In general, mild and moderate toxicities do not requirediscontinuation of therapy or drug substitution. However, even mild adverse effects may have a negativeimpact on medication adherence and should be discussed before therapy is initiated, at regular providervisits, and at onset of any adverse effects. Common, self-limited adverse effects should be anticipated, andreassurance provided that many adverse effects will resolve after the first few weeks of cART. For example,when initiating therapy with boosted protease inhibitors (PIs), many patients experience gastrointestinaladverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Instructing patients to take PIs withfood may help minimize these side effects. Some patients may require antiemetics and antidiarrheal agentsfor symptom management. Central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects are commonly encountered wheninitiating therapy with efavirenz. Symptoms can include dizziness, drowsiness, vivid dreams, or insomnia.Patients should be instructed to take efavirenz-containing regimens at bedtime, on an empty stomach, to helpminimize these adverse effects. They should be advised that these adverse effects usually diminish in generalwithin 2 to 4 weeks of initiating therapy in most people, but may persist for months in some, and may requirea medication change. 15-17In addition, mild rash can be ameliorated with drugs such as antihistamines. For some moderate toxicities, using a drug in the same class as the one causing toxicity but with a differenttoxicity profile may be sufficient and discontinuation of all therapy may not be required. In patients who experience an unacceptable adverse effect from cART, every attempt should be made to identify the offending agent and replace the drug with another effective agent as soon as possible. 1,18Many experts will stagger a planned interruption of a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-basedregimen, stopping the NNRTI first and the dual nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase backbone 7 to 14days later because of the long half-life of NNRTI drugs. For patients who have a severe or life-threateningtoxicity, however, all components of the drug regimen should be stopped simultaneously, regardless of drughalf-life. Once the offending drug or alternative cause for the adverse event has been determined, planningcan begin for resumption of therapy with a new ARV regimen that does not contain the offending drug orwith the original regimen, if the event is attributable to another cause. All drugs in the ARV regimen shouldthen be started simultaneously, rather than one at a time with observation for adverse effects. When therapy is changed because of toxicity or intolerance in a patient with virologic suppression, agents with different toxicity and side-effect profiles should be chosen, when possible. 19-23Clinicians should have comprehensive knowledge of the toxicity profile of each agent before selecting a new regimen. In the eventof drug intolerance, changing a single drug in a multidrug regimen is permissible for patients whose viralloads are undetectable. However, substitution of a single active agent for a single drug in a failing multidrugregimen (e.g., a patient with virologic failure) is generally not recommended because of concern fordevelopment of resistance (see Recognizing and Managing Antiretroviral Treatment Failure in Management of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy ). TDM may be used in the management of the child with mild or moderate toxicity if the toxicity is thought tobe the result of a drug concentration exceeding the normal therapeutic range 24,25(see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring ). This is the only setting in which dose reduction would be considered appropriate management of drug toxicity, and even then, it should be used with caution; an expert in the management ofpediatric HIV infection should be consulted.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-3To summarize, management strategies for drug intolerance include: Symptomatic treatment of mild-to-moderate transient side effects. If necessary, change from one drug to another drug to which a patient's virus is sensitive (such as changing to abacavir for zidovudine-related anemia or to nevirapine for efavirenz-related CNS symptoms). Change drug class, if necessary (such as from a PI to a NNRTI or vice versa) and if a patient's virus is sensitive to a drug in that class. Dose reduction only when drug levels are determined excessive. References 1. Elzi L, Marzolini C, Furrer H, et al.

Children (Aged 2 Years) Without Lipid Abnormalities or Additional Risk Factors: Obtain non-fasting screening lipid profiles before initiating or changing therapy and then, if levelsare stable, every 6-12 months. If TG or LDL-C is elevated, obtain fastingblood tests. Children with LipidAbnormalities and/or Additional Risk Factors: Obtain 12-hour FLP before initiating or changing therapy and every 6 months thereafter (more often if indicated).Assessment of additional CVDrisk factors should be done inall patients. HIV-infected patients are considered to be at moderate risk of CVD. b Counsel lifestyle modification,dietary interventions (e.g., low- fat diet, low simple carbohydrate diet in case ofTG, exercise, smoking cessation) for adequate trial period (3-6 months). If receiving d4T, it should be discontinued. If receiving PI-based ART, consider switching to a new PI-sparing ART regimen or PI-based regimencontaining boosted ATV or DRV, which are less likely to cause lipid abnormalities. Consider lipid-lowering therapy in consultation with a lipidspecialist if 6-month trial of lifestyle modification fails. Some experts suggest treatment in children receiving ARV drugs at cut pointsrecommended by NHLBI cardiovascular risk reduction guidelines for children aged10 years: LDL-C 190 mg/dL, regardless 160 mg/dL orLDL-C 130 mg/dL based on presence of additional risk factors and risk conditions. bGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-11Adverse EffectsAssociated ARVsOnset/Clinical ManifestationsEstimated 12-hour FLP , LFTs, and CK at 4 and 8 weeks, and 3 months after starting lipid therapy.

Fibrates (gemfibrozil and fenofibrate) and N-3 PUFAs derived from fish oils may be used as alternative agents foradults with TG but are not approved for use in children. The long-term risks of lipidabnormalities in children receiving cART are unclear. However, persistentdyslipidemia in children may lead to premature CVD.Table 13b.

NRTIs (especially ZDV, d4T) are associated with lactic acidosis andhepatic steatosis.Onset : Hepatitis generally occurs within first few months of therapy, but can occur later. Steatosis presents after months to years oftherapy. HBV-coinfected patients may develop severehepatic flare with theinitiation, withdrawal, ordevelopment of resistance to 3TC, FTC, or TDF (especially inpatients receiving only one anti-HBV agent). Hepatitis may also represent IRIS early in therapy, especially inHBV- and HCV-infected patients.

If hepatic enzymes are elevated >5 to 10 times ULN or chronic liverdisease, most clinicians would avoid NVP . Monitoring : For ARVs Other Than NVP: Obtain AST and ALT at baseline and thereafter at least every 3-4 months,or more frequently in at- risk patients (e.g., HBV- or HCV-coinfected orelevated baseline AST and ALT). For NVP: Obtain AST and ALT at baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, then every 3months.Asymptomatic patients with elevated ALT or AST should be evaluated forother causes and monitored closely. If ALT or AST is more than 5-10times ULN, some would consider discontinuing ARVs. In symptomatic patients, discontinue all ARVs andother potential hepatotoxic agents and avoid restarting the offending agent. If a symptomatic hepatic event occurs on NVP ,permanently discontinue drug (see also NVP Hypersensitivity). When clinical hepatitis is associated with lacticacidosis, avoid restarting the most likely agent, including ZDV, d4T, and ddIin particular (see also causes of hepatitis: HAV, HBV, HCV,EBV, and CMV.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection K-21Table 13e.

Antiretroviral Therapy-Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations\u2014Insulin Resistance, Asymptomatic Hyperglycemia, Diabetes Mellitus (Last updated March 5, 2015; last reviewed March 5, 2015) Adverse Effects Associated ARVsOnset/Clinical ManifestationsEstimated Frequency ATV, ATV/r, DRV/r, NFV, TPV/r)Onset : Weeks to months after beginning therapy; median of 60 days (adult data). Presentation : Most Commonly: Asymptomatic fasting hyperglycemia (possibly in the setting of lipodystrophy),metabolic syndrome, or growth delay Also Possible: Frank DM (i.e., polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, ARV-Treated 100 person- years (2- to 4-fold greater than that for HIV- uninfected adults) ARV-Treated Children: Rare in HIV-infected childrenRisk Factors For Type 2 DM : Lipodystrophy Metabolic syndrome Family history of DM High BMI ObesityPrevention : Lifestyle modification Although uncertain, avoiding the use of d4T may reduce risk. Monitoring : Monitor for polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia,change in body habitus, and acanthosisnigricans. Obtain RPG Levels at: Initiation of ARV therapy 3-6 months after therapy initiation Once a year thereafter For RPG 140 mg/dL: Obtain FPG performed after 8-hour fast and consider referral toendocrinologist.Counsel on lifestyle modification (i.e., low-fat diet, exercise, no smoking). Change NRTI (e.g., from d4T, ZDV, or ddI to TDF or ABC). For Either RPG 200 mg/dL Plus Symptoms of DM or FPG 126 mg/dL : Patient meets diagnostic criteria for DM; endocrinologist. 100-125 aInsulin resistance, asymptomatic hyperglycemia, and DM form a spectrum of increasing severity. Insulin resistance is often defined as elevated insulin levels for the level of glucose observed; impaired FPG as an FPG of 100-125 mg/dL; impaired glucose tolerance as an elevated 2-hour PG of 140-199 mg/dL in a standard OGTT; and diabetes mellitus as either an FPG 126 mg/dL, a random PG 200 mg/dL in a patient with hyperglycemia symptoms, an HgbA1C of 6.5%, or a 2-hour PG after OGTT 200 mg/dL. However, the Panel does not recommend routine determinations of insulin levels, HgbA1C, or glucose tolerance without consultation with an endocrinologist; these guidelines are instead based on the readilyavailable random and fasting plasma glucose levels.

For patients taking TDF, some panelistsadd serum phosphate to the list of routine labs to monitor. In the presence of persistent proteinuria or glucosuria, or for symptoms of bone pain ormuscle pain or weakness, also monitor serum phosphate. Because toxicity risk increases with duration ofTDF treatment, frequency of monitoring should not decrease with time. Whileunproven, routine monitoring intervals of every 3-6 months might be considered.Abnormal values should be confirmed by repeat testing, and frequency of monitoringcan be increased if abnormalities are found and TDF is continued.If TDF is the likely cause,consider using alternativeARV.

Management of children who have persistent mild or moderate rash after the lead-in period should be individualized and consultation with an expert in HIV care should be obtained.

Changes in the antiretroviral (ARV) regimen and otheraspects of the management of treatment-experienced children can be organized into the following categories: 1. Modifying ARV regimens in children on effective cART for simplification or improved adverse effect profile; 2. Recognizing and managing ARV drug toxicity or intolerance (see Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance ); 3. Recognizing and managing treatment failure; and 4. Considerations about interruptions in therapy. Modifying Antiretroviral Regimens in Children with Sustained Virologic Suppression on Antiretroviral Therapy Initial ARV regimens are chosen based on safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy data for drugs available in formulations suitable for the age of the child at initiation of cART. New ARV options may become availableas children grow and learn to swallow pills and as new drugs, drug formulations, and data become available.For children who have sustained virologic suppression (e.g., 6-12 months) on their current regimen,changing to a new ARV regimen may be considered in order to permit use of pills instead of liquids, reducepill burden, allow use of once-daily medications, reduce risk of adverse effects, and align their regimens withwidely used, efficacious adult regimens. Several studies have addressed switching ARV regimen components in children with sustained virologic suppression. Based on the NEVEREST study, young children (aged <3 years) with virologic suppression whoswitch from lopinavir/ritonavir to nevirapine can maintain virologic suppression as well as those who continue lopinavir/ritonavir, provided there is good adherence and no baseline resistance to nevirapine. 1,2In the NEVEREST 3 study, young children with history of exposure to nevirapine and with virologic suppression on lopinavir/ritonavir maintained virologic suppression when switched from lopinavir/ritonavir to efavirenz.3By extrapolation, replacement of lopinavir/ritonavir with raltegravir, or another integrase inhibitor (INSTI) would likely be effective, but this has not beendirectly studied. Several small studies have demonstrated sustained virologic suppression and reassuring safety outcomes when drugs that have greater long-term toxicity risk are replaced with drugs that are thought to have less toxicity risk (e.g., replacing stavudine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, zidovudine, or abacavir; For children who have sustained virologic suppression on their current regimen, changing to a new antiretroviral regimen can be considered in order to facilitate adherence, decrease drug-associated toxicities, or improve safety (BII). It is critical to consider past episodes of antiretroviral treatment failure, tolerability, and all prior drug resistance testing results to avoid choosing new ARV drugs for which archived drug resistance would limit activity.

When considering such a change, it is important to ensure that a child does not have virologic treatment failure. It is also critical to consider past episodes of ARV treatment failure, tolerability, and all priordrug resistance testing results in order to avoid choosing new ARV drugs for which archived drug resistance would limit activity. The evidence supporting many of these ARV changes is indirect, extrapolated from dataabout drug performance in initial therapy or follow-on therapy after treatment failure. When such changes are made, careful monitoring is important to ensure that virologic suppression is maintained.

Boston, MA.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-4Recognizing and Managing Antiretroviral Treatment Failure (Last updated March 5, 2015; last reviewed March 5, 2015) Definitions of Treatment Failure Treatment failure can be categorized as virologic failure, immunologic failure, or clinical failure (or some combination of the three). Laboratory results must be confirmed with repeat testing before a final assessmentof virologic or immunologic treatment failure is made. Almost all antiretroviral (ARV) managementdecisions for treatment failure are based on addressing virologic failure. Virologic Failure Virologic failure occurs as an incomplete initial response to therapy or as a viral rebound after virologic suppression is achieved. Virologic suppression is defined as having plasma viral load below the lower levelof quantification (LLQ) using the most not recommended. Virologic failure is defined for all children as a repeated plasma viral load >200 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy. Because infants with high plasma viral loads at initiation oftherapy occasionally take longer than 6 months to achieve virologic suppression, some experts continue thetreatment regimen for such infants if viral load is declining but is still >200 copies/mL at 6 months andmonitor closely for continued decline to virologic suppression soon thereafter. Among many of thosereceiving lopinavir/ritonavir, suppression can be achieved without regimen change if efforts are made toimprove adherence. 1However, ongoing non-suppression\u2014especially with non-nucleoside regimens\u2014increases the risk of drug resistance.2There is controversy regarding the clinical implications of HIV RNA levels between the LLQ and <200 copies/mL in patients onPanel's Recommendations The causes of virologic treatment failure\u2014which include poor adherence, drug resistance, poor absorption of medications, inadequate dosing, and drug-drug interactions\u2014should be assessed and addressed (AII). Perform antiretroviral (ARV) drug-resistance testing when virologic failure occurs, while the patient is still taking the failing regimen, and before changing to a new regimen (AI*) . The goal of therapy following treatment failure is to achieve and maintain virologic suppression, as measured by a plasma viral load below the limits of quantification using the most sensitive assay (AI*) . ARV regimens should be chosen based on treatment history and drug-resistance testing, including both past and current resistance test results (AI*) . The new regimen should include at least two, but preferably three, fully active ARV medications with assessment of anticipated ARV activity based on past treatment history and resistance test results (AII*) . When complete virologic suppression cannot be achieved, the goals of therapy are to preserve or restore immunologic function (as measured by CD4 T lymphocyte values), prevent clinical disease progression, and prevent development of additional drug resistance that could further limit future ARV options (AII). Children who require evaluation and management of treatment failure should be managed by or in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist (AI*) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-5combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). HIV-infected adults with detectable viral loads and a quantified result <200 copies/mL after 6 months of cART often ultimately achieve virologic suppression withoutregimen change. 3\"Blips,\" defined as isolated episodes of plasma viral load detectable at low levels (<500 copies/mL) followed by return to viral suppression, are common and not generally reflective of virologicfailure. 4-6Repeated or persistent plasma viral load detection above 200 copies/mL (especially if >500 copies/mL) after having achieved virologic suppression usually represents virologic failure.6-9 Immunologic Failure Immunologic failure is defined as a suboptimal immunologic response to therapy or an immunologic decline while on therapy. While there is no standardized definition, many experts would consider as suboptimalimmunologic response to therapy the failure to maintain or achieve a CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cellcount/percentage that is at least above the age-specific range for severe immunodeficiency. Evaluation ofimmune response in children is complicated by the normal age-related changes in CD4 cell count discussedpreviously (see Immunologic Monitoring in Children: General Considerations in Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring ). Thus, the normal decline in CD4 values with age needs to be considered when evaluating declines in CD4 parameters. CD4 percentage tends to vary less with age. At about age 5 years, absolute CD4cell count values in children approach those of adults; consequently, changes in absolute count can be used inchildren aged 5 years. Clinical Failure Clinical failure is defined as the occurrence of new opportunistic infections (OIs) and/or other clinical evidence of HIV disease progression during therapy. Clinical failure represents the most urgent andconcerning type of treatment failure and should prompt an immediate evaluation. Clinical findings should beviewed in the context of virologic and immunologic response to therapy; in patients with stable virologic andimmunologic parameters, development of clinical symptoms may not represent treatment failure. Clinicalevents occurring in the first several months after cART initiation often do not represent cART failure. Forexample, the development or worsening of an OI in a patient who recently initiated cART may reflect adegree of persistent immune dysfunction in the context of early recovery or, conversely, be a result ofimmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, clinical failure may occur many monthsafter CD4 cell counts have normalized. 10The occurrence of significant clinical disease progression should prompt strong consideration that the current treatment regimen is failing. Discordance Between Virologic, Immunologic, and Clinical Responses In general, cART that results in virologic suppression also leads to immune restoration or preservation aswell as to prevention of HIV-related illnesses. The converse is also generally true: Ineffective cART that failsto suppress viremia is commonly accompanied by immunologic and clinical failure. 11However, patients may also present with discordant responses, with failure in one domain (e.g., immunologic failure) but with agood response in the other domains (e.g., virologic and clinical response). It is essential to consider potentialalternative causes of discordant responses before concluding that cART failure has truly occurred. Poor Immunologic Response Despite Virologic Suppression Poor immunologic response despite virologic suppression is uncommon in children. 10For patients with baseline severe immunosuppression, virologic suppression may be achieved much sooner than immune recovery. During this early treatment period of persistent immunosuppression, additional clinical diseaseprogression can occur. The first considerations in cases of poor immunologic response despite virologic suppression are to exclude laboratory error in CD4 or viral load measurements and to ensure that CD4 values have been interpretedcorrectly in relation to the natural decline in CD4 cell count over the first 5 to 6 years of life. Anotherlaboratory consideration is that some viral load assays may not amplify all HIV groups and subtypes (such asGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-6HIV-1 non-M groups or HIV-2), resulting in falsely low or negative viral load results (see Diagnosis of HIV Infection and Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring ). Once laboratory results are confirmed, evaluation for adverse drug effects, medical conditions, and other factors that can result in lower CD4 values is necessary (see Table 15). Patients who have very low baseline CD4 values before initiating cART are at higher risk of an impaired CD4 response to cART and, based on adult studies, may be at higher risk of death and AIDS-definingillnesses, despite virologic suppression. 12-16In a study of 933 children aged 5 years who received cART that resulted in virologic suppression, 92 (9.9%) had CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm3at cART initiation and 348 (37%) had CD4 cell counts <500 cells/mm3. After 1 year of virologic suppression, only 7 (1% of the cohort) failed to reach a CD4 cell count of at least 200 cells/mm3and 86% had CD4 cell counts >500 cells/mm3. AIDS-defining events were uncommon overall (1%) but occurred in children who did and did not achieveimproved CD4 cell counts. 10 Certain ARV agents or combinations may be associated with a blunted CD4 response. For example,treatment with a regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) and didanosine can blunt theCD4 response, especially if the didanosine dose is not reduced, 17and this combination is not recommended as part of initial therapy. Dosing of didanosine should be reduced when co-administered with tenofovir. Inadults, ARV regimens containing zidovudine may also impair rise in CD4 cell count but not CD4 percentage,perhaps through the of zidovudine. 18Fortunately, this ARV drug-related suboptimal CD4 cell count response to therapy does not seem to confer an increased risk of clinical events. It is not clearwhether this scenario warrants substitution of zidovudine with another drug. Several drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents) and other conditions (e.g., hepatitis C, tuberculosis, malnutrition, Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, syphilis) are independently associated with lowCD4 values. Poor Clinical Response Despite Adequate Virologic and Immunologic Responses Clinicians must carefully evaluate patients who experience clinical disease progression despite favorable immunologic and virologic responses to cART. Not all cases represent cART failure. One of the mostimportant reasons for new or recurrent opportunistic conditions despite achieving virologic suppression andimmunologic restoration/preservation within the first months of cART is IRIS, which does not representcART failure and does not generally require discontinuation of cART. 19,20Children who have suffered irreversible damage to their lungs, brain, or other organs\u2014especially during prolonged and profoundpretreatment immunosuppression\u2014may continue to have recurrent infections or symptoms in the damagedorgans because the immunologic improvement may not reverse damage to the organs. 21Such cases do not represent cART failure and, in these instances, children would not benefit from a change in ARV regimen.Before a definitive conclusion of cART clinical failure is reached, a child should also be evaluated to rule out(and, if indicated, treat) other causes or conditions that can occur with or without HIV-relatedimmunosuppression, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, malnutrition, and malignancy. Occasionally, however,children will develop new HIV-related opportunistic conditions (e.g., Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia or esophageal candidiasis occurring more than 6 months after achieving markedly improved CD4 values andvirologic suppression) not explained by IRIS, pre-existing organ damage, or another reason. 10Although such cases are rare, they may represent cART clinical failure and suggest that improvement in CD4 values maynot necessarily represent normalization of immunologic function. In children who have signs of new orprogressive abnormal neurodevelopment, some experts change the ARV regimen, aiming to include agentsthat are known to achieve higher concentrations in the central nervous system; however, the data supportingthe strategy are mixed. 22-26Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-7Management of Virologic Treatment Failure Since almost all ARV management decisions for treatment failure are based on addressing virologic failure, this section on managing treatment failure will address only virologic treatment failure (repeated plasma viralload >200 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy). The approach to management and subsequent treatment of virologic treatment failure may differ depending on the etiology of the problem. Although the cause of virologic treatment failure may be multifactorial, it isgenerally the result of non-adherence. Assessment of a child with suspicion of virologic treatment failureshould include evaluation of adherence to therapy, medication intolerance, pharmacokinetic (PK)explanations of low drug levels or elevated, potentially toxic levels, and evaluation of suspected drugresistance (see Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing ). The main barrier to long-term maintenance of sustained virologic suppression in adults and children is incomplete adherence to medication regimens, withsubsequent emergence of viral mutations conferring partial or complete resistance to one or more of thecomponents of the ARV regimen. Table 16 outlines a comprehensive approach to evaluating causes of virologic treatment failure in children, with particular attention to adherence.

Obtain description of: WHO gives medications WHEN medications are taken/given WHAT medications are taken/given (names, doses) WHERE medications are kept/administered HOW medications make child feel Have open-ended discussion of experiences taking/giving medications and barriers/challenges. Identify or re-engage family members to support/supervise adherence. Establish fixed daily times and routines for medication administration. To avoid any patient/caregiver confusion with drug names, explain that drug therapies havegeneric names and trade names, and manyagents are co-formulated under a third or fourthname. Explore opportunities for facility or home-based DOT. 2. Review pharmacy records. Assess timeliness of refills. 3. Observe medication administration. Observe dosing/administration in clinic. Conduct home-based observation by visiting health professional. Admit to hospital for trial of therapy. Observe administration/tolerance. Monitor treatment response. Simplify medication regimen, if feasible. Substitute new agents if single ARV is poorly tolerated. Consider DOT. Use tools to simplify administration (e.g., pill boxes, reminders [including alarms], integrated medication packaging for a.m. or p.m. dosing). As a last resort, consider gastric tube placement to facilitate adherence. 4. Conduct psychosocial assessment. Make a comprehensive family-focused assessment of factors likely to impact adherence with particular attention to recentchanges in: Status of caregiver, housing, financial stability of household, child/caretakerrelationships, school, and child'sachievement level Substance abuse (child, caretaker, family members) Mental health and behavior Child/youth and caretaker beliefs about cART Disclosure status (to child and others) Peer pressure Address competing needs through appropriate social services. Address and treat concomitant mental illness and behavioral disorders. Initiate disclosure discussions with family/child. Consider need for child protective services and alternate care settings when necessary. Pharmacokinetics andDosing Issues1. Recalculate doses for individual medications using weight or body surface area. 2. Identify concomitant medications including prescription, over-the-counter, and recreationalsubstances; assess for drug-drug interactions. 3. Consider drug levels for specific ARV drugs (see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring ). Adjust drug doses. Discontinue or substitute competing medications. Reinforce applicable food restrictions.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-9Virologic Treatment Failure with No Viral Drug Resistance Identified Persistent viremia in the absence of detectable viral resistance to current medications is usually a result of non-adherence, but it is important to exclude other factors such as poor drug absorption, incorrect dosing,and drug interactions. If adequate drug exposure can be ensured, then adherence to the current regimenshould result in virologic suppression. Resistance testing should take place while a child is on therapy. Afterdiscontinuation of therapy, predominant plasma viral strains may quickly revert to wild-type and re-emergeas the predominant viral population, in which case resistance testing may fail to reveal drug-resistant virus(see Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing ). An approach to identifying resistance in this situation is to restart the prior medications while emphasizing adherence, and repeat resistance testing in 4 weeks if plasmavirus remains detectable. If the HIV plasma viral load becomes undetectable, non-adherence was likely theoriginal cause of virologic failure of boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens (in the absence of prior treatment with full-dose ritonavir) is frequently associated with no detectable major PI resistance mutations, and virologicsuppression may be achieved with continuation of the PI-based regimen accompanied by adherenceimprovement measures. 27,28 In some cases, the availability of a new regimen for which the convenience (e.g., single fixed-dose tabletonce daily) is anticipated to address the main barrier to adherence may make it reasonable to change to thisnew regimen with close adherence and viral load monitoring. In most cases, however, when there is evidenceof poor adherence to the current regimen and an assessment that good adherence to a new regimen isunlikely, emphasis and effort should be placed on improving adherence before initiating a new regimen (seeAdherence ). When efforts to improve adherence will require several weeks or months, many clinicians may choose to continue the current non-suppressive regimen (see Management Options When Two Fully Active Agents Cannot Be Identified or Administered ).29-31Treatment with non-suppressive regimens in such situations should be regarded as an acceptable but not ideal interim strategy to prevent immunologic andclinical deterioration while working on adherence. Such patients should be followed more closely than thosewith stable virologic status, and the potential to successfully initiate a fully suppressive ARV drug regimenshould be reassessed at every opportunity. Complete treatment interruption for a persistently non-adherentpatient should prevent accumulation of additional drug resistance but has been associated with immunologicdeclines and poor clinical outcomes. 32 Virologic Treatment Failure with Viral Drug Resistance Identified After reaching a decision that a change in therapy is needed, a clinician should attempt to identify at least two, but preferably three, fully active ARV agents from at least two different classes on the basis ofresistance test results, prior ARV exposure, acceptability to the patient, and likelihood of adherence. 33-37This often requires using agents from one or more drug classes that are new to the patient. Substitution or additionof a single drug to a failing regimen is not recommended because it is unlikely to lead to durable virologicsuppression and will likely result in additional drug resistance. A drug may be new to the patient but haveTable 16. Assessment of Causes of Virologic Antiretroviral Treatment Failure (page 2 of 2) Cause of Virologic Treatment FailureAssessment Method Intervention ARV Drug Resistance 1. Perform resistance testing, as appropriate (see Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing ). If no resistance to current drugs is detected, focus on improving adherence. If resistance to current regimen is detected, optimize adherence and evaluate potential for new regimen (see Management of Virologic Treatment Failure ). Key to Acronyms: ARV = antiretroviral; cART = combination antiretroviral therapy; DOT = directly observed therapyGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-10diminished antiviral potency because of the presence of drug-resistance mutations that confer cross- resistance within a drug class A change to a new regimen must include an extensive discussion of treatment adherence and potential toxicity with a patient in an age- and development-appropriate manner and with a patient's caregivers.Clinicians must recognize that conflicting requirements of some medications with respect to food andconcomitant medication restrictions may complicate administration of a regimen. Timing of medicationadministration is particularly important to ensure adequate ARV drug exposures throughout the day.Palatability, size and number of pills, and dosing frequency all need to be considered when choosing a newregimen. 38 Therapeutic Options After Virologic Treatment Failure with Goal of Complete Virologic Suppression Determination of a new regimen with the best chance for complete virologic suppression in children who have already experienced treatment failure should be made by or in collaboration with a pediatric HIVspecialist. ARV regimens should be chosen based on treatment history and drug-resistance testing to optimize ARV drug potency in the new regimen. A general strategy for regimen change is shown in Table 17 , although as additional agents are licensed and studied for use in children, newer strategies that are better tailored to theneeds of each patient may be constructed. If a child has received initial therapy with an NNRTI-based regimen, a change to a PI-based regimen or integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimen is generally effective. Resistance to the NNRTInevirapine results in cross-resistance to the NNRTI efavirenz, and vice versa. However, the NNRTI etravirinecan retain activity against nevirapine- or efavirenz-resistant virus in the absence of certain key NNRTImutations (see below), but etravirine has generally been tested only in regimens that also contain a boostedPI. If a child received initial therapy with a PI-based regimen, a change to an NNRTI-based regimen or anINSTI-based regimen is generally effective. Lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimens have also been shown tohave durable ARV activity in some PI-experienced children. 39-41 The availability of new drugs in existing classes (e.g., the NNRTI etravirine) and other classes of drugs (e.g., INSTI) increases the likelihood of finding three active drugs, even for children with extensive drug resistance(see Table 17 ). Etravirine in combination with darunavir/ritonavir has been shown to be a safe and effective option for children for whom first-line cART fails.42,43Etravirine is approved for use in children aged 6 years and darunavir in children aged 3 years. Raltegravir, an INSTI, is approved for children aged 4 weeks.44 Dolutegravir is approved for use in adolescents aged 12 years. Use of newer agents in novel combinations is becoming more common in aging perinatally infected youth in the United States.45It is important to review individual drug profiles for information about drug interactions and dose adjustment when devising a regimenfor children with multi-class drug resistance. Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information provides more detailed information on drug formulation, pediatric and adult dosing, and toxicity, as well as discussion ofavailable pediatric data for the approved ARV drugs. Previously prescribed drugs that were discontinued because of poor tolerance or poor adherence maysometimes be reintroduced if ARV resistance did not develop and if prior difficulties with tolerance andadherence can be overcome (e.g., by switching from a liquid to a pill formulation or to a new formulation[e.g., ritonavir tablet]). Limited data in adults suggest that continuation of lamivudine can contribute tosuppression of HIV replication despite the presence of lamivudine resistance mutations and can maintainlamivudine mutations (184V) that can partially reverse the effect of other mutations conferring resistance tozidovudine, stavudine, and tenofovir. 46-48The use of new drugs that have been evaluated in adults but have not been fully evaluated in children may be justified, and ideally would be done in the framework of aclinical trial. Expanded access programs or clinical trials may be available (see www.clinicaltrials.gov ). New drugs should be used in combination with at least one, and ideally two, additional active agents.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-11Enfuvirtide has been Food and Drug Administration-approved for treatment-experienced children aged 6 years but must be administered by subcutaneous injection twice daily.49,50PK studies of certain dual- boosted PI regimens (lopinavir/ritonavir with saquinavir) suggest that PK targets for both PIs can beachieved or exceeded when used in combination in children. 51-53Multidrug regimens (up to 3 PIs and/or 2 NNRTIs) have shown efficacy in a pediatric case series, but they are complex, often poorly tolerated, andsubject to unfavorable drug-drug interactions. 54Availability of newer PIs (e.g., darunavir) and new classes of ARV drugs (integrase and CCR5 inhibitors) have lessened the need for use of enfuvirtide, dual-PI regimens,and regimens of four or reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-sparing regimens in adults with virologic failure and multidrug resistance have demonstrated no clear benefit of including NRTIs in the new regimen, 55,56and one of these studies reported higher mortality in those adults randomized to a regimen with NRTIs comparedto adults randomized to an NRTI-sparing regimen. 56There are no studies of NRTI-sparing regimens in children with virologic failure and multidrug resistance, but that may be a reasonable option for children withextensive NRTI resistance. When searching for at least two fully active agents in cases of extensive drug resistance, clinicians should consider the potential availability and future use of newer therapeutic agents that may not be studied orapproved in children or may be in clinical development. Information concerning potential clinical trials canbe found at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/clinical_trials and through collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist. Children should be enrolled in clinical trials of new drugs whenever possible. Pediatric dosing for off-label use of ARV drugs is problematic because absorption, hepatic metabolism, and excretion change with age.57In clinical trials of several ARV agents, direct extrapolation of a pediatric dose from an adult dose, based on a child's body weight or body surface area, was shown to result in anunderestimation of the appropriate pediatric dose. 58 Use of ARV agents that do not have a pediatric indication (i.e., off-label) may be necessary for HIV-infectedchildren with limited ARV options. In this circumstance, consultation with a pediatric HIV specialist foradvice about potential regimens, assistance with access to unpublished data from clinical trials or otherlimited off-label pediatric use, and referral to suitable clinical trials is recommended. Management Options When Two Fully Active Agents Cannot Be Identified or Administered It may be impossible to provide an effective and sustainable therapeutic regimen because no combination of currently available agents is active against extensively drug-resistant virus in a patient or because a patient isunable to adhere to or tolerate cART. The decision to continue a non-suppressive regimen must be made on an individual basis, weighing potential benefits and costs. Specifically, HIV providers must balance the inherent tension between the benefits ofvirologic suppression and the risks of continued viral replication and potential evolution of viral drugresistance in the setting of inadequate ARV drug exposure (i.e., non-adherence, non-suppressive suboptimalregimen). Non-suppressive regimens could decrease viral fitness and thus slow clinical and immunologicdeterioration while a patient is either working on adherence or awaiting access to new agents that areexpected to achieve sustained virologic suppression. 59However, persistent viremia in the context of ARV pressure has the potential to generate additional resistance mutations that could further compromise agents inthe same class that might otherwise have been active in subsequent regimens (e.g., continuing first-generation INSTIs or NNRTIs). Patients continuing non-suppressive regimens should be followed moreclosely than those with stable virologic status, and the potential to successfully initiate a fully suppressivecART regimen should be reassessed at every opportunity. The use of NRTI-only holding regimens or complete interruption of therapy is not recommended. In a trial (IMPAACT P1094) randomizing children harboring the M184V resistance mutation with persistent non-Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-12adherence and virologic failure to continue their non-suppressive non-NNRTI-based cART regimen versus switching to a lamivudine (or emtricitabine) monotherapy holding regimen, children who switched tomonotherapy experienced a 30% decline in absolute CD4 cell count (the primary outcome) over a 28-weekperiod. The median age of the participants was 15 years and the median entry CD4 cell count was 472cells/mm 3, and the median number of interventions that had been used to address non-adherence was four. Only patients in the lamivudine/emtricitabine arm experienced the primary outcome.60Although this was a small study (N = 33), it is the only study ever to randomize patients to continuing non-suppressive cARTversus lamivudine/emtricitabine monotherapy, and it is unlikely that it will be repeated. Thus, NRTI-onlyholding regimens are not recommended as a treatment strategy for children failing non-suppressive cART. Complete treatment interruption has also been associated with immunologic declines and poor clinical outcomes and is not recommended. 32See Treatment Interruption . References 1.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection L-17Considerations About Interruptions in Antiretroviral Therapy (Last updated March 5, 2015, last reviewed March 5, 2015) Unplanned Interruptions Temporary discontinuation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may be indicated in some situations, including serious treatment-related toxicity, acute illnesses or planned surgeries that preclude oralintake, lack of available medication, or patient or parent request. Observational studies of children and youthwith unplanned or non-prescribed treatment interruptions suggest that interruptions are common, mostpatients will experience immunologic decline during the treatment interruption, and most restart therapy. 1-3 The case of an infant who initiated cART soon after birth and had a prolonged period without viremia afterunplanned interruption is discussed in the Special Considerations for Neonates section. Structured Treatment Interruptions Planned periods during which antiretroviral therapy is not given, also known as \"structured treatmentinterruptions,\" were historically considered as a potential strategy to reduce toxicity, costs, and drug-relatedfailure associated with cART. Adult trials have demonstrated significantly higher morbidity and mortality in those randomized to structured treatment interruptions compared with continuous cART. 4Current Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for adults recommend against planned long-term structured treatment interruptions inadults (see the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ). In children, there have been fewer studies of long-term structured treatment interruption. In one study,children with controlled viral load (HIV RNA <400 copies/mL for >12 months) were subjected to increasingintervals of treatment interruption. Of 14 children studied, 4 maintained undetectable viral loads withinterruptions of up to 27 days. It has been hypothesized that enhanced HIV-specific immune responses mayplay a role in the viral suppression. 5However, new drug-resistance mutations were detected in 3 of 14 children in the structured treatment interruption study. In a European trial (PENTA 11), 109 children withvirologic suppression on cART were randomized to continuous therapy (CT) versus treatment interruptionwith (CD4)-guided re-initiation of cART. 6On average, CD4 values decreased sharply in the first 10 weeks after structured treatment interruption. However, most children in the structured treatmentinterruption arm (almost 60%) did not reach CD4 criteria to restart therapy over 48 weeks. Children in thestructured treatment interruption arm spent significantly less time on cART than children in the CT arm.None of the children in the trial experienced serious clinical illnesses or events, and the appearance of newdrug-resistance mutations did not differ between the two arms. In a recent analysis, every month of treatmentinterruption among children in the ARROW trial was associated with 2% (1% to 3%, P= 0.001) lower CD4 percentage by 3 years of follow up; having any interruption of treatment was associated with a trend to Outside the context of clinical trials, structured interruptions of combination antiretroviral therapy are not recommended for children (AIII).

One trial was designed to answer whether infants who initiated cART early could safely discontinue therapyat some point and reinitiate treatment based on CD4 cell decline. The CHER study in South Africa assessedoutcomes in infants randomized to deferred cART (initiation driven by CDC stage and CD4 status),immediate cART with interruption after 40 weeks, or immediate cART with interruption after 96 weeks. 8,9 While the 2 arms of interrupted therapy led to better outcomes compared to the deferred arms, up to 80% ofinfants had to restart therapy by the end of follow-up. The long-term outcomes in children after thisinterruption remain unknown and it is unclear if the short period of time on cART saved by most childrenmerits the potential risks associated with cessation. Given the increased availability of medications with less toxicity, the potential benefits of long-term structured treatment interruption may be decreasing. Current data do not support use of long-term structuredtreatment interruption in clinical care of HIV-infected children; additional studies of structured treatmentinterruption in specific situations for some children may be warranted.

Available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24209829 .Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection M-1Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Pediatric HIV Infection (Last updated March 5, 2015; last reviewed March 5, 2015) The goal of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs is to optimize treatment responses and tolerability, and to minimize drug-associated toxicity. A number of adult studies suggest thatmodified doses and regimen choices based on TDM result in achievement of targeted ARV drugconcentrations and are associated with improved clinical response and/or tolerability. 1-7In children, the usefulness of TDM to guide dosing of ARV drugs has been demonstrated in a number of non-randomizedclinical trials and case reports. 8-19 Dosing of ARV drugs in HIV-infected children and adolescents depends on chronological age and/or bodyparameters (e.g., height, weight). Ongoing growth requires continuous reassessment of dosing of ARV drugsin order to avoid low drug exposure and development of viral resistance and virologic failure. Developmentaldifferences in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination contribute to high variability and agreater frequency of suboptimal exposure to multiple therapeutic agents including ARVs in children andadolescents compared to adults. 20-22Suboptimal exposure to selected ARV agents with recommended dosing has been demonstrated in pediatric patients, especially in young children.14,15,23-25 Because of the diverse developmental challenges in palatability and acceptability of combinationantiretroviral therapy (cART), children and adolescents are frequently faced with the use of altered dosingregimens and ARV combinations for which safety and efficacy have not been established in large clinicaltrials. Furthermore, dosing recommendations for ARV drugs at the time of licensing for pediatric use arefrequently derived from a limited number of patients and pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and may berevised as newer PK data become available. 14,15,24The Health and Human Services (HHS) Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children (the Panel) recommendsconsidering TDM for certain ARV agents when the newly approved pediatric formulation and/or dosing areused based on limited PK and efficacy data in small populations (see specific drug information sections). Evaluation of plasma concentrations of antiretroviral drugs is not required in the management of most pediatric patients with HIV, but should be considered in children on combination antiretroviral therapy in the following scenarios (BII): Use of antiretroviral drugs with limited pharmacokinetic data and therapeutic experience in children (e.g., for use of efavirenz in children aged <3 years and darunavir with once-daily dosing in children aged interactions and food-drug interactions; Unexpected suboptimal treatment response (e.g., lack of virologic suppression with history of medical adherence); Suspected suboptimal absorption of the drug; or Suspected dose-dependent toxicity. Evaluation of the enzyme cytochrome P450 combination with the evaluation of plasma efavirenz concentrations is recommended for children aged <3 years receiving efavirenz because the dosing recommendation depends on the result, given the significant association between this polymorphism and efavirenzconcentrations (AII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsPanel's RecommendationsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection M-2TDM can also be considered in management of treatment failure for children on cART to increase efficacy and to decrease toxicity. Use of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring to Improve Efficacy The relationship between ARV drug concentrations and ARV efficacy must be clearly defined for TDM to be useful.26-29This association has been shown to be the strongest for protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) as well as for maraviroc.19,30-32For of their triphosphate metabolites have been shown to be most important in determining therapeutic response. Obtaining intracellular NRTI metabolite concentrations is expensive, labor-intensive, requires large blood volumes, and is limited to research settings. Limited data have demonstrated that serum concentrations of NR TIs are also correlated with virologic suppression; however, no efficacy plasma concentrations have been derived for NRTIs.33,34 Based on data from adult studies, consensus target efficacy plasma trough concentrations for treatment-naiveand treatment-experienced patients have been developed by clinical pharmacology experts from the UnitedStates and Europe for the many PIs and NNRTIs, as well as the CCR5 receptor antagonist maraviroc Several of nelfinavir, efavirenz, nevirapine) have been validated inpediatric studies. Efficacy trough concentrations for maraviroc and tipranavir have been derived in patientswith multiple drug-resistant HIV strains only. Although exposure-response data for PI darunavir, theNNRTI etravirine, and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir are accumulating, they have been consideredinsufficient to define target efficacy concentrations at this time. 35-38Table 18 includes data on the plasma trough concentrations derived from clinical trials of these drugs.

Available plasma trough concentration in treatment-experienced patients with resistant HIV-1 strain only eDarunavir dose 600 mg twice daily fMedian (range)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection M-3The suggested efficacy plasma trough concentrations are generally applicable when the patient's resistance testing demonstrates susceptibility to the particular ARV drug. In treatment-experienced patients with virologic failure, a higher plasma trough concentration may be required to suppress viral replication when there is decreased susceptibility to the ARV drug.9,39-41Recent PK/pharmacodynamic modeling of lopinavir/ritonavir in children suggests that higher plasma exposure might be beneficial not only for treatment-experienced, but also for treatment-naive children, with the tar get plasma trough concentration of 2,400 ng/mL corresponding to C95 proposed as a target for increased efficacy.42For the majority of PIs, viral resistance develops cumulatively with successive mutations, and higher drug exposure can potentially overcome lower levels of resistance. The concept of inhibitory quotient (IQ) has been developed and successfully applied to certain PIs.43IQ is expressed as the ratio of patient plasma trough concentration (Cmin) to specific viral susceptibility parameters (e.g., fold change in inhibitory concentration or the number of drug-specific resistance-associatedmutations). 1,39This approach does not apply to drugs with low, single mutation thresholds for resistance (e.g., the NNRTIs nevirapine and efavirenz) because it is not possible to overcome such resistance by increasing theARV drug exposure. Suboptimal plasma concentrations of efavirenz and nevirapine have been linked tovirologic failure in children. 8,24,44Evaluation of efavirenz plasma concentrations in combination with pharmacogenetic evaluation for the polymorphism of the main drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P (CYP)450 CYP2B6 is recommended if efavirenz is used in children aged <3 years to avoid suboptimal drug exposure(see Efavirenz in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). Use of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring to Decrease Toxicity The exposure-toxicity response relationship has been well defined for the PIs indinavir and atazanavir and theNNRTI efavirenz. 28,45Increased plasma concentrations of atazanavir have been linked to elevated bilirubin concentrations in adolescents, and measurement of the atazanavir plasma concentrations has been suggested formanagement of the atazanavir-associated hyperbilirubinemia in adolescents. 45 Adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects (e.g., CNS depression, dizziness, insomnia, hallucinations)associated with efavirenz have been shown to correlate with efavirenz plasma trough concentrations >4 mcg/mL in adult and pediatric studies. 8,46,47TDM-guided reduction in the efavirenz dose has been shown to successfully reduce neuropsychiatric side effects while allowing for continued virologic suppression inprospective adult studies. 48,49Recent reports on the PK of efavirenz in children aged <3 years demonstrated a significant relationship between high plasma efavirenz median concentrations and area under the curve versustime concentration (AUC) and drug-associated hematologic and CNS toxicity. 10,50Evaluation of the efavirenz plasma concentrations in combination with determination of polymorphism of the main drug-metabolizingenzyme CYP2B6 should be considered for preventing and decreasing efavirenz-associated adverse events inchildren aged <3 years and might be considered in older children (see next section on pharmacogenetics). Pharmacogenetic Evaluation as Part of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring The pharmacogenetics of HIV therapy investigate the interactions between human genetic polymorphisms andPK and the outcome of cART. Multiple metabolizing and drug transporter genes have been studied for theirassociation with efficacy and toxicity of ARV drugs. The most clinically significant relationship isdemonstrated by the association between the CYP2B6 G to T polymorphism and the PK, to efavirenz. CYP2B6 and G516T have been associated with elevated plasmaefavirenz concentrations and CNS toxicity in children and adults, while CYP2B6 G516G genotype has beenlinked to low plasma concentrations of efavirenz, decreased rates of virologic suppression and development ofresistance. 10,47,51,52Reducing the efavirenz dose in patients with the CYP2B6 T516T genotype has been shown to reverse or decrease drug-associated toxicity in adults and adolescents and to achieve therapeutic efavirenzconcentrations. 9,49,53,54 The effect of CYP2B6 G516T polymorphism on the PK of efavirenz appears to be most pronounced in youngerchildren undergoing maturation of the CYP450 enzymatic system. 10,21,50In the PACTG P1070 study, efavirenz dosing of approximately 40 mg/kg in children aged <3 years produced therapeutic efavirenz plasmaGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection M-4concentrations in 68% of children with GG/GT 516 rapid CYP2B6 genotypes, while the same dose led to significantly higher exposure with treatment-related toxicities greater than grade 3 in children with TT 516CYP2B6 genotype.10In this ongoing study, genotyping for CYP2B6 G516T polymorphism is incorporated in the pretreatment evaluation and will be used to determine the dosing regimen. While efavirenz is not recommended for initial therapy in children aged <3 years, should efavirenz use be considered in children aged<3 years, the Panel recommends obtaining CYP2B6 genotype as part of pretreatment evaluation and dose selection (see Efavirenz in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). For children aged >3 years with a known CYP2B6 poor metabolizer genotype, reduction of the recommended efavirenz dose may be considered. This dose reduction may prevent the risk or decrease the grade of CNS toxicity; however, it may also increase pill burden, particularly among adolescents who are using efavirenz-based fixed-dosecombinations. If this approach is taken, subsequent TDM is recommended to ensure that the patient achieves recommended plasma trough therapeutic efavirenz concentrations.49,55 Practical Considerations The use of TDM in clinical practice poses multiple challenges, including availability of the ARV drug assays and certified laboratories; difficulties in collecting timed blood samples in children to obtain true plasma trough concentrations; prolonged time to obtain the results; limited availability of pharmacologic pediatric expertise; and cost and reimbursement considerations. More extended PK evaluation of the AUC in children involves higher volumes of blood samples, cost, and time commitment. Limited information on safety and effectiveness of doseadjustment strategies in children and adolescents may also limit the application of TDM in clinical practice. When obtaining plasma concentrations in pediatric and adolescent patients, several important steps need to betaken. The accurate interpretation of TDM requires documentation of the following elements: Accurate information about the dose and formulation List of concomitant medications Food intake with the dose Timing of the dose and blood sample collection Adherence and resistance information Additional practical suggestions on TDM of ARV drugs can be found in a position paper by the Adult AIDSClinical Trials Group Pharmacology Committee 26and several pediatric review manuscripts.13,56Most importantly, consultation with an expert in pediatric HIV pharmacology is required to obtain guidance on whento obtain samples for TDM, how to interpret the PK data, and how to evaluate the need for dose adjustment andrepeat PK evaluation and follow up.

The goal of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is to suppress HIV replication as rapidlyand fully as possible, as indicated by a reduction in plasma HIV RNA to below the limit of detection usingthe most sensitive assays available. Unfortunately, mutations in HIV RNA arise during viral replicationbecause HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) is a highly error-prone enzyme. Consequently, ongoing replication inthe presence of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, as occurs in suboptimal adherence, readily and progressivelyselects for strains of HIV with mutations that confer drug resistance. Viruses harboring resistance-associatedmutations can be transmitted in both perinatal and non-perinatal infection, underscoring the importance ofresistance testing at the time of HIV diagnosis before cART initiation. 1,2 Drug-resistance detection methods vary depending on the class of ARV agents. Both genotypic assays andphenotypic assays currently are used to detect the presence of virus that is resistant to inhibitors of the HIVRT, integrase (IN), or protease (PR) enzymes. Clinical experience with testing for viral resistance to otheragents is more limited, but genotypic assays that assess mutations in gp41 (envelope) genes also arecommercially available. Experience is also limited with the use of commercially available genotypic andphenotypic assays in the evaluation of drug resistance in patients infected with non-B subtypes of HIV . 3,4 Table 19 summarizes the indications for using available resistance testing.Panel's Recommendations Antiretroviral drug-resistance testing is recommended at the time of HIV diagnosis, before initiation of therapy, in all treatment- naive patients (AII). Genotypic resistance testing is preferred for this purpose (AIII). Antiretroviral drug resistance testing is recommended before changing therapy because of virologic failure (AI*) . Resistance testing in patients with virological failure should be done while they are still on the failing regimen or within 4 weeks of discontinuation (AII*) . Phenotypic resistance testing should be used (usually in addition to genotypic resistance testing) for patients with known or suspected complex drug resistance mutation patterns, which generally arise after virologic failure of successive antiretroviral therapy regimens (BIII). The absence of detectable resistance to a drug does not ensure that use of the drug will be successful as mutations may not be detected once the drug has been discontinued. A history of all previously used antiretroviral agents and available resistance testresults must be reviewed when making decisions regarding the choice of new agents (AII). Viral coreceptor (tropism) assays should be used whenever the use of CCR5 antagonist is being considered (AI*) . Tropism assays should also be considered for patients who demonstrate virologic failure while receiving therapy that contains a CCR5antagonist (AI*) . Consultation with a pediatric HIV specialist is recommended for interpretation of resistance assays when considering starting or changing an antiretroviral regimen in pediatric patients (AI*) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanyingdata in children from one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents, but not studies limited to post-pubertal adolescentsGenotypic Assays Genotypic assays for resistance to RT and PR inhibitors and IN strand transfer inhibitors are based on polymerase chain reaction amplification and analysis of the RT, PR, and IN coding sequences present in HIVRNA extracted from plasma. Genotypic assays can detect resistance mutations in plasma samples containingapproximately 1,000 copies/mL or more of HIV RNA and results generally are available within 1 to 2 weeksof sample collection. 5Not all available genotypic tests include IN resistance; it may need to be specifically requested. Interpretation of test results requires knowledge of the mutations selected by different ARV drugsand of the potential for cross resistance to other drugs conferred by certain mutations. For some drugs, thegenetic barrier to the development of resistance is low and a single nucleotide mutation is enough to conferhigh-level resistance sufficient to remove any clinical utility of the drug. This is exemplified by resistance tonevirapine and efavirenz resulting from mutations in the HIV RT (e.g., K103N). Other mutations lead to drugresistance but simultaneously impair HIV replication. Clinically useful activity of the ARV agent maytherefore remain, as demonstrated by evidence of continued clinical benefit from lamivudine in individualswith evidence of the high-level lamivudine resistance engendered by the M184V RT mutation. 6By contrast, HIV evolution to high-level resistance to some drugs is associated with the emergence of mutations thatconfer resistance as well as compensatory mutations that allow the virus to replicate more efficiently in thepresence of the ARV agent. In addition, polymorphisms that occur naturally or in the presence of drug andare not significant alone may confer clinically significant drug resistance when present with otherpolymorphisms or major resistance mutations. 7 The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) and the Stanford University HIV Drug ResistanceDatabase maintain lists of resistance mutations that confer resistance to currently available ARV drugs (seehttp://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf or http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). A variety of online tools analyze the simultaneous effect of all mutations detected in a patient in order to assist theprovider in interpreting genotypic test results. Although the response to cART in children and adolescents isnot always predicted by the results of genotypic resistance assays, clinical trials in adults have demonstratedthe benefit of resistance testing combined with consultation with specialists in HIV drug resistance inimproving virologic outcomes. 5,8-14Given the potential complexity of interpretation of genotypic resistance, it is recommended that clinicians consult with a pediatric HIV specialist for assistance in the interpretation ofgenotypic results and design of an optimal new regimen. Phenotypic Assays Phenotypic resistance assays provide a more direct assessment of the impact on ARV susceptibility of viralreplication of mutations that are present in an individual's HIV variants. As they are most often performed,phenotypic assays involve PCR amplification of the predominant RT, IN, PR, or gp41 envelope genesequences from patient plasma and insertion of those amplified patient sequences into the backbone of acloned strain of HIV that expresses a reporter gene. Replication of this recombinant virus in the presence of arange of drug concentrations is monitored by quantifying expression of the reporter gene and is comparedwith replication of a reference drug susceptible HIV variant. The drug concentration that inhibits viralreplication by 50% (i.e., the mean inhibitory concentration [IC 50]) is calculated, and the ratio of the IC50of test and reference viruses is reported as the fold increase in IC50(i.e., fold resistance change). Automated, recombinant phenotypic assays that can produce results in 2 to 3 weeks are commercially available; however,they are more costly than genotypic assays. Analytic techniques have also been developed to use the genotype to predict the likelihood of a drug-resistant phenotype. This bioinformatic approach, currently applicable for RT, IN, and PR inhibitor resistance only,matches the pattern of mutations obtained from the patient sample with a large database of samples for whichboth genotype and phenotype are known. Therefore, the sample is assigned a predicted phenotypesusceptibility (or virtual phenotype) based on the data from specimens matching the patient's genotype. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection N-2Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection N-3Tropism (Viral Coreceptor Usage) Assays HIV enters cells by a complex, multistep process that involves sequential interactions between the HIV envelope protein molecules and the CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) receptor, and then with either the CCR5 orCXCR4 coreceptor molecules, culminating in the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Viruses initiallyare CCR5 tropic in the majority of untreated individuals, including infants and children perinatally infectedwith HIV . However, a shift in coreceptor tropism often occurs over time, from CCR5 usage to either CXCR4or dual or mixed [D/M] tropism. Viral coreceptor (tropism) or will or D/M tropism indicates resistance to CCR5 antagonists. ARV-treated patients with extensive drug resistance are more likely to harbor detectable CXCR4- or D/M-tropicvirus than untreated patients with comparable CD4 counts. 15-17Studies of heavily treated perinatally infected children and adolescents have shown CXCR4 tropism rates of 19% to 80%; however, most of the studieshave used genotypic testing to determine tropism, which may be flawed, as discussed below. Resistance to CCR5 antagonists is detected using specialized phenotypic Trofile TM[Monogram Biosciences, Inc.]). involve the generation of recombinant viruses bearing patient-derived envelope proteins (gp120 and gp41). The relative capacity of these pseudoviruses toinfect cells bearing the cell surface proteins CCR5 or CXCR4 is based on the expression of a reporter gene. Detection of X4 or D/M tropism is a contraindication to the use of the CCR5 antagonists as part of a therapeutic regimen. Coreceptor assays must be performed before a CCR5 inhibitor is used and should beconsidered in patients exhibiting virologic failure on a CCR5 inhibitor such as maraviroc. The Trofile TMassay takes about 2 weeks to perform and requires a plasma viral load 1000 copies/mL and at least 3 mL of plasma. The initial version of the TrofileTMassay used during the clinical trials that led to the licensure of maraviroc was able to detect X4-tropic virus with 100% sensitivity when present at a frequency of 10% of the plasma virus population, but only 83% sensitivity when the variant was present at a frequencyof 5%. In initial clinical trials of CCR5 antagonist drugs, this sensitivity threshold was not always sufficientto exclude the presence of clinically meaningful levels of X4- or D/M-tropic virus in patients initiating aCCR5 inhibitor-based regimen. The current enhanced sensitivity version of the Trofile TMassay (Trofile- ESTM) is able to detect X4- or D/M-tropic virus representing as little as 0.3% of the plasma virus.18,19 One of the tropism assays can also be performed following amplification of HIV sequences from peripheral bloodDNA (Trofile-DNA TM[Monogram Biosciences, Inc.]) and may be most useful when a change to a regimen containing a CCR5 antagonist is being considered for individuals with plasma viral load below 1,000 copies/mLand can be used even when the viral load is undetectable (e.g., if single-drug substitution for toxicity). Limitations of Current Resistance and Tropism Assays Limitations of the genotypic, phenotypic, and phenotype-prediction assay approaches include lack ofuniform quality assurance testing and high cost. In addition, drug-resistant variants are likely to exist at lowlevels in every HIV-infected patient. Drug-resistant viruses that constitute <10% to 20% of the circulatingvirus population or are present in the reservoir of latently infected cells may not be detected by any of thecurrently available commercial resistance assays. 20A comprehensive review of the past use of ARV agents and the virologic responses to those agents, and all prior resistance mutations (i.e., cumulative genotype),even if not present on the current genotype, is important in making decisions regarding the choice of newagents for patients with virologic failure. 21 The primary limitations of phenotypic assays are that their predictive power depends upon the sensitivity ofthe genotypic methods used and the number of matches to the patient's genotype. These tests also are morecostly than genotypic testing; therefore, their use should be reserved for clinical settings in which theinformation they provide will add benefit (see Table 19 ). Genotypic assays to assess tropism have been proposed as an alternative approach to detemining the tropismGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection N-4of plasma HIV . However, they are not currently recommended because the limited experience with this approach indicates that the sensitivity may be lower than phenotypic tropism assays, particularly in thesetting of CCR5 antagonist interruption where reversion to wild-type may occur. 22,23 Although drug resistance may be detected in the circulating plasma of infants, children, and adults who arenot receiving therapy at the time of the assay, loss of detectable resistance and reversion to predominantlywild-type virus often occur in the first 4 to 6 weeks after ARV drugs are stopped. 24-26As a result, resistance testing is of greatest value when performed prior to or within 4 weeks after drugs are discontinued, or as soonafter diagnosis as possible. 27The absence of detectable resistance to a drug at the time of testing does not ensure that future use of the drug will be successful,1,28especially if the agent shares cross resistance with drugs previously used. It may be prudent to repeat resistance testing if an incomplete virological response toa new treatment regimen is observed in an individual with prior treatment failure(s) (see Management of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy ). Use of Resistance Assays in Determining Initial Treatment Transmission of drug-resistant strains to newly infected individuals (via perinatal and non-perinataltransmission of HIV) has been well documented and is associated with suboptimal virologic response toinitial cART if this resistance is not taken into account when designing the initial regimen. 29-33Drug-resistant variants of HIV may persist for months after birth in infected infants34and impair the response to cART.35 Consequently, ARV drug-resistance testing is recommended for all treatment-naive children before therapy isinitiated. Standard genotypic testing is preferred in this setting because it may reveal the presence of both RTand PR resistance mutations and polymorphisms that facilitate the replication of drug-resistant virus.Genotypic testing for integrase resistance mutations prior to initial treatment is only recommended in specialcircumstances (e.g., acquisition of HIV from an individual treated with an integrase inhibitor with concernfor transmission of integrase resistance). Use of Resistance Assays in the Event of Virologic Failure Several studies in adults5,8-14have indicated that early virologic responses to salvage regimens were improved when results of resistance testing were available to guide changes in therapy, compared withresponses observed when changes in therapy were guided only by clinical judgment. Although not yetconfirmed in children, 36resistance testing appears to be a useful tool in selecting active drugs when changing ARV regimens in cases of virologic failure. Resistance testing also can help guide treatment decisions forpatients with suboptimal viral load reduction because virologic failure in the setting of cART may beassociated with resistance to only one component of the regimen. 3Poor adherence is the most common reason for virologic failure, regardless of whether resistance develops. It should always be suspected,confirmed, and addressed, especially when no evidence of resistance to a failing regimen is identified (seeManagement of Children Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy ). Standard genotype (RT, PR) Resistance testing indicated Resistance testing indicated Integrase phenotype/genotype Only if concern for acquisition of virus with resistance If failure on integrase inhibitor TrofileTM Only if considering CCR5 antagonist treatmentOnly if considering CCR5 antagonist forsubsequent regimen Phenotype (RT, PR) Not recommended prior to initial treatment unless genotypic evidence that multi-drug resistance wasacquiredIn the setting of extensive drug resistance,may assist in determining most active cARTregimen. Must be used in conjunction withcumulative genotypic resistance results andcART history and responseTable 19.

Clinicaltrials to define appropriate drug dosing and toxicity in children ranging in age from infancy to adolescenceare critical as new drugs become available. As additional ARV drugs become approved and optimal strategiesfor use of these drugs in children becomes better understood, the Panel will modify these guidelines. Theseguidelines are only a starting point for medical decision-making and are not meant to supersede the judgmentof clinicians experienced in the care of HIV-infected children. Because of the complexity of caring for HIV-infected children, and the decreasing number of children with perinatally acquired HIV in the United States,health care providers with limited experience in the care of these patients should consult with a pediatric HIVspecialist. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics jointly developed and published guidelines for the prevention and treatmentof opportunistic infections in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children; these guidelines are available athttp://aidsinfo.nih.gov .1Similar guidelines for adults are also available at the same website.2 References 1.

In clinically stable patients with undetectableviral load and stable CD4 T lymphocyte cell counts for more than 24 weeks, changing from twice-daily to once-daily dosing at 16 to20 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 600 mg oncedaily is recommended if part of a once-dailyregimen (see text below).Selected Adverse Events Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) can be fatal. HSRs usually occur during the first fewweeks of starting therapy. Symptoms mayinclude fever, rash, nausea, vomiting, malaiseor fatigue, loss of appetite, and respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough and shortness of breath). Several observational cohort studies suggest increased risk of myocardial infarction inadults with recent or current use of abacavir;however, other studies have not substantiatedthis finding, and there are no data in children. Special Instructions Test patients for the HLA-B*5701 allele before starting therapy to predict risk of HSR.Patients positive for the HLA-B*5701 alleleshould not be given abacavir. Patients with noprior HLA-B*5701 testing who are tolerating abacavir do not need to be tested. Warn patients and parents about risk of serious, potentially fatal HSR. Occurrence of HSRs requires immediate and permanent discontinuation of abacavir . Do not re- challenge. Abacavir can be given without regard to food. Oral solution does not require refrigeration.Abacavir (ABC, Ziagen) (Last updated June 29, 2015; last reviewed June 29, 2015) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Pediatric Oral Solution: 20 mg/mL (scored) Fixed-Dose Combination Tablets: With Lamivudine (3TC): ABC 600 mg 300 mg (Epzicom) With Zidovudine (ZDV) and 3TC: ABC 300 mg + ZDV 300 mg + 3TC 150 mg (Trizivir) With 3TC and Dolutegravir: ABC 600 mg + 3TC 300 mg + Dolutegravir 50 mg (Triumeq) Generic Formulations: ABC sulfate 300 mg tablets Fixed-dose combination tablets of ABC 300 mg + 3TC 150 mg + ZDV 300 mg Weight (kg)Twice-Daily Dosage Regimen AM Dose PM DoseOnce Daily Dose 14 to <20 kg\u00bd tablet (150 mg) \u00bd tablet (150 mg) 1 tablet (300 mg) 20 to <25 kg\u00bd tablet (150 mg) 1 tablet (300 mg) 1-1/2 tablets (450 mg) 25 kg 1 tablet (300 mg) 1 tablet (300 mg) 2 tablets (600 mg) OnceGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-3Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Abacavir does not inhibit, nor is it metabolized by, hepatic cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzymes. Therefore, it does not cause changes in clearance of agents metabolized through these pathways, such as protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (see more information in Drug Interaction section below under Pediatric Use). Through interference with alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyl transferase, alcohol increases abacavir levels by 41%. Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, diarrhea, rash, and anorexia. Less common (more severe): Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) observed in approximately 5% of adults and children (rate varies by race/ethnicity) receiving abacavir. HSR to abacavir is a multi-organ clinical syndrome usually characterized by rash or signs or symptoms in two or more of the following groups: Fever Constitutional, including malaise, fatigue, or achiness Gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain Respiratory, including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis Laboratory and radiologic abnormalities include elevated liver function tests, elevated creatinephosphokinase, elevated creatinine, lymphopenia, and pulmonary infiltrates. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have also been reported. Pancreatitis can occur. This reaction generally occurs in the first 6 weeks of therapy, but has also been reported after asingle dose. If an HSR is suspected, abacavir should be stopped immediately and not restarted\u2014 hypotension and death may occur upon re-challenge . The risk of abacavir HSR is associated with the presence of HLA-B*5701 allele; it is greatly reduced by not using abacavir in those who test positive for the HLA-B*5701 allele.Adolescent (Aged 16 Years)/Adult Dose: 300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily. Trizivir Adolescent (Weight 40 kg)/Adult Dose: One tablet twice daily. EpzicomAdolescent (Aged 16 Years)/Adult Dose: One tablet once daily. Triumeq Adolescent (Aged >12 years; Weight 40 kg)/ Adult Dose: One tablet once daily. Metabolism Systemically metabolized by alcohol and in use fixed-dose combinations such as Trizivir, Epzicom, or Trimeq, the fixed-dosecombination's generic equivalents, in patientswith impaired hepatic function because thedose of abacavir cannot be adjusted. Do not use Trizivir, Epzicom, and Trimeq or the with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50mL/min and patients on dialysis (because ofthe fixed dose of lamivudine).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-4Rare: Increased liver enzymes, elevated blood glucose, elevated triglycerides, and possible increased risk of myocardial infarction (in observational studies in adults). Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Pancreatitis can occur. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use Approval Abacavir is Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in HIV-infected children as part of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) component of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Efficacy Abacavir used either twice daily or once daily has demonstrated durable antiviral efficacy in pediatric clinical trials.1-3A retrospective analysis of observational data from two cohorts of African children aged <16 years suggested lower levels of viral suppression in children receiving first-line abacavir/lamivudine-based ART compared to stavudine/lamivudine-based ART; however, observational data may have multiple confounders and further data collection and analysis are needed before conclusions can be drawn (see What to Start ).4,5 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics in Children Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of abacavir in children aged <12 years have demonstrated that children have more rapid clearance of abacavir than adults and that pediatric doses approximately twice the directly scaled adult dose are necessary to achieve similar systemic exposure.6,7Metabolic clearance of abacavir in adolescents and young adults (ages 13-25 years) is slower than that observed in younger children and approximates clearance seen in older adults.8 Exposure-Response Relationship Plasma area under the drug-concentration-by-time curve (AUC) correlates with virologic efficacy of abacavir, although the association is weak.9,10Intracellular concentrations of NRTIs are most strongly associated with antiviral effectiveness, and the active form of abacavir is the intracellular metabolite carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP).11,12Measurement of is measurement of plasma AUC, so the abacavir plasma AUC is frequently considered as a proxy measurement for intracellularconcentrations. However, this relationship is not sufficiently strong that changes in plasma AUC can be assumed to reflect true changes in intracellular active drug. 13Intracellular CBV-TP concentrations are affected by gender and have been reported to be higher in females than in males.13-15This effect of gender and the PIs (see Drug Interactions section below) on abacavir PK further complicates linkage of clinically available plasma abacavir concentrations with more difficult to obtain\u2014but pharmacodynamically more important\u2014intracellular CBV-TP concentrations. Drug Interactions Abacavir plasma AUC has been reported to be decreased by 17% and 32% with concurrent use of the PIs ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, respectively.16In a study comparing with either ritonavir-boosted lopinavir or nevirapine, abacavir plasma AUC was decreased concurrent use of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir; however, the CBV-TP concentrations appeared to be increased in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir cohort.15When combined with darunavir/ritonavir, abacavir plasma AUC decreased by 27% and 38%, respectively; the CBV-TP AUC and trough concentrations were decreased by 12% and 32%, respectively.17 The mechanism and the clinical significance of these drug interactions with the PIs are unknown and need to be evaluated. No dose adjustments for abacavir or PIs are currently recommended.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-5Study (Reference)Pediatric PENTA-1520Pediatric PENTA-1319Pediatric ARROW21 Adult8Adult13 Location Europe Europe Uganda United States United States N of Subjects 18 14 36 15 15 27 Mean Age Years2 5 7 16 22 45 Subjects UsingPI(s)8 1 0 9 0 N/A Dosing IntervalHours12 24 12 24 12 24 12 12 12 24 Dosemg 8.0a16.0a8.1a16.4a19.6b19.1 300 300 300 amg/kg btotal daily dose in mg/kg (divided doses were given but sometimes in unequal amounts morning and evening) cgeometric mean dAUC0-8 Key to Acronyms: AUC DosingDosing Frequency AdministrationAbacavir 600 mg is administered once daily in adults; however, once-daily use in children remains controversial. The PENTA-13 crossover trial compared abacavir exposure at 16 mg/kg once daily with 8 mg/kg twice daily in 24 children ages 2 to 13 years who had undetectable or low, stable viral loads. This study showed equivalent AUC 0-24for both dosing regimens and improved acceptability of therapy in the once-daily dosing arm.18,19However, trough abacavir plasma concentrations were lower in younger children (ages 2-6 years) receiving the once-daily regimen.19The PENTA-15 crossover trial studied 18 children ages 3 to 36 months, again comparing abacavir 16 mg/kg once daily versus 8 mg/kg twice daily in children with viral loads <400 copies/mL or with stable viral loads on twice-daily abacavir at baseline. Abacavir AUC0-24 and clearance were similar in children on the once- and twice-daily regimens. After the change from twice- daily to once-daily abacavir, viral load remained <400 copies/mL in 16 of 18 participants through 48 weeks of monitoring.20A study of 41 children (aged 3 to 12 years) in Uganda who were stable on twice-daily fixed- dose coformulation of abacavir/lamivudine also showed equivalent AUC0-24and stable clinical outcome (i.e., disease stage and CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] cell count) after the switch to once-daily abacavir during amedian follow-up of 1.15 years. Virologic outcome was not evaluated in this study. 21Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-6Most recently, a pediatric PK model was developed based on data from 69 children in the PENTA-13 and -15 trials and the ARROW study.22Irrespective of age, body weight was identified as the most significant factor influencing the oral clearance of abacavir in children. Predicted steady state peak (Cmax) and AUC0-12 abacavir concentrations on standard twice-daily dosing were lower in toddlers and infants aged 0.4 to 2.8years when compared with children aged 3.6 to 12.8 years. Model-based predictions showed that equivalent systemic plasma abacavir exposure was achieved after once- or twice-daily dosing regimens. The model did not include information on ethnicity and other potentially important demographic factors. No clinical trialshave been conducted involving children who initiated therapy with once-daily dosing of abacavir. None of the pediatric clinical trials evaluated the pharmacodynamically most important intracellular CBV-TP concentrations. All three pediatric studies presented in the table above enrolled only patients who had lowviral loads or were clinically stable on twice-daily abacavir before changing to once-daily dosing. Recentdata from 48-week in the ARROW trial clinical noninferiority of once-daily (336 children) versus twice-daily abacavir (333 children) in combination with a once- or twice-daily lamivudine- based regimen. 3Therefore, as part of a once-daily regimen, the Panel suggests a switch from twice-daily to once-daily dosing of abacavir (at a dose of 16 to 20 mg/kg/dose [maximum of 600 mg] once daily) for clinically stable patients with undetectable viral loads and stable CD4 cell counts for more than 6 months. Toxicity Abacavir has less of an effect on mitochondrial function than zidovudine, stavudine, or didanosine.1,2 References 1. Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA).

The Panel members interpret pharmacokineticdata as suggesting potential increased toxicityat that dose in this age group and manywould use 50 mg/m 2body surface area every 12 hours. Infant Dose (Aged 3 Months to 8 Months): 100 mg/m2body surface area every 12 hours Pediatric Dose of Oral Solution (Age >8 Months): 120 mg/m2body surface area every 12 hours Dose range: 90-150 mg/m2body surface area every 12 hours. Do not exceed maximumadult dose; see table below.

Pancreatitis (less common in children than in adults, more common in adults whendidanosine is used in combination withtenofovir or stavudine) Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension Retinal changes, optic neuritis Insulin resistance/diabetes mellitus Special Instructions Because food decreases absorption of didanosine, adm inistration of didanosine on an empty stomach (30 minutes before or 2 hoursaf ter a meal) generally is recommended. To improve adherence, some practitioners administer didanosine without regard to timingof meals (see text below). Didanosine powder for oral solution and tablets for oral suspension contain antacidsthat may interfere with the absorption of othermedications, including protease inhibitors(PIs). See individual PI for instructions ontiming of administration. This interaction isGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-9Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Absorption: The presence of antacids in didanosine oral solution and tablets for oral suspension has the potential to decrease the absorption of a number of medications if given at the same time. Many of these interactions can be avoided by timing doses to avoid giving other medications concurrently withdidanosine oral solution. Mechanism unknown: Didanosine serum concentrations tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) and this combination should be avoided if possible. Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function can decrease didanosine clearance. Enhanced toxicity: Didanosine mitochondrial toxicity is enhanced by ribavirin. Overlapping toxicities: The combination of stavudine with didanosine may result in enhanced toxicity. That combination should not generally be used (see below). Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Less common (more severe): Peripheral neuropathy, electrolyte abnormalities, and hyperuricemia. Lacticmore pronounced for the buffered (solution) formulation of didanosine than for the enteric-coated formulation, which is protected frombreakdown by gastric acid by the entericcoating instead of co-formulation with antacids. Shake didanosine oral solution well before use. Keep refrigerated; solution is stable for30 days. If using tablets for oral suspension : Tablets are not to be swallowed whole. For fulltherapeutic effect, 2 tablets may be chewed ordispersed in water before administration. Todisperse tablets: add 2 tablets to at least 1 oz(30 mL) of water. Drink entire dispersionimmediately. For children 1 or 2 tablets maybe chewed or dispersed in water beforeadministration. Metabolism Renal excretion 50% Dosing of didanosine in patients with renal insufficiency : Decreased dosage should be used in patients with impaired renal function. Consult manufacturer's prescribinginformation for adjustment of dosage inaccordance Didanosine whenCombined with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate(Tenofovir): This combination should be avoided if possible because of enhanced didanosinetoxicity. No data on this combination in children or adolescents aged <18 years, but decrease indidanosine dose is recommended as inadults.Body Weight (kg) Dose (mg) <60 kg 250 mg once daily 60 kg 400 mg once dailyAdolescent/Adult Dose Body Weight (kg) Dose (mg) <60 kg (limited data in adults)200 mg once daily 60 kg 250 mg once dailyAdult Dose of Didanosine when Combined with TenofovirGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-10acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported, and are more common with didanosine in combination with stavudine. Pancreatitis (less common in children than inadults, more common when didanosine is used in combination with tenofovir or stavudine) can occur.Increased liver enzymes and retinal depigmentation and optic neuritis have been reported. Fall in CD4 Tlymphocyte count is reported with use of didanosine with tenofovir. Rare: Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, presenting clinically with hematemesis, esophageal varices, ascites, and splenomegaly, and associated with increased transaminases, increased alkaline phosphatase,and thrombocytopenia, has been associated with long-term didanosine use. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use Approval Didanosine is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children as part of a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone in combination antiretroviral therapy. DosingStandard Dose in Children Recommended doses of didanosine oral solution in children have traditionally been 90 to 150 mg/m 2body surface area per dose twice daily. Doses higher than 180 mg/m2body surface area twice daily are associated with increased toxicity.1The pharmacokinetic (PK) variable of greatest pharmacodynamic significance is the area under the curve (AUC), with virologic response best with didanosine AUC 0.60 mg*h/L.2,3In a simulation based on didanosine concentration data from 16 children, a dose of 90 mg/m2body surface area twice daily was predicted to result in adequate drug exposure in only 57% of pediatric patients, compared with adequate exposure predicted in 88% of patients at a dose of 120 mg/m2body surface area twice daily,3 so that is the currently recommended dose for children ages 8 months to 3 years. Special Considerations in Ages 2 Weeks to <3 MonthsFor infants ages 2 weeks to 8 months, the FDA recommends 100 mg/m 2body surface area per dose twice daily, increasing to 120 mg/m2body surface area per dose twice daily at age 8 months. However, 2 small studies suggest that a higher AUC is seen in infants aged <6 weeks and that a dose of 100 mg/m2body surface area per day (either as 50 mg/m2body surface area per dose twice daily or 100 mg/m2body surface area once daily) in infants aged <6 weeks achieves AUCs consistent with those seen at higher doses when used in older children.4Therefore, because these PK differences in younger infants (ages 2 weeks-3 months) compared with older children raise concern for increased toxicity in the younger age group, the Panelrecommends a dose of 50 mg/m 2of body surface area twice daily for infants aged younger than 3 months. Frequency of Administration (Once-Daily or Twice-Daily) A once-daily dosing regimen may be preferable to promote adherence, and multiple studies support the favorable PKs and efficacy of once-daily dosing. In a study of 10 children aged 4 to 10 years, enteric-coated(EC) didanosine (Videx EC) administered as a single dose of 240 mg/m 2body surface area once daily was shown to have similar plasma AUC (although lower peak plasma concentrations) compared with theequivalent dose of buffered didanosine. 5The resultant intracellular (active) drug concentrations are unknown. In 24 HIV-infected children, didanosine oral solution at a dose of 180 mg/m2body surface area once daily was compared with 90 mg/m2body surface area twice daily, and the AUC was actually higher in the once- daily group than in the twice-daily group.6Long-term virologic suppression with a once-daily regimen ofGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-11efavirenz, emtricitabine, and didanosine (oral solution or EC beadlet capsules) was reported in 37 treatment- naive children ages 3 to 21 years.7The didanosine dose used in that study was 240 mg/m2/dose once daily, and PK analysis showed no dose changes were needed to reach PK targets.7A European trial of once-daily combination therapy in 36 children ages 3 to 11 years that included didanosine at a dose of 200 to 240 mg/m2 body surface area demonstrated safety and efficacy with up to 96 weeks of follow up.8In 53 children with advanced symptomatic HIV infection, once- versus twice-daily didanosine at a dose of 270 mg/m2body surface area per day showed no difference in surrogate marker or clinical endpoints, except that weight gainwas less in the children given once-daily therapy. 9In 51 children (median age 6.0 years, range 2.5 to 15.0 years) in Burkina Faso, the once-daily combination of didanosine-lamivudine-efavirenz resulted in Week-48viral load <300 copies/mL in 81% of treated participants. That study used didanosine at a dose of 240mg/m 2/day, administered in the fasting state as tablets with a separate antacid (not EC capsules).2 Food Restrictions Although the prescribing information recommends taking didanosine on an empty stomach, this is impractical for infants who must be fed frequently and it may decrease medication adherence by increasing regimencomplexity. A comparison showed that systemic exposure measured by AUC was similar whether didanosineoral solution was given to children with or without food; absorption of didanosine administered with food wasslower and elimination more prolonged. 10To improve adherence, some practitioners administer didanosine without regard to timing of meals. Studies in adults suggest that didanosine can be given without regard tofood. 11,12A European study dosed didanosine oral solution as part of a 4-drug regimen either 1 hour before or 1 hour after meals, but allowed the extended-release formulation to be given without food restriction andshowed good virologic outcome with up to 96 weeks of follow-up. 8 References 1.

Do not use separately with Combivir, Epzicom, or Trizivir because lamivudine is a component of Do not separately when prescribing Truvada, Atripla, Complera, or Stribild becauseemtricitabine is a component of these formulations. Renal elimination: Competition with other compounds that undergo renal elimination (possible competition for renal tubular secretion). Drugs that decrease renal function could decrease clearance. Use with Stribild: If using Stribild, please see the elvitegravir section of the drug appendix for additional information. Major Toxicities More common: Headache, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, rash, and hyperpigmentation/skin discoloration (possibly more common in children). Less common (more severe): Neutropenia. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred in HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV)-coinfected patients who changed from emtricitabine-containing to non-emtricitabine-containing regimens. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use ApprovalEmtricitabine is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for once-daily administration in children, starting at birth. Owing to its once-daily dosing, minimal toxicity, and pediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) data,emtricitabine is commonly used as part of a dual-NRTI backbone in combination antiretroviral therapy. See efavirenz section for pregnancy warning. Complera Adult Dose (Aged 18 Years) : 1 tablet once daily in treatment-naive adults with baseline plasma RNA <100,000 copies/ mL mL or virologically suppressed adults withno history of virologic failure, resistance torilpivirine and other ARVs, and who arecurrently on their first or second regimen. Administer with a meal of at least 400 calories. Stribild Adult Dose (Aged 18 Years) : 1 tablet once daily in treatment-naive or virologically suppressed adults. Administer with a meal.impairment : Decrease dosage in patients with impaired renal function. Consult manufacturer's prescribing information. Do not use Atripla (fixed-dose combination) in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50mL/min or in patients requiring dialysis. Do not use Truvada (fixed-dose combination) in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min or inpatients requiring dialysis. Use Complera with caution in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renaldisease. Increase monitoring for adverseeffects because rilpivirine concentrations maybe increased in patients with severe renalimpairment or end-stage renal disease. Stribild should not be initiated in patients with estimated CrCl <70 mL/min and should bediscontinued in patients with estimated CrCl<50 mL/min.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-15Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics A single-dose PK study of emtricitabine liquid solution and capsules was performed in 25 HIV-infected children ages 2 to 17 years.1Emtricitabine was found to be well absorbed following oral administration, with a mean elimination half-life of 11 hours (range 9.7 to 11.6 hours). Plasma concentrations in childrenreceiving the 6 mg/kg emtricitabine once-daily dose were approximately equivalent to those in adultsreceiving the standard 200-mg dose. A study in South Africa evaluated the PKs of emtricitabine in 20 HIV-exposed infants aged <3 months, given emtricitabine as 3 mg/kg once daily for two, 4-day courses, separated by an interval of 2 weeks. 2 Emtricitabine exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) in neonates receiving 3 mg/kg emtricitabine once dailywas in the range of pediatric patients aged >3 months receiving the recommended emtricitabine dose of 6mg/kg once daily and adults receiving the once-daily recommended 200-mg emtricitabine dose (AUCapproximately 10 hr*ug/mL). Over the first 3 months of life, emtricitabine AUC decreased with increasingage, correlating with an increase in total body clearance of the drug. In a small group of neonates (N = 6)receiving a single dose of emtricitabine 3 mg/kg after a single maternal dose of 600 mg during delivery, theAUC exceeded that seen in adults and older children, but the half-life (9.2 hours) was similar. 3Extensive safety data are lacking in this age range. Efficacy Based on the aforementioned dose-finding study,1emtricitabine was studied at a dose of 6 mg/kg once daily in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in 116 patients aged 3 months to 16 years.4,5PK results were similar, and follow-up data extending to Week 96 indicated that 89% of the ARV-naive and 76% of the ARV-experienced children maintained suppression of plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL (75% of ARV-naivechildren and 67% of ARV-experienced was observed in thistrial. In PACTG P1021, 4emtricitabine at a dose of 6 mg/kg (maximum 240 mg/day as liquid or 200 mg/day as capsules) in combination with didanosine and efavirenz, all given once daily, was studied in 37 ARV-naiveHIV-infected children ages 3 months to 21 years. Eighty-five percent of children achieved HIV RNA <400copies/mL and 72% maintained HIV RNA suppression to <50 copies/mL through 96 weeks of therapy. Themedian CD4 T lymphocyte count rose by 329 cells/mm 3at Week 96. Both emtricitabine and lamivudine have antiviral activity and efficacy against HBV .

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-18Pediatric Use Approval Lamivudine is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for treatment of children aged 3 months, and it is a common component of most nucleoside backbone regimens. Efficacy Lamivudine has been studied in HIV-infected children alone and in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, and extensive data demonstrate that lamivudine appears safe and is associated with clinical improvement andvirologic response, and it is commonly used in HIV-infected children as a component of a dual-nucleoside reversetranscriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone. 2-10In one study, the NRTI components of lamivudine/abacavir were superior to zidovudine/lamivudine or zidovudine/abacavir in long-term virologic efficacy.11 Pharmacokinetics in Infants Because of its safety profile and availability in a liquid formulation, lamivudine has been given to infants during the first 6 weeks of life starting at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 12 hours before age 4 weeks.7A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of infants receiving lamivudine affirms that adjusting the dose of lamivudine from 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg every 12 hours at age 4 weeks for infants with normal maturation of renal function provides optimal lamivudine exposure.12For infants in early life, the higher World Health Organization weight- band dosing (up to 5 times the FDA dose) results in increased plasma concentrations compared to the 2 mg/kg dosing.13In HPTN 040, lamivudine was given for prophylaxis of perinatal transmission in the first 2 weeks of life along with nelfinavir and 6 weeks of zidovudine according to a weight band dosing scheme. All infantsweighing >2,000 g received 6 mg twice daily and infants weighing 2000 g received 4 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. These doses resulted in lamivudine exposure similar to that seen in infants who received the standard 2 mg/kg/dose twice-daily dosing schedule for neonates. 14 Dosing Considerations\u2014Once Daily versus Twice Daily Administration The standard adult dosage for lamivudine is 300 mg once daily, but few data are available regarding once-dailyadministration of lamivudine in children. Population PK data indicate that once-daily dosing of 8 mg/kg leads toarea under the curve (AUC) 0-24values similar to 4 mg/kg twice daily but Cminvalues significantly lower and Cmaxvalues significantly higher in children ages 1 to 18 years.15Intensive PKs of once-daily versus twice-daily dosing of lamivudine were evaluated in HIV-infected children ages 2 to 13 years in the PENTA-13 trial,2and in children 3 to 36 months of age in the PENTA 15 trial.16Both trials were crossover design with doses of lamivudine of 8 mg/kg/once daily or 4 mg/kg/twice daily. AUC0-24and clearance values were similar and most children maintained an undetectable plasma RNA value after the switch. A study of 41 children ages 3 to 12years (median age 7.6 years) in Uganda who were stable on twice-daily lamivudine also showed equivalentAUC 0-24and good clinical outcome (disease stage and CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] cell count) after a switch to once-daily lamivudine, with median follow-up of 1.15 years.17All three studies enrolled only patients who had low viral load or were clinically stable on twice-daily lamivudine before changing to once-daily dosing. Nacro of non-enteric-coated (EC)didanosine, lamivudine, and efavirenz. Fifty-one children ranging in age from 30 months to 15 years wereenrolled in this open-label, Phase II study lasting 12 months. 18The patients had advanced HIV infection with a mean CD4 percentage of 9 and median plasma RNA of 5.51 log10/copies/mL. At 12-month follow-up, 50% of patients had RNA <50 copies/mL and 80% were <300 copies/mL with marked improvements in CD4percentage. Twenty-two percent of patients harbored multi-class-resistant viral strains. While PK values weresimilar to the PENTA and ARROW trials, the study was complicated by use of non-EC didanosine, severeimmunosuppression, and non-clade B virus. In addition, rates of virologic failure and resistance profiles were notseparated by age. Therefore, the Panel supports consideration of switching to once-daily dosing of lamivudinefrom twice-daily dosing in clinically stable patients ages 3 years and older with a reasonable once-daily regimen,an undetectable viral load, and stable CD4 cell count, at a dose of 8 to 10 mg/kg/dose to a maximum of 300 mgonce daily. More long-term clinical trials with viral efficacy endpoints are needed to confirm that once-dailydosing of lamivudine can be used effectively to initiate ARV therapy in children. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-19Lamivudine undergoes intracellular metabolism to its active form, lamivudine triphosphate. adolescents, the mean half-life of intracellular lamivudine (17.7 hours) is considerably that lamivudine in plasma (1.5-2 hours). Intracellular concentrations of lamivudinetriphosphate have been shown to be equivalent with once- and twice-daily dosing in adults and adolescents,supporting a recommendation for once-daily lamivudine dosing in adolescents ages 16 and older who weigh50 kg or more. 19,20 World Health Organization Dosing Weight-band dosing recommendations for lamivudine have been developed for children weighing at least 14 kg and receiving the 150-mg scored tablets.21,22 Both emtricitabine and lamivudine have antiviral activity and efficacy against hepatitis B.

Reported toxicities are more often reported in adults and include serious, even fatal, cases of lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis with or women. Ribavirin and interferon: Hepatic decompensation (sometimes fatal) has occurred in HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), interferon, and ribavirin. Doxorubicin: Simultaneous use of doxorubicin and stavudine should be avoided. Doxorubicin may inhibit the phosphorylation of stavudine to its active form. Major Toxicities More common: Headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, skin rashes, hyperlipidemia, and fat maldistribution. Less common (more severe): Peripheral sensory neuropathy is dose-related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, and in those patients receiving other drugs associated with neuropathy. Pancreatitis. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly withhepatic steatosis, including cases, have been reported. The combination of stavudine withdidanosine may result in enhanced toxicity (increased risk of fatal and nonfatal cases of lactic acidosis,pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and hepatotoxicity), particularly in adults, including pregnantwomen. This combination should not be used for initial therapy. Risk factors found to be associated withlactic acidosis in adults include female gender, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure. 1 Rare: Increased liver enzymes and hepatic toxicity, which may be severe or fatal. Neurologic symptoms including rapidly progressive ascending neuromuscular weakness are most often seen in the setting oflactic acidosis. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ), and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR /). Pediatric Use Approval Although stavudine is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children, its use is limited because it carries a higher risk of side effects associated with mitochondrial toxicity and a higher incidenceof lipoatrophy than other NRTIs. Efficacy Data from multiple pediatric studies of stavudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) agents demonstrate that stavudine appears safe and is associated with clinical and virologic response. 2-8In resource-limited countries, stavudine is frequently a component of initial cART with lamivudine andnevirapine in children, often as a component of fixed-dose combinations not available in the United States. Inthis setting, reported outcomes from observational studies are good; data show substantial increases in theCD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count and complete viral suppression in 50% to 80% of treatment-naive children. 9- 12In such a setting, where pediatric patients are already predisposed to anemia because of malnutrition, parasitic infestations, or sickle cell anemia, stavudine carries a lower risk of hematologic toxicity thanzidovudine, especially in patients receiving cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. 13Short-term use of stavudine in certain settings where access to other ARVs may be limited remains an important strategy for treatment ofchildren. 14,15Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-24Toxicity Stavudine is associated with a higher rate of adverse events than zidovudine in adults and children receiving cART.16,17In a large pediatric natural history study (PACTG 219C), stavudine-containing regimens had a modest\u2014but significantly higher\u2014rate laboratory toxicities than those containing zidovudine,with pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, stavudine use. 17Peripheral neuropathy is an important toxicity associated with stavudine but appears to be less common in children than in adults.3,18In Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) 219C, peripheral neuropathy was recognized in 0.9% of children.17 and Metabolic Abnormalities Lipodystrophy syndrome (LS), and specifically lipoatrophy (loss of subcutaneous fat), are toxicities associated with NRTIs, particularly stavudine, in adults and children.19-22Children with metabolic disorders and abnormalities in body fat distribution, including fat loss and central fat accumulation may potentially beat increased risk of cardiovascular disease in early adulthood. 23,24Stavudine use has consistently been associated with a higher risk of lipodystrophy and other metabolic abnormalities (e.g., insulin resistance) inmultiple pediatric studies involving children from the United States, Europe, Tanzania, Uganda, andThailand. 23-29Lipodystrophy developed in 27% to 66% of children, with lipoatrophy being the most common form of lipodystrophy. The wide range of reported rates of LS is influenced by lack of consensus aboutclinical definition, ability of clinical staff to identify fat abnormalities in children, measurements used todiagnose abnormalities, duration of follow-up, and population differences. Evaluation of LS in Tanzanianchildren found that anthropometric measurements predicted LS in well-nourished children, but generallyfailed to do so in children with lower weights. 26While ever- or current-stavudine use has consistently been associated with a higher risk of LS, additional factors include older age and duration on ARVs.26,27 Improvements in lipodystrophy have been observed among Thai children after discontinuation of stavudinein two separate studies. 28,30Improvement or resolution was reported in 22.9% to 73% of cases. Lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis, including fatal cases, has been reported with use of nucleosideanalogues, including stavudine, alone or in combination with didanosine. 31-33In adults, female gender, higher body mass index (BMI), and lower initial CD4 cell count are risk factors for developing lactic acidosis andhyperlactatemia. 1The combination of stavudine and didanosine in pregnant women has been associated with fatal lactic acidosis and should be used during pregnancy only if no other alternatives are available34(for additional information on lactic acidosis see Table 13g in Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance ). Mechanism Many of the above-mentioned adverse events are believed to be due to mitochondrial toxicity resulting from inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, with depletion of mitochondrial DNA in fat, muscle,peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other tissues. 31,35-37In a recent analysis involving a large cohort of pediatric patients (PACTG protocols 219 and 219C), possible mitochondrial dysfunction was associated withNRTI use, especially in children receiving stavudine and/or lamivudine. 38 World Health Organization Recommendations The World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends that a maximum stavudine dose of 30 mg twice daily be used instead of the FDA-recommended 40 mg twice daily in patients weighing 60 kg ormore. 39,40Several studies have compared the efficacy and toxicity of the two doses. The 30-mg dose is associated with similar efficacy but significantly lower incidence of peripheral neuropathy than the 40-mgdose. 41,42However, the overall incidence of toxicity was considered to be unacceptably high.42Lipoatrophy and peripheral neuropathy are more likely to occur with higher doses but the risk of lactic acidosis isassociated with female gender and a high BMI. 39When data from 48,785 adult patients from 23 HIV programs in resource-limited countries were evaluated, factors associated with higher toxicity rates includedstavudine 40-mg dose, female gender, older age, advanced clinical stage, and low CD4 counts at the time ofGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-25initiation of therapy.43A recent South African study involving 3,910 adult patients on stavudine, confirmed higher rates of drug-related toxicity for peripheral neuropathy (OR 3.12), lipoatrophy (OR 11.8), and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis (OR 8.37) in patients receiving the 40-mg dose compared to the 30-mg dose.Patients receiving the higher dose also were more likely to discontinue stavudine use (OR 1.71) during thefirst year on cART. 44Continued prospective analysis of this cohort has confirmed that treatment initiation with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has lowered drug-related adverse effects and that stavudine use isdeclining in South Africa. 45WHO recommends that stavudine be phased out of use because of concerns about unacceptable toxicity, even at the lower dose, since safer alternative agents may be prescribed. PharmacokineticsCurrent pediatric dosing recommendations are based on early pharmacokinetic (PK) studies designed to achieve exposure (area under the curve) in children similar to that found in adults receiving a dose withproven efficacy. 46These early studies were conducted at a time when treatment options were limited and many children had failure to thrive. The authors in this early PK study state that stavudine distributes in totalbody water and, because total body weight correlates well with lean body mass (or weight), stavudinedosages in obese children should be based on lean body weight. 46 Although WHO has recommended a reduced dose in adults, a similar dose reduction has not been suggestedin children. A reduced pediatric dose has been proposed based on PK modeling, but clinical data onintracellular concentrations of the active stavudine triphosphate are lacking. 47 Formulations The pediatric formulation for stavudine oral solution requires refrigeration and has limited stability once reconstituted. As an alternative dosing method for children, capsules can be opened and dispersed in a smallamount of water, with the appropriate dose drawn up into an oral syringe and administered immediately.Because plasma exposure is equivalent with stavudine administered in an intact or a dispersed capsule,dosing with the dispersal method can be used as an alternative to the oral solution. 48 References 1.

Other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): Didanosine serum concentrations are increased when the drug is co-administered with tenofovir and this combination should be avoided if possible because of increase in didanosine toxicity. Protease inhibitors (PIs): TDF decreases atazanavir plasma without should co-administered with TDF. In atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir increasetenofovir concentrations and could potentiate TDF-associated toxicity. Use of Stribild: If using Stribild, please see the elvitegravir section of the drug appendix for additional information. Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and flatulence. Less common (more severe): TDF caused bone toxicity (osteomalacia and reduced bone density) in animals when given in high doses. Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been reported in both adults and children taking TDF; the clinical significance of these changes is not yet known. Renaltoxicity, including increased in serum phosphate, has been observed. Patients at increased risk of renal glomerular or tubulardysfunction should be closely monitored. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis,including fatal cases, have been reported. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use Approval TDF is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children aged 2 years when used as a component of the two-NRTI backbone in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). TDF has antiviral activity and efficacy against hepatitis B virus (HBV). For a comprehensive review of this topic, and Hepatitis C and tuberculosis during HIV coinfection, please see the Pediatric Opportunistic Infections guidelines . Testing for HBV should be performed prior to starting TDF treatment. Efficacy in Clinical Trials in Adults Compared to Children and Adolescents The standard adult dose of TDF approved by the FDA for adults and children aged 12 years and weight 35 kg is 300 mg once daily; for children ages 2 to 12 years, the FDA-approved dose is 8 mg/kg/doseadministered once daily, which closely approximates the dose of 208 mg/m 2/dose used in early studies in children.1 In adults, the recommended dose is highly effective.2,3 In children aged 12 to <18 years, no difference in viral load response was seen between two groups in arandomized, placebo-controlled trial of TDF 300 mg once daily or placebo, plus an optimized backgroundregimen, in 87 treatment-experienced adolescents in Brazil and Panama 4Subgroup analyses suggest this lack of response was from imbalances in viral susceptibility to the optimized background regimens.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-32In children ages 2 to <12 years, TDF 8 mg/kg/dose once daily showed non-inferiority to twice daily zidovudine- or stavudine-containing cART over 48 weeks of randomized treatment using a snapshotanalysis. 5 Other pediatric studies also suggest that virologic success is related to prior treatment experience. In 115pediatric patients treated with TDF, viral load decreased to <50 copies/mL at 12 months in 50%, 39%, and13% of patients on first-, second-, and third-line therapy, respectively. 6This cohort used a target dose of 8 mg/kg, but 18% of patients were dosed at greater than 120% of the target dose and 37% were dosed at lessthan 80% of the target dose. Pharmacokinetics Relationship of Drug Exposure to Virologic Response and ToxicityVirologic success is related to drug exposure. In a study using a median daily dose of 208 mg/m 2,7lower area under the curve (AUC) plasma tenofovir concentrations were associated with inferior virologic outcome. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in children receiving an investigational 75-mg tablet formulation of TDF showed that a median dose of 208 mg/m2of body surface area (range 161-256 mg/m2body surface area) resulted in a median single dose AUC and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) that were 34% and 27% lower, respectively, compared with values reported in adults administered a daily dose of 300 mg.1,8Renal clearance of tenofovir was approximately 1.5-fold higher in children than previously reported in adults,possibly explaining the lower systemic exposure. 1This lower exposure occurred even though participants were concurrently treated with ritonavir, which boosts tenofovir exposure. Lower-than-anticipated tenofovirexposure was also found in young adults (median age 23 years) treated with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plusTDF, 9although PK modeling in younger patients.10 Formulations Special ConsiderationsThe taste-masked granules that make up the oral powder give the vehicle (e.g., applesauce, yogurt) a gritty consistency. Once mixed in the vehicle, TDF should be administered promptly because, if allowed to sit toolong, its taste becomes bitter. Toxicity BoneDecreased bone mineral density (BMD) has been reported in both adult and pediatric studies. Younger children (i.e., Tanner Stages 1 and 2) may be at higher risk than children with more advanced development(i.e., Tanner Stage 3). 1,11,12In a Phase I/II study of an investigational 75-mg formulation of TDF in 18 heavily pretreated children and adolescents, a >6% decrease in BMD measured by dual-energy x-rayabsorptiometry (DXA) scan was reported in 5 of 15 (33%) children evaluated at Week 48. 1Two of the 5 children who discontinued TDF at 48 weeks experienced partial or complete recovery of BMD by 96weeks. 13Among children with BMD decreases, the median Tanner score was 1 (range 1-3) and mean age was 10.2 years; for children who had no BMD decreases, the median Tanner score was 2.5 (range 1-4) andmedian age was 13.2 years. 7,13In a second study of 6 patients who received the commercially available, 300 mg formulation of TDF, 2 prepubertal children experienced >6% BMD decreases. One of the 2 childrenexperienced a 27% decrease in BMD, necessitating withdrawal of TDF from her cART regimen withsubsequent recovery of BMD.14 Loss of BMD at 48 weeks was associated with higher drug exposure. 7 In the industry-sponsored study that led to FDA approval of TDF in adolescents aged 12 years and weight35 kg, 6 of 33 participants (18%) in the TDF arm experienced a >4% decline in absolute lumbar spineBMD in 48 weeks compared with 1 of 33 participants (3%) in the placebo arm. 4 In the Gilead switch study in children ages 2 to 12 years over the 48 weeks of randomized treatment, totalGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-33body BMD gain was less in the TDF group than in the zidovudine or stavudine group, but the mean rate of lumbar spine BMD gain was similar between groups. At 48 weeks, all participants were offered TDF, and forthe participants who were treated with the drug for 96 weeks, total body BMD zscore declined by -0.338 and lumbar spine BMD z score declined by -0.012. 5 Not all studies of TDF in children have identified a decline in BMD.15,16No effect of TDF on BMD was found in a study in pediatric patients on stable therapy with undetectable viral load who were switched fromstavudine and PI-containing regimens to TDF/lamivudine/efavirenz. 16All patients in this study remained clinically stable and virologically suppressed after switching to the new regimen.17 Monitoring Potential Bone Toxicity The Panel does not recommend routine DXA monitoring for children or adolescents treated with TDF. Given the potential for BMD loss in children treated with TDF, some experts obtain a DXA before initiation of TDFtherapy and approximately 6 months after starting TDF, especially in pre-pubertal patients and those early inpuberty (i.e., Tanner Stages 1 and 2). If DXA results are abnormal consider referral to a subspecialist.Despite the ease of use of a once-daily drug and the efficacy of TDF, the potential for BMD loss during theimportant period of rapid bone accrual in early adolescence is concerning and favors judicious use of TDF inthis age group. Renal New onset or worsening of renal impairment has been reported in adults and children receiving TDF and may be more common in those with higher tenofovir trough plasma concentrations. 18The main target of TDF nephrotoxicity is the renal proximal tubule,19and case reports highlight the infrequent but most severe manifestations of renal Fanconi syndrome, with hypophosphatemia-associated myalgias, hypocalcemia, bonepain clearance (CrCl), and diabetes insipidus, 20,21possibly from genetic polymorphisms related to renal tubular clearance of TDF.22Irreversible renal failure is quite rare but has been reported.23 Renal toxicity leading to discontinuation of TDF was reported in 3.7% (6 of 159) of HIV-1-infected childrentreated with TDF in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 6but subclinical renal tubular damage is more frequent, and increased urinary beta-2 microglobulin was identified in 27% (12 of 44) of children treated with TDFcompared with 4% (2 of 48) of children not treated with TDF. 24An observational cohort study of 2,102 children with HIV in the United States suggested a twofold increased risk of renal disease (increasedcreatinine or proteinuria) in children treated with TDF-containing cART compared to those treated withcART not containing TDF. 25Prospectively evaluated renal function reported for 40 pediatric patients on TDF-containing cART from 5 Spanish hospitals showed that 18 patients had CrCl declines after at least 6months of therapy; 28 patients had decreases in tubular reabsorption of phosphate worsening with longertime on TDF; and 33 patients had proteinuria, including 10 patients with proteinuria in the nephrotic range. 26 TDF-associated proteinuria or chronic kidney disease is more common with longer duration of treatment.27 Of 89 participants aged 2 to 12 years who received TDF in Gilead study 352 (median drug exposure 104weeks), four were discontinued from the study for renal tubular dysfunction, three of whom hadhypophosphatemia and decrease in total body or spine BMD zscore. 5 Monitoring Potential Renal Toxicity Because of the potential for TDF to decrease creatinine clearance and to cause renal tubular dysfunction, measurement of serum creatinine and urine dipstick for protein and glucose prior to drug initiation isrecommended. In asymptomatic individuals, the optimal frequency for routine monitoring of creatinine andrenal tubular function (urine protein and glucose) is unclear. Many panel members monitor creatinine withother blood tests every 3 to 4 months, and urinalysis every 6 to 12 months. Serum phosphate should bemeasured if clinically indicated; renal phosphate loss can occur in the presence of normal creatinine and theabsence of proteinuria. Because nephrotoxicity increases with the duration of TDF treatment, monitoringshould be continued during therapy with the drug.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-34References 1.

Resistance mutations were shown to be present in 29% (5 of 17) of infants born to mothers who receivedzidovudine during pregnancy. 6 Pediatric Use Approval Zidovudine is frequently included as a component of the NRTI backbone for combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).7-23Pediatric experience with zidovudine both for treatment of HIV and for prevention of perinatal transmission is extensive. Special Issues in Neonates Perinatal trial Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group (PACTG) 076 established that zidovudine prophylaxis given during pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and to the newborn reduced risk of perinatal transmission ofHIV by nearly 70% 24(see the Perinatal Guidelines for further discussion on the use of zidovudine for the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV). Although the PACTG 076 study used a zidovudine regimen of2 mg/kg every 6 hours, data from many international studies support twice daily oral infant dosing forprophylaxis. Zidovudine 4 mg/kg body weight every 12 hours is now recommended for neonates/infants 35weeks of gestation for prevention of transmission or treatment (see the Perinatal Guidelines ). For full-term neonates who are diagnosed with HIV infection before age 4 weeks, the zidovudine doseshould be increased at age 4 weeks to the continuation dose (see table above). HIV-exposed but uninfectedinfants should be continued on the initial prophylactic dose until age 6 weeks (see the Perinatal Guidelines ). The activity of the enzymes responsible for glucuronidation is low at birth and increases dramatically overthe first 4 to 6 weeks of life in full-term neonates. For premature infants who are diagnosed with HIV infection, the time to change the dose to continuation dose varies with post-gestational age and clinical status of the neonate. Based on modeling andpharmacokinetics (PK) of zidovudine in premature infants, for infants born at 30 to <35 weeks change to 12mg/kg/dose at post-gestational age 6 to 8 weeks and for infants <30 weeks, change to 12 mg/kg/dose at post-gestational age 8 to 10 weeks. 25Careful clinical assessment of the infant, evaluation of hepatic and renal function, and review of concomitant medications should be performed prior to increasing zidovudine dose tothat recommended for full-term infants. PharmacokineticsOverall, zidovudine PK in pediatric patients aged >3 months are similar to those in adults. Zidovudine undergoes intracellular metabolism to its active form, zidovudine triphosphate. Although the mean half-lifeof intracellular zidovudine triphosphate (9.1 hours) is considerably longer than that of un-metabolizedzidovudine in plasma (1.5 hours), once-daily zidovudine dosing is not recommended because seen with 600-mg, once-daily dosing in adolescents. 26 PK studies, such as PACTG 331, demonstrate that dose adjustments are necessary for premature infantsbecause they have reduced clearance of zidovudine compared with term newborns of similar postnatal age. 8 Zidovudine has good central nervous system (CNS) penetration (cerebrospinal fluid-to-plasma concentrationratio = 0.68) and has been used in children with HIV-related CNS disease. 19 Toxicity Several studies suggest that the adverse hematologic effects of zidovudine may be concentration-dependent, with a higher risk of anemia and neutropenia in patients with higher mean area under the curve.7,8Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-39While the incidence of cardiomyopathy associated with perinatal HIV infection has decreased dramatically since the use of cART became routine, a regimen containing zidovudine may increase the risk.2Recent analysis of data from a U.S.-based, multicenter prospective cohort study (PACTG 219/219C) found thatongoing zidovudine exposure was independently associated with a higher rate of cardiomyopathy. 2 References 1.

Pediatric Dose: Infants and Children Aged 3 Months to <3 Yearsand Weight 3 kg: The Panel recommends that efavirenz generally not be used in children aged 3 months to <3 years. If use of efavirenz is unavoidable due tot he clinical situation, the Panel suggests the use of investigational doses of efavirenz in this age group. See text for investigational dosing t ables; evaluation of CYP 2B6 genotype is required prior to use. Therapeutic drugm onitoring is recommended with an efavirenz concentration measured 2 weeks after initiation; some experts would also measure at age 3 year s when making the dose adjustment. For dose adjustment based on efavirenzconcent rations, consultation with an expert is recommended. Children Aged 3 Years and Weight 10 kg: Weight (kg) Efavirenz Dose (mg)a,b 10 kg to <15 kg 200 mg 15 kg to <20 kg 250 mg 20 kg to <25 kg 300 mg 25 kg to <32.5 kg 350 mg 32.5 kg to <40 kg 400 mg 40 kg 600 mgAdminister Efavirenz Once Daily aThe dose in mg can be dispensed in any combination of capsule strengths. bSome experts recommend a dose of 367 mg/m2body surface area (maximum dose 600 mg) because of concern for under-dosing, especially at the upper end of each weightband (see Pediatric Use for details).Selected Adverse Events Rash Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms such as dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, impaired concentration,psychosis, seizures, suicidality Increased transaminases False-positive with some cannabinoid and benzodiazepine tests Potentially teratogenic Lipohypertrophy, although a causal relationship has not been established and this adverse event may be less likely than with theboosted protease inhibitors Special Instructions Efavirenz can be swallowed as a whole capsule or tablet or administered bysprinkling the contents of an opened capsuleon food as described below. Administer whole capsule or tablet of Atripla on an empty stomach. Avoid administrationwith a high-fat meal because of potential forincreased absorption. Bedtime dosing is recommended, particularly during the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, toimprove tolerability of CNS side effects. Efavirenz should be used with caution in female adolescents and adults withreproductive potential because of the potentialrisk of teratogenicity. Instructions for Use of Capsule as a SprinklePreparation with Food or Formula: Hold capsule horizontally over a small container and carefully twist to open to avoid spillage.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-43Gently mix capsule contents with 1-2 teaspoons of an age-appropriate soft food (e.g., applesauce, grape jelly, yogurt), or reconstitutedinfant formula at room temperature. Administer infant formula mixture using a 10- mL syringe. After administration, an additional 2 teaspoons of food or infant formula must be added to thecontainer, stirred, and dispensed to the patient. Administer within 30 minutes of mixing and do not consume additional food or formula for 2hours after administration Metabolism of efavirenz in patients with hepatic impairment : No recommendation is currently available; use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Adult dose of Atripla in patients with renal impairment : Because Atripla is a fixed-dose combination product and tenofovir andemtricitabine require dose adjustment basedon renal function, Atripla should not be usedin patients with creatinine clearance <50mL/minute or in patients on dialysis. Interpatient variability in efavirenz exposure can be explained in part by polymorphisms inCYP450 with slower metabolizers at higherrisk of toxicity (see text for information abouttherapeutic drug monitoring for managementof mild or moderate toxicity).Adolescent (Body Weight 40 kg)/Adult Dose: 600 mg once daily Atripla Atripla should not be used in pediatric patients <40 kg where the efavirenz dosewould be excessive. Adult Dose: One tablet once daily Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Metabolism: Mixed inducer/inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzymes; concentrations of concomitant drugs can be increased or decreased depending on the specific enzyme pathway involved. There are multiple drug interactions. Importantly, dosage adjustment or the addition of ritonavir may be necessary whenefavirenz is used in fosamprenavir, ormaraviroc. Before efavirenz is administered, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with efavirenz. Major Toxicities More common: Skin rash, increased transaminase levels. Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, such as dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, abnormal thinking, impairedGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-44concentration, amnesia, agitation, depersonalization, hallucinations, euphoria, seizures, primarily reported in adults. Rare: An association between efavirenz and suicidal ideation, suicide, and attempted suicide (especially among those with a history of mental illness or substance abuse) was found in one retrospective analysisof four comparative trials in adults. Potential risk of teratogenicity. Classified as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy Class D, which means that there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on studies in humans (see PediatricUse section below; see also the Perinatal Guidelines ).1 Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use Approval Efavirenz is FDA-approved for use as part of combination antiretroviral therapy in children aged 3 months who weigh at least 3.5 kg. Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacogenomics Efavirenz metabolism is controlled by enzymes that are polymorphically expressed and result in large interpatient variability in drug exposure. CYP2B6 is the primary enzyme for efavirenz metabolism, andpediatric patients with the CYP 2B6 T/T (which has an allele frequency of 20% in AfricanAmericans) have reduced metabolism resulting in higher efavirenz levels compared with those with the G/Gor G/T genotype. 2-5IMPAACT P1070 has shown that aggressive dosing with approximately 40 mg/kg using opened capsules resulted in therapeutic efavirenz concentrations in 68% of children aged <3 years with G/Gor G/T genotype but excessive exposure in dosing may require variant CYP2B6 alleles and variant CYP2A6 alleles have been found to influence efavirenz concentrations in adults and children.7-11 Pharmacokinetics and Dosing: Infants and Children Aged <3 Years Limited pharmacokinetic (PK) data in children aged <3 years or who weigh <13 kg have shown that it is difficult to achieve target trough concentrations in this age group.4,12Hepatic enzyme activity is known to change with age. Using a pharmacometric model, the increase in oral clearance of efavirenz as a function ofage is predicted to reach 90% of mature value by the age of 9 months. 5This maturation of oral clearance is postulated to result from an increase in the expression of CYP 2B6 with age.5CYP 2B6-516-G/G genotype is associated with the greatest expression of hepatic CYP 2B6 when compared with children with CYP 2B6-516-G/G genotype, oral clearance rate has been shown to be higher in children aged <5 years than in older children.2Efficacy data for opened capsules with contents used as sprinkles suggest acceptable palatability and bioavailability for infants and children aged <3 years.IMPAACT study P1070, an ongoing study of HIV-infected and HIV/tuberculosis-coinfected children aged<3 years, using efavirenz dosed by weight band based on CYP2B6 GG/GT versus TT genotype (see Tables1a and 1b below), showed HIV RNA <400 copies/mL in 61% by intent to treat analysis at 24 weeks. 4When used without regard to genotype, doses higher than the FDA-recommended doses resulted in therapeuticefavirenz concentrations in an increased proportion of study participants with GG/GT genotypes butexcessive exposure in a high proportion of those with TT genotypes. 4Therefore, dosing tables have been modified so that infants and young children with TT genotype will receive a reduced dose. Additionalsubjects will be studied to confirm that this dose is appropriate for this subset of patients. The modified doseslisted in Tables 1a and 1b are under investigation.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-45Investigational Dosing for Children Aged 3 Months to <3 Years Based on CYP 2B6 Genotype The FDA has approved efavirenz for use in infants and children aged 3 months to <3 years at doses derived from a population PK model based on data from adult subjects in PACTG 1021 and PACTG 382, and AI266-922, which is an ongoing study assessing the PK, safety, and efficacy of capsule sprinkles in children aged 3months to 6 years (see Table 2). The FDA-approved doses are lower than the CYP 2B6 extensive metabolizer doses and higher than the CYP 2B6 slow metabolizer doses currently under study in P1070. Further studies are needed to determine if theFDA dosing can achieve therapeutic levels for the group aged 3 months to 3 years. There is concern thatFDA-approved doses may result in frequent under-dosing in CYP 2B6 extensive metabolizers. Estimates ofefavirenz area under the curve (AUC) for FDA dosing using P1070 data are given in Table 3. 6Estimates were calculated as follows: A high initial dose of efavirenz in the first version of the P1070 protocol was used to produce a targetAUC of 35 to 180 mcg*h/mL, a systemic exposure similar to that shown to be safe and effective in olderWeight (kg) Efavirenz Dose (mg) 3 kg-4.99 kg 200 mg 5 kg-6.99 kg 300 mg 7 kg-13.99 kg 400 mg 14 kg-16.99 kg 500 mg 17 kg 600 mg Table 1a.

Protocol P1070 Dosing .4Evaluation of CYP 2B6 genotype is required. Therapeutic drug level monitoring is recommended with a trough measured 2 weeks after initiation and at age 3 years for possible dose adjustment. Weight (kg) Efavirenz Dose (mg) 3.5 kg to <5 kg 100 mg 5 kg to <7.5 kg 150 mg 7.5 kg to <15 kg 200 mg 15 kg to <20 kg 250 mgTable 2: FDA-Approved Dosing for Children Aged 3 Months to<3 Years (Without Regard to CYP 2B6 Genotype)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-46children and adults.6Estimates indicate that FDA-recommended doses of efavirenz will excessive in 38% of extensive years, whereas CYP 2B6 genotype-directed dosing resulted inachievement of target of EM children and 89% of SM children. The Panel recommends that efavirenz generally not be used in children aged 3 months to <3 years. If the clinical situation demands use of efavirenz, Panel members recommend determining CYP2B6 genotype(search for laboratory performing this testing at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/labs ). Patients should be classified as extensive CYP GG and GT genotypes 516 TT genotypemetabolizers to guide dosing as indicated by the investigational doses from IMPAACT study P1070 (seeTables 1a and 1b). Whether the doses used are investigational or FDA-approved, efavirenz plasmaconcentrations should be measured 2 weeks post-initiation (see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring ). For dose adjustment, consultation with an expert is recommended. In addition, when dosing following the P1070investigational dose recommendations, some experts would measure efavirenz concentrations at age 3 yearsto guide dose adjustment. Pharmacokinetics: Children Aged 3 Years and Adolescents Long-term HIV RNA suppression has been associated with maintenance of trough efavirenz concentrations >1 mcg/mL in adults. 13Early HIV RNA suppression in children has also been seen with higher drug concentrations. Higher efavirenz troughs of 1.9 mcg/mL were seen in subjects with HIV RNA levels 400copies/mL versus efavirenz troughs of 1.3 mcg/mL in subjects with detectible virus copies/mL). 14In a West African pediatric study, ANRS 12103, early reduction in viral load (by 12 weeks) was greater inchildren with efavirenz minimum plasma concentration (C min) levels >1.1 mcg/mL or area under the curve (AUC) >51 mcg h/mL.15 Even with the use of FDA-approved pediatric dosing in children aged 3 years, efavirenz concentrations can be suboptimal.2,15-19Therefore, some experts recommend therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) with efavirenz and possibly use of higher doses in young children, especially in select clinical situations such as virologic reboundor lack of response in an adherent patient. In one study in which the efavirenz dose was adjusted in response to measurement of the AUC, the median administered efavirenz dose was 13 mg/kg (367 mg/m 2) and the range was from 3 to 23 mg/kg (69-559 mg/m2).14A PK study in 20 children aged 10 to 16 years treated with lopinavir/ritonavir 300 mg/m2twice daily plus efavirenz 350 mg/m2once daily showed adequacy of the lopinavir trough values but suggested that the efavirenz trough was lower than PK targets. The authorstherefore recommended that higher doses of efavirenz might be needed when these drugs are used together. 20 TDM can be considered when using efavirenz in combinations with potentially complex drug interactions.Metabolizer PhenotypeMedian AUC (mcg*h/mL)Number with for bMoore CB, et al.

A side effect commonly seen in children is rash, which was reported in up to 40% of children compared with 27% of adults. The rash is usuallymaculopapular, pruritic, and mild to moderate in severity and rarely requires drug discontinuation. Onset istypically during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Although severe rash and Stevens-Johnson syndrome havebeen reported, they are rare. In adults, CNS symptoms have been reported in more than 50% of patients.These symptoms usually occur early in treatment and rarely require drug discontinuation, but they cansometimes occur or persist for months. Bedtime efavirenz dosing appears to decrease the occurrence andseverity of these neuropsychiatric side effects. For patients who can swallow capsules or tablets, ensuringthat efavirenz is taken on an empty stomach also reduces the occurrence of neuropsychiatric adverse effects.An association between efavirenz and suicidal ideation, suicide, and attempted suicide (especially amongthose with a history of mental illness or substance abuse) was found in one retrospective analysis of fourcomparative trials in adults. 21In several studies, the incidence of neuropsychiatric adverse effects was correlated with efavirenz plasma concentrations and the symptoms occurred more frequently in patientsreceiving higher concentrations. 13,22-25In patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, efavirenz should be used cautiously for initial therapy. Adverse CNS effects occurred in 14% of children receiving efavirenzin clinical studies 26and in 30% of children with efavirenz concentrations greater than 4 mcg/mL.3CNS adverse effects may be harder to detect in children because of the difficulty in assessing neurologicsymptoms such as impaired concentration, sleep disturbances, or behavior disorders in these patients. Toxicity: Potential Risk of Teratogenicity Prenatal efavirenz exposure has been associated with CNS congenital abnormalities in the offspring of cynomolgus monkeys. As of July 2010, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has received prospectivereports of 792 pregnancies exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens, nearly all of which were first-trimesterexposures (718 pregnancies). Birth defects occurred in 17 of 604 live births (first-trimester exposure) and 2of 69 live births (second/third-trimester exposure). One of these prospectively reported defects with first-trimester exposure was a neural tube defect. A single case of anophthalmia with first trimester exposure toefavirenz has also been prospectively reported; however, this case included severe oblique facial clefts andamniotic banding, a known associate with anophthalmia. There have been six retrospective reports offindings consistent with neural tube defects, including meningomyelocele. All mothers were exposed toefavirenz-containing regimens in the first trimester. Although a causal relationship has not been establishedbetween these events and use of efavirenz, similar defects have been observed in preclinical studies ofefavirenz. 27Based on these types of reports, efavirenz has been classified as FDA Pregnancy Class D, which means that there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on studies in humans, but potential benefitsmay warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. A recent updated meta-analysis found no association with the potential for teratogenicity following first- trimester efavirenz exposure. However, because of the low incidence of CNS anomalies in the overallpopulation and relatively small number of exposures in the current literature, continued birth outcomesprospective surveillance is warranted. 28Although the data on the use of efavirenz in pregnancy are reassuring, many experts remain reluctant to consider use of efavirenz in adolescents who are trying toconceive or who are not using effective birth control, so as to avoid the use of efavirenz during the firsttrimester of pregnancy (the primary period of fetal organogenesis). 29Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of efavirenz and should be counseled about the potential risk tothe fetus and desirability of avoiding pregnancy. Alternate antiretroviral regimens that do not includeefavirenz should be strongly considered in women who are planning to become pregnant or who are sexuallyactive and not using effective contraception (if such alternative regimens are acceptable to provider andpatient and will not compromise a woman's health). See Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States .1Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-48Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Note: See Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring . In the setting of potential toxicity, it is reasonable for a clinician to use TDM to determine whether the toxicity is due to an efavirenz concentration in excess of the normal therapeutic range.30,31This is the only setting in which dose reduction would be considered appropriate management of drug toxicity, and even then, it shouldbe used with caution. Also, the Panel recommends TDM when dosing efavirenz in children aged 3 months to<3 years due to variable PK properties in this young age group. An efavirenz concentration, preferably atrough, measured 2 weeks after initiation, and consultation with an expert, is recommended for doseadjustment. Long-term HIV RNA suppression has been associated with maintenance of trough efavirenzconcentrations greater than 1000 ng/mL in adults. 13In addition, some experts would measure efavirenz concentrations at age 3 years for potential dose adjustment if dosing was initiated at age <3 years usinginvestigational dose recommendations.

Adult Dose (Antiretroviral-Experienced Patients): 200 mg twice daily following a mealAntiretroviral-Experienced Children and A dolescents Aged 6-18 Years (and Weighing 16 kg) Body Weight Kilogram (kg)Dose 16 kg to <20 kg 100 mg twice daily 20 kg to <25 kg 125 mg twice daily 25 kg to <30 kg 150 mg twice daily 30 kg 200 mg twice dailyEtravirine (ETR, Intelence, TMC 125) (Last updated March 5, 2015; last reviewed March 5, 2015) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Tablets: 25 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg Selected Adverse Events Nausea Rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, includinghepatic failure. Diarrhea Special Instructions Always administer etravirine following a meal. Area under the curve of etravirine isdecreased by about 50% when the drug istaken on an empty stomach. The type of fooddoes not affect the exposure to etravirine. Etravirine tablets are sensitive to moisture; store at room temperature in originalcontainer with desiccant. Patients unable to swallow etravirine tablets may disperse the tablets in liquid, as follows : Place the tablet(s) in 5 mL (1 teaspoon) ofwater, or at least enough liquid to cover themedication and stir well until the water looksmilky. If desired, add more water oralternatively orange juice or milk. Note:Patients should not place the tablets in orangejuice or milk without first adding water. Theuse of grapefruit juice, warm (>40\u00b0C) drinks,or carbonated beverages should be avoided.Drink immediately, then rinse the glassseveral times with water, orange juice, or milkand completely swallow the rinse each time tomake sure the entire dose is consumed. Dosing of etravirine in patients with hepatic impairment : No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderatehepatic insufficiency. No dosing information isavailable for patients with severe hepaticimpairment.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-51Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Etravirine is associated with multiple drug interactions. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with etravirine. Etravirine should not be co-administered with the following antiretroviral (ARV) drugs: tipranavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, and unboosted protease inhibitors (PIs). It should not be administered with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (i.e., nevirapine,efavirenz, or rilpivirine). Limited data in adults suggest that etravirine may reduce the troughconcentration of raltegravir, 1but no dose adjustment is currently recommended when etravirine and raltegravir are used together. Etravirine significantly reduces plasma concentrations of dolutegravir;dolutegravir should only be used with etravirine when co-administered with atazanavir\\ritonavir,darunavir\\ritonavir, or lopinavir\\ritonavir. Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, diarrhea, and mild rash. Rash occurs most commonly in the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rash generally resolves after 1 to 2 weeks on continued therapy. A history of NNRTI-related rash does not appear to increase the risk of developing rash with etravirine. However, patients who havea history of severe rash with prior NNRTI use should not receive etravirine. Less common (more severe): Peripheral neuropathy, severe rash including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) (including constitutional findings and sometimes organ dysfunctionincluding hepatic failure), and erythema multiforme have been reported. Discontinue etravirineimmediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or HSRs develop (including severe rash orrash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions,conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia). Clinical status including liver transaminases shouldbe monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping etravirine treatment after the onset ofsevere rash may result in a life-threatening reaction. It is recommended that patients who have a priorhistory of severe rash with nevirapine or efavirenz not receive etravirine. Resistance The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Dosing of etravirine in patients with renal impairment : Dose adjustment is not required in patients with renal impairment. Metabolism Etravirine is an inducer of asubstrate for CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2C19. Multiple interactions with antiretroviral agents and other drugs (see text below)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-52Pediatric Use Approval Etravirine is Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in ARV-experienced children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. Efficacy in Clinical Trials The PIANO study (TMC125-C213) was a single-arm, Phase II trial involving 101 ARV treatment- experienced, HIV-1 infected pediatric participants aged 6 to <18 years and weighing 16 kg. Participantseligible for this trial were on an ARV regimen with confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA of at least 500 copies/mLand viral susceptibility to etravirine at screening. All patients received etravirine with an investigator-selected, optimized background regimen of a ritonavir-boosted PI plus nucleoside/nucleotide analoguereverse transcriptase inhibitors and optional enfuvirtide and/or raltegravir. At Week 24, 67% of thesepediatric participants had plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations <400 copies/mL and 52% had <50 copies/mL.At week 48, 56% the participants had <50 copies/mL, with a mean CD4 T lymphocyte cell increase of 156x10 6/mm3.2A greater fraction of children aged 6 to <12 years had plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL than adolescents aged 12 to <18 years (68% versus 48%), which the investigators attributed to less advanceddisease, less prior NNRTI experience at baseline, and better adherence among the children. However, thepopulation pharmacokinetic (PK) data from this Phase II trial (101 treatment-experienced children aged 6-17years) revealed slightly lower etravirine exposures in adolescents (aged 12-17 years) compared with childrenaged 6 to 11 years and with adults (see below). The safety, efficacy, and tolerability of etravirine in treatment-experienced patients was also evaluated in a multicenter retrospective study of 23 multidrug-resistant pediatric patients with a median age of 14.2 years(interquartile range 12.5 to 15.8 years). 3The backbone regimen included at least 2 fully active drugs in 91% of patients. During a median of 48.4 weeks of follow-up, 20 patients (87%) achieved HIV-1 RNA <400copies/mL and 18 of 23 (78%) achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL. No patients showed completeresistance to etravirine after follow up but 3 of the 21 patients who interrupted etravirine treatment becauseof virological or immunological failure had single resistance mutations at baseline. The efficacy of etravirine-containing regimens in children who have previously been treated with an NNRTI is unclear. However, in a multicenter retrospective study involving genotypic resistance data from 120children at eight pediatric centers in Thailand, Puthanakit, et al. 4found that 98% of the children had at least one NNRTI resistance mutation, and 48% had etravirine mutation-weighted scores 4, which would bepredicted to compromise its effectiveness. PharmacokineticsIn a Phase I dose-finding study involving children aged 6 to 17 years, 17 children were given 4 mg/kg twice daily. The PK parameters AUC 12hand Cminwere below preset statistical targets based on prior studies involving adults.5Based on acceptable PK parameters, the higher dose (5.2 mg/kg twice daily; maximum 200 mg per dose) was chosen for evaluation in the Phase II PIANO study. Exposures remained lower in olderadolescents than in adults and younger children, and Asians compared to either white or black participants. 6 Mean AUC0-12h(ng*h/mL) Mean C0h(ng/mL) Children Aged 6-11 Years (N = 41) 5,684 377 Adolescents Aged 12-17 Years (N = 60) 4,895 325 Adults 5,506 393 Key to Acronyms: AUC0-12h= Area under the curve for 12 hours post-dose; C0h= pre-dose concentration during chronic administrationGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-53Etravirine is often combined with ritonavir-boosted darunavir for treatment of HIV-infected adults with prior virologic failure. King et al.7examined PK data from 37 pediatric patients receiving this combination, all receiving the maximum 200-mg etravirine dose. For both drugs, the estimated 90% confidence intervals forAUC and C minfell below targeted lower limits defined using data from studies in adults. While this combination has been effective in a small cohort of HIV-infected adolescents,8and in 51% of participants in the PIANO study,6these data suggest a need for additional study of PK interactions involving etravirine and other ARV agents in pediatric patients, including regimens that do not include ritonavir-boosted PIs. ToxicityIn the PIANO study, rash and diarrhea were the most common adverse drug reactions. Rash ( Grade 2) occurred in 13% of pediatric subjects and emerged at a median of 10 days, lasting a median of 7 days. Rashwas observed more frequently in female subjects (17 of 64; 26.6%) than in male subjects (6 of 37; 16.2%).Etravirine was discontinued due to rash in 4 (4%) individuals, all of whom were female. Diarrhea occurred in3 (3%) and was only reported in adolescents. References 1. Do VT, Higginson RT, Fulco PP. Raltegravir dosage adjustment in Syst at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22011983 . 2.

Treatment of HIV Infection:Pediatric Dose: Immediate Release andSuspension Formulations <8 Years: INVESTIGATIONAL DOSE age < 1 month: 6 m g/kg/dose twice daily (no lead in): ( See Dosing: Special Considerations: Neonates 14 Days and .) 1 month to <8 years: 200 mg/m2of BSA/dose (maximum dose of immediate release tablets is 200 m g twice daily). 8 Years: 120-150 mg/m2BSA/dose (maximum dose of immediate release tablets is 200 mg twice daily or extended release tablets 400 mg once daily.) When adjusting the dose for a growing child,t he mg dose need not be decreased as the child reaches age 8 years; rather, the mg dose is left static to achieve the appropriate mg-per- m2dosage as the child grows, as long as there are no untoward effects. Note: Please see note at bottom of table. P ediatric Dose Extended-Release Formulation (>6 Years) Patients 6 years who are already takingim mediate-release nevirapine twice daily can be switched to nevirapine extended releasewithout lead-in dosing. Note: Please see note at bottom of table.Selected Adverse Events Rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome Symptomatic hepatitis, including fatal hepatic necrosis Severe systemic hypersensitivity syndrome with potential for multisystem organ involvement and shock Special Instructions Shake suspension well before administering and store at room temperature. Can be given without regard to food. Nevirapine-associated skin rash usually occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy. If rash occurs during the initial 14 day lead-inperiod, do not increase dose until rashresolves (see Major Toxicities section). Nevirapine extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole. They cannot be crushed,chewed, or divided. If nevirapine dosing is interrupted for >14 days, nevirapine dosing should be restarted withonce-daily dosing for 14 days, followed byescalation to the full, twice-daily regimen (see Dosing Considerations: Lead-In Requirement ). Most cases of nevirapine-associated hepatic toxicity occur during the first 12 weeks oftherapy; frequent clinical and laboratorymonitoring, including liver function tests(LFTs), is important during this period in urineGuidelines for the Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-55(glucuronidated metabolites). Dosing of nevirapine in patients with renal failure receiving hemodialysis : An additional dose of nevirapine should be given following dialysis. Dosing of nevirapine in patients with hepatic impairment : Nevirapine should not be administered to patients with moderate orsevere hepatic impairment. Adolescent/Adult Dose: 200 m g twice daily or 400 mg extended release once daily. N ote:Nevirapine is initiated at a lower dose and increased in a stepwise fashion to allow induction ofcyt ochrome P450 metabolizing enzymes, which results in increased drug clearance. The occurrenceof rash is diminished by this stepwise increase in dose. Initiate therapy with the age-appropriate dose of the immediate-release formulation once daily( half daily dose) for the first 14 days of therapy. If there is no rash or untoward effect, at 14 days oft herapy, increase to the age-appropriate full dose, administered once daily, of the extended-release preparation. However, in children aged 2 years som e experts initiate nevirapine without a lead-in (see Dosing Considerations: full-dose immediate-r elease nevirapine, extended release tablets can be used without the 200-mg lead-in period. Patients must swallow nevirapine extended release tablets whole. They m ust not be chewed, crushed, or divided. Patients must never take more than onef orm of nevirapine at the same time. Dose should not exceed 400 mg daily.

There is potential for multiple drug interactions. Mutant alleles of CYP2B6 cause increases in nevirapine serum concentrationin a similar manner but to a lesser extent than efavirenz. Altered adverse effect profiles related toelevated nevirapine levels have not been documented probably because there are alternative CYPmetabolic pathways for nevirapine. 1Please see Efavirenz section for further details. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Nevirapine should not be co-administered to patients receiving atazanavir (with orGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-56without ritonavir). Nevirapine increases the metabolism of lopinavir and dosage adjustment is recommended (see Ritonavir-Boosted Lopinavir section ). Major Toxicities Note: not single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis. More common: Skin severe and requiring hospitalization; some life-threatening, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), fever, nausea, headache, and abnormal hepatic transaminases. Nevirapine should be permanently discontinued and not restarted in children oradults who develop severe rash, rash with constitutional symptoms (i.e., fever, oral lesions,conjunctivitis, or blistering), or rash with elevated hepatic transaminases. Nevirapine-associated skin rashusually occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy. If rash occurs during the initial 14-day lead-in period,do not increase dose until rash resolves. However, the risk of developing nevirapine resistance withextended lead-in dosing is unknown and is a concern that must be weighed against a patient's overallability to tolerate the regimen and the current antiviral response. Less common (more severe): Severe, life-threatening, and in rare cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure (these are less common inchildren than adults). The majority of cases occurs in the first 12 weeks of therapy and may be associatedwith rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction. Risk factors for nevirapine-relatedhepatic toxicity in adults include baseline elevation in serum transaminase levels, hepatitis B or hepatitisC infection, female gender, and higher CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count at time of therapy initiation(CD4 cell count >250 cells/mm 3in adult females and >400 cells/mm3in adult males). In children, there is a 3-fold increased risk of rash and hepatotoxicity when children initiate nevirapine with a CD4percentage >15%. 2Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or jointaches, general malaise, and significant hepatic abnormalities. Nevirapine should be permanentlydiscontinued and not restarted in children or adults who develop symptomatic hepatitis, severetransaminase elevations, or hypersensitivity reactions. Resistance The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR ). Pediatric Use ApprovalNevirapine is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for treatment of HIV in children from infancy (aged 15 days) onward and remains a mainstay of therapy especially in resource-limited settings. 3-11The extended-release tablet formulation has been FDA-approved for use in children aged 6 years. Efficacy In infants and children previously exposed to single-dose nevirapine for prevention of perinatal transmission; nevirapine-based, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is less likely than ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based cART to control virus load. In a large randomized clinical trial, P1060, 153 children (mean age 0.7years) previously exposed to nevirapine for perinatal prophylaxis were treated with zidovudine randomized nevirapine versus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. At 24 weeks post-randomization, 24% of children in the zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine arm reached a virologic endpoint(virologic failure defined as <1 log decrease in HIV RNA in Weeks 12-24 or HIV RNA >400 copies/mL atWeek P= 0.0009. When all primary endpoints were considered, including viral failure, death, and treatment discontinuation, the proteaseinhibitor arm remained superior because 40% of children in the nevirapine arm met a primary endpointGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-57versus 22% for the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir arm, P = 0.027.12Similar results were reported in a comparison study of nevirapine versus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in children aged 6 to 36 months not previously exposed to nevirapine, suggesting that ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy is superior to nevirapine-based therapy for infants, regardless of past nevirapine exposure.13 Extended-release nevirapine (400-mg tablets) was approved by the FDA for use in adult patients based ontwo trials: VERxVE and TRANxITION. VERxVE 200 mg of immediate-release nevirapine for 14 days before commencing daily dosing of nevirapine extended release orstandard twice-daily dosing of patients already nevirapine andrandomized them to receive the extended-release tablets or to remain on their current nevirapine regimen.Both studies have shown equivalent efficacy, adverse effect, and CD4 profiles through 144 weeks. 15-17Trial 1100.1518 was an open-label, multiple-dose, non-randomized, crossover trial performed in 85 HIV-1infected pediatric participants aged 3 years to <18 years who had received at least 18 weeks of immediate-release nevirapine and had plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL prior to trial enrollment. Participants werestratified according to age (3 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years). Following a 10-day periodwith immediate-release nevirapine, participants were treated with nevirapine extended-release tablets oncedaily in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for 10 days, after which steady-statepharmacokinetics (PK) were determined. Forty participants who completed the initial part of the study wereenrolled in an optional extension phase of the trial, which evaluated the safety and antiviral activity ofnevirapine extended release through a minimum of 24 weeks of treatment. Of the 40 participants whoentered the treatment extension phase, 39 completed at least 24 weeks of treatment. After 24 weeks or moreof treatment with nevirapine extended release, all 39 participants continued to have plasma HIV-1 RNA <50copies per mL. This dosage form was approved for use in children aged 6 years in November 2012. General Dosing ConsiderationsBody surface area (BSA) has traditionally been used to guide nevirapine dosing in infants and young children. It is important to avoid under-dosing of nevirapine because a single point mutation (K103N) in theHIV genome may confer non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance to both nevirapine andefavirenz. Younger children (8 years of age) have higher apparent oral clearance than older children andrequire a higher dosage to achieve equivalent drug exposure compared with children aged >8 years. 8,9 Because of this, it is recommended that dosing for children younger than age 8 years be 200 mg/m2of BSA per dose when given twice daily (immediate-release tablet maximum dose 200 mg twice daily) or 400 mg/m2 of body surface area per dose when administered once daily as the extended-release preparation (maximumdose of the extended release preparation 400 mg/dose once daily). For children aged 8 years and older, therecommended dose is 120 mg/m 2of BSA per dose (maximum dose 200 mg) administered twice daily to a maximum of 400 mg once daily when the extended-release preparation is used in children aged 6 years.When adjusting the dose in a growing child, the milligram dose need not be decreased (from 200 mg/m 2to 120 mg/m2) as the child reaches 8 years; rather, the milligram dose is left static as long as there are no untoward effects, and the dose is allowed to achieve the appropriate mg/m2dosage as the child grows. Some practitioners dose nevirapine at 150 mg/m2of BSA every 12 hours or 300 mg/m2per dose once daily if using the extended-release preparation (maximum of 200 mg per dose twice daily of the immediate-release tabletsor 400 mg per dose once daily of the extended release tablets) regardless of age, as recommended in theFDA-approved product label. Dosing Considerations: Lead-In Requirement One explanation for the poorer performance of nevirapine in the P1060 trial was the potential for under- dosing during the lead-in period. This potential for under-dosing with an increased risk of resistance has ledto the re-evaluation of lead-in dosing in children who are naive to nevirapine therapy. Traditional dosing ofnevirapine is initiated with an age-appropriate dose once daily (200 mg/m 2in infants 15 days and children <8 years using the immediate release preparations) during the first 2 weeks of treatment to allow for theGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-58auto-induction of the liver enzymes CYP3A and CYP2B6, which are involved in nevirapine metabolism. Studies, largely in adult cohorts, previously indicated the potential for greater drug toxicity without this lead-in. 18The CHAPAS-1 Trial19randomized 211 children to initiate cART with nevirapine without a lead-in (age-appropriate dose, twice daily, of the immediate-release preparation) or with a lead-in (age-appropriatedose, once daily, of the immediate-release preparation) for 2 weeks followed by standard twice-daily dosingof the immediate release preparation. Children were followed for a median of 92 weeks (68-116), and therewas no difference in grade 3 or 4 adverse events between the two groups. The group initiating nevirapinewithout a lead-in had a statistically significant increase in grade 2 rash, but the majority of participants wereable to continue nevirapine therapy after a brief interruption. CD4 and virologic endpoints were no differentthrough 96 weeks. In a sub-study of this trial, the investigators evaluated nevirapine plasma concentrations 3to 4 hours after a morning dose of nevirapine after 2 weeks of therapy. For children <2 years of age, 13%(3/23) initiating at full dose versus 32% (7/22) initiating at half dose had subtherapeutic nevirapine levels (<3mg/L) at 2 weeks (P = 0.16). There were no rash events in the substudy group aged <2 years and in the parent CHAPAS study there was a strong age effect on rash occurrence (increased risk with increasing age),suggesting that a lead-in dose may not be necessary in young patients. 20Reinitiating half-dose nevirapine for another 2 weeks in those children who have interrupted therapy for 7 days or longer has been standardpractice; however, given the current understanding of nevirapine resistance, the half-life of the CYPenzymes, 21and the results of CHAPAS-1, the panel recommends restarting full-dose nevirapine in children who interrupt therapy for 14 days or less. Dosing: Special Considerations: Neonates and Premature InfantsFor neonates and for premature infants (until 42 weeks corrected gestational age), PK data are currently inadequate to formulate an effective complete cART regimen. Although dosing is available for zidovudineand lamivudine, data are inadequate for other classes of cART. Based on PK modeling, an investigationaldose of 6 mg/kg administered twice daily for nevirapine has been proposed for full-term infants diagnosed asinfected in the first few days of life. Because modeling data included infants up to 1 month and target valueswere reached using the investigational dose, a single dosing recommendation of 6 mg/kg/BID for the firstmonth of life was chosen by the Panel to prevent repeated dose changing requirements. Pharmacokinetics ofnevirapine using the investigational dose will be evaluated as part of an IMPAACT protocol. Providersconsidering treatment of infants <2 weeks or premature infants should contact a pediatric HIV expert forguidance because the decision about whether to treat and what to use will involve weighing the risks andbenefits of using unapproved cART dosing, and incorporating case-specific factors such as exposure to ARVprophylaxis.

Pediatric Dose: Not approved for use in children. A clinical trial in t reatment-naive adolescents (aged 12-18 years) is under way using a 25-mg dose. Adolescent (>18 years)/Adult DoseAntiretroviral-Naive Patients with HIV RNA 100,000 copies/mL or RNA <50 copies/ mL) Patients with NoHistory of Virologic Failure or Resistance toRilpivirine and Other ARVs and Currently on TheirFirst or Second Regimen: 25 mg once daily Combination Tablet: Complera (Tenofovir with Emtricitabine plus Rilpivirine): Adult dose (aged years): 1 tablet oncedaily in treatment-naive adults with baselineviral load <100,000 copies/mL or virologicallysuppressed adults with no history of virologicfailure or resistance to rilpivirine and otherARVs and currently on their first or secondregimen.Selected Adverse Events Depression, mood changes Insomnia Headache Rash Hepatotoxicity Special Instructions Patients must be able to take rilpivirine with a meal of at least 400 calories on a regular schedule (a protein drink alone does notconstitute a meal). Do not use rilpivirine with other non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Do not use rilpivirine with proton pump inhibitors. Antacids should only be taken either at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours afterrilpivirine. Use rilpivirine with caution when co- administered with a drug with a known risk oftorsades de pointes (seehttps://www.crediblemeds.org/ ). Do not start rilpivirine in patients with HIV RNA >100,000 copies/mL because 3A substrate Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment : No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Rilpivirine decreases tubular secretion of creatinine and slightly increases measuredGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-61Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Metabolism: Rilpivirine is a CYP 3A substrate and requires dosage adjustments when administered with CYP 3A-modulating medications. Before rilpivirine is administered, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Co-administration of rilpivirine with drugs that increase gastric pH may decrease plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. Antacids should only be taken either at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after rilpivirine. H2-receptor antagonists should only be administered at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after rilpivirine. Rifabutin and rifampin significantly reduce rilpivirine plasma concentrations; therefore, administration of rifabutin or rifampin with rilpivirine is contraindicated. Major Toxicities More common: Insomnia, headache, and rash Less common (more severe): Depression or mood changes Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use ApprovalRilpivirine is approved in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) agents for treatment-naive, HIV- infected adults with viral load 100,000 copies/mL. In addition, the combination tablet rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir (Complera) is approved in virologically-suppressed patients (HIV RNA <50copies/mL) on their first or second regimen with no history of virologic failure or resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). PharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of rilpivirine in pediatric patients have not been established. An international (India, Thailand, Uganda, and South Africa) Phase II trial, Pediatric Study in Adolescentsserum creatinine, but does not affect glomerular filtration. Dosing in patients with renal impairment : No dose adjustment is required in patients withmild or moderate renal impairment. Complera (fixed-dose combinations) should not be used in patients with CrCl <50 mL/minor in patients requiring dialysis. Use rilpivirine with caution in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renaldisease. Increase monitoring for adverseeffects because rilpivirine concentrations maybe increased in patients with severe renalimpairment or end-stage renal disease.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-62Investigating a New NNRTI TMC278 (PAINT) is investigating a 25-mg dose of rilpivirine in combination with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in ARV-naive adolescents aged 12 to <18 years who weigh32 kg and have a viral load 100,000 copies/mL. 1 In the dose-finding phase of the study 11 youth aged >12 to 15 years and 12 youth aged >15 to 18 yearsunderwent intensive PK evaluations after an observed dose of rilpivirine taken with a meal. Results and adultcomparison data are listed in the table below. 2 In a PK study of youth aged 13 to 23 years receiving rilpivirine,3rilpivirine exposure was slightly higher than results from PAINT in those receiving 25 mg rilpivirine without darunavir/ritonavir (AUC = 2380ngxh/mL) and substantially higher in those receiving 25 mg rilpivirine with darunavir/ritonavir (AUC = 6740ngxh/mL). No dose adjustments are currently recommended for adults when rilpivirine is used incombination with darunavir/ritonavir, where a similar 2- to 3-fold increase in rilpivirine exposure has beenreported. 4 Toxicity In the PAINT study the observed adverse events were similar to those reported in adults. Eight adverse events were reported in 5 of 25 participants as being at least possibly related to rilpivirine (e.g., somnolence,nausea, upper abdominal pain, fever, dizziness, headache); all were grade 1 in severity.

Bioavailability is higher for the capsules than for the powder when studied in adults. bFor a child who cannot swallow atazanavir capsules, the Panel advises increasing to an experimental dose of 300mg atazanavir powder plus ritonavir oral solution 80 mg,both once daily with food. This dose is being studied inchildren who weigh 25 to <35 kg (see text). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-65 Administer ritonavir immediately following powder administration. Administer the entire dosage of oral powder within 1 hour of preparation. Because atazanavir can prolong the ECG PR interval, use atazanavir with caution in patients with pre-existing cardiac conductionsystem disease or with other drugs known toprolong the PR interval (e.g., calcium channelblockers, beta-blockers, digoxin, verapamil). Atazanavir absorption is dependent on low pH; therefore, when atazanavir isadministered with medications that altergastric pH, special dosing (see Drug Interactions forrecommendations dosing atazanavir co-administered withbuffered didanosine formulations or antacids,give atazanavir at least 2 hours before or 1hour after antacid or didanosineadministration. The plasma concentration, and therefore therapeutic effect, of atazanavir can beexpected to decrease substantially whenatazanavir is co-administered inhibitors (PPIs). Antiretroviral therapy(ART)-naive patients no more than a 20-mg dose equivalentof omeprazole, which should be takenapproximately 12 hours before boostedatazanavir. Co-administration of atazanavirwith PPIs is not recommended in treatment-experienced patients.

Only boosted atazanavir should be used in combination with tenofovir because tenofovirdecreases atazanavir exposure. fSee Cobicistat section for important information about toxicity, drug interactions, and monitoring of patients who receive cobicistat and the combination of cobicistat andtenofovir.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-67Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Metabolism: Atazanavir is both a substrate of the cytochrome P (CYP) 3A4 enzyme system and has significant interactions with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Atazanavir also competitively inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. Atazanavir is a weak inhibitor ofCYP2C8. There is potential for multiple drug carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with atazanavir before the drug and etravirine should not be co-administeredto patients receiving atazanavir (with or without ritonavir). Efavirenz should not be co-administered withatazanavir in treatment-experienced patients, but may be used in combination with atazanavir 400 mgplus ritonavir boosting in is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and may increase plasma concentrations of raltegravir. This interaction may not be clinically significant. Absorption: Atazanavir absorption is dependent on low gastric pH. When atazanavir is administered with medications that alter gastric pH, dosage adjustment is indicated. No information is available on dosingatazanavir in children when the drug is co-administered with medications that alter gastric pH. Initiation of cobicistat, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A, or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving cobicistat, may increaseplasma concentration of these medications, which may increase the risk of clinically significant adversereactions (including life-threatening or fatal reactions) associated with the concomitant medications. Co-administration of cobicistat with atazanavir in combination with CYP3A inducers may lead to lowerexposure of cobicistat and atazanavir and loss of efficacy of atazanavir and possible resistance. 1Co- administration of cobicistat and atazanavir with some antiretroviral (ARV) agents (e.g., with etravarine,with efavirenz in treatment-experienced patients, with another ARV that requires (PK)enhancement, such as another protease inhibitor [PI] or elvitegravir) may result in decreased plasmaconcentrations of that agent, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Guidelines for dosing atazanavir with antacids, H2 receptor antagonists, and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs)in adults are as follows: Antacids: Atazanavir concentrations are decreased when the drug is with antacids and buffered medications (including buffered didanosine formulations); therefore, atazanavir should be administered 2 hours before or 1 hour after these medications. H2-receptor antagonists (unboosted atazanavir in treatment-naive patients): H2 receptor antagonists are expected to decrease atazanavir concentrations by interfering with absorption of the ARV agent.Atazanavir 400 mg should be administered at least 2 hours before or at least 10 hours after a dose of theH2 receptor antagonist (a single dose of an H2 receptor antagonist should not exceed a dose comparableto famotidine 20 mg; a total daily dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg). H2-receptor antagonists (boosted atazanavir in treatment-naive or treatment-experienced patients): H2 receptor antagonists are expected to decrease atazanavir concentrations by interfering with absorption ofthe ARV . Dose recommendations for H2 receptor antagonists are either a 40-mg dose equivalent offamotidine twice daily for treatment-naive patients or a 20-mg dose equivalent of famotidine twicedaily for treatment-experienced patients. Boosted atazanavir (atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-68should be administered simultaneously with and/or 10 hours after the dose of H2 receptor antagonist. H2-receptor antagonists (boosted atazanavir with tenofovir): Treatment-experienced patients using both tenofovir and H2-receptor antagonists should be given an increased dose of atazanavir (atazanavir 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg plus tenofovir 300 mg). PPIs: Co-administration of PPIs with atazanavir is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and decrease its therapeutic effect. Dose recommendations for therapy-naive patients are20-mg dose equivalent of omeprazole taken approximately 12 hours before boosted atazanavir(atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg). Co-administration of atazanavir with PPIs is treatment-experienced patients. Major Toxicities More common: Indirect hyperbilirubinemia that can result in jaundice or icterus, but is not a marker of hepatic toxicity. Headache, fever, arthralgia, depression, insomnia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and paresthesia. Less common: Prolongation of PR interval of electrocardiogram (ECG). Abnormalities in atrioventricular (A V) conduction generally limited to first-degree A V block, but with rare reports of second-degree A Vblock. Rash, generally mild to moderate, but in rare cases includes life-threatening Stevens-Johnsonsyndrome. Fat maldistribution and lipid abnormalities may be less common than with other PIs.However, the addition of ritonavir to atazanavir is associated with lipid abnormalities but to a lesserextent than with other boosted PIs. Rare: New-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation of pre-existing hemophiliacs, and elevation in serum transaminases. Nephrolithiasis.Hepatotoxicity (patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are at increased risk). Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use ApprovalAtazanavir is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in infants (aged >3 months and weight 10 kg), children, and adolescents. Pharmacokinetics and Dosing Oral Capsule The results of the IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A trial in children and adolescents indicate that, in the absence of ritonavir boosting, atazanavir can achieve protocol-defined PK targets, but only when used at higher doses ofatazanavir (on a mg/kg body weight or mg/m 2body surface area basis) than doses currently recommended in adults. In IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A, children aged >6 to <13 of 520mg/m capsule formulation to achieve PK targets.2Unboosted atazanavir at this dose was well tolerated in those aged <13 years who were able to swallow capsules.3Doses required for older adolescents were greater than the adult approved dose of 400 mg atazanavir given without ritonavir boostingonce daily: adolescents 620 mg/m 2per day.2In this study, the areas under the curve (AUCs) for the unboosted arms were similar to the ritonavir-boosted atazanavir groupsbut the maximum plasma concentration (C max) was higher and minimum plasma concentration (Cmin) lower for the unboosted arms. Median doses of atazanavir in mg/m2both with and without ritonavir boosting from IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A are outlined in the following table. When dosing unboosted atazanavir inpediatric patients, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended to ensure that adequate atazanavirGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-69plasma concentrations have been achieved. A minimum target trough concentration for atazanavir is 150 ng/mL.4Higher target trough concentrations may be required in PI-experienced patients. In the report of the P1020A data, atazanavir satisfied PK criteria at a dose of 205 mg/m2in pediatric subjects when dosed with ritonavir.1However, given the available atazanavir capsule dose strengths, it is not possible to administer the exact mg dose equivalent to the body surface area-based dose. A study of a model-basedapproach using atazanavir concentration-time data from 3 adult studies and 1 pediatric study (P1020A)supports the use of the following weight-based atazanavir/ritonavir doses that are listed in the current FDA-approved product label for children aged 6 to <18 years: 150/100 mg (15 to <20 kg) 200/100 mg (20 to <40 kg) 300/100 mg (40 kg) 5 The modeling used in the study does not assume 100% treatment adherence and has been shown to perform better than conventional modeling.5The authors acknowledge that atazanavir/ritonavir at 250/100 mg appeared to be a more appropriate dose than atazanavir/ritonavir at 200/100 mg for the 35 to <40 kg weightgroup; however, this dose is not achievable with current capsule dose strengths (150, 200, and 300 mg). 5 Some experts would increase atazanavir to 300 mg at 35 kg to avoid underdosing, especially whenadministered with tenofovir. Cobicistat as a Pharmacokinetic Enhancer: No data on the use of cobicistat are available in pediatric patients. Oral Powder: The unboosted atazanavir powder cohorts in IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A were closed based on the inability to achieve target exposures. For the IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A trial, AUC targets were established based onexposures in adults in early studies of unboosted atazanavir. For that study, target AUC range was 30,000 to90,000 ng*hr/mL. Boosted atazanavir powder cohorts in IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A in children ages 3months to 2 years, using a dose of 310 mg/m 2daily, achieved average atazanavir exposures that approached but did not meet protocol targets. Variability in exposures was greater, especially among the very youngchildren in this age range. 2 Assessment of the PK, safety, tolerability, and virologic response of atazanavir oral powder for FDAapproval was based on data from two open-label, multicenter clinical trials: PRINCE I: In pediatric patients aged 3 months to <6 years 6 PRINCE II: In pediatric patients aged 3 months to <11 years7 Sixty-five treated patients from both studies weighing 10 kg to <25 kg were evaluated. All patients in the PRINCE trials were treated with boosted atazanavir. Patients weighing 10 kg to <15 kg received 200 mgSummary of Atazanavir Dosing Information Obtained from IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A2 Age Range (Years) ATV Given with RTV ATV Median Dose (mg/m2a) ATV Median Dose (mga) 6-13 years No 509 475 6-13 years Yes 208 200 >13 years No 620 900 >13 years Yes 195 350 aDose satisfied protocol-defined AUC/PK parameters and met all acceptable safety targets. These doses differ from those recommended by the manufacturer. TDM was used to determine patient-specific dosing in this trial.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-70atazanavir and 80 mg ritonavir oral solution, and patients weighing 15 kg to <25 kg received 250 mg atazanavir and 80 mg ritonavir oral solution. Using a modified ITT analysis, overall proportions of ARV-naive and ARV-experienced patients with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48 were 66% (27/41) and 58%(14/24), respectively. The median increase from baseline in absolute CD4 T lymphocyte count (percent) at 48weeks of therapy was 412 cells/mm 3(10.5%) in ARV-naive patients and 228 cells/mm3(6%) in ARV- experienced patients. No new safety concerns were identified in these trials. The FDA label includes thefollowing PK parameters measured in the PRINCE trials, including mean AUC, for the weight ranges thatcorrespond to the recommended doses: While the PK targets were met in these PK studies of atazanavir powder, there were large CV%, especially in the youngest patients. Transitioning from Powder to Capsules: There is no approved atazanavir powder dose for children who reach a weight 25 kg while taking the powder. Atazanavir capsules should be used for the child who swallows pills. Bioavailability is higher for thecapsules than for the powder when studied in adults; therefore, a lower mg/kg dose is recommended. Openedcapsules have not been studied and so should not be used. For children who reach a weight of 25 kg and whocannot swallow pills, the Panel advises increasing to the experimental dose of 300 mg atazanavir powderplus ritonavir oral solution 80 mg, both once daily with food. The ongoing trial of atazanavir/ritonavirpowder, Prince II trial, is evaluating the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of 300 mg atazanavir powderin children weighing 25 kg to <35 kg. Toxicity Nine percent of patients enrolled in the IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A trial had a bilirubin 5.1 times the upper limit of normal. 3Asymptomatic EKG abnormalities were observed in a small number of patients: Grade 3 QTC prolongation in 1 patient, Grade 2 PR or HR changes in 9 patients, and Grade 3 PR prolongations in 3patients. No significant changes in serum cholesterol or triglycerides were observed during 48 weeks oftherapy in 63 children receiving unboosted atazanavir in combination with 2 NRTIs. 7 References 1.

Pediatric dosing requires co-administration of tablets with different strengths to achieve therecommended doses depending on weightband. Careful instructions to caregivers whenrecommending a combination of different-strength tablets is very important.

Neonate/Infant Dose: Not approved for use in neonates/infants. Pediatric Dose:Aged <3 years: Do not use darunavir in children aged <3 years or weighing 10 kg because of concerns related to seizures and death in infantrats due to immaturity of the blood-brainbarrier and liver metabolic pathways.

Metabolism Cytochrome (CYP) P450 3A4 inhibitor Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Darunavir is primarily metabolized by the liver. There are no data for dosing adult patientswith varying degrees of hepatic impairment;caution should be used when administeringdarunavir to such patients. Darunavir is notrecommended in patients with severe hepaticimpairment. Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment : No dose adjustment is required in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinineclearance [CrCl] 30-60 mL/min). There are noPK data in patients with severe renalimpairment or end-stage renal disease. Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Darunavir is primarily by cytochrome P Both ritonavir and cobicistat are inhibitors of CYP3A4, thereby increasing the plasma concentration of darunavir. Potential exists for multiple drug interactions when either ritonavir or cobicistat is used with darunavir. Co-administration ofdarunavir/ritonavir or darunavir/cobicistat with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A clearancecreates potential for multiple drug-drug interactions and may be associated with serious and/or life-threatening events or suboptimal efficacy. Co-administration of several drugs, including rifampin, isaNote that the dose in children weighing 10 to 15 kg is 20 mg/kg darunavir and 3 mg/kg ritonavir per kg body weight per dose, which is higher than the weight-adjusted dose in children with higher weight. bRitonavir 80 g/mL oral solution cThe 375-mg and 450-mg darunavir doses are rounded for suspension-dose Dose (combination of tablets or 6.8 mLd) plus ritonavir 100 mg (tablet or 1.25 mLe) once daily 40 kg: Darunavir 800 mg (tablet or combination of tablets or 8 mL) plus ritonavir 100 mg (tablet or1.25 mL b) once daily dThe 675 mg darunavir dose is rounded for convenience. eRitonavir 80 mg/mL oral solution Adolescent mg (tablet) or coformulated as Prezcobix once daily with food fSee cobicistat section for important information about toxicity, drug interactions, and monitoring patients who receive cobicistat. Adolescent (Aged 18 Years)/Adult Dose (Treatment-Experienced with at Least One Darunavir Resistance-Associated Mutation): Darunavir 600 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, both twice daily with foodGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-74contraindicated with ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted darunavir. Because data are lacking on the plasma concentrations, darunavir/cobicistat should not be used in combination with efavirenz, nevirapine, andetravirine, or other HIV-1 protease inhibitors (including fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir). Whendarunavir/ritonavir was used twice daily in combination with etravirine in 40 HIV-infected patients aged11 to 20 years, both darunavir and etravirine exposure were lower than that found in adults. 1When darunavir/ritonavir twice daily was used in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) in13 HIV-infected patients aged 13 to years, both tenofovir and darunavir exposures were lower thanthose found in adults treated with the same combination. 2No dose adjustment is currently recommended for use of the combination of darunavir/ritonavir with either of these drugs, but caution is advised andtherapeutic drug monitoring may be potentially useful. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities More common: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and fatigue. Less common: Skin rash, including erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. and spontaneous bleeding in hemophiliacs. Hepatic dysfunction, particularly in patients with underlying risk factors (such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus coinfection, or those with baselineelevation in transaminases). Resistance The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use ApprovalDarunavir co-administered with ritonavir is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a component of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in treatment-naive and treatment-experiencedchildren aged 3 years and older. Efficacy Data from the randomized, open-label, multicenter pediatric trial, which evaluated darunavir with ritonavir twice daily among 80 treatment-experienced children aged 6 to <18 years, demonstrated that 66% of patientshad week 24 plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and 51% had HIV RNA <50 children aged3 to <6 years, 81% of children (out of 21) had viral load <50 copies/mL at week 48. 4 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics in Younger ChildrenAdministration of twice-daily darunavir/ritonavir oral suspension in children aged 3 to <6 years and weighing 10 to <20 kg was conducted in 27 children (see above) who experienced failure of their previouscART regimen and had fewer than 3 darunavir resistance mutations on genotypic testing. 3,5,6The darunavir area under the curve [AUC(0-12h) ], measured as a percent of the adult AUC value, was 128% overall: 140% in subjects weighing 10 to <15 kg and 122% in subjects weighing 15 to <20 kg.3,5,6 Pharmacokinetics in Older Children Using darunavir tablets and ritonavir liquid or tablets, initial pediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation wasbased upon a Phase II randomized, open-label, multicenter study that enrolled 80 treatment-experienced childrenGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-75and adolescents aged 6 to <18 years and weighing 20 kg.7In Part I of the trial, a weight-adjusted dose of darunavir 9 to 15 mg/kg and ritonavir 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg twice daily, equivalent to the standard adult dose of darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily, resulted in inadequate drug exposure in the pediatric populationstudied with 24-hour AUC 91% of the corresponding adult PK parameters. A pediatric dose 20% to 33% higher than the directly scaled adult dose was needed toachieve drug exposure similar to that found in adults and was the dose selected for Part II of the study. Thehigher dose used for the safety and efficacy evaluation was darunavir 11 to 19 mg/kg and ritonavir 1.5 to 2.5mg/kg daily. and 114% of the respective PK values in adults. Doses were giventwice daily and were stratified by body weight bands of 20 to <30 kg and 30 to <40 kg. Based on the findings inthe safety and efficacy portion of the study, current weight-band doses of twice-daily ritonavir-boosted darunavirfor treatment-experienced pediatric patients with weight >20 to kg were selected (see Table A). Dosing Pharmacokinetic EnhancersDarunavir should not be used without a PK enhancer (boosting agent): ritonavir (children and adults) or cobicistat (adults only). A study in 19 Thai children used ritonavir 100 mg capsule twice daily as the boosting dose with twice-dailydarunavir doses of 375 mg (body weight 20 to <30 kg), 450 mg (body weight 30-40 kg), and 600 mg twice daily (body weight 40 kg). 8The darunavir exposures with 100-mg ritonavir twice daily were similar to those obtained in the studies with lower (<100 mg) liquid preparation-based ritonavir doses.7,8The tolerability and PK data from this small study support the higher doses of ritonavir boosting with 100-mg capsule or tablet in children with body weight 20 kg, particularly when lower-dose formulations are unavailable or if a child does not tolerate the liquid ritonavir formulation. Data are not available to evaluate the safety and tolerability of using ritonavir 100 mg tablet/capsule formulations in children who weigh less than 20 kg.

Key to Acronyms: darunavir; RTV = ritonavirGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-76The data on the dosing of cobicistat with darunavir are available in adult patients only.9Data on a fixed-dose combination of 800/150 mg darunavir/cobicistat once daily showed comparable bioavailability to that obtained with 800/100 mg of darunavir/ritonavir once daily.10 Frequency of Administration In February 2013, the FDA approved the use of once-daily darunavir for treatment-naive children and for treatment-experienced children without darunavir resistance-associated mutations (see Table B). To deriveonce-daily pediatric dosing recommendations for younger pediatric subjects aged 3 to <12 years weighing 10 to <40 kg, population PK modeling and simulation was used. 11A dedicated pediatric trial evaluating once-daily darunavir with ritonavir dosing in children aged 6 to <12 years was not conducted. No efficacy data have been obtained regarding use of once-daily darunavir with ritonavir in treatment-naive or treatment-experienced children aged years. Therefore, the Panel recommends dosing darunavir with ritonavir twice daily in children aged >3 years and <12 years (see Once-Daily Dosing section ). The Panel recommends that once- daily darunavir with ritonavir be used only in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 years who do not have darunavir resistance-associated mutations. If darunavir and ritonavir are used once dailyin children aged <12 years, the Panel recommends conducting PK (measurement of plasma concentrations)evaluation (see Therapeutic Drug Monitoring ) and close monitoring of viral load. FDA approval was based on results from 2 small pediatric trials: TMC114-C230 evaluating once-daily dosingin treatment-naive adolescents aged 12 to 18 years and weighing 40 kg (see below) and the TMC114-C228sub-trial evaluating once-daily dosing in treatment-experienced children aged 3 to <6 years (see below). 11-13 Once-Daily Administration in Children Aged <12 Years As part of the TMC114-C228 trial that evaluated twice-daily dosing in treatment-experienced children aged 3 to <12 years, once-daily dosing of darunavir for 2 weeks with PK evaluation was conducted as a sub-study,after which the participants switched back to the twice-daily regimen. 11,14The darunavir/ritonavir dosage for once-daily use in the trial, based on PK simulation (which did not include a relative bioavailability factor),Table B.

Once-Daily Administration in Adolescents Age 12 Years A sub-study of once-daily dosing of darunavir 800 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in 12 treatment-naive adolescents (aged 12-17 years and 40 kg body weight) demonstrated darunavir exposures similar to those seen in adults treated with once-daily darunavir (see Table D).12In this study, the proportion of patients with viral load <50 copies/mL and <400 copies/mL at 48 weeks was 83.3% relationship was observed C0hand outcome (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) in this study. Darunavir exposures were found to be similar to those in adults with once-daily dosing in another studyin which a single dose of darunavir 800 mg with ritonavir 100-mg tablets was administered to 24 subjects with median age 19.5 years (14-23 years). 15However, darunavir exposures were slightly below the lower target concentrations in adolescent patients aged 14 to 17 years (n = 7) within the cohort, suggesting the potentialneed for higher doses in younger adolescents. A single case report suggests the potential therapeutic benefit ofvirologic suppression using an increased darunavir dose with standard ritonavir booster following therapeuticdrug monitoring in a highly treatment-experienced adolescent patient. 16 The efficacy of once-daily darunavir has been established within a limited number of studies in small cohortsof adolescents that reported long-term data on virologic and immunologic outcomes. 13,17 Formulations PalatabilityDarunavir oral suspension is better tasting than the ritonavir oral solution needed for PK boosting, which is seen as a greater challenge to palatability. In a Phase II initial approval study, 27 of the 80 participantsswitched from the ritonavir liquid solution to ritonavir 100-mg capsules, which are much easier to toleratefor children who can swallow pills. 7Switching to the higher dose of ritonavir for the palatability of theTable C.

Boosted fosamprenavir (with ritonavir) is FDA-approved for ARV-naive infants 4 weeksand for treatment-experienced infants 6months; however, the Panel does notrecommend use in infants younger than 6months because of similarly low exposures(see text below). If used in infants as youngas 4 weeks, it should only be administered toinfants born at 38 weeks' gestation or greater. Once-daily dosing is not recommended for any pediatric patient .

Pediatric specific: V omiting was more frequent in children than in adults in clinical trials of fosamprenavir with ritonavir, (20% to 36% vs. 10%, fosamprenavir withoutritonavir (60% vs. 16%, respectively). Neutropenia was also more common in children across all thetrials (15% vs. 3%, respectively). 1 Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use Approval Fosamprenavir is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children as young as age 4 weeks, but The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children (thePanel) recommends use only in children aged 6 months or older. While unboosted fosamprenavir has beenapproved by the FDA for antiretroviral-naive children aged 2 to 5 years, the Panel does not recommendunboosted fosamprenavir for this\u2014or any other\u2014age group because of low exposures and becauseunboosted fosamprenavir may select for mutations associated with resistance to darunavir. 2 Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics Dosing recommendations for fosamprenavir are based on three pediatric studies that enrolled over 200 children aged 4 weeks to 18 years. In two open-label trials in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive childrenaged 2 to 18 years, 3,4fosamprenavir was well-tolerated and effective in suppressing viral load and increasing CD4 T lymphocyte count. However, data were insufficient to support a once-daily dosing regimen of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in children; therefore, once-daily dosing is not recommended for pediatric patients. Pharmacokinetics in Infants In a study of infants, higher doses of both fosamprenavir and ritonavir were used in treatment-naive infants as young as 4 weeks and in treatment-experienced infants as young as 6 months.1,5Exposures in those younger than 6 months were much lower than those achieved in older children and adults and comparable tothose seen with unboosted fosamprenavir. Given these low exposures, limited data, large dosing volumes,unpleasant taste, and the availability of alternatives for infants and young children, the Panel does notrecommend fosamprenavir use in infants younger than 6 months.

Should not be administered to neonates because of the risks associated with hyperbilirubinemia (kernicterus). Pediatric Dose: Not approved for use in children. A range of indinavir doses (234-500 mg/m2 body surface area) boosted with low-dose ritonavir has been studied in children (see textbelow). Adolescent/Adult Dose: 800 mg indinavir plus 100 or 200 mg ritonavir every 12 hoursSelected Adverse Events Nephrolithiasis Gastrointestinal intolerance, nausea Hepatitis Indirect hyperbilirubinemia Hyperlipidemia Headache, asthenia, blurred vision, dizziness, rash, metallic taste, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, and hemolytic anemia Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Special Instructions When given in combination with ritonavir, meal restrictions are not necessary. Adequate hydration is required to minimize risk of nephrolithiasis ( 48 oz of fluid daily in adult patients). If co-administered with didanosine, give indinavir and didanosine 1 hour apart on an empty stomach. Indinavir capsules are sensitive to moisture; store at room temperature (59-86\u00ba F) substrate Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment : Decreased dosage should be used in patientswith mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment(recommended dose for adults is 600 mgindinavir every 8 hours). No dosinginformation is available for children with anydegree of hepatic impairment or for adultswith severe hepatic impairment .Indinavir (IDV, Crixivan) (Last updated February 12, 2014; last reviewed March 5, 2015 ) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Capsules: 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mgGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-84Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Metabolism: CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism. There is potential for multiple drug interactions. Avoid other drugs that cause hyperbilirubinemia, such as atazanavir. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with indinavir. Major ToxicitiesMore common: Nausea, abdominal pain, headache, metallic taste, dizziness, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia (10%), lipid abnormalities, pruritus, and rash. Nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis with deposits. Less hemophiliacs, acute hemolytic anemia, and hepatitis (life-threateningin rare cases). Pediatric specific: The cumulative frequency of nephrolithiasis is higher in children (29%) than in adults (12.4%). Resistance The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use ApprovalIndinavir has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the pediatric population. Although indinavir was one of the first protease inhibitors to be studied in children, its use inpediatrics has never been common and is currently very rare. 1 Dosing Both unboosted and ritonavir-boosted indinavir have been studied in HIV-infected children. Data in children indicate that an unboosted indinavir dose of 500 to 600 mg/m2body surface area given every 8 hours results in peak blood concentrations and area under the curve slightly higher than those in adults but considerablylower trough concentrations. A significant proportion of children have trough indinavir concentrations lessthan the 0.1 mg/L value associated with virologic efficacy in adults. 2-5Studies in small groups of children of a range of ritonavir-boosted indinavir doses have shown that indinavir 500 mg/m2body surface area plus ritonavir 100 mg/m2body surface area twice daily is probably too high,6that indinavir 234 to 250 mg/m2 body surface area plus low-dose ritonavir twice daily is too low,7,8and that indinavir 400 mg/m2body surface area plus ritonavir 100 to 125 mg/m2body surface area twice daily results in exposures approximating those seen with 800 mg indinavir/100 mg ritonavir twice daily in adults, albeit with considerable inter-individualvariability and high rates of toxicity. 8-10 Toxicity The cumulative frequency of nephrolithiasis is substantially higher in children (29%) than in adults (12.4%, range across clinical trials 4.7%-34.4%).11This is likely due to the difficulty in maintaining adequate hydration in children. Finally, a large analysis of more than 2,000 HIV-infected children from PACTG 219Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-85demonstrated a hazard ratio of 1.7 for risk of renal dysfunction in children receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir.12 References 1.

Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Invirase) or inCombination with Maraviroc: Saquinavir and maraviroc doses may need modification (see sections on SQV and MVC). Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Metabolism: CYP450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism. There is potential for multiple drug interactions. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with lopinavir/ritonavir. In patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, fluticasone (a commonlyused inhaled and intranasal steroid) should be avoided and an alternative used. Major ToxicitiesMore common: Diarrhea, headache, asthenia, nausea and vomiting, rash, and hyperlipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia, 1possibly more pronounced in girls than boys.2 Less common (more severe): Fat maldistributionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-89Rare: New-onset bleeding in hemophiliacs, pancreatitis, elevation in serum transaminases, and hepatitis (life-threatening in rare cases). PR interval prolongation.QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes may occur. Special populations\u2014neonates: Lopinavir/ritonavir should not be used in the immediate postnatal period in premature infants because an increased risk of toxicity in premature infants has been reported.These toxicities in premature infants include transient symptomatic threatening bradyarrhthymias and cardiac dysfunction,4-6and lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, central nervous system depression, and respiratory depression.6These toxicities may be from the drug itself and/or from the inactive ingredients in the oral solution, including propylene glycol 15.3%, and ethanol42.4%. 6Transient asymptomatic elevation in 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels has been reported in term newborns treated at birth with lopinavir/ritonavir.3 Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use Approval Lopinavir/ritonavir is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children. Ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer by inhibiting the metabolism of lopinavir and thereby increasing the plasmaconcentration of lopinavir. PharmacokineticsGeneral Considerations There is some controversy about the dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir in children. Children have lower drug exposure than adults when treated with doses that are directly scaled for body surface area. The directly scaled dose approximation of the adult dose in children is calculated by dividing the adult dose by the usual adult body surface area of 1.73 m2. For the adult dose of 400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir, the appropriate pediatric dose would be approximately 230/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2. However, younger children have enhanced lopinavir clearance and need higher drug doses to achieve drug exposures similar to those in adults treated with standard doses. To achieve similar Ctrough to that observed in adults, the pediatric dose needs to be increased 30% over the dose that is directly scaled for body surface area. Lopinavir exposures in infants7-9are compared to those in older children10 and adults11in the table below.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-90Models suggest that diet, body weight and postnatal age are important factors in lopinavir PK, with improved bioavailability as dietary fat increases over the first year of life12and with clearance slowing by age 2.3 years.13 A study from the UK and Ireland in children ages 5.6 to 12.8 years at the time of lopinavir/ritonavir initiationthat compared outcomes in children treated with 230 mg/m 2/dose versus 300 mg/m2/dose suggests that the higher doses were associated with improved long-term viral load suppression.14 Pharmacokinetics and Dosing 6 Months to 12 Years (Without Concurrent Nevirapine, Efavirenz, Fosamprenavir, or Nelfinavir)Lower trough concentrations have been observed in children receiving 230 mg/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m 2of body surface area when compared to the 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2of body surface area per dose twice-daily dose (see table and Verweel, Burger, 200716). Therefore, some clinicians choose to initiate therapy in children ages 6 months to 12 years using 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2of body surface area per dose twice daily (when given without nevirapine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir, or nelfinavir) lopinavir/ritonavir per m 2of body surface area per dose twice daily. For infants receiving 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2of body surface area per dose twice daily, immediate dose reduction at age 12 months is not recommended; many practitioners would allow patients to\"grow into\" the 230 mg/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m 2of body surface area per dose twice daily dosage as they gain weight over time. Some would continue the infant dose (300 mg/m2of body surface area per dose twice daily) while on lopinavir/ritonavir liquid formulation. Younger Than 6 Weeks to 6 Months (Without Concurrent Nevirapine, Efavirenz, Fosamprenavir, or Nelfinavir) The PK of the oral solution at approximately 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2body surface area per dose twice daily was evaluated in infants younger than age 6 weeks8and infants ages 6 weeks to 6 months.7 Even at this higher dose, pre-dose (Ctrough ) levels were highly variable but were lower in infants than in children older than age 6 months and were lowest in the youngest infants ages 6 weeks or younger comparedwith those ages 6 weeks to 6 months. By age 12 months, lopinavir area under the curve (AUC) was similar tothat found in older children. 9Because infants grow rapidly in the first months of life, it is important to optimize lopinavir dosing by adjusting the dose at frequent intervals. Given the safety of doses as high as 400mg/m 2body surface area in older children and adolescents,15some practitioners anticipate rapid infant growth and prescribe doses somewhat higher than the 300 mg/m2body surface area dose to allow for projected growth between clinic appointments.Adults11Children10Children10 Infantsaat 12 Months9Infants 6 weeks- 6 months7Infants <6 weeks8 N 19 12 15 20 18 9 mg 12.5 12.1 9.4 5.2 Ctroughmcg/mL 7.1 4.7 7.9 4.9 2.7 2.5 Cminmcg/mL 5.5 3.4 6.5 3.8 2.0 1.4 aData generated in study cited but not reported in final manuscript.

Higher doses of lopinavir are recommended if the drug is given in combination with nevirapine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir, ornelfinavir. In 14 children treated with 230 mg/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m 2body surface area per dose twice daily plus nevirapine, the mean lopinavir Ctrough was 3.77 \u00b1 3.57 mcg/mL.10Not only are these trough plasma concentrations lower than those found in adults treated with standard doses of lopinavir/ritonavir, butthe variability in concentration is much higher in children than in adults. 10,16In a study of 15 HIV-infected children 5.7 to 16.3 years treated with the combination of 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2body surface area per dose twice daily plus efavirenz 14 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily there was a 34-fold inter-individual variation in lopinavir trough concentrations, and 5 of 15 (33%) children had lopinavir12-hour trough concentrations less than 1.0 mcg/mL, the plasma concentration needed to inhibit wild-typeHIV . 17A PK study in 20 children ages 10 to 16 years treated with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir 300 mg/75 mg per m2body surface area twice daily plus efavirenz 350 mg/m2body surface area once daily showed only 1 (6.6%) patient with sub-therapeutic lopinavir trough concentrations,18perhaps because of the use of a lower efavirenz dose of approximately 11 mg/kg body weight,18compared with efavirenz 14 mg/kg DailyOnce-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir 800 mg/200 mg administered as a single daily dose is FDA- approved for treatment of HIV infection in therapy-naive adults older than age 18 years. However,once-daily administration cannot be recommended for use in children in the absence of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) . There is high inter-individual variability in drug exposure and trough plasma concentrations below the therapeutic range for wild-type virus as demonstrated in studies of antiretroviral(ARV)-naive children and adolescents. 19-22Compared with the soft-gel formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir, the tablet formulation has lower variability in trough levels22,23but the Panel remains concerned about the long- term effectiveness of once-daily ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in children. Dosing and Its Relation to Efficacy Lopinavir/ritonavir is effective in treatment-experienced patients with severe immune suppression,24,25 although patients with greater prior exposure to ARVs may have slower reductions in viral load to undetectable concentrations25,26and less robust response in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) percentage.27Twice daily doses of lopinavir used in this cohort were 230 to 300 mg/m2body surface area in 39% of patients, 300 to 400 mg/m2body surface area in 35%, and greater than 400 mg/m2body surface area per dose in 4%.27 More important than viral resistance to lopinavir is the relationship of the drug exposure (trough plasma concentration measured just before a dose, or Ctrough ) to the susceptibility of the HIV-1 isolate (EC50). The ratio of Ctrough to EC50is called the inhibitory quotient (IQ), and in both adults and children treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, viral load reduction is more closely associated with IQ than with either the Ctrough or EC50 alone.28-30A study of the practical application of the IQ to guide therapy using higher doses of lopinavir/ritonavir in children and adolescents to reach a target IQ of 15 showed the safety and tolerability ofdoses of 400 mg/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m 2body surface area per dose twice daily (without fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, nevirapine, or efavirenz) and 480 mg/120 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2body surface area per dose twice daily (with nevirapine or efavirenz).15Results of a modeling study suggest that standard doses of lopinavir/ritonavir may be inadequate for treatment-experienced children and suggest the potentialutility of TDM when lopinavir/ritonavir is used in children previously treated with protease inhibitors. 31 Formulations PalatabilityThe poor palatability of the lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution can be a significant challenge to medicationGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-92adherence for some children and families. Numbing of the taste buds with ice chips before or after administration of the solution, masking of the taste by administration with sweet or tangy foods, chocolatesyrup, or peanut butter, for example, or by having the pharmacist flavor the solution prior to dispensing, areexamples of interventions that may improve tolerability. Alternative pediatric formulations are currentlybeing developed. 32 Do Not Use Crushed Tablets Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets must be swallowed whole. Crushed tablets are slowly and erratically absorbed, and result in significantly reduced AUC, Cmax, and Ctrough compared with swallowing the whole tablet. The variability of the reduced exposure with the crushed tablets (5% to 75% reduction in AUC) means that a dosemodification cannot be relied on to overcome the reduced absorption. Crushed tablets cannot berecommended for use. 33In a PK study using a generic adult formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir manufactured in Thailand, 21 of 54 children were administered cut (not crushed) pills and had adequate lopinavir Ctrough measurements.23 Toxicity Weight GainCompared with children treated with NNRTI-based regimens, those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir may have less robust weight gain and smaller increases in CD4 percentage. 34-37The poor weight gain associated with lopinavir/ritonavir is not understood, but may be related to aversion to the taste of the liquid formulation ordecreased appetite.

Pediatric Dose (Aged 2-13 Years): 250-mg tablets or two 625-mg tablets) twice daily Some adolescents require higher doses than adults to achieve equivalent drug exposures. Consider using therapeutic drug monitoring toguide appropriate dosing.Selected Adverse Events Diarrhea Hyperlipidemia Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increase in bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Serum transaminase elevations Special Instructions Administer nelfinavir with meal or light snack. If co-administered with didanosine, administer nelfinavir 2 hours before or 1 hour after didanosine. Patients unable to swallow nelfinavir tablets can dissolve the tablets in a small amount ofwater. Once tablets are dissolved, patientsshould mix the cloudy mixture well andconsume it immediately. The glass should berinsed with water and the rinse swallowed toensure that the entire dose is consumed.Tablets can also be crushed and administeredwith pudding or other nonacidic foods.

Less common (more severe): Exacerbation of chronic liver disease, fat redistribution. Rare: mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation of pre-existing bleeding and elevations in transaminases. ResistanceThe International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use Approval Nelfinavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) approved for use in combination with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in children 2 to 13 years of age. Nelfinavir is not recommended for treatment of children aged <2years. Efficacy in Pediatric Clinical Trials Nelfinavir in combination with other antiretroviral drugs has been extensively studied in HIV-infected children. 1-8In randomized trials of children aged 2 to 13 years receiving nelfinavir as part of triple combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the proportion of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mLthrough 48 weeks of therapy has been quite variable, ranging from 26% to 69%. The antiviral response tonelfinavir is significantly less in children younger than age 2 years than in older children. 6,8,19In clinical studies, virologic and immunologic response to nelfinavir-based therapy has varied according to the patient'sage or prior history of cART, the number of drugs included in the combination regimen, and dose ofnelfinavir used. Pharmacokinetics: Exposure-Response Relationships The relatively poor ability of nelfinavir to control plasma viremia in infants and children in clinical trials may be related to lower potency compared with other PIs or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors,as well as highly variable drug exposure, metabolism, and poor patient acceptance of availableformulations. 9-11 Administration of nelfinavir with food increases nelfinavir exposure (area under the curve increased by asmuch as five fold) and decreases pharmacokinetic (PK) variability relative to the fasted state. Drug exposuremay be even more unpredictable in pediatric patients than in adults because of increased clearance ofnelfinavir observed in children, and difficulties in taking nelfinavir with sufficient food to improvebioavailability. A pediatric powder formulation, no longer available, was poorly tolerated when mixed withfood or formula. In the PENTA-7 trial, 35% (7 of 20) of infants started on powder at initiation of therapywere switched from the powder to crushed tablets because of difficulty administering the oral formulation tothe infants. 1A slurry made by dissolving nelfinavir tablets in water or other liquids can be administered to children who are unable to swallow tablets. The bioavailability of dissolved nelfinavir tablets is comparableto that of tablets swallowed whole. 12 Nelfinavir is metabolized by multiple CYP-450 enzymes including CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. M8, the majoroxidative metabolite, has in vitro antiviral activity comparable to the parent drug. The variability of drug exposure at any given dose is much higher for children than for adults, 13which has been attributed\u2014at least in part\u2014to differences in the diets of children and adults. Two population PK studies of nelfinavir and itsactive metabolite, M8, describe the large intersubject variability observed in children. 14,15Analysis of data from PACTG 377 and PACTG 366 showed that CYP2C19 genotypes altered nelfinavir PKs and the virologicGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-97responses to combination therapy in HIV-1-infected children. These findings suggest that CYP2C19 genotypes are important of nelfinavir PKs and virologic response in HIV-1-infected children.9 Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between nelfinavir trough concentrations and virologicresponse. In both children and adults, an increased risk of virologic failure was associated with low nelfinavirdrug exposure, particularly with a nelfinavir minimum plasma concentration (C min) <1.0 mcg/mL.16-18 In a study of 32 children treated with nelfinavir 90 mg/kg/day divided into 2 or 3 doses a day, 80% ofchildren with morning trough nelfinavir plasma concentration >0.8 mcg/mL had Week 48 HIV RNAconcentrations <50 copies/mL, compared with only 29% of those with morning trough <0.8 mcg/mL. 22It is of note that the median age of the group with Ctrough <0.8 mcg/mL was 3.8 years, while the median age of the group with Ctrough >0.8 mcg/mL was 8.3 years.22Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of nelfinavir plasma concentrations, with appropriate adjustments for low drug exposure, results in improved outcome inadults treated with nelfinavir. 16,23Similarly, better virologic responses were demonstrated in two pediatric trials in which TDM was used to guide dosing;15,24doses higher than those recommended in adults may be required in some patients. Infants have even lower drug exposures and higher variability in plasmaconcentrations than children weighing <25 kg; the presence of lower peak drug concentrations and higherapparent oral clearance suggests that both poor absorption and more rapid metabolism may be contributingfactors. 20,21Given the higher variability of nelfinavir plasma concentrations in infants and children, nelfinavir is not recommended for use in children younger than age 2 years.

Potential exists for multiple drug interactions. Co-administration of saquinavir is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities More common: Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, headache, nausea, paresthesia, skin rash, and lipid abnormalities. Less common (more severe): Exacerbation of chronic hemophiliacs, pancreatitis, and elevation in serum transaminases. The combination of saquinavir and ritonavir could lead to prolonged PR and/or QT intervals with potentialfor heart block and ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes). Resistance The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use ApprovalSaquinavir is not Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in children. EfficacySaquinavir has been studied with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and other protease inhibitors in HIV-infected children. 1-6Saquinavir/ritonavir and saquinavir/lopinavir/ritonavir regimens were considered for salvage therapy in children prior to the emergence of the new classes of antiretroviralmedications. 1,3-9 Pharmacokinetics Studies suggest that saquinavir should not be used without boosting by ritonavir or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. A pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of 5 children younger than 2 years and 13 children aged 2 to 5 years using adose of 50 mg/kg twice daily with ritonavir boosting demonstrated that drug exposure was lower in children younger than 2 years whereas drug exposure was adequate in those aged 2 to 5 years. 10For this reason, saquinavir should not be administered to children aged <2 years. In children aged 2 years, a dose of 50 mg/kg twice daily (maximum dose = 1000 mg) boosted with ritonavir 3 mg/kg twice daily (patients weighing 5 to <15 kg) or 2.5 mg/kg twice daily (patients weighing 15-40 kg) resulted in area under the curve and steady-state trough plasma concentration (Ctrough ) values similar to those in older children7,8and adults. In a study of 18 children (median age 14.2 years, range 7.7-17.6 years) evaluating the addition of saquinavir (750 mg/m2body surface area every 12 hours, maximum dose 1600 mg) to a regimen containing lopinavir/ritonavir dosed at 400/100 mg/m2body surface area twice daily (for patients not concurrently taking a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]) or lopinavir/ritonavir 480/120 mg/m2body surface area twice daily for patients concurrently administered an NNRTI, the addition of saquinavir wasGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-101well tolerated and did not appear to alter lopinavir PKs. Saquinavir required dose adjustment in four patients (decreased in three, increased in one).9 In a study of 50 Thai children, saquinavir/lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated as second-line therapy based onextensive NRTI resistance (saquinavir was dosed and lopinavir/ritonavir was dosed at 230/57.5 mg/m2body surface area, all twice daily). After 96 weeks, 74% of the children achieved an undetectable plasma RNA load at <50 copies/mL. Therapeutic drug monitoring was used to establishadequate minimum plasma concentration (C min) values and to aid with alterations in drug dosage based upon toxicity. Most Cminvalues for saquinavir were above the desired trough value of 0.1 mg/L. The average Cminthroughout 96 weeks for saquinavir was 1.37 mg/L, and when saquinavir doses were adjusted, most were decreased by an average of 21% (8 mg/kg).7,8 Toxicity In a healthy adult volunteer study, saquinavir/ritonavir use was associated with increases in both QT and PR intervals.11,12Rare cases of torsades de pointes and complete heart block have been reported in post- marketing surveillance. Saquinavir/ritonavir is not recommended for patients with any of the followingconditions: documented congenital or acquired QT complete atrioventricular block withoutimplanted pacemakers, at risk of complete A V block, or receiving other drugs that prolong QT interval. Anelectrocardiogram is recommended before initiation of therapy with saquinavir and should be consideredduring therapy. References 1. Ananworanich J, Kosalaraksa P, Hill A, et al.

The ritonavir boosting dose used for tipranavir is higher than that used for otherprotease inhibitors. Pediatric Dose (Aged <2 Years): Not approved for use in children aged <2 years. Pediatric Dose (Aged 2-18 Years): Note: Not recommended for treatment-naive Tipranavir 375 mg/m 150 mg/m2, Maximum Dose: Tipranavir 500 mg plus ritonavir 200 mg, both twice Weight-Based Dosing: Tipranavir 14 mg/kg plus ritonavir 6 mg/kg, daily Maximum Dose: Tipranavir 500 mg plus ritonavir 200 mg, both twice daily Adult Dose: Note: Not recommended for treatment-naive patients Tipranavir 500 mg (two 250-mg capsules) plus ritonavir 200 mg, both twice dailySelected Adverse Events Rare cases of fatal and non-fatal intracranial hemorrhage Skin rash (more common in children than adults) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Hepatotoxicity Hyperlipidemia Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Special Instructions Administer tipranavir and ritonavir together with food. Tipranavir oral solution contains 116 IU vitamin E/mL, which is significantly higherthan the reference daily intake for vitamin E.Patients taking the oral solution should avoidtaking any form of supplemental vitamin Ethat contains more vitamin E than found in astandard multivitamin. Tipranavir contains a sulfonamide moiety and should be used with caution in patients withsulfonamide allergy. Store tipranavir oral solution at room temperature, 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F); do not refrigerateor freeze. Oral solution must be used within60 days after the bottle is first opened. Store unopened bottles of oral tipranavir capsules in a refrigerator at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0Fto 46\u00b0F). Once bottle is opened, capsules canbe kept at room temperature (maximum of77\u00b0F or 25\u00b0C) if used within 60 days. Use tipranavir with caution in patients whoTipranavir (TPV, APTIVUS) (Last updated March 5, 2015; last reviewed March 5, 2015) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Oral Solution: 100 mg tipranavir/mL, with 116 International Units (IU) vitamin E/mL Capsules: 250 mgGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-104may be at increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, including individuals with brainlesion, head trauma, recent neurosurgery,coagulopathy, hypertension, or alcoholism, orwho use anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents(including vitamin E). Use of tipranavir is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic Metabolism Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducer and substrate Dosing in patients with renal impairment : No dose adjustment required Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment : No dose adjustment required for mild hepaticimpairment; use contraindicated formoderate-to-severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Tipranavir (TPV) has the potential for multiple drug interactions. Co-administration of tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r) with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance or are potent CYP3A inducers is contraindicated. Before tipranavir is administrated, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Tipranavir should be used with caution in patients who are receiving medications known to increase the risk of bleeding, such as antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, or high doses of supplemental vitamin E. Major Toxicities More common: Diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, rash (more frequent in children than in adults), and vomiting. Elevated transaminases, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Less common (more severe): Lipodystrophy. Hepatotoxicity: clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation, including some fatalities. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C coinfection or elevations in transaminases are at increased risk of developing further transaminase elevations or hepaticdecompensation Increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Tipranavirshould be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery,or other medical conditions. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-105Pediatric Use Approval and General Considerations TPV is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children aged 2 years who are treatment- experienced and infected with HIV strains resistant to more than one protease inhibitor (PI).1The use of TPV is limited by the high pill burden imposed on patients taking TPV capsules, including the burden of taking ahigher dose of boosting ritonavir than is required with other PIs. This increased dose of ritonavir isassociated with greater potential for drug interactions and increased toxicity. In addition, TPV is associatedwith serious adverse events that limit its use to patients with few treatment options. However, TPV isapproved for use in children as young as 2 years and is available in a liquid formulation. EfficacyFDA approval of tipranavir was based on a multicenter, pediatric study of the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of TPV/r in HIV-infected children (PACTG 1051/BI-1182.14). 2This enrolled treatment-experienced children (with the exception of three treatment-naive patients) aged 2 to 18 years(median age 11.7 years) with baseline HIV RNA 1,500 copies/mL. Children in three age strata wererandomized to two different doses of tipranavir/ritonavir: TPV/r 290 mg/115 mg per m 2body surface area (low dose, 58 patients) or TPV/r 375 mg/150 mg/m2body surface area (high dose, 57 patients) twice daily, plus optimized background therapy. At baseline, resistance to all commercially available PIs was present ingreater than 50% of patient isolates, and the TPV/r mutation scores increased with age. 2At 48 weeks, 39.7% of patients receiving the low dose and 45.6% of those receiving the high dose had viral loads <400copies/mL. The groups did not differ in percentage of patients who achieved viral loads <50 copies/mL. HIVRNA levels <400 copies/mL tended to be seen in a greater proportion of the youngest patients (70%), whohad less baseline resistance. TPV treatment was associated with a mean increase in CD4 T lymphocyte countof 100 cells/mm 3and 59 cells/mm3in low- and high-dose groups, respectively, at week 48. Recently, the 5- year long-term follow-up to evaluate safety, efficacy, and tolerability of patients enrolled in PACTG 1051was reported. 3At week 288, most children were no longer receiving TPV/r. Reasons for discontinuation included adverse events, virologic failure, and non-adherence. The youngest patients who were stable atweek 48 were more likely to still be on treatment after 5 years with continued efficacy. 3 Pharmacokinetics PK evaluation of the liquid formulation at steady state in children was assessed.4In children aged 2 to <12 years, at a dosage of TPV/r 290/115 mg/m2body surface area, TPV trough concentrations were consistent with those achieved in adults receiving standard TPV/r 500 mg/200 mg dosing. However, children aged 12 to 18 years required a higher dose (375/150 mg/m2body surface area, 30% higher than the directly scaled adult dose) to achieve drug exposure similar to that in adults receiving the standard TPV/r dose. Population PKanalysis demonstrated that TPV clearance can be affected by body weight and that volume of distribution canbe affected by age. 4Based on these studies, the final dose of TPV/r 375/150 mg/m2body surface area twice daily is recommended. ToxicityAdverse effects were similar between treatment groups in the multicenter, pediatric study. 2Twenty-five percent of children experienced a drug-related serious adverse event (AE), and 9% of patients discontinued study drugs because of AEs. The most common AEs were gastrointestinal disturbances; 37% of participantshad vomiting and 24% had diarrhea. Moderate or severe laboratory toxicity (primarily increase in gammaglutamyl transpeptidase and creatine phosphokinase) was seen in 11% of children. In the long-term follow-up report for PACTG 1051, incidence of AEs defined as drug-related was 55% to 65% regardless of age atentry, with higher discontinuation rates due to AEs in the older age groups. 3 Vitamin E is an excipient in the TPV oral solution, with a concentration of 116 IU of vitamin E and 100 mgtipranavir/mL of solution. The recommended dose of TPV (14 mg/kg body weight) results in a vitamin EGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-106dose of 16 IU/kg body weight per day, significantly higher than the reference daily intake for vitamin E (10 IU) and close to the upper limit of tolerability for children. In PACTG 1051, bleeding events were reportedmore commonly in children receiving TPV oral capsules (14.3%) than in children taking TPV oral solution(5.75%). 2Overall, the incidence of bleeding episodes (primarily epistaxis) in pediatric patients observed in clinical trials was 7.5%.5 References 1.

Increased rate of bacterial pneumonia (unclear association) Hypersensitivity reaction (HSR)\u2014symptoms m ay include rash, fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, rigors, hypotension, or elevated serum transaminases. Rechallenge is not r ecommended . Special Instructions Carefully instruct patient or caregiver in proper technique for drug reconstitution andadministration of SQ injections. Enfuvirtideinjection instructions are provided withconvenience kits. Allow reconstituted vial to stand until the powder goes completely into solution, whichcould take up to 45 minutes. Do not shake. Once reconstituted, inject enfuvirtide immediately or keep refrigerated in theoriginal vial until use. Reconstitutedenfuvirtide must be used within 24 hours. Enfuvirtide must be given SQ; severity of reactions increases if given intramuscularly. Give each injection at a site different from the preceding injection site; do not inject intomoles, scar tissue, bruises, or the navel. Boththe patient/caregiver and health care providershould carefully monitor for signs andsymptoms of local infection or cellulitis.

Reconstitution with 1.1 mL sterile water will deliver 90 mg/mL. Convenience Kit: 60 single-use vials of enfuvirtide (90-mg strength), vials of sterile water for injection, 60 reconstitution syringes (3 mL), 60 administration syringes (1 mL), alcohol wipesGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-109to better disperse the dose. There are reports of injection-associated neuralgia andparesthesia when alternative deliverysystems, such as needle-free injectiondevices, are used. Advise patients/caregivers of the possibility of a HSR; instruct them to discontinue treatmentand seek immediate medical attention if apatient develops signs and symptomsconsistent with a HSR. Metabolism Catabolism to constituent amino acids. Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) There are no known significant drug interactions with enfuvirtide. Major Toxicities More common:Almost all patients (87% to 98%) experience local injection site reactions including pain and discomfort, induration, erythema, nodules and cysts, pruritus, and ecchymosis. Reactions are usuallymild to moderate in severity but can be more severe. Average duration of local injection site reaction is 3to 7 days, but was >7 days in 24% of patients. Less common (more severe): Increased rate of bacterial pneumonia (unclear association). 1Pediatric studies have lacked the statistical power to answer questions concerning enfuvirtide use and increasedrisk of pneumonia. Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) (<1%) including fever, nausea and vomiting, chills, rigors, hypotension, and elevated liver transaminases; immune-mediated reactions including primary immunecomplex reaction, respiratory distress, glomerulonephritis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patientsexperiencing HSRs should seek immediate medical attention. Therapy should not be restarted in patientswith signs and symptoms consistent with HSRs. Pediatric specific: Local site cellulitis requiring antimicrobial therapy (up to 11% in certain subgroups of patients in pediatric studies). 2 Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf) and the Stanford University HIV DrugResistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use Approval Although enfuvirtide is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children, it is not commonly used because of its high cost, need for twice-daily subcutaneous (SQ) injections, and high rate ofinjection site reactions. Use in deep salvage regimens 3has also declined with the availability of integrase inhibitors and other entry inhibitors (such as maraviroc).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-110Pharmacokinetics A single-dose pharmacokinetic evaluation study of enfuvirtide, given SQ to 14 HIV-infected children aged 4 to 12 years (PACTG 1005), identified that enfuvirtide 60 mg/m2of body surface area per dose resulted in a target trough concentration that approximated the \"equivalent\" of a 90-mg dose delivered SQ to an adult(1000 mg/mL). 4In a second pediatric study of 25 children aged 5 to 16 years, a 2-mg/kg dose (maximum 90 mg) of enfuvirtide given twice daily yielded drug concentrations similar to 60 mg/m2of body surface area dose independent of age group, body weight, body surface area, and sexual maturation.5The FDA- recommended dose of enfuvirtide for children aged 6 to 16 years is 2 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) administeredSQ twice daily. Further data are needed for dosing in children aged <6 years. Efficacy The safety and antiretroviral (ARV) activity of twice-daily SQ enfuvirtide administration at 60 mg/m 2per dose plus optimized background therapy (OBT) was evaluated over 96 weeks in 14 children aged 4 to 12 years who had failed to achieve viral suppression on multiple prior ARV regimens (PACTG 1005). At 24weeks 71% of the children >1.0 logreduction in viral load; 43% and 21% had levels suppressed to <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL, respectively. However, only 36% of children maintainedvirologic suppression (>1.0 logdecrease in HIV RNA) at Week 96. Most children had local injection site reactions.6Significant improvements in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) percentages and height zscores were observed in children receiving enfuvirtide for 48 and 96 weeks. T20-310, a Phase I/II study of enfuvirtide (2.0 mg/kg SQ, maximum 90 mg, twice daily) plus OBT, enrolled 52 treatment-experienced children aged 3 to 16 years for 48 weeks. Only 64% of the children completed 48weeks of therapy. The median decrease in HIV RNA was -1.17 log 10copies/mL (n = 32) and increase in CD4 count was 106 cells/mm3(n = 25). At Week 8, treatment responses as measured by several plasma HIV RNA parameters were superior in younger children (aged <11 years) compared with adolescents. Medianincreases in CD4 cell count were 257 cells/mm 3in children and 84 cells/mm3in adolescents. Local skin reactions were common in all age groups (87% of study participants). The observed differential responsesbetween children and adolescents probably reflect unique challenges to adherence with the prescribedregimen. 2 References 1.

A pediatric clinical trial is under way.Selected Adverse Events Abdominal pain Cough Dizziness M usculoskeletal symptoms Fever Rash Upper respiratory tract infections Hepatotoxicity (which may be preceded by severe rash and/or other signs of systemic aller gic reaction) O rthostatic hypotension (especially in patients with severe renal insufficiency) Special Instructions Conduct testing with HIV tropism assay (see An tiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing in the main body of the guidelines) before usingmaraviroc to exclude the presence of CXCR4-using or mixed/dual-tropic HIV. Use maraviroc inpatients with only CCR5-tropic virus. Do not useif CXCR4 or mixed/dual-tropic HIV is present. Maraviroc can be given without regard to food. Instruct patients on how to recognize symptoms of allergic reactions or hepatitis. Use caution when administering maraviroc to patients with underlying cardiac disease . Metabolism Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate Dosing of maraviroc in patients with hepatic impairment : Use caution when administering maraviroc to patients with hepatic impairment.

Dosing of maraviroc in patients with renal impairment : Refer to the manufacturer's prescribing information. Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Absorption: Absorption of maraviroc is somewhat reduced with ingestion of a high-fat meal; however, maraviroc can be given with or without food. Metabolism: Maraviroc is a CYP3A4 and p-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate and requires dosage adjustments when administered with CYP- or Pgp-modulating medications. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with maraviroc. Major Toxicities More common: Cough, fever, upper respiratory tract infections, rash, musculoskeletal symptoms, abdominal pain, and dizziness. Less common (more severe): Hepatotoxicity that may be preceded by evidence of a systemic allergic reaction (such as pruritic rash, eosinophilia or elevated immunoglobulin) has been reported. Serious adverse events occurred in fewer than 2% of maraviroc-treated adult patients and included cardiovascularabnormalities (e.g., rhabdomyolysis. Resistance The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ). Clinical failure may also represent the outgrowth of CXCR4-using (naturally resistant) HIV variants. Pediatric UseThe pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of maraviroc in patients aged <16 years have not been established. A dose-finding and efficacy study is under way in children ages 2 to 17 years. 1,2In this trial, maraviroc dose is based upon body surface area and the presence or absence of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor inthe background regimen. Preliminary PK data are encouraging in those on a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, butlow exposures were seen in those not on a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Follow up with participants in this trialcontinues.

Use dolutegravir with caution in INSTI- experienced patients with severe renalimpairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) because dolutegravir concentrations willbe decreased (the cause of this decrease isunknown). Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Metabolism: Dolutegravir is a UGT1A1 and CYP 3A substrate and may require dosage adjustments when administered with UGT1A1 or CYP 3A-modulating medications. Because etravirine significantly reduces plasma concentrations of dolutegravir, dolutegravir should not be administered with etravirinewithout co-administration or lopinavir/ritonavir, whichcounteracts this dolutegravir concentrations. Dolutegravir should not be administered withnevirapine because of insufficient data. Before dolutegravir is administered, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities More common: Insomnia and headache Less common (more severe): Hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction.

At 24 weeks and 48 weeks, 70% and 61% had achieved HIV RNA concentration <50copies/mL, respectively. 2,3No safety or tolerability concerns were identified.2In addition, children aged 6 to <12 years are undergoing PK and longer-term follow up in P1093, using investigational tablets of lowerstrengths (or the 50-mg tablet if they weigh at least 40 kg). To date, data from 11 participants havedemonstrated a favorable safety profile, adequate PK, and virologic efficacy through 24 weeks. 4An oral pediatric granule formulation will also be studied.

Pediatric Dose (Aged <18 Years): Not Food and Drug Administration-approved f or use in children aged <18 years. EVG (as Vitekta) should not be used in a multi-pill r egimen with a boosted PI in this age group (see text). Preliminary data from an ongoing clinical trial suggest the adult formulation ofEV G in Stribild may be appropriate for use in youth aged 12 years and body weight 35 kg. Adult Dose (Aged 18 Years): EVG (as Vitekta) must be used in combination with an HIV PI co-administered with ritonavirand another antiretroviral (ARV) drug.

Special Instructions Administer with food. When used in combination with TDF, monitor estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein at baseline and every 3 to 6months while on therapy; in patients at risk ofrenal impairment, also monitor serumphosphate. Patients with increase in serumcreatinine >0.4 mg/dL should be closelymonitored for renal safety. Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before use of FTC or TDF. Severeacute exacerbation therefore,monitor hepatic function for several monthsafter therapy with FTC or TDF is stopped. Do not use EVG with PIs co-administered with cobicistat (not yet studied), or with otherEVG-containing drugs including Stribild.Stribild is not recommended for use withother ARV drugs. Metabolism EVG is metabolized by cytochrome P (CYP) 450 3A4 and is a modest inducer of CYP2C9. EVG should only be used with a PK enhancer (boosting agent) such as ritonavir as part PI-containing regimen or incombination with cobicistat (in Stribild).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-118Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Metabolism: P (CYP) 3A4 and is a modest inducer of CYP2C9. Cobicistat is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and weak of CYP2D6; in addition, cobicistat inhibits ATP-dependent transporters the transporting polypeptides OAT1B1 and OAT1B3. Potential exists formultiple drug interactions when using cobicistat. Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function or compete for active tubular secretion could reduce clearance of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) or emtricitabine. Concomitant use avoided when using Stribild. Protease inhibitors: Stribild should not be administered concurrent with products or regimens containing ritonavir because of similar effects of cobicistat and ritonavir on CYP3A metabolism. Cobicistat andritonavir are not interchangeable, and when administered with either atazanavir or darunavir, may resultin different drug interactions when used with other concomitant medications. Stribild is not recommended for use with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, diarrhea, and flatulence Less common (more severe): Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) including tenofovir and emtricitabine. Tenofovir caused bone toxicity (osteomalacia and reduced bone density) in animalswhen given in high doses. Decreases in bone mineral density have been reported in both adults andchildren taking tenofovir; the clinical significance of these changes is not yet known. Evidence of renaltoxicity, including increases in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glycosuria, proteinuria,phosphaturia, and/or calciuria and decreases in serum phosphate, has been observed with tenofovir.Numerous case reports of renal tubular dysfunction have been reported in patients receiving tenofovir;patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction should be closely monitored if treated with Stribild. Resistance The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). There is phenotypic cross-resistance Stribild (EVG + COBI + FTC + TDF): Adult dose (aged 18 years ): 1 tablet once daily in ARV treatment-naive adults Stribild should not be initiated in patients with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) <70mL/min and should be discontinued inpatients with CrCl <50 mL/minbecause dose adjustments required for FTCand TDF cannot be achieved with a fixed-dosecombination tablet. Stribild should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-119Pediatric Use Approval Elvitegravir was Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved in 2014 as a tablet for use adults in combination with an HIV protease inhibitor (PI) plus ritonavir and was FDA-approved in 2012 for use inadults as the fixed-dose combination Stribild, elvitegravir is FDA-approved use in children aged <18 years. 2 Formulations Elvitegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor that is metabolized rapidly by CYP3A4. Elvitegravir must be used in combination with an HIV PI co-administered with ritonavir and another ARV drug, or in thefixed-dose combination product Stribild, 3which contains cobicistat (see below). Cobicistat itself does not have ARV activity, but is a CYP3A4 inhibitor that acts as and allow once-daily administration of elvitegravir when used in approved doses and combinations. Note that the dose of elvitegravir is differentwhen used with ritonavir plus atazanavir or lopinavir compared to its use with different PIs plus ritonavir, orcompared to its use with cobicistat as a component of Stribild. Complex or unknown mechanisms of druginteractions between cobicistat or ritonavir with elvitegravir and PIs may result in different drug interactionswhen used with other medications. 4 Stribild is FDA-approved as a complete ARV regimen in HIV-1-infected ARV-naive adults aged 18 years.3 Trials have shown non-inferiority of creatinine, and serum creatinine will often increase soon after initiation of treatment withStribild. Therefore, creatinine-based calculations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will bealtered, even though the actual GFR might be only minimally changed. 9Adults who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine greater than 0.4 mg/dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renaltoxicity by following creatinine for further increases and urinalysis for evidence of proteinuria or glycosuria. 3 Because tenofovir is included in Stribild and can be associated with renal toxicity, careful periodic evaluationof renal function is warranted. This nephrotoxicity may be more pronounced in patients with pre-existingrenal disease. 3 Use in Adolescents Aged 12 to 18 Years A PK study of the adult dose of elvitegravir as Vitekta in 25 youth aged 12 to 18 years showed plasma concentrations similar to those in adults when given in regimens that included darunavir/ritonavir,fosamprenavir/ritonavir, or atazanavir/ritonavir in addition to NRTIs. However, this was a multi-pill regimenand medication adherence was poor during the 48-week treatment phase of the study. Data were insufficientto establish safety and effectiveness of elvitegravir as Vitekta in this age group. Therefore, elvitegravir asVitekta was not FDA-approved for use in this age group, and is not generally recommended by the Panel. A PK study of the adult dosage formulation of EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF in 14 HIV-infected youth median age 16 years (range 13-17 years) and weight 57 kg (range 35-80 kg) suggested that elvitegravir drug exposures in adolescents were similar to those in adults.10Preliminary week 24 results in 20 patients from a safety and efficacy study in South Africa, the United States, and Thailand, median age 16 years (range 12-17 years) and weight 55 kg (range 35-82 kg) suggested safety and efficacy similar to that seen in adult trials.11This study is ongoing, with a planned enrollment of 36 participants and duration of 48 weeks to more fully characterize useof EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF in youth aged 12 to 18 years ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01721109 ). Use in Children Younger Than 12 Early bioequivalence data of pediatric formulations of both elvitegravir12and cobicistat13support progression to Phase II/III studies in children, which are underway.

Note: Maximum dose of chewable tablets is 300 mg twice daily. Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Metabolism: The major route of raltegravir by rifampin tipranavir may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir, whereas inhibitors of UGT1A1 such as atazanavir may increase plasma concentrations of raltegravir. In adults, an increased dose of raltegravir is recommended when co-administered with rifampin. The appropriate dose adjustment is not known in children. Efavirenz and etravirine may decrease raltegravir concentrations. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with raltegravir. Raltegravir plasma concentrations may be reduced when administered with antacids containing divalent metal cations such as magnesium hydroxide, aluminum or calcium carbonate: o Co-administration or administration of raltegravir within 6 hours of aluminum and/or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids resulted in significantly reduced raltegravir plasma levels and is not recommended. o Calcium carbonate decreased raltegravir plasma concentrations to a lesser extent, thus no dose adjustment is recommended with calcium-containing antacids. Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, itching, and insomnia Less common: Abdominal pain, vomiting. Patients with chronic active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C are more likely to experience worsening aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin than are patients who are not coinfected. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-123 Rare: Moderate to severe increase in creatine phosphokinase. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: Use raltegravir with caution in patients receiving medications associated with these toxicities. Anxiety, depression, and paranoia especially in those with prior history. Rash including Stevens-Johnsonsyndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been Hepatic failure (with and without associated hypersensitivity) inpatients with underlying liver disease and/or concomitant medications. Resistance The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use ApprovalRaltegravir is Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in infants and children aged 4 weeks and weight 3 kg. Current pediatric approval and dosing recommendations are based upon evaluations in 122patients aged 4 weeks to 18 years enrolled in IMPAACT P1066. 1 Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics Children Aged 2 to 18 Years IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open-label multicenter study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of various formulations of raltegravir in combination antiretroviral treatment (cAR T)-experienced, HIV-infected children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years in combination with an optimized background cART regimen.2,3Subjects receive either the 400-mg, film-coated tablet formulation twice daily (patients aged 6-18 years and weighing at least 25 kg) or the chewable tablet formulation at a doseof 6 mg/kg twice daily (aged 2 to <12 years). In IMP AACT P1066, the initial dose-finding stage includes intensive PK evaluation in various age cohorts (aged 12 to <19 years, 6 to <12 years, 2 to <6 years). Dose selection is based on achieving target PK parameters similar to those seen in adults: PK targets are geometricmean (GM) area under the curve of 14-25 \u00b5Mxh and GM 12-hour concentration >33 nM. Additional subjects are then enrolled in each age cohort to evaluate long-term efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Ninety-three (97%)subjects completed 24 weeks of treatment with 54% achieving HIV RNA <50 copies/mL with a mean CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count (percent [%]) increase of 119 cells/mm3(3.8%). Ninety-one subjects completed 48 weeks of treatment with 57% achieving HIV RNA <50 copies/mL with a mean CD4 count (percent [%])increase of 156 cells/mm 3(4.6%).2In subjects who experienced virologic failure, development of drug resistance and/or poor adherence were contributing factors. The frequency, type, and severity of drug-relatedadverse reactions through week 48 were comparable to those observed in adult studies. Observed adversereactions considered drug-related included one patient with grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormalbehavior, and insomnia; one patient with a grade 2 allergic rash; and one patient with grade 3 ALT and grade 4AST laboratory elevations. There were no discontinuations due to adverse events and no drug-related deaths. In 19 HIV-infected children and adolescents with multidrug-resistant virus in the HIV Spanish Pediatric Cohort (CoRISe), good virologic response and improved CD4 counts were observed when raltegravir was included in an optimized regimen.4Additional experience from the French expanded access program in treatment- experienced adolescents supports the good virologic and immunologic results observed in IMPAACT P1066.5,6 Infants/Toddlers Aged at Least 4 Weeks to <2 Years IMPAACT P1066 studied 26 infants and toddlers aged 4 weeks to <2 years who were administered the oral suspension in combination with an optimized background regimen. All subjects had received priorantiretrovirals as part of prevention of perinatal transmission and/or treatment of HIV infection, and 69% hadbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA exceeding 100,000 copies/mL. Twenty-three (88%) completed 48 weeks oftreatment with 44% achieving HIV RNA <50 copies/mL with a mean CD4 count (percent [%]) increase of 492cells/mm 3(7.8%).1PK parameters were similar to those achieved for the older cohorts in IMPAACT P1066.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-124Neonates Aged <4 Weeks There are no data on the safety and dosing of raltegravir in neonates aged <4 weeks. Raltegravir is metabolized by UGT1A1, the same enzyme responsible for the elimination of bilirubin. UGT enzyme activityis low at birth, and it is likely that raltegravir elimination is prolonged in neonates. In addition, bilirubin andraltegravir may compete for UGT and binding sites. Washout PK of raltegravir in neonates born to HIV-infected pregnant women was studied in P1097.8The neonatal plasma half-life was highly variable, ranging from 9.3 to 184 hours, suggesting potential roles for developmental aspects of neonatal UGT1A1 P1110 is a Phase I trial that will evaluate the safety and PK of raltegravir in HIV-1 exposed neonates at high risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01780831). Formulations The PK of raltegravir was compared in HIV-infected adult patients receiving intact, whole 400-mg tablets and patients who chewed the 400-mg film-coated tablets because of swallowing difficulties. Drug absorption wassignificantly higher in the group who chewed the tablets, although palatability was rated as poor. 9 The raltegravir chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability than the film-coated tabletbased on a comparative study in healthy adult volunteers. 10Inter-patient and intra-patient variability for PK parameters of raltegravir are considerable, especially with the film-coated tablets.1,11Because of the differences in the bioavailability of the chewable tablets, film-coated tablets, and oral suspension, the dosingrecommendations are different and these products are not interchangeable .

Pediatric Dosing (Aged <18 Years): Not approved for use in children aged <18 years Adolescent (Aged 18 Years)/Adult Dosing: Cobicistat must either be administered as the combination tablet Stribild, in which case itwould not be dosed with any other anti-retrovirals (ARVs), or be co-administered withatazanavir or darunavir at the doses listed inthe table below, at the same time, or incombination tablets with atazanavir (Evotaz) ordarunavir (Prezcobix), with food, and Adverse Events When co-administered with TDF, cobicistat may be associated with higher risk of renaltubular adverse events than ritonavir. Special Instructions Cobicistat is not interchangeable with ritonavir. Do not administer cobicistat with ritonavir or with drugs containing cobicistat (Stribild). Not recommended for use with more than one ARV that requires PK enhancement (e.g.,elvitegravir in combination with a PI) becauseno data are available. Use with PIs other than atazanavir 300 mg or darunavir 800 mg administered once daily isnot recommended because no data areavailable on other combinations or doses. Patients with a confirmed increase in serum creatinine >0.4 mg/dL from baseline shouldbe closely monitored for renal safety. When used in combinations with TDF, monitor serum creatinine, urine protein, and urineglucose at baseline and every 3 to 6 monthswhile on therapy (see Table 13i ). In patients at risk of renal impairment, also monitor serumphosphate.

Dosing of cobicistat in patients with renal impairment : Do not use cobicistat with TDF in patients with creatinine clearance below 70 mL/ min because of the potential need for dose adjustments of TDF if creatinine clearance dr ops below 50 mL/min. Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents and http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ) Metabolism: Cobicistat is inhibitor of of CYP2D6; in addition, cobicistat inhibits ATP-dependent transporters the organic anion transporting polypeptides OAT1B1 and OAT1B3. The potential exists for multiple drug interactionswhen using cobicistat. Before cobicistat is administered, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential interactions and overlapping toxicities with other drugs. Cobicistat and ritonavir are not interchangeable, and administration with either atazanavir or darunavir may result in different drug interactions when used with other concomitant medications. Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia Less common (more severe): New onset or worsening of renal impairment when used with TDF. Rhabdomyolysis; increased amylase and lipase. Resistance Not applicable: cobicistat has no antiviral activity. Its sole use is as a PK enhancer of ARVs. Pediatric Use ApprovalCobicistat has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for use in individuals 18 years or older. It is not approved for use in children. 1 References 1.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-128Ritonavir (RTV, Norvir) (Last updated March 5, 2015; last reviewed March 5, 2015) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Oral Solution (Contains 43% Alcohol by Volume): 80 mg/mL Capsules: 100 mg as a PK enhancer protease inhibitors (PIs) and of an inhibitor (elvitegravir) when elvitegravir isincluded in a boosted protease-containingregimen. The recommended dose of ritonavirvaries and is specific to the drug combinationselected. See dosing information for specificPIs and for elvitegravir. * Ritonavir has antiretroviral activity but is no longer recommended for use as an antiviralagent (see text).Selected Adverse Events Gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Paresthesia (circumoral and extremities) Hyperlipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia Hepatitis Asthenia Taste perversion Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens- Johnson syndrome Special Instructions Administer ritonavir with food to increase absorption and reduce GI adverse effects. Do not administer ritonavir with cobicistat or drugs that contain cobicistat (Stribild). If ritonavir is prescribed with didanosine, administer the drugs 2 hours apart. Refrigerate ritonavir capsules only if the capsules will not be used within 30 days orcannot be stored below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Ritonavirtablets are heat stable. Do not refrigerate ritonavir oral solution; store at room temperature (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F or 20\u00b0C to25\u00b0C). Shake the solution well before use. Ritonavir oral solution has limited shelf life; use within 6 months. Patients who have persistent or significant nausea with the capsule may benefit fromswitching to the tablet. Also, the tablet is smallerthan the capsule and thus easier to swallow.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-129Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents andhttp://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf ) Metabolism: Ritonavir is extensively metabolized by and is one of the most potent inhibitors of hepatic cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). There is potential for multiple drug interactions with ritonavir. Before ritonavir is administered, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential interactions with ritonavir and overlapping toxicities with other drugs. Ritonavir and cobicistat are not interchangeable and may result in different drug interactions. Avoid concomitant use of intranasal or inhaled fluticasone because of reports of adrenal insufficiency.1 Use caution when prescribing ritonavir with other inhaled steroids; limited data suggest that beclomethasone may be a suitable alternative to fluticasone when an inhaled/intranasal corticosteroid isrequired for a patient who is taking ritonavir. 2,3 Major Toxicities More common: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, anorexia, circumoral paresthesia, lipid abnormalities Less common (more severe): Exacerbation of hyperglycemia, bleeding in hemophiliacs, pancreatitis, and hepatitis (life-threatening in rare cases). Allergic bronchospasm, urticaria, and angioedema. Toxic epidermal necrolysis andStevens-Johnson syndrome have occurred. 4 To Increase Tolerability of Ritonavir Oral Solution in Children : Mix solution with milk, chocolate milk, or vanilla or chocolate pudding or ice cream. Before administration, give a child ice chips, a Popsicle, or spoonfuls of partially frozen orange or grape juice concentrate todull the taste buds, or give peanut butter tocoat the mouth. After administration, give a child strong- tasting foods such as maple syrup or cheese. Check food allergy history before making these recommendations. Metabolism Cytochrome P with hepatic impairment : Ritonavir is primarily metabolized by the liver. No dosage adjustment isnecessary in patients with mild or moderatehepatic impairment. Data are unavailable onritonavir dosing for adult or pediatric patientswith severe hepatic cautionwhen administering ritonavir to patients withmoderate-to-severe hepatic impairment.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection P-130Resistance Resistance to ritonavir is not clinically relevant when the drug is used as a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer of other antiretroviral (ARV) medications. Pediatric Use ApprovalRitonavir has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the pediatric population. Efficacy: Effectiveness in Practice Use of ritonavir as the sole protease inhibitor (PI) in combination antiretroviral therapy in children is not recommended. Although ritonavir has been well studied in children as an ARV agent, it is no longer used as asole PI for therapy because ritonavir is associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity and hasa greater potential for drug-drug interactions than other PIs. Also, ritonavir as a sole PI was associated with ahigher risk of virologic failure than efavirenz or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, and children who developedvirologic failure while receiving ritonavir as a sole PI had a high prevalence of major PI and multiclassmutations. 5-9In addition, poor palatability of the liquid preparation and large pill burden with the capsules (adult dose is six capsules or tablets twice daily) limit its use as a sole PI. Concentrations are highly variablein children younger than 2 years, and doses of 350 to 450 mg/m 2twice daily may not be sufficient for long- term suppression of viral replication in this age group.10-18However, in both children and adults, ritonavir is recommended as a PK enhancer for use with other PIs or, in adults, with the integrase inhibitor elvitegravirwhen used in combination with another PI. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor and functions as a PK enhancerby slowing the metabolism of elvitegravir and of the Pediatric dosing regimens including boosted fosamprenavir, a PI co- formulation, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, are available (see individual PIs for more specific information).Dosing of ritonavir when used as a PK enhancer of elvitegravir in a boosted PI regimen is available foradults (see elvitegravir section). Toxicity Full-dose ritonavir has been shown to prolong the PR interval in a study of healthy adults who were given ritonavir at 400 mg twice daily.4Potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in premature newborn infants treated with ritonavir-boosted have been reported; thus, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir should not beused in this group of patients. 19,20Co-administration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (e.g., macrolides, quinolones, methadone) should be undertaken with caution because it is unknown how co-administering any of these drugs with ritonavir will affect the PR interval. In addition, ritonavir should beused with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of developing cardiac conduction abnormalities,such as those with underlying structural heart disease, conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heartdisease, or cardiomyopathy.
