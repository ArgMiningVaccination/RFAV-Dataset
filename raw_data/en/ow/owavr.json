I would fly all the way across the world to visit Nicola. I have been going to her for massages and Ayurvedic treatments for over five years now. She holds the best space and creates an amazing experience. I first found her by chance but she has changed my entire life with holistic wellness, spiritual healing and virtual therapy sessions. I recently had the opportunity to stay in the beautiful Bonny Doon for Pancha Karma and it was life changing. I left glowing inside and out. Words can't describe how grateful I am for that time. It was worth the investment. If you are struggling with burn out from work, the pandemic or life, Nicola always has the perfect remedy to help you find yourself again. If you are looking for your fire, energy, heart, confidence and passion again, trust Nicola. She will always be there with the utmost care and attention. I can't thank her enough for everything she has done for me and my family. We have so much love and appreciation.\" -Sarah Cowen, Michigan \"Two weeks ago was my birthday and to celebrate I had an Ayurvedic massage session with [Nicola Turner](https://www.facebook.com/nicola.brigham.3?__cft__[0]=AZWjbYhvxYB2fPFwz4WBOj2MKVcA9Et4FPsm0BHMsg1WiahF8MjG50q8Reu4uLC38R_Rbw1WRgBLjRvOQ0d2n1IFkVdP99TZBWABijpAaT4qqSqUuKlzU_nnrEvSkcvt5XU&__tn__=-]K-R), since that session I have been processing the transformation and integration of what she facilitated. Nicola is a tremendous healer and force. Thank you! What I noticed in the session: I was heard, I was felt, I was touched, And I was purified. I am being transformed. This cleansing seems to have created an arc that continues. I cried for hours releasing old grief. I am sure there is more. A shout out to all those who live near Santa Cruz area, the next time you feel the need to heal, consider visiting Nicola. The Ancient wood fairie healer. Said with great respect and love.\" -Vee \"I came to Nicola for the PK Kleanse. I had been struggling with allergies, sinus infections and a lung infection since last February. Having tried the western medicine route and other eastern modalities, this process was my last hope. I wanted a reset for my mind-body and spirit. Post cleanse my lungs and nasal passages are no longer congested. My body feels awake, light and clean. My mental attitude is clear, sense of humor is back and my irritability is gone. Forever grateful for taking the PK Plunge. Nicola is a master practitioner. The body work and cleansing process she takes you through would cost a fortune at a retreat or resort.\" Jan Brogan \"I want to thank you again for giving me the tools I needed to pry away the layers upon layers of obscurity that had clouded my essence. For the first time in so many years I have clarity. Not only a physical clarity showing through my skin, digestion, and eyes, but more importantly, a mental clarity, that I haven't felt in so many years. Your Pancha Karma treatment has awakened my vitality, my health, and my life! It gave me back the control of my own health and the confidence to know that I have all the tools I need to find balance within myself. The mental space it gave me has allowed me to see the world and my day to day in a completely different perspective. It has been truly liberating! Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for existing and doing what you do! Your dedication to the practice, to your treatments, to your patients is like none I have ever experienced. You are truly an amazing soul! Your Pancha Karma treatment has truly shifted my life to a path of clarity and peace. Forever grateful for your great work.\" -Carla Dawson \"Making the decision to do Pancha Karma with Nicola was life changing. The amount of care and attention Nicola provided was sensational. She truly puts her whole heart into my personal healing journey, not only providing top-notch Ayurvedic care but beautiful life coaching as well. Each morning she gave me time to simply speak what was coming up for me. This is where her study as a yoga teacher really comes through. She is not just a healer of the body, but of the heart. Choosing to undergo PK was worth every last cent. It not only rejuvenated my body, mind, and spirit, but gave me an invaluable understanding of my body. At the end of the PK journey, I had an awakened awareness of my body and mind according to ayurvedic principals. No study in a book could have given me this level of understanding. Nicola understands this better than anyone, and she helped me understand what was happening so I had tools to take beyond the PK experience. By the end of PK my eyes were sparkling and clear. I stared at them in the mirror and couldn't believe it. I've never seen my eyes look so beautiful. The skin on my face was rehydrated and glowing. Seriously, my face looked as though I had the most amazing beauty sleep on the planet. My digestion was incredibly regular and I could see and feel the bloating I carried had subsided. I felt better than I've ever felt. Upon returning home I informed my family \"I feel like I have a new body!\" -Nicolette Johnson \"I love having Nicola on my healing team. Her body work is a necessity for good living. Every massage has been delightful and empowering. Movement not only in physical improvement, but emotions as well. I also took the opportunity to do her ayuvedic cleanse in October and that was the best experience I've ever had. Not only did I loose inches around my waist, but my digestion also improved dramatically. Looking forward to my monthly massages in 2016 with this professional and lovely human being.\" -Nicole Sallak Anderson \"Cannot say enough about her healing hands in ayurveda massage and the cupping, well, that was intense and definitely brought up a lot that needed to heal. Thank you my friend, well done!\" -Denise Kirpal Lapides \"Nicola gives the best abhyangas in town. She is very generous with her oil application and has a skilled and intuitive touch.\" -Honora Bacon \"The ayurvedic consultation today blew me away. I thought this would be a few questions and some kind of rule book of \"what to eat and what not to,\" and it was so much more. The depth of Nicola's knowledge of the subject, her sensitivity, capacity for listening and seeing is really inspiring. As I step into my own role as a healer, I look to healers like Nicola to show me how to be present to a client's needs. Thank you so much, Nicola for being a wonderful, glowing presence and making me so comfortable. I am looking forward to changing my nutritional habits and sending you clients when friends ask me how I healed my life.\" -Lionsmiles Inman \"Nicola is amazing! I arrived and she sat me down and asked me about my health and how I was feeling. She gave me some products and natural remedies that have really helped me, and then gave me the most amazing massage. I would HIGHLY recommend her!\" -Lesley Gustavson Kite \"Nicola provided top-notch care and advice on diet changes and supplements that changed my life. Her whole body knowledge really revolutionizes typical care you might receive. And interesting, the ayurvedic medicine and diet follows a lot of the foods that I would find as comfort as a kid to feel better from allergies. I only wish I would have known about ayurvedic medicine sooner. I am so thankful for Nicola!\" -Andrea Joy Vander Woude \"Seriously excellent, present, gifted and generous. Nicola is a body psychic while being completely down to earth. Getting bodywork from Nicola is a journey and it always leads to somewhere better than I was feeling when I came in. I'm so grateful for her talent and attention to my physical details.\" -Megan McElroy \"My husband and I have had several great massages from Nicola. She has strong hands and knows how to get those muscles loosened. She is also totally professional and respectful. Highly recommend her!\" -Julia Gaudinski \"Love Her! Felt sooo much better after seeing Nicola . And her overall knowledge on Ayurveda helped me out a lot!\" -Angela Sohl \"My highest regards to this "}
