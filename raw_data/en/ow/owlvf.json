Boosting immunity doesn't mean an actual increase in the production of immune cells, because the human body has the capacity to continually produce the immune cells and the unwanted extra cells are removed from the blood stream if there is no use. The main aim of these immune boosters should be to induce the body to produce healthy immune cells that can actively find the target cells and fight the infections effectively. Best homeopathic medicines to improve the immune system The immune system consists of special organs, cells and chemicals which help to fight the infections. They are the white blood cells, antibodies, the complement system, the lymphatic system, the spleen, the thymus, and the bone marrow. The organs such as bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen and thymus produce the lymphocytes. The lymphocytes are the white blood cells which are further classified into B and T cells. They attack and destroy the invading microorganisms or antigens. B cells retaliate by releasing antibodies specific to the antigen and the T cells destroys and kill the foreign invaders and abnormal cells. There are three types of immunity in human beings. They are: Innate immunity: which all the human beings are born with. The innate immunity begins to act against the invading germs from birth such as the skin and mucous membranes of the throat. Adaptive immunity: which human beings develop throughout their lives as they are exposed to various diseases and pathogens. Passive immunity: also called \"borrowed\" or temporary immunity is obtained from other outer sources and it lasts for a short time.
