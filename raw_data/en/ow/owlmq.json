Help protect 30 percent of the planet by 2030.", "sitename": "Campaign For Nature", "date": "2023-08-31", "cleaned_text": "The planet is in crisis and our future is at stake. The natural world is disappearing at an unprecedented rate. The loss of nature poses a grave threat to our clean air and drinking water, the survival of wildlife, the prosperity of communities, and nature's ability to protect us from natural disasters, future pandemics, and other intensifying impacts of climate change. The twin crises of climate change and the rapid loss of biodiversity threatens the very existence of humanity on Earth. But only if we fail to act. If we act now, we can still secure a better future for the planet, its wildlife and ourselves. That's why we have created the Campaign for Nature. Campaign for Nature is calling on world leaders to: Deliver on their commitment to protect at least 30% of the planet by 2030 Ensure $20 billion of international biodiversity funding is delivered by 2025 Approach biodiversity conservation in a way that fully integrates and respects the leadership and rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities \"This is the level of ambition we need because this is the last chance to secure a functional living planet for people and other forms of life.\" - Tom Lovejoy, Conservation biologist known as the \"Godfather of Biodiversity\" Get up to speed fast on 30x30: PRESS Get the latest news and information about the Campaign for Nature.
