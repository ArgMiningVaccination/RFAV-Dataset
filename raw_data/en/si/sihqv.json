Barbra Hudson, a former cosmetics industry executive in Burnaby, B.C., is one of them. Nearly 10 years ago, when her infant daughter was very ill with stomach problems, Ms. Hudson made a huge leap and decided to try to heal her baby herself, using unconventional methods. She started dabbling in Reiki, a healing therapy that is now one of several burgeoning alternative health treatments practised in Canada. Today, she's a practising Reiki master who teaches and certifies others. She's also president of the Canadian Reiki Association, a growing body with 400 members, or about one-quarter of the total number of practitioners in the country. Reiki masters help to rebalance people's energy systems and accelerate healing using gentle therapeutic touch. Over the past decade, Canadians have become more interested in health care that falls outside the realm of traditional Western medicine. A study conducted by the Fraser Institute in British Columbia in 1997 found that nearly three-quarters of respondents (73 per cent) had used a form of alternative therapy within the previous year, with chiropractic work, prayer, and relaxation and massage topping the list. Canadians also spent $1.8-billion in out-of-pocket visits to alternative medicine practitioners in 1997, a figure that leaps to $3.8-billion if you include the cost of related books, herbal remedies, vitamins and diet programs. \"It's risen from relative obscurity,\" says Sandy Powell, an aromatherapy and reflexology instructor based in Orillia, Ont., who helped set standard regulations for aromatherapy and reflexology as a member of the Canadian Examining Board in 1992. The board represents about 28 types of holistic therapies, including aromatherapy, reflexology and acupuncture. \"It's gone from when people would just glaze right over when you'd mention [holistic therapies]to now when many people know something about it. It's come that far in just 10 years,\" Ms. Powell says. Chiropractic work is a prime example of a regulated field that has come a long way from when it was considered quackery by the roughly 56,000 licensed physicians in the country. Chiropractors must earn a degree, pass a rigorous set of national standardized exams and be licensed by their provincial boards. Despite bad press from neck injury malpractice suits, the Canadian Chiropractic Association says the number of practising doctors has leaped to more than 6,000 this year, nearly double the number in 1993. Holistic therapists have been trying to attain official recognition for years, but chiropractors and massage therapists are the only two that are currently federally regulated. Naturopathic doctors are provincially regulated in British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The Ontario government also recently considered -- and decided against -- regulating acupuncturists. Holistic practitioners believe their field is becoming more popular because of a dramatic shift in people's health consciousness. \"Now that so much money is being pulled out of our health care system, especially in British Columbia, a lot of people are turning to alternative therapies because they have nothing to lose,\" Ms. Hudson says. \"There are a lot of aging baby boomers who can't get in to see their specialists.\" Some people are looking for a more personal connection with their medical practitioner as well, says Shawn O'Reilly, executive director of the Canadian Naturopathic Association in Toronto. The past few years have seen a significant increase in the number of people entering all areas of holistic alternative medicine, including aromatherapy, reflexology, acupuncture, Shiatsu, Reiki and herbology. Enrolment at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine in Toronto rose to 547 students this past year, from 72 students in 1992. The college offers Canada's only four-year full-time professional program in naturopathic medicine, defined as \"the art and science of disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention using natural therapies.\" Tuition costs about $15,000 a year. The college Web site recently listed more than 40 clinical practice opportunities for licensed naturopathic doctors across Canada. Like practising medical professionals, Ms. O'Reilly says salaries for naturopaths can range from $40,000 for recent graduates all the way up to $100,000 for seasoned doctors. But despite mounting interest in the holistic field, one major concern among practitioners is the lack of standardized procedures and licensing for each discipline. Variations can be found from province to province and even between municipalities. (In Ontario, most municipalities are adopting Toronto's blueprint for licensing requirements, which includes a certificate from an approved school and membership in a recognized association.) There are national associations for most major alternative therapies, including reflexology, Reiki, and homeopathy, but practitioners are not required to become members and standards set by these associations are simply guidelines for licensing boards to follow. There are no national organizations for such therapies as Shiatsu and therapeutic touch. Another concern for holistic practitioners seeking to push their trade into the mainstream is that alternative therapies are not covered under provincial health plans, although a number of company benefits plans and extended insurance packages are beginning to partly cover fees. While a decent wage can be earned as a holistic practitioner, sometimes people in the field are lacking enough business knowledge to make a go of it on their own, say Ms. Powell and Ms. Hudson, who urge alternative therapists take business courses to learn how to market themselves. \"It is important for people to know that it's a business and you do need that background, to promote it,\" Ms. Hudson says. Natural health practitioners often charge $40 to $100 an hour for a session, Ms. Powell says. They can often write off expenses if they work from home and are self-employed. Some holistic therapists are making very good money indeed. A former student of Ms. Powell's works seasonally from April to October at a resort in Muskoka and makes $80,000 to $90,000 during that period -- enough to take the winter months off. Other practitioners find full-time work at spas and holistic health clinics, many of which are expanding to accommodate the wave of public interest in such therapies. Despite its struggles, alternative therapies may be moving into the mainstream as battle lines between traditional medical doctors and holistic practitioners slowly dissolve. \"You're seeing more and more doctors who are recommending these therapies,\" Ms. Powell says. \"I have a lot of doctors who call me up and ask my opinion and I'm honoured. You're seeing a greying of these two sides and I "}
