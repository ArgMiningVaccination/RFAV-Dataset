He stayed there in active duty for 27 months and upon his return was clinically diagnosed with PTSD, depression and suicidal thoughts. As previously mentioned, he tried all allopathic and holistic healing modalities available such as (among others): Cognitive therapy: For suicidal people this was developed by Aaron Beck and Gregory Brown. Unlike other CBT treatments, this approach is not time limited. The third and last stage is \"relapse prevention with a Twist\", which involves inducing a suicidal crisis for the client while they are in session. The theory behind this technique draws from the fact that people who are suicidal have trouble using newly acquired skills when in crisis. By evoking the crisis in session, the client is able to apply and test coping skills with the therapist's help and support. Clients do not graduate from treatment until they demonstrate that they are ready to do this on their own. Dialectical behavior therapy: Developed by Marsha M Linehan, is designed to treat emotion regulation difficulties and suicidal behavior. One element, the skill-building component of DBT, addresses the issues of distress tolerance and the development of healthy affect regulation strategies, both of which are essential for suicidal clients. Mentalizing treatment: Developed by Jon Allen and Peter Fonagy, emphasizes emotional regulation and expressiveness. The techniques implemented assist clients in forming good affect regulation and tolerance through the process of developing the mentalizing capability to observe and understand their minds and the minds of others, accurately seeing the mind behind the behavior. Transference-focused therapy: Developed by Kernberg, Clarkin and Yeomans, concentrates on the intermediate interaction between the client and therapist in session by focusing on the therapeutic relationship. Voice therapy: Developed by Robert Firestone, is a cognitive-affective-behavioral therapeutic methodology that brings introjected hostile thoughts, with the accompanying negative affect, to consciousness, rendering them accessible for treatment? Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): A psychotherapy treatment that was originally designed to alleviate the distress associated with traumatic memories. Shapiro's adaptive information processing model posits that EMDR therapy facilitates the accessing and processing of traumatic memories and other adverse life experience to bring these to an adaptive resolution. Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT): An alternative therapy for fear, Thought Field Therapy (TFT), was developed by Roger Callahan. TFT is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine, claiming to access alleged meridians that carry the energy and well-being of animals, including humans. Callahan developed TFT while treating a patient for water phobia. The Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), developed by Gary Craig, evolved from TFT. Craig claims that EFT takes TFT a step further by using a comprehensive procedure, thus eliminating the need for a complicated diagnosis. Since none of these therapies helped, he opted for medications, which he decided to stop in 2012. He came to the conclusion that the drugs were more detrimental to his health than they were positive. Since then, he has been \"managing\" his illnesses by himself by struggling daily to stay alive and using all of his willpower to not commit suicide. On September 7th , 2017, he received a 90-minute Holographic Kinetics session. Three days after, he reported more than 50% improvement towards his suicidal and depression symptoms and a less than 50% improvement regarding his PTSD symptoms. Three weeks after the HK session, he became 100% free from all of his prior symptoms. Today, November 21st, 2017, he is still symptom free. The Holographic Kinetics protocol for treating suicidal patients is easily replicable once you have become an advanced and experienced HK practitioner. For military veterans, it is more complicated than normal and it requires advanced professional Holographic Kinetics. The patient, before and after treatment (4 days after, 4 weeks after and almost 5 months after), answered these Holographic Kinetics questions: Before a session; - What is affecting you that you would like to look at? - If you looked over your life what are the cycles that you see that are affecting you? - What do you react to? - Have you taken any drugs or drink excessively? - What is the main issue that you would like to clear? - Have you been in a war zone? - Do you have voices in the head? After a session next visit; - Do you still have voices in the head? - How do you feel since the session? - Are you still on drugs or alcohol? - How did the family find your attitude, before the session? - What does your family find your attitude since the session? - Is there anything else that is affecting you that you would like to look at? Below: These are based on psychology not Holographic Kinetics. I would remove as most is auto suggestion and dangerous and could have a worst effect on the patient. "}
