Thequality of Holy Basil is said to be 'sattvic' orpure. It opens the heart and mind, bestowingthe energy of love and devotion. It is said toalso strengthen faith, compassion and clarityas well as give protection of the divine byclearing the aura and strengthening theimmune system. Besides being grown formedicinal purposes, it is kept in the house forits purifying influence where it absorbs positive ions, energizes negative ions and liberates ozone from the sun's rays. It is usually found in a Hindu household and has aspecial place either in the courtyard or usedas part of an altar for meditation and worship. In the Christian tradition it is saidto have grown around the place of the crucifixion and it also appears in Shiite writings. There are other recognized types of Holy Basil including: Ocimum canum (Ram Tulsi or Kali Tulsi), O. basilicum or O. kilmand (bobai Tulsi), and O. scharicum (camphor Tulsi). The medicinal effect of all these varieties is verysimilar, if not the same. The energy of HolyBasil is spicy and warm, making it an effec-tive diaphoretic and febrifuge to help allevi-ate fevers, colds, sinus congestion, flu, andmost lung ailments. The meridian it targets is the respiratory system, particularly the lungs and also stomach and digestive system, mak-ing it a powerful carminative and helping to alleviate stomach cramps, vomiting, indigestion, intestinal catarrh, constipation,enteritis, whooping cough, headaches andmenstrual pains. Holy Basil removes excessKapha from the lungs and nasal passages,which increases Prana, the intake of air, andalso clears the mind and memory by removingVata from the colon and improving absorption. Other therapeutic actions of Holybasil are nervine, antispasmodic, antibacterialand antiseptic. It is also used for arthritisand rheumatic ailments. The aerial portions of Holy Basil are the most commonly used, but the seeds and wholeplant is useful as well. The leaves contain abright yellow volatile oil, which is usefulagainst insects and bacteria. A variety ofactive constituents have been isolated fromthe leaves. The principal constituents of thisoil are eugenol methyl estragol luteolin. The oil is reported topossess anti-bacterial properties and acts asan insecticide. Ayurveda recognizes Tulsi ashaving many medicinal properties.ACHS Introduces Our Ayurveda Corner By Gia von Karl, ACHS InstructorWhat 's New at the College? Continued on Page 3... Tulsi FlowerACHS Featured Class For March *Nat of my roles is to oversee ACHS's outcomes assessment program. It's a big job, but vitally important, since the info rmation we obtain from the various parts of our outcomes assessment plan is fed back into every department, from faculty to shipping, to m ake the school stronger and our students happier. I call it our \"cycle of improvement\". One of the parts of our outcomes assessment program is our annual student satisfaction survey. One of my degrees is in Economic s and Statistics, so I LOVE surveys, but this is probably one of the most important surveys we conduct each year. Aside from the fact that the results go to our accrediting agency, it is an invaluable tool for self-review. Our results are usually good, often great, but this year they were exceptional. (We'll be posting the full report at the websit e in the next few weeks so you can download it and take a look). Not only were the ratings very high, but also your responses were full of co mments indicating what you liked and why. I was really delighted that so many of you took the time to give us your positive feedback. What I found particularly helpful w as the feed- back from the few students who had some aspect they felt could be improved - almost without exception you had taken the time to think about a possible solution. This is such valuable feedback and allows us to implement changes much more quickly. I presented a paper on outcomes assessment at the DETC Fall Conference in Pennsylvania in October, and I was pleasantly surpris ed to hear how high our response rates were compared to other industries. I think it would be vain to take all the credit - I think w e get such high response rates because we're in the holistic health industry and our students and graduates care enough to share their vie ws and want to help make a difference. So, in a word, thanks! Thanks to all of you for completing the survey. Thanks to those who wrote suc h nice com- ments (which warmed our hearts) and for those of you who took the time to share ideas for new courses, added student services, or other improvements. But most importantly, thanks to the few of you who shared your dissatisfaction with us. This is probably the most valuable feedback of all, since it allows us to explore solutions for issues that have bothered you. In writing this note, I was reminded of a recent experience I had. I recently heard someone at a conference joke about sending staff online to make negative comments in newsgroups about their competitors. It's not the first time I've heard such a suggestion and my co lleague (who also overheard the comment) and I were lamenting how sad it is that any business person would think that this is a good us e for the internet! So, I am standing on my small soapbox with a request that each of us take a few minutes to spread some positivity. Let's each t ake it upon ourselves to turn the tide and spread a little cheer. I'm not just talking about saying nice things about ACHS (although that would be great!) but about anyone or everyone who does you a good turn - don't just tip that super nice waitress who helps you with your grumpy two year old - tell the manager on your way out how great she was. If you love a product, post a review and tell others about it. I personally rely a lot on reviews when choosing products, par- ticularly toys for my two year old! If you see your neighbors trash can blowing down the road, pick it up for them. If you have extra pro- duce in your garden, don't let it go to waste - give it to a neighbor, friend, or food bank. All sorts of opportunities for pos itivity cross our path every day. I think most of us want to feel like we're helping to make the world a better place, but sometimes, we're not s ure where to start. Remember that even small steps can brighten someone's day. Yes, the health and wellness industry is booming and that can mean change, but we have the power to work together to ensure tha t the industry remains a shining example of the power of positivity.

A How to..... Fill a container with seed mix and moisten (it should feel like a wrung-out dishcloth).Plastic pots and seed trays can benefitfrom a single layer of newspaper to pre-vent soil leaking, then fill your seed con-tainers to the top of the lip and tamp thesoil gently with the bottom of an identicalpot. Toy blocks are often a perfect matchfor cell packs. Sow seeds evenly in seed trays to encour- age good growth. Crowded seeds will beleggy and compete for nutrients. Smallseeds (lettuce and petunias) need to beplanted less than a centimeter apart, medi-um seeds (tomatoes and marigolds) a cen-timeter apart and large seeds (peas) at least 2.5 centimeters apart. In individual pots plant seeds towards the center of each pot or cell. Plant two seedsper pot. This method is ideal for zucchini,marrow and plants with large seeds thatneed real warmth to germinate. Cover the seeds according to the instruc- tions - some seeds germinate better with-out light, others prefer it. The rough rule isto cover seeds to three times their diame-ter. Label the container, as it is very easy tomuddle seedlings when juggling multiplesowings!
