Abstract: Objectiv es: A significant percentage of the population must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. Therefore the success of a vaccination program relies on the level of acceptance. This present study seeks to understand COVID-19 vaccine acceptance a nd hesitancy in Nigeria by assessing the public's willingness to get vaccinated. Study design: This is a population-based cross-sectional study. Data were derived through a structured o nline survey. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult residents in Ni geria in March 2021 using a structured online questionnaire. T he questionnaire surveyed participants' demographic characteristics and perception of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics using Chi-square, as well as univariable logistic regression to determine the factors associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine was cond ucted. Results: Of the 618 respondents, 272 (44%) reported be ing willing to get vaccinated . Interestingly, of the 346 (56%) respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the highe st marginal reasons for non-acceptance were lack of trust in the government 163 (47.1%) , followed by the belief that the vaccine is not safe 67 (19.4%), and no enough information about the vaccine 49 (13.6%). In addition, male respondents and those with a university degree or above we re statistically significantly more 269 AIMS Medical Science V olume 9, Issue 2, 268-282. likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: A considerable proportion of the study population is unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This obs ervation highlights the need for the government, public health officials, and advocacy groups to imp lement immediate awareness-raising measures to sway the public tow ards COVID-19 vaccine acceptance . Keywords: vaccine acceptance; vaccine hes itancy; COVID-19; Nigeria; vacc ine coverage 1. Introduction The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19, caused b y severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1]. Currently, s t r a i n s o f t h e v i r u s h a v e b e e n r eported, suggesting possible mu lti-point transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 [2,3]. In addition to the health crisis, the COVID-1 9 pandemic has disrupted the financial and social systems of most countries and pushed more populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) b elow the poverty line, thus ex acerbating wealth inequality [4,5]. Sadly, the current pandemic is predicted to impose more morbidi ty and mortality burdens while simultaneously disrupting an already fragile society and world economy [4-6]. As with past outbreaks, the novel nature of the current coronavirus led expe rts to recommend non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) as the most effective public health interve ntions against COVID-19, as no definitive therapy existed for its treatment [7,8]. Nigeria reported its first con firmed case on February 27th, 202 0, the first reported case in sub-Saharan Africa [9-11]. As of March 31st, 2022, of over 11.3 COVID-19 cases (with 251260 deaths) reported in Africa, Nigeria accounts for 255415 cases which are approximately 2.3% of the continent' COVID-19 burden [12]. The Nigerian Government preemp tively announced a series of strict measures, including the early adoption of a lockdown (in early March), followed by an instant nationwide public awareness campaign about COVID-19 prevention and control measures [7]. The lockdown represented a solution to a crisis for which Nigeria w as ill-equipped from a public health perspective. Equally, the lockdown was a crucial measure to buy some time to prepare for the surge of COVID-19 cases. On a positive note, the age brackets in Nige ria have been hypothesized as one factor responsible for the low mortality rate [10]. Nigeria has a relatively young population, with 62% of Nigeria's population bei ng younger than 35 years, while only 7% are older t han 65 [11]. This age factor could have spared Nigeria high mortality from a dise ase that poses a greater danger to the elderly. The announcement of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine was a rguably the most significant development since the World Health Organization declared COVID- 19 a pandemic. Vaccines are safe, cost-friendly, and effectiv e in reducing or eradicating d iseases. However, despite the ample scientific evidence supporting va ccines' safety and efficacy, t he spread and normalization of myths and anti-vaccine information have greatly threatened Africa's m ass vaccination campaign [8]. The reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite availability of vacc ines can be defined as vaccine hesitancy, according to the WHO, is one of the top ten threats to health a nd well-being in 2019 [13]. Sadly, these threats are heightened by misinformation and the spread o f fake news and can reverse progress in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases. Globally, the number of deaths due to vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) has significantly reduced in the past few decad es. Except for cancer and 270 AIMS Medical Science V olume 9, Issue 2, 268-282. tuberculosis, the number of deat hs from VPDs declined from 4.1 m in 1990 (9% of the total death) to 2-3 million in 2010 (5% of the tot al death) [14]. A further 1.5 million deaths could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations is improved [13]. Vaccination c ontrols mortality, morbidity, and complications associated with infectious diseases; thus, expand ing robust and routine vaccination programs is one fundamental way to reduce the incidence of infe c t i o u s d i s e a s e s s u c h a s COVID-19 [8,15]. Unfortunately, the accelerated pace of vaccine d e v e l o p m e n t h a s f u r t h e r heightened public anxieties [16] . This could also compromise CO VID-19 vaccine acceptance in a country that in 2003 witnessed one of the worst ever situations of vaccine hesitancy in Africa during the polio vaccination program [8,17,18]. A global survey showed that 65.2% of participants from Nigeria would be willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine were available [6]. Ho wever, this survey was carried out ten months ago, and a lot has changed since then regarding the vast and evolving range of misinformation and conspiracy the ories circulating. This misinf ormation could affect public confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine, resulting in an acute incre ase in the levels of vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, it is crucial to gauge Nigerians' current levels of willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and determine correlations between vaccine hesitancy an d/or acceptance. Hence, this study's objectives were to identify how a dults in Nigeria are willing t o receive a COVID-19 vaccine and examine whether socio-demographic factors and attitudes toward COVID-19 are associated with their acceptance or refusal of the COVID-19 vaccine. This study also attempted to understand the reasons for COVID-19 vaccine ref usals among the general Nigeria n population. 2. Methods 2.1. Study design and data collection This cross-sectional study was developed using an anonymous onl ine-based questionnaire. Recruitment of responde nts was performed usi ng targeted adverti sing on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter. Also, to obtain more respondents, our social media networks were urged to share the internet-based qu estionnaire with their networks, and data were collected using Google Forms. Eligible participants i n the online survey were expected to be 18 years of age or older, a Nigerian citizen and resident in Nigeria, read and understand English with access to the internet. The COVID-19 vaccine acceptance ra te was evaluated using established questionnaires [6,19], and three independent reviewers undertoo k a pretest to assess readability, comprehensibility, and validity. However, the questionnaire uti lized in this study was tailored to be short, concise, and easy to understand. 2.2. Analytical measures A structured questionnaire was developed in the English languag e to collect data. This questionnaire comprised of 8 que stions under four main themes, as follows: (1) demographics, which participants' socio-dem ographic information; (2) attit udes toward COVID-19; (3) willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, and (4) reason for no t accepting a COVID-19 vaccine. The questionnaire was pre-validated by three independent review ers, and a pre-test study was conducted with four individuals. Demographics such as personal details, including age, gender, level 271 AIMS Medical Science V olume 9, Issue 2, 268-282. of education, and average monthly income, were collected. The o verall attitude towards COVID-19 was measured using a one-item question, \"Do you think COVID-19 is real?\"\u2014with a Yes or No option. Among the variables assessed was the willingness of res pondents to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when it is widely available in Nigeria. To be more spec ific, participants were asked: \"Will you accept the COVID-19 vaccine if it is generally available in Nigeria?\", and the three potential answers were \"Yes\", \"No\" and \"Don't know.\" Afterwards, No and D on't Know responses were considered No to dichotomize the acceptance variable during sta tistical analysis. To gain insight into the reason for vaccine refusal a nd hesitancy, participants who answered No or Don't know to the question about willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine were as ked two more questions (i) \"Why won't you accept COVID- 19 vaccine?\", and the six potential answ ers were \"religious reasons\", \"lack of trust in the government\", \"I will contract COVID-19 if I tak e the vaccine\", \"I don't the vaccine is safe\", \"no much information about the vaccine\", or \"other: whic h allowed the participants to input their reason for COVID-19 vaccine r efusal or hesitancy\"; and (i i) \"what will encourage you to accept a COVID-19 vaccine?\", and the potential answers were \"I will ac cept COVID-19 vaccine if more people take it\", \"I will accept COVID-19 vaccine if more inform ation about the vaccine is given\", or \"Nothing will make me accept COVID-19 vaccine.\" 2.3. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to outline the demographic cha racteristics of the sample population. Univariable analyses o f the participants' demograph ic characteristics and willingness of respondents to accept COVID-19 in Nigeria were carried out using the chi- square tests. Furthermore, we conducted univariable logistic r egression to compute odds ra tios (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) and corresponding P-values for the association between each socio-demographic characteristic and vaccine acceptance. 2-tailed statistical tes ts were used in this study, with a P-value of <0.05 considered statistical significance. Statistical analy ses were conducted using SAS JMP Statistical DiscoveryTM Software version 14.3 (SAS Institu te, Cary, North Carolina, US A). 2.4. Ethical consideration This study followed all the ethical protocols involved in condu cting studies involving human participants recommended by the National Health Research Ethics Committee of Nigeria, Federal Minister of Health. The ethical approval consent for this study was obtained from Abia State Teaching University Hospital Ethics and Research Committee with approval number/ID ABSUTH/MAC/117/VOL.11/74. Participan ts were aware of the purpos e of the study and provided informed consent before accessi ng the questionnaire. Respondent s were also provided with information that stated their participation was voluntary, and confidentiality and anonymity were also ensured. 272 AIMS Medical Science V olume 9, Issue 2, 268-282. 3. Results 3.1. Socio-demographic characte ristics of participants The respondents' characteristics and a summary of the survey qu estions are listed in Table 1. Of the total 617 respondents recruited in the survey, 56.8% were b etween 25 and 54 years old. Of all participants, 49% were male, 51% were female, 30.7% of all part icipants earned more than $134 per month. In comparison, most of our respondents had received a un iversity degree (62%), followed by 17.3% who are still undergraduates. Table 1.

Health belief As shown in Figure 1 significant proportion of the participants , 91.7% ( n = 5 6 7 ) , b e l i e v e d COVID-19 was not a hoax. However, surprisingly, a few participa nts, 8.3% ( n = 5 1 ), ag re ed t h at 273 AIMS Medical Science V olume 9, Issue 2, 268-282. there was no COVID-19 in Nig eria. Furthermore, 46.2% ( n = 160) of the participants reported that they would only receive the COVID-19 vaccine if given adequate information about the vaccine, 35.3% ( n = 122) reported that nothing would persuade them to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, and 18.5% ( n = 64) reported that they would only take the vaccine if taken by many in public. Figure 1. Perception of COVID-19 in Nigeria ( n = 618). 3.3. Factors associated with acceptance and non-acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine Factors associated with the willingness of respondents to accept COVID-19 in Nigeria a r e presented in Table 2. In total, 44% ( n = 272) of respondents report ed their willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19, while 33.3% ( n = 206) confirmed that they are unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 22.7% ( n = 140) reported that they are unsure. The major reason for the non-acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among the respondents is a lack of trust in the government 47.1% ( n = 163), followed by the belief that the vaccine is not safe 19 .4% ( n = 67), and not enough information about the vaccine 13.6% ( n = 49). Other reasons for COVID-19 vaccine refusal were fear of contracting COVID-19 through the vaccine 5.5% ( n = 21) and religious reasons 3.75% ( n = 13) as shown in Figure 2. Our results revealed that gender ( 2 = 8.95, P-value = 0.011 ), educational level = 30.62, = 0.023 ) are statistically associatied with with willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccine. W e also observed that males were significantly associated with lower odds of accepting vaccines than females (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 -0.88). However, income level, educational status, and age were not significantly associated with willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine (Table 2). 91.7%8.3%Do you think COVID19 is real?

Figure 2. Reasons for the unwillingness of the adult population to accept COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria ( n = 346). 4. Discussion Like any other vaccination program, the success of the current COVID-19 vaccination program depends on the level of acceptanc e . A l o w r a t e o f v a c c i n a t i o n c overage due to non-acceptance directly correlates with not ach ieving herd immunity and exposu re to the most vuln erable population. As a result, it is critical to understand the people's intentio n to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, thus, giving time to design and carry out targeted public health inte rventions and awareness campaigns to inform the public about the importance of vaccination. After al l, as demonstrated in this study, 46.2% ( n = 160) of the participants reported that they would only recei ve the COVID-19 vaccine if given adequate information about the vaccine. This suggests tha t hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccine can be swayed towards acceptance if presented with the correct information. In this context, the aim of this nationwide cross -sectional survey conducted in Nigeria was to evaluate the vaccination intents of the general adult population and factors that might affect acceptance, refusal, and hesitancy. Previous studies [6,20] in the area of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy have been carried out. However, the fact that vaccine decisions are multifactorial [8,21], and can Lack of trust in the governmentI don't think the vaccine is safeNo enough information about the vaccineI might contract COVID19 for nonacceptance277 AIMS Medical Science V olume 9, Issue 2, 268-282. alter over time makes this study relevant. Its results are expe cted to influence public engagement measures taken by public health officials. Findings from our study revealed t hat a significant proportion of individuals, 56% were unwilling or unsure about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, and onl y 44% stated that they would get vaccinated. Based on the estimates of the reproduction number ( R0) [22,23] or through vaccination, this percentage of people willing to get vaccinated is not stro ng enough to achieve herd immunity. Comparing the acceptance rate of our study with that of similar studies conducted in China (97%), Brazil (88%), Australia (88%), I (56%), Hungary (56%), and France (59%), according to a survey by World Economic Forum's Ipsos involving nearly 20000 adults [24], and or other European countries (ranged from 62 to 80%) [25], it seems like Nigerians are more hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccine compared to other study populations. Furthermore, studies in Indonesia [26] and Malaysia [ 27] reported 93.3% and 94.3% acceptance rates, respectively. Our \"respondents\" willingness r ate is higher than reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo [28]. Contrarily, the two previous s tudies focused on Nigerian populations reported willingness rates of 74% [20] and 65.22% [ 6]. These contrasting findings further suggest that vaccinati on decision is an evolving phenom enon that changes over time, and if rates of acceptance remain low, the COVID-19 pandemic will cont inue to stifle public health systems and the country's economy. As an antidote, the Nigerian public health officials need to design and implement an aware ness campaign urgently to help boo st acceptance rates. Higher levels of education and low monthly income were also ass ociated with high vaccine acceptance rates. These findings align with studies in the UK [29] and Australia [30] . Among demographically defined groups, the willingness rate was least among those with lower education, while a study in Greece [31] demonstrated the opposite. Therefo re, while its imperative to design effective vaccine communication st rategies, it is crucial to ca refully consider the general literacy level of the subpopulations [21], as well as identify tradition ally and locally trusted means of communication [8] that go beyond simply voicing that vaccines a re safe and effective. Interestingly, as drivers of vaccine hesitancy rely greatly on both belief system s and personal experiences [31], it will be more effective to boost vaccine literacy and acceptance by directly addressing community-specific concerns or misconceptions, socio-cultural i ssues, religious or philosophical beliefs that breed distrust in v accination programs. Although r esearchers have identified behavioural insights, culturally appropriate a nd evidence-based communicati ons are promising interventions for building confidence and reducing vaccine hesitancy in different contexts [32,33]. Other promising tools have been developed primari ly for high-income countries [ 34]. However, these tools will require careful adjustme nt to make them suitable for use in Afr ican nations. Therefore, it is paramount to adapt and validate such existing vaccine hesitancy measurement tools or develop new tools capable of monitoring COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across A frican countries, enhancing the comparability of research findings , and facilitati ng a more rob ust evidence-based intervention. Generally, women in this study were less likely to accept vacci nes than men; however, this association was not strong. This finding could help the Nigeria n government, health professionals, policymakers, and non-governmental organizations to target inte rventions around COVID-19 vaccination programs effectively. Furthermore, about 56% of our study population showed unwillingness in accepting the COVID-19 vaccine. Comparatively, these results were significantly greater than what was reported i n Russia (47%), Poland (45%), H ungary (44%), France (41%), (33%), Germany (33%), Italy (33%), Brazil (12%), 278 AIMS Medical Science V olume 9, Issue 2, 268-282. Australia (12%), India (13%), Malaysia (15%), UK (15%), Saudi rabia (16%), South Korea (16%), Peru (21%), China (3%), and Cana d a ( 2 4 % ) a c c o r d i n g t o a r e c e n t survey by World Economic Forum's Ipsos involving nearly 20000 adults on whether they wil l take COVID-19 vaccine or not when it is available [24]. Our findings revealed that trust is not only an intrinsic compo nent of a vaccination program but also a changeable factor in the successful uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, our findings show that lack of trust in the government is strongly associate d with vaccine refusal and can contribute to non-compliance of the public with recommended pro tocols. From our observation, the top three reasons for the non-acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccin e are lack of trust in the government, the belief that the vaccine is not safe, and concer ns there is not enough information about the vaccine. Lessons from past infectious disease outbrea ks have pointed out that one of the key contributors to disease cont rol is trusted information and guidance [35] . However, its multifactorial, complex, and co ntext-dependent characteristics would take more than building trust to adequately address vaccine hesitancy. Hence, it is equally impo rtant to address vaccine hesitancy simultaneously at federal , state, and local levels. As this study has shown, it is p aramount that the government an d public health officials adopt clear, consistent, and competent communication to build public confidence in the COVID-19 vaccination program. This includes, but is not limited to, usin g a simple linguistic approach to explaining how vaccines work and how they are developed, includ ing regulatory approval based on safety and efficacy. In a simila r vein, effective campaigns sho uld be designed to carefully explain the COVID-19 vaccine's level of effectiveness, the required period for protection if double doses are required, and the significance of comprehensive coverage in ach ieving herd immu nity. Above all, credible and culturally informed health communication would be influential in swaying the minds of the fence-sitters towards COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. 5. Limitations In interpreting the results of this current study, it is essent ial to consider some limitations. Firstly, our study used an online survey, involving only those who can read or write English and have access to the internet which may have resulted in sampling bias; hence, the results may not be an accurate representation of the wider population. One of the core disadvantages of online-based surveys is the generality and validity of results, which mandat es a careful analysis and interpretation of the research findings [36,37]. Our survey results show that pa rticipants between the ages of 24-54 are over-represented, while older adults aged 65 and above are under-represented. Secondly, the responses from this nationwide survey were focused on self-repo rt. As a result, it may likely be subject to self-reporting bias and a likelihood of respondents choosing socially desirable responses. Further investigation using ot her methodologically appropriate tools is needed to conclusively assess vaccination willingness in differe nt behavioural and sociocultu ral contexts. 6. Conclusions Contrary to previous studies c onducted before the COVID-19 vacc ine, this present study has shown that individual vaccination intention can change over tim e, particularly when a vaccine becomes available. Summarily in March 2021, more than half of t he adult population surveyed 279 AIMS Medical Science V olume 9, Issue 2, 268-282. reported being hesitant towards the Covid-19 vaccine. Women, yo unger people aged 18-24, and less educated individuals could be po tential target g roups for strat egic interventions aiming to sway the public toward COVID-19 vaccination acceptance. These findings a re expected to provide valuable insights to government agencies, public health officials, and h ealth care workers to address the impact of vaccine hesitancy. Furthermore, this observation high lights the need to implement immediate awareness-raising measu res to communicate and engage with the public toward COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.
