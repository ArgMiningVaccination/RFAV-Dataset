These are all possible [signs of seizure](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093). Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that causes different types of seizures. Research has shown that acupuncture and TCM treatment for epileptic seizures can be an effective adjunct to conventional treatment. Epilepsy is a common disease of the central nervous system that can happen to people of all ages. Epilepsy is a term that can refer to a variety of different types of seizures; it defines a condition in which a person has recurrent seizures. Over 3 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with epilepsy; it is one of the [most common](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/epilepsy) neurological disorders worldwide. What is the cause of seizures? Unusual electrical activity in brain cells [can cause various types of seizures](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/about-epilepsy-basics/what-causes-epilepsy-and-seizures), depending on what area of the brain is affected. In some cases, people begin to have seizures due to a head injury, or a brain infection, such as [meningitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-meningitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Some people seem to be born with an unusual brain structure that affects the area of the brain that causes seizures. In older people, symptoms of epilepsy may coexist with those of other neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, or seizures may start occurring as an effect of having suffered a [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or [heart attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Seizures can be caused by an allergic reaction to some food, as when a person with [Celiac disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) is exposed to gluten. Medical science has not yet discovered the exact meaning of seizures that occur in other cases, but it is thought to be due to genetics. People with epilepsy need treatment to try to prevent or reduce seizures. While some seizures are mild, others can be severe, and even life-threatening. TCM has been using acupuncture treatment and herbs to help seizures for many, many years, and recent research is beginning to [demonstrate how TCM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292226/) as integrative care for epilepsy can be beneficial. What Happens During a Seizure? The signs of seizure [can vary widely](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/about-epilepsy-basics/facts-about-seizures-and-epilepsy) from person to person, but an individual's specific pattern of what seizures look like will usually remain consistent. Symptoms of seizure include: - A range of changes in awareness: from staring and being unresponsive, up to totally losing consciousness - Stiffening of the limbs, limbs twitching, or part of the [body shaking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-essential-tremor-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Changes in vision: double vision, seeing flashes of light, staring, or blinking repeatedly [Dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), sudden [headache](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Sweating, nausea - Having trouble breathing, or stop breathing - Falling down for no apparent reason, sudden collapse, head nodding, muscles go limp, sometimes called \" [drop attacks\"](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Loss of bladder or bowel control - Feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [panic attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), fear - Sense of having an \"out of body\" experience - Strange taste in mouth or smelling strange smells - Feelings of confusion - Drooling or frothing at the mouth, biting tongue or inside of cheeks - After the seizure, a person may feel exhausted, or have [amnesia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), trouble remembering what happened. Historically, there have been many misconceptions about people who suffer from seizures, or \"fits disease.\" When a person is not having a seizure, they are usually otherwise healthy and capable. People with epilepsy are not necessarily limited in what they can do physically or mentally-except when they are having a seizure-,unless they have other chronic health problems in addition to epilepsy. If you see someone having a seizure, DO stay near them and make sure they are safe. If they fall or seem to be unconscious, turn them onto their side and make sure they are breathing. DO NOT try to physically restrain a person who is having a seizure or attempt to put anything in their mouth. The idea that a person might swallow their tongue while having a seizure is a myth. Top 10 Types of Seizures There are many types of seizures. Sometimes a person has one one seizure caused by medication, drug withdrawal, illness, or some sort of trauma to the brain. A person may have a seizure due to an [allergic reaction](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-allergy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) to some kind of medication or food. Experiencing one seizure does not mean a person is epileptic. Epilepsy is only diagnosed if a person has multiple seizures over time. Seizures are divided into two main categories: focal onset or generalized onset. \"Focal\" refers to a seizure that originates from a localized part of one of the hemispheres of the brain. \"Generalized\" means that there is seizure-causing activity happening all over, or on both sides of the brain. Specific types of seizure include: - Focal Seizure with Retained Awareness - Or, \"focal onset aware seizure.\" Used to be known as a \"simple partial seizure\" or \"partial seizures.\" These are usually short in duration (less than 2 minutes) and a person remains conscious and aware while it is happening, although they may not be able to respond to people around them, or they seem \"frozen.\" The specific feelings vary widely: a sense of deja vu, sense of pressure or anxiety, a strange, overpowering smell, etc. - Focal Onset Impaired Awareness seizure - also used to be called \"complex partial seizures,\" \"temporal lobe seizures,\" or \"psychomotor seizures.\" In this type of seizure, the person loses awareness of their surroundings. They may seem to be staring, zoning out, picking at their clothing, wandering aimlessly, smacking their lips, or making grunting sounds. These, too, are short in duration, and afterwards, the person may feel confused and very sleepy. - Febrile seizures - these are seizures that are caused by having a fever over 100 degrees, usually as a result of having some type of infection, like a flu. [Febrile seizure](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/febrile-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20372522)happens in young children; they may have shaking all over or jerking limbs, convulsions, or lose consciousness. Occasionally children may have febrile seizures in response to having a fever after receiving a vaccination. Febrile seizures do not cause brain damage or indicate a neurological disorder; they do not mean a person has epilepsy. - Absence Seizure - used to be called \"petit mal seizure.\" This is a type of generalized onset seizure in which a person briefly loses awareness, or \"blanks out\" for just a matter of seconds. They are caused by abnormal brain activity, possibly related to hyperventilation. [Absence seizures](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/epilepsy/absence-seizures)are more common in children, who may outgrow this disorder. - Myoclonic Seizure - this is a very short kind of seizure that causes muscles to jerk or twitch for just a few seconds. \"Myo\" means muscle, and \"clonus\" means contraction and relaxation. These can happen to people with epilepsy, but [myoclonic seizures](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/myoclonic-seizures)can also happen to anyone. That feeling of being jerked awake and having a spasm in your legs when you are falling asleep is a kind of myoclonus. - Tonic Clonic Seizure - this used to be known as \"grand mal seizure.\" This is the type of seizure that causes convulsions, stiff arms and legs, shaking all over, and other symptoms such as losing bladder control, crying out or making strange sounds, losing consciousness, and falling to the ground. A person who has experienced [tonic clonic seizures](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/epilepsy/tonic-clonic-grand-mal-seizures)before may notice an \"aura\" before the more severe symptoms of seizure begin; this might include a sense of vertigo, dizziness, nausea, feelings of anxiety, or strange smells or a weird taste in the mouth. Tonic clonic seizures may last a few minutes, and the person may be exhausted and emotional afterwards. - Refractory Seizures or Uncontrolled Seizures - also called \"drug-resistant\" or \"intractable\" seizures, this is when a person has frequent and/or severe seizures that do not respond to medical therapy such as anti-epileptic medications. - Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) - LGS is a rare form of epilepsy that shows up very early in life, usually when a child is still in infancy. [Lennox Gastaut](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/lennox-gastaut-syndrome/)causes various kinds of seizures, both tonic (muscle spasms) and atonic (staring, still), or absence seizures. Children with LGS may experience multiple seizures per day, and have [learning delays](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)due to cognitive dysfunction.The cause of LGS is sometimes unknown, but it can be due to abnormal brain development, or a baby having some type of infection or loss of oxygen in utero, before they're born. - West Syndrome - also called \"infantile spasms,\" this is a type of epilepsy in young children that causes spasms and unusual movements for a baby, like throwing out of the arms, straightening the arms out to the sides, knees pulled up to the chest, the upper body bending forward, or head thrown back. [West syndrome](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/w/west-syndrome.html)seizures only last a few seconds, and they usually go away by the time a child is past toddler years. - Status epilepticus - This is a neurological emergency condition in which abnormal brain activity causes a prolonged seizure that lasts longer than five minutes, or multiple seizures that occur back-to-back without recovery in between. This can happen to a person who has epilepsy, or it can happen due to trauma, such as a head injury, or a hypertensive ( [high blood pressure)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/)situation, or a severe reaction to drug toxicity, or an autoimmune disease response. There could be motor symptoms of shaking and collapsing, or the person could just be staring and unresponsive, depending on where the disordered activity is happening in the brain. Status epilepticus is a true medical emergency, and a person needs immediate attention to prevent brain damage. Medical Treatment for Epileptic Seizures Conventional treatment for seizures usually involves medications known as anticonvulsants (anticonvulsive), or anti-seizure [medications](https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/medications-treat-seizures). First, it is necessary for doctors to accurately diagnose the problem: what type of seizures is a person having, and what is causing them? Some drugs help to stop seizures from happening in the short term. Tranquilizers like Valium (Diazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam), and Klonopin may help to stop a seizure while it is happening, but people build up a tolerance quickly to these medications and then have to take higher doses to get the same effect. Other medications, like Aptiom, are taken daily to prevent seizures. There are many other medications used to treat different types of epilepsy, but these medications only work to control seizures in some cases. Other people may struggle to find a medication they can tolerate. Anticonvulsants and other anti-epileptic drugs can cause side effects like weakness, dizziness, headaches, nausea or vomiting, and skin rash. People who experience seizures do need treatment to control epileptic symptoms, but it can be challenging to find the right combination of therapies. Acupuncture and [TCM treatment offer an alternative](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2014/12/25/tcm-for-epilepsy-and-seizure-disorders) treatment that may help to control seizures without negative side effects. Can Acupuncture Help Epilepsy Symptoms? TCM has a long history-over 2000 years-of helping people who have epileptic seizures. The first documentation of acupuncture treatment for seizures by TCM practitioners was written at least 200 years B.C.. Specific Chinese herbs to treat epilepsy have been used for many centuries, and are now being studied through scientific research to prove their efficacy. Several [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769134/) have shown that various herbal formulations help to reduce the frequency of seizures. [Data also show](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-10857-0_12) that acupuncture treatment can help alleviate symptoms of epilepsy, reducing the occurrence of seizures through its positive effect on neurotransmitters in the brain. According to TCM theory, epilepsy usually arises due to problems with the Liver system. Too much Wind affecting the Liver can cause spasms or convulsions. Liver Yang Rising can lead to muscle twitching and/or dizziness. An acupuncturist will use a combination of modalities such as acupuncture treatment, electro-acupuncture, Chinese herbs, and therapeutic massage to help seizures. As with so many health conditions, inflammation plays a role in epileptic seizures. Auricular acupuncture [(ear acupuncture](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/615476/)) and [electro-acupuncture](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00601-1) (electro-stim) may have an anti-inflammatory effect on the brain that helps to reduce the frequency of seizures. TCM theory posits that stimulation of specific acupressure points (such as [\"Shenmen\" points on head](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) or ear) for epilepsy can help to calm the mind and produce a [positive effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292226/) on the parasympathetic nervous system. A [recent study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1306-acupuncture-synergizes-epilepsy-relief-new-finding) compared patients who received the standard medication therapy for epilepsy with those who had acupuncture treatments for 12 weeks in addition to drug therapy. At a one year follow up, the patients who had received acupuncture for seizures had a statistically significant improvement of their epilepsy symptoms compared with patients who had received only the conventional medical treatment. Acupuncture Near Me for Epileptic Seizures Los Angeles Area It is challenging to manage seizures, but it is possible for people with epilepsy to live a long and healthy life with minimal disruptions. Living with a chronic and unpredictable health condition like epileptic seizures can cause emotional suffering in addition to physical symptoms. The holistic approach provided by TCM and acupuncture treatment can be considered as a safe form of complementary alternative medicine for epilepsy. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Parkinson's Disease With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-parkinsons-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Hand tremor or shaky hands, stiffness in limbs, trouble walking, or problems with balance? These may be signs of [Parkinson's Disease (PD).](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/what-is-parkinsons) Parkinsons is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects the brain cells that produce dopamine. Integrative care with [acupuncture treatment may help relieve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5279085/) symptoms of Parkinson's disease better than conventional treatments alone. Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that causes damage and dysfunction in brain cells, so that communications between the brain and the body don't work the way they usually do. Sometimes a range of symptoms similar to those experienced by people with Parkinson's occurs due to small strokes that affect the blood supply to the brain. This condition is called vascular parkinsonism. More than ten million people are currently living with [Parkinson's disease worldwide](https://www.parkinson.org/Understanding-Parkinsons/Statistics). The chances of having PD increase with age, and men are more likely to have Parkinson's than women. Early onset Parkinson's can occur in people under 50. While it is often considered a movement disorder that causes hand tremors and other problems with mobility, Parkinson's disease can cause less obvious symptoms, too. Parkinson's disease causes both \"motor\" and \"non-motor symptoms;\" the motor symptoms include physical problems like [trembling hands](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-essential-tremor-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or hand shaking, stiffness in the arms and legs, and trouble with balance when walking. The non-motor symptoms may include cognitive problems with memory, foggy-headedness, and trouble sleeping. It might even seem like a person's personality and social behavior change, because they have trouble speaking and making their usual facial expressions. Neurological diseases like Parkinson's can slow the production of chemicals usually produced by the nervous system, including both dopamine and norepinephrine, a chemical that constricts blood vessels to raise blood pressure. It may be this lack of norepinephrine that causes some of the [symptoms of Parkinson's](https://www.parkinson.org/Understanding-Parkinsons/Symptoms/Movement-Symptoms/Dizziness-or-Fainting), such as low blood pressure, digestive problems, and fatigue. Parkinson's is a progressive disease, which means that people with PD go through stages as the condition affects more and more brain cells. In the early stages, the motor symptoms are mild and may only occur on one side of the body. In the later stages, a person may not be able to perform basic daily activities like getting dressed, eating, or walking without assistance. What causes [Parkinson's disease](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/parkinsons-disease)? Medical science does not currently have an answer for why the brain cells become damaged or die in people with Parkinson's. Scientists have observed that patients with Parkinson's often have unusual clumps of a protein (alpha-synuclein) in their brain cells; these are called \"lewy bodies\" (lewy body parkinsons). These may be causing mutations in the cells that impair their ability to produce dopamine and other neurochemicals. Genetics, aging, and toxins in the environment or diet may all play a role in the development of Parkinson's. Conventional treatment for Parkinson's involves finding a combination of medications that may help to reduce tremors and stiffness, and the myriad other symptoms a person with PD may experience. TCM offers an effective and safe adjunctive Parkinson's treatment. Acupuncture treatment is widely accepted as a way to help relieve pain and nausea related to all types of diseases. [TCM treatment](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/acupuncture-and-massage-for-parkinsons-disease/) can also have a positive effect on neurochemical activity, [ increase dopamine levels](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00102/full), help improve motor function and gait, and relieve fatigue. Top 10 Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease The [early signs of Parkinson's](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/10-early-warning-signs) are generally related to movements of the body, like feeling stiff when getting up or mild hand tremors. People may not realize that other symptoms, like low blood pressure and [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), are also related to early stage Parkinson's. The most common symptoms of Parkinson's disease include: - Tremor - a small, involuntary shaking movement occurs most often in the hands, but can also be in a finger or thumb, or the chin. Sometimes called static tremor or resting tremor. - Trouble moving or walking - limbs may feel stiff or rigid, there may be h [ip pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hip-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or [shoulder pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shoulder-pain-by-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Most noticeably, the arms may not swing naturally when a person walks, or a person may shuffle, feeling it is hard to lift their feet off the floor. Movements that have been automatic for one's whole life become challenging. - Dizziness - fainting or feeling dizzy when you get up from sitting or lying down. This happens due to a sudden drop in blood pressure called orthostatic hypotension. A general feeling of weakness, feeling lightheaded, foggy headed, [headache](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [blurred vision](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-glaucoma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [difficulty thinking or concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [memory problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Change in handwriting - this symptom is called micrographia, and it refers to a noticeable difference in a person's writing, as they make smaller letters and the words are crowded closer together. - Loss of smell, loss of taste, loss of appetite - many people with Parkinson's develop an inability to smell in the early stage of the disease, known as olfactory loss. This can also affect a person's ability to taste foods, which can lead to loss of appetite. Some medical theories suggest that Parkinson's may begin in the olfactory region of the brain. - Disturbed sleep, sleep disorder - [sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)might simply be trouble falling asleep or trouble staying asleep, but they may also involve a lot of movement, or \"tossing and turning,\" or even talking in your sleep, crying out or yelling due to vivid dreams. [Restless leg syndrome,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)when the limbs jerk, or leg cramps, may also be caused by Parkinson's. - Constipation, nausea, or trouble swallowing - cell damage in the gut may actually be one of the first symptoms of Parkinson's, causing [gastrointestinal problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acid-reflux-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)due to slower movements of the smooth muscles of the digestive tract. Feeling nauseous or having a [bloated stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)happens when the contents of the stomach empty too slowly into the intestine. - Changes in the voice - people may notice that your voice sounds hoarse, weaker or more quiet than usual. This can be due to both motor and non-motor problems of PD, related to difficulty swallowing, sore throat due to heartburn, sensation of choking or food stuck in throat. It is also related to cognitive difficulties that make it harder to think of words, causing slow speech, or in other cases, talking too fast to be understood. Sometimes it may seem that a person with Parkinson's doesn't feel like talking much. - Changes in facial expression - called \"facial masking,\" some people with Parkinson's will find people asking them if they are upset because the expression on their face looks very serious, sad or angry, or they appear to be staring. This happens because of decreased motor function of the muscles of the face. - Changes in posture - people with Parkinson's may begin to hunch over while sitting, with shoulders hunched forward, or assuming a \"stooped\" posture while standing or walking. Again, this is due to a lack of communication between the brain and the muscles. This hunched posture can affect deep breathing, and increase the risk of falls. Parkinson's symptoms are complex, and vary widely from person to person. People with Parkinson's are often subject to feelings of depression and anxiety, as well. Treatment for Parkinson's symptoms requires a multipronged approach that addresses each individual patient's physical, emotional, and mental health. Medical Parkinson's Treatment When treating Parkinson's, doctors will often try various [combinations of drug therapy](https://www.michaeljfox.org/news/medications-motor-symptoms), some of which aim to replace dopamine, to help relieve tremors and other motor symptoms of PD. Levodopa/Carbidopa (or Sinemet) is a combination medication that creates a controlled release of dopamine. This can help to alleviate some symptoms, but the symptoms return when the medication is not in the bloodstream. Unfortunately, this medication can cause side effects like nausea and vomiting, and people will often need to take larger doses to get the same effect as the disease progresses. Long-term use sometimes causes dyskinesia, or involuntary movements of the limbs. Doctors may then prescribe another medication, such as Amantadine or Gocovri, to help mitigate these effects, or to help stave off motor symptoms during \"off\" times when the dopamine-replacing drugs wear off. Patients with Parkinson's will often be given other medications to help with problems like constipation, high blood pressure, sleep problems, pain, and depression. TCM and acupuncture offer a holistic way to treat many of the symptoms of Parkinson's at the same time, without so many drugs and their potential side effects. How Can Acupuncture Help Parkinson's? Part of TCM theory involves the concept of Ben and Biao, or \"Root and Branch.\" We observe that the expression of illness in the body is like the system of roots and branches of a tree. The branches show us the outward symptoms, while the root of the disease is hidden deeper under the surface, where we can't see it. In order to treat the symptoms of any illness, we study the branches to find out where the problem originates, then we go to the root of the problem to solve it. We do this with a combination of acupuncture, herbs, and other modalities like moxibustion, cupping, and tuina massage. These TCM treatments allow us to address problems in the organ systems of the body, where lie the roots of illness, while at the same time, helping to relieve the pains and uncomfortable symptoms occurring in the branches. [Parkinson's disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15339516/) is considered by TCM philosophy to occur due to deficiencies in the root, which cause excess in the branches. [Deficiency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254627217303242) of the kidney, liver, spleen, blood and Qi (root problems) contribute to heat, phlegm, stasis, and wind in the limbs (branches). Tremors in the hands, and changes in facial expressions and movements are caused by Wind and Phlegm. [According to TCM, Wind](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5234349/) causes problems, often in the upper body, that come and go, such as stiffness, spasms, facial tics, and shaking of the limbs-like the wind shaking the branches of a tree. Wind can also cause symptoms like [ringing in the ears (tinnitus),](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/) sudden headaches, and [hives](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hives-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Phlegm, which blocks the energy channels of the body, disrupts the smooth flow of blood and Qi to the limbs, creating a sense of stiffness, heaviness in the limbs, resistance to moving or speaking, staring, heavy feeling in the chest, and lack of coordination. [Acupuncture treatment](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=31370) for Parkinson's disease, then, focuses on clearing heat, wind, and phlegm, strengthening and nourishing the blood, and getting the Qi moving smoothly again. When we use acupuncture and herbs to help Parkinson's, we see changes occurring in the neurochemical activity of the brain. [One study](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/Fulltext/2018/12140/A_study_of_the_effects_of_8_week_acupuncture.36.aspx) looked at the changes in neural response in the brain immediately after acupuncture treatment. This study concluded that after 8 weeks of treatment, patients with Parkinson's showed significant improvement in brain function. Another [clinical study](https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/2019/06/05/acupuncture-may-help-prevent-motor-symptoms-mice-data-suggest/) showed that acupuncture helped to increase levels of Tyrosine hydroxylase, a brain chemical involved in the production of dopamine. TCM herbal formulas have also been [clinically demonstrated](https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/2020/04/17/chinese-herbal-medicine-contains-active-compounds-with-potential-treat-parkinsons-study-suggests/) to help relieve Parkinson's symptoms like speech problems, tremors, and gait disturbances. [Research](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/534861/) has shown that using TCM herbs to treat Parkinson's is a safe and effective adjunctive therapy to conventional medical treatment. Acupuncture Near Me for Parkinson's Disease Santa Monica Westside The goal of treatment for Parkinson's is to slow down the progression of the disease and do what we can to maintain mobility and cognitive function.

[ How to Treat HIV/AIDS With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hiv-aids-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac.,Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. What does it mean to be HIV positive? HIV is a viral infection that harms the immune system over time and, if untreated, can eventually lead to AIDS, a syndrome that causes people to become weaker and get serious infections easily. There is no cure for [HIV/AIDS](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/what-are-hiv-and-aids), but there are various therapies that can slow the progression of HIV. Acupuncture and TCM herbs can help to improve immune function and relieve symptoms related to the side effects of other HIV/AIDS drug therapies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that affects the immune system by destroying the white blood cells (CD4 and T-cells) that are such an important part of the body's immune response, causing people with HIV to be [ much more prone](https://www.avert.org/living-with-hiv/health-wellbeing/health-conditions) to all kinds of infections. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the late stage of HIV, in which the CD4 cells have reached a critical low point and other infections are taking hold in the body. [Over a million](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics) people in the U.S. are currently living with HIV. Many more people may have HIV and not know it. People can have HIV for several years without feeling any symptoms, while the illness is in its early stages. HIV is a progressive illness, which affects the functioning of the immune system over a long period of time. 4 Stages of HIV Infection: - Infection - when a person contracts the HIV virus, it spreads quickly in the body, often causing flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, rash, [sore throat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-sore-throat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). If you have these types of symptoms, and you think you may have had contact with an infected person or a needle recently, it is very important to go get tested for HIV. Early testing allows people to get treatment as soon as possible, and to know if they are contagious and can spread the virus to others. - Asymptomatic - the HIV virus remains in the body, causing damage to cells and weakening the immune system, while the person may have no symptoms of HIV/AIDS. This latent stage of HIV can last for quite a long time, averaging 8-10 years. This is why many people do not realize they have HIV until they are tested. - Symptomatic - Eventually, a person with HIV will begin to feel the effects: fatigue, mouth sores from oral candidiasis, diarrhea, and weight loss. Other infectious diseases can easily get into the body because of the weakened immune system; these are called opportunistic infections. Common co-infections associated with include: tuberculosis (TB), [cryptococcal meningitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-meningitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), toxoplasmosis, [hepatitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hepatitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [pneumonia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pneumonia-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - HIV progression to AIDS - In some cases, people with HIV who receive treatment to help boost their immunity are able to stave off progression into the AIDS stage of illness. However, if the CD4 cell count drops and other infections take hold, a person is considered to have progressed into the AIDS stage. Being diagnosed with HIV can be emotionally devastating. Knowing you have a serious illness with no cure is naturally going to cause a lot of [ stress,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), and even [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). With good health care, it is possible these days to live a long life with HIV. Putting together a team of caring health care professionals who can provide integrative care for HIV/AIDS will help you maintain the best physical and mental health possible. TCM provides [holistic care for patients living with HIV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4690280/) or AIDS that works on all levels: keeping your mental outlook positive, helping you sleep better, boosting immune function, and relieving symptoms that are due to side effects of medical treatment, or caused by concurrent infections. How Do You Get HIV/AIDS? The [HIV virus is carried](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/how-is-hiv-transmitted) through certain bodily fluids: blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breastmilk. In order for HIV to be transmitted from one person to another, one of these types of body fluids must have the infection present in it, and must get into the other person's bloodstream through broken skin or mucous membrane. HIV is not transmitted through saliva, sweat, urine, or feces, and is not carried in the air in droplets. You cannot get HIV through water or air, or by touching surfaces. The way that HIV is most often passed from person to person is through sexual contact. Other ways you can get HIV are by sharing needles while using drugs, getting a tattoo with a needle that wasn't properly sanitized, or a blood transfusion. (As a reminder: we only use single-use, disposable, sterile needles for acupuncture treatment.) A woman could also pass HIV to her baby when breastfeeding. Using condoms during sex and only using sterilized needles are the primary ways to prevent HIV infection. Top 10 Symptoms of HIV Most people with HIV will go through a long phase of having no noticeable symptoms. Eventually, after the virus has spread slowly, people with HIV will begin to show symptoms such as: [Fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), feeling tired all the time - Fever, or feeling hot even if you don't show a fever [Diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - I [nsomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/), night sweats - Weakness, [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Weight loss, wasting, loss of appetite - Nausea - Skin rash, or purple spots on skin, bruise easily - Shortness of breath - Swollen lymph glands [Oral candidiasis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK367577/), also known as thrush or oral [candida](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-candida-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), is also common among people living with HIV because the suppressed immune system makes it easier for the fungal infection to take hold. Burning sensation or pain in the mouth cavity and redness with white patches are the signs of oral candidiasis. Long-term use of antifungal medication (Fluconazole) to control thrush can cause side effects and eventually cease to be effective as the body develops a resistance to it. HIV can also lead to neurological problems, like peripheral [neuropathy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), in which the signals between the brain and the rest of the body are compromised, causing symptoms like: muscle twitching, loss of balance and coordination, tingling or burning sensations, or numbness. Medical Treatment for HIV and AIDS Advances have been made in medical treatment for HIV/AIDS. Different combinations of medications that block the replication of the virus can help to slow the progression of HIV in the body. This type of drug therapy for HIV used to be called HAART, short for \"highly active antiretroviral therapy.\" Now, it is usually referred to as ART or cART, which stands for \"combination antiretroviral therapy.\" This form of treatment for HIV can increase chances of survival and quality of life, but is not well-tolerated by all patients. Lifelong use of the medication is required, which, for some, makes HIV a manageable chronic illness. For other patients, the side effects of cART may not be tolerable. Side effects of HIV medications can involve [gastric problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. Medications can cause liver dysfunction, damage to the liver, and bone marrow suppression, meaning fewer blood cells are being made by the bone marrow. While a person is still in the asymptomatic phase of HIV, doctors may not begin using [antiretroviral therapy](https://www.verywellhealth.com/cart-hiv-combination-antiretroviral-therapy-48921) because of concerns related to side effects and resistance. However, taking some steps to optimize immune function can potentially help stave off progression into symptomatic and AIDS stages. TCM herbs and acupuncture can be helpful during this phase to help strengthen the immune system and hopefully slow down the progression of disease. Acupuncture and herbal treatment with TCM may also be used as an adjunct therapy during later phases in order to help people tolerate cART better by reducing nausea and other gastrointestinal effects of the medication and helping to improve appetite. For patients with HIV, TCM treatment is designed to help strengthen the body's immune defenses in the hopes of preventing advancement to the AIDS stage of disease. For patients in the AIDS stage, TCM treatment focuses on helping to alleviate symptoms of opportunistic infections and to mitigate the side effects of other medications. TCM for HIV/AIDS What is HIV from the TCM perspective? TCM puts a lot of emphasis on the prevention of disease by maintaining a balance of yin and yang energies in order to protect the body's Vital Qi. It is Vital Qi that keeps invasive illnesses like viruses from getting into the body and taking hold there. There are no TCM historical records that point specifically to AIDS, but we do have centuries of practice treating various kinds of invasive viral infections. Modern TCM practitioners apply this knowledge when treating patients with HIV/AIDS. [Syndrome factors](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21906520/) of HIV according to TCM: - Qi deficiency - Blood deficiency - Yin deficiency - Yang deficiency - Phlegm - Dampness - Qi stagnation - Essence deficiency An invasion of heat causes the early symptoms of HIV infection: fever, itching (pruritis), and fatigue. Then, later on, as the virus moves deeper into the body, toxic heat causes problems with the organ systems of the stomach, spleen, kidneys, and liver that lead to the weight loss and poor appetite indicative of later stages of HIV and AIDS. Herbal formulations can help relieve the diarrhea that is often reported by patients with AIDS/HIV. [Herbs](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Acupuncture+and+HIV+Living+Well+with+HIV) that work to help strengthen the spleen can improve fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, diarrhea, and skin rash. Strengthening deficient Qi is central to [ TCM treatment for HIV](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00974454) and can help to improve immune responses in the body. Chinese herbal formulations can aid in reducing the spread of the infection with results similar to those of cART medicines, while simultaneously having a positive effect on the immune system overall. Herbs do not come with the negative side effects associated with drug therapy for HIV/AIDS. In addition to the other immune-related problems, people living with HIV/AIDS are also likely to have systemic [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012895/). HIV can cause damage and inflammation in the gut, and cause blood clotting, making people more susceptible to cardiovascular problems and heart disease. Acupuncture [has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398958/) to help reduce systemic inflammation in HIV patients. [Some studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21695615/) have suggested that herbs may help AIDS patients to live longer, and improve chances of long-term survival. Treatment of HIV with acupuncture and herbs can help to relieve symptoms and reduce the side effects of other treatments. Acupuncture Near Me for HIV/AIDS in the Los Angeles Area If you or someone you love is living with HIV, getting the best care possible as soon as possible is vital for improving the long-term outcome. Putting together a program of complementary health care for HIV/AIDS can help offer the best chances for survival, quality of life, and peace of mind. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Hepatitis With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hepatitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine-these are possible signs of Hepatitis infection, although many people infected with Hepatitis show no symptoms. For some people, a Hepatitis B or [Hepatitis C infection](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-c) goes away on its own, but in other cases, it can cause serious liver damage, leading to chronic liver disease. Acupuncture and TCM treatment, including Chinese herbs, offer a way to [help improve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229916300759) liver function and reduce symptoms of Hepatitis. There are several variants of the Hepatitis virus that can cause inflammation of the liver, leading to scarring (liver cirrhosis or liver fibrosis), and in some cases leading to chronic liver problems or liver cancer. Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hep C (HCV) are the types of infection that can lead to long-term illness and even liver failure. It is estimated that over [300 million people worldwide](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1) are living with the effects of HBV or HCV infections. There is a vaccination that offers protection against Hepatitis B and Hepatitis A, but there is no vaccine for Hepatitis types C, D, and E. People who have contracted Hepatitis A or an acute form of HBV are usually told to rest and drink lots of fluids. Medical treatment for chronic Hepatitis that lasts for more than six months usually involves antiviral medications that help slow down the spread of the virus through the body. [TCM treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22083981/) for Hepatitis with acupuncture and herbs works to [improve the function of the liver](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-detox-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and related organs (spleen, kidneys, gallbladder) and to strengthen the immune system so that the body can overcome the effects of the Hepatitis virus. What Causes Hepatitis? There are currently five different types of Hepatitis infection, referred to as: Hepatitis A, [Hepatitis B virus (HBV)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802), Hepatitis C (HCV or Hep C), Hepatitis D, and Hepatitis E. All of these viral infections affect the liver, causing inflammation and possibly scarring, known as cirrhosis of the liver or fibrosis of the liver. Hepatitis A and E viruses are carried in contaminated water or food supplies. People might contract the Hep A or Hep E virus through eating something like raw shellfish that was in contaminated water, or eating food prepared by a worker who did not wash their hands properly. These variants of Hepatitis may cause an acute infection, but do not lead to chronic conditions. [HBV](https://www.hepb.org/what-is-hepatitis-b/the-abcs-of-viral-hepatitis/) and HCV are spread through bodily fluids like blood and semen, and can therefore be spread through sexual contact, or the sharing of needles, or a woman may pass the infection to her baby during birth. Hepatitis is a common co-infection in [people living with HIV/AIDS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hiv-aids-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). People with [Cystic Fibrosis (CF)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-cystic-fibrosis-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) can also be more prone to infections and liver problems. These more serious forms of Hepatitis can lead to chronic illness, including cancer of the liver, or liver failure, making it one of the primary reasons people end up having a liver transplant. Top 10 Symptoms of Hepatitis Symptoms of a HBV or Hepatitis C infection often do not show up for a few weeks, a few months, or in some cases, years later. Some people, especially children, do not feel any symptoms of Hepatitis. The most common Hepatitis symptoms include: - Abdominal pain, pain in right side - Swelling in liver area, swollen belly (ascites - fluid buildup in the liver) - Jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin - Dark urine, pee is dark - Light colored stools, poop is clay-colored - Fatigue - Nausea - Fever - Loss of appetite - Joint pain Bleeding easily or bruising easily are also potentially [signs of Hep C](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/hepatitis-c-skin-problems), as is a skin rash, or itchy skin (pruritus), little blisters, or itchy patches of skin like psoriasis. Some people have a sensation of their internal organs itching. What Is the Treatment for Hepatitis? If a person shows high levels of liver enzymes and still has the Hepatitis B virus in their body after six months or more, they will often be prescribed medications aimed to slow the spread of the virus and prevent further damage to the liver. There are several types of [antiviral medications](https://www.hepb.org/treatment-and-management/treatment/approved-drugs-for-adults/) used to treat patients with long-term effects of Hepatitis, some of them are pills (adefovir, entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir) that are taken daily for a year, or for several years. Some, known as Interferons, are given as an injection a few times a week over the course of several months or more. These medications can slow the virus in some patients, but for some people, they may not do much to protect the body from liver damage or stop the virus from spreading. These medications can cause serious side effects, including headaches, dizziness, fever, and severe depression. Acupuncture and TCM methods offer an alternative or adjunct support to help promote better liver function and boost the body's defense against the Hepatitis virus. What Acupuncture and TCM Can Do for Hepatitis Hepatitis infection is closely associated with the liver, as it is the liver that shows the most obvious damage as a result of infection, often resulting in cirrhosis or scarring of the liver. But according to TCM philosophy, the other internal organs work in concert with the liver, helping it to do the job of cleaning the blood and supplying it to the rest of the body. Patients with chronic Hepatitis B infection will demonstrate symptoms that help the acupuncture practitioner recognize a particular syndrome pattern, allowing them to use acupuncture points and Chinese herbs to work on deficiencies in the liver and other organs. In [TCM theory, Hepatitis](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Chinese+Traditional+Medicine+for+Hepatitis+C) infection occurs due to pathogenic forces of toxic Heat and Dampness invading the body. The infection moves through different stages, and the TCM provider will tailor treatment with herbs, acupuncture, and moxibustion to the [stage of infection](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2018/7482593/) and specific pattern of symptoms. TCM differentiations of Hepatitis include: - Liver Qi stagnation - causes symptoms like nausea, poor appetite, distension of the belly or [bloated stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Spleen and/or Kidney Yang deficiency - associated with poor appetite, loose stools, sallow complexion, weakness, loss of muscle - Liver - Gallbladder Dampness and Heat - causes jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), fever, nausea - Liver - Kidney Yin Deficiency - indicated (tinnitus)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/) - Blood stasis - accumulation of blood in the liver contributes to fibrosis or cirrhosis, also causes pain in the lower rib area, [menstrual problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [PMS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). A person may be more susceptible to getting Hepatitis because of some underlying deficiencies in their Qi, and/or the virus may cause those deficiencies to manifest. The main goal of acupuncture treatment for HBV or HCV, therefore, is to strengthen the liver, spleen, and kidneys, to clear any dampness or excess heat from these organs, and to increase the circulation of blood through the systems. Traditional Chinese herb formulations have been shown in [clinical trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229916300759) to help improve liver function in patients with chronic Hepatitis B. [Herbs that help](https://www.asiabiotech.com/01/0105/0124_0124.pdf) improve spleen function are believed to help rid the body of the virus and allow for healing of the liver. Diet and nutrition are, naturally, also very important in helping to strengthen and detoxify the liver and other organs. Your TCM practitioner will go far beyond the usual advice (drink fluids, avoid alcohol), and will give you specific advice for a [hepatitis diet](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Acupuncture+and+Diet+for+Hepatitis+B) plan. Acupuncture Near Me for Hepatitis in West LA Chronic Hepatitis B and Hep C infections can be difficult to treat. Using acupuncture and herbs as an adjunct to conventional antiviral therapy for HBV may help to prevent further damage to the liver and improve organ function so that patients can recover from a chronic viral infection more fully. At Art of Wellness, we have over 30 years of experience providing integrative care for those suffering from chronic illnesses of all kinds. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat PMS With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., swings, [bloated stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and weight gain. Why is PMS so bad? [Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20376780) is a set of symptoms that occur in the days before a woman gets her period. PMS symptoms affect every woman differently, and can be serious enough to disrupt your life every month. TCM is an effective way to deal with PMS, because [acupuncture treatment can help](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005290.pub2/full) relieve both physical and emotional symptoms of PMS and severe PMS, also known as [PMDD](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd) (premenstrual dysphoric disorder). To say that PMS is common among women is an understatement. The vast majority of women experience some changes in both their mental health and their bodies the week before their period starts. Whether or not a woman feels that it has a negative impact on her daily life may change over time. For some women, PMS isn't a big deal; for others, it's a major problem that can affect their relationships, impact their work, and make life hell every month. Most women find their own particular pattern of PMS is somewhat predictable-until it isn't. One of the most frustrating aspects of menstrual problems is the sense that things change without warning, and symptoms can come on suddenly with ferocious intensity. It can be difficult to describe how you feel before your period, because the symptoms seem to come and go. Some women find that their PMS symptoms are different from month to month. In some cases, they might find that every other month is bad, while the alternating months aren't so bad. Why is PMS worse some months? Other than the basic understanding that PMS is caused by fluctuations in hormones and brain chemistry, conventional medical science does not offer much in the way of clear answers about what causes PMS. TCM provides a different framework for looking at menstrual problems and has been used to treat women's health issues of all kinds for many centuries. [TCM treatments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6513602/) including acupuncture, acupressure, moxibustion, and Chinese herbs can not only help relieve PMS symptoms, they can also be beneficial for other menstrual problems like [irregular periods, PCOS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [painful periods, endometriosis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [heavy periods, fibroids](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and symptoms of [perimenopause](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menopause-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Top 10 Symptoms of PMS As a syndrome, [PMS](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/premenstrual-syndrome) is considered a collection of symptoms that often appear together, in various combinations in different individuals. In the case of PMS, a woman may feel that her own symptoms change as often as every month, or gradually over the course of years. Girls in their teenage years may experience PMS in one way. Then, a woman in her early adult years may develop a different set of symptoms. After having a baby, a woman may find that her PMS symptoms have changed again. Then, many women in middle age experience changes in PMS symptoms as they go through perimenopause, approaching menopause. The most common signs of premenstrual syndrome include: - Mood swings, low mood, feelings of sadness or anger - Anxiety, feeling tense and irritable, cry easily or lose temper, want to be left alone - Trouble sleeping, insomnia, disturbed sleep - Breast tenderness, sore breasts, swollen breasts - Food cravings, changes in appetite - Weight gain, stomach bloating, water retention, pelvic pressure - Gassiness, changes in digestion and elimination [Acne](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acne-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), skin problems - Changes in libido - Headaches, migraines, difficulty concentrating, foggy head Less obvious or well-known symptoms of PMS include: [vision problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-glaucoma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [tingling in the arms or legs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), lack coordination (clumsiness, dropping things), bruising easily, [heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and increased [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Other health problems can be amplified during the premenstrual [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and anxiety disorders. The physical and emotional aspects of PMS can affect each other, causing the typical mood swings. Feelings of sadness and frustration, or lack of sleep, may lead to comfort eating, but then the sight and sensation of your bloated stomach can cause you to feel depressed about your body. Minor problems with your spouse or co-workers can suddenly seem overwhelming and make you feel angry or helpless. For some women, PMS symptoms are so bad that they feel unable to function the week before their period. Severe PMS is now diagnosed as [PMDD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/expert-answers/pmdd/faq-20058315). What Is PMDD? PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) is a severe form of PMS marked by intense emotional symptoms that dramatically impact a woman's life, in addition to physical symptoms. \"Dysphoria\" is the opposite of \"euphoria;\" in other words, it is a mental state characterized by profound unhappiness and negative feelings. It is estimated that about 5% of all women experience this extreme type of PMS. Signs of PMDD include: [Severe anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), paranoia - Severe depression, in some cases even suicidal thoughts, lack of self-worth - Anger and irritability that provokes rage and causes conflicts with other people - Fatigue, low energy, [inability to concentrate](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), feelings of confusion - Intense food cravings, possibly leading to binge eating Again, there is currently no scientific answer for what causes [PMDD](https://iapmd.org/about-pmdd), although it is generally believed to be related to the way estrogen levels and progesterone levels change between ovulation and the onset of the menstrual period. Mood is considered to be related to serotonin levels in the brain, and this is why [PMDD](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd) is usually treated with birth control pills, which suppress ovulation, and/or antidepressants (SSRIs), which affect serotonin uptake. Medical Treatment for PMS Naturally, when a woman asks for advice about PMS or PMDD, she is going to hear suggestions like: \"try meditating, exercise more, eat a healthy diet, and get more sleep.\" And it is true that making good lifestyle choices is an important part of helping to reduce PMS symptoms. But women who are suffering with serious PMS need solutions beyond these kinds of lifestyle guidelines. When women complain of PMS symptoms, [doctors](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20376787) will most often recommend OTC pain medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen (NSAIDs) to relieve pain. Diuretics may be used to relieve bloating or premenstrual weight gain. Of course, most commonly, women are prescribed oral birth control pills, which suppress ovulation, and therefore may reduce the severity of PMS symptoms. More and more frequently, women may be prescribed antidepressants to try to deal with emotional symptoms and mood swings, or anxiety medications to take as needed during PMS. In effect, doctors often treat PMS the same way they would depression or anxiety. Clearly, birth control pills are not helpful for women who may want to get pregnant, and some women may be concerned about how taking the pill or antidepressants may affect their fertility in the future. None of these pharmacological solutions for PMS address the root cause of the symptoms, and all of these medications carry side effects that may impact a woman's overall health. Health care for women with [TCM seeks to address](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2015/01/25/the-pms-relief-you've-been-looking-for-traditional-chinese-herbs-and-acupuncture) the deeper internal causes of hormonal imbalances and other problems with the organ systems that are impacting the health of the ovaries and the regularity of the menstrual cycle. Can Acupuncture Help PMS? While it is only in recent years that conventional medicine has begun to acknowledge connections between physical health and emotional health, TCM has understood for many hundreds of years that health conditions of all kinds, especially those related to the menstrual cycle, are rooted in the balance of energies. Menstruation represents an ongoing process of transformation that occurs not only within the reproductive organs, but which affects every part of a woman, and even the people around her. The concept of Yin and Yang in Chinese philosophy describes two opposing yet complementary forces that are constantly acting upon each other in order to achieve balance. The menstrual cycle is very much based on Yin and Yang energies; during the follicular phase of the cycle (before ovulation), Yin is increasing while Yang is decreasing, and in the luteal phase (after ovulation, before the period), Yang is increasing while Yin is decreasing. The system is designed, naturally, to create the right conditions for conception; this process of Yin and Yang exchange is what determines a [woman's fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). While the health of the uterus and ovaries is definitely central to the process, within the TCM philosophy, they are not the only organs involved with menstruation. The Kidneys, Liver, and Heart all have important roles to play, as well. In TCM, we also view the elements of Fire-to provide warmth, controlled by the Heart-and Water, controlled by the Kidneys-to provide moisture, as being vital to all processes within the body, especially to menstruation. Blood is cleansed, stored, and then distributed to the other organs by the Liver. Blood being central to the process of menstruation, the Liver's role is really key in how the whole thing plays out. According to TCM theory, most PMS and PMDD symptoms are caused by problems with Liver Qi. When the Liver Qi is out of balance, it can lead to feelings of anger, frustration, depression, and irritability. The Liver system is particularly susceptible to negative [effects of stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). There are a few [different variations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5494079/) of Liver Qi imbalance and other patterns that can contribute to PMS symptoms: - Liver Qi invasion - This is a condition of excess, in which there is too much rising Liver Qi, characterized by overall negative emotions that are disruptive, including anger and anxiety, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, and constipation. - Liver Qi depression - In this case, there is not enough Liver Qi, causing feelings of sadness, heaviness in chest, painful swelling of breasts, sighing, bloated stomach, lack of appetite, cramping during period, scanty blood during period. - Spleen Kidney deficiency - In this case, stagnant energy in the Kidney system is preventing water from moving appropriately, causing water retention or edema. From the scientific medical standpoint, acupuncture treatment has been shown to have a positive effect on neurotransmitters like serotonin, and to impact levels of estrogen and progesterone. This happens naturally because we are using TCM methods to restore optimal function of all the organs. With Chinese herbs we are able to get specific nutrients into the body that we cannot get from the foods we normally eat. Acupuncture treatment accompanied with [specific herbs for PMS](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006414.pub2/abstract) patterns can help balance the liver Qi, and bring all of the organs into synergistic harmony. In order to make lasting change, it is best to have acupuncture treatment at least once or twice a week. We need to deal with [each phase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6614973/) of the menstrual cycle as it occurs by tailoring the acupuncture treatment and herbs to your PMS and period symptoms. A [systematic review](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.02994.x) of ten controlled trials using acupuncture to treat PMS concluded that TCM treatment of PMS significantly improved symptoms. Top 3 Tips for PMS Relief From TCM Perspective There are still a lot of taboos surrounding women's health, and many girls and women have never learned how to take care of their reproductive health. Working with an experienced TCM doctor will enable you to get personalized care and advice about how to eat the best diet for PMS symptoms, what activities to avoid before your period, and other female hygiene tips that you may not have heard before. - Nutrition - conventional Western thinking about healthy eating currently focuses on eating fresh, whole foods, which is good, except that people tend to think this means eating a lot of foods raw or cold, as in salads and smoothies. According to the TCM philosophy of nutrition, though, eating cold foods is actually one of the worst things you can do when it comes to relieving PMS and painful periods. Putting a lot of cold food into the stomach cools down the temperature of the other internal organs, which can contribute to more cramping and worse cramps. During the week before your period, concentrate on eating plenty of nourishing, cooked foods like soups and stews, proteins and vegetables, and whole grains like brown rice and quinoa. Avoid too much dairy, sugar, caffeine, hot, spicy or fried foods (that includes chips and crackers), and definitely avoid icy cold beverages and frozen treats. - Keep track of your period - there are many apps available now to help with this, but it can also be a simple chart with room for notes about your symptoms. Keeping track of your PMS symptoms every month can help you recognize patterns in your own behaviors and experiences. A record of PMS symptoms will also help you communicate what you're feeling to your health care providers when you are seeking treatment for PMS or PMDD. - Exercise - gentle movement modalities that move Qi through the body are great to help PMS: Tai Qi, yoga, or dancing are all good. Avoid deep twists that could squeeze or put pressure on the ovaries and other organs. Again, keep track of your exercise routines and how they affect your physical and emotional wellbeing from month to month so that you can see which type of workout is best for you, or if some types of exercise make PMS worse.
