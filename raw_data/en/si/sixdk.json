History of Medicine chronologically traces its development from guesswork about theactions ofprehistoric Manthrough thecenturies tosome centres oftheworld have moved over time totimefromplace toplace, Not only have they dominated socially, economically, politically and militarily, they hava alsocarried the arts, sciences, humanities and philosophies withthem, whether tohave progressed anintellectual climate which andsustains, arid isexemplified, inseveral fields, with ideas crossing andre-crossing boundaries between subjects. In earlier times allknowledge was part ofaconglomerate which one polymath UK. 42 These omnicompetents, often thought ofasphilosophers, moved easily from speculation topracticality. from artto science existence This shows one ofthe historically persistent patterns inthe move from generalization :0speciali- zation over10ng periods oftime. ThePast: Tigris and Euphrates, ancient Egypt (3000-~00 BC)andChina. Archeologists have found out that priest doctors in;l ancient India used spells, herbs and spices tocure diseases Surgeon Susruta (400 AD) listed about 100 surgical tools. Indian Ayurvedic medicine as described inAtharvaveda dates asfar back assecond millennium BC. The golden ageofIndian medicine when \"Caraka-Semhita\" and \"Susruta- Sarnhita\" were compiled respectively byCaraka-a physician andSu-iruta -a surgeon dates between 800BCand 1000 AD.

Butthere was aflicker oflight even inthat Dark Ages, Inmid900's a famous medical school hadgrown up atSalerno thirty miles south of Naples inItaly. Men andwomen of allraces were trained asdoctors places in Frar~ce, Spain and Switzerland. Medical school at Salerno trained firstgroup of\"women doctors\" during tenth andeleventh centuries, inmodern medicine was anArnericari- Paris School ofMedicine in1870 as University would have allowed her tostudy \"Medicine\" inthose days. First British lady doctor (not auniversity graduate) was Elizabeth Garett Anderson (1836-1917) granted a licence in1865 bytheSociety of 1880) trained continued herfurther medical education inEdinburgh. Itisinteresting tonote that, in contrast tothe Christian belief on human health anddisease during the Dark Ages (400-1100 AD). theHoly Koran encouraged the study of medicine: \"0servant ofGod, use medicine because God hath not created apain without aremedy for it.' Hence, the Arabian physicians kept the flag ofGreek medicine flying. 44 THE RENAISSANCE (NEWTON'S CENTURY) (1500-1700 AD) : The yoke ofScholasticism on medicine began tobethrown offwith theRenaissance around thefifteenth century. This was essentially based innorthern Italy, and saw the beginnings ofsound observational anatomy. The realscientific erahad then begun. Theintellectual spirit of the Renaissance spread throughout Europe and especially northwards to Paris, Holland and England, aswell asintoSwitzerland andGermany and the Scandinavian countr ies. And early seventeenth century William was result of observation, inference and most significantly experiment, sothat another dimension was added to medical advance.. later in the seventeenth century Isaac Newton (1642-1727) revolutionized. the whole way oflooking atthephysical world. with profound consequences for natural science, including medicine. CENTURY OFENLIGHTENMENT: The eighteenth century brought furiher advances, especially in midwifery with the careful recording, inference, hypothesis and experiment hadbeen learned from the pioneers andwere being applied ina variety ofdirections andsubjects. many others. The French Revolution in 1789 (July 14) totally reshaped medicine. Within three tumultuous decades much ofwhat wenow take forgranted hadbecome such asPierre Jean-Georges Cabanis and Phillipe Pinel both members of French National Assembly wanted toapply the new philosophy to studying disease. In the first National Assembly after theFrench Revolution, 28oritsmembers were doctors; the equivalent number inlater concept Medicine Th:ough The Ages Maiumdar CENTURY OFEVOLUTION (DARWIN'S) : The nineteenth century was dominated byCharles Darwin (1809- 1882) who changed the way of looking atthe living world, just as Newton had done forthepi.vsic al world. Itisimpossible toestimate just how much these two have brought about inthe later working outoftheir ideas. experiments and speculations. Butthelater nineteenth century saw the beginnings of bacteriology andofcellular pathology, and bythe turn ofthe century psychiatry largeiy asa result ofthework ofSigmund Freud (1856-1939) theageofspecialization knowledge anditsapplications have burgeoned About the middle of thecentury came the therapeutic explosion based on increasingly rational pharmacy andtheapplication ofphysics and chemistry andother sciences almost imperceptibly. Ideas and actions, consonant with their times, arise and diffuse, and thereafter may flourish, stagnate, die orlietorpidly until awakened once more when thetime isripe.45 Thegeneral course ofthehistory of medicine IS from massive speculation-without allowing ittobe much influenced byfact, asobserved or derived from experiment-to narrower and narrower smaller hypotheses, potentially testable by observation and experime nt. There isamove too from supernatural to natural explanations ofphenomena: anditalltakes avery long time. with theoldclinging tothenew, impeding itsprogress and having to be discarded astime passes, sothat novel andfruitful ways oflooking at events may emerge andbetested. In short, medicine isoneaspect ofthe development ofscientific method being applied inone ofthemost difficult areas ofnature Formedicine has little practice. Itmust beapractical art, orscience, orboth. Inslightly more specific terms the mind concerned with medicine firstspeculates about aproblem. then tries tosolve itempirically with the tools available atthe time. Inthe earliest times these tools could only besome modifications ofthe diet, bathing, restandsleep, with perhaps some potions ofdoubtful value. In investigations too, asfarasthese were undertaken, there was little at hand that could beused. Butthen there may come technological advances, perhaps outside medicine, which may beapplicable within it.
