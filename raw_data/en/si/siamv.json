Unfortunately, some of the best supplements for immune system support, such as echinacea, vitamin C, zinc, elderberry, probiotics, and vitamin D, are in high demand, and at times, even difficult to find. However, there are many alternative natural ingredients that can be effectively used to fight off pathogens, support immunity, and treat symptoms of respiratory tract infections. This article provides a high-level overview of respiratory tract infections, and several alternative natural supplements for immune system support that can be used to combat respiratory tract infections. These ingredients can support various pathological mechanisms that either combat pathological infection, or reduce the host's physiological response to infection to ultimately reduce the severity of respiratory tract symptoms. Please note that there are many more ingredients that can be used for immune and respiratory support that are not currently included in this article. Future editions will provide additional information on ingredients not currently covered in this version. Pathogenesis and pathophysiology of respiratory tract infections There are several origins (pathogenesis) and physiological outcomes (pathophysiology) related to respiratory tract infections. Viruses are one of the most common causes of respiratory tract infections. The human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and other viruses can result in respiratory infection in infect individuals of all health and age statuses. They may lead to a variety of acute airway conditions, or other disorders such as asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the common cold, the flu, or pneumonia to name a few. ( [72](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28283855)) Respiratory tract infections are not only caused by viruses, however. Bacterial colonization is another means by which both upper respiratory infection and lower respiratory infection may occur. ( [91](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26488280)) Most commonly, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the in respiratory tract infections. ( [6](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003057)) The body's response to the presence of pathogens like viruses or bacteria can lead to an overstimulation of the inflammatory response and immune system. The host's immune and inflammatory hyper-response can cause a prolonged or more severe reaction to infection, leading to increased prevalence of symptoms associated with infection such as chills, coryza, cough, fever, headaches, myalgia, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, sneezing, sore throat, sputum production, wheezing, and occasional gastrointestinal complications such as nausea or vomiting. These symptoms typically depend on the specific pathogen and can ultimately lead to the damaging of respiratory tract damage. ( [66](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26965109)) Two of the most well known causes of respiratory tract infections involve viruses that cause the common cold and influenza. Several symptoms of cold and flu respiratory system infections are shown below. Alternative ingredients for immune system and respiratory system support Numerous ingredients provide a variety of pharmacological actions that may physiologically increase the body's ability to fight off pathogens that cause symptoms of the respiratory tract, or the development of more severe respiratory conditions. These ingredients can also provide relief from the symptoms associated with infections of the respiratory tract. For reference, the [American Botanical Council (ABC)](http://abc.herbalgram.org/site/PageServer), one of the leading sources for information on botanical and alternative medicine, has amassed terminology related to natural ingredient actions and their properties. The terms that apply to the mechanistic uses of natural ingredients relating to the counteraction of respiratory pathogens and the reduction of symptoms caused by respiratory tract infections are summarized here: [Anti-catarrhal](#1): reduces head and throat mucosal inflammation [Anti-inflammatory](#2): reduces inflammation in response to infection [Anti-microbial](#3): opposes microbes (eg. bacteria, viruses) [Anti-spasmodic](#4): reduces bronchi/upper lung spasms or constriction to improve breathing [Anti-tussive](#5): stops or reduces cough [Demulcent](#6): polysaccharide-rich ingredients to cover and alleviate inflamed mucous induces sweating reduces fever ( [3](http://abc.herbalgram.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Terminology)) The following figure summarizes some of the main uses of several natural ingredients and their main mechanistic applications in immunity and respiratory support. The main uses were selected based on a mix of available human, in vivo and in vitro evidence, and/or a history of reported traditional use in respiratory conditions. The table at the end of this article presents more detail on the evidence supporting the main uses of these ingredients. Disclaimer: The ingredients listed below and in the diagram are categorized based on a main mechanism of action within the respiratory system. However, they may have more than one application within and outside of the respiratory system. The main actions were selected based on a combination of available evidence and based on knowledge obtained from the ingredient's traditional history of medicinal use as reviewed by Fullscript's Integrative Medical Advisory Team. For an explanation of the classes of evidence as shown below (A, B, C, D, E, and F), please see the [Rating Scales for Evidence-Based Decision Support](https://fullscript.com/blog/evidence-based-decision-support).
