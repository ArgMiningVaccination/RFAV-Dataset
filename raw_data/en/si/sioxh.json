This practice has, since, gained the attention of scholars globally, with the greatest surge in interest seen in the last two decades.

There is, therefore, an overwhelming need to draw public attention towards the practice and what it can offer African healthcare systems.

It achieves this aim by discussing the major reported positive and negative physiological effects of the practice; its application in the therapy of some common physical and mental disease/illness conditions; its benefits to healthcare workers and students, and informal caregivers; its limitations; the popular criticisms levelled against it; and factors in support and against its incorporation into African healthcare systems.
