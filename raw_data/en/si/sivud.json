What... in... hell????? Lock them and throw the key into the deepest abyss in the ocean. Even as they face charges, it's clear none of this people will ever be the head of an ethical organization. These heartless criminals must never be allowed to bear arms or gain a leg up on the competition again. The gall, truly. It's nuts. Yeah, the headline had thoughts of organ theft from living people, or murder for the purpose of selling the body parts, running though my brain. While this is certainly a horrid crime, at least the people whose parts were sold died of unrelated things before the sale.I thought it would be about live-organ peddling, thankfully not.

In this case, the remains belong to Harvard Medical School and other organizations, but were stolen by the defendants.Serious question: how does ownership of body parts and organs (of cadavers) work? Dead people don't have property rights, as I understand it. I've opted in to organ donation on my driver's license, so when I kick it, who gains title to my kidneys? I was thinking Toadies' \"Jigsaw Girl\".It's not the same thing, but when I saw the headline I was reminded of the Larry Niven story The Patchwork Girl. A part of me thinks \"and eye for an eye\" (literally!) punishment would be appropriate. I won't, but thank you for not expressly stating what it is. Someone here on Ars recently called out an extraordinary animal cruelty video as available on Twitter and the image has been horribly stuck in my head for days.Yes.

That's it mister, go to your room and think about what you've done. I don't want to see you here until you're ready to apologize. Correct, the bodies at the Arkansas mortuary belonged to the families, the ones at Harvard Medical School's morgue belonged to HMS, since those had been donated to them for science.Not a mortician or anything, but I believe the body belongs to the family of the deceased, unless there's something like \"donating body to science\". If the body isn't \"claimed\" I guess it technically belongs to the morgue/city... Funerary practices have never been about the dead. It's about those still alive. No, the dead don't care, but the living descendants do.To be fair, the previous owners really weren't using those parts anymore. I believe your body is on loan from your estate. It must be technically returned to the family after X years. Well for whole body medical research anyway . Don't know about organ donation.Serious question: how does ownership of body parts and organs (of cadavers) work? Dead people don't have property rights, as I understand it.

Henrietta Lacks was an African American woman whose cancer cells were taken in 1951 without her or her family's permission and used to generate the HeLa cell line - the world's first immortalised human cell line. Lacks was diagnosed with cervical cancer and died from the disease at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1951. During her treatment, samples were taken from her cervix without her knowledge or consent and given to George Gey, a doctor and researcher at the hospital. HeLa cellsNormally, human cells can only divide and multiply a [limited number of times]and nobody had yet been able to keep human cells alive for long periods outside the body. But when Gey and his team isolated cancer cells from Lacks's samples and cultured them in the laboratory, they discovered that the cells were immortal - meaning that they could be propagated indefinitely. Lacks's cells, named HeLa after the first two letters of her first and last names, would go on to revolutionise medical research. At present, HeLa cells can be found by the trillions in virtually every biomedical research laboratory in the world. There are thousands of patents involving the cells. Use of HeLa cells in research has contributed to numerous medical breakthroughs, from the development of life-saving vaccines - including [against polio]and the [human papillomavirus], which causes cervical cancer - to the understanding of how [HIV]causes disease. HeLa cells have even been used in research investigating the [effects on human cells of microgravity]. Not any more, except with informed consent of the family. It didn't work out well for the company doing it, either:Also, something to be aware of: when you donate your body, there's no guarantee what type of \"science\" it will be used for. Apparently, corpses are regularly used to test firearms and explosive devices (e.g. missiles). Was hoping for a punderful article from Her Moleness... e.g., \"they were caught red-handed, so their defense is left without a leg to stand on.\"Even as they face charges, it's clear none of this people will ever be the head of an ethical organization.

While this is as interesting as it is disturbing, this feels like an inapt comparison.See also [Henrietta Lacks] Funerary practices have never been about the dead. It's about those still alive. No, the dead don't care, but the living descendants do. As an artist, even one that deals with the macabre, this is just not right. It's common to use (fake) anatomical models to study anatomy for art, but to use real body parts especially in the compositions themselves... that's just wrong... so very wrong. Every bit as wrong as previous artistic practices (look up where mummy brown came from :/ ). Bummer. I was hoping for astronomy.... Also, something to be aware of: when you donate your body, there's no guarantee what type of \"science\" it will be used for... It takes intestinal fortitude to string together so many body related puns! That would be in China.I thought it would be about live-organ peddling, thankfully not. "}
