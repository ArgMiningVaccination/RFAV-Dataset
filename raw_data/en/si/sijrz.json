The typical American diet favors processed foods that are high in fat, refined sugar, and salt. Processed foods often contain pesticides and artificial ingredients that can contribute to toxin buildup.3Toxins are everywhere. You are exposed to toxins every single day. In fact, your body produces its own toxins, or waste known as endogenous toxins, simply by functioning. Your body also encounters external (exogenous) toxins, or chemicals made outside of your body. They are in the air you breathe, the food you eat, the water you drink, and the products you touch.1,2 Exposure to these toxins can overburden your system's natural ability to detoxify . 800 167 80KUS Statistics of herbicides used per year 5,6registered for use 4found in adults with no employment-related exposure 7MILLION+ POUNDSCHEMICALSINDUSTRIAL CHEMICALSToxins can contribute to: Fatigue or difficulty sleeping Indigestion and other temporary gastrointestinal upset Food cravings and weight gain Reduced mental clarity Low libido Skin issues Joint discomfort 1.

This three-phase process unlocks fat-soluble toxins and converts them to a water-soluble state that is easier for your body to remove. Your body needs key nutrients and phytonutrients to support each of these phases. 8. Cline JC, \"Nutritional Aspects of Detoxication in Clinical Practi ce,\" Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine 21, no. 3 (2015): 54-62, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26026145.INTRO TO TOXINS1 Metabolic Detoxication* These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administrat ion.

It also supplies antioxidants that reduce stress on your body, such as tissue damage sometimes caused by these enzyme activities.Your SP Detox Balance program supplies key nutrients and amino acids needed to support Phase ll enzymes. These enzymes enhance the water solubility of toxins.Your SP Detox Balance program provides your body with plant-based fiber and water, which aid in toxin elimination. Stored fat-soluble toxins transform into an \"unlocked\" state that is more water-soluble and, in many cases, more toxic than its original form. The highly toxic substances produced in Phase I convert to non-toxic molecules and become even more water-soluble.Water-soluble toxins leave your cells, and your body eliminates them.Phase UnlockMETABOLIC DETOXIFICATION Phase II: Neutralize Phase III: EliminateSP Detox Balance program provides your body with the additional nutritional support it may need to metabolize and expel toxins safely during each of the three phases of metabolic detoxification.*8Prepare for your journey. Before starting your SP Detox Balance program, meet with your health care practitioner to discuss a plan that's right for you. Preparing your body in advance is essential to successful and safe detoxification. Your health care practitioner will check that you have the proper levels of nutrition to support metabolic detoxification, and help you to identify and remove triggers that could impact your journey.GET STARTED2 Preparation9+ + + +Deciencies and magnesium, methylation capacity, gastrointestinal conditions impacting nutrient absorption, estrogen metabolism, or malnutrition.

If so, you will remove foods from your diet and methodically add them back to identify adverse reactions to foods such as dairy, peanuts, eggs, soy, and gluten.9 28-Day vs. 10-Day Program You will discuss the results of your toxicity questionnaire.

Protein provides amino acids to help support detoxification pathways. Your health care practitioner can help you calculate your protein needs, which vary depending on body weight.

Water keeps cells hydrated, helps maintain a healthy balance of body fluids, and most importantly supports the elimination phase of your detoxification.

Page 33 +18 Home Environment Our homes should be a sanctuary\u2014a safe environment where we can thrive, grow, and heal. A general description of each area and what you should be aware of to decrease potential exposures are listed on the next pages. If you have any questions, please speak to your health care professional. You can also go the to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission website at www.cpsc.gov for specific information.Plastic containers should be carefully evaluated. Use glass instead, especially when heating food or putting hot food into a storage container. Some plastics contain phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) that can seep into food when heated. Use a paper towel instead of plastic over food when microwaving. Candles and scented room fresheners are another area of concern. If you burn the wick of a candle and see a black center, this is a lead- centered wick. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the use of lead wicks in 2003, but they can still be found in candles, specifically candles from other countries. The commission has found that lead-core wicks release around five times the amount of lead considered hazardous for children. Make sure your candle label states the wick is lead-free, and use high-quality candles. Also be aware that paraffin candles release soot in the air, and aromatherapy candles may contain synthetic oils that release toxic particles. The best candles to look for include those that are made of soy, vegetable-based waxes, or 100 percent beeswax and have cotton wicks. For aromatherapy, look for candles that use only natural essential oils. 18Home EnvironmentYOUR PROGRAM319 Home Environment Recommendations Many cleaning agents contain various harsh and toxic chemicals. Effective all-natural cleaners include vinegar, lemons, hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and coarse salt. Olive oil can be used to clean wood and gives it a nice glow. Unless a scented product is labeled as having essential oils, it most likely contains synthetic oils and is something you do not want to be inhaling on a daily basis. Fertilizers, pesticides, and similar products contain harsh chemicals and are marked as being very toxic. Breathing in the fumes from these products when using them can expose you to toxins. It is best to check the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website for safety and recommendations on the use of any of these products. Work exposures can come in many forms. Be aware of your exposures, and wear protective masks if you are in a questionable environment. General exposures include any metals used in dentistry, metals used in tattoos, smoking, and the potential for molds in the home due to water exposure. Speak with your health care practitioner if you have any concerns in this area. 1920Welcome to the new you. Congrats! Pat yourself on the back for a job well done.

Trans fats have been shown to raise \"bad\" cholesterol levels and lower \"good\" cholesterol levels. Articial Sweeteners16,17 Artificial sweeteners like saccharin and aspartame are chemicals used to replace sugar. Many foods labeled as sugar-free contain these chemicals. Processed foods that are full of \"empty calories,\" or no nutritional value, are also typical offenders. New evidence suggests that exposure to artificial sweeteners negatively affects gastrointestinal microbiota in humans and animals. Articial Colors or Dyes Artificial colors and dyes are chemicals added to foods to make them look more appetizing by improving their appearance and color uniformity. Some individuals can experience intolerances or allerg ic reactions to artificial color agents, such as yellow dye. Look for natural, color-enhancing alternatives like turmeric, paprika, and saffron . Sodium Sodium is a hidden ingredient in many foods that are processed or prepared in restaurants. Regardless of the type of salt used, adults should only consume 1,500 to 2,300 milligrams per day. Excessive sodium consumption can contribute to poor health and bloat caused by water retention. Try using herbs in place of salt and do not keep the salt shaker on your table. Hidden Sugars Sugars are often disguised in processed foods under names like corn syrup or high-fructose corn syrup, dextrose or crystal dextrose, fruc tose, maltose, lactose, sucrose, glucose, evaporated cane jui ce, and agave nectar. Less processed options like honey, coconut palm sap, and molasses are healthier alternatives but should still be limited.Ingredients to watch for: 16.
