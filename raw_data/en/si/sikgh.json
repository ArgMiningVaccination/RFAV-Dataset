[Answer](https://www.quora.com/How-natural-are-natural-ingredients-in-food-and-beverages/answer/Tero-Isokauppila-1) by [Tero Isokauppila](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tero-Isokauppila-1), Founder of Four Sigmatic, on [Quora](http://www.quora.com): When you see the word \"natural\" on product labels, you might automatically think \"healthy.\" But do we really know what \"natural\" means? Let's look at \"natural\" flavors. The FDA [ defines](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=501.22) \"natural flavor\" as oils, resins, or other extracts derived from natural sources like plants or meat. While a natural flavor must come from natural sources, it doesn't need to come from the fruit itself. When you see a drink made with \"natural banana flavor,\" don't assume that someone blended whole bananas into your bottle. Banana flavor could actually come from the bark or roots of a different plant containing a chemical that tastes similar to bananas. And it takes a lot of processing to make these \"natural\" flavors in your drink bottle. When it comes down to it, natural and artificial flavors aren't all that different from each other. Chemists make natural flavors by extracting chemicals from natural ingredients, while artificial flavors are made by creating the same chemicals synthetically. Both types of flavors are included in the FDA's list of 3,000 chemical food additives they classify as \"GRAS\" or \"Generally Recognized as Safe.\" In other words, \"natural\" ingredients are often just the opposite. Now, after decades of trying to parse confusing product labels, consumers are demanding transparency\u2014they want to know what they're eating and don't always trust labels. At my company, Four Sigmatic, we take care to only use ingredients that are truly real food ingredients. Here's why: The FDA has a pretty loose definition of natural ingredients. The \"natural\" label is kind of a black box\u2014consumers don't know what's in it. An [Environmental Working Group study](https://www.ewg.org/foodscores/content/natural-vs-artificial-flavors) of 80,000 food products revealed that \"natural flavors\" is the fourth most common listed ingredient after only salt, water, and sugar. According to the FDA, this category includes everything from true natural ingredients like essential oils to synthetic chemicals. But people want to know what they're putting in their bodies. That's one reason why today, people trust the word \"natural\" a lot less. They feel like they've been led on by marketers\u2014and they're right. Most brands don't even know what's in the proprietary natural flavor blends they're buying. Nobody in the company bothers to ask the manufacturer, \"Hey, by the way, how do you make that orange flavor? Do you actually squeeze an orange?\" Consumers shouldn't have to wonder about the ingredients in the food and drink products they buy. The cocktail effect of these ingredients is a mystery\u2014but it's probably not good. Many \"natural\" additives have been found to be harmful to health. For example, xantham gum\u2014which is used in everything ranging from wallpaper glue to salad dressing\u2014has been linked to [respiratory](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/apt.12696) and [digestive problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8329363). And the popular thickening agent carrageenan, which is frequently used in vegan food, was [found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1242073/) to be potentially harmful to the digestive tract. But even if some of these ingredients are safe individually, we don't know much about their cumulative effect. A [2014 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ijfs.12606) from the International Journal of Food Science & Technology found that while the risks of residues, additives, and natural toxins are generally low when considered alone, an average meal is likely to contain a cocktail of toxins that might have negative synergistic effects. Simply put, these \"chemical cocktails\" may be more dangerous than we realize. In both studies, the researchers urge the FDA to include interactions between various chemicals when assessing food risk. While the research is still very much in its early stages, health-conscious consumers may not want to take the risk. Real food ingredients bring a whole host of amazing benefits. When you're consuming synthetic ingredients or natural flavors, you're missing out on all the health benefits of the actual food. Take \"natural chocolate flavor,\" for example. While you might think it tastes alright, you're definitely not getting any of the benefits of real chocolate\u2014a [nutrient-dense superfood](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881109106923). [Cacao](https://us.foursigmatic.com/blog/difference-between-cacao-and-cocoa), in particular, is rich in iron, copper, magnesium, zinc, and phosphorus. It even has [more antioxidant properties per 100 grams than apples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4696435/). Same goes for vanilla. Real vanilla is a rich flavor [packed with antioxidant properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17715988). It's even considered to be an aphrodisiac. Natural vanilla flavor, on the other hand, is much cheaper but has none of those benefits\u2014and is often used to hide bitter-tasting flavors from other artificial products. Likewise, if you want a blueberry smoothie, don't buy one with blueberry flavor. Use whole blueberries to get the [antioxidant properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842687/) present in the actual fruit. And why did chocolate, vanilla, and blueberry flavored foods become so popular in the first place? Because people loved eating these foods in their original forms. Then food companies created synthetic versions and they were everywhere. Even though our palates are used to the knock-offs, the real deal is what we actually crave. Since the FDA probably isn't going to revise its definition of \"natural\" anytime soon, change has to come from consumers. Ask your favorite food companies what's in their natural flavors, or why they even use natural flavors in the first place. In the meantime, we'll keep using all real food ingredients with no synthetic flavors, binders, fillers, or carriers. It's only natural.
