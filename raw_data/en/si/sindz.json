Some users become addicted to meth after using it only a few times. When you use crystal meth repeatedly, you may become physically dependent on the drug. That means that if you suddenly stop using it, you will begin to experience withdrawal symptoms. While the withdrawal symptoms of meth are not usually life-threatening, they are extremely uncomfortable and hard to deal with on your own. That is why it is recommended that anyone who is trying to break their addiction to meth start with a medically supervised detoxification program. The withdrawal symptoms that people experience from meth addiction are often the very reason that they have such a hard time staying stopped. Symptoms may be physical, behavioral, or mental, and they can last for days or weeks. What Is Crystal Methamphetamine Abuse and Detoxification? Crystal methamphetamine abuse and addiction have moved through the country, affecting all walks of life because it is cheap and easy to manufacture. It's a highly addictive stimulant that causes high levels of dopamine to be released in the brain, which creates pleasurable and euphoric feelings. Users develop a tolerance to crystal meth quickly, which means they have to use more and more meth to achieve the same feelings they initially felt. Most meth users need help to detox from the drug because it is so addictive in nature. When the high diminishes, and withdrawal symptoms begin, it's very common for users to go right back to using the drug to make themselves feel better. The Effects of Crystal Methamphetamine Abuse on The Body Crystal meth can be used in several different ways. It can be smoked, snorted, or injected directly into a vein. Users will first feel an intense rush and a high feeling that gives them energy and makes them alert. During the period of being high, users may feel like they are aggressively smarter, they may be hyper-focused on meaningless or odd ideas and tasks, and they may become argumentative or even delusional. This is what is known as tweaking, and it can last up to 16-18 hours. While tweaking, most users don't sleep or have any interest in eating. Some of the other negative effects of crystal meth include: - Trouble thinking and confusion - Inability to focus - Problems with memory - Paranoia - Skin sores - Irritability - Outbursts of anger - Lack of coordination - Muscle spasms What Are the Symptoms of Crystal Methamphetamine Detox? While the withdrawal symptoms of crystal methamphetamine aren't usually life-threatening, they are extremely unpleasant. The detox process can be made safer and much more comfortable when it is done in a detox program where symptoms can be monitored medically. The exact length of time detox takes varies from individual to individual, but there are some common symptoms and a typical timeline that they may follow. Crystal methamphetamine has a short half-life, so it acts fast and is metabolized by the body quickly. Withdrawal from crystal meth usually has three stages, acute, post-acute, and protracted abstinence: Acute Withdrawal Symptoms These symptoms are typically experienced within 24 hours of the last use of crystal [meth](https://www.brightfuturerecovery.com/blog/meth-use-on-the-rise-again-in-america-worse-than-before/), and they last for about ten days. They are likely to include physical symptoms like extreme fatigue, dry mouth, muscle and body aches, slowed reaction, increased appetite, jitteriness, body twitches, and slowed movement. Users may also experience emotional and psychological symptoms during this phase, including: - Irritability - Emotional outbursts - Extreme mood swings - Confused thoughts - Intense cravings for meth - Inability to experience pleasure - Unpleasant and vivid dreams Post-Acute Withdrawal Symptoms Post-acute withdrawal symptoms are typically experienced for two to three weeks after the acute stage. During this stage, the acute withdrawal symptoms lessen in severity and intensity. During the weeks of post-acute withdrawal symptoms, people are likely to feel depressed, fatigued, lethargic, and they will likely have intense cravings for crystal meth, and some may have suicidal ideations during this time. Protracted Abstinence Lastly, protracted abstinence is when the emotional and psychological withdrawal symptoms ramp up, and the physical symptoms subside. During this phase, people often experience cravings, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations. These symptoms can persist for weeks or months after the discontinued use of crystal meth, making it a vulnerable time for people that are prone to relapse. How Long Will It Take to Detox from Crystal Meth? There are numerous factors that can affect the length of time it takes to detox from crystal methamphetamines, including: - Length of time using meth - Amount and frequency of meth use - How meth was used (smoked, snorted, injected) - Age and overall health of the person In general terms, the longer you have been using meth, the more severe and longer-lasting the withdrawal symptoms will be. That said, methamphetamines have a short half-life. That means that the drug acts quickly, has a short high, and leaves the body fairly quickly. Withdrawal symptoms typically start within 24 hours of the last use of the drug, peak between one to two weeks, and then gradually subside. However, the psychological and emotional withdrawal symptoms may persist much longer after discontinued use.
