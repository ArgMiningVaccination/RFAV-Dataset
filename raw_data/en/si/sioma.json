This institution was established to implement quality control on pharmaceutical products. The infrastructure and facilities were designed to meet the requirements for testing and quality control activities. Beginning 1985, NPRA was given the task of ensuring the quality, efficacy and safety of pharmaceuticals through the registration and licensing scheme. This is achieved through evaluation of scientific data and laboratory tests on all products before they are marketed. A system to monitor products in the market was set-up. Information on drugs for medical professionals and consumers was made available through a drug information service. The NPRA also handles courses and provides training to drug regulatory personnel from the other countries, for example from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Mongolia and Vietnam. In 1996, NPRA was given an international recognition by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a \"WHO Collaborating Centre for Regulatory Control of Pharmaceuticals\". This recognition is an acknowledgement from WHO for NPRA's contribution in the field of regulatory affairs. | | VISION | | MISSION | | OBJECTIVE |To be an internationally renowned regulatory authority for medicinal products and cosmetics.||To safeguard the nation's health through scientific excellence in the regulatory control of medicinal products and cosmetics.||To ensure that therapeutic substances approved for the local market are safe, effective and of quality and also to ensure that notified cosmetic products are safe and of quality.| 2021 - 2025 Pharmacy Programme "}
