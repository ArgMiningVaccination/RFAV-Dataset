While other summaries have been written for East Asian Medical practitioners, none dive so deeply into treatment strategies from both Zang-Fu/8 Principles patterning and Five Phase theory. Additionally, the information presented on each oil is complete in pharmacological information as well as energetic profiles. For practitioners who are new to aromatherapy, this book will change the way you practice. For those who have already integrated essential oils into their work, this book will add precision to your treatments and provide abundant inspiration.

Dennis interprets oil use in the five phases and eight principles of TCM, delves into specific aspects of mind/body/spirit healing, and educates the reader all inclusively on their use. It is the single best source I've seen and has a very useful, comprehensive index. The 8 page 5 phase essential oil adjunct folder is also very practice friendly and enables the user to confidently ease into combining EO's into specific treatment protocols with a minimal investment in product. Essential oils and Chinese Medicine create a very powerful treatment that is well received by most of my patients. Was this review helpful to you? Browse for more products in the same category "}
