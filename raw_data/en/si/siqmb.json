Toxic substances damage the DNA and other cellular components on the molecular level. Toxins prevent vital nutrients from being properly absorbed by your body. This leads to a serious chemical imbalance in your body systems and may cause tissue and organ damage. The body naturally removes many toxins on its own, but today we are surrounded by such enormous quantities of environmental toxins, that the body may be overwhelmed in its ability to cleanse itself. INTERNAL SOURCES OF TOXINS Detoxification is the process of neutralizing and eliminating toxins from the body. Detoxification works on the cellular level and promotes the body to use its natural healing system to fight disease. Detoxification rids your body of dangerous substances, restores your vitality, and improves your overall health all while nourishing your body with proper nutrients. Detoxification should be done regularly to optimize your health and your body's overall function. Any detoxification treatment should be conducted by an experienced physician who will first evaluate your existing medical condition and run a variety of tests to determine your toxic levels. While many detox products exist, most of them simply do not work, and some could be dangerous to your health. You should consult a detoxification expert to ensure optimal health results and minimize side effects. Detoxification combined with lifestyle modifications such as changes in diet and increased levels of exercise can have a positive impact on your health, improve your quality of life, and help you look better and feel younger. A comprehensive medical approach is needed to optimize your health, renew your energy levels, and restore your body to feel years younger. Detoxification requires a holistic approach if you want to slow down the aging process, stay healthy, and live longer. To request your consultation, [contact us "}
