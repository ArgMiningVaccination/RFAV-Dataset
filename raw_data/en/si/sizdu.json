All of these treatments and many others arecalled complementary or alternative medicine . Traditional medicine considers complementary andalternative medicine (CAM) to beoutside the range of \"proven\"treatments. People use complemen- tary medicine along with what their doctor prescribes. People use alternative medicine instead of what their doctor prescribes. The basis of traditional medicine is that the doctor knows best and thepatient does what the doctor says.The basis of CAM is that patients andhealers work together. Rather thanthe doctor taking full responsibility forthe patient 's health, both share responsibility for the patient 's health and choices. 1,2 CAM's Use & Acceptance One national study compared the use of CAM treatments in 1990 withthose used in 1997. Thirty-threepercent of those surveyed reportedthey used CAM treatments in 1990,while 42 percent reported they usedCAM treatments in 1997. People saidthey used CAM for ailments like backproblems, headaches, depression andanxiety. 3Eighty percent of elderly Californians insured by a MedicareHMO said CAM treatments helpedthem. However, 58 percent did not telltheir doctors they used CAMpractices. 4Ninety percent of family doctors said they believed exerciseand diet, biofeedback, psychotherapyand behavioral medicine were reliable.Fifty percent of these doctors wouldrefer for these services. 5Study of CAM Practices Congress funded an office in the National Institutes of Health in 1992that was charged with studying CAMpractices and informing the public ofits findings. This office became be CAM 20 yearsago are embracing these treatmentstoday. Doctors will also accept othertreatments when research shows theyare safe and effective. 6 Mind-Body Medicine Can the mind affect the body? Research has shown that stress canaffect blood pressure, pulse andbreathing. It can also affect bloodclotting, blood sugar levels, sodiumretention and the immune system. 7It makes sense that if stress can harmthe body, techniques to reduce stressmight help the body. Research hasshown that this is indeed the case.Relaxation, yoga, biofeedback,meditation, guided imagery andpsychotherapy may reduce stress andcontrol blood pressure, 8reduce pain and anxiety and shorten hospitalstays following surgery. 9 People using meditation and relaxation learn to sit comfortably with their eyes closed.They breatheregularly andrepeat a sound,word, phrase orprayer while theyignore all otherthoughts. People using yoga use particularmeditation andbreathingtechniques. Yogafocuses onphysical,emotional and,especially,spiritual well-being. People who use guided imagery believe the mind can create images almost as real as actual events. If theyrelax and think of an image thatstands for a problem, they can controland overcome the problem. People who practice biofeedback use a machine that detects a bodyfunction such as blood pressure,heart rate or body temperature. Themachine sends a signal people can seethat represents a particular bodyfunction. They learn to manipulate thesignals from the machine, and as aresult, control the body function intheir everyday life. Can the Mind Heal the Body?

The Family Focus Editorial Board is by no meansattempting to influence you to use or not to use complementary andalternative treatments. We, however,do want to influence you to informyour partners on your health careteam about any treatments that youare either considering trying or arecurrently using. We want to ensurethat if you use complementary andalternative treatments, you do sowithout any ill effect. There are two issues that your Editorial Board regrets we did nothave the opportunity to explore foryou in this issue. One of these is howour ethnic and cultural backgroundsmay influence how we view and usevarious forms of complementary andalternative treatments. While somecultures may see certain types ofthese treatments as \"mainstream,\"others will view the same treatmentsas anything but common! The otherissue we did not delve into is thehistorical aspect of these treatments.As Dale Ester points out in hisarticle, \"Cautions about Using Karren King NKF Family Focus is published quarterly by the National Kidney Foundation Editorial Office: National Kidney Foundation 30 E. 33rd Street, New York, NY 10016(800) MO Medical Editor: Wendy W.

F Letter to the Editor In 1993, my medical doctor at that time informed me that proteins were \"spilling\" into my urine. My hematologistreferred me to my renal doctor of eight years now. By June22, 1998, a Tenckhoff catheter was placed in myabdomen. I began peritoneal dialysis on July 8, 1998. Istarted out with four treatments a day, but it wasdetermined that I would need five a day after the first year. I have suffered with sickle cell disease since the age of five years. Frankly, ESRD and sickle cell are in direct conflictin my body. Consequently, I 've been having a tough time. I've been going into crisis much too often. As painful as my crisis can be, I 'm in even more pain now and it 's constant. I also have hepatitis C, contracted from a blood transfusion in 1989. I need as much informationas I can get.

Tissues aredamaged when they don 't receive enough blood. Cells may die. Scarsform. If the affected organ is thekidney, it loses the ability to do itswork. The kidney disease thathappened so rapidly in these Belgianwomen may have been caused by acombination of exposure at the sametime to the toxin and the twomedicines that caused a decrease inappetite and a decrease in blood flow. It is also not known why onlysome patients whotook the herbs gotkidney disease, andfor differencesin the way the bodyhandles the toxinand an inherited tendency of a person towards kidney damage from suchtoxins and/or towards development ofcancer. Regardless of how it occurred, there is no question that kidneydisease from Chinese herbs isassociated with the development ofcancer. Presentation and Prognosis Affected patients typically present to a medical professional with kidneyfailure. Their blood pressure is eithernormal or only slightly increased.They don 't have a lot of protein in their urine, and the urine containsonly a few red blood cells and whiteblood cells. Kidney function may range from being slightly decreased or severelydecreased when patients first seetheir doctor. The patients ' creatinines have ranged from 1.4 to 12.7 mg/dl.Those patients with serumcreatinines closer to the normal rangeseem to do well and do not needdialysis. However, progressive kidneyfailure leading to a need for dialysisor a transplant may occur in patientswith more severe disease even if theystop taking the Chinese herbs. Thelonger patients take the herbs, themore likely they are to have severekidney damage. A similar problemhappened to a group of patients fromTaiwan who took some othertraditional Chinese herbs that werenot the same as the weight lossherbs. Even though the Taiwanesepatients stopped taking the herbs,they had kidney failure. Theimportant point to remember is thatthese herbs are not tested likeprescription medications to makesure that they don 't cause harm to the body. In addition, they may notbe \"pure\" but may be mixed with other ingredients that can beharmful. It is always a good idea toask your doctor before you take anyherbs. Treatment There is no effective treatment for the kidney disease that the Chineseherbs cause, although it is possiblethat corticosteroids such asprednisone, may slow the course ofdisease. Because of the risk of cancer,these patients have to be examinedon a regular basis to look for cancerin the kidney, ureters or bladder.Some doctors have suggested thatthese patients should have theirkidneys and ureters surgicallyremoved because of the high risk ofcancer. Lessons Not everything \"natural \" is healthy. Don't take any herbs or herbal remedies without talking to yourdoctor first. You can buy many\"over-the-counter natural medicines \" without a prescription that can harm you. Natural herbs may be more harmful for patients who alreadyhave kidney disease. St. John 's Wort, for example, which hasbeen used to treat depression,shouldn 't be used by anyone with a transplant because it affects theblood level of medicines that helpprevent transplant rejection. Marc E. DeBroe, MD, PhD, is with the Department of Nephrology at the University of Antwerp in Belgium.Kidney Disease Caused By Chinese Herbs By Marc E. DeBroe, MD, PhD It is very important to be aware that \"natural \" herbal remedies, many of which can be pur- chased easily in grocery, drug orhealth food stores, can be harmful tothe kidneys or other organs. Doctorsin Belgium noted an increasingnumber of women who developedacute, often near end-stage kidneyfailure after taking Chinese herbs ata weight reduction clinic in 1991. Atotal of 14 women were found to havesevere kidney disease over a threeyear period of time in Brussels,Belgium. They had kidney biopsiesthat showed a type of kidney diseasecalled chronic tubulo-interstitialnephritis; nine of these women tookChinese herbs to lose weight. Morethan 100 women who had developedkidney disease from taking Chineseherbs were identified by early 1999.More than one-third of these patientshave already had kidney transplants. In addition to causing kidney failure, these Chinese herbs alsoaffect cells in the kidneys andureters, causing changes that canresult in cancer of the kidneys orureters (tubes that carry urine fromthe kidney to the bladder). As aprecaution against developing cancer,Belgian doctors have removed nativekidneys and ureters from 10 patientsduring or after kidney transplant. Atleast one of these patients hadbladder cancer. Four patients had anearly form of cancer. The rest of thepatients had cells which lookedabnormal and showed changes thatmight lead to cancer. The reason that Chinese herbs cause kidney disease is not wellunderstood. A toxin (poison),aristolochic acid, found in someChinese plants that cause kidneydamage was thought to be a possiblecause of the kidney failure, but it wasnot part of the herbal preparationsused by all the patients. In addition,this chemical has been used bythousands of patients in Germany formore than 20 years to regulate theimmune system and has not causedkidney disease in any of thesepatients. In addition to Chinese herbs, patients who developed kidneydisease also took two medicines forweight loss. These medicines,fenfluramine and diethylpropion,cause a decrease in appetite. In F5 Family Focus Volume 10 Number 3It may seem that herbal formulations can 't be life- threatening or even the least bit dangerous because they are sold overthe counter in grocery and healthfood stores. Buyer beware! You mustbe careful because herbal treatmentsare medications and all drugs havesome effect on the human body. Although herbs were used largely in their raw and unprocessedform by the human race longbefore the present time, it doesnot mean they are any safer orhave fewer risks or benefitstoday. We have simply come toknow more about them. Herbsare often called complementarymedicines or herbal treat-ments, but don 't be fooled by the different names used to explain thesame thing. Many of thesetreatments, regardless of the nameused to describe them, could result ina serious and dangerous, possiblyeven life-threatening, crisis. How does one know if an herbal treatment is safe? If it works well fora friend or a family member, willit be a good treatment for you?No two people are alike. Thismeans that what works well forthem may not work well for you.In fact, it may not work at all foryou! They may not have had abad reaction from taking aparticular supplement but youmight. Are the risks worth it? It is important to look closely at theproposed benefits and to decidewhether they outweigh the potentialrisks. An herbal formulation thatsolves a specific problem withoutcausing other health problems wouldbe beneficial. However, if thetreatment creates problems on top ofthe existing condition it could berisky. Weighing the pros and cons may be confusing, so here are somesuggestions for how to approachherbal treatments: 1) Proceed with extreme caution.2) Discuss the treatment idea with your health care team before youstart the treatment. 3) If your doctor says it is okay to take the supplement, learn as much as possible about it to familiarize yourself with any potential side effects. 4) Share the responsibility about whether to use herbal treatments with yourhealth care team by knowing theproposed benefits and thepotential risks before making apersonal choice. Ask yourself, \"Do the potential positive effectsoutweigh the negative ones? \" Herbal treatments can be a friend if they solve health problems or a foe if they create more problems than expected. Since no two people are alike, the benefits of complementary medicine for one person will be different from those for another. The benefits should always outweigh the potential risks. Discussing any treatment ideas with your health care team and kidney doctor before you decide to start an herbal treatmentprogram will always be the wisestway to achieve the best possiblehealth outcome. Remember thatsafety begins by knowing that herbaltreatments and complementarymedicines are real drugs in adifferent form than what you may beused to seeing. Your life may dependon proceeding with caution andlearning the facts.To Learn More About CAM Alternative Medicine: www.nccam.nih.gov or call the National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine at 888-644-6226 NCCAM fact sheets: http://nccam.nih.gov/fcp/factsheets Research centers working with the NCCAM:http://nccam.nih.gov/nccam/fi/r ese arch/centers.html or call the NCCAM Clearinghouse at (301) 589-5367 or(888) 644-6226 National Library of Medicine database of free abstracts of journal articles onCAM:http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nccam/cam onpubmed.html# The Combined Health Information Database: http://www.chid.nih.gov Acupuncture: at 323-937-5514 Herbal remedies: www.herbs.or gor call the Herb Research Foundation at800-748-2617PATIENT AND FAMILY CORNER Cautions About Using Alternative Treatments By Dale Ester FDonate your used car to the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Cars Program.

Put Some\"Good\" In the Goodbye! 6 Family Focus Volume 10 Number 3Alternative medicine has been around for centuries and it 's making a comeback. An estimated 629 million Americanssought alternative medicine practi-tioners and 60 million Americans weretaking herbs daily in 1997. 1One reason for this increase is that herbalsupplements appeal to people 's desires for a quick fix, and they allowpeople to participate in their own care.You must be aware though becausesupplements may not be safe for thosesuffering from kidney disease, dia-betes and other diseases. Who regulates herbal supplements? According to the Dietary Supple- ments Health and Education Act(DSHEA) of 1994, dietary supplementsinclude ingredients such as herbs,vitamins, minerals, amino acids andsubstances such as enzymes, organtissues, glandulars and metabolite. 2 The manufacturer regulates the safetyof its own product according to theAct 2and is not required to notify the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) orconsumers of any reported adverseeffects. However, the FDA monitorsthe safety of these products throughvoluntary reports. 3 How safe are herbal supplements? The safety of the supplement depends on the consumer 's medical history. Side effects have beendocumented about consumers whohave taken \"safe\" herbs such as ginkgo biloba, ginseng and St. John 's Wart. Ginkgo biloba may causeinfrequent headaches or gastro-intestinal upset and shouldn 't be taken if you have a bleeding disorder. 4 Ginseng may cause someone to sufferfrom headaches, inability to sleep,nervousness, diarrhea, rashes,asthma attacks, high blood pressureand arrhythmias. 4St. John 's Wart, which is often taken to improve aperson 's emotional well-being, is not without its share of complications. Itmay hinder the effectiveness ofcyclosporin and other immunosup-pressants used to prevent transplantrejection and cause high bloodpressure when taken with beta-blockers medication. 4,5 Aristolochic acid is sometimes used to stimulate the immune system. Itmay also be used for treating GI andgallbladder colic that is caused byallergies, gynecological problems,wounds and ulcers and problemsassociated with the ears, nose andthroat. Artistolochic acid andproducts that contain it have beenfound to be toxic to the kidney and tocause cancer. 6Approximately 100 cases of kidney disease werediagnosed in people who used aproduct containing aristolochic acid inBelgium, and 70 of them requireddialysis or transplantation. 7 Why may supplements be unsafe? Complications from taking herbal supplements may arise due tounknown effects that have not yetbeen documented, long-term use orthe kidney 's inability to filter waste products. Consumers may alsoexperience negative side effects fromcomplications caused by their diseasewhen taking a supplement. Forinstance, those on dialysis should bewary of herbs that do not listpotassium and phosphorus on thelabel. Also, contamination of herbalsupplements with such ingredients aslead, arsenic, gasoline and bleachhave been well documented. 8,9 What can you do? Learn about the ingredients listedon the label. It 's important to beaware thatmanufacturers arenot required to themanufacturers fornutrient analysis. Most important,talk to your medical professionalsabout their experiences with variousherbal products and theirrecommendations about using them.Use the Internet to gain productinformation. Finally, tell the medicalprofessionals on your kidney teamabout any herbal supplements thatyou are taking and report anyphysical and emotional changes thatyou have noticed since taking them. Itmay be the most important piece ofinformation that you provide to them!References 1.Eisenberg DM et al: Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States 1990-1997: Results of a follow-up nationalsurvey.

Over-the-counter drugs are medicines that you buy without a doctor 's prescription. You may also hear them called OTC drugs or non-prescription drugs. You can buy OTC drugs from grocerystores, convenience stores, gas stations, drug stores and even from TV ads andInternet Web sites. The most common OTC drugs are medicines for cold, cough, fever,headache, pain, constipation ordiarrhea. Other products that areconsidered OTC drugs are herbal ornatural medicines, vitamins, minerals,weight loss drugs and diet supple-ments. OTC drugs are very popularbecause you don 't need a prescription, you can find them in almost any storeand they 're usually cheaper than prescription drugs. If you or a family member has chronic kidney disease or kidneyfailure, however, you need to be verycareful with all OTC drugs. Justbecause you can buy these medicineswithout a prescription doesn 't mean it's safe for you to take them. OTC drugs are serious medicines and if youhave kidney disease or kidney failure,they can make you sick or cause life-threatening side effects. Should I check with my kidney doctor before I start taking an OTC drug? YES! Many medicines act differently or build up inside your body when youhave kidney failure. Ask your kidneydoctor about an OTC drug before youbuy the drug and start taking it. If youare already taking any OTC drugs,take time during your next treatmentto tell your kidney doctor or nursewhat OTC drugs you 're taking. It 's very important that you tell your kidneydoctor if you 're taking any OTC drugs because: ISome OTC drugs can change how your prescribed medicines work.They can make prescribedmedicines weaker or make them toostrong. They can even stop yourprescribed medicines from working. IChemicals or electrolytes in some OTC drugs (like potassium, sodium,phosphorus, magnesium andaluminum) can build up in yourbody and make you sick or even putyour life in danger.IThe OTC drugs and your prescrip- tion medicines could \"fight\" inside your body and cause serious sideeffects or allergic reactions. ISome OTC drugs can cause increased bleeding. If you have agraft or fistula, this could makeyour needle sites bleed longer afterdialysis. Are there common OTC drugs that I should avoid? YES! You should not take the OTC drugs listed below unless your kidneydoctor tells you to take them. IAlka-Seltzer, baking soda or other bubbling medicines \u2014high in sodium, cause extra fluid gains. IMilk of Magnesia or antacids \u2014many have magnesium or aluminum thatcan build up in your body andcause nervous system problems. IEnemas or laxatives \u2014may be high in phosphorus; can also make youdehydrated and make your bodylose important chemicals. IAspirin \u2014can cause increased bleeding. IVitamins and minerals \u2014vitamins and minerals are also medicinesand some can make you sick if youtake them; take only vitamins yourkidney doctor prescribes for you. IDiet supplements \u2014contain high levels of potassium and magnesium;check with your kidney doctor ordietitian about these products. Do I need to tell my kidney doctor if I'm taking herbs or herbal products? YES! You should always tell your doctor if you are taking or plan ontaking an herbal product. Manypeople think that because herbalproducts are \"natural \" they're safe. That is not true, especially for peoplewith kidney disease and kidneyfailure. Many herbal products can bevery dangerous for you. They maycause: IWorsening of kidney disease ILoss of a kidney transplant IHigh potassium or phosphorus levels IIncreased bleeding IChanges in how your prescribed medicines such as those for yourblood pressure work. Does my care team need to know about \"home remedies\" that I use? YES! You should tell your kidney doctors and nurses about any homeremedies that you use. Most of thesehome remedies are probably safe.However, there 's always a chance that your home remedy could make yousicker. It could be full of potassium orsalt, or it could change how yourmedicines work. Your kidney doctorwill be able to tell you if your homeremedy is safe for you. Remember\u2014every OTC, home remedy, herbal product or alternativetreatment (i.e., acupuncture,chiropractic treatment) that you usehas an impact on your personal healthand well-being. You can help yourselfby keeping your treatment teaminformed about the use of any of theseOTC drugs or treatments!

I 'm one of them. Learning how to livesuccessfully with a chronic illnesshas been the biggest challenge of mylife. Chronic illness is different from other maladies. Seemingly endless,its cure lies in some distant future.It can be life threatening or simplyannoying. You are forced to face liferather than face death; putting thebrakes on a once complacent,confident perspective and beingsent forth into the unknown. Living successfully with an illness seems like an oxymoronand almost impossible to some. Iwas tossed on the flip side of lifeinstantly, seeing everythingthrough dark, distorted glasses. Irealized our society slices us intotwo distinct groups \u2014the healthy and the not-so healthy, with thehealthy confounded as to how tohandle the not so healthy. I couldsee them but could they see me? I was expected to at least appear whole, and quickly, thank you.Stories about \"overcoming, \" or even \"denying, \" disability lurched out at me; running the marathon with oneleg, climbing Mt. Everest whileblind. Surely acts of heroism, butnot truly mainstream. These are the\"disability superstars, \" anointed to represent all the nameless rest of uswho aren 't quite so brave, quite so resilient. It sometimes seems that people with disabilities have to dance just abit better and faster than others tomake other people feel good aboutthemselves. We 're made to feel guilty just sloshing through the day likeeverybody else instead of trying to be\"more than. \" Kidney failure is deceptive. \"You look terrific! \" If you look well then surely you are well, regardless ofhow you feel. We 're all products of a perfection-seeking childhood. Ourfeelings about illness are rooted inour earliest memories; thoseworried parental whispers whensomething is \"wrong. \" We learn straight from the womb to befearful of \"different. \" Society follows a rigid set of rules for what is considered \"normal. \" \"Be yourself, \" yet we chastise the individuality out of our little ones,lest they be shunned as\"unpopular. \" We prize individuality but assess it within very narrowparameters, comparing ourselvesincessantly to the perfect ones inmagazines. \"Don't be a crybaby! \" We chide our children to blink back tears,hide their anger or disappointment,bite their lips and avoid eyecontact. Try to be brave . Rather than teaching them how to face andget past their fears, we teach thefine art of numbing, of self-paralysis \u2014to not feel at all, to be alone with their boogey men. It 's how we become grown-ups \u2014to distance ourselves from ourselves.And it has a profound effect on howwe handle illness later. It traps usin fear. Culturally fanatic aboutstrength, we espouse the belief thatnegative emotions are weak.\"Nothing ever gets you down, \" or \"You're tougher than you think \" only tighten our vise-like sense ofanxiety. Think positive. O.K, but I wasYou Can Be Whole By Pat Donnelly mad as hell when I found out I was dealt a chronic illness. I couldn 't think of a single positive thingabout it. I felt cheated, envious ofthe still healthy, absolute despairfor my own future and frightened ascan be. I wanted to run, to hide, butthere was no place to go. Andalways, there 's a fathomless, nagging loneliness. I began to search for the \"cure, \" examining every treatment thatcame down the pike. I bought everyNew Age book, studied Easternreligions, learned to meditate,visualized, changed my diet, bulked up on seaweed and learnedbiofeedback. Vitamin therapy,herbs, magnets, shamans;somewhere, someone musthold the answer, the key tocontrolling or even obliteratingmy illness. I thought I couldrise above it, cleanse my bodyof its frailties, overpower it withmy will. When I couldn 't, I felt defeated, worthless, inept anddeserving to be sick. I waslooking for a way out ratherthan creating a way to stay in. I blamed God. How could He let this happen? What had I done? How could I win back Hisfavor and perhaps, dream ofdreams, maybe procure a littlemiracle? How foolish I was. I truly believed I was capable of controlling everyaspect of my life. Why not? That 's what I 'd been taught. When that miracle didn 't come, somewhere deep inside, a piece of me whisperedthat perhaps I didn 't deserve one. Finally, a break came. Months of searching began piecing itselftogether into an almost crazypatchwork of ideas, bits and piecespilfered from this belief or thatopinion. I chewed up what I likedand spat out what I didn 't. Reality is I'm not a Tibetan monk. I'm a Westerner whose mind is cluttered with insignificant culturalfacts and brimming with single,unrelated refrains to a thousand Pat Donnelly has learned to live with her illness, in part, by focusing on her present quality of life. continued on next page9 Family Focus Volume 10 Number 3Exercise.

F KellyFamily Focus Volume 10 Number 311 Hemodialysis therapy has come a long way since thefirst outpatient dialysis program was established in Seattle inthe 1960s. New dialyzers andhemodialysis machines allow dialysisfluid to flow faster, resulting in betterremoval of toxins from the blood.Severe nausea and fatigue caused bydialysis don 't occur as often as they used to due to changes in the dialysisfluid chemicals and new dialysismachines that control the amount ofwater removed. Measurement of theflow of the blood through dialysisgrafts and fistulas allows early repairof accesses that are not working wellbefore they become completelyunusable. Current research is beingdone in two areas: increasing thenumber of dialysis treatments given toa patient each week, or increaseddialysis frequency, and improvementsin the design of hemodialysiscatheters. Increased Dialysis Frequency Undergoing three hemodialysis sessions a week seems hardenough. Increasing the number oftreatments hardly seems like animprovement. However, manyexperts point out that healthykidneys clean the blood 24 hourseach day, seven days a week, sowhy should we expect that threetreatments a week of only three tofour hours each would be enough fordialysis patients? Carl Kjellstrand, MD, PhD, FACP, FRCPC, an expert in daily dialysistherapy, points out that after eachdialysis session, waste products andfluid build up in the body until thenext treatment. Since the nexttreatment is usually two or three dayslater, toxins and fluid reach highlevels, only to be rapidly removedduring dialysis and then the cycle isrepeated all over again. It looks likethis constant up and down pattern ofwaste products and fluid can, overtime, cause damage to the heart,brain and bones. Also, many of thecommon side effects of hemodialysissuch as cramps, sudden drops inblood pressure and the \"washed-out \" feeling that many experience arecaused by the rapid removal of thesetoxins and fluid. Daily dialysis forshorter periods of time or with slowerblood flow rates may do away withsome of the side effects of dialysistreatments. Many people would ratherhave a short dialysis treatment everyday and feel well afterward thanhave only three treatments a weekand feel sick and tired after eachone. Most people who have daily dialysis have better blood pressurecontrol and need fewer bloodpressure medicines. Phosphate levelsare often lower and the red blood cellcount is usually higher in those ondaily dialysis. Perhaps mostimportant, people who are on thistype of dialysis tend to feel better, aremore active and have a greaterenjoyment of life. Daily dialysis may be done in different ways. Some units have youcome to the dialysis unit for shortdaily treatments. Other centers usenightly dialysis in special unitswhere you may sleep while receiving treatment. You or your partner can be taught to operate the dialysismachine in the home for shortdaytime or overnight dialysissessions. Also, some centers use theInternet to connect dialysismachines in the home to the dialysisunit where the treatment is checkedby trained technicians. Daily dialysis is, in fact, more convenient than traditional dialysisin that it may take place in thehome. It also allows you to takefewer medicines, have a lessrestrictive diet and fluid limit andfeel better, while possibly reducingheart and bone disease. At present,one of the main reasons that dailydialysis isn 't done more often is that Medicare and insurers don 't want to pay for it. New Hemodialysis Catheters Many people need dialysis before a graft or fistula is ready to use, orthey have problems with their graftor fistula and need to use a dialysiscatheter. Sometimes those ondialysis run out of places to put newgrafts and must use catheterspermanently. Unfortunately, thesecatheters may cause life-threateninginfections. In addition, blood flowthrough catheters may not be goodenough to clear waste productsadequately from the blood. New dialysis catheters have been made that have specially shapedtubing that improves blood flow.Some catheters are made out ofplastic containing antibiotics orsilver, both of which may helpprevent infections by not allowingbacteria to grow. Another way toprevent infections is to have thewhole catheter placed under the skinso it is harder for bacteria to enter.Special dialysis needles are placedthrough the skin into the catheter. Itwill take some time before we know if these catheters will do a better job. Though hemodialysis is life- sustaining for hundreds ofthousands of patients, significantcomplications are an all too commonoccurrence in dialysis patients. Newcatheter designs and increased useof daily dialysis are revolutionarychanges with tremendous potentialto improve your quality of life. Theseadvances in the science andtechnology of dialysis may soon allow hemodialysis patients to livelonger, healthier and more satisfying lives.

Remember to check with your physician before embarking on a new exercise regimen. Read on! Ithought sweat was disgusting before I developed kidney failure.After all, I 'm a girl and girls don 't sweat! We have make-up, hairdos anddelicate clothes to protect. Sweat isnot pretty; it stinks; it certainly won 't attract a guy. It doesn 't feel clean to sweat. How could it be clean, whenyou always have to wash the clothesyou have worn when sweating? So Itrained myself from an early age not tosweat. I had the appropriate light-weight clothing, the air conditionerand the iced tea \u2014all ready to launch an attack at any hint of a glisten. Then I developed kidney failure. I was told the goal was to gain less thantwo pounds between hemodialysistreatments. But what about thosedays when I was ridiculously thirstyfor no apparent reason? When I took asip, I would put the drink back in therefrigerator and try to walk away, but Iwould make a U-turn back and gulpthat precious fluid down! What aboutwhen I would stingily pour out a tinyglass of cranberry juice over ice, thenfeel that cold explosion of flavor as itflowed over my parched throat, andpour myself another and another andanother? I had blown the fluid restriction on lots of days before I knew it. I couldtell. My eyes were puffy. I failed my\"ring test, \" which is when the ring I wore that fit loosely on my finger justafter dialysis was too tight to remove.Whenever I failed the \"ring test, \" I knew it was time to take action. But atfirst, I didn 't know what action to take. I just had to try to not drinkanother DROP of fluid until the nextdialysis session. Rarely was that plansuccessful. I would step sheepishlyonto the scale at dialysis and realizethat I had a hellish session ahead ofme\u2014one filled with plummeting blood pressure and plenty of cramps as Itried to remove too many kilos of fluidin such a short time. Then it dawned on me one very hot day. Sweat is fluid \u2014fluid that I could get rid of before my next dialysistreatment even if I couldn 't urinate. I started changing my attitude aboutsweat. I tried to convince myself, \"It's not disgusting; it 's beautiful! \" I asked my dialysis nurse what exactly is insweat. She told me that sweatincludes sodiumand asmallamount ofpotassium.She saidthat skinis actually like a third kidney in that it can filterout some toxins through sweat. Ithought, \"Hallelujah! \" Why had no one told me this before? I envisionedgetting a sweat box for my living roomwith just my head sticking outthrough a hole, like I 'd seen on I Love Lucy and in cartoons. Oh, the liberation I could get from this nuggetof wisdom! I sprang into action. I started wearing more clothes than I needed towear. I kept the heater on in my caruntil I could feel myself start to sweat.I took long walks and bike rideswearing extra sweatshirts and awindbreaker. Sometimes I would come home drenched from sweat. True, I had to do more laundry, but my ringturned easily on my finger. I waspassing the \"ring test \" with flying colors. I was able to arrive at dialysisonly a pound or two over my dryweight even though I was drinkingmore fluid. I felt much better. My labresults were great. Sweat was my newbest friend. I still enjoy sweating even now that I have a kidney transplant. It feels goodto know that I am cleansing my body oftoxins when I sweat. When I 'm sweat- ing a lot, I always keep track of myweight to make sure I 'm not losing too much fluid and getting dehydrated.Usually, I 'm not. Sweat is beautiful.

Awareness ofyour child's current abilities will helpyou determine which tasks your childcan be successful in doing alone orwith your assistance and which tasksyou will need to do for your child.When skill problems are identified,the clinic nurse can often help teachyour child. It is equally important to be aware of your child's skill strengths. It islikely that your child will be interestedin participating in aspects of thedialysis routine that he or she is goodat doing. It is also possible that yourchild may be better able than you todo some of the dialysis tasks. Being aware of your child's feelings regarding the benefits and drawbacksof independence in dialysis will allowyou to use strategies to decreaseunrealistic fears he or she may haveabout doing dialysis alone. Finally, itis important to reevaluate yourexpectations for your child'sindependence and participation as heor she grows and develops. Organize the home environment to boost successful participation Home dialysis can be a complicated and time-consuming responsibility.You will be able to increase yourchild's motivation and success indoing dialysis independently ifsupplies are kept together in aconsistent location, the room that isused during the hook-up is quiet andcalm and you insist that dialysis bedone at approximately the same timeeach day. Use of these strategies givesa child a sense of comfort, control andconfidence about safety and successwith home dialysis. Provide regular enthusiastic praise and occasional tangible reinforcement for adherence Without obtaining yourchild's interestin participatingin homedialysis, there isno hope ofincreasing thechild's involvement.You can get and keep your child 's interest by providing reinforcement that is rewarding adesired behavior. Since reinforcementof desired behavior leads to itscontinuation and improvement orincrease, it is particularly importantto pay attention to the kinds ofreinforcement that are meaningful toyour child. It is important to praise a child's attempts at increased independencerather than waiting until he or she isfully successful. Many children havebehavioral improvements when theyare given reinforcement in the form ofenthusiastic praise for their efforts.Other children need tangible rein-forcement such as toys, food treats orprivileges for behavioral improvementsto occur. Unfortunately, performing dialysis is not a very rewarding task. In otherwords, staying healthy is often not astrong enough reinforcement toencourage adherence to dialysis. Infact, performing dialysis ofteninterferes with a child's ability toparticipate in more enjoyableactivities, and for many children,dialysis is perceived as an unpleasantor disagreeable experience. Therefore,you will need to give praise andoccasional rewards. This will helpyour child achieve involvement andindependence that is age-appropriatein home dialysis. If serious adherenceproblems surface, you may want toconsult with the unit social worker orask your child's health care providerto refer you to a therapist who canhelp you identify your child 's preferred rewards. Provide a safety net of supervision to assure that the treatment regimen is carried out It is important to recognize that a child's interest in participating indialysis treatment will wax and wanethroughout childhood, adolescenceand early adulthood. You will need tomonitor this and vary your interven-tions to increase participation andindependence as needed. Ultimately,however, parents need to provide asafety net of supervision to assurethat dialysis is being completedcorrectly and consistently. In summary: Be realistic about your expectations. Organize your home environment to encourage and support yourchild's successful involvement. Give your child positive feedback about his or her involvement andindependence. Always supervise. How to Increase Your Child's Adherence With Home Dialysis By Arlene C. Gerson, PhD, and Barbara Fivush, MD Adherence is defined by how well patients follow medical advice. Most parents know that adherence has health benefits and that non-adherence usually results in health problems.Unfortunately, children and adolescents often do not recognize the relationship between their behavior and their health. As a result, many children do not participate eagerly in their medical self-care. Infact, when home dialysis is needed, parents frequently have problems getting their child to follow thedoctor's orders. This article will suggest strategies to improve your child's adherence with home dialysis. F 14 Family Focus Volume 10 Number 3Government Support of Medical Research Benefits Kidney Patients By Dolph Chianchiano, JD, MPA The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Office of Scientific and PublicPolicy, in addition to its advocacy forMedicare and Medicaid programs thatbenefit kidney patients, is activelyinvolved in generating support for thekidney research programs of theNational Institutes of Health (NIH), anagency of the U.S. government. The principle organization suppor- ting kidney research at the NIH is theNational Institute of Diabetes andDigestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).A 17-member Advisory Council decidesfunding priorities for the NIDDK. JudgeLevan Gordon, a member of the Boardof Directors of the NKF, is also amember of that Advisory Council.NIDDK is supporting many researchprojects that pertain to the well-being ofdialysis patients. The Hemodialysis Study, for example, is designed to investigatewhether higher levels of dialysis doseand changes in dialysis flux improvehow long those on dialysis live and if itreduces their hospitalization. Thereare 15 centers representing 900patients that are involved in the study.The study began on June 1, 1995, andthe final results should be available byNovember 2001. The goal of the Vascular Access Clinical Trials Network, which wasdeveloped last year and is funded bythe NIDDK, is to study ways todecrease hospitalization for those ondialysis due to vascular accessproblems. Problems related to vascularaccess account for 15 to 25 percent ofthe hospital admissions for people ondialysis in the United States. TheVascular Access Clinical TrialsNetwork was begun because there havebeen few rigorous studies that usemedications to prevent vascular accessfailure, and because there are newtherapies on the horizon that shouldbe thoroughly evaluated. The researchon vascular access, which will soon beunder way, will be conducted at sixcenters: University of Texas SouthwestMedical Center (Dallas), Maine MedicalCenter, University of Iowa, ClevelandClinic Foundation, Duke UniversityMedical Center (Durham, NorthCarolina) and Boston Medical Center.Ultimately 2,000 patients will beinvolved in this project.Dr. Alan Christensen at the University of Iowa has been funded bythe NIDDK since 1995 to study thequality of life of those with kidneyfailure. His research examines whethercertain psychosocial characteristicsmake some people better candidates forcertain kinds of dialysis therapy. He isalso identifying personal characteristicsthat are related to adjustment for thosewith a kidney transplant. AnotherNIDDK grant has been awarded to Dr.Ashwini Sehgal at Case WesternReserve University in Cleveland, Ohio,for the project, \"Overcoming Barriers to Adequate Delivery of Hemodialysis. \" This study will explore whether patient-provider communication is a barrier toadequate delivery of hemodialysis, andit will test interventions that couldimprove this communication. Inaddition, NIDDK has provided grants toVanderbilt University in Nashville,Tennessee, for a study of malnutritionin people on dialysis, and to theNorthern California Institute ofResearch and Education for researchon exercise for those on hemodialysis. An additional NIDDK study is currently in the planning stage. Thistrial will compare the outcomes ofpeople who are on daily hemodialysiswith those who receive hemodialysistreatments three times a week. The costof the study is being shared by theCenters for Medicare and MedicaidServices (CMS), formerly known as theHealth Care Financing Administration.The trial will document the cost of dailydialysis so that a payment policy can bedeveloped for it. It is clear that NIH-financed research is paving the way for better treatmentof kidney disease. However, funding forthe study of kidney disease competeswith demands for research on otherimportant health problems, such asAIDS, arthritis and cancer. We need tocontinually remind members ofCongress that breakthroughs in ourunderstanding of kidney disease and itstreatment are vital. If you are willing tohelp get that message across todecision makers in Washington, pleasecall the National Kidney FoundationOffice of Scientific and Public Policy at (800) 889-9559.

FGood Luck or Good Management By Richard Dulebohn This article was written in response to \"What is Quality Care?\" which was featured in theWinter 2001 issue of Family Focus. Ifeel cold dread knowing again today that I must go ...to what? Will it be another day like that? Wheeled down into the icy, night-marish, dialysis dungeon where, itseemed, civilized life came to a halt. Iwas manacled to the rack; a beepingred-eyed monster sucked my bloodand then spat it out. Masked, robedimps with blue hands crept aroundpinching my arm and mutteringincantations. Later, I felt weary relief,not that my life was reprieved foranother treatment \u2014just that the ordeal was over. Yet I have felt the wonder of being in a well-run, comfortable unit in adistant city, like a dream where thereis no dread of dialysis, no halted life,no stress. I have rejoiced in my goodluck. In my more lucid moments, Irecognize it 's not luck or anything mysterious that results in this type ofunit. It is good management. Good managers can be found. They need to be told what their job involves,to stay within the budget and to followthe prescription for each patient 's treatment. Additionally, they must seethat the time the patient spends intheir care is pleasant. The goal shouldbe to provide a non-jarring ambiencethat allows the mind to drift andmeditation to happen. Two types ofchanges, one involving the facility andthe other the personnel, are needed tocreate this type of environment. Architectural and mechanical Managers should have budgeted funds to keep machines and dialysischairs in repair and to make changesto things that jar or irritate people inthe unit. The following are just a fewexamples of annoying deficiencies thatI have observed in various clinics. NThe wheelchair accessibility is too difficult. continued on next pageRichard Dulebohn relaxes in front of his home in western Oregon 15 Family Focus Volume 10 Number 3NThere are no nurse or attendant call buttons. NThe chairs are poorly designed and constructed so that in the positionfurthest down, a little squirming causesthe chair back to drop and the footrestto rise abruptly. Chair footrest 's adjust- ments are faulty, as they often requirethe use of stools to hold them up. NThe automated blood pressure cuff works on only a few chairs. NWhen chair backs are lowered, patients face dazzling ceiling lights.This strains the eyes when reading abook or watching TV. NNo diversion other than TV is offered. NVentilation and air-conditioning produce cold drafts. NPatients have to carry blankets and other personal items from home eachtime they come to dialysis becausestorage space is unavailable. NThe waiting room is too small and drafty because the entrance door opensdirectly to the street. Waits in thoserooms are long. Things like these are easy to spot and repair. One just has to look!Personnel selection and education Even with low staff turnover, staff selection and training are difficultbecause every patient has his or herunique problems and the personnel have their own strengths and weaknesses. The manager must moldthem into a team and pass a positiveattitude on to both. A nurse assesses the patient physically before and after eachtreatment. At that time, the nurseshould also monitor the technician 's finesse and gentleness in handling theneedles and the patient 's access. It is also the nurse 's responsibility to assess the patient 's emotional condition and morale and then advise the technicianif the patient needs special attentionthat day or about conditions to watchfor during blood pressure checks. For example, the technician can offer a cupof ice, help arrange pillows or blankets,assist with the adjustment of the chairor provide earphones, TV remotecontrol or a portable phone. Thusguided, a potentially good technicianwill learn to ask, \"Is there anything else you need? \" before leaving. The manager should arrange informal staff conferences to emphasize the needto treat patients with respect andcourtesy. This should include a reviewof the clinic 's policy on noise, radio and TV. Loud personal conversationsbetween patients and even staff caninterfere with healing. The socialworker, with the patient 's consent, should also brief the staff on relevantpatient needs or preferences that havebeen identified. Good management of dialysis units can assure that all patients receive thetype of stress-free care they deserve. Mr. Dulebohn was born in 1919. He practiced architecture and engineering inOhio, California and Idaho. He retired in1981, married Mary C., and moved to amountain cabin in northern Idaho. Afteran operation to replace a dissectingaorta in 1992, he lost kidney functionand began hemodialysis. The Dulebohnsmoved to western Oregon in 1999. Ihave been on dialysis for four years and the first two of those were awful for me. I got cramps, had abadly bruised arm and was often dizzy and nauseous. My strength, ability to work and play, finan-cial circumstances, physical appearance, sexual driveand outlook on life were changing. I asked \"why me\" andfelt extremely sorry for myself. I avoided family andfriends, cried a lot when I was alone and I only did whatI had to do for my daughter. I was in a deep depression. My attitude began to change, however, and as a result, things became easier to handle. While it iscertainly true that I would be much luckier if I hadnever gotten kidney disease, it could be a lot worse. If ithad been my heart or another organ rather than mykidneys that failed, I would probably be dead now.Thank goodness for the inventors of dialysis machines. I have learned to appreciate so much that I once took for granted. I used to worry about everything, but I havecome to realize that worrying only wastes time. It won 't change the outcome. Arguing over trivial things withloved ones also seems foolish. Who cares whoseviewpoint is right? Just think of each other 's feelings and drop unimportant issues. Every day we need to actas if it may be the last time we will see our loved onesand never part ways angry or with a bad word. We neverknow what will happen in this world and to live withregrets forever would be unbearable. I am so grateful formy loving family and friends who are there for me nomatter what happens. I am also extremely grateful for Dena, my angel, who has recently come into my life. I was at my sister 's home in December 2000 at the same time that Dena wasvisiting. She had noticed that I was ill and called mysister the next day to ask about me. When she discov-ered that I needed a kidney transplant she decided to tryto donate one of her kidneys to me. She wanted to seethe results of being a donor in her lifetime rather thanwaiting until after her death. I was speechless! What doyou say to someone who offers you health after 10 longyears with kidney disease and four years on dialysis? Iwill soon be free of dialysis because of the kind-heartedselflessness of Dena, who is a 28-year-old mother oftwo. Dena 's response to my words is \"How can people not do this ...give up a few months in order to give someone so much?\" It isn 't just giving to one person but also to a spouse, children, parents, siblings and friends. Denahas said that her scar will be a reminder that she notonly gave life to her two boys but to me as well. She isGod-sent. If only more people were like Dena, my angel. The transplant surgery was a success and both Donna and Dena are doing well. Dena was released from thehospital only four days after the surgery to remove herkidney, and she returned to work 26 days afterward. Sheis now interested in becoming a bone marrow donor.Donna had some initial rejection of the kidney but is nowoff dialysis. Dena 2, the name Donna has given her newkidney, seems to be adjusting.

It ached her heart to see her dad go through this each day, But there was nothing she could do, much to her dismay. The doctors ran all kinds of tests on his kidneys, to see what could be done, They concluded he could live a normal life, if he had a good one. They ran compatibility tests with the family, including her sister and her brother, The doctors decided the donor should be Debbie and no other. What a decision she had to make, Would she someday need the kidney they wanted to take? But this was her dad who made sacrifices for her throughout the years, When she thought about her decision it brought her to tears. What better way to show the love that she had, Than to give the \"Gift of Life\" to her cherished dad? So on April 14, 1993, this courageous young lady showed the ultimate meaning of love, Now they'll both lead productive lives with God's blessings from above. What an inspiration she has been and as long as she's living, She'll always be happy, because she knows the joy of giving. Dialysis By Jose A.
