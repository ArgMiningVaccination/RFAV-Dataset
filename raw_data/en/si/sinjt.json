Excludes gift vouchers Zoisite is one of those stones that beg you to \"get up and go\". Zoisite can help you get back your creative spark and focus on what you really enjoy doing. It keeps you from being lazy and idle. Zoisite transmutes negative energy into the positive and further enhances trust, not only in yourself, but the universe in general. It helps you understand and communicate your own truths, without the influence of others. Associated with the Earth element, Zoisite helps you get out and enjoy nature, bringing with it a sense of joy and wonder. At work, this lovely stone can keep you on track, especially when being interrupted. It's a good stone to keep by the phone to deter unwanted callers. Physically, Zoisite detoxifies the body and alleviates inflammation. It promotes strength in the immune system, heart, lungs, spleen and pancreas. Zoisite can help heal problems associated with the reproductive organs and increase fertility (especially when combined with Ruby).
