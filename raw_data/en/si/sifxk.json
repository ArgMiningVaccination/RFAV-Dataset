They also prevent spreading it to friends and family who could get very sick. Vaccines greatly reduce the chance of getting and spreading COVID-19 Over 2 million youth in Canada and over 250,000 youth in B.C. aged 12-17 have already received a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Each vaccine goes through a rigorous testing and approval process November 8, 20211 2CASE RATES in BC Sept. 19 - Oct. 18 | 12-17 yr old sAvg daily case rate per 100,000 people010203040 1.8 Vaccinated: 2 dosesVaccinated: 1 dos eUnvaccinated13.243.1HOSPITALIZATION RATES in BC Sept. 16- Oct. 15 | 12-17 yr old sAvg daily hospitalization per 1M people01234 Vaccinated: 2 dosesVaccinated: 1 dos eUnvaccinated4 1. RESEARCH Lab and animal studies before testing on humans. 2. CLINICAL TRIALS Testing on thousands of volunteers to ensure vaccines are safe and they work.3. REGULATORY APPROVAL Health Canada approved the mRNA vaccines for use in youth 12-17 years old. Data from studies were thoroughly reviewed. Product and facilities were checked for quality control. 4. EXPERT RECOMMENDATION An independent group of experts called National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) reviewed the evidence and recommended the use of mRNA vaccines in youth 12 - 17 years old . 5. ONGOING MONITORING Data are constantly monitored around the world to ensure safety and real-world effectiveness.Pfizer-BioNTech's Comirnaty 100% efficacy in youth Spikevax 100% efficacy in youth 12-17 years old No serious side-effects related to the vaccines.Trial results for mRNA vaccines Although this process can usually take years, Health Canada dedicated many more scientific resources, put in fast-track processes used for H1N1 and collaborated with international regulators to meet the urgent need. No steps were skipped.Vaccinated youth are much less likely to get sick from COVID-19 or be hospitalized: Canada's laws and regulations set high standards for vaccine safety and approval. The vaccines approved for youth have passed all the below required stages. Summary (Sept.-Oct. 2021) No hospitalizations among vaccinated youth Most cases were among unvaccinated youth, who were 24 times more likely to get COVID-19 than vaccinated youthVaccine Safety for Youth 5 things to know for 12-17 years olds Side effects are completely normal after receiving a vaccine November 8, 20213 4 5 Side effects are often part of the body's natural immune response. 99.9% of people who received the mRNA vaccines did not report any serious side effects. In very rare cases, myocarditis or pericarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle or lining) can occur. Most people recover quickly. The chance of getting myocarditis from COVID-19 is much greater than getting it from the vaccine. The medical and scientific community is confident in the long-term safety of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

Our body uses mRNA every day to tell our cells how to make proteins. This helps us perform nearly every function, like building our muscles, heart, skin and brain. Since the 1990's, mRNA has been researched for its use in medicine. Two past coronavirus outbreaks (SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012) helped us understand coronaviruses and the spike protein. The decades of research by scientists around the world, including at the University of British Columbia, helped us get effective COVID-19 vaccines to people in a much more timely manner. Vaccines teach your body how to launch its own immune response The COVID-19 vaccines work like other vaccines - by helping the body make its own natural protection without being exposed to the whole virus. 1. The mRNA tells the body to build and present a harmless protein found on the coronavirus. As with our own mRNA, the vaccine mRNA is then quickly destroyed by our cells and does not stay in the body. 2. Our immune system recognizes that this protein doesn't belong there and starts creating antibodies to fight it. 3. It then remembers and stores this information to protect us from future infection.
