JS:ss www.arkansas.gov/dhs Serving more than one million Arkansans each year Source: DAAS Website and Division of Aging and Adult ServicesHISTORY A growing nationwide awareness of the problems of the elderly--and the needs for services and assistance on their behalf--led to the passage of the Older Americans Act in 1965. This legislation created the Administration on Agingat the federal level and required that each state establish a state unit on aging to administer programs under theAct. Accordingly, Governor Orville Faubus established the Office on Aging in 1966 under the auspices of theGovernor's office. Since 1965, the Older Americans Act has been amended several times, each time expanding the role of state units on aging. Arkansas legislation also has changed the state unit's name, organization location, and its authority andfunding responsibilities. The state unit was placed within the Department of Social Services in 1971. Act 228 of1977 gave the agency divisional status and the responsibility for adult protective services was added by the GeneralAssembly in 1979. Act 348 of 1985 created the Division of Aging and Adult Services (DAAS) within the reorganizedArkansas Department of Human Services.

Southeast Arkansas DBHS-22 Source: Child Care SystemThe 86thGeneral Assembly appropriated an additional $40 million to Arkansas Better Chance for School Success State Pre-K program to serve additional children. The total funding for ABC and ABCSS is now $111million. State Maternal and Child Health Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems Grant - The Arkansas Department of Health applied for the above-mentioned grant, with DCC&ECE named as the sub-grantee and leadconvener. This is a two-year planning grant that will develop with a 10-year plan to fundamentally integratechild development, educational, and medical efforts to support at-risk young children and their families so thatchildren can enter school in optimum social-emotional health and ready to learn. The State Pre-K program, Arkansas Better Chance for School Success, received a score of 9/10 by the National Institute of Early Education Research Annual State of Preschool Yearbook. The yearbook evaluationaddressed three areas of programming: access, quality standards and resources. The Kidcare System was implemented on July 1, 2005. Its purpose is to determine eligibility for Federally subsidized child care services (Child Care Vouchers), maintain waiting lists, authorized services, and reducefraud/overpayments. The system is designed to accurately determine a client's eligibility for child care servicesbased on program specific business requirements for Low Income, Foster Care, Protective Services,Transitional Employment Assistances, and Extended Support Services. The licensed capacity for all centers and homes in Arkansas has been expanded from 117,507 in 2001 to 163,640 in 2007. This represents a growth of 38% over the past five years. The number of Quality Approvedfacilities in Arkansas has increased from 425 in 2004 to 586 in 2007, an increase of 38% during this three-yearperiod. Currently, approximately 26% of all licensed child care centers are Quality Approved. The Arkansas Better Chance program expanded to serve 18,458 preschool children in high quality early childhood settings in 2006. Efforts to support working families, educate parents and ensure high quality early care and education services for Arkansas children continue to direct the activities of the Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education(DCC&ECE). Highlights and Accomplishments During the Past Year Include: The USDA program expenditures grew from $34.2 million to $35.6 million to meet the increasing demand to serve nutritious meals to children in Arkansas. The program expenditures increase was due to growth in theChild and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) . CACFP had 426 contracts in 2006 and 481 contracts in 2007.The Special Nutrition Programs are continuing to identify and target counties with low participation or no participation. Over 28.9 million nutritious meals were served to eligible children.

Previously, funded through the Educational ExcellenceTrust Fund and a dedicated excise tax on beer, ABC programs are intended to serve educationally deprivedchildren. Children's ages range from birth through five years of age. Children are placed in developmentallyappropriate programs, including HIPPY (Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters). Eligible studentsmust have at least one of the following characteristics: low-income family, parents with low educational level, lowbirth weight, child to a teen mother, a family with a history of substance abuse/addiction, eligibility for services underPublic Law 99-457, (a family with a history of abuse or neglect, a victim of abuse or neglect, or have demonstrabledevelopmental delays as identified through an appropriate screening). ABC programs are operated by local schooldistricts, Educational Service Cooperatives, community-based non-profit centers, for-profit, Head Start andUniversity programs. Services may be home-based, such as the HIPPY program or Parents as Teachers (PAT), center-based programs, or licensed family home programs. In 2004, the Arkansas General Assembly expanded this program by $40 Millionfor the Arkansas Better Chance for School Success program. This component of ABC targeted three and four-yearold children from families with gross income of less than 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. This program hasessentially become the state funded Pre-K program in Arkansas, giving funding priority to school districts inacademic distress, districts with schools listed as being in school improvement status for two years and districts withelementary schools where more than 75% of fourth-grade students score below proficient on math and literacybenchmark exams. In 2007, the 86th General Assembly appropriated an additional $40 million which brings totalfunding to $111 million. This fulfills the commitment made to state Pre-K.

As of July 1, 2007, the Arkansas Department of Health and the Arkansas Department of Human Servicesare again separate, cabinet-level agencies. The Arkansas Department of Health has chosen to continue itspartnership with the Arkansas DHS Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education (DCCECE) under anInteragency Agreement to serve as the lead coordinator of implementation activities for the Arkansas EarlyChildhood Comprehensive Systems (ECCS) Initiative, using a State Maternal and Child Health Early ChildhoodComprehensive Systems Grant (HRSA-05-033). It is anticipated that the continued partnership will build on gains already made towards goals and objectives of the project. The purpose of the initiative is to increase the health and well-being of Arkansas's young children and theirfamilies by creating an integrated services delivery platform for all early childhood services. This will maximize theexisting investments in early childhood, and assure that Arkansas children are safe, healthy, eager to learn andready to succeed by the time they enter school. The state enters into the second year of a two-year implementationphase in the 2007-2008 funding cycle. * Parenting Supports - Parents have the information, services, and supports they need to ensure their young children are developing in healthy environments. * Availability of Services - Quality and coordinated systems of care for families and young children are available throughout the state. The implementation plan, which was approved by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, contains activities and strategies that will help accomplish the goals listed above over the next year. More information regarding the specific work as related to individual groups may be found at the website: http://www.arkansas.gov/childcare/aeccs.html.Each of the five work groups (early care and education, parent education, family support, social-emotional health, medical homes) contributed to the formulation of a comprehensive state plan, which was submitted and accepted bythe Maternal and Child Health Bureau in June of 2006. During the 2006-2007 grant cycle, work groups beginimplementing planned activities. The overall goal of the ECCS Initiative is that children in Arkansas will be healthy and ready to learn upon entering kindergarten. All five groups agreed that the following four goals are shared across all areas of concern: * Public Awareness - Families, community members, and local and state policymakers will recognize the impact that the quality of early childhood experiences has on communities. * Access to Quality - Children have access to quality and comprehensive physical and mental health care, early care & education, and opportunities for healthy social-emotional growth and development. SFY 2007ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT PROGRAM SUPPORT NEW NATIONAL INITIATIVES DCCECE-11Source: Program Support UnitIn December 2006, Arkansas completed two years as a pilot state for the National Strengthening Families Initiative. The final report was submitted in January 2007. Efforts continued to build Strengthening Families Arkansasnetwork. Arkansas participated in the Strengthening Families Leadership Summit in May of 2007, showcasing andhighlighting contributions of the seven pilot states to the overall national initiative.ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT PROGRAM SUPPORT SFY 2007 STRENGTHENING FAMILIES INITIATIVE To further expand Arkansas's readiness to support child care programs in guiding their capacity to play a role in prevention of child maltreatment, Arkansas joins eleven other states in the new State Partnerships for Prevention:Reducing the Risk of Maltreatment of Very Young Children project at ZERO TO THREE. Through this project, up to30 trainers in Arkansas will learn to use the Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect (PCAN) curriculum. Trainers willwork with child care providers in seven targeted counties and throughout the state to train them on the role they planin the prevention of child maltreatment.In March of 2006, Arkansas was awarded seed grant money from the Alliance of Children's Trust Funds ($25,000), and with matching funds is currently in the process of developing an on-line training module that will enable earlycare and education programs to fully utilize the Strengthening Families self-assessment tool. The ArkansasStrengthening Families learning network will continue to operate and its programs that participated in the initialphase will help to test the on-line module and serve as mentors to additional programs seeking to implementStrengthening Families in their own settings. The module is scheduled to be online by Fall 2007. SCHOOL READINESS INDICATORS The UALR Children's Data Center/Institute for Economic Advancement continues to gather and track school readiness indicators and provides trend data for policy planning. The ability to establish trend data that informs ourpolicy decisions occurs through use of the indicators data reports. Additional child health indicators not originallyincluded are being incorporated into future reports. The Division is working with UALR/Institute for EconomicAdvancement in preparation of an Economic Study of the impact of early care and education programs in Arkansas.This report will be finalized and issued in late Fall of 2007.NGA GOVERNOR'S SUMMIT ON EXTRA LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES The Arkansas Out of School Network (AOSN) continues to expand and increase collaboration and partnerships agreements with programs and agencies involved in school age care and youth development activities. Grantfunding from Mott Foundation will continue for another year and will support the proposed Governors Task Force onSchool Age Care.A comprehensive evaluation of the Arkansas Early Childhood Education Professional Development System is to be conducted beginning July, 1 2005. Selected to conduct this evaluation is Keystone University Research Corporationfrom Pennsylvania. The comprehensive evaluation will focus on the numerous training and professionaldevelopment opportunities offered in Arkansas and determine the effectiveness of the system of delivery.Additionally, the Research group will assist in building capacity within our own state to establish a methodology forcontinuous improvement.

Licensing specialists are currently using \"tablet\"computers. The conversion process to a \"paperless\" system should be completed by the end of the 2007 calendaryear. Additionally, the Licensing Unit recently began work with Northrop Grumman to redesign our central licensingcomputer system (CLEAN). The new system will be a web based system and should be in full operation by mid2009. In August of 2005 the Division began work on a Quality Rating System (QRS) for licensed center and home child care providers. This system will consist initially of three tiers above the current level of the minimum licensingrequirements. Providers qualifying for the levels above minimum licensing will be entitled to incentives such asgrants and higher levels of reimbursement through the Child Care Voucher Program. Implementation of the QRS istentativel y scheduled to occur in late 2008 or earl y 2009 . The Unit continues to strive for the reduction in duplication of efforts, to improve both the safety of children in childcare and to increase the number of quality accredited programs.The Licensing and Accreditation Unit is responsible for licensing all child care situations where more than five (5) children are cared for, for maintaining the Voluntary Registry for persons providing care to five (5) or fewer childrenwho choose to be registered and for administering the Quality Approval System. The Unit inspects most licensedcenters and all licensed and registered homes a minimum of three (3) times per year. Some licensed centers suchas those with quality accreditation and high levels of compliance are monitored two times per year. Technicalassistance and consultative services are provided to licensed and registered programs, applicants and parents andto programs who have applied for Quality Approval or are already Quality Approved sites. The Unit investigates complaints of non-compliance on licensed and registered child care facilities. The Unit also assists the Crimes Against Children Division, of the Arkansas State Police and the Division of Children and FamilyServices, in the investigation of child maltreatment complaints in these facilities. The Licensing Unit is responsiblefor processing and tracking background checks on all child care owners/operators and employees through the FBI,the State Police and the Arkansas Child Maltreatment Central Registry. Licensing staff members insure thatappropriate corrective action is taken on any persons found to have a record of child maltreatment and that personswho have a conviction of a prohibited offense are removed from child care. The Child Care Licensing Unit was placed with the Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education following passage of Act 1132 in 1997. The Residential Placement Unit, previously a part of the Licensing Unit, remainedwith the Division of Children and Famil y Services. In 1997 the Child Care Licensing Unit shifted to open-ended licenses and reduced time frames for processing new applications for licensure from sixty (60) to less than thirty (30) days. During 2005, licensing standards for child carecenters, child care family homes and registered child care family homes were reviewed and revised. The revisionprocess was completed in October 2005, and the newly printed requirements were distributed to providers, with afinal publication date of Februar y 2006.

In State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2007, 26,817 reports of abuse and neglect were investigated. Of these reports of abuse and neglect, 6,946 (26%) were determined to be true, 19,871 (74%) were unsubstantiated. Of thereports accepted for investigation, 20,625 (77%) were assigned to DCFS. When an investigation is determined to be true, DCFS opens a protective service case and works with the child(ren) and family in the home or, if the abuse is severe, DCFS places the child in a safe and home-likesetting. In SFY 2007, DCFS served 22,531 children in 10,103 families in this capacity. The purpose of servicesis to provide the child with a continuous, safe and stable living environment, promote family autonomy, strengthenfamily life where possible and promote the reunification of the child with the parent, guardian or custodian, whenapplicable.ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT THE DIVISION OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES INTRODUCTION SFY 2007 The Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS) Arkansas State Police (Crimes Against Children Division ) DCFS County Staff Protective ServicesIn 1997, DHHS and the Arkansas State Police entered into a contractual agreement that formed the Family Protection Unit now known as the Crimes Against Children Division (CACD). The CACD is composed of twosections: 1) the Child Abuse Hotline, and 2) civilian employees who assess child maltreatment reports. TheCACD maintains an around-the-clock statewide intake process (The Child Abuse Hotline) for accepting reports ofalleged child maltreatment. The CACD's civilian employees are responsible for assessing Priority l allegations ofsevere maltreatment, involving severe physical and sexual abuse. They also conduct investigations ofmaltreatment in DCFS foster homes and pre-adoptive homes. CACD completed (23%) investigations inSFY 2007. DCFS staff housed in DHHS county offices assesses allegations of child maltreatment in which the perpetrator is in the home and not the specific responsibility of CACD. DCFS staff in the county office has primaryresponsibility for assessing an allegation of child maltreatment and seeks to ascertain the existence, cause,nature and extent of child maltreatment, the existence of previous injuries and the names and conditions of otherchildren in the home. DCFS remains primarily responsible for ensuring the health and safety of the children, evenif the primary responsibility for the investigation belongs to the CACD. DCFS has the responsibility for theassessment of Priority II reports. The Child Maltreatment Assessment Protocol (PUB-357) is used for screening and prioritizing all allegations of child maltreatment. This protocol is used when a DCFS Family Service Worker (FSW) or the CACD conducts aChild Maltreatment Assessment. It identifies and defines the various types of child maltreatment a FSW/CACDworker may encounter during an assessment. The protocol also identifies when and from whom an allegation ofchild maltreatment may be taken. Finally, it identifies those conditions which must be met before an allegation ofabuse or neglect can be founded (determined to be true).In addition, DCFS investigates Priority I reports of abandonment, failure to protect, medical neglect of disabled infants, failure to thrive, malnutrition and substantial possibility of severe maltreatment. DCFS-1The Children's Reporting System used the following methodology to identify a foster child: Source: Division of Children and Family ServicesINTRODUCTION SFY 2007 CHRIS was implemented in December 1997 as DCFS' worker-based information system and source of data for state, federal and management reports. Data described in this report was pulled from the CHRIS system.This unit serves as the repository of all child maltreatment reports. The Child Maltreatment Reporting Act requires that a statewide central registry be established within the Department of Health and Human Services(DHHS) for the collection of information relative to the child maltreatment reports. The registry containsidentifying data, dates and circumstances of any persons requesting or receiving information from the registry.There were 55,549 registry checks made in SFY 2007. When there is no abuse or neglec tpresent, but a famil yrequests services, DCFS opens a Supportive Services case. In SFY 2007, DCFS served 1,374 children in 686 families. There are a limited number of situations when children cannot safely remain at home and must be separated from their family. When a child must be separated from the family, DCFS will provide a healthy and safeenvironment and will make appropriate and timely efforts to provide services to reunite the family. In 2007, DCFSplaced 7,194 in substitute care settings: Kinship Care, Foster Care, Therapeutic Foster Care, Residential Care,Shelters , etc. All children deserve a permanent home. One option is to terminate parental rights to free a child for adoptive placement when it has been determined to be in the best interest of the child. In SFY 2007, there were 357children placed in ado ptive homes. When a child has been removed and needs a foster home placement, DCFS places the child in an approved foster home. The approval process ensures that a potential foster parent attends training and meets health,safety, and physical requirements and satisfies other standards outlined in the Standards forApproval ofFoster Family Homes . In SFY 2007, there were 231 new foster homes approved, resulting in a total of 968 foster homes in Arkansas.ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT THE DIVISION OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES The Famil yResource Centers (FRC) are community-based and famil yfocused and offer services directed toward prevention, intervention, and alleviation of community identified problems.

Act 348 of 1985 authorized the reorganization of the Department of Human Services, and under this change DDS became one of 13 divisions/offices comprising an integrated services system. This Act designated control andadministration of the HDCs under the management and direction of the DDS Board with daily operation authorityextended to the DDS Director, in coordination with the Director of DHHS. To accomplish its mission, DDS, the DDS Board, and its providers are committed to the principle and practices of normalization; least restrictive alternatives; affirmation of individuals' constitutional rights; provision of qualityservices; the interdisciplinary service delivery model; and the positive management of challenging behaviors.Background, Services and Mission DDS also provides an extensive range of services to individuals in community settings. These services are provided through private, not-for-profit programs whose service areas include all 75 counties of the state. There are 92 DDSLicensed Providers and 78 Early Intervention Voucher Providers. Additionally, DDS offers wrap-around services,which include Medicaid Waiver, individual/family supports and adaptive equipment. In 1971, the Governor designated Mental Retardation/Developmental Disabilities Services to administer the provisions of the Developmental Disabilities Services (DDS) and the Facilities Construction Act, or Public Law 91-517, (as amended). This legislation expanded the responsibility of the agency to serve individuals with cerebralpalsy, epilepsy, and autism. In 1981, Act 513 was passed and changed the name and official title of the agency and Board to the Division and the Board of Developmental Disabilities Services. Under this Act, the Arkansas Children's Colonies became theHuman Development Centers (HDCs). There are six HDCs across the state; the first opened in 1959 at Conway,and the last opened in 1978 in Warren. The HDCs are located in Conway, Alexander, Arkadelphia, Jonesboro,Booneville, and Warren. These programs provide services to 1,098 individuals (as of 07/30/07) with developmentaldisabilities who are in need of 24-hour residential, medical, and habilitative services. In 1955, the Arkansas General Assembly created the Arkansas Children's Colony with the passage of Act 6. This act has been revised and extended by numerous statutes, the latest being Act 1165 of 1975. Act 265 of 1969created the Arkansas Department of Mental Retardation. It also expanded the authority of the Children's ColonyBoard to include certain responsibilities for the individuals who, because of other disabilities, show characteristics ofmental retardation.

Medicaid furnishes medical assistance to those whohave insufficient incomes and resources to meet the costs of necessary medical services. It alsoprovides rehabilitative and other services to help families and individuals become or remainindependent and able to care for themselves. The Department o fHealth & Human Services (DHHS) is the single state agenc yauthorized and responsible for regulating and administering the program. DHHS administers the Medicaid Programthrough the Division of Medical Services (DMS). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS) administers the Medicaid Program for the U.S. Department of Human Services. CMSauthorizes federal funding levels and approves each state's State Plan, ensuring compliance withfederal regulations. Individuals are certified as eligible for Medicaid services by DHHS Field Stafflocated in DHHS County Offices or by District Social Security Offices.

Under this program, eligible recipients may obtain prescription medication through any of the 876 enrolledpharmacies in the state. During SFY 2007, a total of 415,352 Medicaid recipients used prescription drugbenefits. A total of 4.5 million prescriptions were reimbursed by Arkansas Medicaid for cost of $299.4 milliondollars thus making the average cost per prescription approximately $66. An average cost for a brand nameprescription was $112 dollars, although representing 47% of the claims it accounted for 79% of expenditures.The average cost for a generic prescription was $27 dollars, representing 53% of claims and accounted for 21%of expenditures. The Prescription Drug Program restricts each recipient to a maximum of three prescriptions per month, with the capability of getting up to six prescriptions by prior authorization, except for recipients under 21 and certified Long - Term Care recipients who receive unlimited prescriptions per month. Persons eligible under the Assisted Living Waiver are allowed up to nine prescriptions per month. Beginning January 1, 2006 full benefit dual eligibles began to receive drug coverage through the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 rather than through ArkansasMedicaid. Arkansas Medicaid is required to pay Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) the State Contibutionfor Prescription Drug Benefit, sometimes referred to as the Medicare Part D Clawback. This payment for SFY2007 was $34.2 Million. Medicaid reimbursement for prescription drugs is based on cost plus a dispensing fee. Drug costs are established and based upon a pharmacy's estimated acquisition cost (EAC), the federally established genericupper limit (GUL) or state established upper limit (SUL). Arkansas Medicaid has a dispensing fee $5.51 as established by the Division of Medical Services and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS).The EAC and dispensing fee are based upon surveys that determine an average cost for dispensing aprescription and the average ingredient cost. In March of 2002 we established a differential fee of $2.00 wasapplied to generic prescriptions for which there is not an upper limit.

The Medical Need Determination Unit processed approximately 1,037 Medicaid nursing facility applications per month while maintaining approximately 12,395 active cases and processing over 3,500 changes of conditionrequests during the year. Also processed were 3,351 applications/reviews for ICFs/MR. In addition, over 11,640applications/reviews for other medical programs within DHHS were made during SFY 07. The OLTC Complaint Unit staffs a registered nurse and licensed social worker that record the initial intake of complaints against long-term care facilities. Many times issues are resolved with immediate satisfaction to theparties involved. When that is not possible, the OLTC performs an on-site complaint investigation. The OLTCreceived 861 nursing home complaints during SFY 07 regarding the care or conditions in long term care facilities.

In 1977, the Office was established by Act 865 to assess andrecognize the needs of communities throughout Arkansas and train volunteer coordinators and volunteer organizations in meeting those needs. The division also continues to assist in special projects to meet community needs and to provide greater public awareness and recognition of volunteer efforts. In 1983, the Office of Volunteer Services transferred from the Office of the Governor to the Department of Human Services (DHS). AR Code 25-10- 102 officially made the agency a Division of DHS . The mission of the Division of Volunteerism (DOV) is to promote and support national service and volunteering in Arkansas. AR Code \u00a725-10-128 (Act 1259 of 1997) expanded the duties of the Division of Volunteerism (DOV) to include assistance to the DHS Division of County Operations with welfare reform initiatives. The Economic Impact of Arkansas Volunteers: Each year DOV publishes the study \"THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF ARKANSAS VOLUNTEERS\". The results of the most recent study are as follows: Seven hundred and eighty (780) volunteer organizations reported a total of 29,577,467 hours for an estimated total dollar value of $580,094,672 . Had the State of Arkansas paid for the time involved to provide the services donated by volunteers, an additional $11,380,448,499 in personal income would have been required to generate that sum in general revenues. Arkansas' Promise: Arkansas' Promise supports efforts for youth to give back to thei rcommunities through the placement o ftwelve (12) AmeriCorps Promise Fellows in various communities.

Maximize the potential contributions made by consumers as citizens and taxpayers.Arkansas Act 393 of 1975 amended Arkansas Act 38 of 1971 to require that the functions, powers and duties of the Rehabilitation Services for the Blind be located within an Office for the Blind and Visually Impaired in the Division ofRehabilitation Services. Act 393 gave the Office for the Blind and Visually Impaired statutory authority and legalauthority to promulgate rules, and established an Advisory Committee appointed by the Governor. In 1983, a number of consumer, education, and service organizations identified a critical need for specialized services to visually impaired and blind Arkansans. In response to this concern, the Governor and Legislatureestablished the Division of Services for the Blind (DSB) under Act 481. Although previously Arkansas had offeredseparate services for blind and visually impaired persons, Act 481 provided that the agency should be governed by apolicy-making board, the majority of whom must be blind persons. Within the past decade, DSB has beencommended for innovative programming, consumer responsiveness, and consistently high performance in therehabilitation of severely disabled persons. DSB functions both as a direct service provider and as a consumer agent in locating and purchasing quality services (including medical and educational services; equipment or supplies related to self-sufficiency; job placement oremployment services; etc.). All direct services are made available to consumers in their own communities. DSB serves consumers through three interdependent units: Field Services ,Vending Facility Program , and the DSB Directors Office . These three service units were designed by the DSB Board to offer two advantages to the State of Arkansas: Enhance the personal self-sufficiency of consumers eliminating costs associated with unnecessary skilled care.During the 1940's and early 1950's, rudimentary services for blind people were provided by \"home teachers\" who were employed by the Arkansas Department of Welfare. In 1955, services to blind people were transferred to theArkansas Rehabilitation Services, then in the Department of Education. Arkansas Rehabilitation Services for the Blind was created in 1965 by Arkansas Act 180. This Act established a Division of Rehabilitation Services for the Blind within the State Board for Vocational Education. All services for theblind were transferred to said Division from the Arkansas Rehabilitation Services. Act 38 of 1971 transferred the functions, powers and duties of the Rehabilitation Services for the Blind to the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (now the Department of Human Services) and placed them in theDivision of Rehabilitation Services.Agency History ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF SERVICES FOR THE BLIND INTRODUCTION SFY 2007 DSB-11. 2. 3.

Vocational Rehabilitation- The objective of the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program is to ensure that qualified blind and visually impaired persons work in appropriate careers and become as personally and economically independent as possible. The program assesses consumer needs, plans appropriate services based upon informedconsumer choice, and develops and provides cost-effective services for individuals who are blind or severely visuallyimpaired. Consumers usually range in age from 14 to 64. The vocational rehabilitation services provided areconsistent with the strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities and informed choice of thedisabled individual. To be eligible for DSB services, the individual must have a visual disability. The visual disability must be a substantial impediment to employment. It must be determined that the individual with the visual disability can benefitfrom vocational rehabilitation services in the achievement of a vocational outcome. Additionally, the individualrequires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, engage in, or retain gainful employment. After an individualis determined eligible for vocational rehabilitation, services are provided based on the DSB Order of Selection criteria. Priority is given to the individual with the most significant visual disability. In SFY 2007, DSB served 1,420 vocational rehabilitation consumers, of which 100% were severely disabled. Of this number, 357 blind orseverely visually impaired individuals successfully achieved employment outcomes.
