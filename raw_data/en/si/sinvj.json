The vibrations of a balanced energy field maintain physical, emotional, mental and spiritual well-being. The Chinese call this energy Qi (Chee), and the Japanese Ki (Key). A person's energy can become blocked or imbalanced by stress, anxiety and challenging life events resulting in illnesses. Energy Balancing Techniques (EBT) applied through light hands-on touch, sound, and vibration restores the balance of energy within the body, mind and spirit. Benefits of Energy Balancing: Clients have reported feeling skin tingling, muscle twitches and heat or cold coming from the practitioner's hands. With their eyes closed, some clients see different color swirls, experience mini dreams or emotional releases, and random thoughts. Some clients do not experience anything at all except a restful, peaceful hour. However, at the conclusion of a session all clients report feeling a sense of well-being, calm, and peace. Reiki - An Ancient Healing Technique: Reiki is a system of hands-on energy healing. It originated in Tibet, and is referred to in 2500-year-old Sanskrit writings. It was rediscovered in the nineteenth century by a Japanese monk named Dr. Mikao Usui, and the Usui System of Natural Healing has been passed down by Reiki Masters since that time. Today, Usui Reiki is practiced worldwide. The word \"Reiki\" is of Japanese origin. The first syllable, \"rei,\" is variously translated as \"God,\" \"universal,\" or \"cosmic.\" The second syllable, \"ki,\" means the fundamental life force flowing and pulsating in all living things. There are different words for this fundamental force in all the different cultures and religions of the world, but hands-on energy healing is not affiliated with any one religion or religious practice. Reiki is classified as an energy therapy. It is administered by \"laying on hands\" and is based on the idea that an unseen \"life force energy\" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If one's \"life force energy\" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress. If it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy. Reiki is based on the idea that energy is transmitted through the Reiki practitioner from a universal energy source to the client to raise or improve the flow of the client's life-force energy, or ki. Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It also works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery. In the practice of Reiki, the Reiki practitioner serves as a conduit for the natural healing energy. The laying on of the hands directs the healing energy wherever it is needed most by the receiver. No personal energy is drawn or drained from the practitioner. The Reiki practitioner may also remove negative energy from the client, again by acting as a conduit. Human beings are a totality of soul, mind, and body. Therefore the Reiki healing also treats the spiritual and mental causes of an illness, not just the physical symptoms. Symptoms merely show us that something in the body is not functioning properly. Reiki has a positive effect on your spiritual and emotional balance. It brings the receiver directly into contact with the Creative Intelligence and the infinite energy of the universe. Reiki Is Not A Religion: While Reiki is spiritual in nature, it is not a religion. It has no dogma, and there is nothing you must believe in order to learn and use Reiki. In fact, Reiki is not dependent on belief at all and will work whether you believe in it or not. Because Reiki comes from God, many people find that using Reiki enables them to go beyond intellectual concepts and directly experience their religion. While Reiki is not a religion, it is still important to live and act in a way that promotes harmony with others. Dr. Mikao Usui, the founder of the Reiki system of natural healing, recommended that one practice certain simple ethical ideals to promote peace and harmony, which are nearly universal across all cultures. The Ideals were developed to add spiritual balance to Usui Reiki. Their purpose is to help people realize that healing the spirit by consciously deciding to improve oneself is a necessary part of the Reiki healing experience. In order for the Reiki healing energies to have lasting results, the client must accept responsibility for his or her healing and take an active part in it. Therefore, the Usui system of Reiki is more than the use of the Reiki energy. It must also include an active commitment to improve oneself in order for it to be a complete system. The ideals are both guidelines for living a gracious life and virtues worthy of practice for their inherent value. - The secret art of inviting happiness - The miraculous medicine of all diseases - Just for today, do not anger - Do not worry and be filled with gratitude - Devote yourself to your work. Be kind to people. - Every morning and evening, join your hands in prayer. - Pray these words to your heart - and chant these words with your mouth - Usui Reiki Treatment for the improvement of body and mind What Is A Treatment Or Session Like? The client is usually in sitting or lying position, fully clothed. A standard Reiki treatment includes placing the hands above, or on, the head, shoulders, stomach and feet. The Reiki practitioner may also use hand positions around the body to ensure that no parts of the body are neglected. Each position is held 2 to 5 minutes and the entire treatment lasts 45 to 90 minutes. Energy automatically goes to the parts of the body where it's most needed, and intention on the part of the Reiki practitioner is believed to help direct the flow of energy. A treatment creates a wonderful radiance that is deeply relaxing and includes many beneficial effects for both client and practitioner. At the very least, you will feel very relaxed during a session, often to the point of falling asleep. A Reiki session always seems to impress those who say they find it difficult to relax. As in other forms of energy healing, a Reiki practitioner can also \"send\" a treatment to another person who is not in the same room or location. This is usually called Distant Reiki. How Does REIKI Work? Reiki is an amazing energy that comes from the highest spiritual source. It has its own intelligence and knows exactly where to go and what to do. It is multi-dimensional and will heal the cause of a problem on whatever level it may exist - body, mind, or spirit. It does not have to be directed by the practitioner. Because it is a channeled healing, the Reiki practitioner's energies are never depleted. In fact, when giving a treatment, the Reiki practitioner is healed as well and always experiences an increase in life-force energy. People that already do healing work report their healing energies increase by at least 50% after receiving Reiki training. Side Effects And Safety Issues: There are no known safety concerns with Reiki. However, it should not be used to replace necessary standard medical treatment. "}
