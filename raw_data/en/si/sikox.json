Immune support, unlike a specific treatment, relies on the ability of the body to illicit its own response against a pathogen, in this case a virus. However, it is not a targeted treatment as what exists for flu virus (Tamiflu) or herpes viruses (acyclovir/valacyclovir). Immune support is designed to help boost the body's ability to resist and fight infection and is not a replacement for vaccines or specific anti-viral medications that may emerge in the future. Immune Response and COVID 19 The first stage of fighting an infection requires the immune system to ramp up a response and clear the virus. This can take a few days to several weeks and requires the body to become inflamed to fight the infection. This is not specific to COVID-19. This is an appropriate response which we WANT our immune system to do. The risk with COVID-19, and other pathogens, is when the inflammation response goes unchecked and can start to excessively damage our own tissue. This can lead to accumulation of fluid in the lungs and ultimately more complications. Those at risk for this extreme inflammatory response include those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disorders such as COPD, asthma, and restrictive lung disease. Select natural products are helpful to balance this excessive inflammatory response.
