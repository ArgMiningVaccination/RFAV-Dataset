[Print this page](#) Giving CPR1 CHECK the scene for safety, form an initial impression and use personal protective equipment (PPE) 2 If the person appears unresponsive, CHECK for responsiveness, breathing, life-threatening bleeding or other life-threatening conditions using shout-tap-shout 3 If the person does not respond and is not breathing or only gasping, CALL 9-1-1 and get equipment, or tell someone to do so 4 Kneel beside the person. Place the person on their back on a firm, flat surface 5 Give 30 chest compressions - Hand position: Two hands centered on the chest - Body position: Shoulders directly over hands; elbows locked - Depth: At least 2 inches - Rate: 100 to 120 per minute - Allow chest to return to normal position after each compression 6 Give 2 breaths - Open the airway to a past-neutral position using the head-tilt/chin-lift technique - Pinch the nose shut, take a normal breath, and make complete seal over the person's mouth with your mouth. - Ensure each breath lasts about 1 second and makes the chest rise; allow air to exit before giving the next breath Note: If the 1st breath does not cause the chest to rise, retilt the head and ensure a proper seal before giving the 2nd breath If the 2nd breath does not make the chest rise, an object may be blocking the airway 7 Continue giving sets of 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. Use an AED as soon as one is available! Minimize interruptions to chest compressions to less than 10 seconds.
