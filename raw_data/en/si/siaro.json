Credits Bredesen to the General Assembly............................................................... xii i Transmittal Letter, Commissioner of Finance an d Administration to Governor Bredesen ..........................xix Administration Priorities .......... xxvii xxv Administration Priorities In the last two years, Governor Bredesen ha s established the state' s fiscal footing through budget discipline and tighter management of our state's resources. For the third year in a row, we are submitting a balanced, sensible and well-rounded budget with no new taxes to the General Assembly. The Governor's priorities again focus on making education our state's fundamental priority and taking the next steps in j ob creation and economic development, public safety, and making our state government focu sed and more responsive to its citizens. A fiscally balanced budget is important, but so is a budget that balan ces all of the state's priorities for the benefit of all Tennesseans. This budget does that. This has involved tough choices and difficult decisions, includi ng substantially changi ng TennCare to avoid bankrupting the state. While the Governor's final proposal was not the one he initially wanted, he was left no choice and he took the most responsible path given the legal and economic circumstances facing the state. Ev en after tough cuts are made to TennCare, Tennessee will still have the 7 th most comprehensive Medicaid program in the country and a common sense budget that moves our state forward on the right path to an even greater future. Governor Bredesen will conti nue to make state government mo re efficient and responsive by keeping focused on the fundamentals, including children's issues, education, economic opportunity, the environment, health care, and safe and healthy communities. He believes strongly that st ate government cannot do everything and that we need to continue to develop partnerships acro ss our communities with local governments, businesses, civic groups, religi ous groups and individuals to better serve our citizens. NEXT STEPS - Education The Governor will take the next steps in st rengthening our state's education system by launching a Voluntary Pre-K program for ev ery 4-year-old in Tennessee. He will substantially expand our state's pilot project with the goal of eventually integrating this program into the state's education funding formula, the Basic Education Program (or BEP). xxvi K-12 education is an investment in Tennessee' s future. Governor Bredesen will continue to fully fund the Basic Education Program and increase BEP funding for at-risk students across the state. To build on the teacher sala ry improvements of the last year, he will launch the Governor's \"Institute for Leader ship and Training\" to provide year-round professional development for teachers, administrators and school leaders. NEXT STEPS - Jobs and the Economy Governor Bredesen believes creating more and better job opportunities is a key to improving life in Tennessee. He will conti nue to focus on job creation with a goal of \"modernizing the tool kit we use to sustain and build new industry in Tennessee.\" That includes investments in Tennesseans through trai ning and re-training wo rkers for the jobs of tomorrow, along with an expansion of our in frastructure to foster competitiveness for new industry statewide. Tennessee must diversify in order to compet e in a rapidly changing economy. Governor Bredesen created a Jobs Cabine t to coordinate efforts at the highest levels of state government to create better-paying, higher- skilled jobs for working Tennesseans and created an Office of Diversity Business Enterp rise to serve as a point of service and information clearinghouse for small busine sses, including minority- and women-owned businesses. Governor Bredesen will c ontinue to put a laser-like focus on the development of all Tennessee communities. NEXT STEPS - Public Safety Methamphetamine abuse is a clear and present danger to the future of our state and we must move quickly to defeat this plague. Governor Bredesen will introduce comprehensive legislation to broaden the state's attack on methamphetamine abuse. Developed based on recommendations provided by a Governor-appointed task force on meth, the bill will include new limits on the sa le of cold and sinus products containing pseudoephedrine, a vital ingredient in the meth-making process. It also will propose further enhancements of criminal penalties rela ting to meth use, particularly the \"personal use\" loophole that allows for lighter penaltie s in cases in which meth cooks claim they are manufacturing only for personal use. NEXT STEPS - Government Efficiency The Bredesen Administration has substantiall y trimmed inefficient and unnecessary parts of state government through departmental budg et cuts. We will build on this foundation with initiatives designed to increase the effi ciency of state government, making it more responsive, more flexible and more user-fri endly to its customers, the taxpayers of Tennessee. That includes a streamlining of th e driver's licensing process to decrease delays and an in-depth evaluation of state government to weed out unnecessary bureaucracy. We will work hard to make sure our citizens are treated as customers, the same way they would be in the private sector. State of Tennessee The Budget Document Introduction xxvii Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 9-4- 5106, requires that the financial plan of Tennessee's state government be presented in four parts: 1. Financial Policy - The state's financial policy, contrasting the relationships between expenditures and revenues from all sources that are estimated for the ensuing fiscal year, with the corresponding figures for the latest completed fiscal year and the fiscal year in progress; and a budget summary; 2. State Appropriations and Taxes, Excluding Dedicated Funds - Appropriations and tax estimates from general state tax sources, excluding appropriations from dedicated tax sources; this is the so-called \"State Taxpayers Budget\"; 3. Detailed Budget Estimates - Estimates of expenditures and revenues, including all funding sources; program statements and performance measures; statement of the state's bonded indebtedness, detailing redemption requirements until retirement, the net and gross debt of the state, and condition of the sinking fund; and 4. Appropriations Bill and Other Budget Bills - The General Appropriations Bill, through which the General Assembly gives legal sanction to the financial plan it adopts. Upon passage, this bill appropriates by agency and fund the expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year. The revenues by which these expenditures are financed also are detailed in this bill. In addition, other bills required to give legal sanction to the financial plan must be filed. Parts one, two, and three are included in the Budget Document. The format of the Budget Document is reviewed annually for clarity and content. Part four, the Appropriations Bill and other budget legislation, such as the Bond Authorization Bill, are separate documents. The \"Introduction\" section of the Budget Document begins with transmittal letters from the Governor to the General Assembly and from the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to the Governor. These letters summarize the policy and financial recommendations included in the document. Following the transmittal letters is a statement of the Administration's priorities. The next section of the Budget Document, entitled \"Budget Overview,\" is a brief summary of the total budget. This overview is a series of charts and schedules that summarize the Budget. The total state budget and the General Fund budget are represented by pie charts that detail each major tax and each functional area for the recommended budget. Tennessee's current tax structure has the majority of its tax revenue coming from the sales tax, the largest portion of which funds education. The overview schedules clarify and detail the expenditures, revenue sources, and personnel requirements of state government. The Budget Document has several total budget schedules comparing programs by funding source and showing how those funds are derived. Also included are tables that list, by department, the improvements proposed for the next fiscal year. There are two charts that provide the total fund balance available, indicating the appropriation requirements and the General Fund and Education Fund revenues and The Budget Document xxviii reserves available to meet that need: \"General Fund and Education Fund, Comparison of Appropriation Requirements and State Revenues\" for the current year and next (or recommended budget) year. The two charts show how the budget is balanced against General Fund and Education Fund tax revenues for the two fiscal years. Because of its dedicated funding sources, the Department of Transportation's appropriation requirements and revenue sources are stated on a separate chart. All agencies and departments are included in the summary comparison schedules by program and funding source. Other schedules provide detail on the supplemental appropriations required to maintain programs in the current fiscal year, the Constitutional spending limitation requirement, and a summary of personnel and funding for all state agencies and higher education institutions. The Budget Document also includes an historical analysis of the effect on the state budget of federal aid tr ends and federally mandated costs. The section entitled \"State Tax Revenues\" presents state tax revenue estimates for the ensuing fiscal year, compared with actual collections for the previous year and the revised estimate for the current year. This section explains the various sources of revenue, by collecting agency, and the statutory apportionment among the various funds: the General Fund, Education Fund, Highway Fund, Sinking (or Debt Service) Fund, and Cities and Counties Fund. Included in the \"Financial Statements\" section are the comparative balance sheets for the General Fund, Education Fund, and Highway Fund as of June 30 for the two prior years. This schedule is followed by the expenditures and requirements of the Debt Service Fund for the previous, current, and subsequent fiscal years. A Debt Service Fund comparative balance sheet also is included. The status of the various authorized and unissued bonds is given in a schedule of bonds and appropriations made for capital purposes in lieu of bond issuance. The statement of bonded indebtedness presents the retirement schedule for the state's bonded debt. The cost of outstanding bonds is reflected as principal and interest. The proposed capital outlay for the ensuing fiscal year is included within the \"Capital Outlay Program\" section. Specific projects are shown for each department impacted, along with capital maintenance. Whether from current funds of the general fund, the sale of general obligation bonds, or from other sources, the proposed funding for each project is indicated. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" section is included to distinguish between state appropriations from general state taxes and appropriations from dedicated taxes and fees, which are narrowly levied and earmarked for specific purposes. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" excludes the dedicated funds, federal revenues, and other departmental revenues; it reports only appropriations from general state tax sources, along with estimates of the general taxes. Except for the \"State Taxpayers Budget,\" all of the other summary charts and program statements in this Budget Document that deal with appropriations in clude appropriations from all state sources, both general taxes and dedicated taxes and fees. The major portion of the Budget Document is \"Program Statements by Functional Area.\" For presentation in the Budget Document, departments and agencies with related missions, programs, goals, and objectives are grouped, resulting in six functional areas. This enables legislators, policy-makers, and citizens to have a better concept of the magnitude and costs of services provided through the various functional areas of state government. At the beginning of each functional presentation is an introduction to the associated agencies, followed by a list of the improvement items that are recommended for The Budget Document xxix that area of state government. The improvement list is followed by tables that show the total expenditures, funding sources, and personnel of each functional area. The activities and responsibilities of the departments and agencies are explained through narrative descriptions of each program. Following this narrative, fiscal and personnel data are provided for the last completed year, the current year, and the next year. The next-year estimates include the level of funding and number of positions for the recommended base budget, program improvements, and the total recommended. Volume 2 of the Budget Document, \"Performance-Based Budget for Selected Agencies and Supplementary Information,\" includes a budget process explanation; a basis of budgeting and accounting explanation; a Tennessee characteristics chart; and a Tennessee program history, focused on children, education, economic opportunity, public health, homeland security, and natural resources; the performance-based budget for agencies officially ph ased into performance- based budgeting; program performance measures for most agencies not officially phased into performance-based budgeting; and other program information for most agencies.

The Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee prepared this summary of current economic conditions and expectations for short-term economic growth in Tennessee and the nation. For additional information, see the most recent edition of \"An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee.\" The state's ability to fund services is heavily influenced by the economic environment. A reminder is the recent recession of 2001 when state revenues across the country collapsed. Economic conditions have improved markedly since then and most states have enjoyed much stronger growth in tax collections. This brief section is intended to place the budget outlook in the broader context of st ate and national economic conditions. For greater detail on the state and national economic outlook, see the most recent issue of An Annual Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee . Recent Economic Conditions - While it's no longer a so-called \"jobless recovery,\" the current economic expansion remains characterized by weak growth in jobs. There has been improvement in the labor market situation with further improvement on the horizon. After shedding jobs at a 0.3 percent pace in 2003, the US economy saw jobs grow by 1.0 percent in 2004. The nation's manufacturing sector continues to struggle, but things have improved. On the heels of a 4.8 percent setback in 2003, the nation's rate of job decay in manufacturing abated to 1.0 percent in 2004. Most other barometers of economic activity have performed reasonably well. Gross domestic product and personal income continue to grow at healthy rates, and the unemployment rate for 2004 was down one-half of a percentage point from the previous year. The employment situation in Tennessee improved as well in 2004 with overall job growth of 0.9 percent, well ahead of the 0.1 percent rate of growth of the previous year. Like the nation, the manufacturing sector has been a drag on overall economic activity and job growth in the state. But also like th e nation, there has been significant improvement. In 2003, manufacturing jobs were down 3.4 percent, but the loss in 2004 was trimmed to 0.1 percent. The service sector has been the key source of job creation for the state economy going back to the recession. Unemployment rates are falling, and the average for 2004 was almost a percentage point below the average in 2003. The state unemployment rate continues to rest below its national counterpart. Short-term Economic Outlook - The national economy is projected to see slightly lower rates of growth in gross domestic product in 2005 and 2006, while personal income growth is expected to improve slightly. Labor markets will show some renewed strength. The national unemployment rate is forecast at 5.3 percent for 2005 and 2006, down from prevailing rates. Nonfarm job growth will also improve and register 1.8 percent and 1.5 percent growth in 2005 and 2006. Manufacturing job growth will move back into the black, buoyed in part by a falling dollar in international currency markets. The prime interest rate will rise to 6.0 percent in 2005 and 6.6 percent in the following year. Inflation should remain in check and fall below 2.0 percent. Tennessee is also expected to see an improvement in its labor market. Nonagricultural jobs are projected to grow 1.5 and 1.8 percent in 2005 and 2006. And manufacturing should register positive growth for the first time since 1998. Nominal personal income will be up 5.5 percent in 2005 and 5.4 percent in 2006. On a fiscal year basis, expect income growth of 5.1 percent in 2004-05 and 5.6 percent in 2005-06.

State of Tennessee Federal Aid Trends and Federal Mandate Costs Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2005 - 2006 1980 82 84 86 88 1990 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 06TANF/AFDCFood StampsMedicaidAll OtherTotal0123456Figure 1 Federal Aid Trend in State Programs FY 1980 through FY 2006 in Billions of Constant (2005-2006) Dollars Since fiscal year 1979-80, federal aid to Tennessee excluding Food Stamps, Medicaid, and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) grants, formerly Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), has declined from 27 cents of every dollar in the state budget to 23 cents in 2005-2006. If the state were still receiving 27 cents of every budgeted dollar as federal aid, an additional $584.6 million would be available in federal funds. In constant (2005-2006) dollars, federal aid has increased by 100.8 percent, or $1.7 billion, from 1979-80 to 2005-2006 for state programs other than Food Stamps, Medicaid, and TANF/AFDC grants. Figure 1 and Table 1 show the constant (2005-2006) dollar trend in federal aid in the state budget since 1979-80 for all programs, including transportation. Amounts for fiscal years 1979-80 through 2003-2004 are based on actual federal aid collections; amounts for 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 are based on estimates included in the recommended state budget. Current dollars have been converted to real (constant) dollars using the gross domestic product implicit price deflator, as reported by the University of Tennessee, Center for Business and Economic Research. The decline in federal aid in the early 1980s (Figure 1) reflects the elimination of federal revenue sharing for states, new federal restrictions on eligibility for the TANF/AFDC program, and the con-solidation of several federal grant programs into block grants at reduced levels. From 1988-89 to 2005- 2006, all the programs other than TANF/AFDC have had real growth. This reflects congressional decisions in the late 1980s to relax the earlier federal deficit-control statutes, which had restrained the growth of domestic discretionary programs during the 1980s. As shown in Figure 1, not until 1992-93 does \"all other\" federal aid, excluding Medicaid, TANF/AFDC grants, and Food Stamps, return to the real-dollar level available to the state in 1979- 80. Reflecting recent domestic initiatives, the growth rate for this federal aid category has begun to increase, in spite of federal budget-balancing efforts. In 2005-2006, \"all other\" federal aid, excluding Food Stamps, Medicaid, and TANF/AFDC, shows a constant dollar increase compared with the year before. This is because of an increase in federal highway funding and military capital outlay. Other federal aid programs generally are not growing. Over the 26-year period, Medicaid, the major federal entitlement program in the state budget, has had real growth well above the rate of inflation. Although total federal aid has increased in constant dollars by 208.8 percent from 1979-80 to 2005-2006, the 768.4 percent real growth in the Medicaid program is accompanied by real growth of only 100.8 percent in federal aid for all other state programs, excluding Food Stamps and TANF/AFDC. A constant dollar increase of 52.5 percent in federal aid for the Food Stamps program since 1979-80 is related to Tennessee's recent increased caseload. The TANF/AFDC grants had a constant dollar decrease of 14.9 percent. Over the 26- year period, as shown in Table 1, real growth for all federal aid to state programs has averaged 4.4 percent per year. This growth above the rate of inflation has been led by the 8.7 percent annual-average real growth in the Medicaid program. TANF/AFDC decreased by 0.6 percent, while Food Stamps increased by 1.6 percent and all other federal aid increased by 2.7 percent on an annual-average basis. Over the last 17 years of the period, from 1988-89 through 2005-2006, real growth in total federal aid has increased above the longer-term growth rates. Total federal aid to state programs has grown at a 17-year annual-average rate of 6.6 percent. Real growth in this period has averaged 8.7 percent per year for Medicaid and 4.0 percent per year in Food Stamps, while TANF/AFDC decreased by 0.7%. All other federal aid has grown at a real-dollar rate of 5.6 percent per year. The 2005-2006 decline in the Medicaid match rate will result in increased state costs for federal mandates (Figure 2). Medicaid accounts for 81 percent of the $379.8 million state mandate cost in the 2005-2006 Table 1 Comparison of Federal Aid in State Budget, Actual 1979-80 through Estimated 2005-2006 In Millions of Constant (2005-2006) Dollars Increase Annual Existing Federal Mandates State Cost Since FY 1987 050100150200250300350400 87 88 89 90 9192 93 949596 97 98990001 02 03 04 05 06(Millions )fiscal year. The longer-term federal funding for mandated Medicaid expansions is accompanied by significant state costs, which are identified in detail below. While federal aid as a percentage of discretionary program funding has declined in the state budget since 1979-80, federal legislation in the late 1980s, early 1990s, and early 2000s has imposed increasingly costly mandates on state government. By fiscal year 2005-2006, provisions imposed since 1986-87 will cost $379.8 million per year in recurring state appropriations from General Fund tax sources. The cumulative state cost in 2003- 2004 was $305.4 million and in 2004-2005 is $287.6 million. Figure 2 illustrates the annual recurring state cost, from General Fund tax sources, of new federal mandates beginning in fiscal year 1986-87. Costly major Medicaid mandates imposed since 1986-87 (Figure 3) are expanded services under the 1988 catastrophic health care law; coverage of children aged one through 18 under 1989 and 1990 laws; payment of premiums and deductibles for poor Medicare clients under a 1990 law; Medicare premium increases beginning in 2002-2003; Medicare cost sharing affecting the state in 2005-2006; increase in the minimum wage for the nursing home program under a 1989 law; increases in the state Medicaid match rate as personal income increases; expansion of Medicaid eligibility unde r the 1988 federal welfare reform law; drug purchasing reform under a 1990 law; and the loss of federal funds matching institute for the mentally diseased (IMD) expenditures for acute inpatient stays for persons aged 21 to 64. Other Medicaid mandates include the 1988 nursing home reform initiative and the expansion of the child disability standard under the 1990 \"Zebley\" court ruling on supplemental security income regulations. Major federal mandates imposed in other programs since fiscal year 1986-87 (Figure 4) include expansion of AFDC eligibility and support services under the 1988 federal welfare reform law; exemption from the sales tax of food stamps and supplemental foods for women, infants, and children; increases in the state match rate for the former AFDC program; intervention services for handicapped infants and toddlers in the K-12 education system; extensions of federal social security and Medicare payroll taxes under the 1990 federal budget act; national standards under the commercial drivers license law; and other items of lesser fiscal impact affecting several state agencies. For purposes of this analysis, the term \"federal mandates\" is limited to provisions of federal law or regulation which require state government implementation, without option to the state. This includes mandatory new programs, changes in existing federal programs, and increases in state financial participation in jointly funded federal programs resulting from decreases in federal match rates.

A-70 State of Tennessee State Tax Revenues Introduction Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2005-2006 The revenues necessary to finance state government are collected from a variety of sources. The primary source of funding for state expenditures is appropriation from general revenues. General revenues are proceeds from taxes, licenses, fees, fines, forfeitures, and other imposts laid specifically by law. The revenue estimating process generally starts twelve months before a fiscal year begins. Revenue collections are tracked on a monthly basis, and this information, along with specific long-run forecasts of individual sectors of the economy, is used to form the basis for the next fiscal year's estimated revenue collections. Preliminary estimates are supplied to the Department of Finance and Administration in mid-summer by the Department of Revenue and the University of Tennessee Center for Business and Economic Research. Tax estimates are recalculated in October a nd November and refined in December and January for inclusion in the Governor's Budget Document. Sales tax estimates are based on estimated retail sales activity, which is provided by the Center for Business and Economic Research. Corporate excise tax estimates are made as late as possible in the year to take advantage of the latest available corporate profit forecasts for the nation and the October state tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue, which provide information useful in projecting quarterly estimated corporate tax payments through the next year. Estimates for selective excise taxes are commonly based on long-run consumption trends for the selectively-taxed items: cigarettes, gasoline, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Long-run trend analysis is also used as a basis for projecting corporate excise and franchise tax collections and Tennessee Valley Authority in lieu of tax payments. Motor vehicle fuel (primarily diesel fuel) taxes and motor vehicle registration fees are estimated conservatively, given their sensitivity to business cycles (especially the truck-related components of both taxes). The revenue estimating process in Tennessee incorporates the \"Good Practices in Revenue Estimating\" endorsed by the National Association of State Budget Officers and the Federation of Tax Administrators. This requires using national and state economic forecasts, developing an official revenue estimate, monitoring and monthly reporting on revenue coll ections, and revising estimates when appropriate. Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9-4-5104, 5105, 5106, and 5202 specify the manner in which tax revenue estimates are prepared and transmitted to the General Assembly in the Budget Document. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration prepares revenue estimates based on advice from economists, his own staff, the Department of Revenue, and the State Funding Board. The Funding Board, which is comprised of the Governor, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Comptroller, the State Treasurer, and the Secretary of State, is assisted in preparing its range of revenue growth estimates by economists from the state's universities, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff of the Department of Finance and Administration, Department of Revenue, and the Treasurer's Office. The Funding Board prepares and recommends a range of revenue growth estimates using the information provided by the economists, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff. The Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The growth estimates provide a basis for the tax revenue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, recommendation of revenue estimates in the Budget is the responsibility of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration. The State Funding Board's most recent letter notifying the Governor and the chairmen of the Senate and House Finance, Ways and Means committees of its revenue growth estimates is included at the end of the \"State Tax Revenues\" section in a subsection entitled \"State Funding Board, Range of Tax Revenue Estimates.\" This letter states the economic assumptions affecting the Funding Board's recommendations. A more detailed economic overview is presented in the \"Budget Overview\" section of the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the Budget Document immediately follow this introduction in a chart entitled \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues.\" These taxes include not only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes), but also those collected and deposited to the General Fund by some other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out their programs. In the revenue estimate charts, the latter are shown by collecting agency and are subtotaled as \"other state revenue.\" Following the chart comparing taxes for the three fiscal years, three charts are included to show the collections distributed by fund. The funds on the distribution charts, for Budget Document presentation, are General Fund, Education (Trust) Fund, Highway (Transportation) Fund, Debt Service Fund, and Cities and Counties (Local Government Fund). The distribution of taxes among the funds on these charts is as provided by current law. (For information about the inclusion of certain Special Revenue Fund taxes and fees in the General Fund estimates, see in Volume 2 of the Budget Document, in the \"Supplementary Information\" section, an article entitled \"Basis of Budgeting and Accounting.\") Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues of regulatory boards, with the collections and estimates listed by board. This is a supporting schedule to the \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues\" charts, on which single lines for regulatory board fees appear. In addition to the general revenues detailed in this section, other revenues are collected by departments, institutions, and agencies and are appropriated directly to them. These are called departmental revenues. In the Budget Document, these departmental revenues are estimated by program and are shown as federal revenue, other revenue (or, sometimes, current services and other revenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"other revenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue, current services revenue, non-governmental revenue, and revenue from cities and counties. These various departmental revenues consist of earnings and charges for goods and services; student tuition and fees in the higher education system; and donations, contributions, and grants-in-aid from the federal government, political subdivisions, foundations , corporations, and individuals. In a few cases, the other departmental revenues also include reserves from revolving funds or from the unencumbered balance and capital outlay (major maintenance) reserves, in instances in which specific legal authority to carry such funds forward exists. The departmental revenues are reflected in each department's budget as operating revenue. Following the tax estimate charts is a subsection detailing so-ca lled tax expenditures, which reports on major tax exemptions provided by law. After the tax expenditures charts, a subsection entitled \"Revenue Sources and Basis of Apportionment\" outlines the general tax revenues by collecting agency, along with TCA citations on the rate and source of the revenue and the basis of apportionment among funds and agencies, based on current law.

This section of the Budget Document is intended to fulfill that statutory obligation. Under the law, the tax expenditure report is required to \"...identify all exemptions, to the extent that it is practical, and estimate the amount of revenue which would have been collected by the state in the fiscal year commencing on July 1 next succeeding such report had each exemption not existed.\" The report on vendor compensation is required to show the amount paid to vendors for the collection of the sales tax. No format or reporting period is specified. Both reports are to be made no later than February 1 of each year. Vendors compensation for collection of the sales tax was repealed, effective July 1, 2000, by Public Acts of 2000, chapter 983. Thus, no report is made on vendors compensation. Tax Exemptions It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of non-profit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramatically. Such institutions are allowed to buy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individua l retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1-A and 1-B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for FY 2005-2006. Table 1-A presents revenue foregone on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1-B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this table, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double-counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Secondly, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change in a particular tax provision on taxpayer behavior which impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects).

State Funding Board Range of Tax Revenue Estimates Memorandum December 15, 2004 Page 2 of 5 revenue forecasts supplied by various economis ts as well as persons acquainted with the Tennessee revenue system. Since this is a revenue estimation process and not a budgeting process, the Board does not take into consideration the State's fiscal situation when developing its consensus ranges of revenue growth. Fiscal c onsiderations properly belong with those who set the State's reve nue estimates - the Administration that recommends appropriation levels based upon its assessment of revenue growth and the General Assembly that adopts a de facto revenue estimate through its final action on the appropriations bill. The consensus is that the economy has grown, but problems remain. Consumer confidence is shaky, due in part to the contin ued war in Iraq. Car sales have slowed. Presenters pointed to the lack of car manufacturer incentives, the increase in interest rates, and the increase in the pr ice of gas. Housing starts have declined. The demand for construction (materials and labor) needed in th e wake of the recent hurricanes has driven up the cost throughout the southeast. Furthe rmore, many households are experiencing dissavings. The presenters were uncertain as to the impact on the State's sales tax collections resulting from the federal tax law change allo wing for deductibility of state sales tax on federal income tax returns. Additionally, it was noted that the State traditionally has experienced several years of strong revenue growth after a sales tax rate increase. However, the most recent sales tax rate increase produced only one year of strong growth. Reference was also made to the im pact on sales tax revenues of \"e-tailing\" or \"retail purchases via the Internet.\" In terms of state revenue forecasts, all presenters believed the state would experience modest revenue growth duri ng both fiscal years 2004-05 and 2005-06. For fiscal year 2004-05, estimates from four of th e five presenters for total revenue growth range from 2.87% to 3.68%; the fifth estimat e of 2.1% is not incl uded due to certain assumptions embedded in the economic forecasting model that was used. For fiscal year 2005-06, the estimates for total revenue growth range from 3.21% to 3.99%. Based on the testimony received and the Board discussions, the Board developed the following consensus estimates expressed in ranges of growth rates in State tax revenue collections. The following table summarizes these estimates: FY 2004-05 FY 2005-06 4.0% General Fund Only 2.7% 3.2% 3.65% 4.4% The Board believes these consensus revenue growth ranges to be reasonable and appropriate for use in state budgeting. Alt hough the ranges for fiscal year 2004-05 have Memorandum December 15, 2004 Page 3 of 5 been lowered from those we presented in April 2004, we believe the budgeted numbers will be achieved due to the higher beginning base resulting from overcollection of revenues in the prior fiscal year. As in pa st years, the Board in tends to revisit these estimates prior to the General Assembly's fi nal budget deliberations. Each of you will be advised of any revisions made by the Board at that time. Additionally, the State Funding Board r eceived presentations regarding the Tennessee Education Lottery. The estimates pr ovided by the presenters are summarized in an attachment to this memorandum. Legislation in 2003 created the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation (TELC) (Tenne ssee Code Annotated Annotated Section 4-51- 111(c) requires the Board to establish a projected revenue range for the \"net lottery proceeds\" [defined in Section 4-51-102(14)] for the remainder of the current fiscal year and for the succeeding fiscal year. Mr. White, Executive Director, and Mr. Robert Currey, Fi scal Analyst, with the Fiscal Review Committee (FRC) presented the Board the FRC' s projections. Mr. Currey reviewed the history and past performance of the Tennessee Education Lottery. Ticket sales began in late January, 2004. The lottery started with f our instant ticket games; currently there are about 40 instant ticket games and three on-li ne games [Cash 3, Powerball, and Lotto 5 (which started in September 2004)]. Mr. Cu rrey reviewed the revenue generation history of the instant ticket games and each of the th ree on-line games. He noted the particular volatility of the Powerball revenue. He disc ussed other forecasti ng limitations, including the limited amount of actual Tennessee data , game dynamics, competition (from within and without the State), and the volatile matura tion process of a lotter y. In developing its estimates, the FRC excluded the data from the initial weeks after implementation of games for development of the fiscal year 2004- 05 estimates. For fiscal year 2005-06, the FRC used fiscal year 2004-05 estimates as th e base year, projected a 4% sales growth rate, a 1% population growth ra te, and held expenses as a pe rcent of revenue constant. The weighted average estimate of net lotter y proceeds available for deposit into the Education Account for fiscal year 2004-05 is $221,600,000 and for fiscal year 2005-06 is $232,800,000. Both amounts are 31% of lottery proceeds. Mr. White cautioned that revenues that become available for pre-sc hool and after-school programs should not be considered a recurring revenue source at a certain level and expend itures of these funds should be for non-recurring items. The Board additionally heard from Ms. Rebecca Paul, the Chief Executive Officer and President, Mr. Steve Adams, the Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Andy Davis, Chief Financial and Technology Officer of the TELC . The first deposit to the Education Account was made April 15, 2004 in the amount of $63,774,000; additional quarterly payments were made July 15 of $59, 497,000 and on October 15 of $51,314,000. As of October 31, 2004, an additional $19,986,000 had accrued toward the January 15, 2005 payment. There are currently approximat ely 4,500 retailers, up from the initial 3,500. This number is expected to grow to about 6,000 by the seventh year of the lottery. The time period for presentation of winning tickets was amended by the legislature in 2004; the TELC is estimating that approximately 2% of prizes (excluding j ackpot prizes) as the Memorandum December 15, 2004 Page 4 of 5 estimated amount for unclaimed prizes; 50% of which is to be deposited into the \"after school programs special account\" at the end of each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 2004-05. Actual ticket sale revenue through Oct ober 31, 2004 for fiscal year 2004-05 was $251,335,000. The TELC also forecasts a 4% increas e in sales. The TELC's estimate of net lottery proceeds available for deposit into the Education Account for fiscal year 2004- 05 is $210,035,000 and for fiscal year 2005-06 is $218,980,000. These amounts are 30.3% and 30.4% respectively of lottery proceeds. The Board then heard from Dr. Rich Rhoda, Executive Director, and Mr. Erik Ness, Associate Director for Policy, Pla nning and Research, of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, who presented an estima te of the total cost of lottery related student financial assistance for fiscal year 2005-06. Based on the actual fall 2004 lottery scholarship awards, they project an a nnual cost of approximately $140,000,000. This amount is not anticipated to increase substant ially until the fiscal year 2006-07, with an increase to $180,000,000, reflecting an anticipated 3% growth in the number of incoming freshmen and a mature program (freshman through senior scholarship recipients). During these discussions, the Board comp ared the various estimates provided and considered the offered explanations for the di fferences in estimates. For fiscal year 2004- 05, the estimates of net lottery proceeds differ by less than 5% ($11.5 million) due primarily to two factors. Fi rst, the estimates of Powerba ll gross ticket sales account for 75% of the ticket sale revenue estimate difference ($16.5 million of the $21.9 million dollar ticket sale revenue difference). Th e higher estimate provided by the FRC assumes an additional Powerball jackpot exceeding $150 million will occur during the remainder of the fiscal year while the TELC estimate assumed no further jackpots of this size occurring. The existence of such a jackpot can act to substantia lly increase sales of Powerball tickets. Both estimators agreed that should an additional jackpot exceeding $150 million occur, the higher FRC estimate would be met, but that if the higher jackpot did not materialize, then the FRC estimate w ould not be met. The Board also discussed the impact of \"jackpot fatigue\", particular ly as it relates to Powerball ticket sales. \"Jackpot fatigue\" refers to a phenomenon wher e players that were once eager to spend money on the lottery lose interest, partially due to boredom from jackpots that seem less impressive over time. For example, a payout of $50 million, once considered substantial, may no longer be sufficient to generate ex citement and increased sales. It is unknown what impact, if any, jackpot fatigue may have on ticket sales in Tennessee. Second, the estimates differ in the expense assumption assumed. This factor accounts for approximately $5 million of the $11.5 million diffe rence in net lottery proceeds estimates for fiscal year 2004-05. The FRC estimate is based on the expens e experience over the first 10 months of operations while the TELC estimate is based on expectations of prize payouts, game mixes, and other operating e xpenses during the forecast period. Applying the TELC expense ratio to the FRC lottery procee ds estimate results in an estimate of net Memorandum December 15, 2004 Page 5 of 5 lottery proceeds that is within $6.6 mill ion of TELC's estimate, a difference of approximately 3%. For fiscal year 2005-06, the difference in th e estimates of net lottery proceeds is approximately 6% ($13.7 million). The diffe rence is largely explained by Powerball sales estimates built into the base estimates and the expense assumptions used. The FRC estimate assumes an increase in all ticket sales of 5% (4% sales growth and 1% population growth) applied against their fiscal year 2004-05 estimates. The TELC estimate assumes varying levels of growth dependent on the type of game, with an average growth rate of approximately 4%. The differences in the underlying fiscal year 2004-05 Powerball sales estimates are magnifi ed in fiscal year 2005-06 and represent 2/3rds of the gross ticket sa les difference between the estimates. Like the prior year, the fiscal year 2005-06 estimates differ in the expense assumption used, with the FRC using the actual ratio from the first 10 months of operation and the TELC using a more detailed forecast. Applying the TELC expense assumption to the FRC estimate results in estimates of net lottery proceeds for fiscal year 2005-06 that are within 4%, or $9.3 million. The Board concluded that the estimates of net lottery proceeds, after adjustment for the expense assumption, are extremely close for both years but for assumptions regarding the frequency of occurrence of Powerball jackpots exceeding $150 million. Given the volatility of lottery sales contrasted with the recurring nature of scholarships, the Board consensus was that estimates should be conservative in nature until such time that more experience is gained in Tennessee. Consensus was reached on the following estimates of the net proceeds of lottery revenues to be deposited in the Lottery for E ducation Account, to be used for the various statutory purposes: FY 2004-05 FY 2005-06 Net Lottery Proceeds $210,000,000 $219,000,000 The estimates of the net lottery proceeds will be revisited at the time the State Funding Board considers revisions to the ranges of State revenue estimates prior to the adoption of the State's Appropriations Act. As indicated previously, each of you will be advised of any revisions made by the Board at that time. Each of us stands ready to discu ss this further at your convenience. Attachments cc.

It was created by the 45th General Assembly through passage of Public Chapter 126, Public Acts of 1887, codified as Title 9, Chapter 9, Section 101 of the Tennessee Code. By statute, the state's full faith and credit, as well as specific tax revenues are pledged for the payment of principal and interest on state bonds. Additionally, the law covenants that such pledged revenues shall not be less than 150 percent of the amount necessary to service the state's outstanding debt and any debt proposed to be issued. Adequate safeguards are therefore embodied in law against the issuance of excessive debt, and the state's current and future debt service requirements are well below the established legal limits. Over the years, Tennessee has consistently maintained a relatively low debt burden. This has been accomplished through the use of sound, prudent, and conservative debt management practices adopted by the executive and legislative branches of government, with concurrence of the State Funding Board. Such practices include funding a portion of the state's capital program with surplus cash, cancellation of bond authorizations in lieu of issuing debt, creating and maintaining a \"Rainy Day Fund\" to offset unanticipated revenue shor tfalls, and the adoption of state statutes to control the issuance of excessive debt. This consistent and conservative approach to the management of our debt had previously earned the state AAA bond ratings from the nation's leading credit rating agencies. However, due to our inability to solve the structural deficit that exists in the state's tax system, and the continuing use of non-recurring funds to fund recurring expenses caused the rating agencies to downgrade the state's bond ratings in 2001 and issue the state a negative credit outlook. Citing a \"turnaround in the state's financial operations\", the rating agencies revised their outlook from negative to stable in 2004. Thecurrent ratings on the state's general obligation long-term debt are: Fitch AA, Standard and Poor's AA, and Moody's Investor Service Aa2. The state continues to enjoy a low debt burden, and access to the capital markets remains strong. However, the end result of lower credit ratings will be higher interest rates and increased debt service expense as the state issues future debt in order to fund its capital needs. During the 2003-2004 fiscal year, the state sold $174 million in general obligation bonds. No general obligation bond sales are anticipated prior to the close of this fiscal period. As of June 30, 2004, Tennessee's total general obligation bonded indebtedness was $1,000,151,000 excluding the Facilities Revolving Fund. This debt was issued entirely for institutional and building construction. The second session of the 103rd General Assembly approved new authorizations in the amount of $513,880,000. Of this amount, institutional and building bonds accounted for $334,880,000, and highway bonds $159,000,000. The practice of using the state's cash flow to finance road projects in lieu of issuing debt has been one of the key fact ors in Tennessee's ability to secure and retain very high bond ratings. Consistent with this long-standing policy, the Funding Board, cancelled $74.0 million in highway bond authorizations and $3.2 million in institutional and buildin g construction bonds in the first six months of this fiscal period. The increase in bond authorization coupled with the Funding Board's action on bond cancellations reduced the category of authorized but unissued bonds to $1,493,749,000, which includes $726,500,000 in highway authorizations, $584,418,000 in capital construction bonds, and $112,231,000 in Facility Revolving Fund bonds. The 2005-2006 proposed budget recommends the authorization of an additional $156.0 million in highway construction bonds, $185.8 million in institutio nal and building bonds, and $16.5 million in Facility Revolving Fund Bonds.

A-108 State of Tennessee Capital Budget Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2005 - 2006 The Capital Budget process begins with the receipt of departmental and agency capital main-tenance and project requests. The various agen-cies and departments annually submit their capi-tal requests in priority order to the Department of Finance and Administration, Division of Budget. Upon receipt of the capital budget requests, three phases of review are undertaken by the Di-vision of Capital Projects and Real Property Management and the Division of Budget. The initial phase allows for an understanding of the need by the Capital Projects and Real Property Management and Budget review teams. Phase two is built upon the technical requirements of the capital request, involving on-site visits by the review teams. The final phase involves financial review. The projects are analyzed for funding requirements and consistency with program goals and are reviewed within projected avail-ability of funds in the budget for the requested fiscal year. If funds are deemed to be insuffi-cient, individual projects may be deferred to be included in future budgets or rejected. The Administration intends for the needs of departmental programs to be the impetus for all capital outlay requirements. Facilities funded through the capital budget process should sup-port program and service requirements. There-fore, funding of projects is analyzed on priority of fiscal support for individual existing and new programs. The goal is to find the best mix of new capital outlay and facility maintenance in order to sustain and implement programs and services. The management of facilities should be flexible enough to adjust to changing programs through renovation of existing assets. Attempts are made to minimize operational costs and fu-ture capital expenditures through better design and more flexible layouts, as has been done in the state's new prisons. In the event that a capi-tal project creates the need for additional opera-tional funding, the operating costs are identified during the capital budget review and further re-viewed in the development of the budget in the year when the new space is expected to be occu- pied. Improvements to real property funded by public or private funds must be approved by the State Building Commission, comprised of seven ex-officio members: the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Treasurer, and the Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. The State Build-ing Commission, in addition to supervising im-provements to real property, oversees leases by state agencies and the demolition of structures located on state property. The capital items presented in this document as recommendations to the General Assembly consist of projects meeting the requirements and policy guidelines of the State Building Commis-sion. The capital project recommendations are itemized by department. Capital maintenance projects are defined as major, non-routine repairs and replacements un-related to new constr uction and costing $100,000 or more. Maintenance projects costing less than this amount are addressed within the depart-ments' operational budget major maintenance programs. Capital maintenance projects include items that appreciably extend the life of the fa-cility, such as alterations to rectify code defi-ciencies, modifications to improve utility sys-tems, repaving, roof repair s, exterior fencing and lighting, and repair projects that restore a facility to its former condition and do not result in changes in facility use. Funding for these pro-jects is included in the amount allocated to the Department of Finance and Administration, and projects are selected for completion according to the review process outlined above. Capital outlay projects are defined as those providing new facilities or materially extendingCapital Budget the useful life and improving or changing the function of an existing facility. These projects include facility renovation, new construction, new utility or service systems, land with or with-out buildings, appurtenances, site improvements or permanent betterments, and initial equipment to furnish and operate a new or improved facility which require the assistance of a design profes-sional or cost $100,000 or more. For fiscal year 2005-2006, the capital outlay budget proposal recommends a total of $301,300,000, divided between capital outlay projects and capital maintenance requests. Capital Maintenance \u2014 Capital maintenance projects are recommended at a level of $97,195,000. A State bond authorization of $42,653,000 and state appropriations of $35,492,000 are requested. Federal and other sources equal the remainder of the total amount. These projects focus on maintaining current fa-cilities, primarily through repair and renovation of roofing, mechanical, and electrical systems. Funding is also included to bring state facilities in line with federal standards for underground storage tanks, asbestos, and citizens with dis-abilities. The Tennessee Board of Regents and the University of Tennessee are also funded for modifications to assist in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Capital Outlay Projects \u2014 Capital outlay pro- jects recommended for this fiscal year total $204,105,000. Of this total, $143,147,000 in bonds and $16,408,000 in state appropriations are requested. Federal and other sources equal the remainder of the total amount. Projects from dedicated sources of revenue are also recommended for the Department of Transportation and the Tennessee Wildlife Re-sources Agency. Facilities Revolving Fund \u2014 Capital projects and maintenance for the Facilities Revolving Fund is recommended at a funding level of $25,155,000. Facilities Revolving Fund capital projects are listed in the Facilities Revolving Fund section, which follows the Capital Projects section of this document. Operating Costs \u2014 Included within this section is an estimate of the first year operating costs resulting from proposed new construction. Dif-ferences in operating costs can be the result of efficiencies from better designs and energy sys-tems or program requirements. Renovation pro-jects, which do not have an impact on operating efficiencies, are considered to be cost neutral. Only those projects which will have increases or decreases in operating costs from the current budget are included in the schedule. New Bond Authorizations \u2014 Capital mainte- nance, capital outlay, and Facilities Revolving Fund requests will require new bond authoriza-tions totaling $202,300,000. The chart below compares the bond authorizations recommended with those approved by the General Assembly during the past several years.

2006 The Facilities Revolving Fund (FRF) was established in 1988 to provide efficient management of the state office and warehousing facilities. State agencies are charged a fair market rate for the space they occupy. These revenues, along with any necessary current services revenue and reserve funds constitute the operating funds for FRF. The fund pays for facilities management costs of state-owned and leased office and warehouse space. These costs include debt service on buildings financed with bonds, routine and major maintenance, relocation expenses and furniture for state agencies, and payments for leased office space not owned by the state but occupied by state agencies. While FRF is administered by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, daily operations of the fund are jointly managed by the Department of General Services and the Department of Finance and Administration. General Services operates, maintains, and manages FRF facilities. Finance and Administration constructs and renovates facilities through its Division of Capital Projects and Real Property Management, with approval of the State Building Commission. The division also assigns space to agencies, handles lease acquisitions, and provides relocation services and furniture to agencies. The Department of General Services maintains the daily upkeep of FRF facilities through Operational Maintenance. Items such as contr acts for janitorial and security services are funded through this allotment.

A-127 State of Tennessee State Taxpayers Budget The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" section is included to distinguish between state appropriations from general state taxes and appropriations from dedicated taxes and fees, which are narrowly levied and earmarked for specific purposes. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" excludes the dedicated funds; it reports only appropriations from general state tax sources, along with estimates of the general taxes. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" excludes appropriations from dedicated tax and fee sources, all federal revenues, and all other departmental revenues. This section begins with a departmental summary of state appropriations from general tax sources. The chart entitled \"Tennessee Taxpayer Budget, Departmental Summary of State Appropriations,\" includes this departmental summary information and a grand total for the State Taxpayers Budget appropriations. The chart then shows a single line-item for appropriations from dedicated state tax sources and a grand total state appropriation for the Budget Document, which reconciles to the total state appropriations in the remainder of the Budget Document. Following the departmental summary of state appropriations is a summary of appropriations from dedicated taxes and fees. This schedule summarizes the various departmental appropriations from dedicated state sources that are excluded from the State Taxpayers Budget. Examples of appropriations from dedicated state sources are the appropriations to the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) from hunting and fishing license fees and from real estate transfer taxes supporting the Wetlands Acquisition Fund, administered by TWRA, and appropriations to regulatory agencies from fees imposed on health professions, other professions, banks, and environment-impacting industries. The third schedule in this section is a more detailed breakdown of the state appropriations from general tax sources. \"State Taxpayers Budget, State Appropriations by Program,\" itemizes these appropriations by program. As with the departmental summary, this schedule includes a single line item for appropriations from dedicated sources to balance to the total state appropriations elsewhere in the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the State Taxpayers Budget follow the appropriations by program. The chart entitled \"State Taxpayers Budget, Comparison Statement of State Revenues,\" includes taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes) as well as those collected and deposited to the General Fund by other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out their programs. This chart excludes taxes and fees collected and deposited in the General Fund which are earmarked or dedicated for specific use.

Implementation of the agreement will result in final resolution of the lawsuit that was filed in 1968. The settlement agreement is designed to \"create an educational system that enhances increased enrollment of African American students at the predominately white institutions and that likewise enhances the enrollment of white students at the state's predominat ely black institution,\" which is Tennessee State University (TSU) in Nashville. The agreement also is intended \"to increase the presence of other -race faculty, staff, and administrators on the campuses of the state's colleges and universities.\" Except for one 10 -year funding commitment, the plan is to be implemented over five years from January 4, 2001. The agreement sets forth commitments for higher education in middle Tennessee, statewide issues in both university systems, and implementation. Major ingredients of the plan require annual appropriations for a TSU Endowment for Educational Excellence over 10 years; capital improvements and revitalization of the TSU Avon Williams Downtown Campus; consideration of merger of the Nashville School of Law wit h TSU, which has been ruled out; creation of new, high -demand academic programs at TSU as an alternative to the law school merger; statewide recruitment and retention initiatives for African American students, faculty, and administrators, including scholar ships, pre -doctoral fellowships, visiting professorships, pre -university summer programs, and minority financial aid; and recruitment of other -race and non -traditional students to TSU. The first appropriation for the state's commitment to this settlement agreement was made in the 2001 General Appropriations Act, and administrative initiatives began in the last half of fiscal year 2000 -2001. Major program initiative spending began in fiscal year 2001 -2002 and continues in the current year and next year. 332.13 Geier Desegregation Settlement Full-Time 0 0 0 0 0 Part-Time 0 0 0 0 0 Seasonal 0 0 0 0 0 Total 0 0 0 0 0 Higher Education B-94 Actual 2003 -2004 Estimated 2004 -2005 Base 2005 -2006 Improvement 2005 -2006 Recommended 2005 -2006 Payroll 0 0 0 0 0 11,265,000 Federal 0 0 0 0 0 Other 0 0 0 0 0 Total State -Administered Programs Full-Time 99 101 101 0 101 Part-Time 2 3 3 0 3 Seasonal 0 0 0 0 0 Total 101 104 104 0 104 Payroll 3,964,600 5,284,900 5,230,200 Higher Education B-95 University of Tennessee System The University of Tennessee (UT) is a statewide land grant institution governed by a Board of Trustees.

Judicial power is vested in the various levels of courts that compose the state's court system. The co urt system can be grouped into the following functional areas: The Supreme Court Intermediate Appellate Courts Trial Courts Courts of limited jurisdiction Court services and support. The Supreme Court is composed of five justices; each is elected to an eight-year term. The workload of the court consists of cases appealed from lower courts. Cases may be further appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court only on grounds of federal constitutionality. Supreme Court decisions act to resolve controversies arising ou t of Tennessee law and to establish guidelines for the lower courts to use in future decisions. The Intermediate Appellate Courts are composed of the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Court of Appeals hears appeals only in civil cas es from the lower courts. The Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction to hear most felony and misdemeanor appeals from general trial courts as well as post -conviction petitions. The state's trial courts include Chancery, Criminal, Circuit and Probate Courts. Chancery Courts are the traditional equity courts used when common law and/or statutory law proves in adequate for cases. Circuit Courts, which sometime overlap with the Chancery Courts, have jurisdiction to hear civil and criminal cases. Crimin al Courts have jurisdiction over criminal cases and hearing misdemeanor appeals from lower courts. Probate Courts primarily have jurisdiction over probate of wills and administration of estates. Courts of limited jurisdiction are funded locally and inclu de General Sessions, Juvenile, and Municipal Courts. Jurisdiction of General Sessions Courts vary from county to county based on state laws and private acts; they hear civil, criminal, and juvenile cases, except in counties where the legislature has estab lished separate Juvenile Courts. Municipal Courts have jurisdiction in cases involving violations of city ordinances.
