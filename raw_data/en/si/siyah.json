Program Leadership Current Residents Our Culture Our residents participate in wellness activities in the community, team bonding at theme parks, mission trips to other countries and so much more. This is just a glimpse of all the fun our residents have. Curriculum Our curriculum is comprehensive, and offers a wide range of opportunities to tailor your education to your professional goals. When our residents complete their training, they are well-equipped to meet the needs of their patients in any practice situation. - Curriculum - Rotation Schedule Research As one of the key components in ACGME program requirements, research activity is an essential part of training. In the era of evidence-based medicine, we strongly believe at AdventHealth residents should develop critical thinking skills to evaluate the publications and apply new knowledge in their clinical practice. Our program has a well-developed infrastructure and fostering culture to support residents who are interested in pursuing basic research, clinical research, or quality improvement/patient safety projects. By promoting research and scholarly activities, our ultimate goal is to train the next generation of physicians with strengths in both clinical and academic medicine. Residents and faculty involved in required GME scholarly activities receive guidance from the Center for Academic Research Excellence (CARE) through the Clinical Academic Research team, comprised of an Academic Research Mentor, a Project Coordinator, and a Regulatory Coordinator. In addition, the center includes a group of biostatisticians, a health economist, and a medical editor. CARE assists residents and faculty with all types of scholarly activities (case studies, QI projects and research studies), from study design and protocol development, to data analysis and poster, presentation or manuscript preparation.
