BettiPosted a year ago on BookRetreats I wanted a spiritual space and to see some of the sites of Greece. I chose this retreat because I thought it looked interesting... found the teacher to be a bit cold. The yoga helped my back issues, but overall I didn't think it was relaxing. A nice retreat for hard-core yogis, but not much else to do in between yoga sessions. KikiPosted 3 years ago on BookRetreats This healing center is absolutely paradise!!! We have been so lucky beacause we stayed at the home of Anja and Costas for one week and we felt as we were born again!! Peacefully, with a very positive energy!! The view is unbelievable and the rooms are so beautifull!!! It was our first time that we experienced Detox and Yoga treatment!!! Anja and Costas are the best couple to make you feel happy!!
