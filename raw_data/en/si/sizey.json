The Barn Group has the possibility of becoming a hub of indoor/outdoor activity and diversity that anchors and brands the image of UCR through a respectful integration of old and new. The Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 will: Provide a unique dining and entertainment center. Enhance awareness of the Campus's agrarian heritage. Serve as a gateway / link between the East Campus and the West Campus. Integrate indoor and outdoor spaces to support dining and entertainment programs. Be developed as a model of sustainable adaptive reuse that can serve to both instruct and demonstrate principles of sustainability.METHODOLOGY The 2010 Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 DPP was realized through a series of four on-campus workshops which included the UCR Project Management Team, Steering Committee, and the design consultant team. This team included: the Offices of Capital and Physical Planning, Office of Design and Construction and Housing, Dining & Residential Services. The working sessions included detailed input from KUCR, as well as the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (CHASS), University Club, and other campus representatives. The preferred alternative was presented and favorably reviewed by the Campus Design Review Board (DRB). Previous campus planning documents were used as a point of departure. They include: 1993 Historical Resources Inventory, The Barn Theater and The Barn Group 2002 East Campus Infrastructure Detailed Project Program 2005 Long Range Development Plan 2006 East/Southeast Campus Area Study 2007 Campus Design Guidelines 2008 Campus Aggregate Master Planning Study (CAMPS) 2009 Barn Area Study 2010 Historic Resources Assessment--The Barn Group and University Cottage The 2010 Historical Resources Assessment did not encounter any \"historical resources\" as defined by CEQA within the project area. However, because the buildings are associated with the earliest history of the campus, the buildings should be given special consideration in planning and design. This could include keeping the building s together as a group and preserving their rustic feel by retaining features that contribute to their historic character. The program elements were defined and located based on campus and user requirements and standards, as well as design consultant input. PROJECT SITE The project is located in the southwest Carillon Mall District near the intersection of West Campus Drive with the Barn Walk and the western terminus of the Eucalyptus Walk. &'6#+.'&\u0002241,'%6\u0002241)4#/ /#;\u0002\u0014\u001a\u000e\u0002\u0014\u0012\u0013\u0012INTRODUCTION Executive SummaryPROJECT SCOPE : BARN PROJECT PHASES 1 & 2 & 3 The Barn Project will be developed in three phases. Phase 1 will include: the renovation of The Barn and construction of the Kitchen Addition; the relocation, renovation, and addition to the Barn Stable; the relocation and renovation of the Cottage; the East Courtyard; the Cottage South Patio; Loading Dock Area and Drive Aisle along West Campus Drive; and major utility connections. Phase 2 will include construction of the new facility for KUCR and the West Courtyard. This DPP addresses these two phases in detail. Phase 3 will include the Barn Theater Addition and Renovation. This DPP locates and provides design guidelines for the future development of the Barn Theater, but does not include detailed programming for this phase.

Enhance awareness of the Campus's agrarian heritage. Serve as a gateway / link between the East Campus and the West Campus. Integrate indoor and outdoor spaces to support dining and entertainment programs. Provide a well organized, welcoming, secure, and efcient group of buildings. Design the buildings to function as a group or independently. Achieve a minimum LEED Silver USGBC certication. Develop sustainable design as Project GoalsOVERVIEW A detailed analysis of the 2009 Barn Area Study (BAS) was completed at the start of the project. The purpose of the review was to obtain a common understanding of the site, and identify areas that needed further attention during the DPP. The site analysis diagram and supporting text illustrate the key issues to test and verify in the 2009 BAS site plan. FLOW & CIRCULATION The Barn Group, located northwest of the intersection of West Campus Drive and the termination of Eucalyptus Walk, is a gateway site from the community into the core of the East Campus.The Barn Walk links the perimeter to the core of the campus and provides an important service access to Sproul Hall. A strong pedestrian corridor enters The Barn Group site through the Humanities & Social Sciences Building, and connects to the Barn Walk from the west, while the walkway that runs along the south of Sproul and Watkins Hall connects to the Barn Walk from the east. This linkage must be maintained. West Campus Drive is a major peripheral Campus loop . Proposed realignment to the road is considered a future project (note: the illustration shows the future road realignment as proposed in the 2009 BAS). The project must be planned to work with both the current and the future road. Within the site, easy flow from indoor to outdoor should be enhanced to support dining and entertainment and to activate the outdoor spaces.OUTDOOR SPACES The project will make a signicant contribution to the existing and very successful outdoor spaces on the campus. Two major courtyards (East and West) furnish seating areas that support the Barn's primary activities. A third outdoor space at the termination of Eucalyptus Walk, the South Cottage Patio, could offer an inviting entry to the Barn Walk. IMPLEMENTATION Initial Phase 1 & 2 construction can be completed via a series of coordinated projects. Site planning will need to consider how the Barn Theater can be accessed for future development. AREAS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION Several areas of the BAS are worth revisiting. Using the Barn Stable for KUCR may not be the best programmatic t for the existing building. Adding a full basement under the Barn Stable may not be the most cost effective way to gain space. The location of the restrooms seems to isolate the Barn Annex program from the East Courtyard. The Cottage may need to move north to avoid existing underground utilities. Two outdoor performance stages could be combined into one, to improve Campus and site circulation and West Courtyard seating layout. HISTORIC CHARACTER\u2014DIMENSIONS AND PROPORTIONS The character of the existing barn structures should be maintained. Additions should support their character but be distinctly different, while being compatible with the re-purposed barn structures. The dimensions and proportions, as well as the materials and roof congurations, will need to be carefully studied in the design phases.

Maintaining the character of the existing structures to be repurposed and developing the synergy between the indoor and outdoor spaces for dining and entertainment were the touchstones for the development of the preferred concept. A series of diagrams present the preferred concept, and show how operational issues (including service access and security) are addressed. A study of potential improvements to the Sproul Hall loading dock was also done. II.

The site plan organizes the buildings and land to frame a series of outdoor rooms, while enhancing the pedestrian pathways throughout. The East Courtyard will provide for quiet outdoor dining and is framed by two historically signicant buildings; the relocated Cottage, a coffeehouse and entrance marker for the East Campus; and The Barn, a cultural dining and entertainment venue. The West Courtyard will host a variety of live performances as well as provide space for outdoor dining. It is framed by The Barn, the Barn Theater, and KUCR. The relocated Barn Stable frames a patio providing a more intimate indoor/outdoor venue for various events including faculty gathering and weddings. Service for the Kitchen Addition and KUCR is screened by the landscape strip along West Campus Drive.

This service access is separated from West Campus Drive by a landscaped median that will screen the facilities. Service access to The Barn will be from the Loading Dock at the southwest corner of the Kitchen Addition. This service lane also provides access to KUCR's three parking spaces. Service access to the Sproul Hall Loading Dock will be from a service road that parallels the Barn Walk. BICYCLES Bicyclists will move with trafc along West Campus Drive and connect to East Campus via the Barn Walk service road. PEDESTRIANS The Barn Walk links the perimeter to the core of the East Campus. It is the terminus of both Eucalyptus Walk and the walk just south of Sproul Hall and Watkins Hall. A strong pedestrian corridor enters the Barn Group through the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (CHASS) Building from the northeast, and connects to the Barn Walk. Should entertainment events close the West Courtyard to through trafc, pedestrians can walk through the orange grove just south of CHASS. West Campus Drive is a major peripheral campus loop road for pedestrians as well as vehicles.

One of the issues identied with the existing loading dock is the need for the front-loading trash collection vehicles to back up to West Campus Drive when exiting. While the costs for any work associated with the Sproul Hall Loading Dock (east of the curb at the Barn Walk) are not included in the budget of the Barn Project Phases 1 & 2, three options were explored for this report: Maintain the existing conguration. Recongure the service vehicle spaces and screen the recycling/ trash bins within a new enclosure (as illustrated in the Composite Site Organization Plan, page 13. Provide a new loading dock between the Sproul Hall buildings as well as the modications mentioned in option 2 above (as illustrated in the diagram on this page). Each option will need to allow for through access to the Carillon Mall by Fire The unique dining and entertainment opportunities offered by the facilities, and the site's rich agrarian and cultural heritage were emphasized throughout the planning process. The addition of KUCR to the site increases the breadth of entertainment possibilities, while giving the station a new and more functional facility. The identity and character of the project\u2014within the campus, within the Riverside community, and within the UC system\u2014are addressed in relation to the unique functional requirements that are the basis of the program. The Project Area Summary and the Room Data Sheets summarize these requirements. III.

Narratives that describe the systems that support the buildings are provided for civil, landscape, structural, food service, acoustical, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing. Sustainability has been fore-grounded and integrated with the discussions of building character, materials, and systems. The project will obtain at minimum a LEED Silver rating. Furthermore, the design phase should explore opportunities to demonstrate sustainable principles where possible. IV. SUPPORT DOCUMENTSOVERVIEW The Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 offers the opportunity to demonstrate that these well-used (and well-loved) existing structures have utility beyond being part of the historical record. Part found object, part new intervention, the project can be a model for sustainable adaptive reuse. This project should explore an unromantic attitude toward these structures, one that retains their integrity while addressing contemporary needs and sensibilities. To that end, the development should express what is new as new, and allow the spirit of the old to remain. The Barn Group is comprised of three existing historic barns (each to be renovated and added to), a historic cottage (to be relocated and renovated), and a new radio station. These buildings are to be interconnected through four signicant new outdoor rooms. In order to be perceived as a group of related structures and activities, it is very important that the material choices and massing strategies be thought of as a whole. To organize the various structures on the site, a coordinated hierarchy of building elements is proposed. PRIMARY ELEMENTS The three barns (called \"The Barn\", \"Barn Stable,\" and \"Barn Theater\") and the Cottage were part of the original Citrus Research Station that has become UCR. The Barn has a long history as an important performance venue on the campus. The overall character of this project is driven by a desire to revive and repurpose these four buildings as the central elements in this new dining and entertainment group.The goal is to update these existing structures in the spirit of their original design. The vernacular and material strategies employed in the existing structures will be the basis for material decisions. It is desirable to maintain the essential character of each structure as it is repurposed, and in several cases relocated. The buildings are to be treated as working farm structures that are being given a new life. The existing three barns are wood frame structures on concrete slabs with painted wood siding (predominantly board and batten and some horizontal wood siding) and the Cottage has painted horizontal wood siding. The addition to The Barn north of the existing stage would be the same type of construction as The Barn. These existing buildings are predominantly rectangular structures that vary in width and height, with overhangs on four sides. They have wood windows and doors and either asphalt shingle or corrugated metal roofs. In the renovation of these structures the exterior siding will be repaired and re-used as much as possible. New double-glazed wood windows, with true divided lights, will replace existing windows. New wood doors in various congurations will replace existing and there will be a few large sliding barn doors with glazing. Additional openings will be added to provide daylight to the spaces that are frequently occupied. The roofs will be replaced with either new asphalt shingles or standing seam metal. SECONDARY ELEMENTS Signicant additions are to be made to each barn, in some cases nearly equal in size to the original structures. These additions should be secondary and recessive in relation to the barns. They should be compatible with the barns, but distinct as additions. They should be developed as a \"family\" of additive elements, which relate to each other within the group. All should have the same siding material. To contrast with the barns, horizontal metal or wood siding is recommended. Doors and windows should be metal. In order to address the varying eave heights of the existing structures they will most likely have flat roofs, with a durable, light colored single-ply membrane. TERTIARY ELEMENTS There are a variety of elements that are needed to knit the project into the site, to meet the functional requirements of the hybrid program, and to address the uniqueness of the existing buildings. The most signicant of these is the Shade Structure in the West Courtyard. Also included are four trellises, fences, gates, restrooms, a mechanical / electrical support structure, a canopy over the kitchen service area, and the connecting elements between the existing barns and their additions. They too, should be developed as a family of elements. The shade structures should be a mixture of steel and wood, as should the fences and gates. The small buildings (restrooms and mechanical / electrical support structure) should be very recessive and closely woven in with the landscape elements. They should be \"planted-out\" with vine armatures on their walls over FRC or metal siding. Most are windowless, although skylights in System Narrativesmay be desirable. They should have low roofs, most likely flat, that could be planted if determined to be appropriate. THE NEW BUILDING \u2014KUCR As the only new building in the project, as the home of the vibrant KUCR, and as the rst purpose-built radio station in the UC system, this structure has several roles to play in The Barn Group. To some extent it should be a background building, a visual and acoustical buffer separating the West Courtyard from West Campus Drive and the freeway. The building should also promote the identity and presence of KUCR, as the station both makes and broadcasts radio from this site. The design should employ composite strategies, using the hierarchy of elements outlined above. The Outdoor Stage at the West Courtyard is part of the entertainment program for The Barn. The Outdoor Stage roof will be fairly high on its east side to allow for adequate sight lines. It should relate to the Primary Elements above--barn structures--in either form or structure (or both). To play down its size and accommodate a program that is rather inward looking (security and acoustical isolation are very important) the main part of the new building should relate to the Secondary Elements outlined above. In this case, however, a simple shed roof, lower toward the West Courtyard and higher toward the freeway, may make the most sense. Acoustical analysis will be needed to conrm that the massing is helping both to exclude freeway noise and to contain sound related to performances within the West Courtyard. Finally, the small ofce wing is conceived of as a flat roof tucking under the larger shed. It should relate to the Tertiary Elements outlined above. FLEXIBILITY / ADDRESSING CHANGE The programmed spaces allow for flexibility and many of the spaces could be adapted (if need be) over time. Whether tailored for the specic needs of performance, dining, or radio production, the buildings should be designed to respond to a variety of formal and informal activities that change over time. SUSTAINABLITY An integrated design approach will be needed to achieve sustainable design. Concentrating on \"rst principles\"--of orientation, shading, natural ventilation, and other passive strategies--will go a long way toward achieving sustainable design in this climate. Among the most important concepts are durability and consideration of the life cycle impact of these buildings. All materials need to be long-lasting and low maintenance. The goal of obtaining LEED Silver, as mandated by the University, should be easily met. Raising the bar higher, to LEED Gold, is possible, with little cost impact. Designing the buildings and landscape to reveal their sustainable systems and to educate their users about \"green\" principles should be a fundamental aspect of the design.BUILDING AND LANDSCAPE The Riverside campus has a number of very successful outdoor spaces. These are a key part of the campus character and identity. This project is committed to contributing to and extending the outdoor spaces on the campus. The potential for integration of indoor and outdoor spaces is deeply imbedded in the building program. In the development of the design, the building and landscape should be seen as inseparable partners, so that in the end the project has as much to say about successful outdoor spaces as it does about successful interiors. These outdoor spaces will be able to support a variety of activities. An effort has been made to program the outdoor spaces with as much specicity as the interior spaces. These spaces can work with the buildings to establish the character of The Barn Group and engage the natural cycles of the site with the theater of everyday life.ARCHITECTURAL Connection\" Diagram in Section II (Functional Concepts) GENERAL SITE WORK The majority of the site work for the Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 will be completed during Phase 1 of construction. Although nal landscape and hardscape treatments for certain areas may wait until Phase 2 construction is complete, underground utility work, grading, the majority of the drainage systems, and primary paving should be incorporated into the early Phase 1 construction activities. GENERAL UTILITY ISSUES Utility design and construction practices shall follow UC Riverside standards. Where UC Riverside standards do not exist, appropriate local, state, and federal regulations shall be followed. For utilities such as graywater and rainwater, where local codes may inhibit standard green building design practices, the University shall support the design team's use of codes from other municipalities within the State of California. Specic design related items include: Provide a minimum ve (5) foot separation between outside edge of building foundations and centerline of nearest underground utility line. Provide separate meters for each building to allow for effective commissioning and long-term use monitoring for gas, water, power, hot water, and electricity. WATER Domestic water will require new points of connection for the proposed buildings within The Barn Group. At this time the civil engineer assumes that there will be three new connection points as per the utility diagram. The existing 12\" water line running to the west of the Barn Stable conflicts with the proposed location for KUCR and will need to be relocated further to the west. The point of this relocation shall serve as one of the water points of connection (see utility diagram). A three valve cluster will be installed at each point of connection; one isolation valve on the service lateral, and two valves at each tee head. Each building will require the installation of a separate meter on this service lateral. Size of water service laterals will be provided by the MEP. Fire suppression water supply is combined in the same piped network as potable water. Location of a new re hydrant, if required, will be coordinated with the campus Fire Marshall. A water softener will need to be installed for the Kitchen Addition within The Barn Group. This should be located within the Kitchen Addition. SANITARY SEWER At least one new sanitary sewer point of connection will be required for The Barn Group. This connection will occur to the southwest of The Barn Group as per the utility diagram. At this new point of connection a sanitary sewer manhole will be constructed. During the conceptual design phase the civil engineer may evaluate the option of including an alternative point of connection for the Cottage and proposed outdoor Public Restroom at the East Courtyard (see utility diagram). Size of sewer service laterals will be provided by the MEP. A grease interceptor from the kitchen will be required. GRAYWATER There is no recycled water system on campus and as such alternative reclaimed water resources would have to be derived from onsite sources. The most viable water reuse source on site is the graywater generated within the Kitchen Addition. In order to tap this source, the Kitchen Addition will need to be dual plumbed so as to separate graywater from blackwater. Graywater is dened as wash water that typically comes from sinks, showers, and laundry facilities; while blackwater is dened as water that is exposed to organic material. Within the Kitchen Addition it is assumed that graywater would be generated through water sources that have minimal-to-no contact with organics. Sinks used to clean soiled items will be connected directly to the sanitary sewer. Kitchen sink layout and type of use will be provided by the Foodservice Consultant and MEP. Graywater collected from the Kitchen Addition should be treated through ltration and disinfection, and used immediately for toilet flushing or irrigation. Graywater shall not be stored longer than 24 hours prior to use. Graywater system design will follow the Uniform Plumbing Code. Construction of a graywater system is estimated cost between $25,000 and $40,000 (actual cost will depend on length of piping installed, ltration system specied, disinfection system specied, and type reuse). Given the relatively low cost of water in Riverside, this system is not expected to pay for itself within its design lifespan. This system would however provide an exceptional opportunity for demonstration by the university and help the project meet UC Riverside's sustainability goals. ELECTRICAL The electrical point of connection will occur at Vault 3A (see \"Utility Points of Connection\" diagram), allowing connection to the 12kV substation. This project will require that the existing transformer and 800 amp service be replaced with a new 480kVa transformer and 600 amp service that meets the project demands as per the MEP. The existing service will be replaced with new copper conduit for all new service connections. New electric meters shall be installed at each building. The existing transformer will need to be replaced in order to accommodate the 600 amp service; and may be pad-mounted as per UC Riverside standards. The conduit between MH 12 and MH 13 is currently out of use but should be reserved if possible for re- use with data/telecommunications. The line to the west of the current Barn Stable location (feed to CHASS) can be slurry capped and spanned with a bridge foundation in order to avoid moving the line. The old 800 amp service and transformer shall be retained by the University.NATURAL GAS The Kitchen Addition and Barn Stable will have connections to natural gas. This point of connection will occur along the existing line running to the south of the site at the location shown on the utility diagram. The project shall reuse the existing service lateral and gas meter if approved by the provider, Southern California Gas. FIBER OPTIC A ber optic line will be run from Sproul Hall for re communication. TELECOMMUNICATIONS Existing telecommunications conduits run along the western and southern side of The Barn Group. New runs will be required for some of the buildings. Feed to KUCR will come from the conduits running to the west. Feed to the Cottage will come from the vault to the south. Reusing the existing conduit to feed the Kitchen Addition is a possibility. The Telecommunications infrastructure is to be design by the Telecommunications consultant. A new AV switching mechanism will be placed outside Vault 3A. STEAM / CHILLED WATER The point of connection for steam and chilled water is in Tunnel Vault 15 to the south of Watkins Recital Hall. See utility diagram and the MEP narrative for more information. STORMWATER Stormwater shall be managed in order to meet LEED Credits 6.1 and 6.2 for stormwater runoff quality and quantity. Impervious areas will be minimized and stormwater will be treated as close as possible to the point at which it falls. Drainage design shall minimize piped flow and maximize overland surface flow to treatment areas. Permeable, interlocking pavers shall be used for hardscape surfaces wherever possible and congured for onsite inltration. Softscape treatments, such as rain gardens and bioswales, shall be integrated into the landscape design where feasible. During the design phase, effort should be made to keep stormwater management facilities visible, thereby enhancing The Barn Area as a demonstration project. Additional UC Riverside stormwater requirements, if more stringent than LEED, shall be met. GRADING / EARTHWORK Grading and earthwork will be minimized onsite and an effort will be made to balance cut and ll across the project. CIRCULATION Circulation will be improved via changes to the loading bay areas. The kitchen approach will be adjusted so that trucks approach from the south and pull into a new parking lane, allowing parking and unloading without trafc lane obstruction. CARBON CO2 emissions for the facility will be minimized through design and infrastructure selection. Additional vegetation will further offset carbon /#;\u0002\u0014\u001a\u000e\u0002\u0014\u0012\u0013\u0012SUPPORT DOCUMENTS System NarrativesLANDSCAPE The outdoor spaces of the Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 are a series of interconnected courtyards shaped by the surrounding buildings. A strong connection between indoor and outdoor spaces is achieved through large doors and wide exterior corridors. The landscape (layout, plantings, hardscape, and shade elements) will be designed to reflect the rich agricultural heritage of the region and The Barn Group. The Barn Walk, the main pedestrian route from the site to East Campus, is separated from the Sproul Hall service drive with a planted corridor of orange trees that tie into the existing orange grove to the north of the project. This citrus all\u00e9e will also function to screen the Sproul Hall loading dock from the project site. Bike trafc will use the service road with pavement striping to separate a bike lane. The Eucalyptus Walk, which approaches the project site from the east, terminates at the intersection with the Barn Walk. This important intersection will be studied during design so that it functions in several ways: as circulation, as a visual endpoint of the two walks, and as a courtyard garden/meeting place. One possible reference may be the historic rancho garden, with a courtyard of decomposed granite inset with informal plantings. The East Courtyard at The Barn and Cottage will be shaded by the large existing shade trees. This courtyard will have moveable furniture for dining and gatherings. The West Courtyard will be shaded by a large shade structure and used for dining and outdoor performances. A lower area in front of the Outdoor Stage will be used a flexible space for everyday dining or as an auditorium for performances. Moveable furniture as well as broad steps and other landscape elements will accommodate a variety of formal and informal seating. The Barn Stable will have its own patio enclosed by low walls or fences accessed by gates and will be separated from the rest of The Barn Group by plantings. Fencing and gates will be designed with transparency and security in mind. Wood and steel will be the primary construction materials. The design of the fences and gates will be integrated into the tertiary shade structures and planted trellises. The operable gates will allow for a variety of possibilities for enclosing the Barn Stable Patio and the West and East Courtyards. For instance, access to the West Courtyard performance area can be controlled by rolling gates to completely enclose this area for alcohol and ticketing control. The hardscape will be durable and light-colored to minimize the heat island effect. The design will consider areas of permeable paving to reduce runoff. Planted bio-swales will retain, clean, and slow down storm water before it reaches the storm water drainage system. Rainwater collection for onsite usage (toilet flushing, irrigation) will be considered. Other ornamental planting areas will feature drought-tolerant perennials and shrubs and will add softness, color, and aroma. The plant palette will include shade trees such as Sycamores and Oaks; citrus and possibly other fruit or nut trees (avocado, walnut); drought-tolerant native or Mediterranean perennials, featuring flowers suitable for cutting for use in dining table arrangements; shrubs; vines (grape or kiwi as potential edible vines.) There is also the possibility of an herb garden to be used by the Kitchen Addition. The approach to exterior lighting is a subtle integration of lighting xtures into the proposed built structures: recessed wall lights at steps and ramps; dimmable down lights from the West Courtyard Shade Structure; down lights from existing trees at the East Courtyard; downlights from the trellises at the Barn Stable Patio. Low path lights in planting areas adjacent to walkways will supplement where needed for circulation safety. Site work will include the necessary service access for Sproul Hall with a revised layout of parking spots and 3 dumpsters. Truck exiting this Loading Dock will back out onto West Campus Drive as they currently do; no turn around will be provided. Screening of the Sproul Hall Loading Dock will be achieved as mentioned above with a citrus all\u00e9e running along the Barn Walk. The design of the landscape will play a key role in ensuring a pleasant experience along West Campus Drive at the western edge of the project, which is largely a service area. The Drive Aisle that runs parallel to West Campus Drive allows for: truck delivery to the Kitchen Addition, access to KUCR parking, and a more continuous pedestrian experience. A carefully designed strip of plantings and trees will provide screening of this area. \u0002#4%*+6'%65118 7%\u00024+8'45+&'\u0002\u0002 ]\u0002\u00026*'\u0002$#40\u0002241,'%6\u00022*#5'5\u0002\u0013\u0002\b\u0002\u0014\u0002\u0002\u0002]\u0002\u0002 &'6#+.'&\u0002241,'%6\u0002241)4#/ /#;\u0002\u0014\u001a\u000e\u0002\u0014\u0012\u0013\u0012SUPPORT DOCUMENTS System NarrativesSTRUCTURAL THE BARN We do not anticipate needing to do any signicant work to the framing to resist vertical gravity loads. However, in many areas, the existing framing and siding appears to be near or in contact with the exterior grade. The building should be surveyed for water damage and repaired as needed. Based on a review of the available structural information, The Barn will most likely require a seismic upgrade as part of a comprehensive renovation. The structure is both too weak and too flexible in its current state, relative to modern safety standards. Fortunately, upgrading can be relatively straightforward and cost effective. The existing straight-sheathed roof diaphragm is inadequate to transfer seismic loads to the walls. It can be easily upgraded by adding a layer of plywood sheathing directly to the existing structure. This work would be integral with improving the insulation and re-roong the building. The proposal is to work above existing sheathing and keep in tact the structure as exposed from the inside. Once the existing roof has been removed to bare structure, the new plywood would be nailed directly to the framing. Because the building is currently not insulated, a layer of rigid insulation would be added over the new plywood. The insulation would change the appearance of the building by raising the roof by around six inches. To maintain the look of the exposed rafter-tails and roof overhang, the existing rafter-tails would be removed flush with the wall line. A new set of false tails would be set on top of the new plywood and overhang past the walls. The new framing would exist above the diaphragm, but within the layer of insulation. The overall appearance of the building would be similar, except that the building would be taller by the height of the new insulation. The roof framing forms a low monitor at the ridge, the full length of the building. The insulation layer would also be added to the monitor. To preserve the roof appearance similar to its current state, the exposed rafter framing at the monitor would be removed and replaced in kind. The new position would be higher due to the insulation. Like the rafter-tails of the main roof, the nal appearance of the monitor would be similar to the current state. The most cost effective and straightforward way to improve the seismic strength of the structure is to add new plywood sheathing to the existing wood stud framing. The wall locations best suited for new plywood are at the ends of the structure. In plan, the walls would appear as bookends. Both transverse wall elevations would be sheathed. Additionally, one segment of wall would be sheathed at each end of each longitudinal elevation. This placement of sheathing works well with existing walls, and would not disrupt the function of the building. The sheathing will be placed on the inside of the stud framing once gypboard nishes have been removed. This placement preserves the existing historic wood siding. It is recommended that the exterior of the Kitchen Addition be built with concrete masonry exterior walls with steel light gauge construction or wood stud for internal framing. If steel framing is selected for the interior, the walls would be steel studs and the roof would be framed with steel joists and beams partially supported by the exterior CMU walls. Because concrete masonry and steel joists have problems with thermal bridging, a layer of rigid insulation would most likely be needed outside of the walls and over the roof, to get satisfactory insulation. The roof sheathing would be shallow gauge metal deck with the CMU providing lateral strength for the walls. The foundations would be shallow wall footings with a slab on grade. The new construction would be seismically separated from the existing Barn Dining structure. If wood stud framing at the interior were used, the construction would be similar to the light gauge steel. The walls would be wood studs and the roof joists would be either solid lumber or engineered I-joist. The roof sheathing would be plywood. A seismic joint is needed to separate the CMU and existing wood structure. Unlike with steel framing, rigid insulation at the roof would not be necessary. Several issues should be considered in the selection of the framing system. The metal stud framing is considered to be straighter, and more durable with respect to moisture resistance. However, there would be several advantages to using wood framing. Wood framing is architecturally in keeping with the existing buildings of The Barn Group. It is also the most appropriate material from the prospective of environmental sustainability - especially if Forrest Stewardship Council (FSC) certied wood is used. Often wood framing is less expensive than other forms of construction. The issues of longevity can be addressed with good detailing practices that are supported by good maintenance. Finally, if wood framing were used throughout (instead of CMU for the exterior walls), then rigid insulation and a seismic joint would not be required.

The new site would be prepared with a new foundation supporting a concrete perimeter curb. Presently, areas of framing and siding appear to be in contact with the exterior grade. The building should be surveyed for water damage and repaired as needed. The lower portions of the stud framing and siding should be removed (approx. 6\") to have the building positioned on the new curb above grade. Like The Barn, the Barn Stable will most likely require a seismic upgrade as part of a comprehensive renovation. In a similar fashion, the structure can be strengthened and stiffened with plywood sheathing to meet modern standards. The existing roof diaphragm of corrugated metal sheathing is inadequate to transfer seismic loads to the walls. A layer of plywood sheathing can be added over the metal sheathing and fastened to the existing structure. This work would be integral with adding new rigid insulation and re-roong the building. Working above the existing corrugated sheathing will keep the exposed structure in tact from the inside. Like The Barn, the added insulation would change the appearance of the building by raising the roof by around six inches. However, a similar strategy of false exposed rafters would keep the overall appearance of the building similar to its present state. The seismic strength would be improved by adding new plywood sheathing to the existing wood stud framing. The sheathing would be placed on the inside of the stud framing. This placement removes the existing poor quality interior nishes and preserves the existing historic wood siding.New framing that is part of the stable building could be either light gauge metal or wood stud. The same issues noted for the Kitchen Addition apply here. COTTAGE The Cottage is to be relocated. The new site would be prepared with a new foundation. The structure presently has a wood framed floor that would be preserved. By altering the design of the perimeter curb and foundation, the nal height of the building could be set at various levels. The building could possibly be set relatively lower than its current state. This change would reduce the length and appearance of the new exterior ramps. The improvements to the seismic capacity of the building would be made by adding new plywood sheathing. The roof structure would be sheathed above the existing sheathing and the roof replaced. Because the cottage has flat ceilings, additional insulation would be placed in the cavity above the ceiling and below the roof. No changes to the eave framing would be needed. New wall plywood sheathing would be added to the interior face of existing stud framing, once interior nishes have been removed and replaced as needed. Additionally, the chimney anchorage would be improved for seismic resistance.KUCR The new structure that will house the KUCR radio station should be recognized as a very important building to the community for emergency response, especially after a major earthquake. The building is planned to be quite small with one story of approximately 4,500 sf. Because of its modest size, there is the opportunity to cost effectively make the structure stronger than a conventional building. Essential Facilities, such as police and re stations, are made 50% stronger relative to ordinary buildings in recognition of their importance to the community. Although the radio station has no such code requirements, we suggest that emergency broadcasts would be an essential function after a regional disaster. The structure can be made of many materials. We propose using concrete masonry walls in critical areas to get good acoustic performance. Other areas of framing could be of either wood stud or light gauge studs. The roof framing could be with either wood joists or light gauge steel joists. Where long spans are needed, such as over the Outdoor Stage and for the canopy, structural steel or glulam beams could be used depending on the architectural expression desired and depth requirements. The advantages of light gauge steel and wood framing listed for the Kitchen Addition also apply here.

The Barn foodservice demands require The Barn Kitchen to provide meals for The Barn and support for the Cottage, Barn Stable functions, catering and pre-packaged food items for Ivan's, a catering truck and potential food carts and a barbeque on the West Courtyard. Day part service is lunch, happy hour, dinner and potentially breakfast. Dining areas include interior seating with a small Indoor Stage at Barn Dining, outdoor eating at the West Courtyard with a large Outdoor Stage, and quiet courtyard on the east side of The Barn. The DMPS assigned area requirements by function for The Barn to support these foodservice requirements. This recent study and the earlier 2009 Barn Area Study (BAS) presented the need to expand the kitchen and servery. The 2009 BAS proposed an addition to the west side of The Barn to support the requirements but did not address the potential dining demand presented in the DMPS. Accordingly, additional kitchen expansion is necessary to support the anticipated foodservice demands. The DMPS proposed an operational style of order and pre-payment of meals with the customers recalled to the servery when the meals are ready, putting double circulation requirements on the servery. Thus the decision was made to change to a post-pay system in order to eliminate half of the required circulation space demand. It was also decided to forgo the use of china ware and instead use disposables, re-usable trays, and self-bussing stations located in each of the three dining areas. The servery has 4 food stations (Pizza, Salad/Cold Sandwich, Hot Sandwich/Specialty and Grill), as well as a self-serve beverage counter and two double sided dual tandem Point of sale (POS) counters. The condiment counter is to be located behind the beverage counter facing Indoor Seating. A bar window will be located on the west wall near the west POS station for wine and beer sales. All nish food preparation is \"on stage\" to promote fresh food, freshly prepared. The Kitchen functions include dry storage, catering storage, cold storage, cold food prep, hot food prep, catering staging, ware-washing and bar, ice machine, soda system room, change room and two ofces. The Service area is to support deliveries and house the storage of: empty vendor racks/bottles, a rellable CO2 tank, a trash compactor, recycling bins, and a used cooking oil tank. Access to staff restrooms is through the service area. It is anticipated that a remote compressor rack will be located on the roof. COTTAGE The Cottage is located east of The Barn and programmed to be a coffee house serving coffee- based beverages, hot tea, cold blended beverages, pastries, self-serve cold bottled beverages, pre- packaged salads and sandwiches. Day part service is breakfast, lunch, afternoon, and evening. Some exterior seating will be provided at the South Cottage Patio and the East Courtyard. It will be supported by The Barn kitchen with bulk storage and food prep. BARN STABLE This facility is located northeast of The Barn and will host occasional lunches, teas, dinner, meetings and banquet functions. A small pantry kitchen with grill, warming oven and dishwashing will be supported by The Barn Kitchen and will have a full service bar in a multi-function room and a patio. It is not programmed to operate as a restaurant on a daily basis. ('40#7\u0002 \b\u0002*#46/#0 \u0002#4%*+6'%65 121 The acoustical design issues include room acoustics, sound isolation, mechanical equipment noise and vibration control, and sound reinforcement. WEST COURTYARD The main outdoor courtyard space will be used for both dining and outdoor entertainment. Freeway noise and possibly mechanical system noise are potential issues in this space. To optimize the acoustical quality in the space as it is developed, the following should be considered: To the extent feasible, building massing should be used to block freeway noise into the outdoor use space. The building surfaces facing into the outdoor area space should be made sound absorbing to the extent feasible so as to mitigate echoes and reverberation. Overhead canopies, trellises, and other feasible design elements could work together to mitigate freeway noise intrusion into the outdoor area space, as well as to provide shading. Installing a high quality audio system could enhance the sound quality in this space. The sound system could be used for live performances, radio station broadcasts, background music, and campus wide announcements. If a trellis system is installed overhead, then loud speakers could be located in this structure to provide distributed sound at a acceptable sound level. A permanently installed sound system, if electronically controlled, could mitigate disturbing sound transfer to adjoining classroom buildings. BARN AND BARN STABLE Controlling excessive reverberation in dining and serving areas is important to the overall quality of the spaces. The sound absorbing material selected for these spaces need to be reconciled with the interest in having an exposed ceiling/roof structure. MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT NOISE AND VIBRATION CONTROL When designing controls for mechanical equipment noise and vibration both inside and outside the buildings, the recommended criteria will vary depending on the use of the space. A broadcast facility may require a background noise level of NC 20, where as an appropriate background noise level for a dining facility would be NC 40. The typical noise limit for mechanical equipment is 40 dBA in outdoor use areas such as dining. KUCR Sound intrusion into acoustically sensitive areas at the radio station is obviously important. During programming, the specic sound isolation requirements for each room were reviewed. Controlling excessive reverberation in broadcast, meeting and other areas must also be addressed. The selected criteria will be a combination of industry standards, our experience with similar projects, and the specic insights and requirements of the user group. The Master Control Room will serve as the primary on-air studio, accommodating larger interview and multi-person broadcast team use, and will also serve as a music mixing control and broadcast space for musical performances at the Outdoor Stage and the conference/performance space. The Production Studio(s) will be capable of operating as stand-alone on-air studios as well as pre-production editing spaces. One or two additional on-air microphone locations will be provided for small interview, multi-person broadcast and voice-over functions. High-performance acoustical isolation will be concentrated in at the Master Control Room, and may include a concrete floating floor to isolate low frequency noise from the attached (or at least adjacent), Outdoor Stage.

This will create a better performance environment for the on-stage performers as well as reduce the amount of \"stage-spill\" sound (sound projected directly from the Outdoor Stage versus that from the sound system), allowing better control of sound radiated to adjacent buildings and outdoor spaces. SOUND REINFORCEMENT Having a permanent sound reinforcement system associated with the exterior entertainment dining area will help limit sound emissions. This will minimize noise impact on adjoining outdoor and indoor use spaces, particularly the radio station. Locating and integrating the loudspeakers into an overhead trellis system could combine shading, aesthetics, and a distributed sound system. FREEWAY TRAFFIC NOISE To reduce trafc noise levels in the outdoor dining area, new buildings could be located to provide a noise barrier. This could be considered as a part of building massing studies. MISCELLANEOUS Sources of noise such as kitchen exhaust fans will also need to be reviewed so that the noise emissions do not annoy people in the vicinity, particularly outdoor use areas.

Three distribution options are proposed, all of which take advantage of the central campus chilled water and steam utilities. A central mechanical room located in the Barn will then distribute heating hot water and chilled water to the other buildings on site. Energy conservation will also be achieved by optimizing natural daylight, selecting energy efciency lighting, and using lighting controls such as occupancy sensors, photocells and dimmers. Low flow xtures are recommended for use throughout the site to reduce overall water use by at least 30%. 5.3 HEATING VENTILATION AND AIR C ONDITIONING (HVAC) Systems Design Philosophy: HVAC system components and distribution layouts will have the following characteristics: 1. Modular approach. 2. Energy and resource efcient. 3. Flexibility for future changes. 4. Durability. 5. Ease of maintenance. 6. Reliability. 7. Redundancy of critical components. 5.3.1 Codes and Standards NFPA Codes, current editions, as applicable ASHRAE Standard 62-2004 Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality ASHRAE Handbooks, current editions SMACNA Duct Construction Standards5.3.2 * Humidity control is not required in General Occupied Spaces, but may be necessary in Telecom / Data Equip Rooms, as recommended by equipment manufacturers. * Where radiant cooling is used comfort conditions will be maintained by designing to the operative temperature which incorporates both air temperature (DB) and mean radiant temperature. Outdoor Air Ventilation: Minimum Outdoor Air Ventilation rate will be 15 cfm / occupant, as recommended by Title-24 as it exceeds ASHRAE for dining spaces, based on maximum number of people in each space taken from Project Room Data Sheets, whichever is higher. Where the LEED EQ Credit dictates a higher air flow will be used. Internal Heat Gains: Heat gain from occupants will be calculated according to ASHRAE guidelines for maximum number of people in each space taken from Project Room Data Sheets. Heat gain from lighting will be calculated based on the actual layouts and xture types obtained from the electrical drawings. For energy efciency the lighting design will employ lower ambient lighting levels with task lighting. Heat gain from equipment will be based on information received from specialty consultants (i.e kitchen consultant, telecom, etc.) and project cut sheets. 5.3.3 Energy Efciency The UC system mandates that all new buildings are required to beat Title 24 by a 20% margin. The building will need to incorporate sustainable design measures to meet the requirement of LEED\u00ae Silver Rating. The building envelope shall be designed to beat the T-24 minimum requirements by a margin of 20%. T- 24 prescriptive envelope requirements for California Climate Zone 10 are given below: Roof R19 Wall R13 shall be selected to provide optimum Shading Coefcients / Solar Heat Gain Coefcients and U-factors on each exposure of the building. External shading is recommended where possible for non-north exposures. Glazed areas shall be optimized to maximize effective use of natural day-lighting and allow views to the exterior and to the interior. Operable windows will provide natural ventilation of rooms in perimeter zones (where applicable by program). Operable windows shall be under the control of occupants and the users will maintain the windows in the appropriate position when supplemental heating or cooling is provided from the mechanical system. HVAC systems will incorporate energy conserving features known to be economically feasible. The design will rst focus on passive systems such as thermal mass and natural ventilation (where applicable by program) which provide the most energy benet at the least cost. Once the cooling and heating loads have been minimized then the most efcient active systems will be explored. Technologies to be explored include, radiant cooling and heating, chilled beams, active thermal mass, heat recovery, dedicated 100% outside air economizer cooling cycle for air handling systems, CO2 sensors utilized to control minimum outdoor air, variable frequency drives for control of fans, and premium efciency motors. Additional energy conserving features, such as variable speed drives for pumps, indirect evaporative cooling of outdoor air, and heat recovery from exhaust systems will be evaluated during the Schematic phase and provided if shown to be economically feasible. Utilization of renewable energy sources, such as solar panels for water heating, wind power and/ or photo-voltaic power for supplemental power generation will be evaluated during the Schematic phase and incorporated into the project if shown to be economically feasible. Three (3) additional LEED\u00ae credits are available for renewable energy. 5.3.4 HVAC Systems The graph below shows an annual plot of temperature in Riverside as it relates to human comfort. As can be seen there is a dened heating and cooling season. In the peak of the cooling season there is a 15\u00b0F diurnal variation which allows for a night time purge cycle however there are periods where the night time temperature is above interior comfort conditions so the purge cycle would be limited in these months.Thus the buildings will need to be conditioned (heating and cooling) but will be done in a mixed mode fashion so that natural ventilation can be used in periods where conditions allow. Three ventilation and air conditioning systems appropriate for the building are being proposed for evaluation during the Schematic Design phase. The evaluation will be based on a life-cycle analysis considering capital rst cost, projected energy/operating costs, and maintenance cost.

Based on current thinking for building organization this is likely to be split into a single air handling unit per building. This system has the following characteristics: Option 2 is a Dedicated Outside Air System with radiant floors. For costing purposes 1/2\" tubing on 6\" centers may be assumed for radiant floors, with combined heating and cooling zones in a 15 foot perimeter band. The interior zones would be cooling only. Individual control of ofces and enclosed spaces (KUCR) would be provided. The ventilation system would be 1/3 the size of the all system described in Option 1 above. The optimum location for the ventilation air is at low level so the displacement effect can be used. The radiant floor assembly will consist of a topping slab with a total thickness of 3 inches. This includes 1 inch for insulation between the slab and topping slab, and a 2 inch thick topping slab. This system has the following characteristics:Option 3 is a dedicated outside air system with active chilled beams. The active beam density at the perimeter would be one 6 foot beam per 100 sq.ft. Individual control of ofces would be provided. In each option air handling system(s) will be draw- thru unit(s) with supply air fan, return/exhaust fan, outside air, return air and exhaust air dampers for 100% outside air economizer cooling cycle operation (option 1 only, option 2 and 3 are 100% outside air units without return fans or economizer), chilled water cooling coils, hot water heating coils, air lters, and acoustic attenuators as required to achieve design space noise levels. Indirect evaporative cooling units will be considered and evaluated for 100% outdoor air supply. Separate systems will be provided for areas with distinct functional or occupancy requirements and/ or operating schedules, continuous cooling/heating requirements, and/or other unusual requirements. Equipment will be selected with sufcient capacities to satisfy calculated building heating and cooling loads with allowances for future growth/remodeling of facilities as determined in collaboration with Campus engineering and facilities personnel. Cooling and heating coils will be selected in accordance with the requirements of the Campus Standards and Design Guidelines as follows: Chilled Water Cooling Coils; Hot water heating Coils; and, 450 fpm maximum coil face velocity. Minimum air lter efciencies will be selected to meet LEED\u00ae IEQ 5 criteria: MERV 13 for air handling systems serving all spaces.Temperature control zones will be provided as required by the building envelope design, space uses, occupancy, required times of operation, and/ or other special requirements. Any night time cooling strategies will take into account the occupant load prole and morning temperatures will not prevent uncomfortable conditions. Supply (or ventilation air) will be distributed throughout the building via insulated sheet metal ductwork and industry standard air diffusion devices. Displacement diffusers will be used in option 2. There will be no exposed berglass duct liner installed in supply ducts downstream of the air lters. Noise control will be achieved by the use of attenuators. Return air will be ducted where required, or transferred back to the air handling unit(s) via the ceiling plenums where the building design permits. Toilet rooms, janitor's rooms, food service and other areas where heat and/or odors are generated will be ventilated with mechanical exhaust systems. Food service areas will be served with dedicated exhaust and make-up air per the recommendations of the kitchen consultant. Exhaust fans will discharge minimum 10 feet above grade level and minimum 10 feet away from air intakes or other openings into the building. Mechanical rooms will be designed to accommodate equipment with adequate access and clearances for maintenance and replacement of components during the life of the equipment. Roof top air handling units are envisioned for the project.5.3.5 Cooling System - Chilled Water Supply & Return Site Utilities: Chilled water will be supplied to the building from existing campus Central Plant utility sources. Connection locations: Vault-15. It is anticipated that existing site utility systems have sufcient capacities to support the estimated additional loads to be imposed by the new and/or renovated structres. Actual loads will be veried during Schematic Design. It should be noted that Options 2 and 3 above require higher chilled water temperature than the 45F available. It is possible that return chilled water can be used to feed the chilled beams or chilled ceilings, raising the general Campus chilled water return temperature and not imposing a load on the chilled water supply. A hydraulic decoupler will separate the Campus and building chilled water supplies. Two (2) chilled water pumps, each sized for 60% of design flow, will be located in a mechanical room in the Barn. The arrangement and control of the pumps for alternating lead-lag operation will be in accordance with the Campus Standards and Design Guidelines. Variable frequency drives (VFDs) will be used if it is shown to be cost effective to do so. VFDs will be located in cooled spaces or where they can be effectively cooled by general building exhaust air. Cooling coils will be controlled by modulating control valves with DDC (Direct Digital Control) actuators. Chilled water supply and return piping will be insulated Schedule 40 black steel, or Type L copper. ('40#7\u0002 \b\u0002*#46/#0 5.3.6 Heating System Heating hot water for the complex will be supplied via the Campus steam loop. Heat transfer will via a tube and shell heat exchanger will occur in the mechanical room, located in the Barn. Two heating water pumps, each sized for 60% of total design flow, will distribute hot water to heating coils in air handling units and chilled beams/ radiant floors (and if provided at VAV boxes). The arrangement and control of the pumps for alternating lead-lag operation will be in accordance with the Campus Standards and Design Guidelines. Variable frequency drives will be used if it is shown to be cost effective to do so. VFDs will be located in cooled spaces or where they can be effectively cooled by general building exhaust air. Heating coils will be controlled by modulating control valves with DDC actuators. Heating piping will be Schedule 40 steel, or Type L copper piping, and will be fully insulated. 5.3.7 Central Plant Option An alternative approach to using the campus utilities as described in sections 5.3.5 and 5.3.6 is to build a dedicated central plant for the facility. The central plant would consist of a cooling tower, water-cooled chiller and condensing boiler. Primary pumps for condenser water, chilled water and heating hot water will be provided. Associated secondary pumps for chilled water and heating hot water will be as described in sections 5.3.5 and 5.3.6. Issues to consider with the central plant option include: requirement for outdoor space for the central plant facility (with covered structures for the chiller, boiler and pumps), acoustical impact of central plant on surrounding outdoor patios and programmed spaces, and additional maintenance requirements for the facility. 5.3.8 HVAC Controls A direct digital control (DDC) system will be provided for all HVAC equipment and systems. The system will include eld panels wired to a PC control front end and will be capable of stand-alone operation. DDC controls shall be BACnet per the Campus Standards and Design Guidelines.

These include: relocation of the Barn Stable and the utility work. Ideally this work would begin before Summer 2011. This phase will also include: the Kitchen Addition, the Cottage, the Loading Dock Area, and the Drive Aisle along West Campus Drive. The Kitchen Addition should be up and running before the end of summer to provide a functioning kitchen during the school year. The Kitchen Addition will require at least a 12-month window for completion.

The construction fence at the west side of The Barn will be close to the west side of the building, allowing for exiting only. This approach will provide a clean division between Phases 1 and 2. It was determined that construction activities during this phase would be too disruptive to allow for outdoor dining at the West Courtyard. Therefore, no seating in the West Courtyard will be provided during Phase 2.

The Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 DPP did not review the program for the Barn Theatre in depth, however phasing and implementation was considered. A challenge with the implementation of Phase 3 is that access to this area will be restricted by new and renovated structures once Phase 2 is complete. The Composite Site Organization Plan layout for KUCR was greatly influenced by the need for construction access and staging area for Phase 3 work.

The consultant team !s role for the Workshop #1 Interviews is primarily to listen to input from building users, not to question square footage changes. That will be addressed by the PMT.b.Dining has identified new needs and is currently engaged in a Dining Study Report which is not yet complete, but will be sent to the Consultant Team when available.Action: Susan Marshburn will ask Dining Services to provide the draft Dining Study for the Barn, and once available the completed Dining Study report. 2.\"Barn Annex\": There was a reminder that the building known as the \"Barn Annex\" should not be referred to as the University Club.

APPENDIX 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #1, 2/5/10 2/23/10 Page 2 of 61.Drawings Presented-Nine 24x36 boards: BAS Program Area Matrix Sheets for each building, BAS Site Analysis, Site Organization Options A, B and C.2.2009 Barn Area Study: Nita Bullock made a presentation summarizing the 2009 Barn Area Study and provided suggestions for how the Consultant Team could use it as the foundation for the DPP. The study included discussions with multiple stakeholders and developed a master plan that will serve as a strong baseline for moving forward. Following the presentation it was noted that the proposed phasing of the project has changed since the 2009 BAS was completed. For the DPP, phasing is now proposed as follows: Phase 1 includes the Barn Annex, and KUCR; Phase 2 includes the Barn Dining, the Cottage, and the Barn Kitchen. 3.Goal For Project: As defined by the BAS the goal for the Barn Project is to become a \"Unique Dining and Entertainment Center.\"4.Additional Goals: To expand food serviceby about 3 times the current level and to expand entertainment to have a full schedule throughout the week.JN5.Historical Status: Per the 1993 Historical Resources Inventory, the buildings are not currently designated as having historic status, however the group of buildings as a whole has the potential at a local or regional level to have historical status as a campus cultural resource. There is currently an RFP to prepare an updated Historical Resources Inventory for the Barn Group. This study is needed as soon as possible to support the DPP process. In general the PMT and SC want to maintain the character of the existing buildings without the formality of a historical designation.Action: Jacqueline Norman will provide the Historical Resources Inventory report to F&H as soon as it is available.6.Landscape:a.Clearance for Service and Fire Vehicles: 20!-0\" wide by 13 !-6\" highb.Suggested Plant Types: Do not use Eucalyptus. Drought tolerant species are preferred. The Barn Project is part of a special agricultural planting area. Suggested plantings include: Citrus, Avocado, and herb gardens. Large canopy trees and arbors for shade are encouraged.RR7.Fire Protection Issues: Interview with Campus Fire Marshal, Scott Corrina.Historical Status: If the buildings are not given historical status, there will be different restrictions for fire protection, design, and new construction in general.b.Fire Protection Systems: All buildings will need to have sprinklers and early fire alarm ADA notification systems.c.Bringing Project up to Current Code Requirements: There was some discussion about whether to consider the Barn Group as a single complex or as a collection of individual buildings, separated by \"imaginary property lines.\" Further clarification / direction is needed. The project will use the most recent building codes.Action: Richard Racicot will review fire protection issues with Campus Fire Marshall and will report back to the Committee. d.Drawing Review: If the project is designated with historic status it will be reviewed by both the State Fire Marshall and local fire authorities. If the project is not designated with historic status it will be reviewed by just the State Fire APPENDIX Workshop #1: 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #1, 2/5/10 2/23/10 Page 3 of 6Marshall. If Alternate Means are requested then it will go to the local fire authorities for review, which could cause delays.e.Fire Truck Access: Scott Corrin considers the fire lane access along the Sproul Hall to be \"existing non-conforming.\" He also determined that a fire truck turnaround is not needed and in the event that a service turnaround is provided the fire truck will use it on an interim basis, until the fire lane through to the Carillion Mall is completed as part of a separate future project.JH8.Physical Plant: Interview with Physical Plant representatives, Mike Terry a.Truck Turnaround: A study is being conducted on the refuse trucks, which are the largest used in the Sproul Loading Dock, to determine if the vehicles will require a 48 foot radius (the City of Riverside Standard). Backing up the trucks to West Campus Drive presents safety concerns.Action: Jon Harvey will follow up with Mike Terry to obtain truck turning radius. b.Sproul Loading Dock: One consideration for the Loading Dock as proposed in the BAS is coordination with the existing infrastructure, including stand pipes, in this area. Fumes and noise in the tight space between the two buildings was also brought up as a concern. This could be managed by scheduling refuse pick ups earlier in the morning before classes start.c.Access: Access by unauthorized vehicles will continue to be restricted by the existing gate.d.Separations:For safety reasons the pedestrian area should be separated from the vehicular areas with a physical barrier. A landscape buffer is suggested in the BAS. e.Bicycles: The bicycle lane is currently grouped with the vehicle lane. This is not ideal. The separation of pedestrians from bikes and bikes from other vehicles at UCD was referred to as a possible model.9.KUCR: Interview with the General Manger of KUCR, Louis Vandenberga.Introduction:Louis Vandenberg gave a brief introduction to the history, special issues and needs of KUCR.b.Significance: This will be the first UC that has built a facility especially to house a campus radio station.c.Concerns: Safety is a very important concern, especially with KUCR being moved to a building adjacent to outdoor entertainment venue where alcohol will be served.d.Stage: The stage will provide opportunities to air live interviews, full band performances and other lower scale events.e.Tower: KUCR would like to reuse the existing (original) tower, which has significance for the radio station!s history and is also the correct height for line of sight to the Box Spring Mountains. It is not possible to mount the tower on top of a building.f.Misc: The radio station will need a kitchenette (addition to the BAS). g.Archive: Making the archive visible while maintaining security is appealing. The archive is a \"fantastic collection of very rare stuff.\"h.New Building vs. Existing: Having KUCR in the Barn Area is the \"best idea ever\" for relocation. A new building would allow for easier customization to meet the current and future needs. The Barn Stable provides a connection to the \"deep, long history of this place.\" In either case the production studios should be located in a new building.APPENDIX Workshop #1: 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #1, 2/5/10 2/23/10 Page 4 of 610.Barn Annex: Interview with Dining and Food Services and University Club representatives: Andy Plumley, Susan Marshburn, Cheryl Garner, and Connie Younga.University Club History: Connie Young provided a brief history and special considerations for the University Club. b.Partnership: The University Club will rent space in the Barn Annex from Dining and Food Services, and the University Club will continue to provide a liquor license.c.Liquor License: The University Club holds a liquor license which allows the Barn to serve Beer and Wine, and the Club area to have a full bar.d.Kitchen: The Annex will have a finishing kitchen only.e.Outdoor Area: A dedicated outdoor area for the Barn Annex is desirable.f.Interior Room Changes: Instead of a Banquet Room and separate Bar as proposed in the BAS, there will be one large room that should feel comfortable when only a portion is used. The bar will be able to open and close into this room with some type of moveable screen or shutters.LL JH11.Barn Dining: Interview with Dining and Food Services representativesa.Outdoor Spaces: A variety of spaces and seating is desired. The west courtyard will be the loud entertainment area, and the east will be the more formal dining area. Heaters and misters are also desirable.b.Food Service Concept: The food service concept was discussed at length. Larry Lanier will follow up with Cheryl Garner to better determine needs and possible solutions. Action: Larry Lanier will review and update food service program with Cheryl. c.Character: The Barn should have a different character than the HUB, which is identified as having \"a more slick food court feel.\" Overall the project should showcase the agricultural heritage of UCR through various means including a farmer !s market, and use of citrus and herb gardens.d.Seating (change from BAS): 188 outdoor seats, and 108 indoor seats are required. A variety of seating options including built-in to reduce the need to move furniture for events.e.Kitchen: The Barn will support catering and satellite operations.f.ADA: A recent draft ADA study for the Barn identified many issues of non-compliance including that the truss buttresses will require cane detectable barriers which will affect the look and seating capacity around the buttresses.ADA compliance will be carefully reviewed during the design phase. A final ADA Transition Plan for the existing Barn complex is being prepared; PMT will send to consultant team when completed.Action: Jon Harvey will send Barn Theater ADA Report to F&H, and once available, will provide final ADA Transition Plan. APPENDIX Workshop #1: 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #1, 2/5/10 2/23/10 Page 5 of 6JH12.Barn Theater: Interview with CHASS representativesa.General: The Barn Theater is not part of Phases 1 or 2 as there is no funding identified for this project.b.Rehearsal Space:CHASS would like to be able to join two rehearsal spaces into one.c.Stage: Sharing a stage is acceptable.d.Box Office: A box office for charging admissions for performances is desirable and could be shared with the Barn.e.Confirm Area Sizes: The PMT will confirm the space requirements of CHASS for the interior rehearsal space and storage.Action: Jon Harvey will follow up with Nate Jones (CHASS), who will provide comments on the Barn Theater program presented in the BAS. 13.Site Analysis: The Consultant Team gave a brief presentation of the issues and questions raised by the site plan as proposed in the BAS. Following this presentation Mike Delo from TAPs brought up the following issues: a.Cross Walk: The cross walk linking Lot 4 to Barn Group is in a poor location, consider relocating as part of project.b.Bus Pull Out: An additional bus pull out is needed on the opposite side of West Campus Drive from the Barn.c.ADA Parking: Disabled parking by the Barn Group is a priority. d.Special Student Services:Need to maintain the existing 2 parking spaces for Special Student Services.e.Bike Parking: Location of the bike parking is another consideration.The LRDP and the Multi-Modal Transportation Management Analysis suggests bike corrals at the periphery of the Carillon Mall. One is proposed at the northwest corner of Sproul on the south side of the Mall walkway.LH & SL14.Cost: Based on a very brief initial review of costs in the 2009 BAS, that was done by F&H in preparation for the interview, the budget seems tight. To meet the budget it is important to keep the buildings the same size or smaller than the BAS. The Consultant Team will review the preferred scheme in relation to the current budget.Action:Laura Hartman will review the 2009 BAS estimate with Scott Lewis(Cost Estimator) and provide comments on the current construction 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #1, 2/5/10 2/23/10 Page 6 of 6F&H15.Site Organization Options Discussion: The Consultant Team presented three options for the site plan that tested various issues: Site Organization Option A, \"Agricultural History at the Courtyard,\" would leave the Barn buildings around the Western Courtyard. Site Organization Option B, \"Agricultural History at the Barn Walk\", relocates the Barn Stable to serve as the Barn Annex and houses KUCR in a new building. Site Organization C, \"Larger Courtyard\" is similar to Option B, but pushes the new KUCR building towards West Campus Drive to widen the Western Courtyard. Site Organization Option B was chosen as the best for developing a composite plan that will be studied further to address the following modifications: f.Cottage:Study shifting the Cottage to the North to avoid the utilities at the Eucalyptus Walk.g.Barn Annex: Study shifting the historic portion of the Barn Annex (relocated Barn Stable) to the south.h.Bathrooms: Locate the East Courtyard bathrooms along the Barn Walk and review incorporating them into a trellis structure to reduce visual impact.i.KUCR:Review concepts for a new two-story building to house the radio station and as a backdrop to a single shared stage.j.Barn Loading Dock: Study options for reducing the visual impact of the loading dock.Action: F&H will prepare a composite plan that addresses the site organization issues.JWRR16.Next Steps:a.Area Study Comparison:The Consultant Team will prepare an Area Study Comparison of the BAS and the current proposal.Action:Jason Wilkinson will furnish aProject Area Summary with comparison table of preliminary program and the 2009 BAS.b.Studies: The PMT will expedite additional information for the Consultant Team including the ADA report, Historic Resources Inventory, and underground utility survey. As-builts will be required as the project moves into SD.c.Site Survey: Cost of a site survey will be investigated.Action: Richard Racicot will identify the cost of the site survey for consideration. d.Site Plans: The existing road will be shown as the basis for the site plans in the DPP. The future location of the road, as shown in the 2009 BAS, will be shown \"dashed\" in the DPP.e.KUCR: The Consultant Team will contact Louis Vandenberg to discuss options for housing KUCR in a new building.f.2/11 Draft Materials from F&H: The Consultant Team will send out draft materials including a list of questions from the sub-consultants regarding building systems and sustainability, and the draft room data sheets. g.2/18 Responses to Draft Materials: UCR will return comments and responses to the draft materials sent on 2/11.APPENDIX Workshop #1: 1 & 2 -Action Item Status Table 2/23/10 Page 1 of 2ISSUED: February 23, 2010 ACTION ITEM STATUS TABLE PROJECT: DPP - UCR Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 The Action Item Status Table is meant to summarize the action items raised at the meeting(s) listed above and responsible party for each action it em.

A schedule for the completion of this work will be provided by the Jacqueline Norman once the contract is finalized. The scope of the work is limited to the historic review and does not include a review of the building condition as proposed by several RFP respondents. b.Utility Survey (1.03): An underground scan of the site utilities has been completed. The data is being transferred into a CAD format and will be reviewed by the Physical Plant. Jacqueline Norman will provide the completed underground utility survey drawings as soon they are available. APPENDIX Workshop #2: Project 2 -DRAFT Meeting Notes from Workshop #2, 2/26/10 3/15/10 Page 2 of 2c.As-built Drawings:The only CAD format As-built Drawings for the Barn buildings are the existing floor plans prepared by Nakada for the BAS. Elevations, sections and other drawings will be needed as the project moves forward into Schematic Design. F&H to provide a fee for preparing As-built Drawings as part of the design phase. .d.Site Survey (1.05): Richard Racicot will review the cost of a site survey.e.Utility Connection Point Survey: A subsurface survey of the area between the Barn Group and the proposed utility connection pointwill be completed once it is determined which connection point the project will use.3.Project Area Summary:a.Barn Dining: Larry Lanier is concerned that the space allocation for interior seating at the Barn Dining is too tight on a SF per person basis. Susan Marshburn emphasized that the program must meet the seat count for the Barn Dining per the Dining Study. Andy Plumley suggested that the allocation be generous rather than tight. The issue will be discussed during the Workshop.4.Cost:a.Cost Estimate: Laura Hartman related that Scott Lewis the Cost Estimator was nervous with the BAS cost estimate and is more nervous after reviewing the Project Area Summary (comparing the Preliminary Program and BAS Program). Increasing the size of the Barn Dining was his main concern. The additional cost of a two-story building for KUCR and moving the Barn Stable is potentially offset by omitting the basement below the Barn Stable and adapting the historic building to the technological challenges of a radio station as proposed in the BAS.b.Cost and Increasing Areas: Increases to the areas from the BAS will most likely result in an increase in the project cost. Susan Marshburn suggested that the Kitchen Addition to the Barn Dining is the heart of the project if the project areas do increase it is where the growth should occur.5.LEED / Sustainability: Kenyon with the Office of Design and Construction will be present for the workshop to share his experience with LEED through his involvement in another UCR project that is currently seeking LEED Certification.APPENDIX -UCR Barn 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #2, 2/26/10 03/15/10 Page 1 of 8ISSUED: March 15, 2010 MEETING NOTES Workshop #2: Site Plan Options; Building Systems; Sustainability PROJECT: DPP - UCR Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 TIME/ DATE: 9:30 AM - 4:30 PM, February 26, 2010 LOCATION: Capital and Physical Plan ning Offices, Bannockburn, J -102 ATTENDEES : Project Management Team Don Caskey Associate Vice Chancellor, Campus Architect Kieron Brunelle Director, Capital and Physical Planning Richard Racicot Assistant Vice Chancellor ,Design and Construction Jacqueline Norman Senior Project Manager, Office of Design and Construction Jon Harvey Principal Education Facilities Planner, Capital and Physical Planning Andy Plumley Assistant Vice Chancellor, Auxiliary Services Susan Marshburn Associate Directo r of Housing Services Steering Committee Andy Plumley Assistant Vice Chancellor, Auxiliary Services Susan Marshburn Associate Director of Housing Services Cheryl Garner Director of Dinning Services Nita Bullock Director ofPhysical Planning, Cam pus Landscape Architect Campus Representatives Tim Gable Communications Pat Simone Assistant Director, Physical Plant Pat Nugent Physical Plant Mike Terry Physical Plant Eric Shuler Supervisor, Electrical Shop Hassan Ghamlouch Director of H ousing Operations Louis Vandenberg KUCR General Manager Tricia D.

JH F&H2.Utilities: Representatives from UCR Physical Plant provided information regarding existing utilities.a.General Utility Issuesi.Building footprints need to be at least 5 feet away from center of utility lines.ii.Separate meters for buildings are proposed for leasing/billing purposes as well as for attaining LEED credits.iii.Jon Harvey to follow up with Physical Plant to provide draft building standards to Consultant Team.iv.Connections should be shared as much as possible to reduce trenching.b.Electricali. Points of ConnectionThere are multiple options for electrical connections. Vault 3A (near West Campus Drive and Humanities) is proposed for all primary connections although Vault 4A (west of Sproul Hall) would also suffice and is less congested. A benefit of Vault 3A is that it is located in a grass area.Copper piping is preferred; no aluminum.AV switching mechanism to be placed outside the vault.Replace the existing transformer and 800 amp service with a new service to handle full complex.Abandon the existing conduit and consider reuse for data/telecommunications.ii.CottageRun from Vault 13 to Vault 14 is currently empty.Two vaults exist near the proposed Cottage location; one is for telecommunications and the other is empty. The Cottage may have to shift to the north to avoid several utility lines.The new footing of the relocated Cottage can be directly adjacent to a vault. If a new vault is needed it should be concrete.iii.KUCRThere is an existing duct bank at the proposed KUCR location. Recommendation from Physical Plant is that service for KUCR and Barn Theater comes from west of existing Barn Stable.The new building footingscan span over the existing electrical line, but plans and construction must protect conduits in place..c.Water / Sewer:110 psi soft, hot water service to Kitchen Addition proposed.i. Points of Connection: Multiple lateral connections are preferred to a single tap. Manhole proposed at location of incoming supply.ii.Reroute 12\" Line at KUCR: The existing 12\" water line that runs north/south to the west of the Barn Stable will need to be rerouted further west to accommodate the KUCR addition. The footings of the KUCR addition should not be placed over this water supply. iii.Sproul Loading Dock: The truck turnaround at Sproul loading dock may impact sewer or water lines. F&H will review Sproul loading dock for impact on utilities.d.Steam + Chilled Wateri.A central plant at UCR provides steam and chilled water throughout APPENDIX Workshop 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #2, 2/26/10 03/15/10 Page 3 of 8JNCampus. Connecting to this system at vault 15 (south of Sproul Hall) is proposed for the Barn Project.ii.No PVC to be used; only steel.iii.3-way bypass valves (per campus standard) to be used (Physical Plant to provide standards).iv.Minimum of 60\u00b0F return water temperature for chilled water.v.BTU meters provided on steam and chilled water.e.Gas: Gas is provided by Southern California Gas.f.Storm Wateri.Policy: The DPP recommended approach to storm water management will be tailored to fit Campus standards. Jacqueline Norman to follow-up with Tricia Thrasher for information regarding the campus-wide storm water policy.ii.Approach:Careful management of storm water can respond to the agrarian nature of the buildings.Bioswales, rainwater harvesting, and fossil filters are options for retention and treatment of storm water. Points of Connection:Multiple points of connection are available. Currently, a 12\" drain runs N-S through the drive to the east of the site while a 24\" line runs E-Wto the south of the site (just outside Kitchen Addition and Barn Dining).g.Telecommunications:The Barn Area contains 2 conduit runs; the current feed on the south side of Barn Dining and an existing duct bank on the west side, from which the new KUCR building and Barn Annex should be fed. The two manholes near the proposed location for the Cottage will likely serve as the connection point for the project.JHRR3.Additional Itemsa.Building Envelope:Improvements to be made to improve energy performance, including improved daylighting, structure, and insulation.b.Historical Character: Completion of the historical report is important for understanding possibilities for design changes.c.Tree of Concern:Existing legacy tree on site (an English walnut grafted to a black walnut) is relevant to the history of the UCR campus; would be great to preserve the tree.Mike Terry via Jon Harvey will verify the location of tree trunk.d.Paving: Office of Design and Construction is currently in the process of developing standards for the use of interlocking pavers. Richard Racicot to provide a copy of the standards when available.4.LEED / Overview of Sustainability Strategiesa.Project is mandatedtoachieve LEED Silver Certification minimum.Project will be certified as a single project.b.Desire for simple sustainable systems. Low-tech, passive, cost-effective systems are seen as most beneficial (well-designed daylighting, use of campus chilled water and steam system, etc.)c.There is an opportunity for the project to be a pilot project as presented in the Draft UCR Sustainability Action Plan and serve as an education tool.The project will emphasize cost-effective sustainable strategies while illustrating a campus-wide dedication to sustainable practices. It is important to continue a careful assessment of short- and long-term costs involving both first costs and maintenance costs.APPENDIX Workshop #2: 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #2, 2/26/10 03/15/10 Page 4 of 85.HVACa.Systemsi.Passive systems are preferred (passive solar, campus-wide steam andchilled water, insulation, possible solar water heating, kitchen heat reclaim, etc.). The project should tap into existing campus-wide efforts whenever/wherever possible.ii.Sustainable systems to be weaved into all parts of the project, both existing and new.b.Thermal Comforti.For certain areas of the program, setting a wider range of occupants!thermal comfort will improve efficiency. However in the kitchen and other food preparation areas increased temperature fluctuations are not tolerable.ii.Improved air circulation, large ceiling fans, radiant floor heating/cooling, and zoning are all approaches that will improve the performance of the buildings.iii.Due to the varied use of the spaces (some spaces will host both small groups and large gatherings), the buildings will need to respond quickly and efficiently to abrupt changes in heating/coolingdemands. F&H6.Structurala.Durability and seismic resistance are part of sustainability.b.An assessment of the structural impact and extent of the dry rot at the existing buildings will be completed during Schematic Design.c.KUCR: For new construction, wood frame is most cost effective. Steel studs and block construction are also options.d.Cottage: Moving the Cottage offers the opportunity to address dry rot at the base.By putting the crawl space below grade, it becomes possible to reduce the amount of ramps required for access.e.Cottage + Barn Annex: F&H will investigate the different approaches to moving buildings.f.Barn Dining: There may be missing canted beams. The proposed layout lends itself nicely to introducing shear walls at the north and south ends of the building.7.Composite Site Plana.General Issuesi.Cottage: May need to move to the north to avoid existing utilities. A ramp up to the front entrance/porch rather than around to the rear entrance as shown in BAS may be preferable.ii.Barn Annex: Will act to buffer the associated outdoor terrace from the Sproul loading dock to the east. Also, incorporation of a trellis or low walls around the terrace will help to create an enclosed, yet open space for gathering. The existing Barn Annex sliding doorswill provide a strong indoor / outdoor connection as well as ample daylight. (\"Think wedding\" -CG)iii.Barn Dining: Space is open to both courtyards (east and west).iv.KUCR: Current design has the KUCR building as two-stories, with different options for stacking. Questions on adjacencies still remain. The placement APPENDIX Workshop 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #2, 2/26/10 03/15/10 Page 5 of 8F&HF&HF&HF&H APF&HCGCGof KUCR and the orientation of its entrance make it a visible destination from the north. A next step is for KUCR to provide input on program adjacencies.v.Performance Courtyard: Need to further address acoustical concerns and stage/equipment layout. F&H to obtain a proposal for a quick review by the team !s theater consultant (Landry & Bogan).vi.Ticket Office: This newly proposed space should be included in the project program. It could be stand-alone or could potentially function as a permanent space attached to another building (not attached to Barn Theater). F&H to add the Ticket Office to Project Area Summary.vii.F&H to produce overlay sketches on site plan: how \"stuff\" can be moved and site security.viii.F&H to roughly determine the latitude and longitude of proposed location of KUCR radio tower using Google Earth for understanding any conflicts with line of sight to the Box Spring Mountains.ix.Jon Harvey will examine options to provide approximate tree locations in a timely manner (as part of 3.c. above). b.Securityi.In order to maintain a strong connection to Campus, The Barn Area should feel open to pedestrian circulation. However it needs to be able to be fully enclosed at times due to security concerns and for alcohol containment.Gates between buildings and location of fencing will be studied by F&H (Action Item 7.a.vii).ii.The backstage area for the outdoor stage (currently proposed as a part of the KUCR building) needs to function separately from the radio station. Different groups, many of which are not connected to KUCR, will be using this space to prepare for performances and should not have access to the rest of the building. Clarification on this issue from LV and theater consultant is needed.c.Liquor License:Currently, the University Club holds an ABC license, which it extends to Barn Dining. Physically removing the University Club from Barn Dining complicates this relationship, as alcohol service must be contained within the space occupied by the license-holding body. Andy Plumley toobtain additional information to determine whether the license can be modified, fencing options, or if a new ABC license for Barn Dining is required.d.Access / Circulationi.KUCR needs space for a loading dock. F&H to study KUCR loading dock south of KUCR near Barn Dining loading dock.ii.Bussing trash and dishes around the site remains an issue.Trash: Need to make sure there is adequate space for trash binsthroughout the site. Cheryl Garner will determine if a compactor is needed West of Kitchen Addition. Athree foot wide sidewalk along the South side of Barn Dining is needed to transport materials from East courtyard and provide a connection between the Cottage and Barn Dining.Bussing dishes: Cheryl Garner to determine if Dining will use permanent or disposable dishware. If permanent dishware is chosen, it will be difficult to transport dishes to/from the dishwashing station in Kitchen Addition. Dishes will be coming from Barn Dining as well as from Cottage and Barn Annex, making transportation difficult. Also, a bussing station along the path to the East of the site may be needed to APPENDIX Workshop #2: 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #2, 2/26/10 03/15/10 Page 6 of 8help with transporting food.iii.The service road will also be a cyclist path with the goal of removing cyclists from using the pedestrian path.e.Costi.Laura Hartman spoke with the project !s cost estimator (Scott Lewis), who has said that he \"was nervous before\" about the budget and \"is more nervous now.\" Increasing the size of the project will increase the budget.f.Implementation / Phasingi.During construction, the central courtyard may be used as a staging area. Also, a portion of Parking Lot 4 may be utilized as well (for contactor !strailer, etc.).ii.West Courtyard and KUCR could be implemented at the same time.iii.Kitchen Addition, Barn Dining, and Barn Annex could be completed first.iv.Implementation to be discussed further at Workshop #3. F&H, AP JH8.Programminga.KUCRi.LV is concerned that the proposed space allocation may not meet his needs. He prefers a larger performance area within the station for band performances/discussions/interviews. LV is unfamiliar with the process of planning new buildings, but is an expert in radio stations.ii.Clarification of program needs shows that the spaces needed are:Two production rooms of equal size. The size of existing rooms is adequate (about 10 ! x 11 !).Two smaller post-production rooms (soundproof spaces with closing doors measuring about 8 ! x 5!)Several post-production edit bays- Further discussions with Louis is needed to determine sizes of post-production edit bays spaces.The idea of the conference room being used as a performance room was supported.Interview / program host space will need to be largerThe Backstage Space, should be separate from KUCR but adjacent to performance stage. F&H and the Theater Consultant to work with AP to determine required size and needs for the Backstage Space.Server / transmission room approximately 10 ! x 10 !.Lobby should allow for about 6 people to sit/lounge comfortably, size to be determined.Private office space for 4 peopleoMusic + News / Public Affairs office: an open office with 2 large stations used to process and catalog materialsTwo storage rooms: one for internal use, one for loading live remote equipmentThree parking spaces; one will need to be an ADA space. Also, the parking situation needs to accommodate loading/unloading via a small pickup truck. Any additional parking needs will be met at Parking Lot 4.Libraryhas three primary audio formats: vinyl records, CDs, and archival tapes (reel-to-reel, cassette, and broadcast cartridge); should be secure and consolidated, not scattered about.oLVvolunteered to measure the linear length of the KUCR library materials. Jon Harvey to track.oVisibility of the collections is desirable.APPENDIX Workshop 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #2, 2/26/10 03/15/10 Page 7 of 8F&H, SL F&Hb.Dining Servicesi.IssuesSince the BAS, Dining has brought in a master planning group to look at the feasibility of the project; some concerns remain.The proposed program has 1,323GSF more than 2009BAS. Current drawings are based on footprints from BAS.In order to determine order of magnitude costs increase it is necessary to determine the cost per square foot. F&H and Cost Estimator, Scott Lewis, to determine the order of magnitude cost increase for the increase to the building program.ii.Kitchen AdditionCurrent Concerns:oAt least two offices will be needed oRestrooms inside Kitchen Addition can be eliminated, but a changing room will be needed in their place. An additional office may also occupy some of the space formerly assigned to the restrooms.!Proposed restrooms at Northwest corner of Kitchen Addition will suffice for employees. A \"dog trot\" configuration, or two rooms on either side of a open hall, will be studiedoDry storage has been reduced; space will be tight.oMore space is needed for hot food preparation / grill.oCheryl Garnerproposed that the bar pop out into the WestCourtyardin an effort to provide more square footage for food preparation. If sufficient space cannot be gained from this move, Kitchen Addition may need to be widened.!The form of these possible additions/shifts needs to be studied.!Bar still needs to serve both inside and outside and should be able to be staffed by one person.oOne concern is that there is currently no area for catering equipment storage. This are will be for storing chafing dishes and mobile cartsiii.Barn DiningCurrent Concerns:oLack of seated dining space within Barn Dining.!May need to decrease the size of the interior stage or make part of it removable to accommodate additional seating.!Servery queuing could possibly begin outside Barn Dining rather than upon entering Servery.!Kitchen Addition could possibly extend to the west. F&H to review truck turning at Barn Dining Loading Dock.!Additional outdoor seating may be added to west and east of Barn Dining (Laura Hartman !s proposed porch-like seating scheme).iv.Barn Annex: Bar can be reduced to 100 sf. It will require counter space for abartender and storage for all bar needs.Currently, there is no storage space for tables and chairs. This space will need to be 250 sf.9.Next Stepsa.Utilities -There are several options for utility connections that need to be studied. The final underground utility survey will aid in understanding the utility options. b.Historical Survey -The Historical Resources Survey that is being prepared will help determine design flexibility for the existing structures.APPENDIX Workshop #2: 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #2, 2/26/10 03/15/10 Page 8 of 8c.LEED / Sustainability -There is a need for further review of the sustainability goals as they relate to the budget, the requirement for LEED Silver Certification and Campus-wide sustainability efforts.d.HVAC and Thermal Comfort -In general the project should use passive systems for heating and cooling. However there is a need for certain spaces, such as the Kitchen, to maintain a tight range of thermal comfort, in which case more intensive mechanical systems may be necessary.e.Structural -There is a need for a better understanding of the options for seismic resistance and how the Barn Annex and Cottage could be moved.f.Site Plan -i.The Cottage may need to shift from its proposed location to avoid utilities.ii.Security - Security will need to be studied in relation to the desire to maintain a connection to open feeling campus. iii.How \"stuff\" is moved around the siteneeds to be studied.iv.Input from the Theater consultant is needed to address various programmatic questions about the indoor and outdoor stage.g.Cost -The Cost Consultant will provide information about the order of magnitude cost increase related to increasing the program areas.h.KUCR -Many questions remain about the needs of KUCR. A discussionwith the Acoustical Consultant is needed to help understand the KUCR program.i.Barn Dining -Barn Dining will be studied by Cheryl Garner and Larry Lanier to address concerns about Kitchen space allocation and layout, and sufficient space for interior seating.j.Implementation and Phasing will be discussed in detail at Workshop #3.k.See also attached Action Items ListAPPENDIX Workshop 1 & 2 -DRAFT Action Item Status Table 3/16/10 Page 1 of 4ISSUED: March 16 , 2010 ACTION ITEM STATUS TABLE PROJECT: DPP - UCR Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 The Action Item Status Table is meant to summarize the action items raised at the meeting(s) listed above and responsible party for each action item .

If they differ from your recollection, please contact Fernau & Hartman immediately.ACTION BY:ITEM:1.KUCR:a.Concerns were raised about the cost of KUCR being two stories as well as the size of program and the inefficient net-to-gross ratio. b.KUCR currently has approximately 2,000 ASF in their existing space. The current program adds 800 ASF, however the total building is 5000 GSF. Options to consider include: a single story KUCR;a careful review of non-assignable spaces;a review of what can be stored off-site and which items currently being stored can be disposed of. c.Housing and Dining Services would like to understand phasing in order to develop a business plan and cash flow model, which is needed for approval of the project.F&H2.Performances: a.Theater Consultant: F&H to provide a revised proposal from Theater Consultant to ensure that crowd control, lighting, sound cueing, and stage support spaces are included. The cover letter will be revised to include the appropriate participants for the conference call. APPENDIX Workshop #3: Barn Project 2 - Meeting Notes from PMT #3, 3/19/10 4/08/10 Page 2 of 2b.Seating capacity will drive the types of performances that will take place.c.A goal is to provide the ability to use each facility independently and a concern with sound transmission from one location to another was identified. The project will need to address acoustic issues so sound from the west courtyard stage not disrupts food sales in the Barn. The project will also address sound transmission from one location to another within reason. Complete acoustic separation is not a condition. 3.Meeting Goals: The following goals are critical issues to address in Workshop #3:a.Finalize project program areas and allocation.b.Finalize Site Organization Plan.SMJNJNRRJHJHF&HJHJNRRAP4.Action Items:a.Dining Study (1.01): SM reported that the final Dining Study is not yet completed.b.Historical Resources Inventory (1.02): The EDPA is in process for the firm selected to perform the Historical Resources Inventory. F&H will move forward with the 1993 study and state clearly that the DPP is based on this version.c.Utility Survey (1.03): RR reported that the Geovision survey missed some water lines because it did not pick up non-metallic lines.

Also, adjacency diagrams showing programmatic relationships between spaces were presented.2.Naming Conventions:Names for the buildings and spaces contained in the project were agreed upon. All names were accepted as presented, with the exception of Barn Annex, which will be referred to as \"Barn Stable\" and Barn Annex Terrace, which will be referred to as \"Barn Stable Patio\" from here on out. The project will include the following buildings: Barn Dining, Kitchen Addition, Cottage, Barn Stable, KUCR, Barn Theater, and Restrooms. Outdoor spaces will include West Courtyard, East Courtyard, and Barn Stable Patio. F&H / LLCGCGF&HF&HF&HF&H3.Barn Dining: F&H reported changes in the design made since WS#2, including the reduced square footage of the Kitchen and the Barn Dining stage.a.Indoor Seatingi.Existing canted beams create difficulties for seating layouts and placement of the POS stations. A section sketch of Barn Dining will be developed to study interior layout options. F&H presented a layout with the sloping columns incorporated into fixed tables to mitigate ADA issues. Bar tables serving a similar function will be studied as a seating option around the perimeter of the Dining Area to preserve view of stage.F&H and LL to study orienting the seating North-South and in an angled configuration.ii.Cheryl Garner (CG) was concerned about seat utilization with bench-style seating. CG recommended 2-tops and 4-tops tables. CG to provide party size and current seat utilization statistics to F&H.iii.Barn Dining may need an A/V mixing booth for existing sound system. CG to provide F&H information regarding current mix setup, which may be applicable to the sound system in the West Courtyard as well.b.General Program Discussioni.F&H to study relocating the Kitchen Mechanical room to the southwest corner of Kitchen for easier connection to steam and chilled water to the east at Vault 15.ii.F&H to study relocating the Green Room to the northwest of Barn Dining, adjacent to Stage.iii.F&H to revise the adjacency diagrams to reflect current program relationships.iv.F&H to study adding a structural bay at the north end of the Dining Area and recreating the existing fa\u00e7ade.Andy Plumley (AP) noted that the original north fa\u00e7ade burned in a fire and the current fa\u00e7ade dates to 1986.APPENDIX Workshop 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #3, 03/19/10 04/08/10 Page 3 of 8F&HF&HF&HF&HF&H4.Cottage: F&H reported changes in the design made since WS#2, including moving the Cottage to the north to clear existing utilities and manholes.a.Entry / Access: There were several concerns about access to the Cottage and the perceived \"front door\" (South Porch) and \"back door\" (East Courtyard) relationship.i.F&H to study the indoor/outdoor circulation and number and location of doors to make the South Porch entry more prominent. Double doors will be considered.ii.F&H to study widening the ramp at the South Porch to address ADA concerns.iii.F&H to study adding a ramp at the North Porch to address ADA concerns at this exit.b.General Program Discussioni.No seating is to be provided inside the Cottage in order to provide sufficient space for circulation and queuing.ii.Office and Telecommunications/Electrical seem too large for the space.F&H to study a Telecommunications/Electrical cabinet that opens up into Office, rather than a dedicated room.iii.Storage is too small. F&H to study shifting square footage to Storage from Office and Telecommunications/Electrical. F&HF&HF&HF&HF&H5.Barn Stable: F&H reported refinements in the design made since WS#2, including the Meeting room seating capacity of 42 persons (using 6-tops tables).The Barn Stable Patio can serve as a spillover seating area if additional seating is needed.a.Meeting / Bari.The two small storage closets at the south end of the Meeting space are not needed. F&H to study the possibility of additional seating in this area.ii.Bar does not need to wrap-around or provide seating. F&H to study a linear walk-up bar with direct access to the Kitchen, shutters, and storage for liquor and bar supplies.iii.Barn Stable will use china, not disposable dishware.b.Electrical / Storagei.F&H to study location of Electrical room to provide access from the outside. c.Lobbyi.Lobby should provide a space for gathering, coat check/closet, space to leave gifts, some kind of furniture (benches), and an entry piece (wedding announcement, etc.)ii.F&H to review Lobby flow and layout.d.General Program Discussioni.F&H to update adjacency diagram to reflect current program relationships, including adding the Barn Stable Patio and showing connection between Restrooms and Lobby.APPENDIX Workshop 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #3, 03/19/10 JHF&H refinements in the design made since WS#2, including the relocation of the radio tower.a.General Program Discussioni.F&H to first and foremost pursue a single-story option for a more efficient net-to-gross ratio. If a second story is necessary, F&H to study the possibility of removing the second stair.One benefit of the two-story design is that it would help to block freeway noise. Consideration should be given to sloping the roof up to the west to help mitigate freeway noise.ii.The Conference Room will be removed from the program. KUCR staff meetings can occur elsewhere in the Barn complex or around campus.iii.Jon Harvey (JH) noted that the library is an area that could be reduced.iv.JH to provide F&H with the detailed KUCR archive shelving analysis that he recently prepared.v.F&H to compare compact shelving to standard shelving and determine square footage savings.vi.F&H to study location of KUCR Remote Live Equipment Room to minimize distance away from loading area.vii.F&H presented an alternate site plan that preserved the walnut tree west of KUCR. The Steering Committee determined that the tree would interfere with access to the service drive and greatly compromise the KUCR floor plan and therefore should not be preserved. Nita Bullock (NB) also noted that the walnut tree located to the west of KUCR is not identified in the UCR LRDP nor listed in any historic registries and should be identified and mitigated through CEQA if determined to be of importance.viii.Louis Vandenberg (LV)is concerned about the security of the archive collection and would like to keep archive materials out of the Production spaces. An alternate suggestion was discussed in which a portion of the archive is displayed in the Production spaces while being properly secured (behind glass, possibly). KB suggested that valuable portions of the KUCR collection might be relocated to special collections in the UCR Library.ix. LV approved the location of the KUCR radio tower at the south end of the building. Master Control should be located as close as possible to the tower to minimize the amount of cable run required (critical adjacency).b.Master Control / Productioni.The possibility of placing the tower on the roof of KUCR will be reviewed during Schematic Design.ii.An Interview / Talent room will need to be added into the program. This space will need to be adjacent to Master Control, with clear visual connection and acoustical separation between the two rooms.iii.A separate Studio Production room is needed. F&H to study if two studios adjacent to Master Control can be provided.iv.JH to follow up with LV to provide F&H information about the number of occupants and equipment Master Control needs to accommodate.v.LV mentioned Master Control at KPFK station as a good precedent.7.Shared Outdoor 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #3, 03/19/10 04/08/10 Page 5 of 8F&HAPF&HF&HF&HF&H to add BBQ and support in drawings, to be located along the southern end of West Courtyard, in the recess formed by the Kitchen Addition.West Courtyard will host various types of performances. AP to provide F&H with lists of current performance types and frequencies, along with potential new uses and priorities.LV expressed concerns about the acoustical ability to host loud performances in an outdoor space/venue.Stage and stepped performance pit are too large and should be downsized. F&H to coordinate with Theater Consultant and revise layout.F&H to add an A/V mixing booth, centered on the stage and located near seating area. The booth should be permanent to limit the amount of equipment than needs to be moved for a show..ii.Outdoor SeatingF&H to revise drawings to show more outdoor seating at the West Courtyard than the East Courtyard (CG noted that this area will become premium seating during performances) with the goal of doubling the amount of West Courtyard seating as compared to the current design. One benefit of an enlarged area will be to allow for additional room for circulation.Upper deck will be fixed seating for dining.Lower levels will have movable furniture (cocktail tables possibly) and provide standing room during performances. Currently, furniture is moved 2-3 times per week in the Barn.8.Security: F&H presented a diagram of both proposed and optional security gates and fences.a.All proposed security enclosures were approved. These include gates at the north end of the West Courtyard running from KUCR to the Barn Theater, gates at the west end of the West Courtyard running from the KitchenAddition to KUCR, gates at the east end of the West Courtyard running from Barn Dining to Barn Theater, enclosure at the Barn Stable Patio, and enclosure at the east end of the East Courtyard.b.Additional security will be needed in the form of gates at the trellis along the north end of East Courtyard.c.The enclosure at the Barn Stable Patio will be a low wall with fencing, vines, and access via gates.9.Moving \"Stuff\": F&H presented a diagram illustrating how materials, trash and dishes will be transported around the site.a.Outdoor bussing stations in the East Courtyard should move to the east end of the courtyard, near the gates that exit out to the Barn Walk.b.The compactor will be used for compost (food waste, green waste, compostable dishware, etc.); additional bins for recycling and trash will also be provided.c.Carts will be used to move items to and from the Barn Stable.APPENDIX Workshop #3: 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #3, 03/19/10 04/08/10 Page 6 of 8F&HF&H/OLI10.Truck Turning: F&H presented a diagram illustrating how trucks will access and exit the Loading Dock area at the Kitchen Addition and Sproul Hall.a.Richard Racicot (RR) noted that trucks accessing the Kitchen Loading Dock do not need to back up; they can simply pull up into the drive and unload. F&H to study if there is clearance for a car to access KUCR parking when a truck is unloading at the Kitchen Addition loading dock area.b.RR suggested the entire Kitchen trash, recycling, and waste oil area be enclosed, with a rolling door.c.The Sproul Loading Dock was reviewed in relation to the Barn Project. The truck turn around in this area is not a necessary element of the Barn Project. F&H and Oppenheim Lewis (OLI) to include two options in the Draft DPP (site plan and Cost Plan) for further review.i.One option with truck turnaround (as shown).ii.One option that merely replaces parking, screens trash pickup, and requires the garbage trucks to back out as they do currently. F&H/OLIF&H/LL11.Utility Points of Connectiona.Steam and Chilled Wateri.The proposed vault (Vault 15) for connecting to the steam and chilled water lines is 300 feet East of site.It is very expensive to extend the line this distance.It may be cheaper to place a stand-alone HVAC unit at each building or to provide a single stand-alone chiller and boiler that feeds the entire site. However, more efficient units needed to achieve LEED Silver will add to the cost.Another benefit of connecting to the steam and chilled water system would be the need for only one mechanical room to support the entire Barn complex.F&H and OLI to study both options (stand-alone HVAC units or connecting to the steam and chilled water system) as part of Cost Plan.b.Electricali.Vault 3A will feed electricity to a transformer south of the Kitchen, then distribute to rest of site.c.Wateri.LL noted that grease interceptors will be needed at both the Barn Stable and Kitchen Addition. F&H / LL to study. F&H12.Phasing: F&H presented two strategies for implementation and phasing of the project. The first phasing strategy maintained the phasing approach described in the RFP. The second, preferred option involves underground utility work and building the Dining facilities in Phase 1, KUCR in Phase 2, and the Barn Theater in a future Phase 3.a.General Commentsi.F&H to revise diagrams to show what is changing at the current phase (along with existing buildings) with future buildings dashed. ii.Underground utility work will need to occur at the beginning of Phase 1, with consideration of maintaining set utilities serving buildings that continue to be in operation during construction.iii.Occupancy dates remain fixed; Phase 1 work will be completed and APPENDIX Workshop 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #3, 03/19/10 04/08/10 Page 7 of 8occupied September 1, 2012 and Phase 2 work will be completed and occupied September 1, 2013.To meet these deadlines, construction should finish at the end of July. If construction is to run over the expected dates, it would be preferable for construction to slip into the Spring rather than the Fall quarter.iv.Parking Lot 4 may be used for contractor staging, cargo, trailer, etc, and the use will need to be confirmed with TAPS during design. b.Phasing Concernsi.KUCR can move to Phase 2 since the schedule has been delayed for Dundee Residence Hall, which necessitates the demolition of the existing KUCR facility.ii.CG will need three weeks to complete training within the Dining facilities.iii.Beginning construction in June is negotiable; if necessary, pushing into spring is preferred to pushing into fall.iv.The Cottage should be constructed concurrently with Barn Dining over summer so that access to the Barn is not infringed upon during the winter and spring.CG noted that if Barn Dining begins to slip, the Cottage should not slip. If Barn Dining is unable to generate revenue for a period of time, Cottage should be up and running by the end of August.v.AP confirmed that leaving the University Club without a meeting space for a period of time is acceptable (within Phase 1, the construction schedule of the Barn Stable has flexibility).c.Phasing Consensusi.Phase 11A: All underground utility work and moving Barn Stable1B: Barn Kitchen1C: Barn Dining and Cottageii.Phase 2: KUCR, West Courtyard, and Stageiii.Phase 3: Barn Theater F&H/TMF&H/TDEF&H/LAOLI13.Consultant Narratives: F&H presented briefs from narratives compiled by the consultants.a.Feedbacki.StructuralRR suggested concrete masonry units for Restrooms and KUCR (for sound purposes) and steel studs for Kitchen.RR suggested that rafter tails be kept, pulling the ridge up for airflow. F&H noted that Tipping Mar (TM), Structural Engineer, had advised against this strategy. F&H/TM to study options for adding insulation above the existing roof framing.ii.MEPF&H and Timmons Design Engineers (TDE) to study options for radiant heating and cooling at the Barn. F&H and Lutsko Assoicates (LA) to address site lighting in the Draft DPP.CG would like to have an emergency generator in place for Barn and Kitchen to support the community in case of emergency. Oppenheim Lewis, Inc. (OLI), cost estimator, to cost.APPENDIX Workshop 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #3, 03/19/10 04/08/10 Page 8 of 8As discussed in WS#2, all buildings will be metered separately.iii.FoodserviceRR noted that all Kitchen walls are to have concrete curbs; he also recommended FRP on cementitious board.JHF&H/OLI14.LEEDa.KB noted that Kenyon Potter is updating UCR LEED baseline. JH to provide F&H with this document for preparing the LEED Matrix. b.Don Caskey (DC) suggested organizing a LEED workshop.i.Begin with UCR baseline and add low-hanging fruit.ii.Educational potential of the project is great. Look at all sustainable options as if project were going beyond LEED Silver. Best to shoot for all options and then scale back as needed.iii.F&H and OLI to develop criteria for a project that meets LEED Silver for the DPP and Cost Plan. APJHAP15.CHASS: During a break, there was a side meeting with CHASS representatives Nathaniel Jones (NJ) and Paul Richardson (PR). AP, JH, JW, and Laura Boutelle (LB) were also in attendance.a.NJ presented a list of issues that were not addressed in the 2009 BAS which will be added to the Appendix of the DPP.b.AP will present the Draft DPP plan to chairs of the department (3) and Dave Keltstrand (sp?) for input. However, the project schedule cannot be delayed when setting this meeting date. If necessary, input will be added as an attachment to the completed DPP.c.JH to invite CHASS and representatives to the conference call with the Theater and AV consultants (4/5/10).d.AP to collect types of performances by CHASS that the Outdoor Spaces and stages will need to support.F&H/OLI16.Cost Plan: F&H and OLI to develop the draft Cost Plan using the format of the two sample Cost Plans provided by JH.a.\"Below the Line\" items:i.Sproul truck turning (this is a campus issue, not specific to this project).ii.Barn Dining/Kitchen emergency generator.b.Escalation will be 2-3% carried to the mid-point of construction.c.A design contingency of 10% or higher will be used in the estimate. CM will be assumed at 5%.d.Each individual building will be broken out, as well as site landscaping per zone.e.The Barn Theater will not be part of the Cost Plan.APPENDIX Workshop #3: 1 & 2 -Action Item Status Table 4//10 Page 1 of 6ISSUED: April 8 , 2010 ACTION ITEM STATUS TABLE PROJECT: DPP - UCR Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 The Action Item Status Table is meant to summarize the action items raised at the meeting(s) listed above and responsible party for each action item .

The agenda for the April 6 thmeeting of the Design Review Board (DRB) included : a.Barn Project Phases 1 & 2, Pre -Design . Fernau & Hartman presented their pre -design study of the Barn Project Phases 1 & 2 which includes: Barn Dining and Kitchen Addition, Barn Stable, Cottage, KUCR and Barn Theatre.APPENDIX ons & 2, Pre -Design . a.The DRB provided the following comments: 1.Encouraged the design development of interior spaces in the Barn Dining area to address acoustics in order to minimize sound transfer. Acoust ical improvements over the existing facility will help improve the dining experience. 2.Recommended that meeting rooms with food service be included in the scope of the project. 3.The t erminus of Eucalyptus and Barn Walks ending in a semi -intersection needs to be addressed in order to provide a more gracious entry into and connection across the campus. This area should be further studied and resolved during design . 4.If security and fencing of the courtyards areas are necessary, it is suggested they be devel oped in a seamless way by using transparent materials for fencing with heights kept to a minimum. 5.The freeway 's noise generation is only partially mitigated by the existi ng sound wall. It will be im portant tostudy how to minimize traffic noise in the co urtyard spaces and how to utilize the building masses as appropriate sound walls . 6.Since the project includes old versus new buildings, the design should be balanced in scale and materials. DRB endorsed the concept of older buildings being in the foregrou nd with the new buildings in the background. Material selection should reinforce the concept so new buildings do not overshadow existing. 7.The incorporation of trellises in the design need sto be in harmony with the building s. 8.KUCR facility should explore a stronger relationship with the outdoor entertainment space .It was suggested that one way would be to incorporate the use of a multipurpose digital screen on the stage area showing broadcasts . 9.The design of potentially five courtyards plays an imp ortant role in the development of the site and should be looked at as a series of interrelated courtyards . 10.The l andscape design should take into consideration the campuses agricultural heritage by developing landsca peresponses that relate to our early Ca lifornia gardens. This could be done not only with plant material, but hardscape, walls and fences. Permeable paving, such as decomposed granite would also evoke this character . This type of approach would make it a rich site and further tie the old APPENDIX DBR /#;\u0002\u0014\u001a\u000e\u0002\u0014\u0012\u0013\u00123tothe new. It was further suggested the approach to the landscape design be developed in a \"less formal\" way than typical campus landscapes . 11.The bathroom facility ,sited at the entry portal to the north ,would be a challenge to design .Sound attenuation and privacy will be concerns. A double -door entry could be considered as well as a water feature in near proximit y to the facility. 12.Campus guidelines should be developed fo rThe Barn Group to ensure that the development of future phases is in keeping wit h the current project's direction . 13.The west side of T he Barn Group needs to be carefully designed, not overlooked or just dealt with in terms of a demanding service function. The concept design for the service road separated from West Campus Drive with a median gives the potential for landscape screening as one , possibly important tool , for the overall design of that face of the project. Theboard commended Fernau & Hartman on a well -developed and refined presentation. Note: Presentation by Fernau & Ha rtman, available by request. 3.0School of Medicine Site Change a.Nita Bullock informed the DRB that the School of Medicine site has changed from the northeast corner of Chicago Ave. and Martin Luther King Blvd., to the northeast corner of Iowa Ave. and Martin Luther King Blvd. The site change will delay the LRDP Amendment process by one year. Nita will provide updates on the status of the LRDP Amendment at future meetings. 4.0Follow Up and Next Steps . a.DRB's ne xt meeting is scheduled for May 3, 2009.

APPENDIX 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #4, 04/16/10 05/20/10 Page 2 of 71.Drawings Presented:Two 24\"x36\" boards(Composite Site Organization Plan and Outdoor Seating Plan). The draft DPP and illustrations from previous workshops were presented digitally.2.Naming Conventions:A clarification was made regarding the name of The Barn. Rather than being divided into two separate spaces and referred to as Barn Diningand Kitchen Addition individually, the building should be referred to as a whole, The Barn, which contains both the Kitchen Addition and Barn Dining.The project will include the following buildings: The Barn, Cottage, Barn Stable, KUCR, Barn Theater, and Restrooms. Outdoor spaces will include West Courtyard, East Courtyard, and Barn Stable Patio.F&HF&HF&H3.Cottage: F&H presented an overview of the program for the Cottage.a.General Program Discussioni.F&H to study frontage seating south of the Cottage as a place for visitors \"to see and be seen.\"ii.F&H to combine the Storage and Telecom/Electrical closet into one space. A secure office space is needed to support cash counting and other administrative functions, but overall the square footage may be reduced to accommodate a larger storage/Telecom space. iii.Telecom/Electrical was noted as being smaller than suggested by the Communication Services. It was agreed that the size of Telecom/Electrical will be reviewed during design.b.Outdoor Seating:F&H to add a column for Programmable Covered Outdoor Space to the \"Summary\" page of the Project Area Summary. F&HF&HF&H4.The Barn: F&H presented an overview of the program for The Barn.a.General Program Discussioni.The current conceptual layout functions well and seating feels comfortable.ii.F&H clarified the function of the three proposed ventilation/light shafts at the indoor dining area. They will bring light into the space and help to move air via the stack effect. A roof monitor at the Kitchen will also help to bring daylight into the Kitchen work area.iii.F&H to include the missing double exterior door at the west side of Barn Dining.b.Performance Areai.F&H will revise the Green Room to be at ground level (on grade with indoor dining), rather than at the level of the stage. The room will have a door exiting into the Barn (to the south) and an exterior door.ii.F&H to confirm height of existing stage.5.Barn Stable: F&H presented an overview of the program for the Barn Stable.a.General Program Discussioni.Barn Stable seating (868 SF indoor at the Meeting Room providing 42 seats and 875 SF outdoor at the Barn Stable Patio providing 44 seats) was found to be acceptable. Seat numbers were based on 20 SF/seat. Cheryl Garner (CG) noted that these seating numbers will satisfy the University Club.ii.The large, sliding barn door proposed for the west wall of the Meeting Room APPENDIX Workshop #4: 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #4, 04/16/10 05/20/10 Page 3 of 7allows the Patio to become an extension of the interior space, with service and guests flowing freely between the two spaces.iii.The shower, included in one of the restrooms, will help achieve the LEED credit SS 4.2 \"Alternative Transportation: Bicycle Storage and Changing Rooms.\" F&H6.KUCR: F&H presented an overview of the program for KUCR, including the new single story plan.a.General Program Discussioni.As requested, two studio production rooms have been provided.ii.It may be possible to reduce the square footage of the Library, however this issue will require further study during the design phase.iii.F&H to study an informal conference area at the wide hallway near the two Edit/Post-Production Rooms. F&HF&H F&H7.Shared Outdoor Spaces: F&H presented an overview of the program for the outdoor spaces, including seat count.a.Seatingi.Dining seating areas (indoor at the Barn and outdoor at the East Courtyard and West Courtyard), total 6,695 SF, allowing for 332 seats (based on approximately 20 SF/seat). The seat count was found to be acceptable. b.West Courtyardi.F&H to note in the narrative the option of moving Sound/Lighting control to the back edge of seating in the West Courtyard will be studied further during design. ii.F&H to revise the Outdoor BBQ layout and criteria. It will be a self-contained unit with a BBQ grill, exhaust hood, refrigerator, sink, and POS. The Outdoor BBQ will not be covered by a roof, however a chimney above the cooking area will be need to direct smoke out of the courtyard. Its location along the south edge of the West Courtyard is acceptable, but it does not necessarily need to be attached to the north wall of the Kitchen Addition.iii.F&H to revise the site plan to show the Outdoor Condiment Counter and Queuing adjacent to the Outdoor BBQ and Bar.8.Materials: The concept presented by F&H for the use of materials to highlight the hierarchy of the existing, new and tertiary structures was found to be acceptable.a.Existing: Materials at the existing buildings will be consistent with the heritage of these buildings.b.New: The new buildings will employ contrasting materials that allow the structures to recede, maintaining the historic structures as the focal point.c.Tertiary: The tertiary structures will be largely landscape type structures that use materials and plantings to knit together the existing and new buildings.F&H9.Site Circulationa.Landscape Approach: F&H presented a sketch by Lutsko Associates (Landscape Architect) for the intersection of the Eucalyptus Walk, the Barn Walk and West Campus Drive. i.F&H will incorporate the landscape sketch of southeast corner on a larger APPENDIX Workshop #4: 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #4, 04/16/10 05/20/10 Page 4 of 7F&HNBsite plan to better illustrate the surrounding context.b.Vehicle Accessi.The drive aisle near the Barn Loading Dock allows approximately 10 feet of clearance for a car to pass while a truck is unloading.ii.Sproul Loading Dock: A simplified Sproul Loading Dock layout without atruck turnaround was accepted. F&H to revise the wall at the north end of the Sproul Loading Dock to allow for fire truck through access.The accepted scheme provides a reconfigured area for service cart storage (4 spaces for media services and 2 spaces for service vehicles) and a location for trash and recycling bins. Access will be limited to service vehicles (no public).Nita Bullock to confirm that an ADA space is not required if these service spaces are considered \"cart storage\" rather than \"parking.\" NB OLISM/CGJH10.Systemsa.Steam and Chilled Water:There are times when the campus steam and chilled water system is shut down. i.Housing to confirm with Physical Plant (between DPP and design) the timing for when steam and chilled water are shut down.ii.Critical services that need to be maintained at the Kitchen Addition are refrigeration and domestic hot water. b.Heating / Coolingi.Radiant system proposed for Barn Stable Lobby and KUCR.ii.Forced air system proposed for Barn Kitchen and Cottage.iii.Radiant systems are preferred for the Barn Stable and Barn Dining, However this system will be studied during design for its ability to respond to quick changes for heating and cooling loads. Forced air in these spaces would be the alternative.c.Electricali.Site Lighting: NB to check with Physical Plant to see if (and how many) existing campus streetlights would be available to incorporate into the project.ii.Barn Kitchen and KUCR require backup power from a shared diesel-powered generator. An acoustical cover will not be needed. Location and size of generator to be determined during design.d.Securityi.UCR Physical Plant to provide infrastructure for security systems (up to points of access), Barn project to carry systems across site and provide all required devices.ii.OLI to include wiring for all systems (assume none will be wireless).iii.Susan Marshburn (SM) and CG to provide electronic door access (card swipe) count and camera count.e.A/V and Internet Accessi.Speakers at Barn Dining, Cottage, and Barn Stable Meeting Room.ii.An empty conduit will be provided at the Lighting/Sound booth for running coaxial cable to and from KUCR.iii.Wireless internet access to be provided across entire site. JH to confirm who provides wireless nodes.APPENDIX Workshop 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #4, 04/16/10 05/20/10 Page 5 of 7OLI11.LEED: F&H presented a assessment of the project LEED checklist. a.LEED Certification Level: While LEED Silver Certification is required by UCR for The Barn Project,LEED Gold is the current target. This level of certification is largely dependent on connection to the campus steam and chilled water system. b.Enhanced Commissioning: OLI will add Enhanced Commissioning to the Cost Plan as a\"below the line\" item. F&H12.Phasing and Implementationc.Phase 1i.Initial work in Phase 1 will include items identified as having potential schedule complications or other risks. These include: moving the Barn Stable and the utility work. Ideally this work would begin before Summer 2011.ii.Phase 1APhase 1A will include: the Kitchen Addition, the Cottage, the Loading Dock Area, and the Drive Aisle along West Campus Drive. The Kitchen Addition should be up and running before the end of summer. Maintaining a functioning kitchen is critical during the school year. The Kitchen Addition will require at least a 12-month window for completion.Demolition of the current University Club meeting space can occur in Phase 1A.iii.Phase 1BPhase 1B will include: Barn Dining, the East Courtyard, and the Restrooms east of The Barn.During the school year when Barn Dining is under construction, the Barn Stable, Cottage, and related seating areas can be used for dining and be served by the Kitchen Addition.d.Phase 2i.Phase 2 will include: the West Courtyard, Stage, and KUCR.ii.The construction fence at the west side of The Barn will be close to along the west side of the building, allowing for exiting only. No West Courtyard seating will be provided during Phase 2.This approach will provide a clean division between Phases 1 and 2.It was agreed that construction activities would be too disruptive to outdoor dining at the West Courtyard.e.Preliminary Schedulingi.F&H to develop a preliminary design and construction schedule.ii.Construction to begin sometime between spring and early summer of 2011.iii.Construction Scheduling will be clarified once design begins and there is a better understanding of project engineering. A Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) will be hired early in the design phase to help facilitate construction scheduling and implementation.iv.Construction noise will need to be carefully managed during dining hours. Halting construction during the lunch hours, however, will have a significant impact on costs.v.During Phase 2, due to the construction of the West Courtyard, there will be a significant lack of outdoor seating. Overflow seating may be provided at the Barn Stable, Barn Stable Patio, and/or frontage seating to the south of the Cottage.APPENDIX Workshop 2 -Meeting Notes from Workshop #4, 04/16/10 05/20/10 Page 6 of 7OLIOLIOLI13.Cost Plan: Scott Lewis (of OLI) presented the cost plan, including assumptions.a.General Elementsi.Site work directly associated with each building was included with that building.ii.Utilities connections associated with each building were included with that building. (Note: the majority of the utility work will occur in Phase 1)iii.Phases run without a break between.iv.Preparation of the ground surface for the Phase 2 staging area will be completed during Phase 1.v.OLI to revise the Cost Plan so that the 10% design contingency is expressed as a line item and not rolled into the estimate. vi.Estimates were obtained from local contractors for the relocation of the Cottage and the Barn Stable.The estimates were considered very low, and so a multiplier was applied to ensure the item is sufficiently covered in the Cost Plan.vii.OLI to add a line item for HAZMAT work by owner, per the HAZMAT report dated February 19, 2010.viii.Chillers, boilers, etc. are not included in Mechanical rooms.

Main areas of concerns: -Adequate lighting in and around the structures that is pedestrian friendly and mitiga tes dark areas that could provide hiding places for the criminal element. -Low ly ing landscaping that eliminates hiding places and keeps an open line of sight between the facilities and parking areas. Security /Surveillance Cameras There is a need for a se curity camera sy stem that is consistent with current campus sy stems. -Coverage of at least the cashier, box office, and alcohol service and consumption areas. -Internet IP address accessibility with pan/tilt/zoom control for UCPD Communications to access i n the event of a police response (UCPD will not monitor the sy stem on a routine basis) . -DVR storage of video footage consistent with current campus time frame standards. Burglary /Panic Alarms At a minimum, there should be an entry and motion detector al arm for the main buildings, including KUCR. Panic alarms should be installed at the cashier , and box office , and KUCR main desk and DJ areas . Access Control Permanent fencing is needed around the alcohol consumption area to prevent patrons from passing a lcoholic beverages through to people outside of the area. Some ty pe of fencing or barricade is needed around the KUCR radio tower to prevent people from climbing and/or tampering with the tower.APPENDIX requirements bytheloading dock. Thanks Jon From: Mike Delo Parking Jon, TAPS and Student Affairs have agreed totransition disabled student transport service toTAPS effective July 1.So, itislikely that Student Special Services willnotretain itstransport vehicles that now park intheSproul Hall service area. That demand forthetwoparking spaces intheSproul Hall loading dock willgoaway. Maybe thisfactor willincrease Mike, Atlastweek's Barn Project Phase 1&2,workshop, parking attheSproul Hall loading dock was discussed. Student Special Services isone group that parking twotransport vans inthearea. Aspart oftheMedical Infrastructure Phase 1project, Student Special Services completed asurvey which describedtheStudent Mobility Services operation. Transport vans areparked atvarious locations through outtheday, andare parked overnight atdedicated spaces across from Sproul Hall loading dock. Student Special Services isopen to finding analternative overnight parking location forthevans perconversation with Marcia Schiffer, Director, Services forStudents with Disabilities Special Services, Request thatyoucontact Marcia Schiffer toidentify another transport vans parking location, which willfree space in theSproul Hall loading dock area. Please letmeknow how long itwilltake toidentify thelocation, andtheproposed implementation clearly identify all of the spaces in KUCT facility.Following suggestions are made after reviewing materials obtained to date.KUCR Program1.An overall station size of 2,800 to 3,000 asf seems fine. Hope that the followingcomments do not necessarily expand the program2.Private Offices: Director, Assistant Director/Program Director, MusicDepartment, and Engineering Department. Suggest an office size of 110 to 120asf per office. This provides a reasonable work space, file storage, and sidechairs. The space allocation can vary by function area (e.g., all offices 110 asfexcept the engineer who would get a larger space for a small work bench).3.Open office: Administrative Assistant, and News/Public Affairs.4.The list of space for either of the above office types can be expanded if spacesare identified.5.Prefer to change name from Kitchenette to Office Service / Kitchenette. Spaceserves multiple functions (e.g., refrigerator, microwave, sink, coffee counter,copy machine, etc).6.Add storage room for Remote Live Equipment. Given the condition of theexisting facility, including a second storage room does not seem reasonable.7.Suggest assigning 48 asf for each Edit/Post/Production Space, and review thesize of the remaining production spaces.8.My impression was the Conference Room would be an actual conference roomthat could also be used for some production work. As presented, the room ismore of a studio. Agree that three studio spaces are needed based upon thetour, with the last being a place that can support a small group of people. Theconference room (10 to 15 stations) replaces the Backstage/Flex Space.9.When was the Green Room added to the program?

This location is less than ideal. It may work but, it is close. The problem is Sproul Hall,blocking, or close-to-blocking, line-of-sight to Box Springs.
