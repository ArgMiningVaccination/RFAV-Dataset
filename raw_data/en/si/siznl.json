We also discussed metabolic disorder associated with antipsychotic drugs. Currently, there are no equivocal evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of herbal drugs in treating metabolic disorders induced by antipsychotic drugs. Therefore, there is a need of extensive research work to be carried out to explore the possibilities of therapeutic intervention of herbal drugs in antipsychotics induced metabolic disorders.
