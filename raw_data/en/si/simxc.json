Finding functional medicine and ayurvedic doctors were the huge missing piece for me to find my truest, most effective healing. When I found Dr. Stephen Cabral, I kind of lost my mind; he's an ayurvedic doctor, a functional medicine doctor, and a naturopath. He blends all three of those in order to heal his patients. Stephen Cabral developed his passion for health & wellness after going through severe health complications at the age of 17. He saw over 50 different doctors, tried over 100 different treatment protocols, but still saw no hope of recovery. It wasn't until he met an \"alternative\" health doctor who explained to him how he got here and how he could become well again, that he began his recovery process. It was at this young age that he knew his life would be dedicated to helping others rebalance their bodies and renew their health. He wrote one of my favorite reads of my entire life (I could not put it down!), [The Rain Barrel Effect](https://www.amazon.com/Rain-Barrel-Effect-Finally-Getting-ebook/dp/B07CF2QVX3). In this episode, we talk through major lessons within the book - especially the way he blends Ayurveda with functional medicine. I am so grateful that he came on this show, to share more and educate us all about the work that he is doing, because it is really powerful, and he is healing so many people.
