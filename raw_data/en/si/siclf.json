This new program falls within an existing program area at MUIH - herbal medicine. This 15-cred it program will be offered online and can be completed in three trimesters . The program is scheduled to begin in the fall 2020 trimester, pending approval by the Maryland Higher Education Commission . A. Centrality to Institutional Mission and Planning Prior ities 1. Provide a description of the program, including each area of concentration (if applicable), and how it relates to the institution's approved mission. The mission of M UIH is: A distinctive community of scholars, researchers, practitioners, and advoc ates, MUIH promotes whole person, relationship -centered healthcare. Through discovery and exploration, we deliver progressive educational programs, advance innovative clinical mo dels, build mutually beneficial partnerships, and provide opportunities for fu lfilling careers. The vision of MUIH is: Serving as a leader in the global transformation of health and wellness, we integrate healing traditions and contemporary science, acknow ledge the wisdom of the body and nature as a teacher, and focus on the interco nnection of mind, body, and spirit. Our work enables people to thrive through the cycles of life. MUIH is a leading academic institution for integrative health. It is an accred ited, private, non -profit university offering the most comprehensive array of graduate -level certificates, master's, and doctoral degrees in integrative health in the nation. MUIH focuses solely on a whole -person, relationship - centered care approach. Since 1974, MUIH has educated and informed practitioners and leaders in health and wellness through programs that draw from traditional wisdom and contemporary science. Graduate programs in acupuncture , Ayur veda, health and wellness coaching, health promotion, herbal medicine, narrative health, nutrition, workplace wellness, and yoga the rapy are offered on -campus and online. As an anchoring academic institution for the emerging complementary and integrative health and wellness system in America, MUIH has an unduplicated fulltime equivalent headcount of 1010 students (2017 -2018 IPEDS repor ting) and has awarded graduate credentials to more than 3,00 0 individuals across the U.S. and internationally. Student interns and professional practitioners provide compassi onate and affordable healthcare through 20,000+ clinical visits annually in the on -campus Natural Care Center, and conventional healthcare and community outreach settings. The on -campus herbal dispensary formulates and compounds herbal preparations for loc al patients and practitioners, and for shipment across the U.S. MUIH conducts rese arch in collaboration with leading national universities. Through scholarly publications and presentations nationally and internationally its faculty are recognized as expert s in their field. MUIH offers a wide range of professional symposia and continuing education, community education, and outreach activities online and on -campus. MUIH alumni across the U.S. and internationally, provide affordable, high impact, and high -qual ity care in 2 private practice, integrative group practices, conventional health car e settings including VA and other hospitals, and mental health, addiction, pain, and rehabilitation centers, and community and corporate settings. The addition of the prop osed program extends MUIH's mission and vision by opening new avenues of academic study and employment in the field of integrative health and herbal medicine . MUIH is one of the few colleges and univer sities in the U.S. that focuses on integrative health and wellness . In addition, v ery few other colleges and universities in the U.S. off er degrees in integrative health and wellness fields and, in particular, in the field of herbal medicine . The proposed online PBC Cannabis Science: Therap eutics, Product Design, and Quality Assurance program expands the options available for academic study in integrative health and herbal medicine nationally . The program educates students about cannabis -based products with an emphasis on health effects, safety, formulation, and quality assurance. It integrates the traditional herbal medicine knowledge and evidence -informed cannabis research needed to develop innovative strategies for commercializing safe and effective cannabis products. Unique to this program, students will investigate ways to combine cannabis with other herbs to optimize health benefits a nd reduce risks. The program provides education in the following areas: f oundational knowledge of the endocannabinoid system , cannabis research to inf orm appropriate therapeutic recommendations and to evaluate and design commercial products , CBD-dominant h emp -based dietary supplements and wellness products and THC -dominant medical and recreational marijuana , optimizing health benefits and reducing risk combining herbal medicine and cannabis , dispensary practices, quality assurance, and industry standards th at support appropriate access to high -quality and safe cannabis -based products . This is a non -experiential program; there are no internships, laborato ries, field work, or hands on work with cannabis as part of this curriculum and program. This program is designed for individuals who wish to support evidence -informed, safe, and responsible use of high -quality cannabis -based products. The program is idea l for those seeking an initial career in the cannabis industry or looking to expand their job options with in the field. The program is also designed for conventional and integrative health practitioners interested in learning about cannabis in order to be informed for their clients. This 15 -credit program will be offered online and can be completed in three trimesters. As is the case with other MUIH programs, the proposed program is designed to serve students with and wi thout a background in science or medicine. Courses are designed to scaffold learning, knowledge, and skills in ways that meet students' prior educational levels in the sciences and herbal medicine . Courses and instruction are also designed to respect and incorporate students' workplace expe riences, and to build upon them and enrich the course for others. The proposed program helps to fill a na tional gap in the graduate educational needs of the expanding legal cannabis industry. To date, only two master's degree s and five graduate certificates in the field exist nationally. None have the same focus as MUIH's proposed pr ogram, which is grounded i n holistic and natural health and wellness, herbal medicine, product design, dispensary practices, and quality assurance and industry standards that support appropriate access to high -quality and safe products. 2. Explain how the p roposed program supports t he institution's strategic goals and provide evidence that affirms it is an institutional priority. 3 The addition of the PBC in Cannabis Science: Therapeutics, Product Design, and Quality Assurance program support s MUIH's strategic go als, values and institutional principles. Since its founding, MUIH has been a pioneer and advocate in the nationa l movement toward wellness, disease pr evention, and patient - and relationship -centered health care. It is helping to lead the transformation of the U.S. healthcare d elivery system through behavioral changes in consumer self -care and the services provided by conventional medical providers and systems , by preparing MUIH graduates to become partners in heal th by educating, facilitating and coaching. The creation of this program supports the University's overarching strategic goals and it's 2019 -2020 strategic priorities : University Strategic Goals Goal 1.O1: Increase awareness, reputation and visibility of the University's academic programs, research initiatives, and clinical offerings. Goal G1.O4: Leverage and adapt current academic program offerings to reach new audiences. Goal G4.O4: Create alternative revenue streams. 2019 -2020 Strategic Priorities Strategic Priority 1: Enhance the student experience Strategic P riority 3: Enhance Integrated Enrollment Management Strategic Priority 4: Enhance a Culture of Continuous Improvement This program complements M UIH's long -standing expertise in herbal medicine. MUIH has offered master's and graduate certificate programs i n herbal medicine since 2002. Its current programs in this field include MS Herbal Product Design and Manufacture, MS Clinical Herbal Medicine, and PBC Herbal Studies. As with all MUIH disciplines , the program model is prevention and education oriented, na ture -based, community -focused, and relationship -centered with an emphasis on establishing rapport with the client and developing a healing presence. Consistent with MUIH's mission to deliver innovative solutions for healthier living and career -oriented opp ortunities for students, the proposed program will continue to advance MUIH's leadership in the emerging wellness system. 3. Provide a brief narrative o f how the proposed program will be adequately funded for at least the first five years of program impleme ntation. (Additional related information is required in section L. Within MUIH's current and foreseen context, l imited new resources specific to this new program are needed to fund and support it through its launch and through the first five years of its implementation . Based on the projected number of enrollments for the program, advising, student success, career services, registrar, student accounts, library, information technology, admissions, and financial aid support can be accommodated within MUIH's current staffing . Instructional needs can be accommodated within MUIH's current faculty complement . Modest program -specific resources are needed to develop and support the program in the form of new online course development ; the five courses of this prog ram are new courses requiring development . Conceptual content for some of these courses exist within MUIH's c urrent physiology, herbal medicine, and herbal product design and manufacture courses and can be dual purposed for the proposed program. The Instru ctional Design 4 Services unit's course development schedule and budget can accommodate the five new course developments that will be needed , given the small number of other new online programs and courses debuting during this time frame. One course developm ent will be needed in fall 2020, two in spring 2021, and two in summer 2021. 4. Provide a description of the institution's commitment to a) ongoing administrative, financial, and technical support of the proposed program , and b) continuation of the program for a period of time sufficient to allow enrolled students to complete the program. This new program will be housed in the existing Nutrition and Herbal Medicine department which supports 554 graduate students annually (453 nutrition, 101 herbal medicine) ; an additional 30 students are projected for the PBC Cannabis Science: Therapeutics, Pro duct Design, and Quality Assurance program during the first year. MUIH has dedicated academic, administrative, faculty, and advising personnel, as well as instructiona l materials and facilities, marketing, recruiting, and additional general student affairs and administrative resources to this department. This is a stable department that currently administers eight programs: Doctor of Clinical Nutrition, MS Nutrition and Integrative Health, MS Clinical Herbal Medicine, MS Herbal Product Design and Manufactur e, PMC Nutrition and Integrative Health, PMC Nutritional Genomics in Clinical Practice, PBC Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition, and PBC Herbal Studies. Dedic ated herbal medicine resources and infrastructure have been included in MUIH's budget on an ongoing basis since academic year 2002 -2003; the existing budget division will continue and support the new program, and it will continue to be included in the Univ ersity's standard annual budget planning process. The program will be overseen and admini stered by its existing Chair, Department Manager, faculty Program Director, and program curriculum committee. The existing dedicated Academic Advisor from Student Affa irs will support students in the current herbal medicine programs and the proposed PBC Ca nnabis Science: Therapeutics, Product Design, and Quality Assurance program. Courses will be staffed by a combination of existing salaried faculty, as well as existing and new adjunct faculty (see Section I for additional details). The new program will be included in the centralized support provided to all programs by the Student Affairs, Library, Information Technology Services, Instructional Design Services, and Facul ty Development units. The impact on these areas is expected to be minimal given the proje cted 30 new students in the first year within MUIH's total enrolled population of approximately 1000 students (an approximate 3% increase in the overall student popula tion). MUIH will use its previously successful enrollment management model to launch the PBC Cannabis Science: Therapeutics, Product Design, and Quality Assurance program ; this model has been successful in growing University enrollments including the cult ivation of new audiences for new program areas . New programs a re allowed a minimum of five years to mature and develop an ongoing prospective student funnel. New student enrollment targets for this program have been set based on the enrollment history of previous new MUIH programs , tracking enrollment trends for similar programs at other universities, and considering MUIH's resources and capacity . MUIH's financial model permit s it to run programs with small cohort enrollments, further supporting sustainabil ity of the program in both its early and later years . Any choice to discontinue a program involves collaborative decision making by the academic department, Dean of Academic Affairs , Provost, Admissions office , Marketing unit, Vice President for Marketing and Enrollment Management, Vice Pres ident for Finance and Administration, and President. Decisions to discontinue a program have been made rarely and have include teach -out plans for enrolled students with extended times to completion given the part time nature of MUIH's programs and the fle xibility needed by its non -traditional student population. 5 B. Critical and Compelling Regional or Statewide Need as Identified in the State Plan 1. Demonstrate demand and need for the program in terms of meeting present a nd future needs of the region and the State . Health Care Health care costs, and expenditures for health care, are on the rise. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has projected that health care spending will rise from $2.9 trillion in 2013 to over $5 trillion in 2022.1 In per centage terms, the total expenditures on health care are projected to rise from 17.8% of GDP in 2015 to 19.9% of GDP in 2025.2 Expenditures for preventive care, a key component of integrative health, are also increasing. T he Federal Reserve Bank of San F rancisco observed that \"spending for preventive treatment increased at an extremely rapid rate over the [2003 to 2007] period. Growth in the percentage of enrollees getting preventive treatment ... drove half this increase. That indicates people are seeking preventive care at an increasing rate.\"3 It is now well established that our nation's health is a social, economic, financial, and behavioral issue of enormous proportions, offering significant opportunities for economic g rowth and employment . The U.S. Departmen t of Labor and the U.S. Bureau of L abor Statistics (BLS) see the health care and social assistance sector as leading job growth. \"Employment of healthcare occupations is projected to grow 14% from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations, adding about 1.9 million new jobs. Healthcare occupations are projected to add more jobs than any of the other occupational groups. This projected growth is mainly due to an aging population, leading to greater demand for healthcare se rvices.\"4 Maryland's Department of Labor also predicts exceptional job growth in the health care of social service sector for the decade 2016 -2026.5 Taken together, these are an indicator of the increasing importance of health -focus ed programs and interventions. The growing costs associated with health care and demands on insurance and treatment systems make prevention and early intervention, strategi es emphasized by integrative health care practices, even more important for employer s. Integrative Health A key component of a successful preventive health program is the use of complementary and integrative therapies. Integrative and complementary health approaches include an array of modalities and products with a history of use or ori gins outside of conventional medicine. 1 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , \"National Hea lth Medicare and Medicaid Services. \"NHE Fact Sheet ,\" Driving Medical -Care Spending Growth? \" Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 2013 . 4 BLS, \"Occupational Outlook Handbook,\" updated January 30, 2018, https:// www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home.htm . 5 Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, \" Maryland Industry Projecti ons - 2016 -2026 - Workforce Information and Performance \", https://www.dllr.state.md.us/lmi/iandoproj/industry.shtml . 6 Medicine's leading accreditor, The Joint Commission6, government's lnter -Agency Task Force on Pain Management7, the C enters for Medicare & Medicaid Services8, and the American College of Physicians9 have recognized the effectiveness of integrative health practices and have recommended their use to manage pain and mitigate the use of pharmacologic approaches , and in part assist in addressing society's opioid crisis. 2019 reports by the Global Wellness Su mmit10 and Forbes11 cite integrative health practices among the top future global wellness trends. A 2013 McKinsey and Company report called the wellness industry \"a demographic sweet spot of enormous potential\" and calculated this market as close to $16.5 b illion per annum.12 Individuals often use integrative health approaches to improve health and wellbeing13 or to relieve symptoms associated with chronic diseases or the side effects of conventional medicine.14 In the U.S., most persons who use complementary h ealth approach es do so to complement conventional care, rather than as a replacement.15 The 2012 National Health Interview Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics demonstrated significant u se and spendi ng on integrative health care approaches.16 One-third of U.S. adults and nearly 12% of children ages 4 to 17 used complementary health approaches. An estimated 59 million persons aged four years and over had at least one expenditure for some ty pe of comple mentary health approach, resulting in total out - 6 J.

Out -of-pocket spending for complementary health approaches represented 9.2% of all out -of-pocket spending on health care. Moreover, spending on integrative me dicine is expected to increase to $115 billion by the year 2015.17 The 2017 National Health Interview Survey revealed an increase in the use of chiropractors from 9.1% in 2012 to 10.3% .18 Additional studies point to the growing use of integrati ve health approaches in health care. Taylor et al. demonstrated in 2018 that 52% of veterans surveys used some type of complementary and integrative health approach.19 A 2010 study conducted by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the A merican Association of Retired Persons indicated that 50% of Americans age 50 and older reported using complementary and alternative medicine.20 In 2018, health and wellness coaching emerged as a $6 billion service market in the U.S., with an estim ated 109 ,000 health coaches and health educators.21 Traditional health care organizations, employers, and regulators are responding to increased consumer demand for integrative health therapies.22 In 2020, t he Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) announc ed that i t would reimburse acupuncture for Medicare recipients .23 A 2019 study by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the National Institutes of Health, and the National Center for Health Statistics, indicated that 53% of office -based physicians , across disciplines, recommended at least one complementary health approach t o their patients during the previous year.24 Massage th erapy was the most commonly recommended approach (30%), followed by chiropractic/osteopathic manipulation (2 7%), herbs/nonvitamin supplements (2 7%), yoga (2 6%), and acupuncture (22%). In 2018, the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) was the first to recognize licensed acupuncturists in the federal government's General Schedule (GS) classification and pay system; acupuncturists are included at the GS -9 to GS12 levels.25 In 2014, the U.S .

This initiative includes acupuncture, biofeedback, clinical hypnosis, guided imagery, massage therapy , meditation, Tai chi / qi gong, and yoga. A 2007 study by McKinsey and Company report found that 41% of patients' choice of hospital is bas ed on their offerings of \"amenities\" that included complementary and alternative therapies.27 A 2007 study by the Bravewell Collaborative indicated that in 1999 only 7.7% of hospitals offered integrative therapies, by 2004 that number had increased to 18.3% , and by 2005 25% of hospitals were offering services in a complementary or integrative fashion.28 A 2010 study b y the Samueli Instit ute and Health Forum, and American Hospital Association Company, indicated that of the responding hospitals (299), 42% state d that they offered one or more complementary and integrative health therapies in the hospital.29 The 2007 Natio nal Home and Hospice Care Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics found that n early 42% of hospice care providers offered complementary and alternative therapies, had a provider on staff or under contract, or both.30 All twenty hospitals on the 2017 -2018 US News and World Report America's Best Hospitals Honor Roll offer integrative h ealth care and practices.31 Membership in the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health grew fr om 36 traditional and allopathic academic medical schools and centers in 2008, to 70 in 2018.32 In addition, allopathic health care providers are p ersonally using integrative therapies at an increased rate.33 The spread of integrative health practices in allopathic settings is also demonstrated through the increase of hospitals and other health care organizations approaching MUIH in the last three to five years seeking inter nship placements for MUIH students. The increase in integrative health approaches has been driven in part by changes in incentive structures for health care providers under the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable C are Act (known as the ACA or Obamacare), the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), and the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016. Briefly, these changes have resulted in awards to health care providers for reducing acute care consumption a nd impose penalties for inefficient, low - quality care. Integrative and allied health professions play a key role in delivering patient outcomes and support the shift in emphasis from acute to preventive care. Integrative health has been shown to . 28 B.

Collectiv ely, these represent some of the fastest growing occupations and areas of health care expansion in the U.S.37 MUIH's programs, including the PBC Cannabis Science: Therapeutics, Product Design, and Quality Assurance program, prepare individuals to provide such integrative health care. Herbal Medicine Consumer use of herbal medicine continues to grow. A 2011 study by the National Center for Health Statisti cs indicated that the use of dietary supplements is common among the U.S. adult population and has been growing significantly.38 Over 40% of adults in the U.S. used supplements in 1988 -1994 and over 50% used them in 2003 -2006. The 2012 National Health Inter view Survey indicated that more than 40 million individuals in the U .S. used non -vitamin, non -mineral supplements in 2012, up from 38 million users in 2007.39 In addition, significant increases in the sales of herbal supplements has been seen in recent year s.40 In 2017, total U.S. retail sales of herbal supplements surpass ed $8 billion for the first time, reaching nearly $8.1 billion. Consumer spending on herbal supplements increased 8.5% from 2016 - the strongest sales growth for herbal supplements in more t han 15 years. Total U.S. retail sales of herbal supplements have i ncreased every year since 2004, and since that time consumer spending on supplements has nearly doubled. Increasingly, these consumers are reaching out to professional clinicians to help the m understand what is safe and effective from the vast array of her bal supplements found in the market. The development of MUIH's MS Herbal Product Design and Manufacture p rogram parallels this growth and helps to support the growing need for health care professionals who have been trained in the use of this modality.

Hemp -derived CBD is now available in general retail channels outside of licensed cannabis dispensaries, including online, dru g stores, natural products, bea uty, convenience, grocery and pet stores. Research firm Brightfield Group projects the U.S. CBD industry will outpace the marijuana market and reach $23.7 billion in sales by 2023.50 BDS Analytics forecasts U.S. CBD sales to reach $20 billion by 2024, acco unting for nearly 44% of the $45 billion total forecasted cannabinoid market .51 Hemp -based cannabis sales of CBD -based supplements grew 332% from 2018 to 2019, with over $52 million in 2019 sales, making hemp -based cannabis sup plements the top selling herb al supplement in the U.S. market.52 Current herbal supplement manufacturers are increasingly embracing CBD based cannabis products. The percent of natural product manufacturers selling such products doubled in the first six mont hs of 2019, with 75% of the industry planning on launching new CBD - based products over the next two years.53 The development of MUIH's PBC Cannabis Science: Therapeutics, Product Design, and Quality Assurance program parallels this growth and helps to supp ort the growing need for health care professionals who have been trained in the use of this modality. 2. Provide evidence that the perceived need is consistent with the Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education . The proposed program will serve the needs of the State of Maryland, consistent with the goals of the Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education for 2 017-2021.54 Give n that this program is a graduate program its focus is on Maryland's Success and Innovation goals, rather than the Access goal which emphasizes the K -12 to postsecondary education pathway. Success: Promote and implement practices and polici es that will en sure student success. Strategy 4: The online format of the program increases accessibility to higher education by residents of Maryland and other states for whom geography and time may be barriers to enroll.

C. Quantifiable and Reliable Evidence and Documentation of Market Supply and Demand in the Region and State . 1. Marke t Demand 13 It is now well established that our nation's health is a social, economic, financial, and behavioral issue of enormous proportions, offering significant opportunities for economic growth and employment . The U.S. Departmen t of Labor and the U.S. Bureau of L abor Statistics (BLS) see the health care and social assistance sector as leading job growth . \"Employment of healthcare occupations is projected to grow 14% from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations, adding about 1.9 mil lion new jobs. Healthcare occupations are projected to add more jobs than any of the other occupational groups. This projected growth is mainly due to an aging population, leading to greater demand for healthcare services. \"55 Maryland's Department of Labor also predicts exceptional job growth in the health care of social service sector for the decade 2016 -2026.56 Taken together, these are an indicator of the increasing importance of health -focused programs and interventions. The growing costs associated with health care and demands on insurance and treatment systems make prevention and early intervention, strategi es emphasized by integrative health care practices, even more important for employers. Herbalists will support the continued projected growth of he althcare occupations in the U.S. Individuals who hold the MS Herbal Product Design and Manufacture degree w ill support the $8 billion herbal supplement industry .57 The MS Herbal Product Design and Manufacture program is designed for individuals with a wide range of interests in the growing herbal supplement industry. Graduates of the program will be poised to c ontribute as change agents for quality, rigor, and efficacy in diverse areas of the herbal product field. The program is ideal for individuals interes ted in herbal product development, formulary, sustainable production, quality control, research, education , retail, marketing, and sales. Individuals with graduate level credentials in herbal medicine are achieving employment. MUIH's Next Destination Surve y of alumni (2018 --2019) indicated that 79% of respondent herbal med icine master's graduate s were employed within one year of graduation. Marijuana Business Daily's 2019 Marijuana Business Factbook estimates the number of full -time workers in the U.S. mar ijuana industry was between 130,000 and 160,000 in 2018, increased to 175,000 to 215,000 in 2019, and will reach 385,000 to 475,000 workers by 2023 .58 BDS Analytics and Arcview estimate as many as 630,000 cannabis jobs by 2025.59 Leafly's Cannabis Job Count report suggests that the cannabis industry is among the largest job creation engines in the U.S (14).60 The career opportunities vary based on the segment of the market (medical vs. recreational vs. hemp - based cannabis). However, all three segments demand s imilar knowledge and skill sets that are basic to the world of herbal supplements.

The online format means that the program can reach those workers throughout Maryland and the n ation. 2. Educational and Training Needs The educational pathways available to support the cannabis industry were analy zed. The proposed PBC Cannabis Science: Therapeutics, Product Design, and Quality Assurance program fills a national gap of opportunities for academic graduate study. Six graduate programs and six undergraduate programs exist at other colleges and universities across the U.S. A number of other colleges and universities offer stand -alone credit bearing courses and non -credit cou rses and cert ificates. In addition, seventeen non -credit corporate training providers have been identified. The currently available academic programs include : Level Institution Program Format Undergr aduate Hocking College (OH) AAS Laboratory Science - Cannabis Lab Technician F2F Minot State Univ (ND) BS Medicinal Plant Chemistry (cannabis concentration) F2F Northern Michigan Univ (MI) BS Medicinal Plant Chemistry (cannabis concentration) F2F Oakton Community College (IL) Certificate - Cannabis Dispensary & Patient Care Specialist F2F Stockton University (NJ) Minor - Cannabis Studies F2F Western Illinois University (IL) Minor - Cannabis -Growing F2F Graduate American International College (MA) MS Cannabis Science and Commerce Hybrid Clark University (MA) Certificate - Regulatory Affairs for Cannabis Control Online Jefferson University (PA) Certificate - Cannabinoid Chemistry and Toxicology Hybrid Certificate - Cannabinoid Pharmacology Online Certificate - Cannabis Medicine Online 61 Cannabis Jobs Database.

Medical Ca nnabis and Therapeutics degree is the first eve r master's degree in cannabis offered in the U.S.; it has a strong focus on the pharmaceutical use of cannabis with chemistry and toxicological analysis. American International College will begin offering a M.S. Cannabis Science and Commerce program in fall 2020. This program focuses on the basic science, business, and legal issues of the cannabis industry. Jefferson University , a graduate medica l and health sciences university , offers three graduate certificat es that focus on chemical analysis, pharmacology and toxicology, and a review of conventional medical therapeutic uses. Pacific College of Health and Science offers a graduate certificate at its California campus that serves the conventional healthcare pro fessional and focuses on the medical uses of cannabis. Clark University's certificate program is the only graduate program in the U.S. to focus on regulatory and policy matters that impact t he cannabis industry. None of these program s have the f ocus on her bal medicine, holistic health and wellness, and safety and quality assurance in product design that MUIH's program has. 3. Prospective Graduates The proposed PBC Cannabis Science: Therapeutics, Product Design, and Quality Assurance program has differentiat ing factors that will support its competitiveness in th e growing integrative health and herbal medicine fields and the cannabis ind ustry : one of on ly a few graduate programs in the cannabis field; the only cannabis program grounded in holistic and natural health and wellness, herbal medicine, product design, dispensary practices, and quality assurance ; its grounding in MUIH's solid reputation and phi losophy; cost; distinctive features of the program experience such as the MUIH's singular and hallmark focus on integrative health, a holistic approach, and a relationship -based and healing presence approach ; and the opportunity to sequentially cross -train in other integrative health fields at MUIH. Given the upward trends in the integrative health field , the enrollment history for new programs at MUIH, and the enrollment trend for cannabis programs at other universities, the following enrollment projections call for modest but solid growth over the first five years. Projected Enrollments for Program* Year Trime ster New Students Continuing Students Total Students per Trimester Total Students per Year Year 1 Fall 2020 30 30 81 Spring 2021 27 27 Summer 2021 24 24 Year 2 Fall 2021 50 50 135 Spring 2022 45 45 16 Summer 2022 40 40 Year 3 Fall 2022 70 70 189 Spring 2023 63 63 Summer 2023 56 56 Year 4 Fall 2023 80 80 216 Spring 2024 72 72 Summer 2024 64 56 Year 5 Fall 2024 80 80 216 Spring 2025 72 72 Summer 2025 56 56 *Enrollment Assumptions: New students are admitted once a year in the fall trimester . The program is designed to be completed in three trimesters. Continuing students have an overall average retention rate of 80%, consistent with that of MUIH's existing pro grams. D. Reasonableness of Program Duplication: One o ther university in Maryland offers a graduate program in the cannabis field. The University of Maryland's School of Pharmacy (UMSOP) offers the M.S. Medical Cannabis and Therapeutics degree, which is the first master's degree in the cannabis to be offered in the U.S. This program and MUIH's program share some similarities while also being distinctly different from one another, as shown in the following charts: Feature UMSOP Program MUIH Program Program Type Master of Science Post -Baccalaureate Certificate Number of Credits 30 15 Instructional Format Hybrid Online Major Areas of Focus Medic al use of cannabis , emphasis on therapeutics, pharmacology, chemistry and toxicolo gy Holistic health and wellness, herbal medicine, and safety and quality assurance in product design Content Similarities Unique to UMSOP Unique to MUIH Program Cannabinoid chemistry and pharmacology Clinical effects of medical cannabis Therapeutics and known side effects Introduction to medical cannabis history and culture Broad view of cannabis laws and policies Focus on principles of drug action, cannabinoid chemistry and drug delivery Overarching focus on herbal medicine Therapeutic focus on both health promotion and disease management Therapeutic strategies that combine cannabis with herbal medicine 17 Research design and medical cannabis.

Relevance to High -demand Programs at Historically Black Institutions (HBIs) There are no graduate programs in the cannabis field offered by Maryland HBIs. The proposed program will have no potential impact on high -demand programs at Maryl and's HBIs or on the uniqueness and institutional identities and missions of the HBIs. F. Relevance to the identity of Historically Black Institutions (HBIs) There are no graduate programs in the cannabis field offered by Maryland HBIs. The proposed progr am will have no potential impact on high -demand programs at Maryland's HBIs or on the uniqueness and institutional identities and missions of the HBIs. G. Adequacy of Curriculum Design, Program Modality, and Related Learning Outcomes 1. Program Development Mo del MUIH uses an ongoing and iterative process to identify and research potential new programs. Potential new programs are routinely identified by faculty , academic and administrative leadership, and external professional collaborators through an ongoing analy sis of trends and career needs in the health care sector and the field of integrative health, and the career pathways and needs of MUIH's students and alumni. Data sources include national and regional career outlook and projection statistics; profess ional credentialing trends and requirements; competitive programs at other colleges and universities; the results of student learning outcomes assessment activities in existing programs; the results of periodic academic program reviews ; and the results of alumni surveys. The Provost's office leads an annual review of potential new programs and selection of new programs for development in collaboration with the academic leadership, department s, and faculty , and with input from the President's Executive Counc il, and the advising, admissions , marketing teams. Faculty are responsible for the development of the program learning outcomes, description, requirements, curriculum, courses, student learning experiences, and program assessment plans , in collaboration with academic administrators . These aspects of the program are then reviewed and approved 18 successively by the department curriculum committee , University Curriculum Committee, Provost, Board of Trustees' Academic Affairs Committee, and Board of Trustees. The herbal medicine program engaged in an analysis of its programs in 2017 -2019 with the goals of ensuring a student -centric design, a quality student learning experience, and workplace relevance and alignment of the curriculum. This analysis was informed by various sources. First, the career readiness and employment status of herbal medicine alumni was assessed through a survey of working herbalists in 2014 , herbal medicine alu mni in 2017 , and herbal medicine alumni one year after graduation in 2018 -2019 . Second, the skills, knowledge, and need for herbalists was assessed through phone interviews with two groups of working herbalists - MUIH alumni and non -alumni identified throu gh the American Herbalist s Guild. Third, the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA) 2018 survey on herbal product and employment trends was reviewed. Fourth, MUIH's Herbal Design Business Advisory Group provided feedback in 2017 -2018 on the previous p rogram curriculum and input on the and new program curriculum with respect to work force needs, skills, and knowledge; this group includes representation from nationally -recognized industry leaders, federal agencies, and trade associations in the herbal pro duct field. Fifth, the academic department and faculty reviewed the previous herba l medicine programs ' curriculum, learning outcomes assessment results, students' clinical placements and professional portfolios, student success and retention rates, program structure, content, and length (credits and time), and enrollment trends . Sixth, throughout 2018 -2019, a cannabis -specific working group analyzed the industry and its educational needs with res pect to an emphasis on herbal medicine , holistic health and wellness, product design, and safety and quality assurance. This collective analysis resulted in a redesign of the herbal medicine master's degrees in 2019 and the PBC Cannabis Science: Therapeutics, Product Design, and Quality Assura nce program proposed here. 2. Program Description and Requirements Program Description The Post -Baccalaure ate Certificate in Cannabis Science: Therapeutics, Product Design, and Quality Assurance educates students about cannabis -based products with an empha sis on health effects, safety, formulation, and quality assurance. The program integrates the traditional herbal medicine knowledge and evidence -informed cannabis research needed to develop innovative strategies for commercializing safe and effective canna bis products. Unique to this program, students will investigate ways to combine cannabis with other herbs to optimize health benefits and reduce risks. This is a non -experiential program. There are no internships, laboratories, field work, or hands on wor k with cannabis as part of this curriculum and program. The program provides education in the following a reas: Foundational knowledge of the endocannabinoid system Cannabis research to inform appropriate therapeutic recommendations and to evaluate and design commercial products CBD -dominant hemp -based dietary supplements and wellness products and THC -dominant medical and recreational marijuana Optimizing health benefits and reducing risk combining herbal medicine and cannabis Dispensary practices, quali ty assurance, and industry standards that support appropriate access to high -quality and safe cannabis -based products 19 The program includes a scientific exploration of two distinct sets of cannabis -based products. The first group is the CBD -dominant hemp -based products that are not psychoactive, are legal in all fifty U.S. states, and are being integrated increas ingly into the dietary supplement industry. The second set of products are medical and recreational THC -dominant cannabis products that are psychoa ctive, regulated more strictly than hemp -based products, and mostly available through a limited number of licensed dispensaries. The program examines the science behind cannabis and explores the evidence for therapeutic benefits and risks, considerations i n product design, and issues of quality assurance for both types of products. With regards to CBD -dominant hemp -based products, students including complementary and integrative health (CIH) practitioners will learn how to assess products on the market an d safely and appropriately recommend those that are well -designed and meet quality control standards. Student s interested in product design or other work in the dietary supplement industry, will learn the principles of formulation and quality assurance for purposes of evaluating existing products and product development. Recommending THC -dominant cannabis produ cts does not fall within the scope of practice for most CIH practitioners; however, many clients are consuming or considering consuming THC -dominan t products. It is important that CIH practitioners be well informed about quality, safety, and effectiveness of THC -dominant cannabis products in order to identify safety concerns as well as refer to other clinicians when appropriate. Students interested i n working in licensed dispensaries will also benefit from this education as it provides them with the tools t o evaluate retail products, build quality control practices into the dispensary workflow, and inform customers about available products in an ethic al and responsible fashion. Like other MUIH programs, this one is designed to serve students with and withou t a background in science or medicine. Courses are designed to scaffold learning, knowledge, and skills in ways that meet students' prior education al levels in the sciences. Courses and instruction are also designed to respect and incorporate students' wor kplace experiences, and to build upon them and enrich the course for others. Program Outcomes Upon completion of this program, graduates will be able to: Explain the endocannabinoid system and its role in the body's response to cannabis and other medicin al plants. Apply foundational knowledge of herbal pharmacology, clinical research, and traditional use to design and evaluate safe and effective c annabis -containing herbal supplements that support health and well -being. Utilize pharmacological and clinica l research on cannabis to inform safe and effective therapeutic choices. Apply an ethical framework, along with regulatory and industry standards, to provide cannabis education and access to high -quality cannabis products in dispensaries and other retail environments. Apply best practices in quality assurance to develop quality control practices and assess cannabis - based products.

Adequacy of Provisions for Evaluation of Program Assessment System: Assessment and evaluation of programs is conducted through a multi -faceted approach . The academic dep artments, programs, and curriculum committees, subject matter experts (SMEs), and faculty responsible for designing, delivering, and assessing learning out comes are the primary drivers of assessment and evaluation of the program. They are supported by the University Curriculum Committee which serves to guide and facilitate academic assessment initiatives . Additional support is provided by the Assistant Provost for Academic Assessment and Accreditation, Dean of Academic Affairs, Provost, and Institutional Assessment Committee in gathering , interpreting , documenting, and using assessment results. 27 Academic Assessment Processes: Student learning o utcomes assessment is governed by each programs' comprehensive Academic Assessment Plan. Such plans include program and course learning outcomes established during the initial development of the program and courses, respectively. These outcomes, the method s and timeline for their assessment , and use of assessment results for program and course improvement are part of th e program's comprehensive assessment plan . The Annual Assessment Reports prepared by each program and the comprehensive five -year Academic P rogram Review process include an analysis of student learning outcomes assessment and how such results have been use d to improve the curriculum and instruction. Academic Assessment Plans, Annual Assessment Reports, and Academic Program Reviews are developed and executed by the faculty in each program, and reviewed by the Provost, Dean of Academic Affairs, and the Instit utional Assessment Committee as a part of in stitutional assessment and planning activities. Course Design: Centralized course des ign and development is guided by the Quality Matters rubric to ensure alignment of the stated course learning outcomes, asses sments, activities, and instructional materials and resources. (Further details on assessment and evaluation in online courses are provided in Appendix D.) Faculty use an institutional master Syllabus Template to prepare their classes each trimester, and t his template includes course learning outcomes and the alignment framework. Student Retention: Student retention rates are calcula ted, monitored, and reported on an ongoing basis using an automated reporting system developed by the IT unit drawing upon co urse completion and student status stored in the Student Information System. This information is reviewed on a regular and periodic basis by the Provost, Dean of Academic Affairs, Associate Provost for Student and Alumni Affairs, Retention Committee, and E nrollment Management Committee. Student Satisfaction: First, t he IDEA Student Rating of Instruction tool and Campus Labs online platform are used by students to evaluate courses and faculty at the end of every trimester . IDEA is a nonprofit organization w hose mission has been to provide assessment and feedback systems to improve learning in higher education. The IDEA tool meets the n eeded and desired criteria for a sustainable course evaluation system that was previously identified by the L earning Outcomes Assessment Team . Further, the IDEA system is based on 26 years of research and allows the institution to compare faculty performance within similar disciplines and among over 400 other universities. Second , the Provost holds program -specific Open Forums f or enrolled students throughout the academic year. The feedback gathered during these sessions is used by the academic departments and faculty to make improvements in curriculum, instruction, and program administration. Third, periodic customer service sur veys are conducted centrally for student -facing units such as the Library, Registrar's office, advising, Career Center, and Student Success Center. Faculty Feedback and Evaluation: Faculty are evaluated annually by their department chair. Salaried faculty are evaluated against the annual teaching, research/scholarship, and service requirements specified in institutional poli cy. Adjunct faculty are evaluated based on teaching activities only. The results of IDEA course evaluations are used as a measure of t eaching effectiveness. A Faculty Peer Review system provides salaried and adjunct faculty with formative and constructive feedback to improve their pedagogy . Faculty satisfaction and needs analysis are assessed through the annual Employee Satisfaction Surv ey and the periodic Faculty Professional Development Survey. 28 Cost-Effectiveness : The revenue -to-expense ratio of each academic program and academic service department is calculated at the end of each trimester. These ratios are reviewed by the President, Vice President for Finance and Administration, Provost, Dean of Academic Affairs, and academic department chairs and used to manage current year academic department budgets and plan for future years' budgets.

Curriculum and In struction (i) A distance education program shall be established and overseen by qualified faculty. MUIH faculty have Master's, doctoral, or professional degrees and academic, clinical, or practical expertise in the content areas of the courses they are assigned to teach. Online and blended programs are established and overseen through a collaborative pr ocess that includes such qualified faculty. Each program is led by an Academic Director or Program Director, who is also a faculty member. Larger programs include faculty positions such as Director of Academic Development and Division Chair, who lead parti cular academic aspects of their programs. Curriculum committees composed of faculty members exist in each academic department to oversee courses and progr ams, including those that involve online and blended delivery methods. A comprehensive program revie w of each program in the University is conducted every five years, involving program faculty and using internal and external experts. The University Curri culum Committee, which includes representation from the Faculty Senate, provides integrated and instit utional oversight of courses and programs, including online or blended offerings. (ii) A program's curriculum shall be coherent, cohesive, and comparabl e in academic rigor to programs offered in traditional instructional formats. MUIH's curricula, regardless of delivery format, are designed in consultation with experts in the field, MUIH's qualified faculty, and external environmental scanning and workf orce needs analyses to ensure coherence, cohesiveness, and academic rigor. The curriculum, learning outcomes, and academic expectations of faculty and students of a program, regardless of the delivery format, are the same and are overseen and approved by t he same program faculty and curriculum committees. They are also overseen by the same University bodies including the University Curriculum Committee, Faculty Senate, Executive Management Committee, and the Board of Trustees. (iii) A program shall resu lt in learning outcomes appropriate to the rigor and breadth of the program. Program learning outcomes are developed based on input from MUIH's qualified faculty and academic leaders, c onsultation with expert professionals in the field, and external envi ronmental scanning and workforce needs analyses. The academic rigor and expectations of programs, regardless of their delivery format, are aligned with the nationally recognized standards specified by the Council of Graduate Schools and the Lumina Foundati on's Degree Qualification Profile (DQP). The content, learning outcomes, rigor, depth, and breadth of programs, regardless of their delivery format, are also aligned with external program -specific accrediting and curriculum -guiding bodies, where available. These include the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME), Council of Chief Academic and Clinical Officers of the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges (AANMC) , Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACA OM), Accreditation Council for Nutrition Professional Education (ACNPE), Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists (BCNS), International Coach ing Federation (ICF), National Consort ium for Credentialing Health and Wellness Coaches (NCCHWC), Certified Health Education Specialist (CHES) 35 examination of the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing (NCHEC), and International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT). (iv) A pro gram shall provide for appropriate real -time or delayed interaction b etween faculty and students. Online and blended courses and programs are delivered using the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS). This platform supports asynchronous interaction between faculty and students through a variety of embedded tools. Facult y and students also have the op portunity for synchronous interaction using the Big Blue Button web conferencing system, which can be directly accessed from the Canvas online classroom. MUIH develops its online and blended courses according to the \"master course philosophy.\" For each online and blended course, a master version is developed, with components and activities designed to foster ongoing engagement between faculty and students. These components include online asynchronous discussion forms and syn chronous lectures, chats, and o ffice hours. Appropriate asynchronous and synchronous interactions between faculty and students are designed and included in online and blended courses as guided by Standard 4 (Instructional Materials) and Standard 5 (Course Activities and Learner Engageme nt) of the Quality Matters Rubric. (v) Faculty members in appropriate disciplines in collaboration with other institutional personnel shall participate in the design of courses offered through a distance education program. MUIH uses a collaborative team approach to develop its online and blended courses. Faculty subject matter experts (SMEs) design, develop and offer online and blended courses appropriate to the mission and objectives of the program. Faculty SMEs are selecte d based on their discipline exp ertise, professional and teaching experience, and their completion of onboarding and training activities for online and blended faculty. Academic and Program Directors, who are also faculty members, lead the course developmen t teams and guide and collabora te with the faculty SMEs. The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) supports the faculty SMEs and academic departments in online and blended course development, and in teaching and assessing the quality of online and blend ed learning. The Center's instr uctional designers, instructional technologists, digital learning specialists, multimedia specialists, and learning management system administrator are collaborative members of the online and blended course development teams. The Center's Assistant Provost provides oversight and guidance for the course development teams, who are also supported by the Assistant Provost for Academic Assessment and Accreditation. The University develops its online and blended courses according t o the \"master course philosophy ,\" developing and maintaining a master version of each online and blended course. The master version contains certain course components as determined by the University's academic leadership, including the learning outcomes, a syllabus, content learning mod ules, reading assignments, key learning objects, and key assessment tools, thus ensuring consistency of delivery of online and blended courses and allowing more precise assessment across various occurrences/sections of online and blended courses. Each instructor of online and blended courses receives a copy of the master course and reviews it to determine whether any edits are necessary. The faculty then make all appropriate edits to the master course, and each instructor supp lements the master course with his/her unique teaching materials, including discussion forums and other activities. 36 2. Role and Mission (i) A distance education program shall be consistent with the institution's mission. MUIH's mission is ... \"A distinctiv e community of scholars, researchers, practitioners, and advocates, Maryland University of Integrative Health promotes whole person, relationship -centered healthcare. Through discovery and exploration, we deliver progressiv e educational programs, advance i nnovative clinical models, build mutually beneficial partnerships, and provide opportunities for fulfilling careers.\" All of MUIH's programs, regardless of their delivery method, are aligned with this mission and emphasize innovative and progressive pract ices and philosophies in the emergent fields of integrative health. While such programs constitute the foundation and core of MUIH's academic offerings, they are unique among other colleges and universities across Marylan d, the Mid -Atlantic region, and t he United States. To ensure consistency with the university's mission, new programs are developed according to a process flowchart that emphasizes cross -functional input at early and frequent decision points, from initial exploration to program launch. In addition to faculty, academic program leadership, the Faculty Senate, and program and university curriculum committees, the Executive Management Committee provides a further level of oversight with respect to institutional mission alignment and the impact and integration of the curriculum with student affairs, admissions, marketing, budget and finance, facilities and technology, and legal and compliance issues. (ii) Review and approval processes shall ensure the appropriate ness of the technology being used to meet a program's objectives. As part of the online and blended course development process, the development team conducts a review of technology needs and potential uses in the course and program. Technologies are sele cted for inclusion based on their ability to support the achievement of the course learning objectives, alignment with the discipline, and the principles of Standard 6 (Course Technology) and Standard 8 (Accessibility and Usability) of the Quality Matters Rubric. All online and blended courses are designed with the support of instructional designers, instructional technologists, digital learning specialists, multimedia specialists, and learning management system administrators. These specialists assist fa culty and the Academic and Progra m Directors in identifying and recommending the most effective learning technologies to facilitate and achieve the course's learning objectives. The Academic and Program Directors and the Assistant Provost of CTL use these recommendations to approve the in clusion of particular technologies in particular online and blended courses. The adoption of new learning technologies across the curriculum is considered by the Academic Leadership Council (ALC) in collaboration with the Director of Information Technolo gy. The ALC is composed of the Provost, all Associate and Assistant Provosts, and all of the Academic and Program Directors, who are faculty members. 3. Faculty Support 37 (i) An institution shall provide for training for faculty who teach with the use of tec hnology in a distance education format, including training in the learning management system and the pedagogy of distance education. Faculty developing and teaching online and blended courses are supported by CTL (The Center for Teaching and Learning), wh ich provides both group and one -on-one support. CTL recognizes the central role of teaching and learning at MUIH and its deep commitment to academic excellence. Its activities and initiatives, designed to enhance studen ts' learning experience and support f aculty teaching excellence in all disciplines and formats, include: fostering quality and innovation in pedagogical approaches, the meaningful use of technology in teaching and learning, the role of assessment in teachi ng and learning, the scholarship of t eaching and learning, and the application of learning science and research. CTL comprises an integrated set of units: the digital learning team of instructional designers, instructional technologists, digital learning specialists, and multimedia speciali sts; the learning management system (LMS) administration team; the faculty onboarding and engagement team; and the faculty professional development team. It is led by an Assistant Provost, who provides oversight for all online and blended course developmen ts and for faculty training and professional development. Before beginning their first online or blended course development or teaching assignment, MUIH requires faculty to complete the Best Practices in Online/Blended training focused on online pedagogy/ andragogy, the Canvas LMS training, Big Blue Button web conferencing training, and one -on-one consultation tailored to their individualized needs, all provided by CTL. These faculty are also provided the Quality Matters Rubric as a guiding resource and acc ess to 24/7 support through the Canvas Help Desk. Faculty developing and teaching online and blended classes also have with ongoing opportunities for professional development through various face -to-face and online webi nars, workshops, trainings, and confe rences. (ii) Principles of best practice for teaching in a distance education format shall be developed and maintained by the faculty. MUIH's principles of best practice for developing and teaching online and blended courses are based on nationally recog nized research -based standards, including those of Quality Matters, the Online Learning Consortium (OLC), EDUCAUSE, WICHE Cooperative for Educational Technologies (WCET), National University Technology Network (NUTN), t he Middle States Commission on Higher Education, and the Council of Regional Accrediting Commissions (C -RAC). Ongoing opportunities for the dissemination of best practices in online and blended course development and teaching are coordinated jointly by CTL and the Faculty Development subcommi ttee of the Faculty Senate.

Commitment to Support (i) Policies for faculty evaluation shall include appropriate consideration of teaching and sch olarly activities related to distance education programs. The criteria for faculty appointment, evaluation, rank, and promotion are the same regardless of the delivery method in which the faculty member teaches . With respect to faculty workload and the nu mber of credits taught annually, online or blended courses are weighted the same as face -to-face instruction. Faculty, including ranked faculty, who teach online or blended courses are eligible and encouraged to participate in scholarly activities, includi ng those related to distance education. (ii) An institution shall demonstrate a commitment to ongoing support, both financial and technical, and to continuation of a program for a period sufficient to enable st udents to complete a degree or certificate. The University's five -year strategic plan includes innovative course and program delivery formats such as online, blended, and digitally -enhanced learning to provide flexible and accessible programs. The univer sity's budget, directly linked to its strateg ic plan and approved annually by the Board of Trustees, outlines all resource requirements (financial, personnel, administrative, support, compliance, and technical) to maintain and grow. As part of its commitme nt to the sustainability of online and blende d teaching and learning, MUIH maintains a rolling annual online and blended course development schedule. It adheres to the nationally recognized Hallmarks of the Excellence in Online Leadership specified by the University Professional and Continuing Educat ion Association (UPCEA) and the Quality Scorecard: Criteria for Excellence in the Administration of Online Programs specified by the Online Learning Consortium (OLC). In the event that the University decides t o cease admitting students for an academic pr ogram, it will ensure that courses continue to be offered to allow students already enrolled in that program to complete their degree or certificate. 7. Evaluation and Assessment (i) An institution shall evaluat e a distance education program's educational effectiveness, including assessments of student learning outcomes, student retention, student and faculty satisfaction, and cost - effectiveness. MUIH administers a standardized online student evaluation process at the end of each trimester for all courses, using the IDEA course evaluation tool and Campus Labs online platform. Individual faculty members may also add course -specific items to the standardized evaluation instrument. Faculty members have access to the results of their student course evaluation r esults. Academic and Program Directors also have access to the student course evaluation results of the faculty teaching courses in their department/program. The Directors review and discuss t hese results with faculty on an ongoing basis, and use these res ults to guide referrals of faculty for additional support, future staffing assignments, and recommendations for appointment, rank, and promotion. 41 When an online or blended course first launches, the design team continually monitors it, and consults with t he instructors and Academic and Program Directors to make adjustments to the course as needed. Academic and Program Directors, in collaboration with faculty in their department/program, review the curriculum, learning objectives, and learning outcome resul ts of all courses, regardless of the delivery format, on an annual basis. Any needed substantive curricular changes are reviewed and approved by the faculty, department curriculum commit tee, and University curriculum committee. Any needed changes to the on line or blended course Syllabus, course structure, learning modules, activities, instructional materials, or assessments are reviewed with CTL, and placed on the university's annual onli ne and blended course development schedule. Enrollments and retention rates for all programs, specific to each delivery format, and their impact on the university's budget are tracked and analyzed on an ongoing basis by the university's Vice Presidents, Associate Vice President for Enrollment Management, and the Academic an d Program Directors. The results of comprehensive exams and projects, clinical evaluations, portfolios, peer -to-peer evaluations, patient outcomes and feedback, licensure examinations, a nd graduate surveys for all programs, specific to each delivery format , are also tracked and analyzed. The results of all such reports are used to make adjustments as needed in online and blended courses and programs with respect to curriculum, course deve lopment, student and faculty support, staffing, library and technology resources, marketing, recruitment and admissions, tuition/fees and budget, new course and program development, and course and program discontinuation. (ii) An institution shall demonst rate an evidence -based approach to best online teaching practices. MUIH's principles of best practice for developing and teaching online and blended courses are based on nationally recognized research -based standards, including those of Quality Matters, t he Online Learning Consortium (OLC), EDUCAUSE, WICHE Cooperative for E ducational Technologies (WCET), National University Technology Network (NUTN), the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, and the Council of Regional Accrediting Commissions (C -RAC). CTL and the academic leadership continually participate in profess ional development activities to keep abreast of evidence -based approaches in online and blended teaching and learning practices. When appropriate, such opportunities are also provided to faculty. These online and blended teaching practices are then incorpo rated into faculty, student, and course development practices conducted by CTL, the Faculty Senate, and academic programs. (iii) An institution shall provide for assessment and documen tation of student achievement of learning outcomes in a distance educa tion program. Online and blended courses are included in the university's overarching academic assessment plan. Expected student learning outcomes are clearly stated centrally and in sy llabi at the course and programmatic levels, and are the same for each course regardless of the delivery format of each section of the course. With MUIH's master course philosophy, consistent delivery of certain content and utilization of common key assess ment tools allows more precise learning outcomes assessment across various occurrences or sections of the online course. As part of the standard online and blended course design process at MUIH, course assessments are required to be aligned with the stated course learning outcomes, as specified by Standard 2 (Learning Object ives/Competencies) and Standard 3 (Assessment and Measurement) of the Quality Matters Rubric. The Academic and Program Directors, in collaboration with the Learning Outcomes Assessment Team (LOAT), Assistant Provost for Academic Assessment and Accreditati on, and Assistant Provost of CTL 42 compare attainment of course and programmatic learning objectives by students in online, blended, and face -to-face courses, reporting this data to the Pr ovost to ensure its inclusion in continuous assessment of the Universi ty's courses and programs. Any needed changes to the online or blended courses, revealed by learning outcome discrepancies with the face -to-face instances of the same course, are reviewe d with CTL, and placed on the university's annual online and blended c ourse development schedule.
