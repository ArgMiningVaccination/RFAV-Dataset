Kinney Drugs President John Marraffa says RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common respiratory virus. It [tends to hit the very young and the very old](/news/story/47046/20221216/north-country-hospitals-are-seeing-more-severe-rsv-infections) the hardest. \"We're noticing that elderly people, patients 60-plus, can really have dangerous complications from RSV.\" RSV can cause coughing, sneezing, difficulty breathing and high fever. Marraffa says the new vaccine aims to protect seniors from dangerous infections. He spoke with Champlain Valley reporter Cara Chapman. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. Cara ChapmanHere's what North Country seniors need to know about the new RSV vaccine CARA CHAPMAN: Can you talk about the work that went into developing the RSV vaccine? And what did scientists do to make sure that it's safe? JOHN MARRAFFA: Every time a vaccine comes to the health care space, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is responsible for examining all the data. They're required to look at the safety and efficacy of each vaccine. Vaccine manufacturers are not permitted to distribute the vaccine until the FDA releases it, and then the FDA has to review all of the manufacturer's test results. That includes sterility, purity, potency, and then they essentially perform confirmatory testing to make sure that the vaccine is doing what it's supposed to do. It was no different for the RSV vaccine. CHAPMAN: Are there any side effects to watch out for that came out of those trials and that research? MARRAFFA: The same side effects that happen with most vaccines: some injection site redness and pain at the injection site, some mild to moderate headaches. But nothing that was alarming. CHAPMAN: I've heard the vaccine is coming out in September. How can people get it once it's available? MARRAFFA: The vaccine has been approved and there are two formulations out there. Pharmacists in New York state are now permitted to give the vaccine, so we'll start to see the manufacturers, the distributors, everybody kind of coming together to make sure that the vaccine is widely available. The best course of action for anybody interested in getting the vaccine is to really spend some time on [our website](https://kinneydrugs.com/pharmacy/vaccinations/) and sign up for our health alerts, which would include information around RSV. We're not going to open up appointments until we have vaccine in our possession because we really want to make sure that we have it. And then as soon as we have it, we'll open appointments that same day. CHAPMAN: Is the vaccine rollout mostly concentrated on pharmacies like Kinney? Or can people also get it through their health care providers or local health departments? MARRAFFA: It's really going to depend on the individual provider if they're going to be able to stock vaccine and actually administer the vaccine. I can tell you from a pharmacy perspective that we will have this in every one of our Kinney Drugs across New York and Vermont. I can't speak for the other providers out there. NCPR provides this essential service. You provide your essential support.You put the \"public\" in this public service. Donations from you and your neighbors are a big part of what makes our quality journalism possible. Please make a donation now to support NCPR's continuing efforts to be everything you count on us to be. CHAPMAN: I've been covering COVID for the last few years, and when the first COVID vaccines came onto the scene, the appointments booked up super quickly. Do you anticipate demand for the RSV vaccine is also going to be high? Or is word still spreading about it? MARRAFFA: I think that the education piece still needs to happen first. And then I think we'll start to see the vaccine appointments start to uptick and we'll really get people vaccinated. It really is going to depend on the season that we have, right? But I look at it from my perspective. If I were 60-plus, I don't know that I would take that chance when you have a vaccine that's available to protect you. I think as soon as the vaccine is available, people who are eligible should go out there and get it. CHAPMAN: We've had the flu shot for a very long time, the COVID vaccine is also on the list of recommended seasonal vaccines and now we have the RSV vaccine. What are the recommendations for older adults as far as getting those three shots, the order they get them in or how they should space them out? MARRAFFA: The recommendation from all of the health care providers, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the FDA is really for everybody to get the three vaccines. As for when to get them, the CDC has also stated that RSV is safe to get with other vaccines. The problem that I think people are going to face is whether they want to wait for the RSV vaccine to become available, or if they want to get their flu and COVID shots as soon as they can. It's all going to come down to a timing issue of when the individual patient wants to get their vaccines, but they are safe to get together. CHAPMAN: Right, and Kinney is going to have the COVID and flu shots available alongside the RSV vaccine, correct? MARRAFFA: Yep. We predominantly are expecting to see an influx in demand for the flu shot, like we do every year. Flu has kind of been the standard vaccine so we can anticipate and plan for that. We think that demand for the RSV vaccine will come shortly behind that. Flu shots are available today in all of our Kinney pharmacies, especially the high-dose one which is the most preferred for elderly patients. "}
