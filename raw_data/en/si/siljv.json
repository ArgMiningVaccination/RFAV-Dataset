TO PROVIDE SUBSTANCE USE DET OXIFICATION SERVICES IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF $9,6 45,441 ($48, 300 INCREASE) RECOMMENDATION S A. Approve Amendment No. 2 (Master Contract No. 900090 , Procurement Contract No. 20255 ) with Horizon Services, Inc., (Principal: Christy Hayes ; Location: Hayward ) to fund a Medical Director position for existing Substance Use Detoxification Services, with no change in the contract period of 7/1/ 20 - 6/30/ 21, increasing the amount from $ 9,597,141 to $9,645,441 ($48,300 increase ); and B. Delegate authority to the Agency Director , or designee , to negotiate and execute the agreement under the Community -Based Organization master contract process , subject to review and approval as to form by County Counsel, and submit an executed copy to the Clerk of the Board for filing . DISCUS SION/SUMMARY Substance Use Disorder (SUD) services through Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH) currently operate under the Drug Medi -Cal (DMC) Waiver which allows for additional generation of DMC revenue to support essential SUD services. One of the r equirements for the DMC Waiver is the provision of a clinically -managed residential detoxification service, designated by the American Society of Addiction Medicine criteria as Level 3.2 withdrawal management services (ASAM Level 3.2 services) . ACBH curre ntly contracts with Horizon Services, Inc. (Horizon) to provide ASAM Level 3.2 services through Cherry Hill, which provides the Sobering Station and Detoxification Center in San Leandro. ASAM Level 3.2 service s are for those individuals needing initial 24 -hour support to enter into and complete detoxification. Such a level of care serves as a gateway for individuals with SUDs to enter into the recovery process and to transition into the next appropriate service, whether that be residential treatment, inte nsive outpatient treatment services, or another level of care. This ASAM 3.2 level of care is required by the DMC Waiver as it greatly increases the likelihood of the individual entering into continuing treatment and recovery. The Cherry Hill Sobering Station provides 50 co -ed beds for individuals to stay for less than 24 hours to recover from immediate substance use intoxication. About half of these individuals then proceed to longer stays at the AGENDA _____ December 15, 2020 The Honorable Board of Supervisors November 24, 2020 Page 2 of 2 Detoxification Program, which has 32 beds that offer AS AM Level 3.2 services and an average stay of four to six days. ACBH currently contracts for 20 beds at the Sobering Station and 2 7 beds at the Detoxification Center. For many years, Alameda County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) has been providing the required Medical Director staffing to support services at Cherry Hill. The Memorandum of Understanding between ACBH and EMS to provide Medical Director staffing for this program is ending and they will deploy the current staff to support Alameda County's Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID -19) efforts. T he current Cherry Hill allocation does not support funding for a Medical Director . Your Board's approval of this augmentation will allow Horizon to hire a Medical Director to provide physical health and medical clearance consultation services for clients served at Cherry Hill Detox and Sobering Center and continue to meet regulatory requirements for ASAM Level 3.2 services . SELECTION CRITERIA This request is for an augmentation to an existing program. ACBH issued a Request for Proposal ( RFP) on June 1, 2007 to operate the Sobering Station and Detoxification Center . A Bidders Conference was held on June 19, 2007 and four agencies were represented. Two proposals were submitted by the due date of July 11, 200 7. ACBH facilitated an Evaluation Committee composed of key stakeholders from several different groups on July 23 and 24, 2007, and Horizon was selected and approved by your Board to provide this service on September 11, 2007 (Item No. 17). Your Board ap proved Horizon to continue to operate Cherry Hill in FY 20 20-21 on June 23, 2020 (Item No. 4) and your Board approved an augmentation for Cherry Hill to support additional staffing and telephone infrastructure on September 22, 2020 (Item No. 13) . As a non -profit community -based organization, Horizon is exempt from the County's Small, Local, and Emerging Business (SLEB) policy but elected to be a certified small business under the County's SLEB Program (No. 20-00093 ; Expiration Date 10/31/2021). FINANCING Appropriations for this augmentation ($48,300) are included in the FY 2020-21 ACBH Approved Budget . Approval of these recommendations will have no impact on net County cost. VISION 2026 GOAL The addition of a Substance Use Detoxification Services medi cal director meet s the 10 X goal pathway of Healthcare for All in support of the shared vision of a Thriving and Resilient Population .

Under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7501 -7507) and Board policy, the County has the responsibility to determine whether organizations receiving funds through the County have spent them in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, contract terms, and gr ant agreements. To this en d, effective with the first fiscal year beginning on and after December 26, 2014, the following are required. I. AUDIT REQUI REMENTS A. Funds f rom Federal Sources: 1. Non-Federal entities which are determined to be subrecipients by the supervising department according to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.330 and which expend annual Federal awards in the amount specified in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501 are required to have a single audit performed in a ccordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.514. 2. When a non-Federal entity expends annual Federal awards in the amount specified in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501(a) under only one Federal program (excluding R&D) and the Federal program's statutes , regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award do not require a financial statement audit of the auditee, the non-Federal entity may elect to have a program-specific audit condu cted in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.507 (Program Specific Audits). 3. Non-Federal entities which expend annual Federal awards less than the amount specified in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501(d) are exempt from the single audit requirements for that year except that the County may require a limite d-scope audit in a ccordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 .
