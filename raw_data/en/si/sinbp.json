Thankfully, our local public health experts have answers. The Dallas Morning News on Wednesday hosted a Zoom call with science writer Alejandra Canales speaking to Dr. Erin Carlson, the director of graduate public health programs at the University of Texas at Arlington, and Dr. James Cutrell, an associate professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Here's what they had to say on several key topics. The pandemic in Dallas-Fort Worth: Cutrell said that data through Oct. 9 shows some encouraging signs for North Texas, with hospitalizations down about 30 percent in Dallas and Tarrant counties. Deaths appear to have plateaued and started to decline as well. \"Currently, the trends that we're seeing in terms of cases and hospitalizations are encouraging,\" he said. \"We are cautiously optimistic.\" Still, he noted that pediatric hospitalizations are still higher than in any of our previous surges. A vaccine for kids: Cutrell said that Pfizer's vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11 could be available by early November, with a shot for younger kids possibly coming sometime in 2022. He said the FDA is reviewing Pfizer's data on the children's vaccine and will make recommendations on whether an emergency-use authorization should be issued. The children's vaccine from Pfizer is a smaller dose, about a third the size of an adult dose, Cutrell said. He said that the vaccine appears to be quite effective in kids but that the FDA advisory committee will be looking closely at the safety of the vaccine. Kids aren't typically at high risk of severe symptoms with COVID-19, so the safety of the vaccine is vitally important. Cutrell said that the FDA is looking for any rare side effects, such as the inflammation of the heart that has been seen in some young men. Cutrell said that the current data suggests that even given this rare side effect, the vaccine is still beneficial. He noted that COVID-19 can cause heart issues and other severe side effects. \"I want everybody to feel very, very good about the scientific rigor and the process itself,\" Carlson said. Carlson said that kids need to be vaccinated in large numbers to help control COVID-19. She said that the more unvaccinated people we have, the more likely we are to see variants \u2014 including possibly a variant that could be more dangerous to children. Cutrell agreed. \"Until we're all safe and protected, no one is fully protected,\" he said. Public health challenges: \"If we want to control this epidemic, we have to control the info-demic,\" Carlson said. \"The only thing unprecedented about this pandemic is the info-demic.\" She noted that health experts had been saying for a decade that a pandemic was coming. But what caught them off guard, she said, was the degree to which our society distrusts science. She said public health experts must find out why people distrust science so much and are so willing to believe \u2014 and spread \u2014 misinformation on social media. She noted that many vaccine-hesitant people are starting to come around, in contrast with the hardcore antivaxxer community. Carlson said that health experts made a big error initially in viewing the antivaxxer population as a fringe group and failing to see the kind of traction it has gotten in society, particularly on social media. The challenge, Carlson said, is to make social media a place that can help control a pandemic rather than fuel it. Should you get vaccinated if you've had COVID-19? Cutrell said that people who are infected with COVID-19 do gain some immune protection, particularly in the first three months. But he said that some of the new variants are able to cause reinfection. He said that those who have had a prior COVID-19 infection and get a vaccine will have robust protection, which some have likened to \"superboosters or super-immunity.\" You will have much more substantial protection with a vaccine, even if you had a prior infection, he said. Carlson noted that people who get the vaccine after having a COVID-19 infection can have 100 times more antibodies than people who recovered from the virus but didn't get the vaccine. Can vaccinated people spread COVID-19? Cutrell said that the main goal of the vaccines was always to prevent severe disease, not to prevent all infections, and he said the vaccines have been highly effective in this regard. He said that people who are vaccinated aren't able to sustain high enough antibodies in their nose and throat \u2014 the primary entry points for the virus \u2014 to completely prevent infection. But once vaccinated people are exposed to the virus, their body's immune system typically kicks in quickly and controls the virus, he said. The vaccine shortens the amount of time that people are infectious, he said, noting that it's not accurate to say that vaccinated and unvaccinated people spread COVID-19 at the same rate. Why do we need boosters? Cutrell noted that there's a slight difference between a third dose and a booster. Some people with weakened immune systems, such as organ transplant patients or cancer patients, do not mount a strong enough immune response with two doses of the vaccines, he said, so a third dose was recommended in August. He said that this is not uncommon and that other vaccines often work this way as well. Pfizer and Moderna third shots have been approved for individuals with weakened immune systems. Cutrell said that some of these people may never have an effective immune response, so it's important for people around vulnerable individuals to help protect them. Then there's the concept of boosters, Cutrell said. He said that we have seen an increase in cases among the vaccinated population, which probably has a lot to do with the more virulent delta variant, as well as changes in behavior. But another factor, he said, is probably waning immunity. He said that this happens over time with all vaccines and was expected. Cutrell said the FDA concluded that the vaccines are still highly effective at preventing severe illness, but it identified certain groups that would benefit from a booster shot: people over age 65, people over age 50 with a high-risk medical condition, and people ages 18 to 49 with a medical condition. Individuals who live or work in a high-risk environment can consider a booster as well, he said, but this should be an individual decision. Keeping safe this Halloween: Carlson said that it's safe to go trick-or-treating this Halloween. But she suggested we do a few things to keep it safer, such as conducting our holiday activities outdoors as much as possible instead of indoors, wearing a mask and being physically distanced. She suggested keeping the candy bowl outside and handing candy out to children one by one, rather than letting a bunch of germy hands into the bowl. "}
