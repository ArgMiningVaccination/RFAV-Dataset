SYNOPSIS TITLE ALLTogether -1- A Treatment study protocol of the ALLTogether Consortium for children and young adults (1 -45 years of age) with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) CHIEF INVESTIGATOR Mats Marshall Heyman, M.D. PhD SPONSOR Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden CLINICAL PHASE Clinical phase III STUDY DESCRIPTION The treatment protocol collects the experience of previousl y successful treatment of children and young adults , with ALL from a number of well -renowned study groups into a new platform protocol, which is both a comprehensive system for stratification and treatment of ALL in this age -group as well as the basis for several randomised trials included in the study -design. The preconditions/hypotheses behind this protocol are: 1. Failures of the current treatment of ALL in children and young adults are due to both under - and over -treatment. Under -treatment is mainly manifested as relapse whereas over -treatment is associated with induction death, death in complete remission and secondary malignancy. 2. Further general intensification of therapy is not likely to yield improved results, because of the obvious risk of increa sed incidence of adverse outcomes resulting from over -treatment. 3. Further refinement of the stratification based on biological characteristics and measurable residual disease (M RD) - formerly referred to as minimal residual disease - may define patients fo r which therapy can be safely reduced and patients for which new therapeutic approaches need to be explored 4. Experimental more targeted therapy may replace more toxic conventional therapy with equal or superior outcome due to equal or superior antileukaem ic efficacy and reduced toxicity.

A sub -group of patients will be identified that may benefit from novel immunothe rapy. Specific Primary Objective per intervention 1. To test, in a randomised fashion, if de -intensification of therapy can be safely applied in standard risk (SR) and in a fraction of intermediate risk (IR -low) patients defined by a combination of geneti c and measurable residual disease (MRD) criteria. 2. To test, in a randomised fashion, if an experimental intensification : - the addition of two cycles of the CD22 targeted compound Inotuzumab to BCP-patients in a defined sub -population of Intermediate Risk (IR) BCP-patients with high risk of relapse (IR -high) improve s the disease -free survival (DFS) by a reduction in the risk of relapse. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 19 3. To introduce targeted therapy with the Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Imatinib for patients that may benefit from this i ntervention based on the identification of TKI -targets by genetic analysis of the leukaemic cells. The diversity and combined rarity of these aberrations makes randomised comparisons difficult and therefore, this intervention will not be randomised. Baseli ne data regarding leukaemia -specific outcomes will be collected. 4. To define a population of B -cell precursor (BCP) patients with a very high risk of relapse that may be eligible for innovative immunologic therapy with genetically engineered autologous T -cells (CAR -T cells) in separate CAR -T trials. The leukaemia -specific outcomes of such patients will be recorded . Specific Secondary Objectives per Intervention 1. To investigate if the patients for whom the leukaemia was de -instensified in the SR - and IR -low risk -group randomisations derived any benefit from this de-intensif ication. Thus, overall survival and leukaemia -specific adverse outcomes will be balanced against secondary measures of toxicity from treatment, partly taking into account the toxicity of relapse treatment. In addition, quality of life (QoL) will be measure d to ascertain and compare the burden of therapy for surviving patients. 2. To ascertain if the addition of Inotuzumab impacts overall survival or other leukaemic adverse outcomes and in addition to assess if the additional toxicity induced by the treatment -intensification with Inotuzumab is significant and acceptable. QoL will also be measured to assess the burden of therapy including the experimental intensification for surviving patients. 3. For patients treated with TKI for ABL -class fusion driven ALL, baseli ne data regarding overall survival, specific leukaemic outcomes, toxicity and burden of therapy measured as QoL will be collected for future comparisons. 4. For patients defined as eligible for CAR -T survival, specific leukaemic adverse events, toxicity and b urden of therapy (QoL) resulting from both conventional HR -therapy and CAR -T cell treatment will be measured. Historically, these patients have suffered from very severe toxicity and even if current leukaemia -specific results seem acceptable, there are goo d reasons to explore if these patients can be cured with less toxic therapy. Tertiary, Exploratory Objectives 1. To form a comprehensive master protocol for treatment of ALL in children and young adults using the experience of several leading study -groups in the field in Western Europe with the view to both improve the overall leukaemia - specific outcome as well as to create a basis for research into the specifics of treatment , disease biology including translational aspects. We aim to make this master protocol into a dynamic platform by making interventions \"modular\" and possible to \"plug -in\" and stop independently of each other. 2. To increase the statistical power of the conso rtium by the joining together of different study -groups, thereby increasing the recruitment greatly. This increase in statistical power is essential, because of the ever increasing identification of new biological sub -groups, that increase the demand for patient -numbers in sub -group analyses as well as in potential interventions. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 20 3. To improve the stratification of patients by the use of combined clinical, genetic and MRD -data, specifically improving the MRD -based stratification by the combined use of PCR - as well as flow -cytometry (FCM) based techniques. Thresholds for MRD cut -offs will partly be determined by genetic group, using on a novel model based on pooled data from the study -groups in the consortium. 4. To evaluate the performance of the master protocol t hat will apply a novel system for risk -stratification as well as a new standard of care (SOC) for risk - adapted therapy. The overall results need to be compared with historic controls to ensure that the novel stratification -system and the proposed interven tions do not cause the overall results to deteriorate. The evaluation of overall results is also important to ascertain the outcome of patients that for a variety of reasons (demographic or leukaemia subtype, toxicity, personal preference) were not includ ed in the randomised or non - randomised interventions. 5. To include both children and young adults in the same treatment protocol to better understand the impact of age on risk -stratification, tolerance to therapy as well as leukaemia -specific outcomes and to xicity. 6. To include QoL -measurements in the evaluation of ALL -therapy also for patients not taking part in any of the interventions of the protocol - both for this trial and for future reference . The majority of patients will survive, a fraction of patient s may be over-treated and a significant number of survivors suffer from toxicity both short - and long -term. Such measurements may serve as historic controls for future interventions and since we cannot foresee which sub-groups of patients that will be the targets of these interventions, it is important to obtain baseline measurements of quality of life from all patients. 7. To use therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Asparaginase -activity SOC to allow for the rational replacement of Pegylated Asparaginase (PE G-Asp) in the case of silent inactivation and for assessment of allergic -like reactions to PEG -Asp. 8. To evaluate the impact of measured Asp -activity on both leukaemia -specific outcomes as well as on toxicity. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 21 Table 2.

Essential data missing from the registration of characteristics at diagnosis (in consultation with the protocol chair) . For each intervention/randomisation an additional set of exclusion -criteria is provided. Patients who are not eligible according to the in - or exclusion criteria above will not be protocol -patients . However, in the case the treating physician considers the ALLTogether protocol their best available SOC, they may be treated according to the protocol at the discretion of the treating physician . Furthermore, they may be registered in a separate database of the ALLTogether consortium for non -protocol patients if this registration is compatible with the legal framework of the country in question and informed con sent for this registration is obtained . ENDPOINTS - OUTCOME Primary Endpoint /Outcome - The primary endpoint for the whole protocol (compared with the legacy protocols of the participating study -groups forming the consortium) is event - free survival (EFS) - as defined in the protocol. - The primary endpoint for the randomised interventions is disease -free survival (DFS) - as defined in the protocol. Secondary Endpoints/Outcomes - The most important secondary outcome is overall survival (OS). Additional meas ures of antileukaemic efficacy are: incidence of induction death, resistant disease (in this protocol referred to as protocol therapy failure) , relapse, death in first complete remission and second malignancy. - Over - and under -treatment events will also be combined into resulting treatment -related mortality and leukaemia specific mortality. - Since over -treatment also includes cured patients who suffer serious toxicity and potentially permanent side -effects, data will be continuously collected regarding the incidence of a number of adverse events of special interest (AESI s), the most important of which are: pancreatitis, osteonecrosis, venous thrombo -embolism and neurological deficits. - The de -intensifcation randomisations will also collect data on the specif ic burden of therapy during and immediately following the randomised phases concerning a number of parameters, for instance incidence of neutropienic infections, days in hospital with antibiotics, analgesics and nutritional support. - The intensification -randomisations will collect endpoints concerning the specific potential toxicity of the randomised interventions, most notably liver toxicity including VOD/SOS. Since the protocol includes both small children, adolescents and young adults, all end points will be analysed for the entire population as well as for the age groups 1 - 15.99y, 16 -24,99y and 25 -45y and comparisons will also be made between the age groups. STUDY DESIGN The treatment protocol is an international multi -centre prospective, open label study with several randomised parts (phase III) arranged as a master protocol with additional non-randomised and randomised interventions . This will make it possible to start the backbone of the study initially and plugging in the randomised trials and other interventions in a modular fashion as these are ready to start (see Figure 1). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 24 STUDY DURATION The primary recruitment -period for the comprehensive master protocol, including the study specific interventions is planned to be 6 years including an extended recruitment for the part of the protocol in which de -escalation of treatment intensity in the Intermediate -low risk arm (R2) is tested. Recruitment to the intensification randomisation (R3 - InO) and the de -intensification rand omisation in the standard -risk arm (R1) is estimated to need a shorter recruitment time of 5 years. The leukaemia -specific outcomes should have a minimum of five years follow -up for the last patient recruited for the whole protocol and for the de -escalation randomisations. The minimum follow -up time for the intensification randomisation is 2 years from randomisation . Additional separate studies measuring long -term toxicity and late effects may require longer follow -up. When applicable, the follow -up may also be extended by the use of population -based registries. DESCRIPTION OF SITES/FACILITIES ENROLLING PATIENTS The comprehensive master protocol, including the study specific interventions will be conducted by a consortium of study -groups representing 14 European countries and 8 study -groups. The age -groups and the number of centres are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

Randomisation 1: We define a population of standard risk ( SR) patients for which the baseline therapy is minimized and in this population, it is tested if therapy can be safely reduced by the randomised omission of Doxorubicin in the Delayed Intensification phase of treatment. 2. Randomisation 2: We define a sub -populat ion of intermediate risk (IR -Low) patients with a low risk of relapse (IR -low) with standard IR -therapy and in this population, it is tested if the therapy may be safely reduced by the randomised omission of either Doxorubicin in the Delayed Intensificatio n phase of treatment or the omission of Vincristine (VCR)/ Dexamethasone (Dex a) pulses in the Maintenance phase of treatment. 3. Randomisation 3: We define a sub -population of IR patients with high risk of relapse (IR -high) and in this population, it is tested i f the relapse -risk can be reduced (and thereby the disease -free survival increased) by the randomised introduction of two cycles a new agent (Inotuzumab) before the Maintenance phase 4. TKI intervention: For patients with ABL -class fusion genes in their leukaemic clone, possibly inhibitable by the use of TKIs, the TKI Imatinib will be introduced from day 15 of induction (<25 years) or day 30 (25 years) . 5. Definition of patients for possibl e separate CAR -T cell trials : We define a population of B -cell precursor (BCP) patients with high risk of relapse (HR) for whom intensive high -risk chemotherapy or allogeneic haematopoietic stem - cell transplantation (allo -HSCT) is considered standard of ca re (SOC). In this patient population, we design a stratification -system and initial therapy as well as logistic arrangements (harvest of autologous T -cells) allowing these patients to be enrolled in separate trials investigating the experimental use of genetically engineered autologous T -cells (so called CAR -T cells) to improve the chance of cure while avoiding many of the toxic side -effects of allo -SCT. The remaining patients with HR -characteristics will be treated according to the protocol HR -arm and thei r EFS as well as their secondary outcomes will be compared with the patients in the CAR -T trials as well as with historic controls. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 26 TREATMENT OVERVIEW Figure 1. Comprehensive overview of the ALLTogether protocol ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 27 ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 28 Stratification and initial therapy The patients will eventually be divided into five treatment strata ( SR, IR-low, IR -high, HRchemo and The induction therapy (with ad aptions for high risk patients - see below ) consist of: Dexamethasone (6mg/m2/d x 28 Asparagainase (PEG -Asp) 1500 IU/m2 (1000 IU/m2 for patients 16 years) x 2 for patients<25 years and x 1 for patients 25 -45 years and 2 injections (age - dependent dosing see treatment detail s) of in trathecal chemotherapy (Methotrexate for most patients Methotrexate, Cytarabine and Prednisolone - ITT for patients with CNS3 or traumatic lumbar puncture with detectable leukaemic cells and elevated CSF cell count or patients who d o not clear leukaemic ce lls from the CSF by day 15). For patients with CNS2 or CNS3/TLP+ -status at diagnosis an additional 1 (CNS2) or 2 (CNS3/TLP+) doses will be administered during induction. BCP patients (NCI standard risk ): - aged 1 -10 years - with a highest White Blood Cell Count (WBC) before start of therapy of <50.0x109/L. These patients constitute a group with lower risk of therapy failure and will only get the induction therapy described above. BCP patients, with initial NCI standard risk, and HR -genetics (KMT2A - rearrangements, hypodiploidy <40 containing Daunorubicin (4 5mg/m2/dose ) day 16 and 23. Patients with either - T-cell ALL or NCI high -risk: - WBC 50.0x109/L and/or - age 10 years at diagnosis will receive high -risk induction consisting of all therapy included in the low -risk induction with the addition of Daunorubicin 25mg/m2/dose x 4. All patients with Down syndrome will start induction without Anthracycline, but Daunorubicin (45mg/m2) will be added day 16 if response to initial therapy is inadequate (MRD 25% by FCM day 15). Stratification 2 The therapy -response will be evaluated on day 29 after initiation of therapy (time - point 1 - TP1), after which the mai n stratification of the protocol into Standard risk (SR), intermediate risk (IR) and high risk (HR) groups will occur. Stratification 3 The response to consolidation therapy for patients who are MRD -positive at TP1 will be re-evaluated on day 50 and/or 71 after initiation of therapy (time -point 1.5 day 50 and tim e-point 2 day 71 - TP2), which determines the final risk -grouping. SR-patients SR-patients , estimated to constitute 22% of all patients (23% of patients <16 years at diagnosis) fulfil all criteria: - BCP immunophenotype - CNS1 or CNS2 at diagnosis ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 29 - no TLP+ at diagnosis (TLP with detectable leukaemic cells in the CSF at diagnosis ) - at TP1 . Patients with SR-stratification will not undergo any further MRD -based stratification and will receive Consolidation 1 therapy consisting of: VCR 1.5 mg/m2 x 1, PEG -Asp (dose 1500/1000 U/m2/dose according to age, activity monitored by TDM) x 2 (x 3 for patients 25, who only had one dose PEG -Asp during induction) , 6-Mercaptopurine 60mg/m2/day x 16 and intrathecal Mtx x 2 doses. Continued therapy for SR-patients consists of Consolidation 2, SR-Delayed intensification ( SR-DI) and Maintenance therapy. Consolidation 2: 6MP 25mg/m2/day x weeks, High 2. Delayed Intensification: Dex a (10mg/m2/day x 5 days x 2 cycles), VCR 1.5 mg/m2/dose x 3, Doxorubicin 30mg/m2/dose x 3. ITT x 2 doses. The three doses of Doxorubicin are omitted in the experimental arm of Randomisation 1 . Maintenance: Oral 6MP x 1 daily and Met hotrexate (Mtx) x 1 weekly. Doses titrated after peripheral blood counts. Duration of Maintenance until 2 years after completed induction therapy. Three dose s of intrathecal Mtx is administered (12-weekly) at the beginning of Maintenance. IR-patients All (IR - and HR -patients) patients not fulfilling SR risk-criteria will go on to receive modified standard phase IB consolidation and IR-patients will be finally risk -stratified after this phase at day 71 (time -point 2 - TP2). The standard IB Consolidation 1 consists of all drugs administered in the SR- consolidation with the addition of Cyclophosphamide 1000mg/m2/dose x 2, PEG -Asp (dose 1500/1000 U/m2/dose according to age, activity monitored by TDM) x 3 and intrathecal medication x 3. IR-low patients IR-low patients (estimated to constitute approximately 36% of all patients) fulfil these criteria: - Age <16 years at diagnosis - no CNS3 or TLP+ with 5 leukocytes/microL CSF at diagnosis - no HR -genetic aberrations ( defined above under SR-patients) and one of MRD <0.1% TP1 -67 chromosomes - MRD <0.05% at B TG1; or ETV6 deletion with a of BTG1, PAX5, CDKN2A/B. \"CNA Poor Risk\" (CNA PR) = Copy -number alteration poor -risk - all other patterns. - BCP ALL patients have to have MRD at TP2 < 0.05% ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 30 - T-cell ALL have to fulfil the age -, CNS and HR -genetic criteria and have undetectable MRD at TP2. Continued therapy for IR -patients consists of Consolidation 2, IR -Delayed intensification (I L-DI), Consolidation 3 and Maintenance therapy. Consolidation 2: Identical to Consolidation 2 in SR. IR-Delayed intensification: Identical to the SR except the addition of one dose of Cyclophosphamide (1000mg/ m2x1). The three doses of Doxorubicin are omitted in one of the experimental arms of Randomisation 2 . Consolidation 3: Identical to IR-low Consolidation 2. Maintenance: Oral 6MP x 1 daily and Met hotrexate (Mtx) x 1 weekly. Doses titrated after peripheral blood counts. Duration of Maintenance until 2 years after completed induction therapy. One dose of intrathecal Mtx is administered at the beginning of Maintenance. Every four weeks Dex a (6mg/m2/day x 5) and VCR 1.5mg/m2 is given. The four -weekly VCR -Dexa pulses are omitted in one of the randomisation arms in Randomisation 2 . There is a n intrathecal Mtx dose administered every 3 months for patients with T -cell ALL with WBC 100x109/L. IR-high patients IR-high patients (estimated to constitute approximately 39% of all patients) will constitute all other cases, who are not stratified to high -risk (see below) including: - patients with failed mandatory genetic work -up. - patients with failed MRD -analyses at TP1 and/or TP2 . idation 2, IR -Delayed intensification (I -DI), Consolidation 3 and Maintenance therapy. Consolidation 2: Identical to the SR and IR -low but with the addition of PEG -Asp (dose 1500/1000 U/m2/dose according to age, activity monitored by TDM ) x 3 (x 4 for patients 25, who only had one dose PEG -Asp during induction) . Four 3 -week cycles (2 weeks with medication and 1 week without) consisting of Dex a (10mg/m2/day x 5 days), 6MP (50mg/m2/day) x 14 days, VCR 1.5mg/m2, Doxorubicin 30mg/m2. Consolidation 3: Identical to the IR -low arm. Maintenance therapy: The base of the therapy is identical to the IR -low arm, but includes VCR -Dexa pulses for all and 12-weekly intrathecal medicati on. Patients randomised to Inotuzumab in randomisation 3, will receive two cycles of Inotuzumab (InO) after Consolidation 2 and before Maintenance. Patients with ABL -class fusions start Imatinib already at day 15 during induction for patients <25 years at diagnosis and at day 30 for patients 25 -45. If not stratified to HR-therapy at TP2 , they go on with IR -high therapy + Imatinib as per protocol without taking part in any of the randomisations. HR-patients HR-patients (estimated to constitute approximately 3% of all patients) have BCP - MRD at TP1 5% or - MRD at TP2 0.05% or - NCI high -risk at diagnosis and MRD at TP2 TP2 0.01% or - - patients with extramedullary disease, who are not in CR1 at TP2 or - - t(17;19)(q22;p13) TCF3/HLF . ALLTogether Version Sep 2020 31 Patients with MRD 0.05% at TP2 are by protocol eligible for allo geneic H SCT. All HR-patients 16 years at diagnosis with are also eligible for allo- HSCT. Continued therapy for HR -patients consisting of six HR -blocks after Consolidation 1 for HR -chemo -patients. HR -HSCT -patients may be transplanted when an acceptable MRD for HSCT has been reached, normally at least three blocks. HR -chemo patients then go through a Maintenance 2 -phase consisting of Standard Maintenance with the addition of 3 high -dose Meth otrexate blocks 6 weeks apart, Delayed intensification (HR-DI, without Doxorubicin) and Standard Maintenance therapy wi TP1 TP2 or - patients with extramedullary disea se, who are not in CR1 at TP2 All T-cell patients who fulfil HR -criteria are eligible for allo -HSCT. Patients with MRD 5% at TP1, who have MRD 0.5% at day 50 will receive a block containing Ne larabine . If MRD day 50 is 5% - either (age -dependent): - single Nelarabine 650mg/m2/d x 5 (patients <21 ) or - single Nelarabine 1500mg/m2/dose e very other day x 3 (patients 21 ). If MRD day 50 is <5% Nelarabine will be given (as above) + the remaining part of Consolidation 1. Patients with MRD <5% TP1 who have MRD with MRD <0.01% at TP2 but have an HSCT indication may proceed to HSCT or receive IR -low Consolidation 2 (according to IR -high) awaiting tran splant. Patients with satisfactory response to Nelarabine -containing therapy may have another single Nelarabine block before HSCT. Patients who do not have satisfactory response to Nelarabine -containing therapy will have c ontinued therapy with 1-3 HR-blocks aiming to reduce MRD enough for HSCT. Patients with ABL -class fusions who fulfil HR -criteria at the end of Consolidation 1 due to high MRD go on to HR -therapy with allo -HSCT. The TKI may have had insufficient effect in cases with high MRD, but TKI-dosing may in these cases be individuali sed if it is assessed that they may benefit from addition of TKI , for instance in a situation in which it is difficult to reach MRD -negativity before allo -HSCT. Down - patients Patients with Down syndrome will have adapted stratification and therapy: Stratification will be into three groups: SR, IR and HR. Stratification will be based on clinical features, genetics and MRD as for other patients, but in addition, deletion of the IKZF1 -gene will be specific ally stratifying for Down patients. - SR-patients will fulfil all criteria and will be negative for IKZF1 -deletion. - IR-patients will be all IR -stratified patients and in addition patients without detectable MRD at day 29, but with IKZF1 -deletion. - HR-patients will be all patients with MRD 5% at the end of induction. Therapy will be adapted as follows: No Down -patients will have Daunorubicin routinely during induction. However, if Down patients respond poorly (10% MRD day 15), one dose (45mg/m2) of DN R will be administered on day 16 of induction. - SR-patients will have therapy as non -Down patients, except the Consolidation 2 - phase will be replaced by an Interim Maintenance Phase without High -dose Methotrexate. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 32 - IR-patients will have therapy according to the IR -high arm of the protocol, except that the Consolidation 2 and Consolidation 3 -phases of the Protocol will be replaced by a \"Capizzi\" treatment phase with intravenous Methotrexate in increasing doses without rescue according to toxicity after Con solidation 1. - HR-patients will not have HR -blocks. Instead, patients with MRD 5% on day 29 will go on to a prolonged Consolidation 1 -phase with an MRD -assessment on day 57 and 99. If the patient has not had a ny response on day 57 (equal or increasing leukaemia) , the patient is taken off protocol and is available for experimental intervention for refractory disease. Patients that respond on day 57 will receive the rest of the block and have a final assessment of response on day 99. If adequate response on day 57 and 99, patients will continue with IR -therapy. Patients not responding adequately on day 99 will also go off protocol and be available for experimental intervention and these patients will also be available for CAR -T therapy if they fulfil the cri teria for a CAR -T trial.

ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 40 5. BACKGROUND, AIMS, HY POTHESES, RATIONALES AND OBJECTIVES 5.1 Background Introduction Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) is the most common form of childhood malignancy, with an incidence that varies between approximately 2 -4 cases/100.000 children <20/year in different countries. The incidence in adults is approximately a third of that in children, indicating that the disease is relatively much more common among children when the limited time -span of childhood is taken into account [2]. Treatment results have improved over time due to risk -adapted therapy developed by cooperative groups [3-10]. The participating study -groups that form the ALLTogether Consortium (AT C): UKALL (UK), DCOG (the Netherlands), Co ALL (Germany), BSPHO (Belgium), NOPHO (Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Lithuania and Estonia), SHOP (Portugal), PHOAI (Ireland) and SFCE (France) are study -groups with a long - standing previous experience in designing treatment protocols for ALL in childhood and for young adults [5-8, 10] . BSPHO and parts of France has mainly participated through the EORTC [9], SHOP has participated in the EORTC or used protocols from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, PHOAI has participated in UKALL or COG protocols and the SFCE merges the experience from both the EORTC and the FRALLE -groups in France [9, 11] . This experience is a natural integrated part of the background for the ATP. The overall outcome of the recently published protocols (UKALL -2003, DCOG10, NOPHO ALL09), BSPHO, SHOP, PHOAI and SFCE are highly comparable. Some of these results are summarized in Table 4 and Figure 2. The results for adults are generally less encouraging than for children, but analyses of the results of young adults treated according to either adult protocols or paediatric style protocols have identified paediatric style protocols as means to improve results [15-17]. This has led to inclusion of young adults in the treatment protocols in the UKALL -group (ages 16 -24) and in NOPHO (ages 18 -45)[14, 16] . Remaining problems to address by the formation of the consortium In the discussions leading up to the formation of the consortium, representatives from the study -groups identified four major problem areas that should be addressed in a contemporary treatment protocol for ALL and that are better addressed by the consortiu m than the single study -groups. These four areas are interconnected and together they form the basis for the collaborative effort resulting in the ATP. The problem areas identified are: The cure of the remaining <10% of children and 20 -30% of adults that currently succumb to ALL despite our best efforts Over -treatment of a substantial fraction of patients The identification of new biological sub -groups with potential new targets for therapy. Lacking statistical power with improving results ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 41 5.1.2.1 The cure of t he remaining <10% of children and 20 -30% of adults that still die of ALL The prognosis for children and young adults with ALL has improved dramatically in the last 40 -50 years. This improvement was most pronounced during the earlier parts of the period and further improvement has been more and more difficult to achieve [18-20]. Currently, overall survival exceeds 90% for children and 70 -80% for young adults [12-14, 16, 21, 22] . The historic development of therapy has been characteri sed by a successive intensification of the treatment. The identification of clinical and genetic risk -factors and increasingly sophisticated means of meas uring early response to therapy by measurable residual disease (MRD) have refined the risk-stratification and improved risk -adapted treatment protocols [12, 13, 23 -26]. This intensification has had several effects apart from the generally improved outcome: First, truly resistant disease, not responding to any therapeutic measures has become very rare in ALL in children and young adults treated according to contemporary protocols [12-14, 27] . Second, further general intensification of therapy is not likely to improve the outcome, since the reduction in relapses means that, despite best possible care, an increasing fraction of adverse events are the result of treatment -related causes - death in first complete remission (DCR1) and second malignant neoplasm (SMN) [28-31]. Most deaths caused by disease is the result of relapse, but the relapses are not evenly distributed . Even if the best chance of cure is still in first complete remission, children who relapse late often present with standard -risk features at diagnosis and have a reasonable second chance of long -term survival, even with conventional chemotherapy, whereas particularly early relapse is associated with high -risk features at diagnos is, and a dismal prognosis [32-34]. The prognosis after relapse in adults is also very poor [35]. To cure the remaining patients with high -risk features, particularly those with poor response to initial therapy, high -risk early relapses, patients with multiple relapses and the few patients with truly resistant disease, new therapeutic principles (new drugs or new treatment modalities) need to be developed. The new therapy devised should probably be tested in all these conte xts at the same time to evaluate in which setting these new principles are most effective. 5.1.2.2 Over -treatment When treatment -results are compared over a longer time -period, considered in the context of the therapy given at that time and the successive intensification of therapy generally, it is obvious that a substantial fraction of all patients are over -treated w ith contemporary treatment protocols [18]. The over -treatment has several serious consequences: As already mentioned, one of the limiting factors for further intensification is the likely rise in treatment -related mortality, which is currently 3 -5% of all paediatric patie nts, but higher for young adults [13, 14, 16, 22, 28 -30, 36] . Furthermore, the consequences of acute and chronic toxicity is a fraction of long - term survivors that suffer from serious long -term consequences, which may limit their remaining expected life -span and impair their quality of life as a result of the therapy [37, 38] , for diabetes mellitus caused by pancreati tis [43-45]. A group that needs special co nsideration from this point of view are the patients, treated with allogeneic stem -cell transplant (allo -HSCT). Finally, also the protracted standard therapy imposes unnecessary burdens on the patients and their families with consequences for schooling, w ork and social life [46, 47]. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 42 De-escalation of thera py has been tried in three recent studies with at least some success [12, 13, 48] and needs to be tested further. However, even if a somewhat higher fraction of (curable) relapses may have to be accepted, it is of utmost importance to monitor if the total burden of therapy, for instance the fraction of patients treated with allo -HSCT in first and second remission decreases or increases as a result of the de -escalation. Since we are worried about long -term toxicity, it should also be our duty to measure the incidence of serious long -term outcomes systematically and include these parameter s in the follow -up of our patients and balance these outcomes against leukaemia -specific results. 5.1.2.3 New biological sub -groups with potentially new targets for therapy Advances in diagnostics identifying new genetic sub -groups constitute the type of progre ss that may change the fate of ALL -patients in two ways: If the biological sub - group has specific clinical features, particularly if the outcome is different from what is expected due to other factors, it may form a new basis for stratification [49]. The other possible impact is the identification of fusion -genes or deregulation of gene - products with crucial impact on the malignant transformation. In many cases, these gene -products have been protein -kinases that may be susceptible to pharmacological inhibition [50-53] in analogy with the well -known t(9;22) trans location resulting in BCR -ABL1 fusion and the opportunity for therapeutic intervention with tyrosine -kinase inhibitors (TKI s). Most of the more recently detected fusions detected so far have been so rare that although there are potentially new target for therapy, the outcome of these biological sub -group s are not known and no study -group would be able to study an intervention in a systematic fashion on their own. The further division of the patients into sub -groups also adds to the power - issues mentioned a bove. Contemporary treatment protocols should have a strategy both for detection of such new genetic sub -groups and for how they should be stratified and treated. If intervention is contemplated, it would be advisable to open this part of the trial for collaboration with other study -groups in an umbrella/basket -trial fashion, so that results from the intervention may be collected from an even larger study -population pooled from different study -groups [54]. The disease will remain ALL, but several targets will be addressed and additionally, different ther apeutic backbones will be used. 5.1.2.4 Lacking statistical power with improving results As the treatment results improve, it becomes statistically more and more difficult to show an improvement in leukaemia -related outcomes and conversely, the number of patients needed to detect a possible improvement becomes larger. This fact is a very strong incentive to expand the population -base for any study by merging study - groups. The lacking power to show improvement also puts new demands on study -design. We need to satisfy both the need for monitoring of overall leukaemia -specific and toxicity outcomes and at the same time being able to ask specific randomi sed questions for selected groups of patients. Si nce the recruitment - and event -rate of these sub -groups in the heterogeneous ALL -population may be very different, a contemporary protocol may have to use an adaptive study -design, in which randomi sed trials run at different pace and plug in and out of the protocol platform independently of each other in a modular fashion [55]. In the light of over -treatment of significant number of patients, some questions are ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 43 also likely to change from improvement in event -free- or overall survival in one of the arms to aiming for similar results in leukaemia -specific outcomes, but reduction in toxicity in other sub -groups.

ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 45 5.2 General Aims We want to improve the outcome of children and young adults with ALL by testing a number of randomised and non -randomised interventions. Since failure of the current treatment of ALL in children and young adults are due to both under - and over - treatment, b oth under - and over -treatment adverse outcomes are targeted. Thus, t hese interventions are designed to either: - decrease the risk of serious side -effects and therapy -failure by treatment -related death for patients at low risk of relapse. - decrease the risk of relapse for patients at high risk of relapse and therapy -failure by death from disease. - decrease the risk of relapse and reduce toxic side -effects for patients with genetic lesions targetable by Tyrosine -kinase inhibition by the addition of I matinib to standard chemotherapy. - decrease the risk of serious side -effects for patients with high -risk B -cell precursor ALL by making them available for experimental immunotherapy. Main Hypotheses 1. Failures of the current treatment of ALL in children and young adults are due to both under - and over -treatment. Under -treatment is mainly manifested as relapse whereas over-treatment is associated with induction death, death in complete remission and seco ndary malignancy. Further general intensification of therapy is not likely to yield improved results, because of the obvious risk of increased incidence of adverse outcomes resulting from over -treatment. We hypothesise that further refinement of the strat ification based on biological characteristics and MRD may define patients for which therapy can be safely reduced. 2. The above mentioned refined stratification will also identify patients with increased risk of relapse, for which new therapeutic approaches n eed to be explored. If the treatment -intensity for these patients is increased, it may increase the risk of treatment -related mortality more than the effect of the reduced relapse -risk. We hypothesise that more targeted therapy and therapy based on increa sed knowledge about the mechanism of action of known chemotherapeutic agents rather than dose -escalation could reduce the risk of relapse without excessive toxicity offsetting the results. 3. Biologic understanding of the pathogenesis of ALL has led to the id entification of potential targets for specific intervention. We hypothesise that experimental, targeted therapy added to moderately toxic conventional therapy may replace more toxic conventional therapy with equal or superior outcome due to equal or superi or antileukaemic efficacy and reduced toxicity. We acknowledge the problem of testing this hypothesis in a randomised trial due to low patient numbers. 4. Recently cellular immunotherapy with autologous T -cells genetically engineered with chimaeric T -cell ant igen receptors (CAR -T cells) directed toward defined antigens on the malignant clone has been developed. When used against antigens expressed on leukaemic BCP -cells, this type of therapy has shown very promising results in patients with advanced B -cell pre cursor disease. The therapy has been administered with significant, but manageable toxicity. One such therapy has recently achieved regulatory approval and there are a large number of phase 1 -2-trial using different constructs. We hypothesise that a group of BCP -patients at very high risk of relapse can be identified that may benefit from CAR -T therapy both in terms of a good antileukaemic effect and reduced toxicity compared with present highly toxic high -risk therapy and subsequent allogeneic haematopoiet ic stem cell transplantation. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 46 5.3 Rationale and Specific Objectives for the omission of anthracycline in the delayed intensification de - escalation randomisation in the SR -group (R1) Delayed intensification (DI) was introduced by the BFM -group in the 1970s [56]. Initially a therapy element used for high -risk feature ALL, it was later shown to improve the prognosis also for lower risk pat ients [57, 58] and is now included in most contemporary protocols, including all those of the consortium members , but some protocols have left out the DI in selected patient populations [26, 59] . Anthracyclines are highly efficacious antileukaemic compounds widely used in treatment of ALL, but are associated with significant toxicity. Acute toxicities include haematology and toxicity of mucosal membranes, liver and heart whereas con cern for long -term toxicity has focused on cardiac complications and the risk of secondary malignancy. The combination of Anthracyclines with particularly Dexamethasone enhances the toxicity in induction therapy [60, 61] (TRM) [12, 22] . These findings have led to omission of Anthracycline in NCI low -risk ALL [62], also adopted in for instance current UK -therapy. The selection of patients by NCI -risk during induction and more intensive therapy can account for some of the increased risk, but may not explain all of the significantly high er TRM overall [12] and from infectious causes [36]. Furthermore, the Co ALL-group found the highest rate of infectious complications during delayed intensification and a significant association with higher doses of anthracycline [63]. The stratified inclusion and omission of anthracycline in the DI - phase has been used in two consecutive NOPHO -protocols, NOPHO ALL -2000 and NOPHO ALL -2008 (SR patients had DI without anthracycline and the IR patients DI including anthracycline) [7, 14] . The toxicity -registration in these protocols has not allowed for detailed analysis of the prof ile by treatment arm, but the temporal pattern of the rather rare occurrence of TRM in these lower risk -groups reveals clustering in the DI -phase in IR -patients, but not in SR in the NOPHO ALL -2008 protocol (Fig 3). The long -term consequences of exposure t o anthracycline for cardiac function can be very severe with multiple cardiotoxic outcomes. For patients treated with anthracyclines only, the most significant cardiac complication is congestive heart - failure due to cardiomyopathy [64]. Even if all studies of cardiotoxicity of anthracycline detect a relationship with cumulative dose, even lower exposure is associated with toxicity with long enough follow -up time [65, 66] . Recent attempts at treatment -reduction in protocol randomised patients detectable MRD [less than 0\u00b701%] at day 29 that became undetectable by we ek 11) to receive or not receive a second delayed intensification (DI) block. Excellent overall outcome (EFS 95%) was observed. There was no difference in EFS or OS, but neither was there any difference in TRM between the randomised groups [12]. The DCOG10 study compared a cohort of low -risk patients defined by genetic - and MRD -criteria with historic controls and concluded that no significant difference in EFS could be shown and, importantly, although th ere was a numeric difference (93 vs 98%) in EFS in favour of the historic control, the OS of the DCOG10 SR -cohort was still 99% [13]. Similar results were obtained in a study from Singapore/Malaysia [67]. The fact that the results from UKALL and DCOG were similar, both in relative fraction of patients identified, but also in the general outcome despite ra ther different treatment -approaches, suggests that a substantial part of the therapy for these low - risk patients may be redundant and opens the possibility to further reduce the therapy. These results are seemingly contradicted by results from the BFM -group, which also tried a modest de -intensification in the BFM -2000 protocol for patients that were MRD -negative at the end of induction and consolidation [48] and found a higher event -rate, but not a significantly different overall survival in the de -intensified group. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 47 An important difference between the UKALL/DCOG and the BFM -studies was the higher fraction of patients assessed as MRD -negative in the BFM -materi al. It was also noted by the BFM that the difference in relapses was not detectable among patients who were treated with Dexamethasone in induction, which was randomised against Prednisolone in induction in their study. Hypothesis: Despite some discrepan cies between the published studies, we find these results encouraging and hypothesi se that these patients - without detectable MRD at the end of induction and additionally selected by genetic group - may safely (without significant reduction in DFS) be tre ated with decreased treatment -intensity. Specific objective linked to this hypothesis: To reduce the rate of serious toxicity, including treatment -related infections hopefully reducing the risk of TRM, we propose the randomised omission of anthracycline during the DI -phase of the therapy in this group. Even if it will be difficult to show this during the limited follow -up time of the study, the omission of anthracycline will also prevent potential anthracycline -induced late effects on the heart by the crea tion of sizeable sub -groups of patients who will not be exposed to anthracyclines at all. Figure 3. II DC=Delayed intensification with anthracycline (IR). II/II C=Delayed intensification without anthracycline (SR and second DI IR). 5.4 Rationale and Specific Objectives for the randomised omission of anthracycline in the delayed intensification or Vincristine - Dexamethasone pulses in maintenance in the IR - low group (R2) Pulses with Vincristine and Dexamethasone have been used since the late 1970s after initial findings of benefit in lower -risk patients [68]. A number of studies have followed resulting in two meta -analyses and a large collaborative I -BFM study with partly conflicting results [69-71]. Generally, the earlier studies, with lower intensity, less sophisticated stratification and worse overall resul ts show a benefit in EFS whereas more recent studies show smaller or no differences. A benefit in OS has been difficult to establish overall. A recent study from the EORTC showed benefit in patients with IKZF1 -deletion [72], but the se results were contradicted by a study including IKZF1 -analysed patient s in the I -BFM -trial [73]. The ongoing UKALL2011 trial is randomising the removal of pulses from MRD low and intermediate risk patients. This removal drastically reduces the cumulative exposure to ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 48 Dexamethasone and Vincristine with obvious potential benefit to neurological, metabolic and social function as well as future bone health. The novel approach to risk -stratification used in the ATP, integrating MRD -values as a continuous variable coupled with genetic sub -group (see below) identifies a second category of patients with excellent outcome similar to the SR -group and, in case of the UK patients, mostly identical therapy adding to the impression that elements of therapy may be redundant also for these patients. This group corresponds to the IR - low group, which has also been assessed as candidates for de -escalation. The first part of the de -escalation in this group will be the randomised omission of anthracycline in the DI -phase analogous to the SR-group. These IR -low patients have an excellent EFS, but the absolute majority of these patients have achieved these results on protocols including at least five VCR -dexa pulses - many of them have had pulses throughout maintenance. However, given the questionable benefit of pulses in the context of modern, highly intensive chemotherapy based on MRD -stratification and the indication that a possible benefit may be confined to a biological sub -group stratified to higher risk -groups, removal of pulses wil l be the second de -escalation randomised question in the IR -low group of ALLTogether. For the IR -low create a 2x2 factorial -Dexamethasone pulses durin g maintenance. Many of these patients will be young children belonging to the bulk of lower -risk leukaemias. Acceptance of randomisation to treatment de -intensification has been observed to be lower for this category of patients [74]. In order not to increase the risk of failure too much and to jeopardise recruitment, the permutation with double de-intensification (without anthracycline/without pulses) will be omitted, creating a 3 - way randomisation testing if a treatment -reduction of either anthracycline or Vincristine -Dexamethasone pulses is safe while maintaining antileukaemic Hypothesis: We hypothesise that patient identified as IR -low based on a combination of genetic and MRD -stratification characteristics may safely be treated with decreased treatment -intensity. Specific objective linked to this hypothesis: To reduce the rate of serious toxicity, including treatment -related infections hopefully reducing the risk of TRM as well as the detrimental effects on neurological, metabolic, psychiatric and bone function while maintaining antileukaemic activity, we propose the randomised omission o f anthracycline during the DI -phase and of Vincristine -Dexamethasone pulses in maintenance in a factorial design omitting the double de -intensification possibility. The omission of anthracycline also in the IR - group will increase the sub -groups of patients who will not be exposed to anthracyclines at all and may thus contribute to less cardiac long -term effects. 5.5 Rationale and Specific Objectives for the addition of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin (InO) for B -cell precursor patients with IR -high stratification - char acteristics CD22 is expressed on the cell surface of the majority of B -cell malignancies, including B -cell precursor (BCP) ALL in children and young adults. InO is as an antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a monoclonal CD22 - targeted antibody linked to calicheamicin, which is a potent cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic. Once the monoclonal antibody -drug conjugates to the tumor antigen, the ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 49 antigen -antibody co mplex is internalised and the cytotoxic agent is delivered inside the targeted leukemic cells. InO has shown clinical activity in ALL: In a phase 2 study in predominantly adult relapsed/refractory ALL, 19% of the patients achieved a CR, 30% had a CRp (com plete response without platelet recovery), and 9% had a CRi (complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery), resulting in an overall response of 58% to InO. A lower dose and more frequent dosing -schedules of the drug, may improve anti -ALL activit y and reduce toxicity compared to single -course dose [75, 76]. A phase I/II single -agent InO trial (B1931010) was conducted in adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. CR or CRi was achieved across all InO dose levels with a hematological remission rate of 68.1%. The MTD was not reached but the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was determined to be 1 .8 mg/m2/cycle administered every 3 -4 weeks. InO was generally well tolerated in these 72 adult patients [75, 77] . An open -label, randomised phase III trial (B1931022) of weekly InO versus standard intensive chemotherapy (FLAG), or cytarabine p lus mitoxantrone, or high-dose cytarabine has been conducted in adult patients with refractory and relapsed ALL. With 218 of 326 randomised patients included in the efficacy analysis, preliminary results showed that CR/CRi rate, duration of remission and M RD negativity rates were significantly greater in the InO -arm compared with standard intensive chemotherapy (CR 80.7% vs 29.4%). Among the patients who had CR, a higher percentage in the InO group had results below the threshold for MRD (0.01% marrow blast s) (78.4% vs. 28.1%). Both PFS and OS were longer with InO [78]. In elderly patients InO has been administered in upfront ALL treatment in combination with a low -intensity chemotherapy (mini -hyperCV AD: cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone/ methotrexate and c ytarabine). Preliminary results has been presented at ASH 2016 showing better responses (CR 84%, CRp 12%, Cri 2%, ORR 98%) compared to the regimen and high MRD negativity rates of 96% [79]. A phase I/II trial in children with R/R BCP -ALL is currently conducted (ITCC -059). The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions are hematologic toxicities (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). Hematologic toxicity occurred more frequently in patients who received InO in combination with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Other common adverse events reported were hepatic toxic ities (liver enzyme elevations and sinusoidal obstruction a. veno -occlusive disease (VOD) [80]. SOS/VOD is almost only seen in patients who have undergone allo-SCT before InO -therapy [78]. In a retrospective study including 51 heavily pretreated pediatric relapsed/refractory ALL patients treated with InO by compassionate use, the incidence of grade 3/4 hepatic toxicity was 1 2%. SOS was only seen in the pediatric patients who underwent HSCT after InO, the majority of these patients had 1 or more prior HSCT as well [81]. Based on the results of previous protocols the intermediate risk group is d ivided into two sub -groups according to MRD results. The patients with positive MRD at end of Consolidation I (ALLTogether protocol day 71) have significantly worse outcome than the intermediate risk patients with negative MRD at day 71. By combining MRD results at TP1 with high risk genetic parameters these two groups could be separated in an IR -high and IR -low group with a 5 years EFS of 81,9% an d 94,1% respectively . The relatively high relapse -risk and the substantial fraction of patients stratified to t he IR-high group means that approximately 60% of all relapses is estimated to occur in this group if no intervention is made. Therefore, the IR -high group should have access to new drugs to improve their outcome and/or decrease toxicity. Patients with ABL-class fusions (tyrosine kinase activating alterations) potentially sensitive to TKIs, will receive Imatinib and are not eligible for randomisation, but they account for only 1-2 % of the BCP -ALL patients. For the remaining patients a randomised investigati onal window in which the addition of novel agents treatment strategies can be tested is planned between delayed intensification and maintenance. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 50 Hypothesis: We hypothesise that BCP -patients identified as IR -high based on a combination of genetic and MRD -stratification may benefit from the addition of InO to the therapy by a reduction of the relapse -rate. Specific objective linked to this hypothesis: To reduce the relapse -rate in the IR -high group while keeping the toxic end -points well under control, res ulting in an increase in the DFS as well as survival of these patients. 5.6 Rationale and Specific Objectives for the non - randomised addition of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to patients carrying in the leukaemic clo ne: NRI1 Several years ago gene expression profiling (GEP) studies identified a novel subgroup of ALL which had a GEP resembling that seen in BCR -ABL1 positive patients but occurred in patients lacking the fusion. It was termed BCR -ABL1 -like or Philadelphia -like AL BCP -ALL [82, 83] . of BCR -ABL1 -like patients harboured recurrent genetic lesions affecting genes are now termed ABL -class (Table X) because the resulting fusion has similar functional consequences to the canonical BCR -ABL1 fusion i.e. deregulation of tyrosine kinase activity. Studies have found that patients with ABL -class fusions have high levels of MRD post induction and a significantly higher relapse risk compared with other BCP - ALL patients [52, 84] . This association with poor outcome was mirrored in the data pooled from 31 patients harbouring ABL -class fusions and tre ated on historic UK, DCOG and Co ALL protocols. None of the patients had undetectable MRD at the end of induction; in contrast, 74% had MRD>1%. The outcome of all these ABL -class fusion patients was poor with 11/23 (48%) patients with MRD>1% suffering induction failure or relapse and 3/8 (38%) of the remaining patients relapsing. There is g rowing in vitro , in vivo , ex vivo and clinical evidence that patients harbouring one of these ABL-class fusions are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors e.g. Imatinib and Dasatinib [85]. This evidence includes reports of patients with refractory disease at the end of induction achieving complete remission after treatment with a TKI [86, 87] . Several clinical study groups (e.g. COG [84, 88] ) have altered their frontline p rotocols to identify these patients rapidly and add a TKI to these children's therapy. In UKALL2011, patients with high MRD (>1%) at the end of induction are screened for ABL-class fusions and, if present, are treated with Imatinib in addition to standard chemotherapy [52, 89] . A large intergroup study of children with BCR -ABL1 + ALL showed that the addition of Imatinib to an intensive chemotherapy regimen improved disease free survival by ~20% compared with historical coh orts [90]. There is also evidence that adding a TKI during induction is more beneficial than later on [91]. Patients with identified lesions targetable by TKIs have thus so far been identified mostly as cases with a Philadelphia+ -like expression profile, poor initial response to therapy, high MRD and with relatively poor prognosis [51, 82, 84] . These patients are included in the overall study and stratified according to modified response criteria in the protocol but will (if <25 years at diagnosis) be treated with a TKI introduced during the induction phase (or after induction if 25 years) in an attempt to improve their MRD -response and their hitherto poor outlook. Since they form a small, biologically separate sub -group, they will be excluded from all randomised studies. Since d ata regarding these relative ly rare patients is systematically collected prospectively, it will also be possible to collect and analyse data across collaborative ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 51 group s in the future. 5.7 Rationale and Specific Objectives for the non - randomised selection of B -cell precursor high -risk patients to become eligible for experimental therapy with chimeric antigen receptor T -cell (CAR -T) therapy Patients stratified into the high risk group are at high risk of relapse and need intensive chemotherapy blocks, often followed by allo -HSCT, which i s associated with a risk of acute and long -term morbidity and mortality. A study including data from 14 international cooperative study groups worldwide showed that patients not achieving remission after induction chemotherapy had a survival rate <50% [27]. A recent UK study confirme d this poor outcome [89]. In addition to patients not achieving CR after induction, patients with measurable residual disease (MRD) after the first consolidation course also have poor prognosis. A Children's Oncology Group (COG AALL0232) study showed a 5 -year DFS <50% in B-lineage ALL patients who had MRD the end of induction (EOI) and MRD 0.01% at the end of consolidation (EOC) [23]. In the Dutch DCOG10 trial [13], intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with MRD > 0.05% EOI and EOC resulted in a 5 -year EFS rate of 78% (SE 8%), however, with high treatment related morbidity. A recent meta -analysis including >11.000 paediatric ALL patients and >2000 adult ALL patients confirmed the poor outcome of patients with high MRD load at EOI [92]. The optimal treatment for high risk ALL patients with persistent MRD at EOI and EOC is unknown. The current therapies involve very intensive chemotherapy courses (block therapy) most often followed by allogenic HSCT. Block therapy and allo -HSCT are associated with a 10 -20% treatment -related mortality as well as significant morbidity including GVHD, secondary malignancies, osteonecrosis, infertility and neurocognitive deficiencies. Clearly, it is highly desirable to develop safer, more effective nove l therapies for patients with high risk ALL that avoid the short -term mortality and late effects of block therapy and HSCT. There are two approaches proposed to such high risk patients in the ALL Together -1 study. The first approach involves screening of all patients for ABL -class abnormalities and adding a tyrosine kinase inhibitor during induction to those patients in which ABL class abnormalities are detected; these patients may benefit from TKI therapy and reduce MRD by the end of induction. The second approach restricted to high risk B precursor ALL without an ABL -class abnormality is immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. CAR -T cell therapy involves autologous T -cells genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (C AR). The CAR construct consists of sequences that encode the single -chain variable fragment (svFc) of a monoclonal antibody linked to T-cell signalling domains. CARs designed to target CD19 are specifically recognizing B-cells, as the expression of CD19 is restricted to normal B -cells and malignant cells deriving from normal B -cells (except myeloma). In 2018, results from two different independent anti -CD19 CAR -T cell therapies in refractory/relapsed (r/r) B -ALL were published back to back in the New Englan d Journal of Medicine [93, 94] ; the global multicenter registration trial ELIANA for pediatric/young adults patients, and a single center trial from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for adult patients. At last update from ELIANA (Grupp, Blood 2018; 132 (Suppl 1)), relapse -free survival of responding patients and overall survival of all infused patients 24 -months after a single CAR -T cell infusion with the Novartis product Tisagenlecleucel were 62% and 66%, respectively. In addition, Tisagenlecleucel showed long term persistence in some of the infused patients. Major but transient and manageable side effects of CAR -T cell therapy include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. B ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 52 cell aplasia as an on -target toxicity is seen as long as the CAR -T cells persist. Based upon the imp ressive results in r/r B -ALL, a phase II trial of Tisagenlecleucel in first - line high -risk B -lineage ALL with high MRD at EOC has started (CTL019G2201J CASSIOPEIA study, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03876769) in which several collaborative groups of t he ALLTogether consortium participate. Currently, only one CAR -T cell trial will be open for HR patients from ALLTogether1: CASSIOPEIA which was initiated in 2018 in selected study centres of the ALLTogether1 study group . If other CAR -T products should bec ome available for use in first -line high risk B -lineage ALL, patients may be included in studies with these and provisions for these may be added by amendment . For eligibilty criteria for the CASSIOPEIA trial, see section on CAR -T therapy . Treatment with CAR -T cells may help to avoid the toxicities associated with intensive chemotherapy and allo -HSCT. The use of CAR -T cells constitutes the end of therapy and will not be followed by allo -HSCT as long as the patients remains in remission after CAR -T cell the rapy. It is anticipated that treating patients with CAR -T cells in the MRD setting may lead to a more favourable safety profile than that reported in r/r B - ALL, as higher disease burden at CAR -T infusion is a major risk factor for CRS. It is also anticipat ed that the lower incidence of CRS will in turn lead to a lower incid ence of neurological toxicity. 5.8 Additional, tertiary, exploratory objectives 1. To form a comprehensive master protocol for treatment of ALL in children and young adults using the experience of several leading study -groups in the field in Western Europe with the view to both improve the overall leukaemia - specific outcome as well as to create a basis for research into the specifics of treatment , disease biology including translational aspects. We aim to make this master protocol a dynamic platform by making interventions \"modular\" and possible to \"plug -in\" and stop independently of each other. 2. To increase the statistical power of the consortium by the joining together of different study -groups, thereby increasing the recruitment greatly. This increase in statistical power is essential, because of the ever increasing identification of new biological sub -groups, that increase the demand for patien t-numbers in sub -group analyses as well as in potential intervention . 3. To improve the stratification of patients by the use of combined clinical, genetic and MRD -data, specifically improving the MRD -based stratification by the combined use of PCR - as well as flow -cytometry (FCM) based techniques. Thresholds for MRD cut -offs will partly be determined by genetic group, using on a novel model based on pooled data from the study -groups in the consortium. 4. To evaluate the performance of the master protocol that w ill apply a novel system for risk -stratification as well as a new standard of care (SOC) for risk - adapted therapy. The overall results need to be compared with historic controls to ensure that the novel stratification -system and the proposed interventions do not cause the overall results to deteriorate. The evaluation of overall results is also important to ascertain the outcome of patients that for a variety of reasons (demographic or leukaemia subtype, ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 53 toxicity, personal preference) were not included in the randomised or non - randomised interventions. 5. To include both children and young adults in the same treatment protocol to better understand the impact of age on risk -stratification, tolerance to therapy as well as leukaemia -specific outcomes and toxicit y. 6. To include QoL -measurements in the standard evaluation of ALL -therapy both for this trial and for future reference, since the majority of patients will survive, a fraction of patients are over -treated and a significant number of survivors suffer from to xicity both short - and long -term. 7. To use therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Asparaginase -activity SOC to allow for the rational replacement of Pegylated Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) in the case of silent inactivation and for assessment of allergic -like reactio ns to PEG -Asp. 8. To evaluate the impact of measured Asp -activity on both leukaemia -specific outcomes as well as on toxicity. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 54 6. IMPORTANT DEFINITION S 6.1 Diagnosis of ALL ALL constitutes the expansion of leukaemic lymphoblasts in the bone -marrow above 25% of the nucleated cell content [95]. A tentative diagnosis is usually made by bone -marrow aspiration an d cytomorphological examination of bone -marrow smears. The diagnosis has to be confirmed by immunological methods, usually by flow - cytometry. In cases where adequate aspirates are difficult to obtain due to \"dry tap\", a trephine biopsy may be used, with co nfirmation by immune -cytology performed on touch -preparations or immunohistochemistry on biopsy -material . In exceptional cases, when a bone -marrow diagnosis cannot be obtained because of poor clinical condition, ALL may be diagnosed by the detection of >30 % leukaemic cells in the peripheral blood, confirmed by flow -cytometry [96, 97] . The immunological investigation may be supported by the detection of leukaemia -specific findings by genetic analys es. 6.2 Definitions relating to Treatment -failures and the Definition of Leukemi a-associated Adverse Events (LAEs) It is important to make distinctions and record if the treatment -failure is due to under - treatment, in which case the treatment -failure is principally due to the disease, or over-treatment, where the management or therapy is the cause . Over -treatment may be, but is not always, associated with treatment -related mortality (TRM). The definition of TRM in the protocol is consistent with the definitions in (Alexander et al, Lancet Oncology 2015) [98], but adding death after Second Malignant Neoplasm as TRM (see bel ow). The following LAE s are traditionally considered: Disease that is r esistant to protocol therapy - in ALLTogether called Protocol Therapy Failure (PTF) Induction death (Death after therapy start, but before first remission -ID) Relapse (Rel) Death in first complete re mission (DCR1) and Second malignant neoplasm (SMN) To make the evaluation of manag ement complete the following event has been added: Death before therapy (DBT) In the event -free survival analysis all of the above events are considered. The randomised studies only includes patients who are in complete remission at the time of inclusion and the EFS -analysis after randomisation thus only incl udes Rel, DCR1 and SMN as events - usually referred to as disease -free survival (DFS) . Death before therapy (DBT) DBT occurs if the patient has been diagnosed with ALL and has consented to participation but has not received any antileukaemic therapy (steroids or chemotherapeutic agents) at the time of death. DBT is considered as TRM and is an ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 55 under -treatment event in the intention -to-treat analysis, but may be excluded from the evaluation of the protocol in a per protocol analysis, since it does not reflect the protocol design, but the severity of the disease and the acute management of an individual patient. BM-remission/BM Protocol Therapy Failure (BM P TF) In the ATP, response -assessment of the bone -marrow is performed by PCR - and/or FCM MRD -methodology. Remission is considered achieved when the leukaemic cell burden has been reduced to < 1% by one or both methods (highest value applies) and the patient fulfils the starting criteria for continued therapy according to the protocol. Only in the rare event that neither PCR -based MRD -methods nor FCM can be applied to detect 1% remaining disease will morphology be used to determine if remission has been achieved. M1 (<5% blasts by cytomorphology) will then be considered as the response - prerequisite for complete remission, whereas M2 (5 -25% blasts by cytomorphology) or M3 ( 25% blasts by cytomorphology) is considered as non -remission/remaining leukaemic state. Most of the stratification is based on lower MRD -values (see below). Patients with remaining disease 1% in the bone -marrow (by MRD -techniques - or if these fail, 5% by cytomorphology) after induction, consolidation 1 and 3 HR -blocks is considered as Protocol Therapy Failure (leukaemic adverse event). They are taken off protocol and may be eligible for cli nical trials for resistant ALL. The same applies if the patient is stratified to allo geneic HSCT and the MRD after initial HR -therapy (3 HR-blocks) is not ac ceptable for HSCT. Such a patient should be considered as BM PTF and be made available for alternative intervention before HSCT. 6.2.2.1 Refractory T -cell disease Patients with T -cell disease are defined as refractory to standard therapy if - MRD at the end of induction (day 29) is 5% and day 50 is 5% or - MRD at the end of induction (day 29) is 5% and day 71 is 0.01% or - MRD at the end of induction (day 29) is <5% but MRD day 71 is 0.05% Refractory T -cell disease is not considered an LAE, but define s refractoriness to standard therapy motivating the use of Nelarabine within the label of this compound in the ALLTogether protocol (see below) . Definition of CNS -status and non-traumatic lumbar puncture, 5 WBC/ LCSF leukaemic cells leukemic cells/slide by morphology (cyt ospin). If possible, confirmation cytometry/genetic analysis. CNS3: non-traumatic puncture, > 5 WBC/ L CSF with identifiable leukemic cells (cytospin) . If possible, confirmation by flow cytometry/genetic analysis. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 56 TLP+: traumatic puncture with identifiable leukemic cells (cytospin) . If possible, confirmation by flow cytometry/genetic analysis. TLP-: traumatic puncture without leukemic cells by cytospin. Visible cells may be evaluated and assessed as non/leukaemic by FCM, in which case the patien t is TLP-. A traumatic lumbar puncture (TLP) is defined as 10 or more erythrocytes/ L CSF or as CSF macroscopically contaminated with blood. CNS involvement /slow or mass/meningeal enhancement compatible with CNS - leukaemia on MRI or Retinal involvement by fundoscopy or TLP(+) and >5 white cells/microL in the CSF or Slow response CNS2 with no clearance of blasts by d15 or Slow response TLP(+) with no clearance of blasts by d15. Definition of CNS -remission and -remission CNS -remission in the CSF is defined as no blasts in 2 consecutive CSF samples by cytospin. Visible cells may be evaluated by FCM. Normalisation/Absence of clear evidence of persistent disease on MRI . Regression of retinal involvement by fundoscopy . Patients with CNS -involvement by clinical symptoms are assessed clinically. Improvement is considered sufficient if adequate BM -response and MRI -changes have r egressed, since neurological deficits may take a long time to normalise . Patients with MRI -findings are assessed by MRI at the end of Consolidation 1 at the latest [99]. 6.2.4.2 CNS Protocol Therapy Failure (CNS PTF) Patients with remaining detectable leukaemic cells by cytospin at the end of induction enter standard Consolidation 1 therapy and receive continued weekly IT therapy. CNS -resistant disease (leukaemic adverse event) is diagnosed if the CSF is still positive by cytospin at the end of Consolidation 1. Confirmation by alternative methods ( FCM/ immune -cytology/genetic analyses should be carried out if possible). CNS Protocol Therapy Failure on clinical grounds is diagnosed if CNS -symptoms persist unchanged or increase and/or if MRI -findings are unchanged or increase by the end of Consolidation 1. These are expected to be rare cases, which should be referred for centr al review by the A LLTogether protocol reference group for protocol events . CNS P TF is considered a leukaemic adverse event. Such patients are taken off protocol and may be eligible for other clinical trials for resistant ALL or for supplementation of the therapy with CNS -irradiation or other interventions . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 57 Definition of Testicular involvement, testicular remission and Testicular Protocol Therapy Failure (Testicular P TF) Unilateral or bilateral testiculomegaly at diagnosis constitutes tentative testicular involvement of ALL. Testicular infiltration should be confirmed by ultrasound (for subsequent follow -up), but a biopsy should not be performed at diagnosis. Rapidly responding testicular disease has no consequences for stratification, but patients who do not have complete response by the end of induction (by bilateral ultrasound) cannot be stratified to the SR-group. The patient should at the latest be assessed by ultrasound at the end of Consolidation 1. Biopsy is indicated if the patient at that time po int still has testiculomegaly or suspicion of leuk aemic infiltration by bilateral ultrasound. Biopsy -proven leuk aemic infiltration at that time -point will re -stratify the patient to high-risk therapy. Ultrasound is repeated after each block and a new biopsy is indicated after three high -risk blocks have been administered (A, B and C). Biopsy - proven leukemic infiltration at that time -point is regarded as Protocol Therapy Failure (Testicular P TF). The patient is taken off protocol and may be eligible for clinical trials for resistant ALL. Definition of Mediastinal mass, Mediastinal mass remission assessment and Mediastinal mass Protocol Therapy Failure (Med mass P TF) Mediastinal mass is defined as a mass of > 1/3 the thoracic diameter at the level of the 5th thoracic vertebra. The baseline extent of the mediastinal tumour should be explored by MRI/CT when it is assessed as medically safe to do so without risk. In rapidly responding patients the mediastinal mass has no consequences for stratification, b ut patients who do not have complete response by radiology at the end of induction (normal appearance on MRI/CT) cannot be stratified to the SR- group. In practice this will be rare, since most cases will be of T -cell immunophenotype, which is excluded from SR-stratification anyway. If mediastinal mass occurs in a BCP -patient, this finding disqualifies the patient from SR stratification. Reductio n of the mass to <1/3 of its initial volume is considered \"remission\", but any remaining mass at the end of Consolidation 1 will stratify the patient to at least IR - high. Remaining mass 1/3 of the original volume at the end of Consolidation 1 will stratif y the patient to HR and remaining mass 1/3 of the original volume after induction, Consolidation 1 and 3 HR -blocks should be worked up with PET -CT and/or biopsy. Evidence of v iable tumour at that point is Protocol Therapy Failure and an adverse leukaemic event in the EFS -analysis . The patient is taken off protocol and may be eligible for clinical trials for resistant ALL. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 58 Death after initiation of therapy, but before first complete remission - Induction death (ID) 6.2.7.1 Induction death with remaining disea se (IDr) IDr is defined as a death occurring during protocol therapy, before remission is achieved and before the patient is classified as Protocol Therapy Failure (induction, consoli dation, and 3 high-risk blocks) , but where the latest evaluation of the bone - marrow status during therapy or an evaluable examination after death of bone - marrow, or of other sites, demonstrates a lack of complete response (by histo - morphology). This is also true if the patient dies before the first bone -marrow evaluation, but after the initiation of antileukaemic therapy. For patients with extensive complications and a long time -span between the last bone -marrow evaluation and death, post mortem assessment of the bone -marrow is encouraged. Can the bone -marrow not be assessed af ter death, the last bone -marrow assessment counts. IDr is an under -treatment event and is included in the TRM definition. 6.2.7.2 Induction death with complete response (IDcr) IDcr is defined as a death occurring during protocol induction therapy (including high - risk blocks if response to initial induction was poor) and where the last evaluation of the bone -marrow status, on day 15, 29, 71 or subsequently after high -risk blocks or an evaluable bone -marrow puncture after death ind icates a complete response ( <1% leukaemic cells in the bone -marrow) to induction therapy without recovery of peripheral blood counts. IDcr should be classified as over -treatment and also as TRM. Definition of Relapse of ALL (Rel) A relapse has occurred if there is definitive evidence of the reappearence of leukaemic cells in the bone marrow or the renewed detection of malignant cells in any extramedullary site after complete remission has been achieved. Relapse is an under -treatment event and any death after relapse cannot be considered a s TRM. The detection of 1% blasts in the bone marrow (confirmed to represent leukaemic cells by two independent techniques - flow cytometry/molecular MRD/leukaemia - specific genetic markers) in two repeated samples 1 -4 weeks apart OR If no MRD -/genetic markers are availab le, 25% blasts in the bone -marrow (M3) by morphology alone after complete remission has been achieved. CNS relapse: The detection of 5 blasts /micro L in the spinal fluid on cytospin preparations (confirmed to represent leukemic cells b y flow cytometry and/or detection of leukaemica -specific genetic markers) or CNS leukemia (on MRI or CT) confirmed histologically, after complete remission has been achieved. Testicular relapse: Testicular enlargement confirmed to contain leukaemic cells in a biopsy tested by flow cytomet ry and/or detection of leukaemi a-specific genetic markers , after complete remission has been achieved Relapse in other extramedullary site: The detection of leukaemic cells by flow cytometry and/or detection of leukaemi a-specific genetic markers at any other site after complete remission has been achieved. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 59 At the time of relapse, full work -up with history, physical examination, radiological assessment as indicated and lumbar puncture should be performed. T he relapse is classified as: Isolated to bone -marrow if no extramedullary leukaemic manifestations can be found Isolated CNS -, testis - or other extramedullary if the bone -marrow involvement is <5% Combined if bone -marrow relapse is combined with at least one extramedullary manifestation Death in First Complete Remission (DCR1) DCR1 is defined as death without evidence of ALL, occurring after the patient has achieved a first complete remission (CR) according to the definition s above. All deaths in CR should be assessed for likely causality. If the assessment is that the death may have been, at least partly, caused by the therapy (DCR1t), the DCR1 is classified as an over - treatment event and is considered as TRM. If the evidence suggests that the death is comple tely unrelated to the therapy (unrelated accidents etc - DCR1u), the patient should be censored at the time of death and the event should be considered as neither an over - nor under -treatment event. Second malignant neoplasm (SMN) SMN is defined as a conf irmed diagnosis of an malignant neoplasm unrelated to the initial malignant clone after the initial diagnosis of ALL. The unrelatedness should always be assessed. For haematological malignancies it may take extensive measures (analyses of immunophenotype, genotype and rearrangements of immunoglobulins or T -cell receptors) to distinguish an SMN from a relapse of ALL. A confirmed diagnosis of an SMN is considered as over -treatment, but only deaths resulting from the SMN diagnosis itself should be considered a s TRM. The final decision should be taken by a reference group from the steering -committee. Table 5. Leukaemic Adverse events and their relation to over - and under - treatment and TRM.

Both PCR and FCM -techniques will be used for MRD -detection. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 60 Definition of quantitative range (reproducible sensitivity) and sensitivity of MRD -PCR targets The reproducible sensitivity (also called quantitative range) and sensitivity are defined according to the guide lines of the European Study Group for MRD detection in ALL (ESG -MRD -ALL). The guidelines for interpretation of the RQ -PCR results (positivity, negativity, background, correction of results according to control gene, etc.) are according to the ESG -MRD -ALL. Standard curves for quantitation are based on duplicate dilution steps of the original patient material at diagnosis. Follow -up samples will be analy sed in triplicate for each MRD -PCR target. The original material is calibrated by comparison with the FCM -analysis of sample so that 10% disease on the molecular dilution curve equates to exactly 10% leukaemic cell DNA. Definition of undetectable MRD - (threshold for SR- stratification) by PCR: No positive signal detected in any of three 600ng patient DNA replicate samples per target, analysed by a target with a minimum QR of 0.01%. Ideally two targets are to be used, one with QR of 0.01%, the other with QR of 0.05%, but if there is only one suitable target such patients can be allocated to the SR arm. by FCM: Less than 10 events in the targeted Leukaemia -Associated Immuno - Phenotype (LAIP) detected following acquisition of a minimum of 4 million total events. NB! It is n ot possible to label T -cell patients as \" undetectable \" by FCM. Definition of cut -offs for HR -stratific ation by PCR: Lower sensitivity targets may be used, since this will not lead to mis - classification. by FCM: Informative immunophenotype (Stratification to the HR -group by FCM is acceptable as long as the markers used are assessed as informative (adequate LAIP). MRD 5% at TP1 For target with a reproducible sensitivity 0.05% required. For T -cell patients: MRD at - See definition of MRD above. by FCM: Sensitivity of at least 0.05% with an adequate LAIP for B -precursor patients. NB! It is not possible to allocate T -cell patients to IR -low BTG1 ; or ETV6 deletion with a single deletion of BTG1, PAX5, CDKN2A/B. ALLTogether Protocol Poor Risk\" (CNA PR) = Copy -number alteration poor -risk - all other patterns - not eligible for IR -low stratification . MRD undetectable at TP2 if T -cell ALL Definition of failed mandatory genetic work -up All patients must tested for BCR -ABL1 fusion [t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), Philadelphia chromosome] by FISH and/or RT -PCR. Patients positive for BCR -ABL1 fusion are ineligible for the study . A patient without a valid result is not eligible to continue as a protocol patient and thus cannot be included in any of the randomisations. The therapy may continue according to the protocol as standard of care . Failure to exclude all mandatory HR -genetic markers genetic work -up failure. NB! The presence of canonical abnormalities such as ETV6 -RUNX1 fusion, high hype rdipoidy and t(1;19)(q23;p13)/ TCF3 -PBX1 is sufficient to exclude the presence of HR genetics in the absence of specific tests. Patients with failed genetic work -up should be stratified to the IR-high group; unless they are classified as HR by MRD Failure to exclude a poor -risk CNA -profile before time point 2 will also be considered genetic work -up failure and will result in IR -high stratification, unless ETV6 -RUNX1 fusion or high hyperdiploidy been verified, in which case MRD -stratification is performe d according to the guidelines for these genetic sub -groups. Definition of failed MRD -stratification MRD -stratification failure is diagnosed if, for whatever reason (failure to obtain sample or technical difficulties with the analyses), an MRD -result for t he time -point in question of sufficient quality (including insufficient quantitative range for PCR or lacking informativeness for the FCM -analysis) can be obtained. NB! The requirements for the stratification become more stringent the lower the risk - group - see details in threshold definitions above. For instance, it may be possible to exclude HR -stratification by MRD -techniques, but impossible to stratify the patient further, in which case the patient is stratified to the IR -high group. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 62 7. OUTCOME MEASURES AND END -POINTS The ALLTogether Protocol is a synthesis of the comprehensive systems for diagnosis, stratification and treatment of ALL in children and young adults developed by the participating study -groups. The synthesis in itself calls for evaluation of the overall re sults compared with the legacy -protocols of the study -groups and also forms the basis for comparisons with future versions of the platform or other study - groups. Since the protocol includes both small children, adolescents and young adults, all end poi nts will be analysed for the entire population as well as for the age groups 1 - 15.99y, 16 -24,99y and 25 -45y and comparisons will also be made between the age groups. 7.1 Primary end -point The primary end -point for the whole protocol in running evaluations wi ll be event -free survival (EFS). The EFS has the day of diagnosis as the start for the basic time -scale and the patients are followed until the time -point of the first leukaemic adverse event (see definitions below) or the end of follow -up (censored observ ation). The randomised interventions all only include patients in first complete remission (see definitions). They will have the date of randomisation as start of the basic time -scale and will have Disease -Free Survival (DFS) as primary end -points. 7.2 Secondary end -points The most important secondary outcome is overall survival (OS) which uses the day of diagnosis as starting point for evaluation o f the whole protocol population (analogous to the EFS analysis), but the time of randomisation is the star ting point for evaluation when patients in the randomised studies are analysed (analogous to the DFS analysis) . In these analyses the patient is followed until death or the end of follow -up. Addition al secondary measures of antileukaemic efficacy are: rat e of -death during induction, -resistant disease, cumulative incidence of: -relapse (ciR), -death in first complete remission (ciDCR1) and -second malignancy (ciSMN). Over - and under -treatment events will also be combined into resulting treatment - related mortality (TRM) and leukaemia specific mortality (LSM) rates. Since over -treatment also includes cured patients who suffer potentially permanent side-effects, data will be collected regarding the incidence of some adverse events of special interest (see below under the randomised studies and toxicity registration for details). Furthermore, de -escalation of therapy may result in relapses that have to be rescued with allogeneic stem -cell transplant (allo -SCT), which is associated with serious permanent sid e effects. Therefore, the incidence of allo -HSCT in CR1 and CR2 will also be measured. Continuous exposure to PEG -asparaginase and measurements of PEG -asp activity will be conducted to optimise asparaginase treatment. The exposure of asparaginase that is necessary for cure is not known. An important secondary end -point is to relate asparaginase -activity with antileukaemic - as well as toxicity outcomes. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 63 An important aspect of evaluation of the quality of survival is measurement of quality of life (QoL). T he whole protocol, as well as the non -randomised and randomised interventions will also be evaluated by such measurements - as a minimum by EQ5D -based instruments at regular intervals. More extensive QoL -measurements are optional and may be added later as add-on sub -studies. 7.3 Endpoints in the Randomised studies Primary end -point for R1 and R2 (de -escalation studies) Since patients in the randomised studies have to reach first complete remission to be eligible, all early events are excluded if the patient is eligible for the randomisation. Thus the primary end -point of the R1 and R2 randomisations is Disease -Free Survi val (DFS). The R1 and R2 randomisations have the aim to test de -escalation of therapy. The primary objective is to test if the experimental arm can safely omit anthracycline during DI (R1 and R2) or VCR -dexa pulses in Maintenance therapy (R2) aiming for a non-inferior DFS. DFS is a composite end -point consisting of relapse (Rel), death in first complete remission (DCR1) and second malignancy (SMN) with continuous complete remission as censored outcome. Events are expected late in these patient groups - thus, evaluation needs to be postponed to catch these late events. Evaluation of primary end -points will occur at the end of the pre -specified follow -up time (5 years recruitment and 5 years follow -up of the last patient recruited). 7.3.1.1 Sequence of assessmen t of success (R1 and R2) The studies are powered to answer the primary end -point non -inferiority question with a certain safety -margin. Even if reduction of exposure to potentially toxic therapy is an objective in itself, it is also reasonable to show som e immediately measurable benefit from the reduction of therapy if the study is successful and non -inferiority can be shown. However, many of the toxic outcomes are quite rare and some of them do not have adequate baseline data making it difficult to assess the power that would be associated with testing the randomised arms against each other, which means that particularly negative results will have to be interpreted with caution. If the criteria for non -inferiority of the primary end -point are met, the succ ess of the randomisations will be assessed by a hierarchical sequence of analyses among the parameters constituting the secondary end -points listed below: Overall Survival Disease -related vs treatment -related mortality Fraction of surviving patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplant in second remission Qualitative measures of non -lethal toxicity with potentially serious acute or long-term effects Quantifiable consequences of these toxicities in terms of cost and inconvenience (see below). Health -related QoL as a minimum, measured by EQ5D -based instruments. Evaluation of secondary end -points with comparison between the randomised arms will take place at the same time as for the primary end -points. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 64 However, pooled results of incidence of tox icities in risk -groups, without specification of randomised arms, may be assessed earlier (after full recruitment and recording of toxicity for the last patient included). 7.3.1.2 Rationale for choosing specific non - lethal toxicities as secondary end - points in R1 and R2 If non -inferiority of DFS can be established, it is not likely that overall survival or other leukaemic events will show a big difference. Since the overall relapse -rate is low and a majority of the patients eligible for the R1 and R2 are likely to have th eir relapses later than 36 months from diagnosis (62 - and 69% of the patient categories corresponding to SR- and IR -low patients in UKALL2003 respectively), the fraction of patients for which allogeneic stem -cell transplant is indicated is also expected to be low. Therefore, non -lethal toxicity is presumed to be of most interest as a secondary end-point. A number of toxicities will be periodically tested, but only a selection of those will \u00e1 priori be considered as secondary end -points in R1 and R2 based on the expected toxicity of the omitted drugs: For the omission of anthracyclin es in the DI -phase the focus will be on serious infections, a bdominal conditions, mucositis and cardiac toxicity. As indirect quantifiable measures of these toxic outcomes, days admitted to hospital, days on intravenous antibiotics, days on advanced antifungals and days on intravenous nutritional support will be collected. For the omission of Vincristine -dexa pulses in the maintenance phase, the focus will be on Vincristine -induc ed peripheral neurop athy, osteonecrosis and metabolic consequences steroid therapy. Secondary end -points R1 and R2 Antileukaemic activity vs potential treatment -related mortality and toxicity Overall survival (OS).

QoL will be measured by EQ5D -based instruments before (within 1 week of start) and after (within 1 week) of the end of the randomised phase as well as after subsequent treatment phases and after cessation of treatment (within a month from discontinuation). Primary end -point R3 - InO The primary end -point of the R3 randomisation is Disease -Free Survival (DFS), defined as the time between start of study treatment or control treatment and first event defined as relapse, d eath due to any cause and second malignancies. Events are expected much earlier for IR -high patients who also have a higher expected rate of relapse, meaning that leukaemic outcome data will mature relatively early. Evaluation of primary and secondary ef ficacy end -point is planned at the end of the pre -specified follow -up time (5 years of recruitment and 2 years of follow -up of the last patient recruited). However, with regard to the timing of the evaluation, the recruitment -phase should be 5 years regard less of if recruitment is faster than anticipated and is stopped before the 5 -year mark.

STUDY PLAN 8.1 Study design The ALLTogether treatment protocol is an international multi -centre prospective, open label study with several (phase III) randomised parts. The backbone of the protocol is the basis of a platform onto which several randomisations and other interventions are added when they are read y to start (Fig ure 4). Additional interventions may be added later by amendment. The study structure may be referred to as a master protocol forming the basis for modular interventions [101] . Figure 4. General layout of the Protocol as a basis for planned interventions and preparation for linked studies ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 68 8.2 Participating Countries and Study Centers The Master Protocol including one or several of the study specific interventions will be run by a consortium of study groups representing 14 European countries. The age groups and the number of centres from the study groups/countries are shown in Table 6. Table 6 (same as Table 3 in Synopsis) . Estimated total yearly recruitment and number of recruiting centres by age -group /study try. 1-18 1-18 1-18 20 16 DCOG The Netherlands 1-18 (106) - 1 - CoALL (n=90) Germany 1-18 (90) - 7 - BSPHO (n=80) Belgium 1-18 (80) - 8 - SHOP (n=55) Portugal 1-18 (55) - 3 - ISPHO (n=42) Ireland (39) 18-24 (3) 1 7 SFCE (n=400) France 1-18 (400) - 28 The total recruitment over time and estimated stratification of patients are described in detail in a separate document and is not completely uniform over time, since all countries will not join the protocol from the outset. 8.3 Study Duration The recruitment time into the Master Protocol including the de -escalation randomisation R2 is estimated to six years. The interventions in R1 and the IR -high risk-group (R3 - InO) will have a shorter recruitment time of five years and the R3 - InO randomisation will have a minimum follow -up time of two years from inclusion . All other patients should be followed for at least f ive years from diagnosis. Thus, the total duration of the main protocol is eleven years. 8.4 Patient Populations Centres The centres participating in the Protocol and the randomised studies must be committed to follow the instructions given in the main protocol and to offer ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 69 participation in the randomised trials to their patients. For those patients, who are not randomised, it is recommended that they are treated according to the control arms. The centres are obliged to keep a pre -screening log of all patients diagnosed with ALL at their centre to ascertain the recruitment into the protocol compared with the eligible patient population.

Efficient birth control is required, see section 17.7. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 74 8.5 Background and Rationale for the Risk - Stratification Clinical factors as a basis for Treatment Stratification Modern treatment for ALL in children and young adults is based on risk -adapted stratification. Clinical risk -factors such as age, white blood cell count, immunophenotype and CNS -involvement have been in use to identify patients with higher or lower risk of relapse for decades [102-104]. These clinical features will still guide therapy for patients in the ALLTogether protocol. CNS -involvement as a basis for Treatment Stratification The impact of CNS leukemia (CNS3) at diagnosis as an independent risk factor for relapse has decreased but not totally vanished along with risk -adapted therapy. CNS leukemia is associated with other risk stratifying factors, such as high leukocyte count, T cell immunophenot ype, and high -risk cytogenetics. Complete remission rate, overall survival (OS), event -free survival (EFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse have shown to be similar in patients with or without CNS3 status at diagnosis, but the rate of isolated CNS relap ses has been higher in patients with CNS leukemia as compared to those without [105, 106] . Even though the majority of CNS -relapses of ALL are salvageable , the prognosis for early CNS relapse remains challenging [12]. In a univariate analysis of pooled data from the ATG consortium (UK, DCOG, NOPHO, CoALL ) we observed relapse vs. 10%, p<0.001 ) and relapse rate (7.6 vs <0.001 ) was higher in patients with CNS leukaemia (mostly CNS3) at diagnosis as compared to those without detectable involvement . With th ese data, given that all the groups had included extra intrathecal therapy to patients with CNS leukemia, CNS leukemia will remain as a stratifying risk factor by excluding these patients from the SR and IR -low group s in the protocol . The role of CNS2 status as a risk factor for relapse is less clear. Some reports have indicated no adverse outcome [107, 108] [109] , whereas others have shown an adverse effect [110] and also in one recent repor t, CNS2 status was associated with an increased relapse rate when no extra intrathecal therapy was administered [111] . So far, all the ATG groups contributing data (DCOG, UK, NOPHO, Co ALL) have given two extra intrathecals in induction to patients with CNS2 status at diagnosis. In a univariate analysis of data from the ATG consortium, we observed that CNS2 status was not a risk factor for overall relapse rate as compared to the CNS1 sta tus (11.0 vs 10.0%, p=0.201 ) and not associated with increased toxicity. Thus, in ALLTogether , extra intrathecal therapy will be given, but CNS2 will have no effect on systemic stratification. Traumatic lumbar puncture with leukaemic blasts (TLP+) has been associated wit h an increased relapse risk [107, 109, 112] a result that was repeated also in a recent study from the DCOG -group [13]. Furthermore, our pooled analysis showed that in practice a considerable fraction of patients with TLP+ and an elevated WBC in the CSF were stratified as CNS3 -patients. Thus, in the ALLTogether protocol TLP+ patients with an elevated WBC in the CSF will be excluded from the SR and the IR - low groups and patients with TLP+ without elevated WBC will be excluded from the SR-group. All patients with TLP+ will receive extra intrathecal therapy during induction. See also protocol section 10.3.2 (CNS therapy ) Figure 12 for CNS -stratification. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 75 Response to therapy as a basis for stratification (MRD) After initial retrospective findings of importance for risk -classification, measurable residual disease (MRD) has emerged as the most powerful tool for risk -classification [12, 13, 26, 113 -115], also confirmed by the study -groups in the ATC in recent prospective studies using the end of induction (Time -Point 1 - TP1) and end of first consolidation (Time -Point 2 - TP2) as the stratifying time -points [12, 13, 16, 25, 115] . In DCOG10 no further information was derived from the use of earlier or later time - points [13]. The prognostic significance of MRD is interconnected with the genetic subtype of ALL and needs to be interpreted in this context [116] . The effect of genetics is of particular importance in patients with intermediate prognosis by MRD analysis. 8.5.3.1 Molecular MRD for determin ation of the low risk threshold Molecular MRD analysis using quantitative PCR of Immunoglobulin and T -cell receptor gene rearrangements (Ig/TCR PQPCR) and performed according to Euro - MRD criteria [117] , is established as the most sensitive MRD assay currently in clinical use. Analysis of data from UKALL2003 clearly shows that MRD is a continuous variable, with the relapse rate falling with every log reduction in MRD at end of induction with no threshold t o this effect, except, importantly, the detection limit of the test (Table 7 and [116] ). The exact sensitivity of a given MRD test varies from patient to patient (and between targets within any patient), as each assay is patient specific. However, it is clear that patients with undetectable MRD (MRD assays with a minimum quantitative range of 0.01% that detect no amplification in all replicates of patient DNA tested) have the best prognosis, better than those where even a low -level signal below the quantitative range of the assay is seen (so called positive outside of quantitative range, POQ R). It is accepted that some of these POQR results will be false positives, but clarification of this point awaits the development of alternative assays such as Next Generation Sequencing based methodologies. Reassuringly, very similar outcomes for the MRD undetectable cohort can be seen in DCOG and BFM studies showing that this is a generalisable result [13, 113, 118] . Table 7. Analysis of outcome by End of Induction MRD level for patients on UKALL2003. Table taken from O'Connor et al [116] . All figures a re 5yr event rates. MRD level % of cases EFS RR OS Undetectable 28 95 4 99 <0.01% 33 92 6 96 0.01-<0.1% 21 88 8 93 0.1-<1% 12 78 16 86 1-<5% 4 72 20 80 >5% 3 42 51 57 RR=Relapse -risk Analysis within this MRD undetectable cohort shows no significant effect of genetics other than for high risk genetic lesions (Table 8 and[116] ). Thus, it was deter mined that MRD alone could determine entry into the lowest risk group. However, since patients with High risk genetic lesions have seldom been treated with lower -intensity therapy, they are excluded from this group in the ALLTogether protocol (see genetics section). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 76 Table 8. Analysis of the influence of genetics within the MRD undetectable cohort. (Note that high risk genetic lesions are excluded from this analysis as they are a priori excluded from the SR group.) CNA GR & CNA PR are copy number alteration (CNA) profiles associated with a good (GR) or poor (PR) risk. They are defined using the copy number status of eight distinct gene loci [1]. Total RR OS Relapse stage VE E=early (>18 months from diagnosis and <6 months after cessation of therapy) L=late (>6 months after cessation of therapy) 8.5.3.2 Flow Cytometry for evaluation of the low risk threshold Flow cytometric methods for MRD based risk stratification using Leukaemia Associated Immunophenotype (LAIP) or 'different from in common use [14, 119] . Flow cytometric analysis has the distinct advantage over molecular methods in that it has a much faster turnaround time (~ several hours vs 5 - 7 days minimum). However, historically flow MRD has been shown not to be as sensitive as molecular methods [120] and higher thresholds have therefore been used [14, 119] . However, recent developments in flow cytometric MRD analysis suggest that with a high enough event analysis ( >4 million) that equivalent sensitivities can be achieved in B -cell precursor (BCP) -ALL [121] . Furthermore, adaptation of the Euro -flow method across machines from different manufacturers make this a potentially useful technique in such a wide collaboration as the ATC [122] . The application of flow cytometric analysis to T -ALL is complicated by the more pronounced difficulty in discriminating aberrant f rom normal phenotypes in T -ALL. Therefore, 8 -colour flow cytometric panels developed by the NOPHO group will be used for T -ALL, but until adequate sensitivity is proven, flow cytometric analysis will not be used to determine eligibility for the IR-low group in T-ALL. 8.5.3.3 MRD for the Identific ation of the Highest Risk Group There is very little published data on the use of MRD at the highest levels. The recently published NOPHO ALL -2008 study, which used an MRD threshold of 5% prospectively and the retrospective analysis of UKALL2003 data being the main two ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 77 [14, 89] . Review of data within consortia members suggest t hat there is no clear evidence as to whether flow or molecular based methods provide better discrimination at the 5% level. Therefore, it was decided that patients would be stratified to the HR -group by MRD if either molecular or flow MRD was >5% at EOI. This protocol will represent an excellent opportunity to gather further data to enable an in depth comparison in the future. Analysis of the UKALL2003 cohort has clearly shown that MRD >5% represents the group with the highest risk of relapse [89]. Also the NOPHO 2008 study identified such patients as those with the very highest risk of relapse and this rendered them eligible for high intensity chemotherapy blocks followed by stem cell transplant [14]. Within this coh ort, genetics does add some prognostic significance [116] . The outcome of such patients, though worse than IR and SR patients on the NOPHO 2008 trial, was significantly better than that of equivalent patients on UKALL2003 treated largely with conventional chemotherapy. An individual patient data analysis from the CoALL , DCOG, NOPHO and UKALL groups identified 190 patients who had EOI MRD >5%. The overall survival of this group was 69%, the rate varying from 53% (UK) to 85% (NOPHO) (M. Heyman personal communication). Given these outcome data, the NOPHO therapeutic approach for these patients has been chosen. Genetic aberrations in the leukaemic clone as a basis for stratification 8.5.4.1 High-risk genetic lesions Numerous publications have identified five chromosomal abnormalities that have consistently been associated with a high risk of relapse and therefore poor overall . In order to determine the most appropriate allocation of patients with one of the se abnormalities within the MRD defined risk groups, data from previous trials conducted by consortia members: UKALL2003, DCOG10, NOPHO2008 and Co ALL97/03/09 were pooled. A total of 227 patients were available for retrospective analysis covering all five subgroup, we examined the outcome of patients overall and by MRD level using the thresholds used to define the MRD risk groups. Among 123 KMT2A -r cases, 25 ( 20%) had no informative MRD A total of 21/98 (17%) cases had undetectable MRD at EOI and no relapses so far. At the other end of the spectrum, >30% cases with MRD>5% relapsed compared with 16% cases with MRD >0% and <5%. Virtually all KMT2A -r cases had been treated as high risk. Despite some evidence of a better outcome for KMT2A -r patients with low EOI MRD, this was only achieved with intensive therapy. None of the near haploid or low hypodiploid patients treated on these historic trials had undetectable MRD at EOI and the 5 year EFS rates were 64% and 69% retrospectively; despite treatment on HR arms. Although the proportion of iAMP21 patients with undetectable MRD at EOI was similar to the overa ll percentage (i.e. 25%), the relapse rate was 25% which was the same as the relapse rate for all iAMP21 patients (23%). Based on these results, patients in ALLT ogether with KMT2A -r, NH, HoL or iAMP21 are not eligible for any treatment de -intensification (SR/IR-low arms) and should be stratified to IR -high or HR -therapy according to MRD (see below). The t(17;19) translocation is very rare (<0.1%) and only 4 patients were available for analysis (all from UKALL2003). All these patients relapsed and died with in 2 years of diagnosis which mirrors the dismal response reported in the literature from other protocols. [124, 125] Hence, all patients with t(17;19) should be allocated directly to the HR group. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 78 8.5.4.2 Copy -number alterations (CNAs) Genomic pr ofiling studies of paediatric ALL samples have revealed a plethora of non - random copy number alterations (CNA) which are mostly deletions and can range in size from single exons to large cytogenetically visible regions [126] . These CNA are secondary abnormali ties and the spectrum of CNA is strongly linked to the primary chromosomal abnormality [127] . The eight most eight CNA and indeed othe r CNA is a matter of considerable debate. The vast majority of studies have examined individual CNA and have rarely factored in the genetic background (i.e. primary chromosomal abnormality) or treatment response (i.e. MRD) both of which are important risk factors. Moreover, very few associations have been validated in independent cohorts. The exceptions are the UKALL -CNA and IKZF1plus profiles [1, 128, 129] .The UKALL - CNA profile defi nes three subgroups with distinct outcomes whereas the IKZF1plus profile defines a small subgroup of patients with a high risk of relapse. The IKZF1 plus profile was discovered and validated using the BFM -AEIOP ALL 2000 trial whereas UKALL -CNA profile was d efined using data from UKALL97/99 and has been validated on more than dozen trials including UKALL2003, DCOG -ALL10 and NOPHO -ALL2008. The risk stratification algorithm for this trial is based initially on MRD and patients with detectable MRD at the end of induction but <5% being allocated to the IR group . A significant proportion of these patients will have intermediate risk cytogenetics. While the IKZF1plus profile would probably have been able to define a small subset that could be allocated to the IR -high group it would not have been applicable to the vast majority of IR cases. However, the UKALL -CNA profile defines a good risk subgroup (see Table 8) which has been associated with an excellent prognosis even when observed in patients with intermediate ri sk cytogenetics (as known as B -other ALL) [1, 128, 129] . Therefore, when we pooled individua l patient data from UKA LL2003, DCOG10, NOPHO2008 and CoALL97/03/09 to examine the prognostic effect of genetics within the IR group to define IR -low and IR -high (see Figure 5, panel B) we included the UKALL -CNA good risk profile alongside ETV6 -RUNX1 and hi gh hyperdiploidy as genetic markers associated with a good outcome. 8.5.4.3 Patients with targetable gene fusions associated with BCR -ABL1 -like ALL Gene expression profiling (GEP) studies have identified a novel subgroup of ALL which had a GEP resembling that seen in BCR -ABL1 positive patients but occurring in patients lacking the fusion, sometimes referred to BCR -ABL1 -like or Philadelphia - like ALL an 10 -15% BCP -ALL [82, 83] . Further the majority of BCR -ABL1 -like patients harbour recurrent genetic lesions are now termed ABL -class because the resulting fusion has similar functional consequences to the canonical BCR -ABL1 fusion i.e. deregulation of tyrosine kinase activity. with ABL -class fusions have high levels of MRD post induction and a significantly higher relapse risk compared with other BCP -ALL patients [52, 84] . This association with poor outcome was mirrored in pooled from 31 patients harbouring ABL -class fusions and tre ated on historic UK, DCOG and Co ALL protocols. None of the patients had undetectable MRD at the end of induction and 74% had MRD>1%. The outcome of all these ABL -class fusion patients was poor with 11/23 (48%) patients with MRD>1% suffering induction failure or relapse and 3/8 (38%) of t he patients with MRD <1% relapsed. There is growing evidence that patients harbouring one of these ABL -class fusions are sensitive to tyrosine kinase ALLTogether Protocol Sep 2020 79 inhibitors e.g. Imatinib and dasatinib [85]. This evidence includes reports of patients with refractory disease at the end of induction achieving complete remission after treatment with a TKI [86, 87] . Several c linical study groups - e.g. COG [84, 88] have altered their frontline protocols to identify these patients rapidly and add a TKI to these children's therapy. In UKALL2011, patients with high MRD (>1%) at the end of induction are screened for ABL -class fusions and, if present, are treated with Imatinib in addition to standard chemotherapy [52, 89] . A large intergroup study of children with BCR -ABL1 + ALL showed that the addition of Imatinib to an intensive chemot herapy regimen improved disease free survival by ~20% compared with historical cohorts [90]. There is also some evidence that adding a TKI during induction is more beneficial than later on [91]. On the basis of this evidence, all patients in harbouring to the IR -high arm and to have their chemotherapy supplemented with Tyrosine - kinase inhibitor (TKI) Imatinib from day 15 (if <25 years) and from day 29 (if 25 years) . This allocation to IR -high is irrespective of their MRD at the end of induction even if it is >5%. ABL -class patients who do not respond to TKI (by MRD) by time point 2 will be allocated to the HR arm and subsequent allo -SCT.

In seeking to intensify therapy for those at highest risk of relapse, an unadjusted intermediate risk group containing 70% of patients was not an ideal candidate as it risked exposing the bulk of patients to intensification for the benefit of a small minority. It was therefore our aim to split this group further, identifying patients with a low risk of relapse as candidates for treatment de -intensification leaving the remaining patients with higher risk of relapse as stratified to the arm targeted for randomised treatment intensification. For these intermediate risk patients, MRD thresholds that determine a lower or higher risk of relapse are necessarily genotype s pecific [116] . This subgroup will comprise patients previously classified as both MRD negative and positive because it encompasses the traditional MRD of 0.01% (1x10-4) used 0.1% (1x10-3) used by NOPHO. The outcome heterogeneity that exists within this subgroup is self -evident given the prognostic impact of MRD reported by numerous clinical study groups. [12, 13, 25, 113] There is ample evidence in the literature to support the assertion that numerous risk factors will drive outcome within this subgroup, including the re are no studies directly focu sed on defining a group of patients with IR MRD at the end of induction who have an excellent outcome (i.e. relapse risk <5%, EFS>90%) and who may be suitable for treatment de -escalation. To define such a group, we pooled individual patient data from 3,284 patients who had been treated on UKA LL2003, DCOG10, NOPHO2008 and Co ALL97/03/09 trials and would be classified as MRD -IR (detectable at TP1 but <5%) (Figure 5). To minimise demographic, clinical and treatment heterogeneity within this pooled cohort, patients treated as Standard risk on Co ALL protocols and high risk on DCOG and NOPHO protocols were excluded because these treatment regimens were classified as sig nificantly different from the treatment regimens being considered for IR patients in ALLTogether. In addition, patients >25 years old, Down Syndrome and t(9;22)/ BCR -ABL1 patients w ere excluded. Our analysis focu sed on evaluating MRD, primary genetic altera tions and CNA as risk -factors. The primary outcome metric used was risk of relapse defined as the time from achieving a complete remission to the date of relapse at any site, censoring patients who died in CR1. The aim of the analysis was to identify a sub set of IR patients which had a good outcome (IR -low) which was defined as a risk of relapse at 5 years <5%, and EFS at 5 years of >91% and accounted for ~50% of the MRD IR -group. The remaining patients would be classified as IR -high. A large meta -analysi s of >13,000 patients demonstrated that MRD was associated with clinical outcome across therapies, times of assessment (post -induction and post - consolidation) and patient subgroups [92]. In addition, an in -depth analysis of the prognostic of MRD in UKALL2003 showed that the risk of relapse associated with a specific MRD level post -induction varied according to genetic subgroup [116] . Therefore, we sought to compare the effect of MRD post -induction and post - consolidation within our pooled IR cohort and to determine the most discriminatory MRD threshold. Cox regression analysis showed the MRD measured post -induction (TP1) was more powerful than when measured post -consolidation (TP2): post - induction hazard ratio = 1.22 (95% 1.16 -1.28), p<0.001 v 1.08 (1.1 -1.15), p=0.018. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 82 In addition, the C -index (which measures the concordance between the prediction and the actual outcome for the model [133] ) was greater for TP1 MRD: 66.1% revealed that for BCP -ALL MRD at TP1 was always more informative than TP2 MRD due to the fact that 70% cases h ad undetectable (i.e. 0%) MRD at TP2; hence any threshold examined was biased towards this large group. We were able to subdivide the cohort according to the presence of a number of different genetic subgroups. Utilising MRD threshold analysis we found tha t the most discriminatory MRD threshold varied by genetic subgroup (Figure 5, panel B) . This analys is revealed several subgroups defined by genetic alteration and MRD, which were associated with either a low or high risk of relapse. Therefore, we defined the IR-low as those patients who were in any of the four good risk subgroups defined by MRD and genet ics. All remaining IR cases were classified as IR -high. Table 10 shows the final definition of IR -low/high along with estimated size and outcomes ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 83 Figure 5: Threshold analysis was used to determine the most discriminatory MRD threshold. Panel A shows an e xample of the graph generated. Panel B details the different optimum MRD thresholds for the genetic subgroups. Panel A - An example of threshold analysis. The top graph shows the risk of relapse plotted against unique MRD thresholds. The blue/black circles show the risk of relapse for all patients with an MRD value more (blue)/less (black) than that specific MRD threshold. The greater the separation of the two lines the greater discriminatory potential of the threshold. The bottom graph shows the num ber of patients with MRD greater (blue)/less (black ) than the MRD threshold. The threshold when the two lines cross indicates the mid -point of the cohort (i.e. the threshold that splits the cohort 50:50). The optimum MRD threshold was determined by visuall y inspecting both plots to determine the threshold with the greatest discriminatory potential.

Applicability Each MRD -based stratification threshold has specific defined criteria (see ' Evaluation of BM MRD' ; section 6.3 .1) and protocol guideline s for MRD -analyses) and assays will be strictly assessed against these. One of the key aims of this study is to use an MRD based stratification for as many patients as possible. RQPCR currently has a clinical applicability in 92% of cases on UK protocols (J Han cock personal communication), and this may be improved further by the use of NGS based target identification . Despite relatively lower cell yields at end of induction [120] , at least 60% of patients had samples adequate for both RQPCR and >4 million cell count flow MRD in the study by Theunissen et al [121] . Sample handling algorithms will be put in place for patients where sample quantity restricts the MRD assays that can be ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 86 performed such that the most informative assays are prioritised for each patient. There will be some failures in t he genetic analyses, but we estimate that more than 97% of all patients will have a full genetic work -up. Overall, we estimate that the addition of 4 million cell flow cytometric MRD to molecular analysis should increase applicability to 94 -95% for the com bined genetic - and MRD -based analyses. Thus, the absolute majority of patients will be possible to stratify according to MRD. The small fraction of patients with inadequate genetic - or MRD -assays will by default be allocated to the IR -high risk arms of treatment. However, in the extremely rare event that neither MRD -analysis by PCR nor by FCM is discriminatory enough to call a level of less or more than 5% at the end of induction, patients may be up -graded to the HR -arm based on M3 status at the end of induction by cytomorphology only - if possi ble the morphology findings should be corroborated by directed genetic analyses such as FISH applied to the bone -marrow smears. Groups with special considerations 8.5.6.1 Older teenagers and young adults (TYAs) In 16 -24 year old patients treated on UKALL2003, the proportion of patients and EFS in these three groups were as follows; SR arm - 18.1% of the TYA group with a 5 year EFS of 95.5% IR-high arm - 69.2% of the TYA group with a 5 year EFS of 77.6% HR arm - 12.7% of the TYA group with a 5 year EFS of 23.3% For SR patients with an anticipated EFS of 95.5%, dose de -escalation of therapy appears to be justified. However, the SR arm is already substantially dose de - escalated compared to UKALL2003 regimen B and thus there is a need to demonstrate that this arm i s effective in this age group before a dose de -escalation randomisation could be considered. Thus, AYA patients fulfilling the SR arm criteria will be stratified to this arm, but will be exempt from de -escalating randomisation. The anticipated EFS for pat ients meeting the criteria for the IR group is less than 80%. It is therefore not reasonable to dose de -escalate therapy in these patients and more attractive to use innovative agents alongside conventional chemotherapy in this group. Thus AYA patients w ill not enter the IR -low arm and all will be stratified to the IR -high arm instead. The decision not allowing treatment according to the IR- low arm is taken after comparison of the UKALL2003 and NOPHO ALL 2008 protocols to the upcoming ALLTogether protocol , aiming not to achieve a de - escalation for the intermediate risk patients due to their inferior outcome with higher relapse rate in previous studies compared to the younger patients. AYA patients meeting the criteria for the HR arm expected to have an extremely poor outcome with an anticipated EFS of less than 25% on regimen C UKALL2003. This group will also have a very low salvage rate after relapse as they are having predominantly ea rly relapses. Furthermore, the UKALL 12 study [16] found a low overall survival especially in the cytogene tic high -risk group, supporting an intensive treatment for the high -risk patients. The NOPHO ALL 2008 protocol have showed similar results for the HR -chemotherapy and HR -HSCT group [14], but the high -risk group in the upcomi ng protocol is estimated to be smaller than in the NOPHO study, where some patients were allocated to HR therapy due to lack of response during induction, and the groups are thereby difficult to compare. For this cohort, all AYA are stratified to treatmen t with HR blocks followed by allogeneic HSCT if a suitable donor (sibling or unrelated) is identified. These patients may also be eligible for CAR - T cell therapy. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 87 Because of generally poor results for adult patients 25 years with KMT2A - rearrangements with conventional HR -therapy in NOPHO ALL -2008, KMT2A - rearrangement will be an optional HSCT -indication for this age -group. 8.5.6.2 Down Syndrome Patients Among children with ALL, 2 -3% have Down syndrome (DS). They are almost all exclusively precursor B -ALL immunoph enotype (DS -ALL). DS favourable cytogenetics -RUNX1, AF4-MLL) but aberrant expression CRLF2 is found in 60 % of DS -ALL. DS -ALL is characterised by a high risk of relapse and a high infection related mortality. [134] Historic Outcomes A PdL study of 653 DS -ALL cases between 1995 -2005 showed that the 10 year overall survival was 70 % compared to 88 % in the non -DS population. This poor outcome was due to a combination of increased relapse risk and higher treatment related mortality (TRM). DS -ALL patients had a higher 8 -year cumulative of relapse (26% \u00b1 2% vs 15% \u00b1 1%, -DS patients, lower 8-year on UKALL 2003 compared with non -DS ALL, patients with DS -ALL had an inferior event free survival (65. 6% vs. 87.7% at 5 years; P < 0.00005) and overall survival (70.0% vs. 92.2%; P < 0_00005). Excess TRM was primarily responsible for the worse outcomes for DS - ALL (21.6% at 5 years, vs. 3.3%, P < 0.00005). [36, 136] Measurable residual disease (MRD) risk status was highly discriminant for relapse in DS patients with 0/28 relapses in the MRD low risk group. In part, poor outcomes may also reflect dose reduction/modification due to concerns over infection risk. In support of this, a recent DCFI study highlighted that s imilar outcomes to non -DS children could be achieved when reductions in drug dosage or modifications were not made. [137] Thus children with DS -ALL who have detectable MRD at end of induction (EOI) are a high risk group. Risk Stratification The P dL analysis highlighted that Independent favorable prognostic factors include age <6 years (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58, P = .002), white blood cell (WBC) count <10 \u00d7 109/L (HR = 0.60, P = .005), and ETV6 -RUNX1 (HR = 0.14, P = .006) for EFS. Age (HR = 0.48, P < .001), ETV6 -RUNX1 (HR = 0.1, P = .016) and high hyperdiploidy (HeH) (HR = 0.29, P = .04) were prognostic for relapse -free survival. [135] A DCOG and UKALL analysis also determined that deletion in IKZF1 were also associated with a poor prognosis with EFS of only 32 %. [138] An A pooled analysis of 196 DS - ALL patients (fro m UKALL 2003, DCOG, NOPHO and Co ALL) confirmed that EOI MRD and IKZF1 deletions are the strongest prognostic factors (see Table 11 and 12). As can be seen below, children with DS -ALL who have an undetectable end of induction MRD have an excellent prognosis. Conversely the presence of detectable MRD at EOI is associated with high risk disease. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 88 Table 11. Outcomes of 88 DS children from the ALL together consortium (UKALL 2003 and DCOG) with or without IKZF1 deletion .

EOI (day 29) MRD will be used as per the ALL together risk stratification HR-genetics/CNS -status will be used as per the ALL together risk stratification IKZF1 deletion will stratify to IR CRLF2 aberrations are not risk stratifying Standard Risk arm This will include DS -ALL children who have an EOI MRD undetectable and are IKZF1 wild type. Intermediate Risk DS-ALL who are EOI MRD detectable (< 5 %) and/or who are IKZF1 deleted. High Risk DS-ALL who are EOI MRD detectable ( 5 %) will be allocated t o the high risk arm. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 89 Risk-Group Stratification Sequence Clinical -, laboratory -, genetic - and response -criteria will influence the risk -group stratification, which will be performed in a stepwise process starting with the choice of induction therapy. This process is slightly different for BCP - and T -cell patients and is therefore described separately. It is also summarised in Figure 7. 8.5.7.1 Risk group stratification sequence for BCP-patients Stratification 1 based on clinical factors determines the choic e of induction therapy o Induction A - (3-drug induction with Dex+VCR+PEG -Asp) + it therapy will be administered to patients fulfilling both criteria: - Age <10 years at diagnosis - WBC <50 B - (4-drug induction with Dex+VCR+PEG -Asp+DNR) + it therapy will be administered to patients fulfilling any of the criteria: - Age 10 years at diagnosis - WBC 50 x 109/L o Patients who are found to carry high -risk genetic alterations in the leukaemic clone will start induction A or B depending on age and WBC. Patients who started on Induction B will continue on B. Patients who started on Induction A will shift to Induction C (with addition of a higher dose Daunorubicin at day 16 and 23). o Down patients (almost invariably BCP) will start Induction D (a 3 -drug induction) regardless of age and WBC. Down patients with very poor response to initial induction therapy: MRD day 15 25%, will receive one dose of Daunorubicin day 16. o Patients who ar e <25 years old and are found to carry ABL -class fusions in the leukaemic clone will start induction A or B according to age and WBC, but will shift to: - Induction E (adding Imatinib from day 15) if they started Induction A or - Induction F (addition Imatinib from day 15) if they started Induction B Patients who are 25 years old and carry ABL -class fusions continue induction B. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 90 Figure 7. Algorithm for choice of Induction therapy Stratification 2 at TP1 (day 29) based on clinical, genetic and response factors (MRD at TP1) determines the choice of Consolidation 1 therapy for BCP-patients o The Standard Risk version of Consolidation 1 will be administered to patients fulfilling all criteria below: - no CNS3/TLP+ at diagnosis (CNS1 or CNS2 -patients who cleared CSF by day 15 are eligible) - no high -risk genetic aberrations in the leukaemic clone: Low hypodiploidy (31 -40 chromosomes) amplification of chromosome time -point 1 (TP1) by either PCR or FCM - no remaining testicular leukaemia (by bilateral ultrasound) NB 1! for these patients, no additional MRD -testing and stratification will apply and thus, these patients will be stratified to the SR -arm at TP1. o Patients with ABL -class fusions, will receive Consolidation 1 for IR/HR - patients with the addition of Imatinib (continuous from induction for patients <25 years and starting day 30 for patients 25 years). o Down patients, will receive: - the SR -version of Consolidation 1 if they fulfill all criteria listed above and in addition do not have a deletion of the IKZF1 -gene in the leukaemic clone. These patients are finally stratified to the Down -SR group. - the Dow n IR-version of Consolidation 1 if - MRD is detectable but <5% at day 29 or - the IKZF1 -gene is deleted in the leukaemic clone or - a high -risk genetic aberration is detected in the ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 91 leukaemic clone - the Down HR -version of Consolidation 1 if - MRD is 5% at day 29 o Patients who do not qualify for SR -stratification and who do not have ABL-class fusions or Down syndrome will all receive Consolidation 1 therapy for IR/HR -patients and will be stratified after TP1 as follows: - High-risk if - t(17;19)(q23;p13)/ TCF3 -HLF positive patients - MRD 5% at day 29 - Tentative IR -low if - age <16 years and - no HR -genetics and - no CNS3/TLP+ with 5 cells/microL CSF at diagnosis or CNS -contamination of CSF not cleared by day 15 and - MRD <0.1% at TP1 if high (51 -65/67 chromosomes - HeH) or - MRD <0.05% at TP1 if no ETV6/RUNX1 or a Good Risk CNA -profile (CNA Table 9 and Figure 6) NB!

This only applies if the patient does not have access to a CAR -T study o Patients, w ho for some reason (age -limitations or lack of an open trial) do not have access to a CAR -T trial, will be finally stratified to the HR -arm if they have MRD 5% at TP1 and will in addition have an indication for HSCT if the MRD at TP1.5 is 0.5%. The therapy will be switched to HR - blocks from that time -point and an assessment of MRD at TP2 will not be obtained. o Down -patients with MRD 5% at day 29 will be stratified to the Down HR - arm and will have MRD -evaluation at day 57. If there is no response at this time -point, the patient is labelled protocol therapy failure and taken off protocol.

ABL-class fusions = Fusion disease ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 95 8.5.7.4 Risk group stratification sequence for T-cell patients Stratification 1 based on clinical factors determines the choice of induction therapy : o All T-cell patients will receive Induction B (4 -drug induction with Dex+VCR+PEG -Asp+DNR) except - Down -patients (very rare in T -cell ALL) who will start with Induction D (3 -drug induction with addition of Daunorubicin day 16 if poor response) - Patients <25 years old with ABL -class fusions, who will shift to Induction F (addition of Imatinib) from day 15. Stratification 2 at TP1 (day 29) based on clinical, genetic and response factors (MRD at TP1) determines the choice of consolidation 1 therapy for T - cell patients : o Patients with ABL-class fusions, will receive Consolidation 1 for IR/HR -patients with the addition of Imatinib (continuous from induction for patients <25 years and starting day 30 for patients 25 years). o Down patients (very rare in T -cell disease), will receive: - the Down IR -version of Consolidation 1 if - MRD is detectable but <5% at day 29 or - the Down HR -version of Consolidation 1 if - MRD is 5% at day 29 o Patients who do not have ABL -class fusions or Down syndrome (most patients) will receive Consoli dation 1 therapy for IR/HR -patients and will be stratified after TP1 as follows: - Tentative High -risk if - MRD 5% at day 29 - Tentative IR -risk if - MRD is <5% at day 29 Stratification 3 based on MRD -information at TP1.5 (day 50) for T -cell patients o Patients with MRD 5% at day 29 will be evaluated for MRD by FCM day 50 and will be finally stratified to the HR -arm if the MRD at TP1.5 is 0.5%. The therapy will be switched to Nelarabine -containing regimens and for these patients the goal is HSC T in first CR as soon as the MRD and general condition allows. MRD will be used to select further therapy for these patients, but none of these analyses will be stratifying. o Patients with MRD 5% at day 29, who have MRD day 50 <0.5% will continue on Consolidation 1 therapy without Nelarabine and will be stratified at TP2 (day 71). Stratification 4 based on clinical, genetic and MRD -information at TP1 and TP2 (day 71) o Patients will be finally stratified to the HR -arm and will in addition have an indication for HSCT in CR1 if the MRD at TP2 is 0.0 5%. - This is also true for patients stratified as tentative IR at TP1, who will be re -stratified to the HR -group (HSCT) at ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 96 this point. - This is also true for patients with ABL -class fusions, who have received Imatinib from day 15 (<25 years) or day 30 (25 years). They will stop their Imatinib at this time - point. o Patients with MRD at TP1 5%, who had MRD at TP1.5 day 50 <0.5% and continued on Consolidation 1 are finally stratified to the HR -arm and will in addition have an indic ation for HSCT in CR1 if they have detectable MRD at TP2. o Patients will be finally stratified to the HR-arm and will have an indication for HSCT in CR1 if they have a mediastinal mass, which has not been reduced to <1/3 of the initial volume at TP2. o Patients will be finally stratified to the HR-arm and will have an indication for HSCT in CR1 if they have testicular disease that has not resolved (by bilateral ultrasound) at TP2 . o Patients stratified as tentative HR at TP1, who had MRD <0.5% at day 50, will be finally re-stratified to the IR -high group if they received Consolidation 1 without Nelarabine and MRD at TP2 is undetectable. NB! To call T -cell ALL not detectable, the MRD -analysis has to be PCR -based - (FCM is not enough). o Patients will be finally stratified to the IR-low arm if they fulfil all the following criteria: - age less than 16 years at diagnosis - no CNS3/TLP+ with 5 cells/microL CSF at diagnosis - no hig h-risk genetic lesions (listed above) - no ABL -class gene fusions (listed above) and - MRD undetectable at TP2 if T -cell ALL. NB! To call T -cell ALL not detectable, the MRD - analysis has to be PCR-based - (not detectable by FCM is not enough). o Patients with ABL-class fusions and MRD <0.01% at TP2 will be finally stratified to the IR-high arm with the addition of Imatinib o All other patients will be finally stratified to the IR-high arm including: - patients with failed mandatory genetic work -up 8.5.7.5 Indications for allogeneic stem -cell transplantation (allo -HSCT) for T -cell patients All patients will qualify for allo -HSCT in first complete remission if MRD at TP1 is 5% and MRD at day 50 is 0.5%.

STUDY ASSESSMENTS A ND SAMPLE COLLECTION S The mandatory sample collections/ procedures over the course of the protocol are presented in ALLTogether1 - Interventions/ Sample collections . It is important to collect Informed Consent/s before any study related sample collections or investigations. In addition to the sample collection schedule, a table of all assessments is presented in ALLTogether1 Assessment schedule and ALLTogether1 Extra AESIs Assessments schedule . Medical History at diagnosis includes full medical history including family history with regard to predisposition syndromes, symp toms leading up to diagnosis of leukaemia , current medications and any current medical conditions or abnormalities. Full physical examination at diagnosis performed should at a minimum include: assessment of extent of extramedullary involvement - size of liver and spleen in cm below the costal margin - lymph -node involvement ( 3cm) - testicular involvement and testicular volume for males - other involved sites (skin, eyes) neurological examination to detect signs indicating clinical CNS - involvement. Vital signs include pulse, respirations, blood pressure and temperature Height/Weight and Body Surface Area Body surface area should be calculated using Mosteller BSA Formula [139] or according to national guidelines . Cardiac Assessment at diagnosis and follow -up The assessment performed at diagnosis include ECG and Echocardiography but may be limited to only Echocardiography according to ALLTogether1 - Interventions/Sample collections at other timepoints. The assessment can be postponed to before Delayed Intensification for NCI standard risk patients not receiving Daunorubicin in induction. However, it is mandatory for patients with ABL - class fusions, who are shifted to induction including Imatinib at day 15. Performance status Assessment of Lansky or Karnofsky performance status should be performed at diagnosis and at the start of the randomised phases. . Chest X-ray/CT/MRI of the thorax at diagnosis is performed to rule out/confirm mediastinal mass. Bone -marrow at diagnosis and follow -up for MRD -assessment In exceptional cases, when a bone -marrow diagnosis cannot be obtained because of poor clinical condition and the peripheral blood is leukaemic , diagnostic procedures may be performed on peripheral blood (see section 6.1) Aspirate for preparation of smears for cytomorphology and FISH -analyses. Cytomorphological assessment of response (M1 -M3). Aspirate for flow -cytometric assessment (diagnostic and baseline for MRD - analysis by FCM). At day 15 this assessment is not stratifying but is considered mandatory to assess changed expression -pattern to inform the FCM -MRD assessment at day 29 and day 71. In addition, the day 15 response will be explored as a future potential prognostic marker, since it has been used to stratify patients by several study - ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 103 groups in the past and could also be of clinical importance should infectious complications occur durin g the latter part of the induction therapy. Aspirate for DNA -isolation and identification of targets for PCR -based MRD - analysis ( at diagnosis, day 29 , day 71 , before HR -blocks and as needed ). Aspirate for DNA -isolation and genetic work -up at diagnosis (id entification of leukaemia -specific stratifying genetic changes) In addition, standard G -band karyotyping of leukemic cells. CD22 expression on the leukemic cells measured by flowcytometry at diagnos is can be used to determine CD22 positivity. If not available bone marrow at TP1 and/or TP2 can be used to determine CD22 expression. CD22 expression level can only be measured at diagnosis. Both can be measured in a standard laboratory used within the ALL Together consortium. The flow results will be centrally reviewed. CD22 -expression should be repeated in case of loss of response/progression to study clonal evolution. Biobanking. Trephine needle bone -marrow biopsy in case aspiration -material proves insufficient. It is recommended that the biopsy is transported in non - denaturing conditions (saline -drenched gauze or culture medium), so that fresh leukemic cells may be obtained for back -up diagnostic work -up if aspiration yields insufficient material. Please, refer to protocol guidelines for BM -puncture for technique and sequence in BM-sampling. Lumbar puncture at diagnosis and follow -up cell-count (white and red cells/microliter) cytospin -preparation for assessment of cytomorphology and immune -cytology if indicated to distinguish leukemic cells from normal lymphoid cells. additional chemistry and microbiology as clinically indicated. collection in tube containing Transfix -solution to make it possible to assess morphological findings by FCM. Biobanking It is recommended that the lumbar puncture (at least for children) is performed in deep sedation/general anaesthesia ( not utili sing gas -mixes containing nitrous oxide ), using a pencil -point needle, by an experienced practitioner and after considered correction of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy t o minimise the risk of traumatic lumbar puncture. If these preconditions cannot be fulfilled, the diagnostic LP may be postponed, but should be performed as soon as it is assessed as clinically safe to do so. Furthermore, the diagnostic lumbar puncture sh ould be accompanied by the first dose of intrathecal medication to counteract any inadvertent contamination of the CSF from the blood. The CSF collected should immediately after the tap be diluted in a known volume of culture medium (alternatively, the CS F may be collected in pre -filled tubes with medium) and transported to the laboratory within an hour to minimise the ex -vivo decay of leukemic cells. The laboratory should be instructed to measure the volume of the sample upon arrival to make necessary dil ution -corrections possible. Please, refer to protocol guidelines for LP for technique and sequence of sampling.

TREATMENT OVERVIEW 10.1 Treatment General Aspects The therapy in the ALLTogether protocol consists of an amalgamation of well -known therapy -elements from the legacy protocols of the participating groups put together in a well known general sequence: - Induction - same label in ALLTogether - Induction consolidation - in ALLTogether labelled \" Consolidation - CNS -consolidation - in \" 3\" - \"Delayed intensification\" - same label in ALLTogether - \"Maintenance\" - same label in ALLTogether In addition, high -risk patients are treated with high -risk blocks as an added element and for Down patients an Interim Maintenance phase or a Capizzi -element is inserted replacing the standard CNS -consolidation. A relatively small selection of patients, estimated to be in the order of 2% of children <16 and 10% of older teenagers and young adults will have allogeneic stem -cell transplant (allo-SCT) as proposed standard of care and some of those patients may also qualify for experimental CAR -T therapy (conducted in separate studies). A therapy overview as well as graphic depictions of the therapy -elements per risk - group are provided in the Figures below . 10.2 Therapy Elements Induction (first phase) The induction therapy is a modified version of the UKALL 2003 protocol induction using a moderate dose of Dexamethasone as steroid and Anthracycline only for NCI HR- and T -cell patients. The choice of steroid during induction has been extensively studied and remains controversial [140, 141] . Comparisons have part ly been hampered by questions of dose -ratios and equipotency as well as differences in combination with Anthracycline or not in different studies. For overall comparisons of results also stratification -effects, mixed effects of Prednisolone and Dexamethaso ne in protocols using a prephase and additional issues regarding backbone chemotherapy context come into play. The extensive experience gained from UKALL -, COG and FRALLE -protocols, with high efficacy and acceptable treatment - related mortality during induc tion speaks in favour of this choice. Furthermore, this induction -therapy is the basis of MRD -based stratification in the largest study - population of a study -group preceding the formation of the consortium [12, 16, 25] . The lower dose of 6mg/m2/day instead of 10mg/m2/day has been associated with lower rate of treatment -related deaths in contemporary protocols [12, 22, 115] . The stratified use of Daunorubicin also makes a randomised reduction in ther apy for LR - patients completely removing Anthracycline from the therapy possible. NCI-LR patients, will receive a 3 -drug induction consisting of Dexamethasone (Dex a) 6mg/m2/day on days 1 -28 with tapering, four doses of Vincristine (VCR) and two doses of Pegylated Asparaginase ( PEG -Asp). NCI -HR patients will in addition receive four doses of Daunorubicin (Dauno) on the same days as VCR. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 118 Compared with UKALL -2003 the following changes will be made: Intrathecal therapy will be single Methotrexate for most patients and triple (Methotrexate , Cytarabin e and Prednisolone) for patients with CNS3, TLP+ with 5 cells/microL CSF at diagnosis and patients who do not clear CNS2/TLP+ contamination by day 15. T wo doses will be administered to pati ents with CNS1 and a minimum of one additional dose (CNS2) or two doses will be given to patients with CNS3 or TLP+ at diagnosis. The dose of Pegylated Asparaginase ( PEG -Asp) is 1500IU/m2 for patients <16 years and 1000IU/m2 for patients 16. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) will be used to detect inactivation and make it possible to switch to effective alternative therapy (see switching -guidelines under point 10.3.1) [142] . Patients with ABL -class genetic lesions) will receive the TKI Imatinib from day 15 of the induction therapy if they are <25 years and from day 30 for patients 25 . Consolidation 1 (induction consolidation) therapy The Consolidation 1 phase is based on the Induction 1B -phase developed by the BFM -group extensively used by ALL study -groups worldwide [56]. The version used in ALLTogether is a slightly modified from UKALL: Vincristine , intrathecal therapy and PEG -Asp timed to be continuous with the last dose given in induction is administered awaiting the MRD -result from the day 29 bone -marrow. When the MRD -results are known, the rest of the phase is administered according to the MRD -result. Patients with undetectable MRD stratified to the SR-group receive the rest of the block without the addition of Cyclophosphamide to avoid the genotoxic effect on normal cells and with only two intrathecal dose s. All other patients receive the full block with two doses of Cyclophosphamide and three intrathecal dose s. The second Cyclophosphamide -dose is brought forward to before the start of the third set of Cytarabine -doses (protocol day 50) in order to cause less myelosuppression at the beginning of the subsequent phase . Patients in complete remission after induction receive the rest of the block upon peripheral count recovery, whereas patients with high leukaemic cell burden (5%) after induction proceed with the therapy regardless of counts. CNS -Consolidation (Consolidation 2 and Consolidation 3) All patients except the SR-group (and a few high -risk patients with very poor response day 29 and day 50) undergo bone -marrow examination for assessment of MRD at day 71. Patients who achieved remission after induction (including SR- patients) continue with standard CNS -consolidation and for these patients , this protocol day is defined by recovery of peripheral counts and the start of the therapy phase. The therapy is combined low -dose 6 -Mercaptopurine (6MP) and two doses HDMTX ) together with triple intrathecal therapy for each phase of CNS -consolidation, shown in many trials to be an effective systemic as well as CNS -directed therapy [104, 143] . The traditional BFM -based protocol M is divided into two for patients receiving both Consolidation 2 and Consolidation 3 to decrease the risk of folic acid \"pre-rescue\" before the latter HDMTX -doses [144] . Delayed Intensification Since Delayed intensification (DI) was introduced by the BFM -group in the 1970s [56], it has been shown to improve outcome for both higher - and lower risk patients [57, 58] and is now included in most contemporary protocols [26, 59] . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 119 The SR and IR -Low risk groups use the UKALL standard DI [12] (supplemental) with the modification that the Cyclophosphamide at the beginning of the second phase of the DI is omitted for the SR-group and only two doses of intrathecal triple therapy are administered. IR-High patients receive an extended DI used in the Dana Farber Cancer Institute protocols adopted by DCOG in the protocols DCOG10 [13] and DCOG11, consisting of Vincristine , Doxorubicin, 6MP and intrathecal therapy. Maintenance Therapy Standard maintenance therapy is administered until 2 years after achieved complete remission - for most patients this will amount to 106 weeks of therapy in total , but is extended by 6 weeks for patients in the experimental Inotuzumab -arm of R3 - InO. Nelarabine for high -risk T -cell patients Poorly responding T -cell patients will under certain circumstances be defined as refractory to standard therapy and will receive Nelarabine - either as a single agent block (650 mg/m2/day x 5 days pat ients <21 years, 1500mg/m2/day every other day 3 doses - patients 21 -45 years ) or in combination with continu ed Consolidation 1 chemotherapy. High-Risk Blocks After Consolidation 1, patients with high leukaemic burden day 29 (5%) and patients with high MRD at TP2, day 71, (0.05%) , or for T -cell patie nts patients who do not respond to Nelarabine -containing therapy, continue with high -risk block therapy. The high -risk blocks selected for the high -risk arm to intensify therapy were chosen after the treatment -results from the DCOG, UKALL, Co ALL and NOPHO legacy cohorts were compared fo r patients with very high MRD -values ( 5%) or M3 morphology status at the end of first induction. The therapy approaches were different, with high -risk blocks used by DCOG [13] and NOPHO [14] and mo re continuous therapy used by Co ALL and UKALL [25]. The results should be interpreted with caution , since the groups were not entirely comparable, but the block -approach to these extreme high -risk patients seemed more effective : The likelihood of 5 -year Overall Survival was 0.87 and 0.77 for NOPH O and DCOG and 0.65 and 0.53 for Co ALL and UKALL respectively (not shown) . The NOPHO -blocks were chosen instead of the DCOG counterparts, since the leukaemia -specific survival was similar, but the data indicated that they were slightly less toxic when also delays between blocks and other side -effects were evaluated. Allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transp lant (allo - HSCT) in ALLTogether High risk patients will be stratified to treatment with 6 high -risk blocks and continued conventional chemotherapy (BCP -patie nts) or 1 -3 high -risk blocks followed by allogeneic HSCT (BCP - and T -cell patients). For CD19 -positive BCP -patients, CAR - T treatment is an option for some of these patients if a relevant CAR -T study is available in the study group, see section o n CAR -T. If the patient does not enter a ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 120 CAR -T study, the patient should proceed to allogeneic HSCT if one of the following indications for HSCT is fulfilled: 1) MRD at TP1 5% (only for 2) at 0.05% (all 3) MRD 0.5% day 50 71 (T -cell patient with MRD TP1 5%) 4) Patients 25 years old with KMT2A -rearrangements (optional indication) 5) Patients with increasing MRD following CAR -T treatment (defined in the CAR - T studies) Patients who are referred to HSCT will withdraw from ALLTogether1 -therapy when they start their conditioning protocol, but will remain in the ALLTogether1 trial for evaluation of primary and secondary end -points. There will be no randomisations within the HSCT group. The very large HSCT cohort may instead be subject for prospective studies of immune reconstitution, alloreactivity and toxicity. In order to achieve a common platform for such studies the following transplant modalities will be recommended: Transplant procedure Timing : Optimal timing of HSCT will provide that donor search is initiated immediately at time of HSCT indication followed in most cases by 1-3 high -risk blocks and ideally an MRD of at least <0.1%. Time from end of Consolidation 1 (TP2) to Day 0 should ideally be less than 100 days. In case of MRD > 0.1% before planned HSCT, bridging therapy is optional but must be documented in the ALLTogether study database. Donor, graft and conditioning regimen: Most centers within ALLTogether are included in the FORUM trial and follow this protocol until the end of recruitment, which is aimed at 2021. Following the results of the latest interim analysis in December 2018, patients older than 4 years are transplanted according to the standard reg imen consisting of TBI 12 Gy and VP16. Chemoconditioning including either BuFluThio or TreoFluThio is standard for patie nts < 4 years or in case of TBI non -eligibility. Centers that do not actively participate in the FORUM trial are encouraged to use the standard arm of FORUM (TBI/VP16). It is recommended to apply the donor and graft selection published by Peters et al (JCO 2015) [145] . Some local adaptations to donor hierarchy are allowed, according to local experience and preference, eg for cord blood or haplo -identical transplants. They should be described in a protocol and shared in the group. Donor hierarchy: Matched Sibling Donor (MSD)>Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD) >Haploidentical Donor Graft hierarchy: Bone -Marrow (BM), Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) and Cord Blood (CB) are all allowed. HLA-match: 9 -10/10 BM and PBSC; 5 -6/6 in CB with sufficient cell dose. CB: Minimal required match and stem cell dose according to local protocols. Recommended cell dose: 6/6, 5/6 donor CMV positive recipient should be avoided if possible Conditioning:TBI 12 Gy in 6 fractions (for adults 4 fractions is acceptable) + VP16 60 mg/kg (max 1800 mg/m2) or if chemotherapy based and FORUM center: Bu/Flu/TT or Treo/Flu/TT: Fludarabin 30 mg/m2 daily from to -3 (4 doses), Thiotepa 5 mg/kg x2 day -2 and either Pk adjust ed iv Busulfan (AUC90) from day -7 to -3 (4 doses) or Treosulfan 14 g/m2 day -6 to -3 (3 doses). If not FORUM center chemoconditioning according to local standards ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 121 should be applied Serotherapy according to either the FORUM protocol or local standards. Pk measurements are encouraged. GVHD -prophylaxis: Calcineurin inhibitor according to local standard. Should be kept at low serum levels (corresponding to CyA 100 -140) and tapered from day 60 in case of MSD and at latest from day 100 in case of MUD. 3 doses of MTX 10 mg/m2 is recommended in cas e of PBSC (any donor) and MUD . MTX is optional for BM grafts in MSD. Follow up post HSCT: Prospective registration of chimerism, immune reconstitution and MRD along with basic toxicity parameters will be defined at fix ed time point in the follow up period of at least two years. 10.3 Special Aspects and Special Groups Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of Asp araginase - activity Asparaginase is a foreign protein that can cause hypersensitivity reactions varying from mild allergies to anaphylactic shock. The formation of anti -drug antibodies may also accelerate clearance and neutrali se asparaginase without developing clinical symptoms of an allergy. This phenomenon, called 'silent inactivation', also results in reduced aspa raginase levels and decreased treatment intensity. [142, 146, 147] In both conditions the asparaginase activity levels will be non -therapeutic or zero, therefore continuing the same preparation is useless and preparations need to be switched or stopped. Of note, activity levels can be zero even with mild (CTCAE grade 1) all ergies. [142] However, some patients have an 'allergic -like reaction', a clinical allergy but without neutrali sation of asparaginase activity. These patients might continue with the same preparation when they maintain adequate asparaginas e activity levels and when subsequent administrations are clinically possible. Distinction between hypersensitivity and allergic -like reactions is critical but may be difficult. Interpreting an asparaginase activity level after a truncated infusion is comp licated, but may be useful to know. [148, 149] Risk factors for hypersensitivity reactions Clinical studies that report clinical allergy percentages are difficult to compare because of differences in preparations, dosing schedules, route of administration (intravenous versus intramuscular), and treatment phases. Hypersensitivity rates vary widely ranging from only a few percent in induction up to 75% in intensification when native E -coli is used in induction and intensification. [150, 151] The current protocols using PEG -asparaginase report a lower hypersensitivity rate. Silent inactivation has been reported in 4 -10% of the patients. [142, 150, 152] The incidence of allergic -like reactions is unknown. Pegylated asparaginase is less immunogenic than unpegylated asparaginase because the allergenic groups or so -called epi topes are masked by coupling polyethylene glycol (PEG), reducing the allergic potential of the drug. [153] Besides differences in immunogenicity between preparations, dosing schedule and treatment phase are important determinants of differences in frequency of allergic side effects. Several studies show that the probability for hypersensitivit y reactions increases along with the number of doses within one treatment cycle and with renewed administration following an extended asparaginase free interval. Hypersensitivity reactions to asparaginase make it impossible to continue that specific prepar ation, ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 122 but asparaginase therapy can be continued after switching preparations. [142, 147, 154] Cross -reactivity between antibodies against E -coli and PEG -asparaginase, but not Erwinia asparaginase has been found [151, 155] . Clinical hypersensitivity occurs almost exclusively more frequently in intensification phase when asparaginase is administered after a period in which it has not been given for weeks or months. There are several putative explanations for the rarity of allergic reactions during induction; there might be a delay in an effec tive immune response due to the time taken for complement activation and the subsequent production of antibodies, the intensive corticosteroids treatment in induction might mask symptoms associated with allergy [156] and the frequency of dosing during induction may have a desensitizing effect. An increase in anti -E-coli asparaginase antibodies has been reported in the period in which no asparaginase was given between induction and intensification. Between the first and second PEG - asparaginase dose in intensification antibodies increased significantly in patients with a clinical allergy on the second dose of PEG -asparaginase. [142] Therefore, a continuous dosing schedule of asparaginase might reduce the number of hypersensitivity reactions. In the ALLTogether protocol intravenous administration of PEG -Asparaginase and Erwinia -Asparaginase is standard, but intramuscular administration is also allowed. The aim of TDM is to optimise asparaginase treatment by: - Detection of silent inactivation - Distinguishing allergic -like reactions from real allergic reactions. - Creating the possibility to study the association between activity level and leukaemia -specific and toxicity outcomes. Patients with silent inactivation or clinical allergy to aspara ginase together with inactivating antibodies will be switched to Erwinia Chrysantemii -derived asparaginase (Erwinase). This may prevent serious allergic reactions and will prevent patients from getting ineffective medication. Patients with allergic -like re actions but without inactivation may, at least in some cases, to continue with the same preparation after adequate pre -medication. For details of timing of measurements and actions depending on the results, see procedure s/assessments overview or guidelines on TDM of Asp -activity and protocol guidelines for switching of preparations. Switching guidelines [149] 1. Allergy all grades and inac tivation: a. Switch PEG -asp to Erwinia asp (20000 U/m2 every other day ). If the patient also develops an allergy with inactivation to Erwinia asp, no alternative asparaginase preparation is available and asp treatment needs to be truncated. b. Do not use steroids or antihistamines to administer next doses, because it will not reverse the inactivation. c. When no asp activity level is available see 3b. If clinically impossible to re - expose than preparation should be switched or stopped. 2. Silent inact ivation: a. Switch PEG -asp to Erwinia asp (20000 U/m2 every other day) b. If the patient also develops an allergy to or SI of Erwinia asp, no alternative asparaginase preparation is available and asp treatment needs to be truncated. 3. Allergic -like reac tion: a. When the trough asp activity level taken before this dose is adequate you can re -expose carefully to the same preparation (if clinically possible). In these cases premedication with hydrocortisone and antihistamines is allowed as well as decreasi ng the infusion rate. b. When no trough level is available, check the asp activity level after the dose taking into account how much of the dose is administered, in case of detectable ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 123 asparaginase activity you can re -expose carefully to the same preparat ion (if clinically possible). Guidelines for asparaginase activity level measurement: - after PEGasp - immediately (within one hour = toplevel) - after the truncated dose - within a few days or 1 week. Timing of asp activity level also depend on how much of the dose is given! In case of Erwinia asp take a toplevel and a level after 24 -48hrs. If only a few milliliters are infused a post -dose activity level might not be informative and asparaginase preparation should be switched or stopped. CNS -directe d therapy In the era of risk -adapted ALL treatment protocols, CNS status may not anymore contribute to overall survival, but it still influences the risk of CNS -related relapses [106] . Even though the majority of CNS -relapses of ALL are rescuable, the prognosis for early CNS relapse remains challenging the ALLTogether consortium 58081 treatment guidelin es and OG11 but not in UKALL 2011 or Co ALL09 protocols. In a univariate analysis of combined data from the ATG consortium (UK, DCOG, NOPHO, Co ALL, EORTC) we observed that overall relapse rate (20.5 vs. 10%, p<0.001, unpublished) and isolated CNS relapse rate (7.6 vs 1.6%, p <0.001, unpublished data) was higher in patients with CNS leukemia at diagnosis as compared to those without. With this data, given that all the groups had included extra intrathecal therapy to patients with CNS leukemia, CNS leukemia will remain as a stratifying risk factor by excluding these patients from the SR and the IR -Low groups in the ATG protocol. The role of CNS2 status as a risk factor for relapse is unclear. In some reports, CNS2 status has been associated with an increased relapse rate [111] . On the other hand, it has also been suggested that additional intrathecals given to CNS2 patients may contribute to an increase in life -threatening or fatal infections in induction (unpublished data). So far, all the ATG groups contri buting data (DCOG, UK, NOPHO, Co ALL, EORTC) have given two extra doses of intrathecal medication in induction to patients with CNS2 status at diagnosis. In a univ ariate analysis of data from the ATC, we observed that CNS2 status was not a risk factor for overall relapse rate as compared to the CNS1 status (11.0 vs 10.0%, p=0.201, unpublished), although there was a trend towards an increased isolated CNS relapse rat e among the CNS2 patients (2.3 vs 1.6%, p=0.088, NS). Furthermore, in the pooled ATC data, extra intrathecals to the CNS2 patients do not seem to increase the toxicity . The rate of induction failures (1.2% vs 1.4%, p=0.341, unpublished data), and the frequ ency of reported early infections (11.5 vs. 13.8%, UK unpublished data) and early severe adverse events (4.7 vs. 3.8%, UK unpublished data) were similar comparing the CNS1 and CNS2 groups. Dexamethasone and early asparaginase depletion in the induction, the use of triples as intrathecals for patients with TLP+ and high leukocyte count and slowly responding CNS2 -patients , as well as the number of intrathecals at 11 in CNS1 patients are all aimed to improv e the overall CNS control early on also in patients without overt CNS leukemia (CNS3). In addition to this, CNS2 patients will receive weekly intrathecal s until clearance of CSF blasts by cytospin in two consecutive samples, i.e. at least one extra medicat ion on day 8. CNS1 and CNS2 status will be identified in the registry for future comparisons. The cornerstone of modern ALL therapy has been prophylactic CNS -directed therapy which has used both systemic chemotherapy and locally -directed modes, such as intrathecal chemotherapy and CNS DCOG no longer use CNS irradiation prophylactically for any patient group, even those with CNS leukaemia. In contrast, CoALL has given CRT to patie nts with high measurable residual disease (MRD) at ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 124 the end of induction with either precursor B -ALL and an initial WBC count of 200/nl, or T-ALL with a WBC count of 100/nl. In a recent single -arm meta -analysis, event -free survival, cumulative incidence of isolated or any CNS relapse and isolated bone marrow relapse were evaluated in respect of the patients receiving or not receiving cranial irradiation [105] . Altogether 16,623 high risk p atients with newly diagnosed BCP or T cell ALL, aged 1 - 18 years, were treated between 1996 and 2007 by 10 cooperative study groups from around the world. The proportion of patients eligible for prophylactic CRT varied from 0% to 33% by trial. CRT was ass ociated with a reduced risk of relapse in a group of patients with CNS leukemia at diagnosis. Patients with CRT had a lower risk of isolated CNS relapse (4% vs. 17%; P = .02) and a trend toward lower risk of any CNS relapse (7% vs. 17%; P = .09) as compare d to those without CRT. This group had, however, a relatively high rate of events regardless of whether or not they received CRT, and the conclusion was that CRT does not have an impact on the risk of relapse. The long -term effects of CRT to the developing brain are well known and include endocrinopathies, late neurocognitive impairment and secondary neoplasms. At the same time, it has been shown that ALL can be cured without CRT [104] , even in T-ALL [157] . Based on these data, CRT will not be given either prophylactically, nor therapeutically to patients with CNS leukemia at diagnosis. Replacement of CRT has been evaluated by a meta -analysis of 43 studies with 8827 patients [143] and the conclusions were that CRT can be replace d by long -term intrathecal therapy, with intravenous methotrexate giving some additional benefit by reducing non -CNS relapse rate. In T-ALLs, the number of intrathecals over 10 and use of PEG -asparaginase have shown to contribute to better EFS [157] . For intrathecal therapy , triple therapy (ITT: Methotrexate, Cytarabine and a steroid) have been used, but few randomised comparisons between the two regimens have been performed. The COG -group have made two such comparisons in patients assessed as lower - and higher risk of relapse without any clear benefit for either [158, 159] . Both studies indicated a lower incidence of CNS -involving relapses in the ITT -treated patients, but this effect was offset by an increase in isolated bone marrow relapses and unchanged overall survival. None of the studies included CNS3 -patients. In the ALLTogether protocol single Methotrexate will be used for all CNS1 and CNS2 patients. ITT -therapy will be used for CNS3 -patients, patients with traumatic lumbar pu ncture with detectable blasts and an increased cell count and patients with slow response in the CSF (see section on stratification). Patients who are CNS3, CNS2 or who have a traumatic lumbar puncture with blasts (TLP+ blasts) will receive extra intrathec al doses on a weekly basis until clearance of CNS blasts in two consecutive samples, with a minimum number of 1 extra dose in CNS2 patients and 2 extra doses in patients with CNS3 and TLP+ . The stratification and extra therapy for CNS -contamination is described in Figure 12. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 125 Table 14. Dosing of single intrathecal Methotrexate and intrathecal triple therapy (ITT) by age : Drug Age 1 -<2 2-<3 3 Single Mtx dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Triple Intrathecal (ITT) dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Cytarabine 20 mg 25 mg 30 mg Alternative steroids in ITT Hydrocortisone Succinate* or 16 mg 20 mg 24 mg Prednisolone Sodium Succinate or 4 mg 5 mg 6 mg Methyl -Prednisolone Sodium Succinate 3.2 mg 4 mg 4.8 mg The table is based on the following conversion for steroids: 1 mg of Hydrocortisone = 0.25 mg of Prednisolone = 0.2 mg of Methyl -Prednisolone. All succinate salt preparations are approximated to correspond to the dose in Hydrocortisone/Prednisolone/Methyl -Prednisolone x 1.3. *Both the Hem isuccinate - and the Sodium succinate salt of Hydrocortisone can be used. In many countries, the preparations of steroids have no indication for intrathecal use and alternative preparations for other indications exist. It is therefore of utmost importance that only preparations without preservatives and without Benzyl alcohol are used. Table 15.

Six doses assumes a remaining year of Maintenance 2 therapy. 4) The number will vary depending on how many HR -blocks are administered before HSCT. 5) Depending on if Single Nelarabine or Nelarabine + remaining Consolidation 1 is administered. Special considerations for older teenagers and young adults (TYAs) The T YA group will be treated according to th e following ALLTogether treatment arms; Standard risk, intermediate -high and high -risk with HSCT. For younger SR patients (<16 years) with an anticipated EFS of 95.5%, dose de - escalation of therapy appears to be justified. However, the SR arm is already substantially dose de -escalated compared to UKALL2003 regimen B as well as the NOPHO protocols and thus there is a need to demonstrate that this arm is effective in this age group before a dose de -escalation randomisation could be considere d. Thus, T YA patients fulfilling the SR arm criteria will be treated on this arm, but not enter the randomisation . The anticipated EFS for patients meeting the criteria for the IR group is less than 80%. It is therefore not reasonable to dose de -escalat e therapy in these patients and more attractive to use innovative agents alongside conventional chemotherapy in this group. Thus T YA patients will not enter the IR -low arm and all will be treated on IR - ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 128 high therapy. TYA patients meeting the criteria fo r the HR arm is expected to have an extremely poor outcome. This group will also have a very low salvage rate after relapse as they are having predominantly early relapses. Furthermore, the UKALL 12 study [16] found a low overall survival especially in the cytogene tic high -risk group, supporting an intensive treatment for the high -risk patients. The NOPHO ALL 2008 protocol have showed similar results for the HR -chemotherapy and HR -HSCT group [14], but the high -risk group in the upcomi ng protocol is estimated to be smaller than in the NOPHO study, where some patients were allocated to HR therapy due to lack of response already at day 15 during induction, and the groups are thereby difficult to compare. For this cohort, all AYA are recommend ed treatment with HR blocks followed by allogeneic HSCT if a suitable donor (sibling or unrelated) is identified. These patients may also be eligible for CAR -T cell therapy. There is concern about the safety of combining standard chemotherapy with high doses of PEG -Asparaginase for TYA patients. Therefore, TYA patients will initially receive 1000 IU/m2 of PEG -Asparaginase throughout therapy. Activity -levels will be monitored as for other patients and safety as well as Asparaginase -activity will be assessed after the first 50 patients to assess if the dose should be increased or not. The toxicity during induction and consolidation 1 for TYA patients was examined, as a part of the ALLTogether pilot study in the NOPHO countries. In a cohort of 46 patients, there were indications of an increased frequency of thromboembolism, insulin depen dent diabetes, hepatotoxicity and, as a result, a need for modified continued treatment compared with the expected toxicity in younger patients. The toxicity profile of ALL treatment is known to be age dependent [16] and the tolerability of asparaginase early in induction has b een discussed with regard to age in adults [160] . Therefore, TYA patients 25 years of age, will start the PEG -Asparaginase therapy on day 18 (omitting the dose on day 4). However, the total number of PEG -Asparaginase doses will remain unchanged and will be administered according to the risk group of the patient - adding the initially omitted dose two weeks after the last scheduled dose for younger patients. ABL-class fusions in TYAs . A recent publication by Patel et al [160] showed a high risk of hepatotoxicity and sepsis resulting in a high early treatment related mortality for Philadelphia -positive patients treated with an induction including TKI and asparaginase. The rate of mortality was age -dependent. Therefore, the initi ation of TKI will be delayed until the end of induction for Philadelphia -like patients aged 25 years. KMT2A in TYAs Adult B -ALL patients with KMT2A is commonly recommended HSCT in CR1. Due to insufficient data, and low survival after relapse, patients 25 years may proceed to HSCT in CR1 regardless of MRD respons, according to the decision by the treating physician. Down Syndrome Patients Current Treatment Approaches ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 129 Due to the high TRM seen on UKALL 2003, several modifications were made. This include d avoiding giving anthracyclines in induction except to those with a slow morphological response ( day 15 marrow 25 % blasts) Thus all children with DS - ALL receive a 3 drug regimen (steroids, Vincristine and peg ylated asparaginase) regardless of NCI risk. Maintenance was also reduced to 2 years in boys. A recent review of induction TRM on UKALL 2011 has shown that there has been a major reduction in induction TRM (2.3 % on UKALL 2011 compared to 5.8 % on UKALL 2003). In view of a recent publication also hi ghlighting that there was a significant TRM in maintenance [36], all DS -ALL childre n with low risk MRD, do not receive Vincristine /Dexamethasone pulses in maintenance. NOPHO and COG also limit the use of anthracycline in induction and DCOG and FRALLE avoid anthracycline altogether in induction. The consolidation approach in DS -ALL varies between the different consortia. Due to the high methotrexate sensitivity and hence significant toxicity in some DS patients, all groups limit exposure to high doses of intravenous methotrexate by adopting a dose capping (500 -1000 mg/m2 with folinic acid rescue) or a cautious dose escalation strategy (starting dose, 500 -2000 mg/m2). The current UK approach is to use UKALL standard interim maintenance for standard risk DS - ALL and Capizzi interim maintenance for high risk. The COG group have previou sly demonstrated that Capizzi interim maintenance was superior to standard interim maintenance in DS - ALL (EFS 100 % vs 83.3 % p=0.02). [161] Outcomes for relapsed DS -ALL are poor, with only just under a third of relapsed DS - ALL surviving with TRM a major cause of treatment failure. [162] Therefore upfront treatment needs to be improved for children with DS -ALL and with the use of innovative strategies against novel targets. A recent update from UKALL 2011 on the 52 DS -ALL patients recruited so far has been very encouraging : (Four have had an event ; 2 relapsed at 38.3 and 24.9 months, both still alive at 52.0 and 44.4 months respectively. Two died in first remission (2.6 months) and one in induction both of neutropenic sepsis. The numbers compute as TRM 2% induction, 4% relapse = 92% overall survival with 36 months median follow -up. ALLTogether Protocol Standard Treatment for Children with Down Syndrome All DS -ALL children wi ll receive a 3 , Vincristine and pegylated asparaginase. Anthracycline will not be given regardless of NCI status. If however a day 15 bone marrow shows a slow early response in ALL ( 10% by FCM or 25 % blasts by morphology (if FCM is not available) , then in the absence of serious morbidity, DS patients should receive Daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 on day 22. Standard Risk - Down (SR-DS) arm Those children who are EOI MRD undetectable and are IKZF1 wild type will continue on the SR arm with some modifications: - Consolidation 1 will be replaced by an Interim Maintenance phase without high - dose Methotrexate. - Delayed Intensification will be according to the IR -Low arm including one dose of Cyclophosphamide. - The Maintenance phase is administered without VCR -Dexa pulses, but includes intrathecal triple therapy every 12 weeks throughout the Maintenance phase. Intermediate Risk (IR) arm Patients with detectable MRD <5% on day 29 and MRD -negative patients with IKZF1 deletion will continue on the IR -arm for Down patients. The treatment -arm is based on the IR -low therapy with the following modifications: - The Consolidation 2 and Conso lidation 3 phases are replaced by a Capizzi - element directly after Consolidation 1 (see section 13.15. 7for details) . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 130 - The Maintenance phase is administered in the fashion used for IR -high patients in cluding VCR -Dexa pulses through out the Maintenance phase. High -Risk (HR) arm Patients with MRD 5% at day 29 are considered as High -Risk. They will not be treated according to the standard HR -protocol with HR -blocks. Instead a modified therapy will be administered: - Standard Consolidation 1 will be replaced by a prolonged Consolidation 1 -phase (Augmented 1B) with divided Cyclophosphamide/6MP/Cytarabine blocks and an interim phase with Vincristine , intrathecal therapy, PEG -Asp and a response - evaluation week 9. - Patients responding to the first phase of Augmented 1 B continue according to the IR-arm therapy for DS patients . Patients who do not respond are off protocol and considered as having had a leukaemic adverse event (resistant disease). CAR -T cell therapy studies associated with ALLTogether ELIGIBILITY for CAR -T cells All patients with B-lineage ALL stratified to the HR group and lacking an ABL -class rearrangement that can be treated with a TKI, are eligible for CAR -T cell therapy. However, only part of these patients are eligible for the Novartis CASSIOPEIA study as the historical contr ol of this specific study was slightly different and more narrow ly defined. All patients will either start off with a 3 drug or 4 drug induction as per the ALL together induction schema and risk stratification. All patients in ALLTogether will be screened for ABL -class rearrangements. Patients who have such rearrangements will not be enrolled onto CAR -T cell therapy but instead will receive Imatinib and chemotherapy. Excluding those patients and patients with T cell ALL there will be around 30 potentially eligible patients per year within the ALLTogether consortium for CAR -T. Brief details of NOVARTIS CASSIOPEIA CAR -T cell trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03876769) Single arm phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Tisagenlecleucel in first line high -risk pediatric and young adult patients with B -cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who are MRD positive at the end of consolidation (EOC) therapy and who are aged 1 -25 years. This study is a collaboration between COG (US), DFCI (US), SEHOP (Spain) and ALLTogether and aims to infuse in total 160 patients. Key Inclusion criteria: NCI HR B -ALL patients aged 1 -25 years who have MRD 0.01% by centralized flowcytom etry assessment at EOC. ALLTogether patients must have received a 4 -drug induction and consolidation as per ALLTogether protocol to be eligible for CASSIOPEIA. Key Exclusion criteria: M3 marrow at EOI (day 29) or M2/M3 marrow/or persistent extramedullary disease at EOC, or hypodiploidy < 44 chromosomes. Pre-screening for CASSIOPEIA: all ATP patients aged 1 -25 years with NCI HR B -ALL and MRD0,01% at EOI (TP1) will be asked at the local ATP site to sign a separate ALLTogether consent for \"extended MRD asse ssment at EOC (TP2)\". For these patients, BM assessment on day 71 (EOC, TP2) will then consist of three MRD samples that will be collected in parallel and by the same BM aspiration procedure: (1) for local ALLTogether FCM MRD, (2) PCR MRD, for centralized FCM MRD sent to and ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 131 analyzed at the University Hospital in Oslo. Patients who have MRD0,01% by local FCM (1) and/or PCR (2), and in addition MRD0,01% confirmed by the centralized FCM in Oslo (3), will be immediately offered transfer to one of the CASSIOPEIA study sites for CASSIOPEIA study consent and screening investigations. Down syndrome patients are eligible for CASSIOPEIA as long as they were \"NCI HR\" at diagnosis (age 10 y and/or WBC 50), have received the 4 -drug induction and are MRD+ according to the above -mentioned criteria at the end of the modified consolidation (day 99, TP2). DS patients who received the 3 - drug induction, or DS patients taken \"off protocol\" at day 57 due to lack of response, are not eligible for CASSIOPEIA. Due to wash -out requirements of chemotherapy and other drugs hampering T-cell quality and quantity before T -cell collection, leukapheresis can only be performed at the end of Consolidation 1. The leukapheresis procedure needs to be perfor med at an accredited CASSIOPEIA apheresis site. Bridging chemotherapy after leukapheresis will consist of a modified Consolidation 2 phase of the IR -high protocol (6 -Mercaptopurine, no PEG -asparaginase due wash - out requirements). Lymphodepletion with Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide will be given 2 -14 days prior CAR -T cell infusion. The patient will formally leave ALLTogether protocol treatment (\"off -protocol\") when the lymphodepleting chemotherapy i s started. Patients will be offered a second CAR -T cell infusion in case of early B -cell recovery (defined as absolute CD19+ cell count of >50/L within 6 months of initial infusion (according to the central lab), or MRD positivity with CD19 expression (defined as MRD0.01% as assessed by centralised FCM in Oslo) at any time during the study participation. Follow -up After the CAR -T infusion the patient will be followed in both the respective CAR -T study and in ALLTogether 1 from when the patient can be discharged from the hospital where the CAR -T infusion was performed. Leukaemic adverse events (relapse of ALL, death in CR1 or SMN) occurring during the CAR -T therapy will be recorded retrospectively also in the ALLTogether da tabase - and prospectively when the patient returns for continued follow -up in ALLTogether1. This follow -up will include basic data also after primary adverse events to assess secondary end -points, for instance overall survival in an adequate way, but only elementary registration of therapy after primary events will be recorded .

SCREENING AND CONSEN T PROCEDURE 11.1 Pre - screening to the Master Protocol and biobanking All patients with potential diagnosis of T -lineage or precursor -B (BCP) ALL aged between 1 and 45 years will be pre -screened for entry into the ALLTogether study . Patients will be included into the study if a confirmed diagnosis of ALL has been made, in clusion criteria are fulfilled, exclusion criteria are absent and informed consent has been obtained. During the pre -screening period, the clinical activity is normally high and will continue with multiple diagnostic procedures in accordance with standa rd care for any patient with a query of acute leukaemia. In order to promote the scientific aims of the study, it is mandatory to try to biobank leukaemic and constitutional cells from all accessible locations. However, since the diagnosis is not confirm ed at the time of diagnosis, the study will have to utilise pre - existing routines in the diagnostic departments for biobanking of bone -marrow and blood for clin ical or other research purposes in order to secure material for biobanking within the study with out having to perform extra bone -marrow investigations and lumbar punctures. After all relevant clinical work -up has been performed and informed consent has been obtained, the biobanked samples can be assigned to the study as designated biobank sample wi thin the study. Handled in this way, the study specific sampling will not cause any extra harm since the samples are collected at the same time as investigations for clinical reasons. If a pre -screened patient/parents/legal/guardian(s) does not agree to participate in the study, the biobanked samples are not kept for ALLTogether study -purposes, but may be kept as clinical back -up, for other research or destroyed - all depending on the routines at the centre. All pre - screened patients will be documented on a pre - screening log (non - identifying information). In case of a pre - screening failure, the reason for failure should be documented in the log. 11.2 Patient Information and Informed consent A Patient Information Sheet (PIS), which describes the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation will be given to the patient/parents/legal guardians by the treating investigator or delegate at the diagnosing centre (see below). A signed Informed Consent Form (I CF) has to be obtained from each patient. Since most patients cannot consent themselves because of low age, the consent form has to be signed by a person with power of attorney (normally the parents/legal guardians). This also applies to old er patients unable to consent themselves. Consent from young patients will be obtained according to country -specific guidelines provided at: http://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/early/2016/05/25/archdischild - 2015 -310001.full.pdf?keytype=ref&ijkey=0ozuUFBDhOiruxr . It is the responsibility of the Investigator (or delegate if this duty has been delegated to a suit ably qualified individual) to give out the PIS, sign and obtain written informed ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 135 consent from the patient/parents/legal guardians prior to performing any study related procedure. Investigators (or delegate) must ensure that they adequately explain the ai m, study treatment, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of taking part in the study to the patient. The Investigator (or delegate) should also emphasise that the patient is completely free to refuse to take part or withdraw from the study at any tim e without any consequence to the medical care of the patient. The patient/parents/legal guardians should be given ample time (7 days from date of diagnosis) to read the PIS and to discuss their participation with others outside of the site research team. They must be given an opportunity to ask questions which should be answered to their satisfaction. The right of the patient/parents/legal guardians to refuse to participate in the study without giving a reason must be respected. If the patient is eligible and informed consent has been obtained, the patient should be registered within 14 days from diagnosis. There will be multiple/separate Patient Information Sheets and Informed Consent Forms in the ALLTogether study. At the time of diagnosis, there is a P IS and an ICF for the Master protocol. When/if a patient is a suitable candidate for any of the intervention parts or any other sub -study there will be a separate PIS and ICF for each randomisation /intervention or sub -study. Age -specific Patient Informatio n Sheets will be provided to older children for the Master Protocol and each randomisation or sub - study. The legal age of consent, mandatory/suggested age ranges defined for consent for a child, number of required signatures from parent(s) /guardian(s) is dependent on national regulations and 16/05/25/archdischild -2015 - 310001.full.pdf?keytype=ref&ijkey=0ozuUFBDhOiruxr . A patient/parent/legal guardian who expresses an interest in participating in the study should be asked to sign and date the latest version of the applicable I CF. The Investi gator (or delegate) should then sign and date the form. A copy of the signed ICF should be given to the patient/parents/legal guardians, a copy should be filed in the hospital notes, and the original placed in the Investigator Site File (ISF) . Once the patient is entered into the study the patient will obtain a patient number from the eCRF -system. The patient's study number should be entered on the Informed Consent Form for future reference. Details of the informed consent discussions should be recorded in the patient's medical notes . This should also include the date consent was given, the name of the study and the version number of the Parent/ Patient Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form. Throughout the study the patient/parents/legal guardians should have the opportunity to ask questions about the study and any new information that may be relevant to the patient's continued participation should be shared with them in a timely manner. In case of implementation of any substantially changed versions of the PIS, it may be necessary to re -consent the patient in which case the process described above should be repeated. The patient's right to withdraw from the study at later time -points should al ways be respected. Electronic copies of templates of the PI Ss and ICF s should be available from the national Clinical Trial Unit and should be printed or photocopied onto the headed paper of the local centre. Details (local patient identification, study -number and date of enrolment /withdrawal ) ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 136 of all patients included into the study should be recorded on the Patient Enrolment Log. The ALLTogether protocol includes the Master protocol and sub -protocols interventions that includes randomisations (R1, R2 and R3 - InO) and one non- randomised experimental intervention integrated into the protocol (Imatinib for patients with ABL -class fusions : NRI1). The patient/parents/legal guardians should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the patient\u00b4s willingness to continue participation in the study. The communication of this information should be documented. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 137 12. STUDY ENTRY AND RANDOMISAT ION PROCESS 12.1 Study entry Patients can be registered in the study once the ALLTogether Trial Central Office and the National Clinical Trials Unit have confirmed that all regulatory requirements have been met by the centre . Once all eligibility criteria are met and informed consent has been obtained, the patient will be enrolled and registered in the study. The informed consent process and p atient registration must be completed before any study -specific activity can occur. These processes must never interfere with the adequate medical care of the patients. 12.2 Patient numbering Each eligible patient in the Master protocol is uniquely identified by a study subject number generated by the Electronic Case Report Form system. Once assigned to a patient, the subject number will not be re -used. Randomi sation system This is an open label study. When a patient is eligible and the patient/ parents/legal guardians have signed the informed consent for a specific randomisation , the investigator or authorized centre staff will contact the randomisation system and provide the requested identifying information. The randomisation system generates a randomised treatment assignment and present s it to the investigator or authori sed centre staff in the system. A copy of each randomisation result should be printed and retained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) and patient's medical record . The document may be scanned and filed electronically, if electronic patient records are used. The randomisation procedure ensure s that the treatment assignment is unbiased for patients and investigator staff. The \"minimization\" randomisation method will be used to ensure that multiple factors that may influence the results will be as balance d as possible between the groups . The facto rs used in the model will vary slightly between the randomisations, but will for all randomisation s include country, age -group and sex. For the randomisations including TYAs, the treating clinic (paediatric and adult haematology) will also be taken into ac count. Specific details about the randomi sation procedures in the randomisations are provided in the separa te protocols. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 138 13. TREATMENT DETAILS 13.1 Induction Therapy Overview Repeat of Figure 7. Algorithm for choice of Induction therapy Intrathecal therapy From Table 14: Dosing of intrathecal single Methotrexate and intrathecal triple therapy (ITT) by age: Age 1 -<2 2-<3 3 Single Mtx dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Triple Intrathecal (ITT) dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Cytarabine 20 mg 25 mg 30 mg Alternative steroids in ITT Hydrocortisone Succinate* or 16 mg 20 mg 24 mg Prednisolone Sodium Succinate or 4 mg 5 mg 6 mg Methyl -Prednisolone Sodium Succinate 3.2 mg 4 mg 4.8 mg *Both the Hemisuccinate - and the Sodium succinate salt of Hydrocortisone can be used. In many countries, the preparations of steroids have no indication for intrathecal use and alternative preparations for other indications exist. It is therefore of utmo st importance that only preparations without preservatives and without Benzyl alcohol are used. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 139 13.2 Induction A - NCI Standard -Risk patients (3 -drug induction) Eligible Patients: This regimen is the initial therapy for patients with NCI Low -Risk ALL. Thus, patients starting on Induction A must have: - BCP immunophenotype and - be before their 10th birthday at diagnosis and - have a highest white cell count before starting treatment of <50x109/L. 13.3 Induction B - NCI High -Risk patients and T -cell (4 - drug induction) Eligible Patients: Induction B is the initial therapy for patients with: - BCP ALL aged 10 years at diagnosis and/or - a highest white cell count before starting treatment of 50x109/L or - T-cell ALL In addition, Induction B is also used for any patients known to have high -risk genetic changes at the start of their treatment. However, this is likely to be a rare situation. Most NCI low -risk patients with high -risk genetic changes, will start Inductio n A and are shifted to Induction C from day 15/16 (see below), when the high -risk genetic changes are found. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 140 13.4 Induction C - Patients with initial NCI Standard - Risk and with high -risk genetic lesions Eligible Patients: Induction C is for BCP patients, w ith NCI low -risk, who started on Induction A, but were found to carry high -risk genetic lesions: in the leukaemic clone for patients with: - KMT2A or - hypodiploid ALL (<40 chromosomes) or - iAMP21 Patients are shifted from Induction A to Induction C from day 15/16. 13.5 Induction D - Patients with Down syndrome Eligible Patients: Induction D is for patients with Down syndrome regardless of: - age - WBC at diagnosis - genetic changes in the leukaemic clone Therapy starts without Daunorubicin (DNR), but DNR is added on day 16 if poor response to initial therapy (25% MRD on day 15). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 141 13.6 Induction E - Patients <25 years at diagnosis and initial NCI Standard -Risk and with ABL -class fusions in the leukaemic clone Eligible Patients: Induction E is for patients <25 years at diagnosis with NCI low -risk, who started on Induction A, but were found to carry an ABL -class fusion in the leukaemic clone. Patients are shifted from Induction A to Induction E from day 15. Heart function should be adequate and the corrected QT -interval must be <480ms for Imatinib to start. If this was the case in the screening cardiac assessment, no new assessment is necessary. Se protocol g uidelines for dose -adaption of Imatinib due to toxicity. 13.7 Induction F - Patients <25 years at diagnosis and initial NCI High -Risk and with ABL -class fusions in the leukaemic clone Eligible Patients: Induction F is for patients <25 years at diagnosis with NCI high -risk, who started on Induction B, but were found to carry an AB L-class fusion in the leukaemic clone ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 142 Patients are shifted from Induction B to Induction F from day 15. NB! Patients 25 years with ABL -class fusions do not use Induction F. They remain on Induction B (mandatory DNR because of age) and start IMA from Con solidation 1. Heart function should be adequate and the corrected QT -interval must be <480ms for Imatinib to start. If this was the case in the screening cardiac assessment, no new assessment is necessary. Se protocol g uidelines for dose -adaption of Imati nib A -F Dexamethasone 6 mg/m2/day, given orally (iv preparations are allowed if the patient is too ill to take oral medication), divided into two to three doses on days 1 -28, then tapered over 7 -10 days. In cases of high tumour burden and signs of TLS, a pre - phase using increasing do ses of Prednisolone (15 -60 mg/m2/day) is allowed - see TLS guidelines (optional ) or national guidelines , but is not generally recommended. When the TLS is under control and the steroid dose no longer has to be reduced, the patient should be switched to ful l dose Dexamethasone and start the rest of the induction phase therapy. Vincristine (VCR) Induction A -F 1.5 mg/m2 (maximum single dose 2 mg) intravenous (IV) injection or short infusion, weekly for four weeks starting on day 1 and continuing on days 1, 8, 15, 22. It is allowed to postpone the VCR -dose (to days 2, 9, 16 and 23) to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. Daunorubicin (DNR) Induction B,C,D,F Daunorubicin 25 mg/m2/dose IV, one hour infusion on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in In duction B and F. Daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/dose IV, one hour infusion on days 16 and 23 in Induction C and on day 16 (day 17 if FCM -MRD has to be awaited) in Induction D. Echocardiography is recommended before the first dose, but may for practical reasons be postponed to after the first dose in the absence of cardiac symptoms. Pegylated - Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour, on days 4 and 18 (only day 18 for patients 25 years) . In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20 000 IU/m2/dose will be given IV (or IM) over one hour every second day for a total of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp. Asparaginase a ctivity monitoring (see 'TDM ASP guidelines') is used to detect inactivation/distinguish between reactions with and without inactivation. Intrathecal therapy Induction A -F Intrathecal therapy, dosing by age according to Table 14 and below. Imatinib (IMA) This is an IMP Induction E,F For patients <25 years old at diagnosis: Imatinib 340 mg/m2/day orally (max dose: 600/800mg/day), starting from day 15 and then given continuously unless therapy -response to IMA is considered insufficient resulting in stratification to HR -therapy with allo -SCT (see below). Patients 25 years at diagnosis start Im atinib from Consolidation 1. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 143 General considerations and supportive care for induction therapy Stabilising measures are extremely important, but should not delay the start of therapy unduly, since only treatment of the underlying leukaemia will ultimately improve the condition of the patient. Prevention and treatment of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) : For the management of large tumour burden and prevention and treatment of TLS, see TLS-guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines. All patients should be well hydrated (2.5 -4.5 L/m2/24hrs) and have adequate diuresis before the start of treatment. If kidney function is severely impared through leukaemic infiltration of kidneys or spontaneous TLS, dialysis may have to be instituted at the same time as therapy is started. Patients at moderate risk of TLS may be managed with only fluids and Allopurinol, whereas patients at higher risk may require Rasburicase (Urate oxidase). If Rasburicase is administered, Allopurinol should be avoided or stopped. Symptoms due to bone -marrow failure: All patients will ALL will have some degree of bone -marrow failure and may require transfusions of platelets and erythrocytes to treat or prevent bleeding and optimise oxygen uptake. In addition to platelet transfusion, the leukaemia may in itself cause coagulopathy that may need correction. Erythrocytes should b e administered with caution in c ase of signs of hyperviscosity - see TLS-guidelines (optional ) or national/local guidelines . are frequently required to treat neutropenic fever/infection. BM-examinations BM examination day 1 represents the dia gnostic investigation and may in exceptional cases be replaced by examination of peripheral blood (see section 6.1). BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 29. An additional, BM - examination is strongly recommended on day 15 (for assessm ent of early treatment response and assessment of modification of immunophenotype expression pattern, which may be used in the MRD -analysis by FCM). The day 15 BM -examination is mandatory for patients with Down syndrome and is also stratifying, since the administration of DNR day 16 depends on this result. Intrathecal therapy during induction A single Mtx -injection should always be administered at the time of the diagnostic lumbar puncture. Patients with CNS1 and TLP without leukaemic cells (TLP -) continue with single Mtx day 15 (and throughout the protocol). Patients with CNS2 without TLP or TLP with leukaemic cells confirmed by cytospin possibly aided by FCM (TLP+) with low cell count (<5 cells/microL) receive extra single Mtx day 8 and a regular single Mtx dose day 15. If the CSF is cleared of leukaemic cells day 15, these patients will receive single Mtx throughout therapy. Patients with CNS3 and TLP with leukaemic cells confirmed by cytospin possibly aided by FCM (TLP+) and increased cell coun t (5 cells/microL) receive ITTs day 8 (extra) and day 15. Patients with initial CNS3 or TLP+ with 5cells/microL CSF at diagnosis and patients with initial CNS2 -status who do not clear the CSF by day 15 receive at least another extra ITT day 22 (and rec eive ITT throughout the protocol). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 144 PEG -Asp toxicity: Asparaginase may cause serious side -effects, notably pancreatitis, liver -toxicity and thrombosis. Before each administration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment with these complications in mind and the therapy may have to be withheld if such complications are diagnosed or suspected or to further assess the situation. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been instituted a nd the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy. Imatinib (IMA) toxicity: Please, see protocol g uidelines for dose -adaptation of Imatinib (IMA) due to toxicity. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia Standard PJ P-prophylaxis with Co -trimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole) should be administered from day 1 and throughout therapy . Different regimens exist, local or national guidelines should be applied. In case of intolerance/allergy to co-trimoxazole, use Pentamidine, Dapsone or Atovaquone. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 145 13.9 Post -induction Standard Risk Treatment Summary TREATMENT PHASE DURATION DETAILS OF TREATMENTS/RANDOMISATIONS Consolidation 1 6 weeks (weeks 5 -10) Consolidation 2 7 weeks (weeks 11 -17) Delayed Intensification 7 weeks (weeks 18 -24) Randomisation 1. With and without Anthracycline (Doxorubicin) Maintenance Continues for exactly 2 years from the start of consolidation 1 Arm R1 Delayed Intensification Standard Arm With Doxorubicin Experimental Arm Without Doxorubicin From Table 14: Dosing of single Methotrexate 2-<3 3 Single Mtx dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 146 Standard Risk: Consolidation 1 BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 29 (TP1) Eligible patients: This protocol is used for SR-stratified patients . SR-patients fulfil all the following criteria: - no detectable MRD -signal at day 29 - BCP -ALL - no HR -genetics /ABL -class fusions (for definition see T able 9) no CNS3 or TLP+ at diagnosis NB! SR-strati fied patients will not have any additional stratifying BM -examinations. This phase runs for 6 weeks from day 29 (beginning of week 5) to day 70 inclusive (end of week 10). 13.9.2.1 Starting -criteria VCR and ITT -therapy on day 29 (for VCR alternatively day 30) are administered without considering peripheral blood counts - only the general condition of the patient. The platelet count should be adequate (refer to local/national guidelin es) at the time of lumbar puncture, but platelets may be transfused to achieve this. Even in the case of complications during induction therapy, BM assessment on protocol day 29 is very important, since it is the basis for the stratification and should be performed on the day of the administration of day 29 chemo. The PEG -Asp on day 32 and 46 are administered regardless of when 6MP and the subsequent ARA -C doses are started. Before each administration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and n o signs of pancreatitis, severe hepatic toxicity or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been instituted and the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy - see guidelines on thrombosis and antithrombotic prophylaxis (optional when: WBC is 1.5x109/L or - ANC is 0.5 x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L and rising. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 147 13.9.2.2 Antileukaemic therap y Standard Risk Consolidation 1 Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone tapering during 7 -10 days from day 29. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on day 29. It is allowed to postpone the VCR -dose one day (to day 30) to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2 day given orally days 36 -63 (in total 28 days). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be 5 mg/m2. Cytarabine (ARA -C) Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose IV injection , given on days 38 - 41, 45 -48, 52 and -Asp) 1500 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on days 32 and 46. For patients 25 at diagnosis a dose will be give also on day 60. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20 000 IU/m2/dose will be given IV (or IM) over one hour every second day for a total of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp. Asparaginase activity monitoring (see 'TDM ASP Guidelines ') is used to detect inactivation/distinguish between reactions with and without inactiv ation. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", on days 29 and 52. 13.9.2.3 General con siderations and supportive care Once 6MP has been started, the Consolidation I ( SR) will continue uninterrupted regardless of blood counts/need of transfusion, but may be interrupted because of infection, pancreatitis or other clinical problems. If possible, the ARA -C blocks should not be interrupted. If nevertheless an ARA -C block has to be postponed or interrupted because of clinical problems, the 6 -MP should also be interrupted. Omitted 6 -MP doses should be made up until the planned cumulative total dose of 1680 mg/m2 (28 x 60 mg/m2) is reached. If no contra -indication for the administration of PEG -Asp exists, PEG -Asp should be administered even if the 6 -MP and ARA -C have been interrupted. Conversely, 6 -MP and ARA -C should be administered if there are no contra -indications to these drugs, even if PEG -Asp is not administered due to Asp -specific contra -indications. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 148 Standard Risk: Consolidation 2 Eligible patients: SR-stratification. This phase runs for 7 weeks from day 71 (beginning of week 11) to day 119 inclusive (end of week 17). 13.9.3.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection. Before the start of 6MP: - WBC should be >1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelets >50x109/L and rising. Each dose of HD-MTX can be given, when: - ANC is >0.5x109/L and - platelets are >50x109/L and rising and - renal function should be normal and - aminotransferases should not exceed >10 x the ULN. - Patients should be free of significant infection, diarrhoea, mucositis and effusions (second compartments). Prior to starting the second course of HD -MTX, at least serum creatinine should be measured. If it has not returned to normal, GFR should be assessed and should be >70mL/minute/1.73m2. This is particularly important if kidney function was impaired during previous courses or the M TX-excretion was prolonged. However, prolonged MTX-excretion during previous courses is not in itself a contra -indication for continued HD -MTX-therapy. If the platelet count falls below 30x109/L or the ANC falls below 0.2x109/L after the HD-MTX -courses, the 6 -MP should be temporarily discontinued and re-started when both counts rise above these limits again. 6 -MP should always be started at the latest when the second HD -MTX course is starting, but then the starting -criteria have to be fulfilled. 13.9.3.2 Antileukaemic therap y Standard Risk Consolidation 2 6- Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-MP 25 mg/m2/day given orally days 71 -119 (weeks 11 -17). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should 5 mg/m2. HD-Methotrexate (HD-MTX) Methotrexate 5000 mg/m2 is given as a 24 -hour continuous infusion on days 78 and 99. 10% of the dose is administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% in the following 23 hours. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 149 All patients must be pre -hydrated as per HD-MTX guidelines (optional) or national/local gu idelines . Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Folinic acid 15mg/m2 of the racemic preparation or 7.5mg/m2 of the L - isomeric product intravenously at 42, 48 and 54 hours after the start of each Methotrexate infusion. The dose of Folin ic acid and the hydration should be adjusted according to the Mtx - concentration and kidney function . Hyperhydration and 6- hourly Folinic acid rescue should be continued until the Mtx - concentration is <0.2 micromol/L . Do not cap the Folinic acid dose. Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Extreme MTX -concentration and severely impaired kidney function may indicate the use of Carboxy -peptidase. Refer to Carboxypeptidase guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", on days 78 and 99. 13.9.3.3 General considerations and supportive care Drug interactions Drugs which compromise renal function, e.g. aminoglycosides and non -steroid anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAID) , can decrease clearance of methotrexate and lead to systemic toxicity and should therefore be avoided during this phase. Methotrexate clearance is also hampered by proton -pump inhibitors, which should also be avoided. 13.9.3.4 Randomisation 1 (R1) Patients may be screened for eligibility for R1 and randomised f rom day 106. Patients who have not had an initial screen for cardiac function, should have this before randomisation. The administration of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) carries significant potential toxicity which in extreme cases can be fatal. This is prevented by effective folinic acid rescue. Absolute compliance with the schedule of hydration, monitoring of levels and folinic acid rescue is mandatory in this phase of the protocol. It is vital to rea d this section of the protocol before commencing administration of HDMTX . Please als o ensure that you have made certain that your patient has no contraindication to HDMTX. Please note that to be eligible for entry into this phase renal function should be within normal limits corrected for age. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 150 Standard Risk: Delayed Intensification Standard arm with Doxorubicin Eligible patients: This part of the SR protocol applies to: - patients randomised to the control arm i n randomisation 1 (R1) with Doxorubicin in Delayed Intensifiation. - patients not taking part in the R1 randomisation. - patients 16 years at diagnosis. This phase runs for 7 weeks from day 120 (beginning of week 18) to day 168 inclusive (end week 24). 13.9.4.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection. Patients who have not had an initial screen for cardiac function, should be assessed by ECG and echocardiogra m. In addition - WBC should be 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising to start this phase. Once begun, therapy during weeks 18 - 21 is not interrupted for myelosuppression alone. The starting criteria for the 6 -MP/Ara -C block on day 148 (the beginning of week 22) are - ANC 0.3 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising. Once begun th erapy during weeks 22 -23 should not be interrupted sole ly because of myelosuppression, but may b e interrupted because of serious infection, neutropenic fever or other complications. 13.9.4.2 Antileukaemic therapy Standard Risk Delayed Intensification : Part 1, weeks 18 -21 Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2/day given orally, divided in 2 -3 doses for 7 days on days 120 -126 and day 134 -140.

ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 151 Doxorubicin (DOX) If the patient takes part in Randomisation 1 (R1) this is an IMP Doxorubicin 30 mg/m2/dose IV, one hour infusion on days 120, 127 and 134. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", on days 120 and 134. Part 2, weeks 22 -24 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2/day given orally , once daily, days 148 -161 (in total 14 days). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be 5 mg/m2. Cytarabine (ARA -C) Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose IV push, given on days 149 -152 and 156 -159. 13.9.4.3 General considerations This is the control arm of the R1 randomisation. Patients included in R1 have extended reporting of toxicity for secondary end -points to the randomisation. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 152 Standard Risk Delayed Intensification experimental Arm without Doxorubicin Eligible patients: This part of the SR protocol applies to: - Patients randomised to the experimental arm in randomisation 1 (R1) without Doxorubicin in Delayed Intensifi cation . This phase runs for 7 weeks from day 120 (beginning of week 18) to day 168 inclusive (end week 24). 13.9.5.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection. To start this phase: - WBC should be 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising Once begun, therapy during weeks 18 - 21 is not interrupted for myelosuppression alone. The starting criteria for the 6 -MP/Ara -C block on day 148 (the beginning of week 22) are: - ANC 0.3 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising. Once begun this phase should not be interrupted solely because of myelosuppression , but it may be interrupted because of serious infection, neutropenic fever or other complications. 13.9.5.2 Antileukaemic therapy Standard Risk Delayed Intensification Part 1, weeks 18 -21 Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2/day given orally, divided in 2 -3 doses for 7 days on days 120 -126 and day 134 -140. No tapering needed (be aware of signs of adrenal insufficiency). Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine given at 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on days 120, 127 and 134. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", on days 120 and 134. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 153 Part 2, weeks 22 -24 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2/day given orally , once d aily, days 148 -161 (in total 14 days).

Cytarabine (ARA -C) Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose IV push, given on days 149 -152 and 156 -159. 13.9.5.3 General considerations - experimental arm This is the experimental arm of Randomisation 1 (R1). Since none of the drugs used in the first part of the phase (weeks 18 -20) are myelotoxic, it may seem tempting to lower the starting -criteria for the beginning of the DI -phase. For the sake of making the randomised groups comparable, this is strictly forbidden. Patients included in R1 have extended reporting of toxicity for secondary end - points to the randomisation. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 154 Standard Risk: Maintenance Eligible patients: SR-stratification. The Maintenance phase runs in 12 -week cycles from the beginning of week 25 for 36 weeks (until the end of week 61 ) and continuously after that until t reatment is stopped exactly 2 years from the start of consolidation 1. Once maintenance is started the clock does not stop regardless of whether treatment is given or not. Only 6-Mercaptopurine and oral Methotrexate will be interrupted for myelosuppression and the time is not be made up. Days off therapy for intercurrent infections are counted as days of maintenance and thus no compensation is made for interruptio ns in treatment. 13.9.6.1 Starting criteria Maintenance is started when: - ANC is 0.75x109/L and - platelets are 75x109/L. 13.9.6.2 Antileukaemic therapy Standard Risk Maintenance 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine, initial dose 75 mg/m2/day orally , once daily up to 2 years from complete remission (25 months / 108 weeks from diagnosis ). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. Maintenance doses will be adjusted to keep the ANC level between 0.75 -1.5 x109/L. Methotrexate (MTX) Methotrexate, initial dose 20 mg/m2/week orally is continued until the end of therapy (25 months /108 weeks from diagnosis ) and is titrated together with 6 - mercaptopu rine. During the week when intrathecal therapy is given the oral dose is omitted or adjusted to an appropriate total dose depending on the size of the patient . Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", given once at the start of Maintenance (week 25, day 169 ) and 12 -weekly for an additional two doses (week 37 and week 49) . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 155 13.9.6.3 General considerations and supportive care For detailed instructions on the stee ring of Maintenance -therapy refer to the protocol Maintenance guidelines . Anaemia occurring in the course of maintenance therapy should be treated with transfusion and the dose of drug maintained. If persistent (> 4 weeks) anaemia occurs , investigate for Parvovirus or other infection. 6MP and MTX should be given at a regular schedule, but there are no restrictions as to the circadian schedule or to dosing in relation to intake of food (including milk products).

From the 2x2 factorial design, the alternative with double de - intensification will be dropped. Three arms remain: - the standard /control arm (with Doxo rubicin in DI and with VCR -Dexa pulses in Maintenance ), - experimental arm A (without Doxorubicin in DI and with pulses in Maintenance ), and - experimental arm B (with Doxorubicin in DI and without pulses in Maintenance ). From Table 14: Dosing of Methotrexate 2-<3 3 Single Mtx dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 157 IR-Low Risk: Consolidation 1 BM-examination for stratification will be performed on day 29 (TP1) Since the stratification may change after MRD -evaluation at TP2, this stratification is provisional. Eligible patients: This protocol is used for IR -low statified patients - Such patients fulfil the following criteria : - no HR -genetics and - no CNS3 and - no TLP(+) with 5 leukocytes/microL CSF and - no patients 16 years at diagnosis. In addition, IR-Low patients have MRD values below the cut -off for their genetic group: - ETV6 -RUNX1 - ly stratified to IR -therapy . Consolidation 1 runs for 6 weeks from day 29 (beginning of week 5) to day 70 inclusive (end of week 10). Starting -criteria VCR and ITT -therapy on day 29 (for VCR alternatively day 30) are administered without considering peripheral blood counts - only the general condition of the patient. The platelet count should be adequate (refer to local/national guidelines) at the time of lumbar puncture, but platelets may be transfused to achieve this. Even in the case of complications during induction therapy, BM assessment day 29 is very important, since it is the basis for the stratification and should be performed on the day of the administration of day 29 chemo therapy . The PEG -Asp on day 32 and 46 are administered regardless of when 6MP and the subsequent ARA -C doses are started. Before each administration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and no signs of pancreatitis, severe hepatic toxicity or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been instituted and the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy - see see guidelines on thrombosis and antithrombotic prophylaxis (optional ) or national/local (CPM) started when: - WBC is 1.5x109/L or - ANC is 0.5 x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L and rising. The starting criteria for the second cyclophosphamide (and the rest of the block) are - WBC 1.0x109/L or - ANC 0.3 x109/L (Dexa) Dexamethasone tapering during 7 -10 days from day 29. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on day 29. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid g iving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2 day given orally days 36 -63 (in total 28 days). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should 5 mg/m2. Cyclophosphamide (CPM) Cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 over 30 -60 min will be given on days 36 and 50. Hydration and Mesna before and after Cyclophosphamide according to national guidelines. Cytarabine (ARA -C) Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose IV injection , given on days 38 - 41, 45 -48, 52 and -Asp) 1500 IU/m2 given IV (or IM) over one hour on days 32, 46 and 60. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20 000 IU/m2/dose will be given IV (or IM) over one hour every second day for a total of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp. Asparaginase activity monitoring (seeTDM ASP guidelines ) is used to detect inactivation/distinguish between reactions with and without inactivati on. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", on days 29, 36 and 50. 13.10.2.2 General con siderations and supportive care Once 6MP + Cyclophosphamide has been started, the Consolidation I (SR) will continue uninterrupted regardless of blood counts/need of transfusion, but may be interrupted because of infection, pancreatitis or other clinical problems. If possible, the ARA -C blocks should not be interrupted. If nevertheless an ARA -C block has to be postponed or interrupted because of clinical problems, the 6 - mercaptopurine should also be interrupted. Omitted 6 -mercaptopurine doses should be made up until the planned cumulative total dose of 1680 mg/m2 (28 x 60 mg /m2) is reached. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 159 If no contra -indication for the administration of PEG -Asp exists, PEG -Asp should be administered even if the 6 -MP and ARA -C have been interrupted. Conversely, 6 -MP and ARA -C should be administered if there are no contra -indications to the se drugs, even if PEG -Asp is not administered due to Asp -specific contra -indications. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 160 IR-Low Risk: Consolidation 2 BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 71 (TP2) Eligible patients: - BCP -patients who are candidates for -low stratification have been identified at TP1 (point 12.4.3) and must have MRD < 0.05% at TP2 to IR TP2 are re-stratified MRD 0.05% TP2 to with allo -SCT. Patients, who have persistent testicular disease or mediastinal mass that has not reduced to <1/3 of the initial volume are re -stratified after TP2 to HR -therapy (BCP - patients) or HR -therapy with allo -SCT (T -cell patients). Consolidation 2 runs for 7 weeks from day 71 (beginning of week 11) to da y 119 inclusive (end of week17). 13.10.3.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection. Before the start of 6MP: - WBC should be 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising. Each dose of HD-MTX can be given, when: - ANC is >0.5x109/L and - platelets are >50x109/L and rising and - Renal function should be normal and - aminotransferases should not exceed >10 x the ULN and - Patients should be free of significant infection, diarrhoea, mucositis and effusions (second compartments). Prior to starting the second course of HDMTX , at least serum creatinine should be measured. If it has not returned to normal, GFR should be assessed and should be >70mL/minute/1.73 m2. This is particularly important if kidney function was impaired during previous courses or the Mtx -excretion was prolonged. However, prolonged Mtx-excretion during previous courses is not in itself a contra -indica tion for continued HDMTX -therapy. If the platelet count falls below 30x109/L or the ANC falls below 0.2x109/L after the HD-MTX -courses, the 6 -MP should be temporarily discontinued and re-started when both counts rise above these limits again. 6 -MP should always be started at the latest ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 161 when the second HD -MTX course is starting, but then the starting -criteria have to be fulfilled. 13.10.3.2 Antileukaemic 25 mg/m2/day given orally days 71 -119 (weeks 11 -17). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should 5 mg/m2. HD-Methotrexate (HD-MTX) Methotrexate 5000 mg/m2 is given as a 24 -hour continuous infusion on days 78 and 99. 10% of the dose is administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% in the following 23 hours. All patients must be prehydrated as per HD-MTX guidelines (optional) or national/local gui delines . Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Folinic acid 15mg/m2 of the racemic preparation or 7.5mg/m2 of the L - isomeric product intravenously at 42, 48 and 54 hours after the start of each Methotrexate infusion. The dose of Folini c acid and the hydration should be adjusted according to the Mtx-concentration and kidney function and Folinic acid rescue should be continued 6 -hourly until the Mtx - concentration is <0.2 micromol/L. Do not cap the dose. Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Extreme Mtx -concentration and severely impaired kidney function may indicate the use of Carboxy -peptidase. Refer to Carboxypeptidase guidelines (optional) or national/local Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", on days 78 and 99. 13.10.3.3 General considerations and supportive care Drug interactions Drugs which compromise renal function, e.g. aminoglycosides and non -steroid anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAID), can decrease clearance of methotrexate and lead to systemic toxicity and should therefore be avoided during this phase. Methotrexate clearance is also hampered by proton -pump inhibitors, which should also be avoided. 13.10.3.4 Randomisation 2 (R2) Patients may be screened for eligibility for R1 and randomised from day 106. Patients who have not had an initial screen for cardiac function, should have this before randomisation. The administration of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) carries significant potential toxicity which in extreme cases can be fatal. This is prevented by effective folinic acid rescue. Absolute compliance with the schedule of hydration, monitoring of levels and folinic acid rescue is mandatory in this phase of the protocol. It is vital to rea d this section of the protocol before commencing administration of HDMTX . Please als o ensure that you have made certain that your patient has no contraindication to HDMTX. Please note that to be eligible for entry into this phase renal function should be within normal limits corrected for age.

This phase runs for 7 weeks from day 120 (beginning of week 18) to day 168 inclusive (end week 24). 13.10.4.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection. Patients who have not had an initial screen for cardiac function, should be assessed by ECG and echocardiogram. In addition - WBC should be 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising to start this phase. Once begun, therapy during weeks 18 - 21 is not interrupted for myelosuppression alone.

ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 169 13.10.7.2 (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine, initial dose 75 mg/m2/day orally up to 2 years from complete remission (25 months, 108 weeks). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT - deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. Maintenance doses will b e adjusted to keep the ANC level between 0.75 -1.5 x109/L. Methotrexate (MTX) Methotrexate, initial dose 20 mg/m2/week orally is continued until the end of therapy (25 months, 108 weeks) and is titrated together with 6 -mercaptopurine. During the week when intrathecal therapy is given the oral dose is omitted or adjusted to an appropriate total dose depending on the size of the patient . Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", given once at the start of Maintenance (week 32, day 218 ) and 12 -weekly for an additional two doses (week 44 and week 56) . Dexamethasone (Dexa) If the patient takes part in Randomisation 2 (R2) this is an IMP Dexamethasone 6 mg/m2/day, given oral ly, divided in 2 -3 doses for 5 days on days 218 -222 and after that 4 weekly. Vincristine (VCR) If the patient takes part in Randomisation 2 (R2) this is an IMP Vincristine given at 1.5 mg/m2/dose, (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or short infusion of 15 min on day 218 and after that 4 weekly. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 13.10.7.3 General considerations and supportive care For detailed instructions on the steering of Maintenance -therapy refer to protocol Maintenance guidelines . Patients included in R2 have extended reporting of toxicity for secondary end - points to the randomisation (see sec tion 7.3.2). Anaemia occurring in the course of maintenance therapy should be treated with transfusion and the dose of drug maintained. If persistent (> 4 weeks) anaemia occurs, investigate for Parvovirus or other infection. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 170 IR-Low Risk: Maintenance - Experimental Arm without VCR -Dexa pulses Eligible patients: This part of the protocol applies to IR -low patients - randomised to the experimental arm B in randomisation 2 (R2) with Doxorubicin and without VCR -Dexa pulses. The Maintenance phase runs in 12 -week cyc les from the beginning of week 32 for 36 weeks (until the end of week 68) and continuously after that until treatment is stopped exactly 2 years from the start of consolidation 1 . Once maintenance is started the clock does not stop regardless of whether tr eatment is given or not. Only Mercaptopurine and oral Methotrexate will be interrupted for myelosuppression and the time is not be made up. Days off therapy for intercurrent infections are counted as days of maintenance and thus no compensation is made f or interruptions in treatment. 13.10.8.1 Starting criteria Maintenance is started when - ANC is 0.75x109/L and - platelets 75x109/L. 13.10.8.2 Antileukaemic initial dose 75 mg/m2/day orally , once daily, up to 2 years from complete remission (25 months, 108 weeks). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT - deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. Maintenance doses will be adjusted to keep the ANC level between 0.75 -1.5 x109/L. Methotrexate (MTX) Methotrexate, initial dose 20 mg/m2/week orally is continued until the end of therapy (25 months, 108 weeks) and is titrated together with 6 -mercaptopurine. During the week when intrathecal therapy is given the oral dose is omitted or adjusted to an appropriate total dose depending on the size of the patient . Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", given once at the start of Maintenance (week 32, day 218 ) and 12 -weekly for an additional two doses (week 44 and week 56) . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 171 13.10.8.3 General considerations and supportive care For detailed instructions on the steering of Maintenance -therapy refer to Appendix 6. Patients included in R2 have extended reporting of toxicity for secondary end - points to the randomisation (see sec tion 7.3.2). Anaemia occurring in the course of maintenance therapy should be treated with transfusion and the dose of drug maintained. If persistent (> 4 weeks) anaemia occurs, investigate for Parvovirus or other infection. 6MP and MTX should be given at a regular schedule, but there are no restrictions as to the circadian schedule or to dosing in relation to intake of food (including milk products). Prophylaxis against Pneumomocystis Jirovecii pneumonia: Due to methotrexate metabolism interaction the days of Co -trimoxazole prophylaxis and methotrexate therapy should be separated.

In many countries, the preparations of steroids have no indication for intrathecal use and alternative preparations for other indications exist. It is therefore of utmost importance that only preparations without preservatives and without Benzyl alcohol are used. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 174 IR-High Risk: Consolidation 1 BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 29 (TP1). Since the stratification may chang e after MRD -evaluation at TP2, this stratification is provisional. patients have MRD values <5% at TP1, but above the cut -off for their genetic group: - ETV6 -RUNX1 - MRD cut -offs above, IR -high also applies to - \"B-other\" genotype and \"Poor -Risk\" CNAs - with CNS3 TLP(+) and 5 leukocytes/microL CSF - with HR-genetics - with failed genetic work -up - with failed MRD -work -up - 16 years otherwise fulfilling criteria for IR -low. T-cell patients with to IR -therapy and stratified further at TP2. Consolidation 1 runs for 6 weeks from day 29 (beginning of week 5) to day 70 inclusive (end of week 10). 13.11.2.1 Starting -criteria VCR and ITT -therapy on day 29 (for VCR alternatively day 30) are administered without considering peripheral blood counts - only the general condition of the patient. The platelet count should be adequate (refer to local/national guidelines) at the time of lumbar puncture, but platelets may be transfused to achieve this. Even in the case of complications during induction therapy, BM assessment day 29 is very i mportant, since it is the basis for the stratification and should be performed on the day of the administration of day 29 chemo. The PEG -Asp on day 32 and 46 are administered regardless of when 6MP and the subsequent ARA -C doses are started. Before each a dministration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and no signs of pancreatitis, severe hepatic toxicity or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 175 thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been instituted and the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy - see guidelines on thrombosis and antithrombotic prophylaxis (optional ) or national/local guidelines . The patient should be in acceptable clinical condition with infectious complications under control before continued therapy day 36. In addition, 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP), Cyclophosphamide (CPM) and intrathecal therapy day 36 is started when: - WBC is 1.5x109/L or - ANC is 0.5 x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L and rising. The starting criteria for the second cyclophosphamide (and the rest of the block) are - WBC 1.0x109/L or - ANC 0.3 x109/L and - platelets Consolidation 1 Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone tapering during 7 -10 days from day 29. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on day 29. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2 day given oral ly days 36 -63 (in total 28 days). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should 5 mg/m2. Cyclophosphamide (CPM) Cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 over 30 -60 min will be given on days 36 and 50. Hydration before and after cyclophosphamide according to national guidelines. Mesna before and after cyclophosphamide is optional and should be given according to national guidelines. Cytarabine (ARA -C) Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose IV injection, given on days 38 - 41, 45 -48, 52 -55 and 59 -62. Pegylated (or IM) (PEG -Asp) 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) on days 32, 46 and 60. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20 000 IU/m2/dose every second day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp. Asparaginase activity monitoring (see TDM ASP guidelines ) is used to detect inactivation/distinguish between reactions with and without inactivation. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", on days 29, 36 and 50. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 176 13.11.2.3 General considerations and supportive care Once started, the Cytarabine blocks should be given without interruptions. If Cytarabine has to be postponed or interrupted for clinical reasons, 6 -mercaptopurine should also be interrupted. Omitted 6 -mercaptopurine dos es should be made up until the planned cumulative total dose of 1680 mg/m2 (28 x 60 mg/m2) is reached. If no contra -indication for the administration of PEG -Asp exists, PEG -Asp should be administered even if the 6 -MP and ARA -C have been interrupted. Conversely, 6 -MP and ARA -C should be administered if there are no contra -indications to these drugs, even if PEG -Asp is not administered due to Asp -specific contra -indications. Intrathecal therapy during Consolidation 1 Patients with CNS1 and TLP without leukaemic cells (TLP -) at diagnosis and patients with CNS2/TLP+ and low cell count at diagnosis, who have responded well to initial single Mtx continue with single Mtx. Patients with CNS2/TLP+ and slow response and pati ents with CNS3/TLP+ with 5 cells/microL CSF at diagnosis continue with ITT throughout therapy. Patients with remaining leukaemic cells in the CSF day 29 continue with weekly ITTs until CSF is clear in 2 consecutive samples (CNS -remission) - possible extra doses days 43, 57 and 64. Patients with remaining leukaemic contamination of the CSF at the end of Consolidation 1 have Protocol Therapy Failure (primary event in the EFS analysis). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 177 IR-High Risk: Consolidation 2 BM examinati on for stratification will be performed on day 71 (TP2) . Eligible patients: Most BCP -patients who are -high stratification have identified at TP1 . Patients the IR -high criteria at TP1 MRD at TP2 are stratified to IR -high. A small fraction of T -cell patients <16 years at diagnosis with MRD 5% at TP, but with good response to Consolidation 1 and undete ctable MRD at TP2 return to the IR -high group from the start of Consolidation 2. Patients, who have MRD -values 0.05% or with persistent testicular disease or mediastinal mass (see definition under point 6.2.5 and 6.2.6 ) are re -stratified after -therapy (persistent testicular/mediastinal disease) with allo -SCT. Consolidation 2 runs for 7 weeks from day 71 (beginning of week 11) to day 119 inclusive (end of week17). 13.11.3.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in go od clinical condition and free of serious infection. Before the start of 6MP: - WBC should be 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L and rising. Each dose of HD-MTX can be given, when: - ANC is 0.5x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L and rising and - renal function should be normal and - aminotransferases should not exceed >10 x the ULN and - Patients should be free of significant infection, diarrhoea, mucositis and effusions (second compartments). Prior to starting the second course of HDMTX , at least serum creatinine should be measured. If it has not returned to normal, GFR should be assessed and should be >70mL/minute/1.73m2. This is particularly important if kidney function was impaired during th e previous course or the Mtx -excretion was prolonged. However, prolonged Mtx-excretion during previous courses is not in itself a contra -indication for continued HDMTX -therapy. The PEG -Asp on day 74, 88 and 102 are administered regardless of when 6MP and the subsequent HD -MTX doses start if the clinical condition allows it. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 178 Before each administration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and no signs of pancreatitis, severe hepatic toxicity or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been instituted and the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy. Conversely, 6 -MP and HD -MTX should be administered if there are no contra - indications, even if PEG -Asp is not administered due to Asp -specific contra - indications. If the platelet count falls below 30x109/L or the ANC falls below 0.2x109/L after the HD-MTX -courses, the 6 -MP shou ld be temporarily discontinued and re-started when both counts rise above these limits again. 6 -MP should always be started at the latest when the second HD -MTX course is starting, but then the starting -criteria have to be fulfilled. 13.11.3.2 mg/m2/day given orally days 71 -119 (weeks 11 -17). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should mg/m2. Pegylated Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) Pegylated asparaginase IV (or IM) over one hour (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2), on days 74, 88 and 102. Patients 25 years at diagnosis have one additional dose day 116. TDM is used to detect inactivation/distinguish between reactio ns with and without inactivation . In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20 000 IU/m2/dose every second day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp. Asparaginase activity monitoring (see TDM ASP guidelines ) is used to detect inactivation/distinguish between reactions with and without inactivation. HD-Methotrexate (HD-MTX) Methotrexate 5000 mg/m2 is given as a 24 -hour continuous infusion on days 78 and 99. 10% of the dose is administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% in the following 23 hours. All patients must be prehydrated as per HD-MTX guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines . Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Folinic acid 15mg/m2 of the racemic preparation or 7.5mg/m2 of the L - isomeric product intravenously at 42, 48 and 54 hours after the start of each Methotrexate infusion. The dose of Folinic acid and the hydration should be adjusted according to the Mtx-concentration and kidney function and Folinic acid rescue should be continued 6 -hourly until the Mtx - concentration is <0.2 micromol/L. Do not cap the dose. Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Extreme Mtx -concentration and severely impair ed kidney function may indicate the use of Carboxy -peptidase. Refer to Carboxypeptidase guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS - status at diagnosis and early respon se, dosing by age ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 179 according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on days 78 and 99. 13.11.3.3 General considerations and supportive care Drug interactions Drugs which compromise renal function, e.g. aminoglycosides and non -steroid anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAID), can decrease clearance of methotrexate and lead to systemic toxicity and should therefore be avoided during this phase. Methotrexate clearance is also hampered by proton -pump inhibitors, which should also be avoided. The administration of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) carries significant potential toxicity which in extreme cases can be fatal. This is prevented by effective folinic acid rescue. Absolute compliance with the schedule of hydration, monitoring of levels and folinic acid rescue is mandatory in this phase of the protocol. It is vital to rea d this section of the protocol before commencing administration of HDMTX . Please als o ensure that you have made certain that your patient has no contraindication to HDMTX. Please note that to be eligible for entry into this phase renal function should be within normal limits corrected for age. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 180 IR-High Risk: Extended Delayed Intensification Eligible patients: IR-high stratification. This phase runs for 12 weeks from day 120 (beginning of week 18) to day 203 inclusive (end week 29) in cycles of 3 weeks each. 13.11.4.1 Starting criteria to start a new cycle (beginning of week 18, 21, 24 and 27) The patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection and have at most mild mucositis. The first cycle should meet the criteria for starting without adaptation: - ANC should be 1.0 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising and - ASAT/ALAT < 10 x normal upper limit value and - conjugated bilirubin < 3x upper normal level If neutrophil and platelet criteria are not met for the following cycles , the course should be adapted as follows: 1. If ANC is between 0.5 and 1.0 x 109/L, reduce the dose of 6 -MP to 50% or delete the first week of 6 -MP. 2. If ANC is < 0.5 x 109/L or platelets < 50 x 109/L, delete the first week of 6 -MP and postpone the dose of DOX for one week. 3. If after one week ANC is still < 0.5 x 109/L or platelets still < 50 x 109/L, then delete also the second week of 6 -MP and postpone DOX to week 3 0 (after the 4th cycle ). 4. If DOX has to be postponed again at the next 3 -week cycle, then the dose of DOX can be reduced to 50%. In general, if serious dose reductions are necessary, omitting 6 -MP in this phase should be preferred above dose reductions or postponement of DOX. If criteria of lack of mucositis and/or liver function are not met, chemotherapy should be held for 3 to 7 days, then recheck clinical condition a nd/or liver function tests. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 181 13.11.4.2 Antileukaemic Delayed Intensification Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2/day, divided in 2 -3 doses given orally days 120 -124 (w18), 141 -145 (w21), Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine given at 1.5 mg/m2/dose IV push or short infusion of 15 min (maximum dose 2 mg) on day 120, 141, 162 and 183 (the first day of each DI block). It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. Doxorubicin (DOX) Doxorubicin 30 mg/m2/dose IV, one hour infusion on day 120, 141, 162 and 183 (the first day of each DI block). Dose -reduction to 15mg m2/dose if indicated in the instruction above. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-MP 50 mg/m2/day given orally the first 14 days of each DI block . In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT - deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. Omitted for the times indicated in the instruction above if necessary. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS -status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on day 120, 141, 162 and 183 (the first day of each DI block) . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 182 IR-High Risk: Consolidation 3 Eligible patients: IR-high stratification. This phase runs for 7 weeks from day 204 (beginning of week 30) to day 252 inclusive (end of week 36). However, if a dose of Doxorubicin was postponed from Delayed Intensification to week 30, the protocol re -starts again with Consolidation 3 when counts recover. 13.11.5.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection. Before the start of 6MP: - WBC should be 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L and rising Each dose of HD-MTX can be given, when: - ANC is 0.5x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L and rising and - Renal function should be normal and - aminotransferases should not exce ed >10 x the ULN and - Patients should be free of significant infection, diarrhoea, mucositis and effusions (second compartments). Prior to starting the second course of HDMTX , at least serum creatinine should be measured. If it has not returned to n ormal, GFR should be assessed and should be >70mL/minute/1.73m2. This is particularly important if kidney function was impaired during the previous course or the Mtx -excretion was prolonged. However, prolonged Mtx-excretion during previous courses is not i n itself a contra -indica tion for continued HDMTX -therapy. If the platelet count falls below 30x109/L or the ANC falls below 0.2x109/L after the HD-MTX -courses, the 6 -MP should be temporarily discontinued and re-started when both counts rise above these limits again. 6 -MP should always be started at the latest when the second HD -MTX course is starting, but then the starting -criteria have to be fulfilled. 13.11.5.2 Antileukaemic mg/m2/day given orally days 204 -245 -35). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 183 HD-Methotrexate (HD-MTX) Methotrexate 5000 mg/m2 is given as a 24 -hour continuous infusion on days 211 and 232. 10% of the do se is administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% in the following 23 hours. All patients must be prehydrated as per HD-MTX guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines . Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Folinic acid 15mg/m2 of the racemic preparation or 7.5mg/m2 of the L - isomeric product intravenously at 42, 48 and 54 hours after the start of each Methotrexate infusion. The dose of Folinic acid and the hydration should be adjusted according to the Mtx - concentrati on and kidney function and Folinic acid rescue should be continued 6 -hourly until the Mtx -concentration is <0.2 micromol/L. Do not cap the dose. Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Extreme Mtx -concentration and severely impaired kidney function may indicate the use of Carboxy -peptidase. Refer to Carboxypeptidase guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS - status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on days 211 and 232. 13.11.5.3 General considerations and supportive care Drug interactions Drugs which compromise renal function, e.g. aminoglycosides and non -steroid anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAID), can dec rease clearance of methotrexate and lead to systemic toxicity and should therefore be avoided during this phase. Methotrexate clearance is also hampered by proton -pump inhibitors, which should also be avoided. 13.11.5.4 Randomisation 3 -InO Patients may be screened and if considered eligible, randomised in R3 - InO from week 35 (day 239, one weeks after 2nd HD-MTX in consolidation 3) until the start of the randomised therapy in week 37 (day 253) . The administration of high dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) carries significant potential toxicity which in extreme cases can be fatal. This is prevented by effective folinic acid rescue. Absolute compliance with the schedule of hydration, monitoring of levels and folinic acid rescue is mandatory in this phase of the protocol. It is vital to rea d this section of the protocol before commencing administration of HD-. Please als o ensure that you have made certain that your patient has no contraindication to HD-MTX. Please note that to be eligible for entry in to this phase renal function should be within normal limits corrected for age. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 184 IR-High Risk: Sta ndard Maintenance with VCR -Dexa pulses Eligible patients: This part of the protocol applies to - patients randomised to the standard arm in any of the randomisations 3 (R3 - InO). - patients not taking part the R3 - InO randomisation for any reason. This version of the Maintenance phase runs in 4 -week cycles beginning week 37. Treatment is stopped exactly 2 years from the start of consolidation 1. Once maintenance is started the clock does not stop regardless of whether treatment is given or not. Only Mercaptopurine and oral Methotrexate will be interrupted for myelosuppression and the time is not be made up. Days off therapy for intercurrent infections are counted as days of maintenance and thus no compensation is made for interruptions in treatment. 13.11.6.1 Starting criteria Maintenance is started when - ANC is 0.75x109/L and - platelets is 75x109/L. 13.11.6.2 6-mercaptopurine, initial dose 75 mg/m2/day orally up to 2 years from complete remission (25 months, 108 weeks). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. Maintenance doses will be adjusted to keep the ANC level between 0.75 - 1.5 x109/L. Metho trexate (MTX) Methotrexate, initial dose 20 mg/m2/week orally is continued until the end of therapy (25 months, 108 weeks) and is titrated together with 6 -mercaptopurine. During the week when intrathecal therapy is given the oral dose is omitted or adjust ed to an appropriate total dose depending on the size of the patient . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 185 Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS -status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" , given once at the start of Maintenance (week 37, day 253) and 12 -weekly throughout Maintenance . Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone 6 mg/m2/day, given oral ly, divided in 2 -3 doses for 5 days on days 253 -257 and after that 4 weekly. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine given at 1.5 mg/m2/dose, (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or short infusion of 15 min on day 2 53 and after that 4 weekly. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 13.11.6.3 General considerations and supportive care For detailed instructions on the steering of Maintenance -therapy refer to protocol Maintenance guidelines NB! If the patient has taken part in R3 - InO (regardless of which randomisation) and has been randomised to the standard arm, special rules apply regarding toxicity -reporting during Standard Maintenance. Anaemia occurring in the course of maintenance therapy should be treated with transfusion and the dose of drug maintained. If persistent (> 4 weeks) anaemia occurs (i.e., haemoglobin below 8 g/dl) investigate for Parvovirus or other infection. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 186 IR-High Ris k Experimental Arm: Inotuzumab phase before Standard Maintenance NOTE: this paragraph only contains very limited information about the InO trial, and should not be used as the treatment and study guideline. The InO -trial protocol need s to be followed strictly. Eligible patients: This part of the protocol applies to - Patients randomised to receive Inotuzumab The experimental block runs from the beginning of week 37 to the end of week 42 (6 weeks in total). 13.11.7.1 Starting criteria The randomised Inotuzumab -phase is started when - the ANC 0.75x109/L and - platelets are 75x109/L and - serum creatinine is 2 x the ULN and - ALT is 3 x the ULN and - total bilirubin is 1.5 x the ULN and The patient should not have an active systemic infection or evidence of hepatic SOS/VOD. The shortening fraction should be 30% or the ejection fraction should be 50% by echocardiography/multigated aquisition scan (MUGA). One cycle consists of 3 dose s. Dose 2 and 3 in each cycle will be given irrespective of blood counts, but may be postponed due to non -haematological toxicity (for details, see separate R3 InO sub -protocol). For the second cycle (day 274 or 281 ) the same criteria for start of cycle 1 apply (without assessment of the cardiac function) except: - the ANC should be 0.5x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L Maximum delay of the beginning of the second InO cycle due to InO -related toxicities is 3 weeks after the 3rd dose in cycle 1. In addition, all grade 3/4 non -haematological toxicities must have resolved to grade 2 or baseline (except allopecia) prior to each dose of InO. 13.11.7.2 Antileukaemic therapy IR -High Inotuzumab phase an IMP Inotuzumab ozagamicin 0.5 mg/m2 is given on days 253, 260, 267 (cycle 1) and on days 274, 281, 288 (cycle 2) as a one hour IV infusion. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 187 13.11.7.3 General considerations a nd supportive care Anti-emetics as per institutional guidelines 15 min prior to infusion start. Methylprednisolone 1mg/kg IV (max 50mg) 10 min prior to InO infusion. NB! Special rules apply for toxicity -reporting during and after the InO -phase. For details regarding vigilance and reporting, please, refer to detailed separate InO- protocol a nd the section on toxicity -reporting . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 188 IR-High Risk: Experimental Arm Inotuzumab - Standard Maintenance Post InO Eligible patients: This part of the protocol applies to - Patients who have received the experimental Inotuzumab block and should continue Standard Maintenance. The Maintenance phase after the Inotuzumab block runs in 4 -week cycles beginning week 43. Treatment is stopped 2 years+6 weeks from the start of consolidation 1. Once maintenance is started the clock does not stop regardless of whether treatment is given or not. Only Mercaptopurine and oral Methotrexate will be interrupted for myelosuppression and the time is not be made up. Days off therapy for intercurrent infections are counted as days of maintenance and thus no compensation is made for interruptions in treatment. 13.11.8.1 Starting criteria Maintenance is started after the second cycle of InO upon blood count recovery when - ANC 0.75x109/L and - platelets 75x109/L and In addition, the ALT should be 5 x the ULN and total bilirubin should be 3 x the ULN. The earliest time -point is day 295 (week 43), but is likely to be considerably later due to ha ematological toxicity of InO. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 189 13.11.8.2 Antileukaemic therapy IR -High Risk Standard Maintenance Post InO 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP) This is an IMP 6-mercaptopurine, initial dose 75 mg/m2/day orally up to 2 years + 6 weeks from start of Consolidation 1 (25 months, 114 weeks). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. Maintenance doses will be adjusted to keep the ANC level between 0.75 -1.5 x109/L. Methotrexate (MTX) This is an IMP Methotrexate, initial dose 20 mg/m2/week orally is continued until the end of therapy (25 months, 108 weeks) and is titrated together with 6 -mercapto purine. During the week when intrathecal therapy is given the oral dose is omitted or adjusted to an appropriate total dose depending on the size of the patient . Intrathecal therapy This is an IMP Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS -status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" , given once at the start of Maintenance (week 43, day 295) and 12-weekly throughout Maintenance . Dexamethasone (Dexa) This is an IMP Dexamethasone 6 mg/m2/day, given orally, divided in 2 -3 doses for 5 days on days 2 95-299 and 4 weekly thereafter. Vincristine (VCR) This is an IMP Vincristine given at 1.5 mg/m2/dose, (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or short infusion of 15 min on day 295 and 4 weekly thereafter . It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 13.11.8.3 General considerations and supportive care For detailed instructions on the steering of Maintenance -therapy refer to the protocol Maintenance guidelines . NB! The toxicity -reporting from the InO trial carries on into the Standard Maintenance phase to catch follow -on toxicity of InO . This also applies to the patients randomized to standard maintenance! For details regarding vigilance and reporting regarding toxicities, please, refer to the detailed separate InO-protocol an d toxicity -reporting guidelines . Anaemia occurring in the course of maintenance therapy should be treated with transfusion and the dose of drug maintained. If persistent (> 4 weeks) anaemia occurs (i.e., haemoglobin below 8 g/dl) investigate for Parvovirus or other infection. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 190 13.12 Post -inducti on t herapy for patients with Dosing of Methotrexate and intrathecal triple therapy (ITT) by age: Age 1 -<2 2-<3 3 Single Mtx dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Triple Intrathecal (ITT) dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Cytarabine 20 mg 25 mg 30 mg Alternative steroids in ITT Hydrocortisone Succinate* or 16 mg 20 mg 24 mg Prednisolone Sodium Succinate or 4 mg 5 mg 6 mg Methyl -Prednisolone Sodium Succinate 3.2 mg 4 mg 4.8 mg *Both the Hemisuccinate - and the Sodium succinate salt of Hydrocortisone can be used. In many countries, the preparations of steroids have no indication for intrathecal use and alternative preparations for other indications exist. It is therefore of utmo st importance that only preparations without preservatives and without Benzyl alcohol are used. Guidelines for dose -adaptation of Imatinib ( IMA) due to toxicity: Hematologic: A. During Chemotherapy (all patients prior to HSCT): Do not hold or reduce dose for low blood counts, unless prolonged (resulting in a >14 day delay in next block of chemotherapy). Prior to Maintenance : If neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia results in delay of next block of chemotherapy by > 14 days: Hold Imatinib and resume at the same dose once ANC/platelet counts recover sufficiently to begin the next block of treatment. If subsequent blocks of treatment are delayed for >14 days due to neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, Imatinib should be held, and dose may be reduced when resta rted after ANC/platelet count recovery (e.g., 20% dose reduction of Imatinib). During Maintenance: If ANC falls below 0.5 x109/L or if platelet count falls below ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 191 50 x109/L: continue imatinib but hold 6MP and methotrexate, as indicated below. If after 2 we eks of holding methotrexate/6MP, ANC remains below 0.5 x109/L or platelet count below 50 x109/L, Imatinib should be held. Imatinib should be restarted without dose reduction once counts recover (ANC >0.5 x109/L, platelets > 50 x109/L. For recurrent neutrop enia/thrombocytopenia: First reduce doses of 6MP/methotrexate, as indicated below. Imatinib dose may be reduced by 20% if low blood counts recur in patients already receiving dose -reduced 6MP/methotrexate. Hepatic: A. Direct Bilirubin elevation: Hold bilirubin is > 3 x ULN . Restart when direct bilirubin is Grade 1 or lower (< 1.5 x ULN). Resume at full dose. Reduce dose by 20% if elevation of direct bilirubin recurs. B. Elevated tran Hold Imatinib if transaminases >10x ULN. Restart at full dose when < 5 x ULN (Grade 2 or less). If liver dysfunction recurs, reduce dose of Imatinib by 20% only after dose reducing other chemotherapy (eg, MTX/6MP during maintenance) and withholding other potentially causative agents. Infection: Hold Imatinib if Grade 4 infection until clinically improved (Grade 3 or lower), and then restart without dose reduction. Do not hold for uncomplicated less severe infections (Grade 3 or lower). Infection: Hold imatinib for Grade 4 infection until clinically improved (Grade 3 or lower), and then restart without dose reduction. Do not hold for uncomplicated less severe infections (Grade 3 or lower). Cardiac Toxi city: If Grade 1 QTc elevation: hold other agents associated with prolonged QTc. If no improvement, then Imatinib should be held until resolution, and then restarted. For Grade 2 or higher QTc interval, hold Imatinib. Imatinib may be resumed once QTc prolongation resolves (< Grade 1). Imatinib dose may be reduced by 20% if QTc prolongation recurs. Edema/Effusions: If the patient experiences Grade 3 or higher pericardial, pleural effusions, or edema/e ffusion resolves if thought to be unrelated or unlikely to be related to Imatinib. If the effusion is felt to be caused by Imatinib, then consider restarting IImatinib at 80% dose when resolved. Close follow - up is warranted after restarting Imatinib in the latter situation. Other Grade 3 or higher Non -Hematologic Toxicity: Holding Imatinib or reducing dose is discouraged. However, if patient experiences Grade 3 or higher non -hematologic toxicity that is thought to be likely or definitely related to Imatin ib that does not resolve despite symptomatic treatment, Imatinib may be held after discussion with national coordinator or international chair. In such instances, Imatinib should be restarted once toxicity has resolved to Grade 2 or lower. If the patient d oes not tolerate Imatinib switch to Dasatinib (dose 60 mg/m2). Such cases should be discussed with the national coordinator or the international study chair. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 192 Consolidation 1 for patients with ABL -class fusions BM examination will be performed on (TP1) . However, patients with ABL -class fusions are not stratified at this time -point. They continue with standard Consolidation 1 + IMA awaiting stratification at day 71 (TP2). Eligible patients: This means that patients with any MRD -response at da y 29 will be eligible. This phase runs for 6 weeks from day 29 (beginning of week 5) to day 70 inclusive (end of week 10). 13.12.2.1 Starting -criteria VCR and ITT -therapy on day 29 (for VCR alternatively day 30) are administered without considering peripheral blood counts - only the general condition of the patient. The platelet count should be adequate (refer to local/national guidelines) at the time of lumbar puncture, but platelets may be transfused to achieve this. The PEG -Asp on day 32, 46 and 60 are administered regardless of when 6MP and the subsequent ARA -C doses start if the clinical condition allows it. Before each administration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and no signs of pancreatitis, se vere hepatic toxicity or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been instituted and the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy. Patients with a high remaining leukaemic cell load after induction ( 5%) must continue therapy as soon as possible. When a high MRD -value at day 29 has been confirmed 6 -Mercaptopurine (6MP), Cyclophosphamide (CPM) and ITT on day 36 is started, regardless of peripheral blood co unts, when the general condition allows it. Once Consolidation 1 is started and the patient had an MRD of 5% at day 29, it should be completed irrespective of blood counts. There are no starting -criteria for the Cytarabine -blocks and the second Cyclophosp hamide in this situation. Only serious clinical conditions, such as uncontrolled infection may interrupt therapy and such interruptions are based on individual clinical assessments. Heart function should be adequate and the corrected QT -interval must be < 480ms for ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 193 Imatinib to start. If this was the case in the screening cardiac assessment, no new assessment is necessary. Se protocol g uidelines for dose -adaption of Imatinib due to toxicity. Patients who have MRD of <5% at day 29 should otherwise be in acce ptable clinical condition with infectious complications under control before continued therapy day 36. In addition, 6 -Mercaptopurine (6MP), Cyclophosphamide (CPM) and ITT on day 36 is started if: - WBC is 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising. For patients starting Consolidation 1 with an MRD day 29 of <5%, the starting criteria for the second cyclophosphamide day 50 (and the rest of the block) are - WBC 1.0x109/L or - ANC 0.3 x109/L and - platelets 50x1 09/L and rising . 13.12.2.2 Consolidation 1 ABL-class fusions with IMA Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone tapering during 7 -10 days from day 29. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on day 29. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2 day given orall y days 36 -63 (in total 28 days). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should 5 mg/m2. Cyclophosphamide (CPM) Cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 over 30 -60 min will be given on days 36 and 50. Hydration before and after cyclophosphamide according to national guidelines. Mesna before and after cyclophosphamide is optional and should be given according to national guidelines. Cytarabine (ARA -C) Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose IV push, given on asparaginase 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on days 32, 46 and 60. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20 000 IU/m2/dose every second day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp. Asparaginase activity monitoring ( TDM ASP guidelines ) is used to detect inactivation/distinguish between reactions with and without inactivation. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on days 29, 36 and 50 Imatinib (IMA) This is an IMP Patients 25 years at diagnosis start Imatinib from day 29. Imatinib 340 mg/m2/day (max 600mg -patients 25 years or 800 - <25 years mg/m2/day) orally is given continuously throughout the phase (day 29 -70) for all age groups. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 194 13.12.2.3 General considerations, response evaluation and supportive care Once started, the cytarabine blocks should be given without interruptions. If cytarabine has to be postponed or interrupted for clinical reasons, 6 -mercaptopurine should also be interrupted. Omitted 6 -mercaptopurine doses should be made up until the planned cumulative total dose of 1680 mg/m2 (28 x 60 mg/m2) is reached. If no contra -indication for the administration of PEG -Asp exists, PEG -Asp should be administered even if the 6 -MP and ARA -C have been interrupted. Conversely, 6 -MP ARA-C should be administered if there are no contra -indications to these drugs, even if PEG -Asp is not administered due to Asp -specific contra -indications. Evaluation of the response to Consolidation 1 is scheduled for day 71. This bone - marrow is important for stratification and will be performed irrespective of peripheral blood counts if the patient started Consolidation 1 with high MRD (5%). Patients in remission day 29 await count recovery before the day 71 evaluation. In case of a clinical suspicion of lack of response during Consolidation 1, or if Consolidation 1 therapy has to be temporarily interrupted for clinical reasons, usually because of infectious complications, a bone marrow assessment should be performed on day 50. This check is mandatory for patients 16 years with 20% disease on day 29 . In such cases, the therapy day 50 may be postponed one day to receive the FCM - results. If the response to Consolidation 1 therapy in such an early assessment is considere d inadequate (increased or unchanged leukaemic cell load), the therapy may be switched to the first HR -block (block A) instead of continuing Consolidation 1. Such cases should be discussed with the national coordinator or the international study chair. Intrathecal therapy during Consolidation 1 Patients with CNS1 and TLP without leukaemic cells (TLP -) at diagnosis and patients with CNS2/TLP+ and low cell count at diagnosis, who have responded well to initial single Mtx continue with single Mtx. Patients with CNS2/TLP+ and slow response and patients with CNS3/TLP+ with 5 cells/microL CSF at diagnosis continue with ITT throughout therapy. Patients with remaining leukaemic cells in the CSF day 29 continue with weekly ITTs until CSF is clear in 2 consecut ive samples (CNS -remission) - possible extra doses days 43, 57 and 64. Patients with remaining leukaemic contamination of the CSF at the end of Consolidation 1 have Protocol Therapy Failure (primary event in the EFS analysis). 13.12.2.4 Regarding dose modifications of IMA due to toxicity See above or separate protocol g uidelines for dose -adaptation of Ima tinib (IMA) due to toxicity . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 195 Post Consolidation 1 stratification and therapy for patients with ABL -class fusions: Consolidation 2 with Imatinib A BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 71 (TP2): This bone -marrow is important and will be performed irrespective of peripheral blood counts if the patient started Consolidation 1 with high MRD ( 5%). If the patient started Consolidatio n 1 with MRD <5% at day 29 and awaited recovery of normal haematopoiesis before starting treatment day 36 (having achieved complete remission by protocol), this bone -marrow will be performed when the starting -criteria for starting 6MP listed below are fulf illed. Eligible patients: ABL-class fusion patients continuing on the IR -High arm have to have MRD - values <0.05%. Such patients will be treated with continuous IMA throughout therapy. Patients, who have MRD -values 0.05% are re -stratified after TP2 to HR-therapy with allo -HSCT and will switch to further therapy according to the HR -therapy arm. For these patients, the effect of IMA is considered insufficient and IMA is stopped at this time -point. This phase runs for 7 weeks from day 71 (beginning of wee k 11) to day 119 inclusive (end of week17). 13.12.3.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection. Before the start of 6MP: - WBC should be 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5x109/L - platelets 50x109/L and rising . Each dose of HD-MTX can be given, when: - ANC is 0.5x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L and rising. - Renal function should be normal and - aminotransferases should not exceed >10 x the ULN - Patients should be free of significant infection, dia rrhoea, mucositis and effusions (second compartments). Prior to starting the second course of HDMTX, at least serum creatinine should be measured. If it has not returned to normal, GFR should be assessed and should be >70mL/minute/1.73m2. This is particul arly important if kidney function was impaired ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 196 during the previous course or the Mtx -excretion was prolonged. However, prolonged Mtx-excretion during previous courses is not in itself a contra -indication for continued HDMTX -therapy. The PEG -Asp on day 74, 88 and 102 are administered regardless of when 6MP and the subsequent HD -MTX doses start if the clinical condition allows it. Before each administration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and no signs of pancreatitis, severe hepatic toxicit y or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been instituted and the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy. Conversely, 6 -MP and HD -MTX should be adminis tered if there are no contra - indications, even if PEG -Asp is not administered due to Asp -specific contra - indications. If the platelet count falls below 30x109/L or the ANC falls below 0.2x109/L after the HD-MTX -courses, the 6 -MP should be temporarily discontinued and re -started when both counts rise above these limits again. 6 -MP should always be started at the latest when the second HD -MTX course is starting, but then the starting -criteria have to be fulfilled. 13.12.3.2 Antileukaemic therapy 25 mg/m2/day given orally days 71 -119 (weeks 11 - 17). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT - deficiency, the dose should be to 5 mg/m2. Pegylated Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) Pegylated asparaginase 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on days 74, 88 and 102. Patients 25 years at diagnosis have one additional dose day 116. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 2 0 000 IU/m2/dose every second day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp. Asparaginase activity monitoring (see appendix 5) is used to detect inactivation/distinguish between reactions with and without inactivation. HD-Methotrexate (HD-MTX) Methotrexate 5000 mg/m2 is given as a 24 -hour continu ous infusion on days 78 and 99. 10% of the dose is administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% in the following 23 hours. All patients must be prehydrated as per HD-MTX guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines . Timings of drug admin istration must be followed strictly. Folinic acid 15mg/m2 of the racemic preparation or 7.5mg/m2 of the L - isomeric product intravenously at 42, 48 and 54 hours after the start of each Methotrexate infusion. The dose of Folinic acid and the hydration shoul d be adjusted according to the Mtx-concentration and kidney function and Folinic acid rescue should be continued 6 -hourly until the Mtx - concentration is <0.2 micromol/L. Do not cap the dose. Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Extreme Mtx-concentration and severely impaired kidney function may indicate the use of Carboxy -peptidase. Refer ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 197 to Carboxypeptidase guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS -status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on days 78 and 99. Imatinib (IMA) This is an IMP Imatinib 340 mg/m2/day (max 600mg -patients 25 years or 800 - <25 years mg/m2/day) orally is given continuously throughout the phase (day 71 -119). 13.12.3.3 General considerations and supportive care Drug interactions Drugs which compromise renal function, e.g. aminoglycosides and non -steroid anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAID), can decrease clearance of methotrexate and lead to systemic toxicity and should therefore be avoided during this phase. Methotrexate clearance is also hampered by proton -pump inhibitors, which should also be avoided. 13.12.3.4 Regarding dose modifications of IMA due to toxicity See above , section 13.12.2.3 and protocol g uidelines for dose -adaptation of Imatinib (IMA) due to toxicity . The administration of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) carries significant potential toxicity which in extreme cases can be fatal. This is prevented by effective folinic acid rescue. Absolute compliance with the schedule of hydration, monitoring of levels an d folinic acid rescue is mandatory in this phase of the protocol. It is vital to read this section of the protocol before commencing administration of HDMTX. Please also ensure that you have made certain that your patient has no contraindication to HDMTX. Please note that to be eligible for entry into this phase renal function should be within normal limits corrected for age. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 198 IR-High Risk: Extended Delayed Intensification for patients with ABL -class fusions with adequate response Eligible patients: This phase applies to patients with ABL -class fusions continuing on IR -high therapy supplemented with IMA. The phase runs for 12 weeks from day 120 (beginning of week 18) to day 203 inclusive (end week 29) in cycles of 3 weeks each. 13.12.4.1 Starting criteria to start a new cycle (beginning of week 18, 21, 24 and 27) without adaption The patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection and have at most mild mucositis. To start a cycle without adapti on (the first cycle should start when the following criteria are fulfilled): - ANC should be 1.0 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising and - ASAT/ALAT < 10 x normal upper limit value and - conjugated bilirubin < 3x upper normal level If neutrophil and platelet criteria are not met, the course should be adapted as follows (applies to weeks 21, 24 and 27 - the therapy week 18 should be given with full doses) : 1. If granulocytes are between 0.5 and 1.0 x 109/L, reduce the dose of 6 -MP to 50% or delete the first week of 6 -MP. 2. If granulocytes are < 0.5 x 109/L or platelets < 50 x 109/L, delete the first week of 6 - MP and postpone the dose of DOX for one week. 3. If after one week granulocytes are still < 0.5 x 109/L or platelets still < 50 x 109/L, then delete also the second week of 6 -MP and postpone DOX to week 3 0 after the 4th cycle. 4. If DOX has to be postponed again at the next 3 -week cycle, then the dose of DOX can be reduced to 50%. In general, if serious dose reductions are necessa ry, ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 199 omitting 6 -MP in this phase should be preferred above dose reductions or postponement of DOX. If criteria of lack of mucositis and/or liver function are not met, chemotherapy should be held for 3 to 7 days, then recheck clinical condition and/or liver function tests. 13.12.4.2 Antileukaemic therapy IR -High Risk Extended Delayed Intensification with IMA Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2/day, divided in 2 -3 doses given orally days 120 (w18), 141 -145 (VCR) Vincristine given at 1.5 mg/m2/dose IV push or short infusion of 15 min (maximum dose 2 mg) on day 120, 141, 162 and 183 (the first day of each DI block). It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. Doxorubicin (DOX) Doxorubicin 30 mg/m2/dose IV, one hour infusion on day 120, 141, 162 and 183 (the first day of each DI block). Dose - reduction to 15mg m2/dose if indicated in the instruction above. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-MP 50 mg/m2/day given orally days 204 -245 (weeks 30 - 35). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT - deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. Omitted for the times indicated in the instruction above if necessary. Intrat hecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS - status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on days 120, 141, 162 and 183 (the first day of each DI b lock). Imatinib (IMA) This is an IMP Imatinib 340 mg/m2/day (max 600mg -patients 25 years or 800 - <25 years mg/m2/day) orally is given continuously throughout the phase (day 120 -140). 13.12.4.3 Dose modifications of IMA due to toxicity See above , section 13.12.2.3 and protocol g uidelines for dose -adaptation of Imatinib (IMA) due to toxicity. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 200 IR-High Risk: Consolidation 3 for patients with ABL -class fusions with adequate response Eligible patients: This phase applies to patients with ABL -class fusions continuing on IR -high therapy supplemented with IMA. Consolidation 3 runs for 7 weeks from day 204 (beginning of week 30) to day 252 inclusive (end of week 36). 13.12.5.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection. Before the start of 6MP: - WBC should be 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising Each dose of HD-MTX can be given, when: - ANC is 0.5x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L and rising. - Renal function should be normal and - aminotransferases should not exceed >10 x the ULN. - Patients should be free of significant infection, diarrhoea, mucositis and effusions (second compartments). Prior to starting the second course of HDMTX, at least serum creatinine should be measured. If it has not returned to normal, GFR should be assessed and should be >70mL/minute/1.73m2. This is particularly important if kidney function was impaired during the previous course or the Mtx -excretion was prolonged. However, prolonged Mtx-excretion during previous courses is not in itself a contra -indication for continued HDMTX -therapy. If the platelet count falls below 30x109/L or the ANC falls below 0.2x109/L aft er the HD-MTX -courses, the 6 -MP should be temporarily discontinued and re -started when both counts rise above these limits again. 6 -MP should always be started at the latest when the second HD -MTX course is starting, but then the starting -criteria have to be fulfilled. 13.12.5.2 Antileukaemic therapy IR -High Consolidation 3 with IMA (6-MP) 6-MP 25 mg/m2/day given orally days 204 -245 (weeks 30 - 35). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT - deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 201 HD-Methotrexate (HD-MTX) Methotrexate 5000 mg/m2 is given as a 24 -hour continuous infusion on days 176 and 197. 10% of the dose is administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% in the following 23 hours. All patients must be prehydrated as per HD-MTX guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines . Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Folinic acid 15mg/m2 of the racemic preparation or 7.5mg/m2 of the L - isomeric product intravenously at 42, 48 and 54 hours after the start of each Methotrexate infusion. The dose of Folinic acid and the hydration should be adjusted according to the Mtx-concentration and kidney function and Folinic acid rescue should be continued 6 -hourly until the Mtx - concentration is <0.2 micromol/L. Do not cap the dose. Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Extreme Mtx -concentration and severely impaired kidney function may indicate the use of Carboxy -peptidase. Refer to Carboxypeptidase guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS - status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on days 211 and 232. Imatinib (IMA) This is an IMP Imatinib 340 mg/m2/day (max 600mg -patients 25 years or 800 - <25 years mg/m2/day) orally is given continuously throughout the phase (day 204 -252). 13.12.5.3 General considerations and supportive care Drug interactions Drugs which compromise renal function, e.g. aminoglycosides and non-steroid anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAID), can decrease clearance of methotrexate and lead to systemic toxicity and should therefore be avoided during this phase. Methotrexate clearance is also hampered by proton -pump inhibitors, which should also be avo ided. 13.12.5.4 Dose modifications of IMA due to toxicity See above , section 13.12.2.3 and protocol g uidelines for dose -adaptation of Imatinib (IMA) due to toxicity. The administration of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) carries significant potential toxicity which in extreme cases can be fatal. This is prevented by effective folinic acid rescue. Absolute compliance with the schedule of hydration, monitoring of levels an d folinic acid rescue is mandatory in this phase of the protocol. It is vital to read this section of the protocol before commencing administration of HDMTX. Please also ensure that you have made certain that your patient has no contraindication to HDMTX. Please note that to be eligible for entry into this phase renal function should be within normal limits corrected for age. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 202 IR-High Risk: Standard Maintenance for patients with ABL -class fusions with adequate response Eligible patients: This phase applies to patients with ABL -class fusions continuing on IR -high therapy supplemented with IMA. Maintenance runs in 4 -week cycles from the beginning of week 37. Treatment is stopped exactly 2 years from the start of con solidation 1. Once maintenance is started the clock does not stop regardless of whether treatment is given or not. Only Mercaptopurine and oral Methotrexate will be interrupted for myelosuppression and the time is not be made up. Days off therapy for inter current infections are counted as days of maintenance and thus no compensation is made for interruptions in treatment. 13.12.6.1 Starting criteria Maintenance is started when - ANC 0.75x109/L and - platelets 75x109/L. 13.12.6.2 Antileukaemic therapy Standard 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP) 6-mercaptopurine, initial dose 75 mg/m2/day orally up to 2 years from complete remission (25 months, 108 weeks). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. Maintenance doses will be adjusted to keep the ANC level between 0.75 -1.5 x109/L. Methotrexate (MTX) Methotrexate, initial dose 20 mg/m2/week orally is continued until the end of therapy (25 months, 108 weeks) and is titrated together with 6 -mercaptopurine. During the week when intrathecal therapy is given the oral dose is omitted or adjusted to an appropriate total dose depending on the s ize of the patient . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 203 Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS - status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", given once at the start of Maintenance (week 37, day 253) and 12 -weekly throughout Maintenance. Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone 6 mg/m2/day, given orally, divided in 2 -3 doses for 5 days on days 218 -222 and after that 4 weekly. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine given at 1.5 mg/m2/dose, (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or short infusion of 15 min on day 218 and after that 4 weekly. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. Imatinib (IMA) This is an IMP Imatinib 340 mg/m2/day (max 600mg -patients 25 years or 800 - <25 years mg/m2/day) orally is given continuously to the conclusion of therapy week 106. 13.12.6.3 General considerations and supportive care For detailed instructions on the steering of Maintenance -therapy refer to the protocol Maintenance guidelines . 6MP and MTX should be given at a regular schedule, but there are no restrictions as to the circadian schedule or to dosing in relation to intake of food (including milk products ). Prophylaxis against Pneum ocystis e Jirovecii pneumonia: Due interaction the days of Co -trimoxazole prophylaxis and methotrexate therapy should be separated. 13.12.6.4 Dose modifications of IMA due to toxicity See above , section 13.12.2.3 and protocol g uidelines for dose -adaptation of Imatinib (IMA) due to toxicity.

BCP HR-chemotherapy outline Patients HR -treatment arm will receive 1-6 HR -blocks of chemotherapy depending on if they are eligible for SCT ( 1-3 blocks) or continued chemotherapy (6 blocks). Block A 1, block B 1, and block C 1 should always be the first three blocks . For patients with poor response to initial block therapy or with clinical problems after the blocks, the order of the subsequent block therapy may be individualised considering the previous MRD response, the subset of disease, and the pattern of toxicities. The preparatory regimen for CAR -T therapy is the Consolidation 2 phase from the IR-Low/High protocols. See CAR -T section as well as the separate CAR -T study protocols for d etails, when to perform apheresis etc. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 205 From Table 14: Dosing of intrathecal single Methotrexate and intrathecal triple therapy (ITT) by age: Age 1 -<2 2-<3 3 Single Mtx dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Triple Intrathecal (ITT) dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Cytarabine 20 mg 25 mg 30 mg Alternative steroids in ITT Hydrocortisone Succinate* or 16 mg 20 mg 24 mg Prednisolone Sodium Succinate or 4 mg 5 mg 6 mg Methyl -Prednisolone Sodium Succinate 3.2 mg 4 mg 4.8 mg *Both the Hemisuccinate - and the Sodium succinate salt of Hydrocortisone can be used. In many countries, the preparations of steroids have no indication for intrathecal use and alternative preparations for other indications exist. It is therefore of utmost importance that only preparations without preservatives and without Benzyl alcohol are used. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 206 BCP High Risk patients : Consolidation 1 BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 29 (TP1) . Eligible patients: High Risk patients stratified at day 29 have MRD values 5%. Patients may be stratified to the HR -protocol after day 71, but the Consolidation 1 protocol is common for HR - and IR -patients. This phase runs for 6 weeks from day 29 (begin ning of week 5) to day 70 inclusive (end of week 10). 13.13.2.1 Starting -criteria VCR and ITT -therapy on day 29 (for VCR alternatively day 30) are administered without considering peripheral blood counts - only the general condition of the patient. The platelet count should be adequate (refer to local/national guidelines) at the time of lumbar puncture, but platelets may be transfused to achieve this. Even in the case of complications during induction therapy, BM assessment day 29 is very important, since it is the basis for the stratification and should be performed on the day of the administration of day 29 chemo. The PEG -Asp on day 32 , 46 and 60 are administered regardless of when 6MP and the subsequent ARA -C doses are started. Before each administration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and no signs of pancreatitis, severe hepatic toxicity or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy ma y be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been instituted and the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy see guidelines on thrombosis and antithrombotic prophylaxis (optional ) or national/local gu idelines . Patients high remaining leukaemic cell load after induction ( 5%) must continue therapy as soon as possible. When the high MRD -value at day 29 has been confirmed , 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP), Cyclophosphamide (CPM) and ITT on day 36 is start ed, regardless of peripheral blood counts, when the general condition allows it. Once Consolidation 1 is started and the patient had an MRD of 5% at day 29, it should be completed irrespective of blood counts. There are no starting -criteria for the Cytara bine-blocks and the second Cyclophosphamide in this situation. Only serious clinical conditions, such as uncontrolled infection may interrupt therapy and such interruptions are based on individual clinical assessments. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 207 13.13.2.2 lidation 1 Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone tapering during 7 -10 days from day 29. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on day 29. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2 day given oral ly days 36 -63 (in total 28 days). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should 5 mg/m2. Cyclophosphamide (CPM) Cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 over 30 -60 min will be given on days 36 and 50. Hydration before and after cyclophosphamide according to national guidelines. Mesna before and after cyclophosphamide is optional and should be given according to national guidelines. The dose on day 50 sho uld be postponed if a BM day 50 is performed and should be omitted if therapy is shifted to HR block A1. Cytarabine (ARA -C) Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose IV push, given on (or IM) (PEG -Asp) 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) on days 32, 46 and 60. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20 000 IU/m2/dose every second day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp. Asparaginase activity monitoring (see TDM ASP guidelines ) is used to detect inactivation/distinguish between reactions with and without inactivation. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on days 29, 36 and 50. 13.13.2.3 General con siderations concerning response evaluation and supportive care Evaluation of the response to Consolidation 1 is scheduled for day 71. This bone - marrow is important for stratification and will be performed irrespective of peripheral blood counts if the patient started Consolidation 1 with high MRD (5%). NB! Patients that may be candidates for the CASSIOPEIA CAR -T trial need to get consented and take an an extra BM -sample for analysis of FCM -MRD in Oslo to be eligible . In case of a clinical suspicion of lack of response during Consolidation 1, or if Consolidation 1 therapy has to be temporarily interrupted for clinical reasons , usually because of infectious complications , a bone marrow assessment should be performed on day 50 . This check is mandatory for patients 16 years with 5% disease on day 29 who are not eligible for an ongoing CAR -T study . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 208 In such cases, the Cyclophosphamide day 50 should be postponed one day to receive the FCM -results. If the MRD in such an early assessment is 0.5% by FCM (PCR -results do not have to be waited for), the therapy should be switched to the first HR -block (block A) , which may be started as soon as the general condition of the patient allows it instead of continuing Consolidation 1. The national PI should be kept informed of such patients. In any uncertainty, s uch cases should be discussed with the national coordinator or the international study chair before the change of therapy . Prophylaxis against invasive fungal infection: The High -Risk therapy is highly immunosuppressive. Particularly in combination with inadequate early response, long periods of myelosuppression can be anticipated and prophylactic antifungal therapy according to local or national guidelines is mandatory in addition to prophylaxis against Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia until the start of oral Maintenance . Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia continues throughout therapy. Intrathecal therapy during Consolidation 1 Patients with CNS1 and TLP without leukaemic cells (TLP -) at diagnosis and patients with CNS2/TLP+ and low cell count at diagnosis, who have responded well to initial single Mtx continue with single Mtx. Patients with CNS2/TLP+ and slow response and patients with CNS3/TLP+ with 5 cells/microL CSF at diagnosis continue with ITT throughout therapy. Patients with remaining leukaemic cells in the CSF day 29 continue with weekly ITTs until CSF is clear in 2 consecutive samples (CNS -remission) - possible extra doses days 43, 57 and 64. Patients with remaining leukaemic contamination of the CSF at the end of Consolida tion 1 have Protocol Therapy Failure (primary event in the EFS analysis). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 209 High Risk Block A1 BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 71 (TP2) . If the BM day 71 is not of optimal qulity, it may be repeated at the start of the block (day 78) and will, if of better quality, be counted as the stratifying bone -marrow Eligible patients: Both patients continuing on the High -Risk arm and patients with an indiction for HSCT will tart high -risk block therapy. Patients continuing on the High -Risk chemo arm have to - be <16 years at diagnosis and - have a day 29 MRD 5% and day 71 MRD <0.05% or - be NCI high -risk at diagnosis and have MRD on day 71 0.0 1% and <0.05% (and not have a CAR -T study available ) or - have remaining extramedullary disease at the end of Consolidation 1. Patients with an additional indication for HSCT - have MRD at day 29 5% and MRD day 50 0.5% and do not have a CAR -T study available or - have MRD day 29 5% and MRD day 71 0.05% or - are 16 years old and have any high -risk criterion. - NB! This phase applies to patients who are continuing on HR -block therapy (with or without allo -SCT). Patients who are eligible for CAR -T therapy and for whom a decision to aim for this therapy has been taken, should not start this block. Instead, interim (bridging) chemotherapy specified in the CAR -T protocol in question should be used and and preparation for CAR -T therapy should be organ ised. The HR -A block runs for approximately 4 weeks from day 71 (beginning of week 11) to day 98. Chemotherapy will be administered on protocol days 78 -83 (all within week 12), supportive therapy with G -CSF continues until ANC recovery. 13.13.3.1 Starting criteri a ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 210 For patients who are not in BM-remission on day 71 (MRD 5%), the first block A can start before day 78 irrespective of blood counts, when the general condition allows it. Once the block is started, it should be completed irrespective of blood counts. For patients in remission on day 71 , block A is started when: - ANC is 0.5x109/L and - platelet count is 80x109/L (and rising). 13.13.3.2 Antileukaemic therapy High Risk Block A1 Cyclophosphamide (CPM) Cyclophosphamide 440 mg/m2 IV infusion over 15 -60 min will be given on days 78 -82 (block days 1 -5). Hydration before and after cyclophosphamide according to national guidelines. Mesna before and after cyclophosphamide is optional and should be given according to national guidelines . Etoposide (VP-16) Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV as a 60 min infusion on days 78 - 82 (block days 1 -5). Pegylated Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) Pegylated asparaginase 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour, on day 83 (block d ay 6). Patients who starts HR A1 after a BM with high MRD day 50, should wait until 14 days from the previous PEG -Asp dose. PEG -Asp should be withheld in patients with clinical signs of pancreatitis or thrombosis. In case of allergy or s ilent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20000 IU/m2/dose every other day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS - status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Ind uction Therapy \"Summary\" on day 78 (block day 1) . Patients who s tarts HR A1 after a BM with high MRD day 50 omits this IT dose, since and IT -dose was admininstered on day 50 in Consolidation 1. G-CSF G-CSF 5 microg/kg i.m., s.c. or i.v. should be administered starting 1 -5 days after PEG -Asp and be given for at least five days and until the neutrophi ls are >10x109/L once, >3.0x109/L for three days, or the patient fulfils the criteria for initiation of the next HR -block whichever occurs first. Withdraw G -CSF at least 24 h before start of chemotherapy. Other G -CSF analouges (including pegylated forms) m ay be used with adequate dosage adjustments. 13.13.3.3 General considerations regarding response evaluation For patients not in remission before the start of the block, a BM -examination should be performed 15 -20 days after the start of the block (day 92 -96). The result of this BM-examination will guide the start of the next block as well as further HR -therapy. In case of aplasia without recovery of normal haematopoiesis at this time -point, weekly BM-examinations should follow until regeneration. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 211 High Risk Block B1 BM examination will be performed at the start of each HR -block until MRD is not detectable . Eligible patients: HR-chemo or HR -SCT stratification. This phase runs for approximately 3 weeks from protocol day 99 (beginning of week 15) to day 119. Chemotherapy will be administered on protocol days 99 -105 (all within week 15), supportive therapy with G -CSF continues until ANC recovery. 13.13.4.1 Starting criteri a For patients who are not in remission after block A1 (bone -marrow taken 15 -20 days after the start of Block A1 or subsequent BM -examinations following this block with MRD<5%), Block B1 starts irrespective of blood counts, when the general condition allow s it. Once the block is started, it should be completed irrespective of blood counts. Patients in remission after Block A1 should be in good clinical condition without serious infection, diarrhoea, mucositis and effusions (second compartments). In addtion, block B1 can be started when: - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelet count 80x109/L (and rising) and - renal function should be normal and - aminotransferases should not excee d >10 x the ULN and The block should start no sooner than 3 weeks (21 days) from the start of the previous block. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 212 13.13.4.2 Antileukaemic therapy High Risk Block B1 Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone 20 mg/m2/day, given orally, divided in three doses on days 99 -103 (block days 1 -5). 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 100 mg/m2/day given orally days 99 (block days 1 -5). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 10 mg/m2. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine given at 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2.0 mg), IV push or as a short infusio n (15 min) on days 99 and 103 (block days 1 and 5). It is allowed to move the VCR - doses one day forward to avoid giving the first dose on the same day as the intrathecal therapy. Methotrexate (HD-MTX) Methotrexate 5000 mg/m2 is given as a 24 -hour continuous infusion on day 99 (block day 1). 10% of the dose is administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% in the following 23 hours. Folinic acid 15mg/m2 of the racemic preparation or 7.5mg/m2 of the L - isomeric product intravenously at 42, 48 and 54 hours after the start of each Methotrexate infusion. The dose of Folinic acid and the hydration should be adjusted according to the Mtx-concentration and kidney function and Folinic acid rescue should be continued 6 -hourly until the Mtx - concentration is <0.2 micromol/L. Do not cap the dose. Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Extreme Mtx -concentration and severely impaired kidney function may indicate the use of Carboxy -peptidase. Refer to Carboxy (HD-Ara-C) High-dose cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 IV is given twice daily (12 hours between start of infusions) as a 3 -hour infusion on days 103 -104 (block days 5 -6). Glucocorticoid eyedrops should be given at 6 hours intervals from the start of the first HD -Ara-C infusion and at least until 48 hours aft er the last (fourth) infusion. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS -status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on day 99 (block da y 1). Pegylated Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) Pegylated asparaginase 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on day 105 (block day 7). PEG -Asp should be withheld in patients with clinical signs of pancreatitis or thrombosis. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20000 IU/m2/dose every other day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses. G-CSF G-CSF 5 microg/kg i.m., s.c. or i.v. should be administered starting 1 -5 days after PEG -Asp and be given for at least five days and until the neutrophils are >10x109/L once, >3.0x109/L for three days, or the patient fulfils the criteria for initiation of of the next HR -block whichever occurs first. Withdraw G -CSF at least 24 h before start of chemotherapy. Other G -CSF analouges (including pegylated forms) may be used with adequate dosage adjustments. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 213 13.13.4.3 General con siderations regarding response evaluation and supportive care For patients not in remission before the start of the block, a BM -examination should be performed 15 -20 days after the start of the block (day 113 -117). The result of this BM-examination will guide the start of the next block as well as further HR -therapy. In case of aplasia without recovery of normal haematopoiesis at this time -point, weekly BM-examinations should follow until regeneration. Drug interactions Drugs which compromise renal function, e.g. aminoglycosides and non -steroid anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAID), can decrease clearance of methotrexate and lead to systemic toxicit y and should therefore be avoided during this phase. Methotrexate clearance is also hampered by proton -pump inhibitors, which should also be avoided. The administration of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) carries significant potential toxicity which in extreme cases can be fatal. This is prevented by effective folinic acid rescue. Absolute compliance with the schedule of hydration, monitoring of levels and folinic acid rescue is mandatory in this phase of the protocol. It is vital to rea d this section of the protocol before commencing administration of HDMTX . Please als o ensure that you have made certain that your patient has no contraindication to HDMTX. Please note that to be eligible for entry into this phase renal function should be within normal limits corrected for age. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 214 High Risk Block C1 BM examination will be performed at the start of each HR -block until MRD is not detectable. Eligible Patients: HR-chemo or HR -SCT stratification. This phase runs for approximately 3 weeks from protocol day 120 (beginning of week 18) to day 140. Chemotherapy will be administered on protocol days 120 -126 (all within week 18) , supportive therapy with G -CSF continues until ANC recovery. 13.13.5.1 Starting criteria For patients who are not in remission after block A1 and B1 (bone -marrow taken 15 - 20 days after the start of Block B1 or subsequent BM -examinations following this block with MRD 5%), Block C1 starts irrespective of blood counts, when the general condition allows it. Once the block is started, it should be completed irrespective of blood counts. Patients in remission after Block B1 should be in good clinical condition without serious infection,and at most mild and improving mucositis. In addtion, block C1 can be started when: - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelet count 80x109/L (and rising) The block should start no sooner than 3 we eks (21 days) from the start of the previous block.

In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20000 IU/m2/dose every other day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses. G-CSF G-CSF 5 microg/kg i.m., s.c. or i.v. should be administered starting 1 -5 days after PEG -Asp and be given for at least five days and until the neutrophils are >10x109/L once, >3.0x109/L for three days, or the pat ient fulfils the criteria for initiation of of the next HR -block whichever occurs first. Withdraw G -CSF at least 24 h before start of chemotherapy. Other G -CSF analouges (including pegylated forms) may be used with adequate dosage adjustments. 13.13.5.3 General co nsiderations regarding response evaluation For patients not in remission before the start of the block, a BM -examination should be performed 15 -20 days after the start of the block (day 134 -138). The result of this BM-examination will guide the start of the next block as well as further HR -therapy. In case of aplasia without recovery of normal haematopoiesis at this time -point, weekly BM-examinations should follow until Patients with exist) leukaemic cells at this time -point are considered as Protocol Therapy Failure (leukaemic adverse event) and may be taken off protocol therapy at the discretion of the treating physician. However, it may be assessed that continued protocol treatment is the best option. Patients going on to allo -SCT should have an acceptable MRD -value after C 1 to go on to SCT, but may require additional blocks to achieve this (see section on allo -SCT in ALLTogether). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 216 High Risk Block A2 BM examination will be performed at the start of each HR -block until MRD is not detectable. Eligible patients: HR-stratification. Block A 1, block B 1, and block C 1 should always be the first three blocks. For patients with good response to A1, or who were in remission at the start of the H R-blocks, the subsequent block order is A2 -B2-C2. Thus, A2 is the default block after C1 for most patients. For patients with poor response to initial block therapy or clinical problems after the blocks, the order after A1 -B1-C1 may be individualised cons idering the previous MRD response, the subset of disease, and the pattern of toxicities. Most patients receiving this block will have been stratified to the HR -chemo arm. However, patients going on to allo -SCT should have acceptable an MRD -value to go on to SCT and may require additional blocks to achieve this (see section on allo -SCT in ALLTogether). This block runs for approximately 3 weeks. Chemotherapy will be administered the first 6 days, supportive therapy with G -CSF continues until ANC recovery . 13.13.6.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in good good clinical condition without serious infection,and at most mild and improving mucositis . In addition Block A2 can be started when: - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelet count 80x109/L (and rising). The block should start no sooner than 3 weeks (21 days) from the start of the previous block.

Hydration befo re and after cyclophosphamide according to national guidelines. Mesna before and after cyclophosphamide is optional and should be given according to national guidelines. Etoposide (VP-16) Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV as a 60 min block days 1-5. Pegylated Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) Pegylated asparaginase 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on block day 6. PEG -Asp should be withheld in patients with clinical signs of pancreatitis or thrombosi s. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20000 IU/m2/dose every other day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS - status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on block day 1. G-CSF G-CSF 5 microg/kg i.m., s.c. or i.v. should be a dministered starting 1 -5 days after PEG -Asp and be given for at least five days and until the neutrophils are >10x109/L once, >3.0x109/L for three days, or the patient fulfils the criteria for initiation of the next HR -block whichever occurs first. Withdraw G -CSF at least 24 h before start of chemotherapy. Other G -CSF analouges (including pegylated forms) may be used with adequate dosage adjustments. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 218 High Risk Block B2 BM examination will be performed at the start of each HR -block until MRD is not detectable. Eligible patients: HR-stratification. Block A 1, block B 1, and block C 1 should always be the first three blocks. For patients with good response to A1, or who were in remission at the start of the HR -blocks, the subsequent block order is A2 -B2-C2. Thus, B2 is the default block after A2 for most patients. For patients with poor response to initial block therapy or clinical problems after the blocks, the order after A1 -B1-C1 may be individualised considering the previous MRD respons e, the subset of disease, and the pattern of toxicities. Most patients receiving this block will have been stratified to the HR -chemo arm. However, patients going on to allo -SCT should have acceptable an MRD -value to go on to SCT and may require additional blocks to achieve this (see section on allo -SCT in ALLTogether). This block runs for approximately 3 weeks. Chemotherapy will be administered the first 7 days, supportive therapy with G -CSF continues until ANC recovery. 13.13.7.1 Starting criteria The patient sh ould be in good clinical condition without serious infection, diarrhoea, mucositis and effusions (second compartments). In addtion, block B2 can be started when: - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelet count 80x109/L (and rising) and - renal function should be normal and - aminotransferases should not exceed >10 x the ULN and The block should start no sooner than 3 weeks (21 days) from the start of the previous block. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 219 13.13.7.2 Antileukaemic therapy High Risk Block B2 Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone 20 mg/m2/day, given orally, divided in three doses on block days 1 -5. 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 100 mg/m2/day given orally on block 1 -5. In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT - deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 10 mg/m2. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine given at 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2.0 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on block days 1 and 5. It is allowed to move the VCR -doses one day forward to avoid giving the first dose on the same day a s the intrathecal therapy. Methotrexate (HD-MTX) Methotrexate 5000 mg/m2 is given as a 24 -hour continuous infusion on block day 1. 10% of the dose is administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% in the following 23 hours. Folinic acid 15mg/m2 of the racemic preparation or 7.5mg/m2 of the L - isomeric product intravenously at 42, 48 and 54 hours after the start of each Methotrexate infusion. The dose of Folinic acid and the hydration should be adjusted according to the Mtx-concentration an d kidney function and Folinic acid rescue should be continued 6 -hourly until the Mtx - concentration is <0.2 micromol/L. Do not cap the dose. Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Extreme Mtx -concentration and severely impaired kidney function may indicate the use of Carboxy -peptidase. Refer to Carboxypeptidase guidelines (HD-Ara-C) High-dose cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 IV is given twice daily (12 hours between start of infusions) as a 3 -hour infusion on block days 5 -6. Glucocorticoid eyedrops should be given at 6 hours intervals from the start of the first HD -Ara-C infusion and at least until 48 hours after the last (fo urth) infusion. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS -status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on block day 1. Pegylated Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) Pegylated asparaginase 1500 IU/m2 IV (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on block day 7. PEG -Asp should be withheld in patients with clinical signs of pancreatitis or thrombosis. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20000 IU/m2/dose every other day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses. G-CSF G-CSF 5 microg/kg i.m., s.c. or i.v. should be administered starting 1 -5 days after PEG -Asp and be given for at least five days and until the neutrophils are >10x109/L once, >3.0x109/L for three days, or the patient fulfils the criteria for initiation of of the next HR -block whichever occurs first. Withdraw G -CSF at least 24 h before star t of chemotherapy. Other G -CSF analouges (including pegylated forms) may be used with adequate dosage adjustments. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 220 13.13.7.3 General considerations and supportive care Drug interactions Drugs which compromise renal function, e.g. aminoglycosides and non -steroid anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAID), can decrease c learance of methotrexate and lead to systemic toxicity and should therefore be avoided during this phase. Methotrexate clearance is also hampered by proton -pump inhibitors, which should also be avoided. The administration of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) carries significant potential toxicity which in extreme cases can be fatal. This is prevented by effective folinic acid rescue. Absolute compliance with the schedule of hydration, monitoring of levels and folinic acid rescue is mandatory in this phase of the protocol. It is vital to rea d this section of the protocol before commencing administration of HDMTX . Please als o ensure that you have made certain that your patient has no contraindication to HDMTX. Please note that to be eligible for entry into this phase renal function should be within normal limits corrected for age. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 221 High Risk Block C2 BM examination will be performed at the start of each HR -block until MRD is not detectable. Eligible patients: HR-stratification. Block A 1, block B 1, and block C 1 should always be the first three blocks. For patients with good response to A1, or who were in remission at the start of the HR -blocks, the subsequent block order is A2 -B2-C2. Thus, C2 is the default block after B2 for most patients. For patients with poor response to initial block therapy or clinical problems after the blocks, the order after A1 -B1-C1 may be indiv idualised considering the previous MRD response, the subset of disease, and the pattern of toxicities. Most patients receiving this block will have been stratified to the HR -chemo arm. However, patients going on to allo -SCT should have acceptable an MRD -value to go on to SCT and may require additional blocks to achieve this (see section on allo -SCT in ALLTogether). This block runs for approximately 3 weeks. Chemotherapy will be administered the first 7 days, supportive therapy with G -CSF continues until ANC recovery. 13.13.8.1 Starting criteria The patient should be in good good clinical condition without serious infection,a nd at most mild and improving mucositis In addition Block C2 can be started when: - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelet count 80x109/L (and rising) and The block should start no sooner than 3 weeks (21 days) from the start of the previous block. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 222 13.13.8.2 Antileukaemic therapy High Risk Block C2 Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS -status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on block day 1. Fludarabine (Fluda) Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/dose i.v. is given daily (20 -24 hours between start of infusions) as a 30 minute infusion on block days 2 -6. Idarubicin (IDA) Idarubicin 8 mg/m2/ i.v. is given as a 60 minute infusion on block day 2. The infusion is started just after the Ara -C infusion has been stopped. Cytarabine (HD-Ara-C) High-dose cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 IV is given once daily (20-24 hours between start of infusions) as a 3 -hour infusion on block days 2 -6). Glucocorticoid eyedrops should be given at 6 hours intervals from the start of the first HD - Ara-C infusion and at least until 24 hours after the last (fifth) infusion. Pegylated Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) Pegylated asparaginase 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on block day 7.

ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 223 High Risk Maintenance 1 Eligible patients: HR-stratification (patients continuing HR -chemo therapy). The HR Maintenance 1 phase runs for 15 weeks from protocol day 204 (beginning of week 30) to day 308 inclusive (end of week 44). Due to the high risk of toxicity during the block -therapy, the likelihood of delays before this phase is very high and the protocol day designation is there for orientation relative to other pha ses in the protocol and not an indication of time from the beginning of therapy. 13.13.9.1 Starting criteria Before the start of 6MP and oral Mtx: - ANC 0.75x109/L and - platelets 75x109/L. Before HD -MTX the patient should be in good clinical condition and free of serious infection, diarrhoea, mucositis and effusions (second compartments). In addition, HD-MTX can be given, when: - ANC is 0.5x109/L and - platelets are 50x109/L and rising and - renal function should be normal and if renal function was previ ously impaired GFR should be assessed and should be >70mL/minute/1.73m2. However, prolonged Mtx -excretion during previous courses is not in itself a contra -indication for continued HDMTX -therapy and - aminotransferases should not exceed >10 x the ULN. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 224 13.13.9.2 Antileukaemic therapy High Risk Maintenance 1 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP) 6-mercaptopurine, initial dose 75 mg/m2/day orally days 204-301 -44). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. Maintenance doses will be adjusted to keep the ANC level between 0.75 -1.5 x109/L. Methotrexate (MTX) Methotrexate, initial dose 20 mg/m2/week -44) and is titrated together with 6 -mercaptopurine. During the weeks when HD -MTX is given the oral dos e is omitted. HD-Methotrexate (HD-MTX) Methotrexate 5000 mg/m2 is given as a 24 -hour continuous infusion at the beginning of week 31, 37, 4 3. 10% of the dose i s administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% in the following 23 hours. All patients must be prehydrated as per HD-MTX guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines . Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Folinic acid 15mg/m2 of the racemic preparation or 7.5mg/m2 of the L - isomeric product intravenousl y at 42, 48 and 54 hours after the start of each Methotrexate infusion. The dose of Folinic acid and the hydration should be adjusted according to the Mtx-concentration and kidney function and Folinic acid rescue should be continued 6 -hourly until the Mtx - concentration is <0.2 micromol/L. Do not cap the dose. Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Extreme Mtx -concentration and severely impaired kidney function may indicate the use of Carboxy -peptidase. Refer to Carboxypeptidase guidelines (optional) or national/local guidelines. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS - status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" , to be given immediately before or during the HD -MTX infusion . 13.13.9.3 General considerations and supportive care Drug interactions Drugs which compromise renal function, e.g. aminoglycosides and non -steroid anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAID), can decrease cl earance of methotrexate and lead to systemic toxicity and should therefore be avoided during this phase. Methotrexate clearance is also hampered by proton -pump inhibitors, which should also be avoided. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia: Due to methotrexate metabolism interaction it is preferable if co -trimoxazole prophylaxis is organised to stop >24 hours to the planned HD -MTX -infusion, and restart after completion of MTX -excretion at the earliest. The administration of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) carries significant potential toxicity which in extreme cases can be fatal. This is prevented by effective folinic acid rescue. Absolute compliance with the schedule of hydration, monitoring of levels and folinic acid rescue is mandatory in this phase of the protocol. It is vital to rea d this section of the protocol before commencing administration of HDMTX . Please als o ensure that you have made certain that your patient has no contraindication to HDMTX. Please note that to be eligible for entry into this phase renal function should be within normal limits corrected for age.

In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be 20 mg/m2. Cytarabine (ARA -C) Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose IV push, given on days 332 -335 and 339 -342 (block days 24 -27 and 31 -34). The first course starts irrespective of blood counts if the requirements for start of 6TG on day 330 were fulfilled. Once the first 4 -day ARA-C course has been initiated, both 4 -days ARA -C courses should be given without interruption, if the patient's condition allows it. 13.13.10.3 General considerations and supportive care Once started, th e Cytarabine blocks should be given without interruptions. If Cytarabine has to be postponed or interrupted for clinical reasons, 6 -thioguanine should also be interrupted. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 227 High Risk Maintenance 2 Eligible patients: HR-stratification (patients continuing HR -chemo therapy ). The Maintenance phase runs in 8 -week cycles from the beginning of week 51 until the end of therapy exactly 2 years from achieved complete remission. Once maintenance is started the clock does not stop regardless of whether tr eatment is given or not. Only Mercaptopurine and oral Methotrexate will be interrupted for myelosuppression and the time is not be made up. Days off therapy for intercurrent infections are counted as days of maintenance and thus no compensation is made for interruptions in treatment. 13.13.11.1 Starting criteria HR Maintenance 2 is started when: - ANC 0.75x109/L and - platelets 75x109/L. 13.13.11.2 Antileukaemic therapy High- Risk Maintenance 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine, initial dose 75 mg/m2/day orally up to 2 years from complete remission (25 months, 108 weeks). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 5 mg/m2. Maintenance doses will be adjusted to keep the ANC level between 0.75 -1.5 x109/L. Methotrexate (MTX) Methotrexate, initial dose 20 mg/m2/week orally is continued until the end of therapy (25 months, 108 weeks) and is titrated together with 6 -mercaptopurine. During the week when intrathecal therapy is given the oral dose is omitted or adjusted to an approp riate total dose depending on the size of the patient. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS - status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" , given at the start of Maintenance 2 (week 51, day 351) and 8 -weekly throughout Maintenance 2. 13.13.11.3 General considerations and supportive care: For detailed instructions on the steering of Maintenance -therapy refer to protocol Maintenance guidelines . ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 228 13.14 Post -induction High -Risk (HR) Treatment for T -cell-patients Summary TREATMENT PHASE DURATION COMMENTS/DETAILS OF TREATMENTS Consolidation 1 6 weeks (weeks 5 -10) Assessment of MRD day 50. If poor response, shift to Nelarabine -containing therapy Nelarabine From week 8 or 11 Given if inadequate response to Consolidation 1 - alone or with Cons 1 HR-blocks A -B-C 10 weeks (weeks 11 -20) In preparation for HSCT - mainly given to poor responders to Nelarabine HR-blocks will only be used for patients responding poorly to Nelarabine in preparation for HSCT. The aim with th is HR block -therapy is to reduce the MRD to an acceptable level before HSCT and 1 -3 blocks are usually sufficient, but additional blocks may be needed. Block A 1 block B 1, and block C 1 should always be the first three blocks. For patients with poor response to initial block therapy or with clinical problems after the blocks, the order of the possible subsequent additional block s may be individualised considering the previous MRD response, the subset of disease, and the pattern of toxicities. Patients <16 years with poor response to induction therapy (MRD 5%) day 29 may still be stratified to IR -high if the response to Consolidation 1 results in a low MRD - level day 50 (<0.5%) and an undetectable MRD -level day 71. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 229 From Table 14: Dosing of intrathecal single Methotrexate and intrathecal triple therapy (ITT) by age: Age 1 -<2 2-<3 3 Single Mtx dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Triple Intrathecal (ITT) dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Cytarabine 20 mg 25 mg 30 mg Alternative steroids in ITT Hydrocortisone Succinate* or 16 mg 20 mg 24 mg Prednisolone Sodium Succinate or 4 mg 5 mg 6 mg Methyl -Prednisolone Sodium Succinate 3.2 mg 4 mg 4.8 mg *Both the Hemisuccinate - and the Sodium succinate salt of Hydrocortisone can be used. In many countries, the preparations of steroids have no indication for intrathecal use and alternative preparations for other indications exist. It is therefore of utmost importance that only preparations without preservatives and without Benzyl alcohol are used. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 230 T-cell High Risk patients: Standard Consolidation 1 BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 29 (TP1) . Eligible patients: Preliminary T -cell high r isk patients stratified at day 29 have MRD values 5%. Patients may be stratified to the HR -protocol after day 71, but the Consolidation 1 protocol is common for HR - and IR -patients. This phase runs for 6 weeks from day 29 (beginning of week 5) to day 70 inclusive (end of week 10). 13.14.2.1 Starting -criteria VCR and ITT -therapy on day 29 (for VCR alternatively day 30) are administered without considering peripheral blood counts - only the general condition of the patient . The platelet count should be adequate (refer to local/national guidelines) at the time of lumbar puncture, but platelets may be transfused to achieve this. Even in the case of complications during induction therapy, BM assessment day 29 is very importan t, since it is the basis for the stratification and should be performed on the day of the administration of day 29 chemo. The PEG -Asp on day 32 and 46 are administered regardless of when 6MP and the subsequent ARA -C doses are started. Before each administ ration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and no signs of pancreatitis, severe hepatic toxicity or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been instituted and the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy see guidelines on thrombosis and antithrombotic prophylaxis (optional ) or national/local guidelines . Patients with high remaining leukaemic cell load after induction ( 5%) must continue therapy as soon as possible. When the high MRD -value at day 29 has been confirmed, 6 -Mercaptopurine (6MP), Cyclophosphamide (CPM) and ITT on day 36 is started, regardless of peripheral blood counts, when the general condition allows it. Once Consolidation 1 is started and the patient had an MRD of 5% at day 29, it should continue until the day 50 MRD assessment irrespective of blood counts. Only serious clinical conditions, such as uncontrolled infection may interrupt therapy and such interruptions are bas ed on individual clinical assessments. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 231 13.14.2.2 Antileukaemic therapy High Risk Consolidation 1 Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone tapering during 7 -10 days from day 29. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on day 29. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2 day given oral ly days 36 -63 (in total 28 days). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should 5 mg/m2. Cyclophosphamide (CPM) Cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 over 30 -60 min will be given on days 36 and 51 or 52 (pending the day 50 FCM - MRD result) . Hydration before and after cyclophosphamide according to national guidelines. Mesna before and after cyclophosphamide is optional and should be given according to national guidelines. Cytarabine (ARA -C) Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose IV push, given on (or IM) (PEG -Asp) 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) on days 32, 46 and 60. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20 000 IU/m2/dose every second day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp. Asparaginase activity monitoring (see 'TDM ASP guidelines' ) is used to detect inactivation/distinguish betwee n reactions with and without inactivation. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on da ys 29, 36 and 43 . 13.14.2.3 General considerations concerning response evaluation and supportive care The first evaluation of the response to Consolidation 1 is scheduled for day 50. This bone -marrow is important for stratification and will be performed irrespective of peripheral blood counts if the patient started Consolidation 1 with high MRD (5%). Patients with MRD <0.5% day 50 continue with Standard Consolidation 1 for T -cell patients and response is further evaluated on day 71 (after count recovery) . Patients with MRD 5% day 50 shift to Single -dose Nelarabine for days - - T-cell Cons -single (see below) Patients 0.5% but <5% day 50 shift to Nelarabine for 5 days followed by the rest of Consolidation 1 - T-cell Consolidation 1+Nelarabine -Addition (see below) . Intrathecal therapy during ion Patients with CNS1 and TLP without leukaemic cells (TLP -) at diagnosis and patients ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 232 with CNS2/TLP+ and low cell count at diagnosis, who have responded well to initial single Mtx continue with single Mtx. Patients with CNS2/TLP+ and slow response and patients with CNS3/TLP+ with 5 cells/microL CSF at diagnosis continue with ITT throughout therapy. Patients with remaining leukaemic cells in the CSF day 29 continue with weekly ITTs until CSF is clear in 2 consecutive samples (CNS -remission) - possible extra doses days 43, 57 and 64. Patients with remaining leukaemic contamination of the CSF at the end of Consolidation 1 have Protocol Therapy Failure (primary event in the EFS analysis). Prophylaxis against invasive fungal infection: The High -Risk therapy is highly immunosuppressive. Particularly in combination with inadequate early response, long periods of myelosuppression can be anticipated and prophylactic antifungal therapy according to local or national guidelines is mandatory in addition to prophylaxis against Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia until the start of oral Maintenance. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia continues throughout therapy. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 233 T-cell High Risk Consolidation 1 + Nelarabine Single BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 50 . Eligible patients: T-cell high risk patients with day 29 MRD values 5% and day 50 MRD 5% (by FCM) . The shift in therapy is from day 51 onwards This phase runs for slightly less than 3 weeks from day 51 (third day of week 8 ) to day 70 (end of week 10). 13.14.3.1 Starting -criteria Patients with a high remaining leukaemic cell load after induction and the first part of Standard consolidation 1 must continue therapy as soon as possible and no haematological start -criteria apply. However, serious neurotoxicity may contraindicate the u se of Nelarabine: Previous central neurotoxicity must have resolved and previous peripheral neurotoxicity may not exceed grade 1. If any of these contraindications apply, the patient shouldproceed to high -risk block therapy when the clinical condition allo ws. NB! There should be at least one week between the last intrathecal injection and the start of Nelarabine. 13.14.3.2 Antileukaemic therapy T-cell High Risk Consolidation 1 + Nelarabine Single Nelarabine (Nel) Nelarabine given IV over 1 -hour, 650 mg/m2 once daily for 5 consecutive days (day 51 -55) age 1 -20 years or 1500 mg/m2 day 51, 53 and 55 (3 doses alternate days) age 21 - 45. Intrathecal therapy No intrathecal therapy will be given during the block when Nelarabine has been administered. This also applies to patients with slowly responding CNS -disease. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 234 13.14.3.3 Response evaluation The evaluation of the response to the T -cell Consolidation 1 +Nelarabine Single is scheduled for day 65 (15 days after start of the Nelarabine block) and will be carried out regardless of peripheral blood counts. Patients with MRD <0. 01% day 65 may be given a second course of 5 -day Nelarabine (Nelarabine Single block) , when the result of the MRD -evaluation has arrived (preliminarily d ay 72 at the beginning of week 12). Therapy will aim for HSCT as soon as the clinical condition allows. Patients with MRD 0.01% may proceed with a Nelarabine Single block day 72 (21 days after start of the Nelarabine block) if it is assessed that the first Nelarabine has had adequate effect (depending on the relative reduction in leukaemic cell burden) or shift to high -risk block A day 72 - or as soon as the clinical condition allows, if it is assessed that the effect of Nelarabine was insufficient. Therapy will aim to reduce MRD sufficiently for HSCT to be carried out. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 235 T-cell High Risk Consolidation 1 + Nelarabine Addition BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 50 . Eligible patients: T-cell high risk patients with day 29 MRD values 5 % and day 50 MRD <5% (by FCM). The shift in therapy is from day 51 onwards This phase runs for slightly less than 4 weeks from day 51 (third day of week 8 ) to day 77 inclusive (end of week 11 ). 13.14.4.1 Starting -criteria Patients with a significant remaining leukaemic cell load after induction and the first part of Standard consolidation 1 must continue therapy as soon as possible and no haematological start -criteria apply. However, s erious neurotoxicity may contraindicate the use of Nelarabine : Previous central neurotoxicity must have resolved and previous peripheral neurotoxicity may not exceed grade 1. If any of these contraindications apply, the patient should proceed to high -risk block therapy when the clinical condition allows. NB! There should be at least one week between the last intrathecal injection and the start of Nelarabine.

Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on day 65. 13.14.4.3 Response evaluation The evaluation of the response to the T -cell Consolidation 1+Nelarabine Addition is scheduled for day 78 and will be carried out regardless of peripheral blood counts. Patients with MRD <0.01 % day 78 may be given a second course of 5 -day Nelarabine (Nelar abine Single block) , when the result of the MRD -evaluation has arrived (preliminarily day 85 at the beginning of week 1 3). Therapy will aim for HSCT as soon as the clinical condition allows. Patients with MRD 0.01% day 78 may proceed with a Nelarabine Single block if it is assessed that the first Nelarabine has had adequate effect (depending on the relative reduction in leukaemic cell burden) or shift to high -risk block A when the result of the MRD -evaluation has arrived - or as soon as the clinical condition allows, if it is assessed that the effect of Nelarabine was insufficient. Therapy will aim to reduce MRD sufficiently for HSCT to be carried out. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 237 T-cell High Risk Nelarabine Single block BM examination for stratification/evaluation of Nelarabine response has been performed on day 71 or day 78 Eligible patients: T-cell patients, who had - MRD <5% at day 29, but MRD 0.05 % on day 71 (shift from preliminary IR risk - group stratification ) - start day 78. - MRD 5% on day 29, MRD <0.5% day 50, who received Standard Consolidation 1 but had MRD 0.01% on day 71 - start day 78. - MRD 5% on day 29, MRD 0.5 but <5% day 50 , who received Consolidation 1 + Nelarabine Addition and was assessed as responder - start day 85. - MRD 5% on day 29, MRD 5% day 50, who received Consolidation 1 + Nelarabine Single and was assessed as responder - start day 71. This phase runs for 3 weeks from day 78 or 85 to day 98 or 105 depending on the protocol day start (see above) . 13.14.5.1 Starting -criteria Patients should be in acceptable clinical condition, particularly with regard to previous neurotoxicity. Patients who have had Nelarabine previously must not have had any neurotoxicity assessed as caused by Nelarabine exceeding CTCAE grade 1 . Previous central neurotoxicity not attributed to Nelarabine must have resolved and previous p eripheral neurotoxicity not attributed to Nelarabine may not exceed grade 1. NB! There should be at leas t one week between the last intrathecal injection and the s tart of Nelarabine. In addition - before start of Nelarabine Single block - ANC should be 0.5 x109/L and - platelets should be 50x109/L and rising. 13.14.5.2 Antileukaemic therapy T -cell High Risk Nelarabine Single block Nelarabine (Nel) Nelarabine given IV over 1 -hour, 650 mg/m2 once daily for 5 consecutive days ( day 78 -82 (or 85 -89, respectively) ) age 1-20 years or 1500 mg/m2 day 78, 80 and 82 (or 85, 87 and 89, respectively) (3 doses alternate days) age 21-45. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 238 13.14.5.3 Response evaluation The response evaluation after the Nelarabine Single block depends on the indication for this block: Patients who were up -graded from a presumed IR -stratification after day 29 or following High Risk Standard Consolidation 1 (because of MRD 0.01% day 71) should have the response -evaluation on day 92 and may, if the response is considered adequate, repeat the Nelarabine Single block starting day 99. If the response day 92 is considered inadequate, high risk block therapy (block A) should start day 92 or as soon as the clinical condition permits . Therapy will aim to reduce MRD sufficiently for HSCT to be carried out. Patients who had adequate response to the first Nelarabine -containing therapy element (Consolidation 1 + Nelarabine Addition or Consolidation 1 + Nelarabine Single) should have the response evaluated day 92 if MRD preceding the block was 0.01%. If the MRD preceding the block was <0,01% or not detectable, the next MRD assessment may await an adequate time -point before HSCT. Therapy will aim to reduce MRD sufficiently for HSCT to be carried out. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 239 T-cell High Risk Block A BM examination will have been performed at day 71, day 78 or day 92 depending on the previous response to Induction and initial Consolidation and Nelarabine. A BM examination for assessment of MRD at the beginning of the block is recommended if the quality of the preceding BM examination was sub -optimal or if the start of the block had to be postponed for clinical reasons. Eligible patients: T-cell patients with high -risk stratification and inadequate a Nelarabine -containing tre atment -element (MRD 0.01%) contra -indications for Nelarabine therapy . Therapy should aim for HSCT as soon as the MRD has reached an acceptable level and the general condition allows. The sequence of the blocks is A -B-C, but the first block that is shown to be effective in achieving an adequate MRD -level for HSCT may be repeated if holding chemotherapy is necessary before HSCT for logistic reasons. This block runs for approximately 3 weeks. Chemotherapy will be administered the first 6 days, supportive therapy with G -CSF continues until ANC recovery. 13.14.6.1 Starting criteria Patients with a high remaining leukaemic cell load must continue therapy as soon as possible and no haematological start -criteria apply. In patients who have reached clinical remission, but have inadequate MRD -response for HSCT , block A can be started when: - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelet count 80x109/L (and rising). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 240 13.14.6.2 Antileukaemic therapy High Risk Block A Cyclophosphamide (CPM) Cyclophosphamide 440 mg/m2 IV infusion over 15 -60 min will be given on block days 1 -5. Hydration before and after cyclophosphamide according to national guidelines. Mesna before and after cyclophosphamide is optional and should be given according to national guidelines. Etop oside (VP-16) Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV as a 60 block days 1-5. Pegylated Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) Pegylated asparaginase 1500 IU/m2 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on block day 6. PEG -Asp should be withheld in patients with clinical signs of pancreatitis or thrombosis. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20000 IU/m2/dose every other day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses. Intratheca l therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS - status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on block day 1. G-CSF G-CSF 5 microg/kg i.m., s.c. or i.v. s hould be administered starting 1 -5 days after PEG -Asp and be given for at least five days and until the neutrophils are >10x109/L once, >3.0x109/L for three days, or the patient fulfils the criteria for initiation of the next HR -block whichever occurs first. Withdraw G -CSF at least 24 h before start of chemotherapy. Other G -CSF analouges (including pegylated forms) may be used with adequate dosage adjustments. 13.14.6.3 Response evaluation For patients not in remission before the start of the block, a BM-examination should be performed 15 -20 days after the start of the block. The result of this BM - examination will guide the start of the next block as well as further HR -therapy and the timing of HSCT (see above). In case of aplasia without recovery of no rmal haematopoiesis at this time -point, weekly BM -examinations should follow until regeneration. For patients in clinical remission before the start of the block, the quality of the BM MRD -assessment is improved if count recovery is awaited. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 241 T-cell High Risk Block B BM examination will have been 15 -21 days after the start of HR -block A or after count recovery. A BM examination for assessment of MRD at the beginning of the block is recommended if the quality of the preceding BM examination was sub-optimal or if the start of the block had to be postponed for clinical reasons. Eligible patients: T-cell patients with high -risk stratification and inadequate response to preceding HR -therapy including block A. Therapy should aim for HSCT as soon as the MRD has reached an acceptable level and the general condition allows. The sequence of the blocks is A -B-C, but the first block that is shown to be effective in achieving an adequate MRD -level for HSCT may be repeated if holding chemotherapy is necessa ry before HSCT for logistic reasons. This block runs for approximately 3 weeks. Chemotherapy will be administered the first 7 days, supportive therapy with G -CSF continues until ANC recovery. 13.14.7.1 Starting criteria Patients with a high remaining leukaemic cell load must continue therapy as soon as possible and no haematological start -criteria apply. However, the patient should not have signs of effusions (second compartments) and should also have adequate renal funct ion. In patients who have reached clinical remission, but have inadequate MRD -response for HSCT , block B can be started when: - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelet count 80x109/L (and rising) and - aminotransferases should not exceed >10 x the ULN The block should start no sooner than 3 weeks (21 days) from the start of the previous A block. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 242 13.14.7.2 Antileukaemic therapy High Risk Block B Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone 20 mg/m2/day, given orally, divided in three doses on block days 1 -5. 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 100 mg/m2/day given orally on block 1 -5. In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT - deficiency, the dose should be reduced to 10 mg/m2. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine given at 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2.0 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on block days 1 and 5. It is allowed to move the VCR -doses one day forward to avoid giving the first dose on the same day as the intrathecal therapy. Methotrexate (HD-MTX) Methotrexate 5000 mg/m2 is given as a 24 -hour continuous infusion on block day 1. 10% of the dose is administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% in the following 23 hours. Folinic acid 15mg/m2 of the racemic preparation or 7.5mg/m2 of the L - isomeric product intravenously at 42, 48 and 54 hours after the start of each Methotrexate infusion. The dose of Folinic acid and the hydration should be adjusted according to the Mtx-concentration and kidney function and Folinic acid rescue should be continued 6 -hourly until the Mtx - conc entration is <0.2 micromol/L. Do not cap the dose. Timings of drug administration must be followed strictly. Extreme Mtx -concentration and severely impaired kidney function may indicate the use of Carboxy -peptidase. Refer to Carboxypeptidase guidelines (HD-Ara-C) High-dose cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 IV is given twice daily (12 hours between start of infusions) as a 3 -hour infusion on block days 5 -6. Glucocorticoid eyedrops should be given at 6 hours intervals from the start of the first HD -Ara-C infusion and at least until 48 hours after the last (fo urth) infusion. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS -status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" on block day 1. Pegylated Asparaginase (PEG -Asp) Pegylated asparaginase 1500 IU/m2 IV (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on block day 7. PEG -Asp should be withheld in patients with clinical signs of pancreatitis or thrombosis. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20000 IU/m2/dose every other day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a total of 7 doses. G-CSF G-CSF 5 microg/kg i.m., s.c. or i.v. should be administered starting 1 -5 days after PEG -Asp and be given for at least five days and until the neutrophils are >10x109/L once, >3.0x109/L for three days, or the patient fulfils the criteria for initiation of of the next HR -block whichever occurs first. Withdraw G -CSF at least 24 h before start of chemotherapy. Other G -CSF analouges (including pegylated forms) may be used with adequate dosage adjustments. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 243 13.14.7.3 General considerations for supportive care Drug interactions Drugs which compromise renal function, e.g. aminoglycosides and non -steroid anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAID), can decrease cl earance of methotrexate and lead to systemic toxicity and should therefore be avoided during this phase. Methotrexate clearance is also hampered by proton -pump inhibitors, which should also be avoided. 13.14.7.4 Response evaluation For patients not in remission before the start of the block, a BM -examination should be performed 15 -20 days after the start of the block. The result of this BM - examination will guide the start of the next block as well as further HR -therapy and the timing of HSCT (see above). In case of aplasia without recovery of normal haematopoiesis at this time -point, weekly BM -examinations should follow until regeneration. For patients in clinical remission before the start of the block, the quality of the BM MRD -assessment is improved if count r ecovery is awaited. The administration of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) carries significant potential toxicity which in extreme cases can be fatal. This is prevented by effective folinic acid rescue. Absolute compliance with the schedule of hydration, monitoring of levels and folinic acid rescue is mandatory in this phase of the protocol. It is vital to rea d this section of the protocol before commencing administration of HDMTX . Please als o ensure that you have made certain that your patient has no contraindication to HDMTX. Please note that to be eligible for entry into this phase renal function should be within normal limits corrected for age. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 244 T-cell High Risk Block C BM examination will have been 15 -21 days after the start of HR -block B or after count recovery. A BM examination for assessment of MRD at the beginning of the block is recommended if the quality of the pr eceding BM examination was sub -optimal or if the start of the block had to be postponed for clinical reasons. Eligible patients: T-cell patients with high -risk stratification and inadequate response to preceding HR -therapy including block A and B . Therapy should aim for HSCT as soon as the MRD has reached an acceptable level and the general condition allows. The sequence of the blocks is A -B-C, but the first block that is shown to be effective in achieving an adequate MRD -level for HSCT may be repe ated if holding chemotherapy is necessary before HSCT for logistic reasons. For patients without acceptable donors, a shift to HR -chemotherapy analogous to high -risk BCP -patients is recommended. This block runs for approximately 3 weeks. Chemotherapy will be administered the first 7 days, supportive therapy with G -CSF continues until ANC recovery. 13.14.8.1 Starting criteria Patients with a high remaining leukaemic cell load must continue therapy as soon as possible and no haematological start -criteria apply. However, previous cardiotoxicity should be considered and may warrant echocardiography. In patients who have reached clinical remission, but have inadequate MRD -response for HSCT , block C can be started when: - ANC 0.5x109/L and - platelet count 80x109/L (and rising). The block should start no sooner than 3 weeks (21 days) from the start of the previous block. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 245 13.14.8.2 Antileukaemic therapy T -cell High Risk Block C Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy with single Mtx or ITT according to CNS -status at diagnosis and early response, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\" o n block day 1.

Therapy should aim for HSCT as soon as the MRD has reached an acceptable level and the general condition allows. For patients without acceptable donors, a shift to HR -chemotherapy analogous to the therapy for high-risk BCP -patients is recommended. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 246 13.15 Therapy for Down patients - therapy overview Summary From Table 14: Dosing of intrathecal single Methotrexate and intrathecal triple therapy (ITT) by age: Age 1 -<2 2-<3 3 Single Mtx dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Triple Intrathecal (ITT) dosing Mtx 8 mg 10 mg 12 mg Cytarabine 20 mg 25 mg 30 mg Alternative steroids in ITT Hydrocortisone Succinate* or 16 mg 20 mg 24 mg Prednisolone Sodium Succinate or 4 mg 5 mg 6 mg Methyl -Prednisolone Sodium Succinate 3.2 mg 4 mg 4.8 mg *Both the Hemisuccinate - and the Sodium succinate salt of Hydrocortisone can be used. In many countries, the preparations of steroids have no indication for intrathecal use and alternative preparations for other indications exist. It is therefore of utmost importance that only preparations without preservatives and without Benzyl alcohol are used. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 247 Down Standard Risk (SR) Consolidation 1 BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 29 (TP1) . Eligible patients: Down SR-patients, have no detectable MRD -signal day 29 and in addition: - no HR -genetics and - no CNS3 and - no TLP+ and - no IKZF1 -deletion . This phase runs for 6 weeks from day 29 (beginning of week 5) to day 70 inclusive (end of week 10). 13.15.2.1 Starting -criteria The patient should be in acceptable clinical condition with infectious complications under control before continued therapy day 36. Even in the case of complications during induction therapy, assessment day 29 is very important, since it is the basis for the stratification. VCR and IT Mtx-therapy on day 29 (for VCR alternatively day 30) are administered without considering peripheral blood counts - only the general condition of the patient. The platelet count should be adequate (refer to local/national guidelines) at the time of lumbar pun cture, but platelets may be transfused to achieve this. The PEG -Asp on day 32 and 46 are administered regardless of when 6MP doses are started. Before each administration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and no signs of pancreatitis, severe hepatic toxicity or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been instituted and the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy. 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP) is s tarted if: - WBC 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 248 13.15.2.2 Antileukaemic therap y Down Standard Risk Consolidation 1 Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone tapering during 7 -10 days from day 29. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on day 29. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2 day given orally days 36 -63 (in total 28 days). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should (PEG -Asp) Pegylated asparaginase (PEG -Asp) 1500 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on days 32 and 46. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20 000 IU/m2/dose every second day will be given IV (or IM) over one hour for a to tal of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp.

ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 253 Down Intermediate Risk Consolidation 1 BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 29 (TP1) . Eligible patients: - Down patients with detectable MRD (<5%) at TP1 and/or with IKZF1 deletion or - Down patients with HR -genetics or - Down patients with CNS3/TLP+ Such patients w ill be stratified to the Down IR-arm. This phase runs for 6 weeks from day 29 (beginning of week 5) to day 70 inclusive (end of wee k 10). 13.15.6.1 Starting -criteria The patient should be in acceptable clinical condition with infectious complications under control before continued therapy day 36. Even in the case of complications during induction therapy, assessment day 29 is very important, since it is the basis for the stratification. VCR and I T-therapy on day 29 (for VCR alternatively day 30) are administered without considering peripheral blood counts - only the general condition of the patient. The platelet count should be adequate (refer to loc al/national guidelines) at the time of lumbar puncture, but platelets may be transfused to achieve this. The PEG -Asp on day 32, 46 and 60 are administered regardless of when 6MP and the subsequent ARA -C doses start if the clinical condition allows it. Before each administration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and no signs of pancreatitis, severe hepatic toxicity or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate anticoagulation has been i nstituted and the patient is assessed as stable and fit for continued therapy. 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP), Cyclophosphamide (CPM) and IT therapy on day 36 is started if: - WBC is 1.5x109/L or - ANC 0.5 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L and rising. The starting criteria for the second cyclophosphamide day 50 (and the rest of the block) are - WBC 1.0x109/L or ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 254 - ANC 0.3 x109/L and - platelets 50x109/L. 13.15.6.2 Antileukaemic therapy Down IR- Consolidation 1 Dexamethasone (Dexa) Dexamethasone tapering during 7 -10 days from day 29. Vincristine (VCR) Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2 mg), IV push or as a short infusion (15 min) on day 29. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) 6-mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2 day given orall y days 36 -63 (in total 28 days). In patients with homozygous NUDT15 or TPMT -deficiency, the dose should 5 mg/m2. Cyclophosphamide (CPM) Cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 over 30 -60 min will be given on days 36 and 50. Hydration before and after cyclophosphamide according to national guidelines. Mesna before and after cyclophosphamide is optional and should be given according to national guidelines. Cytarabine (ARA -C) Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose IV push, given on -Asp) 1500 (dose for patients 16 years at diagnosis 1000 IU/m2) given IV (or IM) over one hour on days 32 and 46. In case of allergy or silent inactivation, Erwinia asparaginase at 20 000 IU/m2/dose every second day will be given IV over one hour for a total of 7 doses/dose of replaced PEG -Asp. Asparaginase activity monitoring (see 'TDM ASP guidel ines') is used to detect inactivation/distinguish between reactions with and without inactivation. Intrathecal therapy Intrathecal therapy, dosing by age according to Table 14, repeated under Post Induction Therapy \"Summary\", on days 29, 36 and 50 . 13.15.6.3 General considerations and supportive care Once started, the cytarabine blocks should be given without interruptions. If cytarabine has to be postponed or interrupted for clinical reasons, 6 -mercaptopurine should also be interrupted. Omitted 6 -mercaptopuri ne doses should be made up until the planned cumulative total dose of 1680 mg/m2 (28 x 60 mg/m2) is reached. Intrathecal therapy during Consolidation 1: Patients with CNS1 and TLP without leukaemic cells (TLP -) at diagnosis and patients with CNS2/TLP+ and low cell count at diagnosis, who have responded well to initial single Mtx continue with single Mtx. Patients with CNS2/TLP+ and slow response and pati ents with CNS3/TLP+ with 5 cells/microL CSF at diagnosis continue with ITT throughout therapy. Patients with remaining leukaemic cells in the CSF day 29 continue with weekly ITTs until CSF is clear in 2 consecutive samples (CNS -remission) - possible extra doses days 43, 57 and 64. Patients with remaining ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 255 leukaemic contamination of the CSF at the end of Consolidation 1 have Protocol Therapy Failure (primary event in the EFS analysis). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 256 High Risk Consolidation 1 (Augmented BFM) (Down patients) BM examination for stratification will be performed on day 29 (TP1) Eligible patients: All Down patients with MRD ( 5%) at TP1 will be stratified to the Down HR -arm. Even in the case of complications during induction therapy, assessment day 29 is very important, since it is the basis for the stratification. At the beginning of the block, the high MR D-value at day 29 is not known. Therefore, the treatment in week 5 is identical between the Down IR - and the Down HR -arms. This phase runs for 11 weeks from day 29 (beginning of week 5) to day 105 inclusive (end of week 15). 13.15.7.1 Starting -criteria VCR and I T-therapy on day 29 (for VCR alternatively day 30) are administered without considering peripheral blood counts - only the general condition of the patient. The platelet count should be adequate (refer to local/national guidelines) at the time of lumbar pu ncture, but platelets may be transfused to achieve this. The PEG -Asp on day 32, 46, 60, 74, 88 and 102 are administered regardless of when 6MP and the subsequent ARA -C doses start if the clinical condition allows it. Before each administration of PEG -Asp there should be a clinical assessment and no signs of pancreatitis, severe hepatic toxicity or thrombosis. However, PEG -Asp therapy may be continued after a previous thrombotic event if adequate ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 257 anticoagulation has been instituted and the patient is assess ed as stable and fit for continued therapy. Patients with a high remaining leukaemic cell load after induction ( 5%) must continue therapy as soon as possible. When the high MRD -value at day 29 has been confirmed 6 -Mercaptopurine (6MP), Cyclophosphamide (CPM) and ITT on day 36 is started, regardless of peripheral blood counts, when the general condition allows it. Once Consolidation 1 is started and the patient h ad an MRD of 5% at day 29, the first part of the block (weeks 5 -9) should be completed irrespective of blood counts. There are no starting -criteria for the Cytarabine -blocks in this situation. Only serious clinical conditions, such as uncontrolled infecti on may interrupt therapy and such interruptions are based on individual clinical assessments. Treatment should restart when signs of infection have abated. A second BM -examination will be performed at the beginning of week 9 (day 57). If this evaluation shows no response (equal or increasing fraction of leukaemic cells), the patient is considered resistant to protocol therapy - \"protocol therapy failure\" , goes off protocol and is available for alternative interventions. If the evaluation week 9 shows at least some degree of response, the second part of the block (from week 10 -15) is administered. If the MRD is still 5%, therapy continues on day 64 (beginning of week 10) irrespective of peripheral blood counts, when the general condiation allows it. If the evaluation week 9 shows adequate response with MRD <5% the therapy week 10 starts if: - the ANC is 0.75x109/L and - platelets are 75x109/L. A bone -marrow examination to evaluate the response to Consolidation 1 is scheduled for day 99. If the second part of Consolidation 1 (from week 10) started irrespective of peripheral counts because of MRD 5% week 9, this bone -marrow should take place irrespective of peripheral counts. If the day 57 bone -marrow evaluation showed MRD <5% and counts were awaited for the start of the second part week 10, the bone -marrow should await peripheral count recovery: (ANC 0.75x109/L and platelets 75x109/L). All patients receive a week of holding chemotherapy with mercaptopurine at 25mg/m2/day from day 99 -105 (i.e. week 15) whilst awaiting the post -consolidation MRD result. If BM MRD is 0.01 % consider entry into CAR -T study.

Approximately 10 -15% of patients are able to escalate the methotrexate dose to the maximum of 300mg/m2. About 30 -40% are able to make some escalation. The major toxicity is likely to be mucositis. The full toxicity grading is included in the section on toxicity assessment and reporting. Start Capizzi at a methotrexate dose of 100mg/m2. Increase the dose for each subseq uent dose by 50mg/m2, as tolerated, to a maximum dose of 300mg/m2. Prior to each dose patient should be assessed for 1) oral, 2) haematological, 3) hepatic and 4) renal toxicity, and the dosage modified as outlined below. Doses of Vincristine and PEG -asparaginase should only be omitted for serious intercurrent illness. 1) Oral toxicity: for grade 2 mucositis of over 3 days duration, decrease intravenous MTX dose by 30% to 70% of previous dose then escalate each subsequent dose by 50mg/m2, as tolerat ed. For grade 3 -4, mucositis, withhold intravenous MTX until resolved; resume at 50% of the previously attained dose and subsequently escalate to 75% then to 100% dose at 10 day intervals provided grade 3 -4 toxicity does not recur. Consider culturing lesio ns if ANC<0.75x109/L or platelets <75x109/L; it should be reinstituted on the first due date following the omitted dose when ANC 0.75x109/L and platelets 75x109/L, and the dosage should be decreased to 80% of the previously administered dose. Escalate each subsequent dose by 50mg/m2, as tolerated. Missed doses will not be made up.

NB! The time -frame for IR -patients and HR -patients will be different, which is noted in the schematics and the therapy details. Maintenance runs in 4-week cycles starting at the beginning of week 26 (IR); week 31 (HR) and continuing until exactly 2 years from the start of consolidation 1. Once maintenance is started the clock does not stop regardless of whether treatment is given or not. Only Mercaptop urine and oral Methotrexate will be interrupted for myelosuppression and the time is not be made up. Days off therapy for intercurrent infections are counted as days of maintenance and thus no compensation is made for interruptions in treatment. 13.15.11.1 Starting c riteria Maintenance is started when - ANC 0.75x109/L and - platelets 75x109/L. 13.15.11.2 Antileukaemic therapy Down IR/HR Standard Maintenance 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP) 6-mercaptopurine, initial dose 75 mg/m2/day orally up to 2 years from complete remission (25 months, 108 weeks).

Investigational Medicinal Products for the ALLTogether1 sub - protocols: IMP Dosing Route of adm Treatment phases Reference source Randomisation 1 Doxorubicin 30 mg/m2/dose IV DI succinate succinate succinate (<25 yrs) - d29 throughout treatment (25 yrs) SmPC All investigational medicinal products except for Inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa\u00ae) are considered IMPs that are administered as in standard of care (SOC). Randomisation 1: in this randomisation standard risk patients are randomised to receive treatment with or without Doxorubicin in the Delayed Intensification phase. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 269 The comparator IMP is the Doxorubicin given in the standard arm, which is removed in the experimental arm. Randomisation 2: in this randomisation intermediate risk -low patients are randomised to receive: The standard arm (with Doxorubicin in the Delayed Intensification phase and with Vincristine -Dexamethasone pulses in the Maintenance phase). Experimental arm A (without Doxorubicin in the DI phase and with VCR -Dexa pulses in the Maintenance phase). Experimental arm B (with Doxorubicin in the DI phase and without VCR -Dexa pulses in the Maintenance phase). The comparator IMPs are Doxorubicin, Vincristine and Dexamethasone, which are omitted in the experi mental arms. Randomisation 3: in this randomisation intermediate risk -high patients (with some exceptions) are randomised to receive: The standard arm (No IMPs). Experimental arm InO: addition of two 3 -week courses of Inotuzumab (6 weeks in total). This i s followed by maintenance therapy similar to the standard arm. The test IMPs are Inotuzumab and the drugs in the standard sodium succinate. All drugs in the experimental InO arm - standard maintenance post Ino, are interpreted as IMPs because all drugs in one treatment arm are considered related to each other rather than isolated drugs. Due to the 6 weeks of Inotuzumab before start of maintenance, the start and stop time for these SOC IMPs differ compared to the standard arm. The time period for the experimental Inotuzumab -arm is from first treatm ent of Inotuzumab until end of treatment. ABL-class fusions intervention: In this intervention patients who carry than BCR -ABL1 ) in their of a tyrosine -kinase inhibitor, Imatinib, which is the test IMP administered at the same dose and manner as for patients with BCR -ABL1 . IMPs that are also drugs used in standard of care The Investigat ional Imatinib; are identified only by ac tive substance and will be sourced locally from the market of each participating country. The pharmacies will use marketed products according to local preferences based on the active substance. These IMPs all have marketing authorisation s and the products are standard of care (SOC) drugs for ALL and will not be provided by the Sponsor. Because they are SOC -drugs, neither the quality of the study, nor patient safety will be enhanced by specific labelling of these drugs and, whenever possibl e, exemption from demand for study -specific labelling will be applied for. No drug accountability will be performed on IMPs that are considered as standard of care (SOC). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 270 The SmPCs for these IMPs have been selected based on the most appropriate SmPC with reference to subject safety and availability in the participating countries. The most recent EU SmPCs have been used where available, i.e. for Dexamethasone, Imatinib and 6 -mercaptopurine. The steroid available for intrathecal administration in combinati on with cytarabine and methotrexate (intrathecal triple therapy, ITT), varies among the participating countries. For this purpose , Prednisolone sodium succinate / Methylprednisolone sodium succinate / Hydrocortisone succinate (both the hemisuccinate - and the sodium succinate salt of Hydrocortisone) can be used in the study protocol. In several countries, the preparations of steroids have no indication for intrathecal use and alternative preparations for other indications exist. It is therefore of utm ost importance that only preparations without preservatives and without Benzyl alcohol are used. Steroids administered intrathecal ly have been given to patients for the last 10 -15 years for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and is considered standard of care. For Besponsa\u00ae (Inotuzumab ozogam icin), the commercial stock of Besponsa\u00ae will be used and provided for free by the Sponsor. The current EU SmPC is used for reference. Relabelling of Besponsa\u00ae (Inotuzumab ozogami cin) will be performed by CSM Clinical Supplies Management Europe. For guidelines for administration, see protocol section 'Treatment details'.

ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 277 16. STUDY TERMINATION AN D WITHDRAWALS 16.1 Patient Follow Up After completion of maintenance therapy, patients will be followed at least annually for a period of five years from the end of Induction. Patients in R1 and R2 are followed for a minimum of five years from the time of randomisation . If a patient fails to attend the clinic for any visit, the center must make every effort to pursue adequate follow -up information. R3 - InO follow -up is described in the R3 - InO protocol. 16.2 Patient Withdrawal Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do so without any consequences to their clinical management. The investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons (safety or compliance). The re ason for withdrawal from ALLTogether1 protocol treatment should be recorded in the patient's medical records and in the CRF. Patients/parents/legal guardians may withdraw consent at any time during the study . The details of the withdrawal should be clearl y documented in the medical record and in the CRF: The date the patient or their parent(s)/legal guardian withdrew consent. The reason, if given (e.g. toxicity to drug) and in the electronic case report form (eCRF) whether the withdrawals were based on the patient's/parents'/legal guardian's or the clinician's decision. Reason for withdrawal may include, but are not limited to: The patient/parent (s)/legal guardian (s) withdraw (s) consent to further treatment within the study * Unacceptable toxicity Protocol Therapy Failure Relapse Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Inclusion in a CAR -T trial Non-compliance with protocol regimens and procedures Investigator determination Female patient planning pregnancy, bec omes pregnant or be gins breast - feeding Non-compliance with procedures to collect important safety and survival follow -up data. *Even if consent for treatment within the study is withdrawn, the patient will still have to receive standard of care therapy, unless the patient is a legally competent adult, who has the right to decline treatment. All such patients leaving the study befo re time are recommended to be treated according to the standard arms of the ALLTogether1 protocol. All patients withdrawn from study treatment will remain within the study unless the patient/parents/legal guardians explicitly withdraw consent for data coll ection. All data, including data from patients leaving randomised trials, will be included in the intention -to-treat analysis until the date of withdrawal from data collection. Follow -up of subjects withdrawn from treatment ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 278 If a patient expresses an inter est in withdrawing from the study the Investigator should: Request that the patient returns for a fin al visit to perform applicable investigations and sampling for this visit (end of study), if applicable Follow up with the patient regarding any unresolved serious adverse events 16.3 Withdrawal of consent to data collection Patient's/parents'/legal guardians' wishes with respect to their data must be respected. If a patient explicitly states that they do not wish for any further data to be collected this must be recorded on the relevant CRF. This information should also be recorded in the patient's medical records and no further CRFs must be completed. 16.4 Replacement of individual patient after withdrawal Patients will not be replaced after withdrawal. 16.5 Lost to follow -up If a patient is lost to follow -up, every effort should be made to contact the patient to obtain information on the patient's status. Similarly, if a patient's care is transferred to another physician, the ALLTogether Central Office should be info rmed, so that follow - up can be arranged with the receiving physician if this person is an investigator in the study. 16.6 Premature termination of the study The ALLTogether Consortium steering committee may terminate this study prematurely, either the entire study , therapy for one or more of the risk -groups or one or more of the randomised parts if there is reasonable cause to do so. This decision may be the result of advice from the DSMB, concerns raised in annual safety and progress reports or for other unfo reseen reasons. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 279 17. SAFETY 17.1 Safety registration in the Master protocol Introduction/Background The multi -agent chemotherapy needed for cure of a high fraction of patients is associated with severe expected toxicity. Because of the complexity of the therapy, with the sequential use of many different chemotherapeutic agents as well as risky procedures such as allogeneic stem -cell transplantation, the range of this expected toxicity is very extensive. Adverse Events and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) The definition of an Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with t his treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), sym ptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. Because of th e extensive expected toxicity, full reporting of adverse events according to stan dard guidelines is of limited value when evaluating toxicity in an ALL study. The volume would be practically prohibitive, but would also risk becoming less informative due to differences in interpretation and resources for reporting locally. Since the ex pected toxicity in ALL with potentially serious consequences as a result of standard chemotherapy are well known and recent work has resulted in international consensus on how to grade and interpret a number of these items, we intend to systematically f ollow up 19 of these (Table 21) as \"Adverse Events of Special Interest\" (AESI) if they fulfil pre -specified grading criteria according to Schmiegelow et al. Lancet Oncology, 2016 [37] and/or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 or some additional specific criteria. By clearly linking these toxicities to phases of therapy and also recording negative findings, a credible assessment of the incidence of these complications in relation to the protocol treatment will be obtained. In addition, we will be able to follow thes e toxicities over time to understand what toxicities and what fraction of these toxicities are likely to lead to problems in the long run. Since all of these toxicities are expected and since we aim to capture them fully in CRFs, they will be exempt from expedited reporting according to the rules of SAEs (see below) except in the case of death not attributable to progressive disease or relapse (by definition treatment -related mortality - see separate definition). Since these toxicities are expected they a re also by definition not SUSARs (see below). The time -points for assessment of the AESI are illustrated by risk -group in Figures 15-21. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose: is fatal or life -threatening* ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 280 requires prolonged hospitalization results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect is medically significant, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. *Life- threatening events are defined as: circulatory/cardiac insufficiency requiring catecholamines/positive inotropes respiratory failure requiring intubation/ventilation other clinical situations requiring immediate intervention, e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation requiring surger y cerebral abscess/bleeding requiring immediate neurosurgical intervention. The main rule is that SAEs must be reported to the study management within 24 hours and documented. A specific e -CRF form for SAE -reporting should be used in ALLTogether. There will be three types of exceptions to this rule. An AE fulfilling the SAE -criteria will not be reported on an SAE -form if: it falls into the category mentioned above of AESI reported fo r all patients (listed in table 21). it falls into a category of specific toxicities captured in connection with the randomised parts of R1 and R2 (Table 22). (NB! Specific rules apply to toxicity -reporting in R3 - InO-- see below and separate sub -protocols ). It falls into a category of excee dingly common expected toxicities for which there is no specific interest in the protocol evaluation, listed under Exception rules for SAE -reporting below. This means that for the majority of the protocol, SAE -reporting within 24 hours is limited to toxic ities fulfilling the SAE -criteria but not fulfilling the criteria for AESI/randomised reporting and not being listed as exempt from expedited SAE - reporting. NB! All deaths not obviously resulting from recurrent or progressive ALL (mostly treatment -related mortality - TRM) should always be reported within 24 hours. Exception rules for SAE reporting As mentioned above, it is not necessary to report SAEs that only require hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, because the intensity of the therapy will lead to too many SAEs by this definition. The following anticipated adverse events are excluded from the SAE reporting requirements. But many of these are also included in the AESI -list and need to be reported as AESIs in due course. Hospitalisation for parenteral nutrition or iv rehydration due to - mucositis, - chemotherapy -induced anorexia of vomiting - diarrhea Slow MTX elimination with or without impaired kidney -function Febrile neutropenia with the need for inpatient anti biotic therapy Infection without neutropenia requiring in -patient antibiotic therapy Allergic reactions ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 281 Vincristine neuropathy Rash Diarrhoea Impaired pancreatic function, pancreatitis or elevated pancreatic enzymes Impaired liver -function or elevated liver enzymes Renal insufficiency Hospitalizations planned before entry into the clinical study Elective treatm ent of a pre -existing condition SUSAR A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is any suspected adverse reaction related to the study treatment that is both serious and unexpected. \"Unexpected\" means that the nature and severity of the adverse reaction are not consistent with the information about the study medication set out in the respective reference documents (investigator's brochure and/or available summary of product characteristics concerning all other applied drugs in this protocol). All SAEs which are assessed as SUSARs will be reported in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries . Pregnancy If a pregnancy occurs, a Pregnancy Report Form should be completed by investigator and reported to sponsor. Should a birth defect occur, it is reported as an SAE (see above). Reporting of Other Adverse Events (AEs) generally Apart from the toxicities specified above, no adverse events will be reported generally in the protocol. Exceptions to this statement apply within the R3 - InO randomised sub -study - see section Study Assessments above and separate compilations (included i n the R3 - InOprotocol ). 17.2 Safety registration in R1 and R2 To evaluate the potentially positive effect of the reduction of therapy, an additional set of toxicity -variables will be recorded for the randomised parts of therapy in R1 and R2 (Table 22). The time -points for collection of specific toxicity data for the R1 and R2 randomisations will be coordinated with the AESI -collections. These time -points are illustrated by risk -group and randomisation in Figures 15 -21. Even though these toxicities per se fulfil the general criteria for SAE -reporting, they will be exempt from reporting within 24 hours on SAE -forms, but will be collected in e-CRFs as outlined above.

Information on AESIs will be collected on follow -up forms until the end of follow -up within the study. One additional item (BMI) is reported 5 years after cessation of therapy for patients included in the R1 and R2 randomisations. 17.6.1.2 Serious Adverse Events AEs defined as serious and which require reporting as an SAE (excluding events exceptions of SAE and A E fulfilling criteria as AESI) should be reported on an SAE Form. When completing the form, the Investigator will be asked to define the causality and the severity of the AE which should be documented . On becoming aware that a patient has experienced an SAE, the Investigator (or delegate) must complete, date and sign an SAE Form (either in the eCRF -system or, if this should fail for any reason, on paper within 24 hours. Important relevant information no t known at the outset should be provided on a SAE Follow up Form. SAEs should be reported until 30 days after the end of treatment. However, note the special requirements for patients included in the R3 - InO randomisation. For more detailed instructions on SAE reporting, refer to the SAE Form Completion Guidelines in the Investigator Site File (ISF). 17.6.1.3 Provision of follow -up information AESIs will be followed up in the eCRF of the subsequent phase(s) and in annual follow -up until the final AESI report at the end of the study. SAEs will be followed until resolution or stabilisation of the event (or until final reporting 30 days after cessation of therapy). Safety reporting from sponsor On receipt of an SAE Form seriousness and causality will be determined independently by the Chief Investigator or designee. An SAE judged by the Investigator or Chief Investigator/designee to have a reasonable causal relationship with the study medication will be regarded as a Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR). If the event meets the definition of a SAR that is unexpected (i.e. is not defined in the ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 292 Summary of Product Characteristics) it will be classified as a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SU SAR). The sponsor will promptly forward via e -mail the SUSAR to the National Principle Investigator and/or Clinical Trial Unit where the SUSAR occurred. The applicable country will report the SUSAR to the National Compent Authorities and web portal Eudrav igilance. In addition, the sponsor will promptly notify all NPIs/CTUs about a SUSAR. The sponsor has to report the SUSAR promptly to the NPIs/CTUs to enable the country to comply with the regulatory requirements and timelines for SUSAR reporting. The time lines to report the SUSAR are seven days of first knowledge of the SUSAR that result in death or are life threatening followed by a period of maximum of eight days to complete the initial preliminary report. All other SUSARS will be reported within a perio d of maximum 15 days after the sponsor has first knowledge of the SUSAR. Developmental safety update report (DSUR) The sponsor will submit, once a year throughout the clinical study, a safety report to the NPI/CTU in the participating countries to enable them to report the DSUR to the accredited IRB/EC, competent authorities of the concerned Member States. A copy of the DSUR will be sent to Pfizer concerning the Inotuzumab -randomisation. This safety report consists of: A list of all suspected (unexpected o r expected) serious adverse reactions, along with an aggregated summary table of all reported serious adverse reactions, ordered by organ system. A compilation of AESIs for the whole patient -population and the pooled patient -populations for the risk -group s and for the randomised studies. A report concerning the safety of the subjects, consisting of a complete safety analysis and an evaluation of the balance between the efficacy and the harmfulness of the interventions under investigation. The data in the annual safety -report is aggregated without specification of randomised arms . DSMB (reference to the appendix DSMB -charter) A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is an independent group of experts that advises the sponsor and the study investigators. The task of the DSMB is to evaluate research data on an ongoing basis to assure participant safety and study integrity. The DSMB periodically (at least annually) reviews safety and study data and makes recommendations based on their review along with asses sing the performance of overall study operations and any other relevant issues, as necessary. The basis for the review is a report provided by the study -statistician without the knowledge or influence by the Sponsor, Principal Investigator or Steering comm ittee. The data in this report is compiled both for the entire population, per risk -group, per randomisation and finally unblinded with regard to randomised arms. The advice of the DSMB will be sent to the sponsor of the study to be shared with the steerin g committee. Should the sponsor decide not to fully implement the advice of the DSMB, the sponsor will send the advice to the reviewing accredited competent authorities, including a note to substantiate why (a part of) the advice of the DSMB will not be fo llowed. The DSMB charter (separate document) provides information on duties of the DSMB. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 293 17.7 Contraception The study protocol refer to the guidance document Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG): Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials https://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01 - About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/2014_09_HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf . Definition of women of childbearing potential and fertile men For the purpos e of this study protocol , a women is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post - menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectom y and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in w omen not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. For the purpose of this study protocol, a man is considered fertile after puberty unless per manently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy. Contraception and pregnancy testing recommendations The chemotherapy given in the study protocol can cause human embryotoxicity, teratogenicity and fetotoxicity. The inclusion of WOCBP requires use of a highly effective contraceptive measure (Pearl index <1), if no medical contraindication is present. T.he choice of contraceptive method for WOBCP may need to be adapted due to special circumstances during the treatment due to possible interactions, risk for thro mbosis, liver - and other toxicitiesy as well as nd infections that vary ies in different parts of the protocol and with the status of the disease. A combination of two acceptable birth control methods (as listed under 17.7.2.2) could be acceptable under th ese special circumstances. In the case of potential interaction between the treatment and a highly effective hormonal contraception, the hormonal contraception should be complemented by a barrier method. The study protocol will include adolescents, sexual and contraceptive counselling will should be provided during the treatment for this patient group. Additional pregnancy testing should be performed is recommended at monthly intervals for WOCBP in the master protocol and is required monthly during R3- InO treatment. The above mentioned measures should be maintained during treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure (for 30 days (WOBCP) and 90 days (fertile men) respectively after the last treatment dosage in master protocol and/or 8 mo nths (WOBCP) and 5 months (fertile men) after the last InO dosage, the last time point is to be chosen. 17.7.2.1 Birth control methods which may be considered as highly effective Methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consisten tly and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods. This includes: ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 294 Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition o hormonal associated Oral o Injectable o Implantable2 Intrauterine contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method. 2 Contraception methods that in the context of this protocol are considered to have low user dependency. 3Vasectomised partner is highl y effective birth control method provided that the partner is sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. 4In the context of this guidance sexual abstinence i s considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 17.7.2.2 Acceptable birth control methods which may not be considered as highly effective Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per year include: progestogen -only hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action male or female condom with or without spermicide5 cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide5 5A combination of male condom with either ca p, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods. 17.7.2.3 Recommendations for male subjects with pregnant or non - pregnant WOCBP partner The male subject should use male contraception (condom) during treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure in the male subject. For a non -pregnant WOCBP partner, contraception recommendations should also be considered. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 295 18. DATA CAPTURE AND RECO RD KEEPING 18.1 Data Capture Clinical outcomes, leukemi a specific adverse events as well as adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be recorded and captured in an electronic case reports forms (eCRFs) after each phase of therapy. There will also be an indication that the therapy during the phase was administered a ccording to protocol or modified and the reason for modification. A small fraction of patients experiences so severe toxicity that the subsequent therapy must be radically changed. Such cases will also be recorded in the phase -specific eCRFs. The eCRF is based on modules to complete after each treatment phase and additional modules for safety registrations . The Baseline Characteristics module is designed to summarize important attributes of the participants enrolled at the start of the study. Demography Diagnos tics and date of diagnosis at a paediatric oncology/adult haematology centre. Clinical and genetic data Data to be registered into the eCRF is corresponding to primary and secondary endpoints as well as the safety reporting throughout the study. eCRF All relevant data collected during the study for all of the patients enrolled into the study have to be entered into the eCRF system by the responsible Local Principal Investigator at the centre or a designee (authorized by the LPI) in a timely manner. The LPI will review all the eCRF's of each patient and confirm the completeness and medical correctness of the documented data. Edit checks programmed into the software will make sure data meets certain required formats, ranges, etc. before the data is acc epted into the study database. Field monitors, data managers or the study statistician will review data according to Monitoring Plan and Data Management Plan. Queries that are sent to the centres require response and confirmation or correction of the data by authorized staff at the centre. The Data Management Plan ( separate document ) provides detailed information about data collection and data management throughout the study. This includes but is not limited to Data management and includes all processes and procedures for collecting, handling, manipulating, analyzing, and storing/archiving of data from study start to completion. 18.2 Record keeping Essential Documents are those documents which individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced. These documents serve to demonstrate the compliance of the investigator, sponsor and monitor with the standards of Good Clinical Practice and with all applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor and center should maintain a record (source documentation list) of the location(s) of their respective essential documents including source documents. Source documentation is all information in original records and certified copies of original records or clinical find ings, observations, or other activities in a clinical study necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study . Source documents are ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 296 generated as part of the subject's medical care and therefore normally documented and archived in medical records and records of other service departments. The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study. The investigator must also ensure that the subject's confidentiality is maintained for documents submitted to the sponsor. Subjects a re to be identified by a unique study subject identification number , initials and date of birth. The investigator gains access to the electronic case report forms (eCRF) for documentation. All information in the eCRF must be traceable in the source documents of the patient. The investigator/institution should have control of all essential documents a nd records generated by the investigator/institution before, during, and after the study . All study documentation has to be filed and a Trial Master File (TMF) is established in the beginning of the study , both at the investigator/centre level and with the sponsor. As specified in GCP, the sponsor as well as the investigator / centre should maintain essential study documents in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 297 19. QUALITY MANAGEMENT 19.1 Monitoring and quality assurance The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal requirements, and generally accepted quality assurance and quality control procedures in the GCP guidelines. To obtain the necessary documentation and monitoring, the sponsor will establish an agreement with the National Principal Investigator (NPI) or the National Clinical Trial Unit (NCTU) to perform the monitoring throughout the entire study. The NPIs and/or the NCTUs are responsible for ensuring that each participating center within a country will have the expertise and procedures to meet any emergency occurring during the study. All centres will be required to sign a Clinical Study Center Agreement prior to participation. In addition, all participating Investigators will be asked to sign the necessary agreements and supply a current CV to the N P I o r N C T U . All members of the centre's research team will also be required to sign a Delegation Log. Prior to commencing recruitment all centers will undergo a process of initiation. Key members of the research team at the centre will be required to attend either a meeting or a teleconference covering aspects of the study design, protocol procedures, safety reporting, collection and reporting of data and record keeping. Centres will be provided with an Investigator Site File containing essential documentation, instructions, and other documentation required for the conduct of the study . The NPI/NCTU and Trial Central Office must be informed immediately of any change in the research team at the centre. The level of monitoring for each centre is risk -based and the focus is on critical study data and processes. This approach relies on a combination of On -site-, Remote - and Centralized monitoring. Appropriate actions will be taken if lacking compliance to protocol, processes or GCP, other misconduct or major issues are discovered at a centre and monitoring activities may be intensified as a response. The level of monitoring chosen for each part of the study is also based upon a range of factors to be consid ered, e.g. phase (screening or follow up), Study Design complexity (standard of care or intervention), relative safety of the investigational product etc. On-site/center Monitoring Representatives of the sponsor and/or NPI/NCTU, Field Monitors (FMs) must be allowed to visit all study centre locations periodically to assess the data, quality and study integrity. On center they will review study records and directly compare them with s ource documents (Source Data Verification, SDV) and discuss the conduct of the study with the Principle Investigator and verify that the facilities remain acceptable. Source documents are defined as patient files, letters, laboratory records, x -ray reports etc. The frequency and scope of monitoring is defined in the Monitoring Plan . The principal investigator at the centre is obligated to support the activities of the field monitors, provide them with direct access to the files and give them the opportunity to inspect the laboratory facilities, storage of th e investigational product, etc. Remote Monitoring Remote data review may be used by the field monitor to ensure consistency, plausibility and correctness of the data in -between the On -site monitoring visi ts and to prepare for monitoring visit (On Site) or to assist with data query resolution. Remote monitoring does not include SDV. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 298 Central Monitoring Centralized monitoring is a remote evaluation carried out by sponsor personnel or representatives (e.g., Data management personnel) Centralized monitoring is a remote, real -time monitoring and quality review. Specific review parameters to be centrally monitored for this study are documented in the Data Management Plan. Observations identified during data rev iew will be shared with FM and the Project Manager at the CTU on a regular basis. Discrepancies related to patient data will be raised directly as queries in the eCRF system by the Data management personnel . The Data management personnel will alert centre FM to discuss if a center needs intensified monitoring activities due to non -compliance to protocol or other procedures. Specified information about monitoring processes of the critical study data an d processes is documented in a Data Management Plan. Protocol Deviations A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures defined in the protocol. The non -compliance may be either on the part of the study subjects, the investigator, or the staff at the centre in qu estion. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the center and implemented promptly. Major Protocol deviation not captured in the eCRF that may significantly impact the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject's rights, safety, or well -being has to be reported to the sponsor wi thin 7 calendar days. Minor Protocol deviations not captured in the eCRF must be documented in the monitoring visits report. All Protocol deviations may be accompanied with a Note to File where this of a clarifying value and filed in the Trial Master File /Investigator Site File. Major Protocol deviations not captured in the eCRF should be logged in a cumulative tracking sheet that is saved by the FM between monitoring visits and reported to the Trial Manager and the Chief Investigator . This will aid decis ion making at the time of data analysis and interpretation and can help to spot protocol deviation trends. 19.2 Amendments Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the Chief Investigator, the Steering Committee and the sponsor. Amendments to the study are regarded as 'substantial' if they are likely to have a significant impact on: The safety or physical or mental integrity of study subjects The conduct or management of the study The scientific value of the study The quality or safety of any Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) used in the study. It is the sponsor's responsibility to decide whether an amendment is substantial or non-substantial. The sponsor of a study can make amendments at any time but when an amendment is considered substantial, the clinical trial unit in each country is required to submit the substantial amendment to the Ethical Review Board, and if applicable, also National regulatory authority, bef ore implementation. National requirements must be followed. Notwithstanding, the need for approval of formal protocol amendment, all investigators are expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any patient included in this study, eve n if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 299 20. END OF STUDY DEFINITIONS The ALLTogether Protocol has the character of a master protocol including sub - protocols and sub -studies, with some of the modular elements having different time - frames than the whole trial. The R3 - InO randomisation has a planned duration of 5 years recruitment and 2 years follow -up for the last included patient until the study should be analysed and repor ted. This part of the trial will thus close for new inclusions after 5 years (or when the target population has been recruited) and will close for final analyses two years later. The R1 and R2 randomisations have a planned duration of 6 years of recruitme nt and another 5 years follow -up for the last included patient until the study should be analysed and reported. This part of the trial will thus close for new inclusions after 6 years (or when the target population has been recruited) and will close for fi nal analyses five years later. The master protocol will remain open until all the randomised parts have closed, which according to what has been said above will coincide with the closing of the R1 and R2 randomisations. The end of the study will be the da te of the last visit of the last participant. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 300 21. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AND POWER CALCULATIONS ALLTOGE THER The ALLTogether protocol include three randomised study -questions, two of which aim to reduce toxicity in low -risk populations by de -escalation of post -induction therapy whilst maintaining leukaemia -specific a non -inferiority design: R1 randomises SR -patients to without anthracycline R2 randomises IR -low patients to either remove antracycline in delayed intensification or Vincristine -Dexamethasone pulses in the maintenance phase. The non -inferiority margin has been chosen as a clinically acceptable deterioration of the disease -free survival (DFS), bearing in mind that, based on our historical data, additional relapses in these risk -groups would be predominantly late and highly salvageable with second -line therapy. We have chosen to accept the same deterioration in percentage points of DFS as the safety margin for these, accepting that target populations will differ slightly between the groups. However, it is important to realise that in the historic data, the risk -groups have almost identic al outcomes, but with slightly different therapy. Furthermore, they will not have received the same therapy until the point of randomisation, which makes us conclude that the populations are not identical. One study -question target s a population with high er risk of relapse, the IR -high group in an intervention aiming to improve disease -free survival by reducing the risk of relapse in a comparative design. The randomised addition of a new agent, Inotuzumab, before the maintenance phase (R3 - InO). 21.1 Sample size calculations The study is powered for three randomised comparisons. All power calculations were performed using simulations (in STATA) and historical data sets that should be equivalent to each control arm (taken from NOPHO ALL -2008, DCOG10/1 1, COALL -03/09 and UKALL 2003). Varying lengths of recruitment time (i.e. sample size) were considered. For each of 5,000 simulations, a sample of time -to-event observations was randomly generated from a survival function obtained from the historical data available. Non-inferiority calculations (R1 and R2) Treatment arms were randomly assigned. Censoring was applied in line with the expected recruitment pattern for ALLtogether. Cox regression analyses were performed with non -inferiority established if the 95% confidence interval of the experimental arm (or either of the experimental arms for the three -group comparison) was below the specified margin. The power was calculated as the proportion of these 5,000 simulations where non -inferiority was shown. The r ecruitment time was chosen as the minimum number of years required to achieve a power of 80% or more for all randomisations. Both non -inferiority comparisons assume that the Disease Free Survival rates in the experimental arm is the same as the control a rm. The non -inferiority limits for this study are equal or similar to the limits used in previous studies in ALL with similar questions (AIEOP Sep 2020 301 Superiority calculation (R3 - InO) The survival function in the experimental arm was calculated from that in the control arm by assuming proportional hazards for different hazard ratios. Censoring was applied in line with the expected recruitment pattern for ALLtogether. Cox regression analyses were performed with superiority established if the confidence interval for the hazard ratio did not include 1. The power was calculated as the proportion of these 5,000 si mulations where superiority was shown. The number of years recruitment was chosen as the minimum number required to achieve a power of 80% or more. 21.2 Randomisation 1 (R1) Removal of anthracyclines from the delayed intensification block for patients treated according to the Very Low Risk group of the ALLTogether -1 protocol (<16s only). The primary endpoint of this randomisation is Disease Free Survival (DFS). This is a non-inferiority comparison where we aim to show that removing anthracyclines does not result in an unacceptable reduction in the DFS rate. Removing anthracyclines will be considered non -inferior if the lower limit of a one -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference of the pDFS at 5 years is below 5% (non -inferiority range 5%). Given a baseline pDFS of 0.95 this translates to a non -inferiority margin for the hazard rat io of 2.05. 842 randomised patients followed up for minimum 5 years, corresponding to an estimated number of 45 adverse events in the DFS -analysis, would be appropriate to assess non -inferiority of reduced anthracyclines as compared to standard anthracycli ne with 80% power. Over a period of 5 years we expect to be able to recruit 5865 patients <16 years into this protocol (926 in year 1, 1021 in year 2 and 1306 thereafter). About 23% of these patients are eligible for this randomisation. If we assume a rat e of 70% of patients who accept the randomisation and are treated according to the randomised arm we expect 932 randomised per -protocol patients. The required number of patients will be reached. Randomisation will be 1:1 using minimisation stratified by country, sex, NCI -risk group (SR: 3 -drug induction, HR: 4 hyperdiploidy, B -other). Recruitment into R1 will be discontinued after 842 patients have been randomised and found to be evaluable. Since power has been calculated for a five -year recruitment time and a minimum of five years follow -up time for the last recruited patient, the follow -up time will be extended if the recruitment time is significantly shorter than five years. The premise of the study is t hat anthracyclines are toxic to the heart and, even at relatively low doses, is associated with an increased risk of future cardiac disease. It is acknowledged that this benefit will be difficult to ascertain within the time -frame of the study, but acute c ardiac toxicity will be measured. However, the use of anthracycline in the context of the therapy -element delayed intensification has also been associated with other types of toxicity (predominantly bone -marrow suppression, mucosal damage with abdominal c omplications and resulting serious infections). For that reason, a number of secondary end -points associated with this risk will be measured, such as incidence of serious infections as well as days admitted to hospital for neutropenic infection, days on in travenous antibiotics, antifungals, nutritional support and intravenous analgesics. For full details of the secondary end -points depicting the potential gain from omission of anthracycline in R1, please see section 7.3.1. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 302 21.3 Randomisation 2 (R2) A randomised study to evaluate the removal of anthracyclines from the delayed intensification block or the removal of vincristine and dexamethasone blocks from the maintenance phase of chemotherapy for patients treated according to the Intermediate Risk -low group of th e ALLTogether -1 protocol. The primary endpoint of this randomisation is DFS. This is a non -inferiority comparison where we aim to show the removal of anthracyclines in DI or vincristine and dexamethasone in maintenance do not result in an unacceptable reduction in the DFS rate. Removing anthracyclines in DI or vincristine and dexamethasone in maintenance will be considered non -inferior if the lower limit of a one -sided 97.5% confidence interval for the difference of the pDFS at 5 years is below 5% (non - inferiority range 5%). Given a baseline pDFS of 0.94 this translates to a non - inferiority margin for the hazard ratio of 1.88. A total of 1279 randomised patients, followed up f or a minimum of 5 years, corresponding to an estimated number of 92 adverse events in the DFS -analysis, would be appropriate to assess non -inferiority of reduced anthracyclines as compared to standard anthracycline in DI or omission of vincristine and dexa methasone in maintenance with 80% power. The one -sided alpha is set to 2.5% instead of 5% because there are two similar randomised questions in the same study population. If we assume a rate of 70% of eligible patients who accept the randomisation and are treated according to the randomised arm we expect 1587 randomised per -protocol patients recruited over a period of 5 years. Thus, we expect the required number of patients to be recruited. Randomisation will be 1:1 for each of the experimental arms compar ed with the controls, using minimisation stratified by country, sex, NCI -risk group (SR: 3 -drug induction, HR: 4 (TEL/AML1, high hyperdiploidy, B -other). Recruitment into R2 will be discontinued after 1279 patients have bee n randomised and found to be evaluable. Since power has been calculated for a five -year recruitment time and a minimum of five years follow -up time for the last recruited patient, the follow -up time will be extended if the recruitment time is significantly shorter than five years. The premise of this randomisation is the same for the removal of anthracycline as stated under R1. For the removal of Vincristine and Dexamethasone pulses, there are some other considerations: The use of Vincristine, particularly prolonged use as in the maintenance phase, is commonly associated with peripheral neurophathy and often needs to be omitted due to toxicity. This is relevant as a secondary end -point which is captured in the periodic reporting of adverse events of special interest during maintenance. Dexamethasone has a large number of potential side -effects, of which aseptic osteonecrosis is one of the most serious, which will also be captured in the mandatory periodic reporting. Another possible side -effect of therapy is weight gain, which will be captured 5 years after cessation of therapy where BMI will be recorded. 21.4 Randomisation 3 (R3 -InO) A randomised study to evaluate the efficacy of Inotuzumab ozogamicin (anti -CD22) in patients treated according to the intermediate -high risk group of the ALL Together -1 protocol. The primary endpoint is DFS, where we aim to show an improvement in the 5 -year rate from 84% to 90% (i.e. an HR of 0.61) compared to standard maintenance. A minimum of 1112 randomised patients would be appropriate to assess this ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 303 improvement with 80% power and a 2-sided 5% alpha . With 1228 patients recruited over 5 years (assuming 39% are Intermediate Risk -High and 80% accept randomisation), an additional 2 years follow -up, a 2 -sided 5% alpha we will have 84% power to detect this difference. Randomisation will be using minimisation stratified by: country, sex, age, WBC, MRD and genetic risk (high -risk genetic changes, TEL/AML1, high hyperdiploidy, B-other). Recruitment into R3 - InO will be discontinued after 1112 patients have been randomised and found to be evaluable. Since power has been calculated for a five -year recruitment time and a minimum of two years follow -up time for the last recruited patient, the follow -up time will be extended if the recruitment time is significantly shorter than five years. 21.5 Non-randomis ed comparisons The two non -randomised comparisons have no formal power calculations. 21.6 Minimum sample size Calculations above have allowed for a minimum of 80% power in all randomisations, with time based on estimated recruitment and dropouts. The table below shows the minimum numbers of patients needed to achieve 80% power in each randomisation. The Independe nt Data Monitoring Committee will review recruitment and efficacy data closely and may recommend closing the study early if the minimum the sample sizes are met and the event rates appear consistent with the estimates used in the sample size calculations. Table 24. Minimum sample sizes per randomisation. Estimated Time to reach 80% power Sample size (80% power) Events (80% power) Recruitment time Sample size (above) Events R1 4.74 years 842 45 5 years 932 50 R2 4.13 years 1279 92 5 years 1587 113 R3 - InO 4.49 years 1112 123 5 years 1228 141 *Calculated based on the addition of an amendment in the spring of 2020 diverting some patients to a new randomised question. DFS (all randomisations) will be calculated from the date of randomisation until the date of death (any cause), relapse or diagnosis of a secondary malignancy (whichever occurs first). Patients without an event will be censored at the date last seen. As they are non-inferiority comparisons, all the primary analyses for R1 and R2 will be per protocol. R3 - InO will be intention to treat, with patients only excluded if they are later found to have been ineligible at randomisation. In R1 and R2 with a basic plan to analyse per protocol, patients who switch from the standard arm to experimental (omitting therapy because of toxicity) will be assigned to the standard arm if they have received any of the standard treatment -element (one dose of Doxorubicin or one VCR -Dexa pulse) and will be assigned to the experimental arm if they have r eceived none of the therapy that was planned to be omitted in the experimental arm. In R3 - InO, patients who switch from the experimental arm because of toxicity to Inotuzumab will be analysed according to ITT. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 304 Randomisations 1 and 2 will be analysed using Cox regression, by verifying whether or not the confidence interval for the hazard ratio contains the value that corresponds to the 5 -year DFS probability specified by the safety margin. Randomisation 3-InO will be analysed using Cox regression, by estimation of differences in HR at 5 years in the experimental arms compared to their controls. The hazard ratio comparing the DFS between the two treatment arms will be calculated from a Cox proportional hazard regression model and equality of the hazards will be assessed with a Wald test, if the proportional hazard assumption is not violated. 21.7 Statistical analysis Analysis of primary endpoint Disease Free Survival (primary endpoint of all randomisations) DFS (all randomisations) will be calculated from the date of randomisation until the date of death (any cause), relapse or diagnosis of a secondary malignancy (whichever occurs first). Patients without an event will be censored at the date last seen. As they are non -inferiority comparisons, all the primary analyses for R1 and R2 will be per protocol i.e. patients will only be included if they started their randomised allocation and do not receive the treatment of the control treatment or parts of that. R3 - InO will be intention to treat, with patients only excluded if they are later found to have been ineligible at randomisation. Randomisations 1 and 2 Randomisations 1 and 2 will be analysed using Cox regression . For R1, non-inferiority will be established if the upper limit of the two -sided 90 % confidence interval for the hazard ratio is below the value that corresponds to the specified 5 -year DFS probability (i.e. the non -inferiority HRs quoted above). A 95% two -sided confidence interval for th e hazard ratio will also be presented. For the three -arm randomisation R2, a multiple testing adjustment will be applied, using a one -sided alpha of 2.5% in each comparison. Thus, for R2, non-inferiority will be established if the upper limit of the two -sided 95 % confidence interval for at least one of the hazard ratio s is below the value that corresponds to the specified 5 -year DFS probability (i.e. the non -inferiority HRs quoted above) . Two-sided 97.5% confidence intervals for the hazard ratios will also be presented. The Cox regression model s will include the stratification variables used in the minimization: country, sex, NCI -risk group (SR: 3 -drug induction, 4 (TEL/AML1, high hyperdiploidy, B -other). The assumption of proportional hazards will be assessed using Schoenfeld residuals, and if violated the primary analysis will report the varying hazard ratio over the follow -up time along with their 95% confidence intervals. Randomisation 3 (R3 -InO) The Kaplan -Meier method will be used for estimation of the 5-year DFS. The hazard ratio comparing the DFS between the two treatment arms will be calculated from a Cox proportional hazard regression model and equality of the hazards assessed with a Wald test, if the proportional hazard assumption is not violated. The Cox regression model will include the stratification variables used in the minimization: country, sex, age, WBC, MRD and genetic risk (high -risk genetic changes, TEL/AML1, high hyperdiploidy, B -other). The assumption of proportional hazards will be assessed ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 305 using Schoenfeld residuals, and if violated the primary analysis will report the varying hazard ratio over the follow -up time along with their 95% confidence intervals. Analysis of secondary endpoints and secondary analyses Time to event endpoints (all randomisations): 1) Overall Survival (event: death from any cause) 2) Cumulative Incidence of Relapse (event: relapse) 3) Cumulative Incidence of DCR1 (event: death in complete remission) 4) Cumulative Incidence of SMN (event: second malignancy) 5) Cumulative Incidence of CD22 negative relapse (Randomisation 3 only, event: CD22 - relapse) Overall Survival will be will be measured from the date of randomisation until the date of the death. Patients who are alive at the t ime of the analysis will be censored at the date last seen. This will be analysed using Cox regression and the Kaplan -Meier method will be used for estimation of the 5-year DFS. The endpoints listed in (2) -(5) will be measured from the date of randomisation until the date of the event and estimated using the Aalen -Johansen estimator. Differences for the randomised arms will be compared using Gray's test. Patients who do not experience the event will be censored at the date last seen and the alternative endpoints listed in (2)-(4) will be considered competing events. Data will also be analysed using competing -risk regression and cumulative incidence curves. Time to event analyses for the whole cohort All time to event endpoints (including DFS) will also be presented for the whole cohort for comparison with historical data. This will use the date of diagnosis as the time of origin in the EFS analyses and time of complete remission as time of origin for the DFS analysis . Other endpoints Cumulative incidence of SCT in CR2: This will be estimated using the Aalen -Johansen estimator and compared between groups using Gray's test. 21.8 Toxicity R1 and R2 Rates of non -lethal toxicity including febrile neutropenia, invasive fungal infection, serious mucositis with need for intravenous analgesics and/or TPN and the incidence of SAEs (except AESI) will be presented as proportions (by treatm ent block where appropriate) and compared between the arms using Poisson regression to allow for adjustment of important baseline factors, using follow -up time as an offset variable. The time -interval between the start of DI and the start of the next tr eatment -phase in days will be compared using a Wilcoxon -Mann Whitney test. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 306 R3 - InO Randomisation 3 has additional toxicity endpoints (see section 7.3.4), again, proportions of patients experiencing these events will be compared using Poisson regression, with follow -up time as an offset variable, (including multivariable models adjusted for baseline risk factors) and appropriate descriptive statistics used to describe their timing and severity. 21.9 Other analyses Days admitted to hospital during the randomis ed phase, days on iv antibiotics, days on advanced antifungals, days on nutritional support with parenteral nutrition will be compared using Poisson regression with follow -up time as an offset variable, taking into account differing lengths of follow -up be tween patients. 21.10 Subgroup analyses Subgroup analyses will be performed for each randomisation on all stratification factors as well as the following variables: Response -groups (MRD), immunophenotype where applicable (R2), CNS -involvement at diagnosis. Economic evaluation Sub-studies are planned for evaluation of impact on Quality of Life (QoL) of the de - intensification randomisations (R1 and R2). It is likely that evaluation of impact on health economics will also be a part of this evaluation. 21.11 Interim analyses None of the randomisations have formal interim analyses but an Independent Data Monitoring Committee will review the unblinded data at least yearly and can recommend stopping the trial if there are any safety or efficacy concerns. R3 - InO will also have an analysis of toxicity after 50 I nO treated patients to ensure the safety of the regimen. Data for the cohort as a whole (i.e. no randomised comparisons) will be monitored by investigators from all countries to ensure that the ALLtogether strate gy does not appear worse than results from previous studies. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 307 22. STUDY ORGANIZATION STRUCTU RE The protocol was developed and designed as a collaboration within a consortium of study groups from 14 countries, the five Nordic countries, Estonia, Lithuania (NOPHO), the UK (UKALL), the Netherlands (DCOG), Germany (CoALL), Belgium (BSPHO), Portugal (SHOP), Ireland (PHOAI), France (SFCE) and a group from adult haematology departments from NOPHO, the UK and Ireland treating patients older than 18 years at diagno sis - the \"teenager and young adult - TYA-group\". Representatives from these groups participate in the Steering committee for the study, which takes all strategic decisions and works as a reference group for the specialized working -groups. All data within the study are in principle owned collectively by the consortium and the use of these data is subject to approval by the steering committee. A number of working -groups have been formed dealing with specific aspects of the protocol work, such as MRD - and genetic diagnostics, statistics, therapeutic drug - monitoring of Asparaginase, CNS -issues etc. The sponsor for the whole study is the Karolinsk a University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. The Trial Central Office ( TCO) consists of a Chief Investigator (CI), and a Trial Manager (TM) and regulatory specialist . The TCO serves as a central resource for comprehensive regulatory and administrative issues, provision of essential information, documents and overall communication through web -portal, newsletters etc. Central data -management (data -checks and communication of basic queries) is managed from the TCO by a Data Management team (Data Managers, Statisticians etc.) according to the Data Management Plan. Each participating country has a delegated National Principal Investigator, who collaborates with a Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) to perform national duties such as application and reporting to national authorities as well as monitoring activities on national level according to the Monitoring Plan . It is also a national responsibility to establish center -contracts and othe r applicable contracts (such as with for instance pharmacies) and to ensure that insurance cover for the participating subjects from the country in question is in place. Each participating centre (site) will have a responsible Principal Investigator. The s ponsor has established an agreement with a Central CTU in Stockholm ( CKC ) with extended responsibilities covering the safety reporting, Pharmacovigilance as well as annual safety reports, access and administration of the randomisation programs. In addition, the sponsor /or designee has a written agreement with the Compan ies Pfizer , Servier and CSM for funding and /or IMP supply /or IMP handling , relabelling and distribution . 23. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENTS The risk/benefit assessment includes the risks and benefit to patient\u00b4s safety in relation to Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) and all other risks related to the design and methods of the study - including general risks to participant safety and rights as well as reliability of results. The potential risks are balanced against the level of risk that a study patient would be exposed to outside of the study . When a pediatric oncology study is risk classified, some specific considerations are importa nt; children belong to a vulnerable group of patients and pediatric oncology treatment may be associated with severe damage (treatment -related death), which would mean that all studies automatically would be scaled up to the category of \"high risk\". Conseq uently, all pediatric oncology studies should be intensively monitored. However, it has been questioned whether this risk classification is correct when it comes to clinical studies in pediatric oncology. Pediatric oncology treatment with chemotherapy, rad iotherapy and surgery is associated with high -risks, but to some extent this is proportional to the severity of the underlying disease. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 308 The risk to patients in this study will be minimi sed by compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria, monitoring and adh erence to guidelines for investigators concerning specific safety areas. Some toxicity must be considered acceptable since the treatment intensity is required to cure the majority of patients. Toxicities usually include infections, which occur despite the best efforts to avoid them, in some cases including the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis. The backbone protocol (induction, consolidation, delayed -intensification, CNS - directed therapy, maintenance) is considered standard of care (SOC). All drugs are medicinal products with marketing authori sations in pediatric oncology or with extensive experience from pediatric oncology treatment protocols. Thus there are no study -specific risks associated with the SOC -therapy. However, the protocol constitutes an am algamation of therapy from different study -groups and the overall results will be supervised by the steering committee, who will receive annual reports including aggregated results for the whole protocol as well as stratified per clinical characteristics. Through this report, the steering committee will be able to compare current results with historic outcomes to ensure the overall performance of the protocol and take appropriate action. Furthermore, national Principal Investigators have a responsibility to inform investigators at local centres of the results in this report and also take any concerns from local investigators to the steering committee should the need arise. In addition to the backbone protocol, randomisation s will be introduced. These randomi sation s have different risk profiles. Two of these randomisation s include reductions of intensive treatment for the patients stratified into lower risk groups. The reduction of acute and long -term toxicity (in particular toxic deaths) is becoming increasin gly important in order to further improve the treatment outcomes. However, there is an alternative risk built into the study design, which is that the risk that the decreased intensity in the experimental arm lead s to an increased incidence of relapse and death from disease, or toxicity associated with more intensive relapse - therapy. Since this is the experimental intervention for these randomisations and the control arm patients receive SOC, this is the only study -specific risk for these patient - population s. The risk will be monitored by annual reports to the Data -Safety - Monitoring -Board (DSMB) and this is considered sufficient, since the relapse -rate in this patient population is expected to be low and relapses are expected to occur late. The intensificati on- randomisations introduces a new drug or a new combination of old drugs. This is also the case for patients with ABL -class fusions, who will receive TKI in combination with standard chemotherapy (NRI1). This is naturally associated with the risk of hit herto unknown toxicity of the new c ompounds/the new combinations. By adding the new drug/the new combinations to the backbone treatment, the intention is to improve the prevention of relapses, and thereby prevent both death from disease as well as future t oxicity and treatment related mortality caused by intensive relapse treatment. The high risk of relapse in these patients is the motivation for taking the risk of additional new toxicity. Detailed information about the risk assessments for the intensifi cation-randomisation s are found in the separate protocol (\"Inotuzumab -protocol \"). In the intensification -randomisations as well as for patients treated with TKI, data on the incidence of known toxicities will be systematically collected in the CRFs to gain more robust data on the frequency and severity of these toxicities. The lower grades of these will be listed as exemptions from SAE -reporting, but there will also be a focus on expedited reporting of higher grades of known toxicities and new toxicities as SAE-reports. In general, adverse event reporting procedures are dependent on if the patients is treated according to standard of care or participating in a randomisation /experimental intervention. Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be reporte d after each therapy -phase for all patients. For patients treated according to standard of care and in the de -intensification -randomisations, no other AEs will be reported, but the AESI - ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 309 reporting will be more extensive after the randomised phases to detect a possible gain from the de -intensification . AESI -reporting will also be extended for specific toxicities for the intensification -randomisations. Both basic leukemia -specific outcomes, AESIs, higher grades of toxicity from SAE -reports (excluding SAE excep tions) as well as the frequency of lower -grade toxicity in the randomised arms will be reported to the DSMB for all randomisations/experimental interventions. The therapeutic drug monitoring of PEG -Asp activity is not assessed to be associated with any study -specific risks. There are obvious benefits: The detection of inactivation of the antileukaemic drug opens the possibility for effective replace ment therapy to be implemented. 24. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO N The study protocol and informed consent procedures we re designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmoni sed Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice with applicable local and European regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC or the new Regulation EU No 536 /2014 when it comes into effect) and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients or their legal guardians by proxy, will be informed of the study and will have to give their informed consent to participation without t heir decision affecting the medical care they receive. All study subjects are also informed of their right to immediately and without motivation leave the study should they wish to do so. The protocol and proposed informed consent forms will be reviewed a nd approved by an IRB/IEC in each participating country before start of the study. Prior to study start, the principle investigator at each center is also required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accor dance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to the sponsor, field monitors, auditors, quality assurance representatives, designated agents by sponsor, IRB/ IECs and regulatory authorities as required. The Investigator will submit , and, where necessary, obtain approval from the above parties for all substantial amendments to the original approved documents. The rights, safety and well -being of the study subjects are the most important considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society. Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform their respective task(s) and will be authori sed to perform study related procedures as laid down in the delegation log. It is our duty as physicians to both care for our patients the best way we can , and, at the same time, we have a duty to develop the therapy for these and coming generat ions of patients by the design of experimental therapy to be tested against standard treatment. The experimental interventions in the study are designed to relieve some of the burden of therapy for some patient -groups, by attenuation of the therapy, but may result in worse leukaemia -specific outcomes. Other experimental interventions are designed to intensify the therapy for patients at high risk of relapse. These interventions may introduce new toxicities further burdening these patients, who would have had a reasonable chance of cure also without the experimental therapy. To ensure the safety of the study -subjects, interim results will be regularly (once yearly) reported to a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), who will scrutini se the results and make a n assessment if the possible gains by the study are still worth the calculated risk of continuing the patients to the experimental therapy. This should be seen as both a scientific and an ethical safeguard for the participating patients. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 310 25. INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY Patient insurances are contracted on the national level. 26. PUBLICATION POLICY The ALLTogether Protocol has been conceived by the amalgamation of 8 study - groups into the ALLTogether consortium. All important consortium decisions are taken by the ALLTogether steering committee and it also includes the production of any future publicat ion in the name of the consortium with regard to patient - populations, scope, focus and co -authorship. No individual, or participating study - group is allowed to publish any data that belongs to the collective consortium without the agreement of the study steering committee. No individual or participating study - group is allowed to publish data pertaining to the patients from the study -group in question before all relevant publications concerning the patient -population in the consortium have been published wit hout the knowledge and approval of the study steering committee. In addition, all publications from the ALLTogether consortium will comply with the guidelines provided by the ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) concerning the definition of authorship and ethical rules regarding scientific publications. 27. END OF STUDY REPORT In line with the End of Study Definitions above, each part of the study that closes will, in addition to the sc ientific publications emanating from this part of the study also file a brief end of study report. The platform trial will file a final end of study report when the last part of the study has been closed and reported scientifically. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 311 28. PROTOCOL GUIDELINES The ALLTogether protocol includes three types of guidelines: Laboratory o Genetic screening o Detection of MRD by FCM o Detection of MRD by molecular techniques (PCR) Procedural o Bone -marrow aspiration o Diagnostic lumbar puncture Clinical o TPMT and NUDT15 testing and dosing of Thiopurines o Maintenance therapy o Dose -adaption of Imatinib due to toxicity o Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of Asparaginas activity These are all considered as mandatory parts of the protocol and contains essential information for uni form protocol standards, performance and management. Detailed descriptions of these guidelines can be found in the section below. In addition, there is a collection of separate documents that do not have protocol status, containing general recommendations pertaining to clinical situations for which the participating countries may also have national guidelines. These separate documents are referred to in the protocols as \"guidelines (optional)\" and are made available to investigators at the closed protocol website. The decision to use these optional -, or national guidelines is the choice of the treating physician. The following optional guidelines are available: Administration of High -dose Metothrexate Carboxypeptidase to treat dangerously Metothrexate Asparagine -induced pancreatitis Osteonecrosis ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 312 29. LABORATORY GUIDELINES 29.1 Summary of the recommendations from the ALLTogether Genetics group for the genetic screening of patients treated on the ALLTogether1 Protocol CLINICAL STUDY: ALLTogether EUDRACT number : 2018 -001795 -38 DEVELOPMENT PHASE III DOCUMENT TYPE: Laboratory Study Protocol Guidelines NAME OF GUIDELINE: Summary of the recommendations from the ALLTogether Genetics group for the genetic screening of patients treated on the ALLTogether1 Protocol AUTHORS: Anthony Moorman, Bertil Johansson, Monique Gameiro, Nadine SPONSOR: Karolinska University Hospital CHIEF INVESTIGATOR: MD PhD Mats Heyman VERSION number: FINAL Version 1.0 RELEASE DATE: 5 August 2019 ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 313 1) Development of the integrated MRD and genetic risk stratification algorithm Allocation of induction therapy will follow the schema used by the current UKALL2011 trial. Briefly, National Cancer Institute (NCI) B -cell precursor (BCP) standard risk patients (1 to <10 years old and white cell count <50x109/L) will receive three -drug induction whilst all T -ALL patients and NCI high risk BCP -ALL patients will receive a four-drug induction. Measurable residual disease (MRD) defined risk groups at the end of induction (EOI) At the end of induction (EOI), measurable residual disease (MRD) will be assessed by PCR analysis of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements or flow cyto metry (see MRD section for details). Data from previous trials have shown that patients with undetectable MRD at the EOI have an excellent outcome with 5 -year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates exceeding 95% and 99%. [13, 116] In contrast, patients with high MRD have a very poor outcome with 5 -year EFS rates of <50%. [89] Therefore, patients will be divided into three initial risk groups: (1) standard risk (SR), patients with undetectable MRD; (2) intermediate risk (IR) patients with detectable MRD but <5%; and (3) high risk (HR) patients with MRD 5% at EOI (time point 1; TP1). Based on data f rom previous trials (UKA LL2003, DCOG10, NOPHO2008 and Co ALL08 -09) we estimated that the sizes of these three risk groups will be 25%, 70% and 5%. Patients in the IR group will be further divided based on genetics, MRD at time point 2 (TP2, end of consolida tion) and age - see below - into IR -low and IR -high. At TP2 patients with persistent MRD 0.05% will be transferred to the HR arm. Allocation of patients with high risk genetics across the MRD defined risk groups Numerous publications have identified five chromosomal abnormalities that have consistently been associated with a high risk of relapse and therefore poor overall survival: KMT2A (iAMP21) and t(17;19)(q22;p13)/ TCF3 -HLF.[123] In order to determine the most appropriate allocation of patients with one of these abnormalities within the aforementioned MRD defined risk groups, we pooled data from previous trials conducted by consortia members: UKALL2003, DCOG10, NOPHO2008 and C oALL97/03/09. A total of 227 patients were available for retrospective analysis covering all each subgroup, we examined the outcome of patients overall and by MRD level using the thresholds used to define the MRD risk groups. The key question addressed was whether patients with high risk genetics and low levels of MRD at EOI should be allocated to the SR or IR -low subgroups and therefore be eligible for treatme nt de - intensification. Among 123 KMT2A -r cases, 25 (20%) had no informative MRD result; mostly due to a lack of sensitive TCR/Ig markers for quantitative real -time PCR. A total of 21/98 (21%) cases had undetectable MRD at EOI and although none had relapsed so far, the follow - up time for 10 patients was <4 years. At the other end of the spectrum, >30% cases with MRD>5% relapsed compared with 16% cases with detectable MRD but <5%. Virtually all KMT2A -r cases had been treated as high risk. So, despite some evi dence of a better outcome for KMT2A -r patients with low EOI MRD, this was only achieved with intensive therapy. None of the NH or HoL patients treated on these historic trials had undetectable MRD at EOI and the 5 -year EFS rates were 64% and 69%, respectiv ely, despite being treated on the HR arms. Although the proportion of iAMP21 patients with undetectable MRD at EOI was similar to the overall percentage (i.e. 25%), ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 314 the relapse rate was 25% which was the same as the relapse rate for all iAMP21 patients (23 %). Given these results we decided that all patients with KMT2A -r, NH, HoL or iAMP21 should not be eligible for any treatment de -intensification and therefore these patients should be allocated to the IR -high group unless their EOI MRD was >5% in which cas e they should be allocated to the HR group. In addition, patients with HR genetics should switch from the three drug to the four drug induction regimen at day 15. The t(17;19) translocation is very rare (<0.1%) and only 4 patients were available for analy sis (all from UKALL2003). All these patients relapsed and died within 2 years of diagnosis which mirrors the dismal response reported in the literature from other protocols. [124, 167] Hence, we opted to assign all t(17;19) directly to the HR group. There is a strong association between HoL and TP53 mutations, and there is evidence that many of the TP53 mutations are germline. [168] We recommend that the protocol highlights this association and advises clinicians to perform a detailed family history. If necessary, the clinician should consider referring the family to a clinical geneticist for counselling and germline screening accord ing to local / national guidelines. The presence of a germline TP53 mutation has obvious implications for the family but also potentially for the downstream treatment options of the patients should they fail front line therapy. Allocation of patients with targetable gene fusions associated with BCR -ABL1 -like ALL Several years ago, gene expression profiling (GEP) studies identified a novel subgroup of ALL which had a GEP resembling that seen in BCR -ABL1 positive patients but occurred in patients lacking the fusion. It was termed BCR -ABL1 -like or Philadelphia - like ALL and accounted for 10 -15% BCP -ALL.[82, 83] Further genomic studies of BCR -ABL1 -like patients harboured recurrent genetic lesions affecting a genes, genes is now termed ABL -class (Table 1) because the resulting fusion has similar functional consequences to the canonical BCR -ABL1 fusion, i.e. deregulation of tyrosine kinase activity. Studies have found that patients with ABL -class fusi ons have high levels of MRD post induction and a significantly higher relapse risk compared with other BCP -ALL patients. [52, 84, 169, 170] Although pre -dominantly found in BCP -ALL, studies have identified rare cases with T -ALL.[171, 172] This association with poor outcome was mirrored in the data we pooled from 31 patients harbouring ABL -class fusions and tre ated on historic UK, DCOG and Co ALL protocols. None of the patients had undetectable MRD at the end of induction; in contrast, 74% had MRD>1%. The outcome of the ABL -class fusion patients was poor with 11/23 (48%) patients with MRD>1% suffering induction failure or relapse and 3/8 (38%) of the remaining patients relapsing. There is growing in vitro , in vivo , ex vivo and clinical evidence that patients harbouring one of these ABL -class fusions are imatinib and dasatinib. [85] This evidence includes reports of patients with refractory disease at EOI achieving complete remission after treatment with a TKI. [86, 87] Several clinical study groups (e.g. COG [84, 88] ) have altered their frontline protocols to identify these patients rapidly and add a TKI to these children's therapy. In UKALL2011, B -other and T -ALL patients with high at EOI are screened for ABL -class fusions and, if present, are treated with imatinib in addition to standard chemotherapy. [52, 89] A large intergroup study of children with BCR -ABL1 + ALL showed that the addition of imatinib to an intensive chemotherapy regimen improved disease free survival by ~20% compared with historical cohorts. [90] There is also evidence that adding a TKI during induction is more beneficial than later on. [91] On the basis of this evidence, we have opted to allocate all patients harbouring an ABL -class fusion to the IR -high arm and to have their chemotherapy supplemented with imatinib from day 15. This allocation to ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 315 IR-high is irrespective of their MRD at EOI even if it is >5%. ABL -class patients who do not respond to imatinib (as measured by IG/TCR P CR MRD / flow) by time point 2 will be allocated to the HR arm. ABL -class fusions have been reported in T -ALL patients [172, 173] (unpublished observations) albeit rarely and primarily as a secondary abnormality. Approximately 5% of T -ALL harbour a NUP214 -ABL1 fusion which show a variable response to imatinib. [174] At the time of writing these guidelines there is uncertainty as to whether T -ALL with ABL -class fusion should be treated with imatinib. Hence we recommend that all patients with T -ALL are screened for ABL -class fusions but that treatment with imatinib should be discussed on an individual basis with the national principal investigator. Identifying prognostic factors in the MRD intermediate risk group The intermediate risk (IR) MRD group (i.e. patients with detectable MRD but <5% at TP1) will constitute the largest subgroup accounting for ~70% patients. This subgroup will comprise patients previously classified as both MRD negative and positive because it encompasses the traditional MRD threshold of 0.01% (1x10-4) used by the UKALL, DCOG, NOPHO and Co ALL protocols. Hence the outcome heterogeneity that exists within this subgroup is self -evident given the prognostic impact of MRD reported by numerous clinical study groups. [12, 13, 25, 113] There is ample evidence in the literature to support the assertion that numerous risk factors will drive outcome within this subgroup, including MRD levels, [116, 130] However, there are no studies directly focus sed on defining a group of patients with IR MRD at EOI who have an excellent outcome (i.e. relapse risk <5%, EFS>90%) and who may be suitable for treatment de -escalation. Therefore, we pooled individual patient data from 3,284 patients who had been treate d on UKA LL2003, DCOG10, NOPHO2008 and Co ALL97/03/09 trials and would be classified as IR by the aforementioned criteria (see Figure 1). To minimise demographic, clinical and treatment heterogeneity within this pooled cohort, we excluded patients treated as very low risk on COALL protocols and high risk on DCOG and NOPHO protocols because these treatment regimens were classified as significantly different from the treatment regimens being considered for IR patients in this protocol. In addition, we excluded patients >25 years old, Down syndrome and t(9;22)/ BCR -ABL1 patients. Our analysis focussed on evaluating the following risk factors: MRD, primary genetic events and CNA. The primary outcome metric used was risk of relapse defined as the time from achieving a complete remission to the date of relapse at any site and censoring patients who died in CR1. The aim of the analysis was to identify a subset of IR patients who had a good outcome (IR -low) which was defined as a risk of relapse at 5 years <5%, and EFS at 5 years of >91% and accounted for ~50% of the group. The remaining patients would be classified as IR -high. This would enable two randomisations to be implemented with the protocol. A large meta -analysis of >13,000 patients demonstrated that MRD was as sociated with clinical outcome across therapies, times of assessment (post -induction and post - consolidation) and patient subgroups. [92] In addition, more recently an in -depth analysis of the prognostic value of MRD in UKALL2003 showed that the risk of relapse associated with a specific MRD level post -induction varied according to genetic subgroup. [116] Therefore, w e sought to compare the effect of MRD post -induction and post-consolidation within our pooled IR cohort and to determine the most discriminatory MRD threshold. Cox regression analysis showed the MRD measured post-induction was more powerful than when measu red post -consolidation: post - induction hazard ratio = 1.22 (95% CI 1.16 -1.28), p<0.001 v 1.08 (1.10 -1.15), p=0.018. In addition, the C -index (which measures the concordance between the prediction and the actual outcome for the model [133] ) was greater for post -induction MRD compared ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 316 to post -consolidation MRD : 66.1% v 58.4%. Threshold analysis revealed that for BCP - ALL, MRD post -induction was always more informative than post -consolidation MRD due to the fact that 70% cases had undetectable MRD post -consolidation; hence any threshold examined was biased toward s this large group. In contrast, post - consolidation MRD was more informative among T -ALL patients where patients with detectable disease at any level had a significantly inferior outcome (Figure 1 Panel B). We were able to subdivide the BCP -ALL cohort acco rding to the presence of a number of different genetic subgroups. Utilising MRD threshold analysis we found that the most discriminatory MRD threshold varied by genetic subgroup (Figure 1 Panel B). This analysis revealed a number of subgroups defined by ge netics and MRD that were associated with either a low or high risk of relapse. The objective of this analysis was to identify a large subgroup of IR cases associated with a good outcome. Therefore, we defined the IR -low as those patients who were in any of the four good risk subgroups defined by MRD and genetics (Table 2, Figure 2). All remaining IR cases were classified as IR -high and were grouped with those cases that had been allocated to IR -high by virtue of their age (16 years or the presence of high risk genetic abnormalities; see above). We had insufficient data to assess reliably the prognostic impact of genetic abnormalities in T -ALL. A review of the literature did not identify any validated prognostic genetic factors in T -ALL that could be used fo r further risk stratification. Table 2 shows the final definition of IR -low/high along with estimated size and outcomes. Patients with Down syndrome (DS) Patients with ALL and DS will be treated on a separate but related protocol. It is well established that the genetic profile of DS -ALL patients is distinct. [135] A pre vious study involving data from two of the study groups in the ALLTogether consortium (UKALL & DCOG) identified IKZF1 deletions as a key prognostic marker in DS -ALL (Table 3a).[175] In order to further inform the risk stratification of DS -ALL patients for this protocol, we examined the effect of different MRD levels on outcome among DS -ALL from across the consortium (Table 3b). The low number of cases prevented an extensive analysis but clearl y demonstrated that the same initial MRD threshold (undetectable and 5%) can be applied to DS -ALL patients as well. Therefore, DS -ALL patients will be assigned to one of three risk groups at the end of induction: Standard risk arm: MRD TP1 undetectable o Patients with high risk genetics, IKZF1 deletion, CNS3 or TLP are excluded High risk arm: MRD TP1 5% Intermediate risk arm: all other patients Implications of the risk stratification algorithm for turn -around times All genetic testing must be performed on a leukaemia sample (bone marrow or peripheral blood with high WCC) taken before the initiation of treatment. While genetic testing should be performed and reported as soon as possible, the use of certain genetic abnormalities to direct therapy means that c ertain information is required at specific time points (see Figure 2): Patients with ABL -class fusions are scheduled to start imatinib on day 15 of the protocol. Hence testing for rearrangements of ABL1, ABL2, PDGFRB and CSF1R must be completed and reporte d before day 15. Patients with high risk genetics who are initially allocated to a three drug induction will switch to a four drug induction at day 15. Hence testing for KMT2A gene fusions, NH, HoL, iAMP21 and TCF3 -HLF must be completed and ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 317 reported befor e day 15. In addition, these patients are NOT eligible for allocation to the SR or IR -low groups. Patients initially classified to the IR group who have good risk genetic features and a good MRD response will be eligible for allocation to the IR -low at th e end of consolidation. Therefore, testing for ETV6 -RUNX1 , high hyperdiploidy and the UKALL CNA profile must be completed and reported by day 71. For patients with DS -ALL, the IKZF1 deletion status will need to assigned by day 28. Summary of recommendat ions: Patients with HR genetics (KMT2A -r, NH, HoL or iAMP21) are not eligible for treatment de -intensification and should hence be allocated to IR -high group unless their EOI MRD is >5% in which case they should be allocated to the HR group. In addition, patients with HR genetics should switch from the three drug to the four drug induction regimen at day 15. Patients with t(17;19)/TCF3 -HLF fusion are directly assigned to the HR group irrespective of MRD levels. Patients harbouring an ABL -class fusion will be allocated to the IR -high arm and will receive chemotherapy supplemented with imatinib from day 15. This allocation to IR -high is irrespective of their MRD at EOI even if it is >5%. ABL -class patients who do not respond to imatinib at TP2 will be allocat ed to the HR arm. Patients initially classified into the IR group on the basis of MRD levels at EOI will be further stratified according to genetics and treatment response. Patients with good risk genetic features (ETV6 -RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy, good risk UKALL -CNA profile) and good treatment response as determined by genotype -specific threshold will be classified as IR -low. All other patients will be classified as IR -high. Patients with T -ALL must fusions. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 318 2. Genetic diagnostic procedures in the ALLTogether protocol The methods that can be used to screen for the risk -stratifying genetic aberrations or karyotypic abnormality patterns in the ALLTogether protocol are listed below and also summarized in Table 4 . Considering the large number of centers involved in genetic diagnostics in the ALLTogether protocol, the methods suggested are those that generally are available and clinically validated in most laboratories, such as different types of DNA -based array, f luorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcription -polymerase -dependent probe amplification and chromosome banding analyses. Although several next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, such as whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and RNA/transcriptome sequencing, are increasingly being applied in research, NGS is, at present, not considered properly validated for c linical routine diagnostics in most laboratories, but this may of course change in the near future. For the time being, validated NGS analyses may be offered by some \"core\" diagnostic centers and used, for example, to identify ABL - class and KMT2A fusion pa rtners. The list of actionable chromosomal abnormalities listed in Table 1 contains numerous primary abnormalities which can co -exist. Patients very rarely harbour >1 gene fusion and hence the detection of one gene fusion excuses the laboratory from screening for other gene fusions. Similarly the co -occurrence of gene fusions with iAMP21, NH and HoL is extremely rare; so testing for gene fusions after the detection of one of these abnormalities is not essential. However, there are numerous reports of gene fusions c o-occurring with HeH. Hence all patients with HeH should be screened by an appropriate method for other abnormalities. All BCP -ALL patients should be screened for copy number alterations. All laboratories performing diagnostic genetics tests for ALLToget her patients must be active members of an external quality assessment scheme; for example the Genomics Quality Assessment (GenQA) https://www.genqa.org/ Methods The predictive value of diagnostic tests depends on t he quality of bone marrow aspirates as well as the type of anti -coagulants and the percentage of leukemic blasts. Therefore, we have indicated per method in Table 4 the preferred collection tube and minimal percent of blasts (determined in that tube) that are required in order to report a negative result. If the percent of blasts cannot be determined in the specified tube used for the indicated technology, we suggest using the percentage of blasts in other diagnostic tubes, e.g. MRD tube. If testing fails t o identify any genetic abnormality then laboratories should make every attempt to rule out a false negative result and issue a qualified or inconclusive result as necessary. 1. Arrays Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP -A) and array comparative gen omic hybridization (array -CGH) analyses are the preferred methods to detect the ploidy groups high hyperdiploidy (HeH, 51 -65/67 chromosomes), low hypodiploidy (HoL, 30 - ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 319 39 chromosomes), and near haploidy (NH, 25 -29 chromosomes). Because SNP -A also identifie s uniparental isodisomies (UPIDs), it is considered superior to array - CGH for identifying duplicated clones of NH and HoL (see below), which may be misinterpreted as HeH. In addition, arrays can be used to identify iAMP21 and, depending on the level of resolution of the array applied, deletions involving as deletions involving the pseudoautosomal region 1 (P AR1) resulting in rearrangement of the CRLF2 gene. If properly validated, array -based methods are considered sufficient to detect and refute the presence of ploidy shifts, iAMP21, and gene deletions. 2. FISH Interphase FISH with locus -specific, commercia lly available probes can be used to detect the fusion genes BCR -ABL1 (positive cases are excluded from rearrangements involving -specific probe for RUNX1 can also be used to screen for iAMP21. However, if interphase FISH analysis suggests the presence of iAMP21, this must be confirmed by metaphase FISH analysis in ord er to verify that the extra RUNX1 signals are located on one abnormal chromosome 21. FISH analyses are considered sufficient to detect and refute the presence / RT -PCR RT-PCR can be used to identify the fusion genes BCR -ABL1 (positive cases are excluded from using primers properly validated in respective laboratories. If no fusion transcript is found, that is sufficient to exclude the presence of these fusions (albeit some fusions may, depending on the location of the primers used, go undetected due to rare t ranscripts involving alternative exons). Best practice guidelines indicate that positive BCR -ABL1 results should be confirmed by a second technique. The large number of fusion partner genes that RT -PCR alone cannot be used to screen for rearrangements of these genes. 4. MLPA MLPA with a commercially developed probe mix can be used to identify deletions sufficient to d etect and refute the presence of such deletions. 5. Southern blot Southern blot analysis for KMT2A rearrangements, using three restriction digests, is sufficient to both detect and exclude the presence of such rearrangements. Although nowadays rarely use d in clinical routine, Southern blot analysis can be of value in rare cases with, for example, FISH patterns suggesting deletions of the 3` part of the KMT2A probe, which could indicate either a bona fide KMT2A rearrangement or a deletion of the entire KMT 2A gene. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 320 6. Chromosome banding Chromosome banding analysis may be used to identify the ploidy groups HeH, HoL, and NH. However, in case of a normal karyotype or karyotypic failure, the presence of these ploidy groups must be screened for by alternative met hods (SNP -A or by chromosome banding analysis must be confirmed to result in their respective genes or RT -PCR analyses. Although chromosome banding analysis is not compulsory in the ALLTogether protocol, cells should always be cultured for analysis and then stored in fixative. This will enable subse quent analysis in cases where, for example, the FISH signal patterns are difficult to interpret. Genetic aberrations/karyotypic abnormality patterns that should be screened for 1. Ploidy shifts (HeH, HoL, and NH) The preferred methods are SNP -A or array -CGH, with the former having the advantage of also identifying UPIDs. Chromosome banding analysis is an option but is uninformative in cases with a normal karyotype or karyotypic failure. DNA index measurements are h elpful in identifying aneuploidy but provide no information on specific chromosome gains. It is very important to differentiate between HeH and duplicated NH and HoL clones. Not only the number of chromosomes but also the patterns of trisomic and tetraso mic chromosomes, as well as the number and types of UPIDs, must be taken into account. Typical gains in HeH involve chromosomes X, 4, 6, 10, 14, 17, 18, and 21 (with the latter most often being tetrasomic). Duplicated NH clones typically display only a few tetrasomies, involving, for example, chromosome 21 (always), 14, 18, and X, but no trisomies. Furthermore, the disomic chromosomes are all UPIDs, easily detected by SNP -A. Duplicated HoL clones are most often near -triploid; such clones should be grouped a s HoL. In rare instances, duplicated HoL clones may have modal chromosome numbers between 60 and 67 and be misinterpreted as HeH. Duplicated HoL clones may be distinguished by often harboring gains of chromosomes 1 and 19, more tetrasomies than trisomies, and several (>4) UPIDs, all of which are rare in HeH. It should be emphasized that approximately 25% of \"true\" HeH cases harbor 1 - 4 UPIDs; thus, the mere presence of UPIDs cannot be used as evidence for duplicated NH/HoL clones. Approximately 3% of HeH cases should be screened for these gene fusions as well as ABL -class fusions. Patients which harbor both HeH and a gene fusion should be classified according to the fusion. 2. iAMP21 This abnormality is best detected by FISH at the metaphase level using the internationally recognized definition of three or more extra RUNX1 signals on a single ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 321 abnormal chromosome 21. Copy number profiling using SNP -A, array -CGH, or MLPA reveals a distinctive profile including an amplified region of 5.1 Mb between 32,813,553 and 37,941,425 bp that includes the RUNX1 gene. [176] Chromosome banding analysis cannot be used because of the highly variable morphology of the abnormal chromosome 21, which is often mistaken as a marker chromosome. 3. KMT2A rearrangements Rearrangements of the KMT2A gene can be identified by FISH or Sout hern blot analyses. It is not compulsory to identify the partner genes, but from a scientific point of view such information is important to collect in order to ascertain the prognostic effect of different fusion transcripts. Detection of 11q23 translocati ons, including t(4;11)(q21;q23), by chromosome banding analysis alone is not sufficient to conclude that they involve the KMT2A gene. Thus, such abnormalities must be confirmed by FISH or RT -PCR analyses. 4. ETV6 -RUNX1 fusion ETV6 -RUNX1 fusion cannot be d etected by chromosome banding and hence FISH and/or RT -PCR must be used to detect this banding, FISH and RT -PCR analyses are frequently used to detect these chromosomal translocati on / gene fusions with varying degrees of accuracy. False negative and positive results have been reported for all techniques for all gene fusions. FISH is considered sufficient to detect the presence of any one of these three gene fusions. It is best prac tice to confirm a positive BCR -ABL1 result with a second technique. Chromosome banding alone cannot be used to confirm or exclude the presence any one of these three gene fusions. 6. ABL of choice to detect rearrangements of these genes is FISH analysis. It should be emphasized that the CSF1R and PDGFRB genes are located only 500 bp apart in 5q32; thus, rearrangements of these two genes cannot easily be distinguished by FISH. It is not compulsory to identify the partner genes, but such information is important to collect in order to ascertain the prognos tic effect of the different fusion transcripts. Please note that ABL -class fusions have been reported in T-ALL, albeit rarely, and that hence T -ALL should be included in the screening strategy for these abnormalities. In addition, HeH cases should be scree ned for ABL - class fusions. 7. Copy number alterations Copy number alterations will be used in conjunction with MRD and genetics to classify IR patients into the IR -low and IR -high subgroups (Figure 2, Table 2). B -cell precursor patients with a good risk CNA profile as defined by the UKALL CNA classifier [1, 129] who also have a good MRD response post -induction (<0.05%) will be eligible for inclusion in the IR -low subgroup. Note that the UKALL CNA classifier does apply to T -ALL patients. The UKALL CNA classifier is based on the deletion profile of eight loci. Copy number alterations, including deletions, can be detected using a genome wide array platform ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 322 (e.g. SNP -A or array CGH) or MLPA (using the SALSA P335 kit, MRC Holland). If using a validated MLPA, SNP array or array CGH assay then deletions do NOT need to be confirmed by a separate technique. The UKALL CNA classifier was developed using copy number data generated from MLPA and according to specific criteria. (Tables 5 and 6). To ensu re that the integrity of the classifier is maintained prospectively, it is important that genetic laboratories use the same criteria for calling individual CNA and thereafter the CNA profile. If the UKALL CNA profile is being called using SNP array or ar ray CGH data then additional conditions must be considered. SNP arrays have a much greater genomic coverage and some are able to detect CNA present in low level clones (<20%). Hence it is conceivable that arrays could detect deletions that are undetectable by MLPA due to the locations of the probes and, therefore, were not considered during the development of the UKALL CNA classifier. However, SNP array data [126] were used to inform the location of the MLPA probes in the P335 kit so it is likely that the number of deletions undetectable by MLPA will be small. We have recently analyzed SNP array and MLPA data from a total of 240 B -other ALL cases using -house bioinformatic pipeline analysis while the Illumina arrays were analyzed in a clinical diagnostic setting. Neither array identified any deletion affecting these eight genes/loci that was undetectable by MLPA. However, there were seven deletions affecting ETV6 (n=4), PAX5 (n=2) and IKZF1 (n=1) which although detected by MLPA resulted in the loss of just one MLPA probe; so would not have been called as deletions for the purposes of the UKALL CNA classifier (Table 5). Hence, genetic laboratories using SNP arrays or aCGH to determine copy number status for the ALLTogether trial must be aware of the criteria used for calling the UKALL CNA profile (Tables 5 and 6). Obviously, it is important to report all copy number alterations accurately as well as providing clear advice for risk stratification. Therefore, we recommend that laboratories report each individual CNA along with the exons deleted (e.g. IKZF1 deletion (exons 4 -7), PAX5 deletion (whole gene), ETV6 deletion (exons 1 -3), etc.) as well as a clear statement stating whether or not the deletion pattern observed is consistent with a GR or PR UKALL CNA profile. In short we recommend that: All genetic lab oratories take part in an appropriate external QA scheme. Laboratories use an appropriate test or tests to detect, and if necessary, confirm the presence of the genetic abnormalities (Table 1) that will be used to risk stratify patients in this trial. o We strongly recommend the use of genomic arrays to detect ploidy groups and copy number alterations; along with FISH and RT -PCR to detect gene fusions. Laboratories take reasonable steps to ensure the sample contains a sufficient percentage of leukemic cells to make the test valid. If not, negative results should be reported with appropriate qualification.

Near -haploidy NH Clones with fewer than 30 chromosomes Doubled -up sub -clones which have 48 -58 chromosomes will be included in the subgroup. Low hypodiploidy HoL Clones with 30 -39 chromosomes Doubled -up sub -clones whose karyotypes have 60 -78 chromosomes (i.e. near -triploidy) will be included in the subgroup. Intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 iAMP21 Three or more extra copies of a FISH probe to the RUNX1 gene on a single abnormal chromosome 21 iAMP21 can be defined using a DNA fusions Any genetic rearrangement that results in the fusion of a variable 5' partner gene with the 3' portion of ABL1, ABL2, PDGFRB and CSF1R. Numerous partner genes have been descri bed. The most frequent are EBF1 and ETV6. Patients with BCR-ABL1 fusion are excluded from this subgroup and from the protocol. Identification of the partner gene is not required for classification.

ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 324 Figure 1: Threshold analysis was used to determine the most discriminatory MRD threshold. Panel A shows an example of the graph generated. Panel B details the different optimum MRD thresholds for the genetic subgroups. Panel A - An example of threshold analysis. Graph A shows the risk of relapse plotted against unique MRD thresholds. The blue/black circles show the risk of relapse for all patients with an MRD value more/less than that specific MRD threshold. The greater the separation of the two lines the greater discriminatory potential of the threshold. Graph B shows the number of patients with MRD greater (blue)/less (black) than the MRD threshold. The threshold when the two lines cross indicates the mid -point of the c ohort (i.e. the threshold that splits the cohort 50:50). Potential MRD thresholds are assessed by visually inspecting both plots to determine the threshold with the greatest discriminatory potential subject to group size. As the survival probabilities esti mated above are 5 year estimates, these thresholds were validated through log rank tests looking for a difference in the overall survival distribution, and considering the magnitude of the corresponding test statistics (Graph C). To avoid inflation of Type I error's, the p -values were adjusted. ROC curves (Graph D) were then used to assess the probabilities of the sensitivity and specificity ensuring sufficient discriminatory strength.

Because SNP -A also identifies uniparental isodisomies, it is considered superior to array -CGH for identifying duplicated NH/HoL clones, which may be misinterpreted as HeH. SNP-A and array -CGH are considered sufficient to both detect and refute the presence of ploidy shifts, iAMP21, and gene deletions. b RT-PCR can be used to both detect and refute the presence of the fusion genes BCR -ABL1 (positive cases are excluded indicate the positive BCR -ABL1 results are confirmed by a second technique. c MLPA with a commercially available probe mix is considered sufficient to both detect and refute the presence of deletions. d Southern blot analysis, using three restriction digests, is sufficient to both detect and refute the presence of KMT2A -r. e Chromosome banding analysis may be used to identify ploidy groups. However, in case of a normal karyotype or karyotypic failure, the presence of these ploidy groups must be screened for by alternative methods (SNP -A or array or RT -PCR analyses. Chromosome banding analysis is not compulsory in the ALLTogether protocol, but cells should always be cultured for analysis a nd then stored in fixative. This will enable subsequent analysis in cases where, for example, FISH signal patterns are difficult to interpret. A chromosomal abnorm ality must be present in at least 2 metaphases (3 metaphases for a monosomy) to be considered clonal. A normal karyotype requires the full analysis of a minimum of 20 metaphases. (See ISCN 2016, p85) f Interphase FISH can be used to detect fusion genes and rearrangements involving KMT2A (KMT2A -r) and the ABL -class genes (it is not compulsory to id entify the partner genes). Interphase FISH with a probe for RUNX1 can be used to screen for iAMP21; however, if interphase FISH analysis suggests the presence of iAMP21, this must be confirmed by metaphase FISH analysis to verify that the extra RUNX1 signa ls are located on one abnormal chromosome 21. FISH is considered sufficient to detect the presence of iAMP21, ABL -class and KMT2A -r, and gene fusions. g Although several next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, such as whole genome sequencing, whole ex ome sequencing, and RNA/transcriptome sequencing, are increasingly being applied in research, NGS is, at present, not considered properly validated for clinical routine diagnostic s in most laboratories. Although this may change in the near future, for the time being, NGS analyses may be offered by some \"core\" diagnostic centers and used, for example, to identify ABL -class and KMT2A fusion partners. h Approximately cases should be grouped according to the fusion present and not as HeH.

Marquart SPONSOR: Karolinska University Hospital CHIEF INVESTIGATOR MD PhD Mats Heyman VERSION number: FINAL Version 1.0 RELEASE DATE: 5 August 2019 ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 332 Background The treatment stratifications in the ALLtogether protocol are based on algorithms that include measurable residual disease (MRD). The primary method for MRD measurement is allele -specific polymerase -chain reaction (ASO -PCR). High sensitivity multicolour flow cytometry (Next Generation Flow, NGF) is a complementary a pproach and is used parallel to ASO -PCR. NGF will provide information of the cell distribution in the bone marrow sample (control of sample quality). The detection of MRD by Flow cytometry (FCM) is based on the detection of leukaemia -associated immunophenotypes (LAIP) that are not or at low frequencies present on normal hematopoietic cells. MRD measured by FCM is prognostic in childhood B -ALL FCM -MRD [23] and approaches a sensitivity comparable to PCR - MRD provided a high cell -count analysis is performed [121] . FCM -MRD was used for risk stratification patients with BCP -ALL in NOPHO protocols [177] obtaining s urvival outcomes equivalent to those in protocols chain (IGH) rearrangements is the gold standard for MRD monitoring in T -ALL. FCM is the alternative method to detect MRD by identifying aberrant antigen expression. FCM based MRD detection i n T-ALL is performed in some centres in parallel with allele - specific PCR because a clonal rearrangement or a sensitive PCR marker cannot be found in all patients. FCM -MRD as a risk stratification tool in T -ALL was evaluated in the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol. Although patients were stratified by PCR when sufficiently sensitive and specific PCR markers were available at diagnosis, FCM -MRD was performed on all samples [179] . After a cent ralized review of the MRD data, it was shown that FCM -MRD provides reliable risk prediction in T -ALL and can be used for stratification when no PCR -marker is available in a multi -centre setting. Indeed, patients with MRD > 0.1 % on day 29 after first induction had a significantly worse EFS and OS compared to patients with MRD <0.1%. Using a cut -off of 0.1% MRD at day 29 after first induction allows the allocation of T -ALL patients to the intermediate risk group without an i ncreased rate of relapse. Future studies are, however, needed to determine whether the sensitivity and accuracy of FCM -MRD in T -ALL can be improved. The ALLTogether T -ALL and ETP -ALL combinations are based on former NOPHO ALL2008 protocol panels. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 333 Evaluat ion of BM -MRD The analysis must be performed as stipulated in the ALLtogether study protocol. Bone marrow samples for MRD analysis will be taken on day15 and day29 after induction and on day71 at the start of consolidation 2. Additional samples will be tak en in High Risk (HR) patients after each HR -block until MRD negative. Day29 and day71 are the stratifying time points, called hereafter TP1 and TP2, respectively. The samples at TP1 and TP2 are analysed by PCR and FCM samples analysed by FCM, only. The day15 samples are analysed to identify marker modulation, to assess the validity of FCM -MRD and to monitor the initial treatment response. In addition, the day15 response will be explored as a future potential prognostic marker, since i t has been used to stratify patients by several study groups. Specimen At diagnosis, either bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood samples can be used for the detection of PCR targets and immunophenotyping the leukaemia. The MRD follow -up analysis is always performed on a bone marrow sample from the first pull of the first aspirate according to the \"ALLTogether BM sampling guidelines\". Both Heparin - or EDTA -coagulated samples are allowed. Aliquots from same sample should be used for both FCM and PCR to ensure comparability of results. It is recommended that the sample is processed within 24 hours after collection. Sample processing Mononuclear cells prepared by Ficoll -density gradient are used for PCR -MRD. A lyse, stain and wash method needs to be used for the FCM -MRD at the stratifying TPs to ensure the analysis of a sufficient number of cells (see special issues FCM - MRD). Bulk lysis can be performed using any kind of NH 4CL lysing buffer. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 334 A stain, lyse and wash method can be used for the day1 5 FCM -MRD. Immunophenotyping at diagnosis A comprehensive antibody panel needs to be applied for a complete characterization of the leukemic cells according to the W.H.O. 2016 classification of ALL and MPAL. One can use any validated panel as long as it includes the markers listed in the diagnosti c ALLTogether panel (Table 1: Mandatory and optional markers to be applied at diagnosis of the leukaemia for the childhood ALLTogether study). Immunophenotyping at diagnosis may be performed in the local diagnostic laboratories. Bone marrow aspirates or pe ripheral blood can be used for the diagnostic immunophenotyping. It is mandatory to analyse the diagnostic sample with the respective standard combinations for MRD analysis of BCP, T -ALL or ETP -ALL using the same antibody clones and conjugates. The reco mmended antibody volumes, that will be provided, should be used. It is recommended to analyse the multiplex antibodies (e.g. CD66c - / CD304 in BCP panel) [180-184] separately to be able to predict treatment related marker modulation. Diagnostic FCM data collected at local centres are forwarded to the respective FCM - MRD laboratories for reporting in the ALLTogether MRD database. Detection levels by FCM MRD Definition of Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) (reproducible sensitivity) and sensitivity / Lower limit of Detection (LOD) of MRD -FCM [121] : A lower -Associated 10e-5 when based on minim um of 4 million living events excluding erythropoiesis) A lower limit of detection/LOD requires minimum 10 LAIP events (positive<10e- 5 when based on minimum of 4 million living events excluding erythropoiesis) MRD -FCM equivalent of PCR -MRD positive < QR i s defined as 10 -39 clustered events detected. MRD -FCM equivalent of MRD -PCR -detectable (avoid \"negativity\") is defined as <10 clustered LAIP detected following acquisition of a minimum of 4 million living events excluding erythropoiesis. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 335 Definition of undetectable MRD - (threshold for VLR -stratification) by FCM: Less than 10 clustered LAIP events are detected following acquisition of a minimum of 4 million total events. Note that MRD negative/undetectable cannot be determined by FCM -MRD in T-ALL patients. by PCR: No positive signal is detected in any of three 600ng patient DNA replicate samples per target with at least one target with a minimum QR of 1x10-4. Ideally, two targets are analysed, one with QR of 1x10-4, the other with QR of 5x10-4 but if there is only one suitable target, patients can still be allocated to the SR arm in the absence of a positive signal. Definition and requirements of cut -offs for HR -stratification by FCM: Informative immunophenotype (Stratification to the HR -group by FCM is acceptable as long as the markers used are informative (adequate LAIP). by PCR: Lower sensitivity targets may be used, since this will not change the stratification to HR MRD 5% at TP1 MRD 5x10-4 for IR -low stratification by FCM: Sensitivity of 5x10-4 with an adequate LAIP for BCP -ALL. Note that It is not possible to allocate T -ALL patients to IR -low by FCM -MRD. by PCR: For BC P-patients: One target with a reproducible sensitivity of 5x10-4 is required. For T -cell patients: MRD undetectable at TP2 if T -cell ALL ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 336 Definition of genetic work -up relevant for MRD labs: Patients with B -ALL positive for t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), BCR -ABL1 by FISH and/or RT - PCR are ineligible for the trial. The mandatory HR -genetic markers to be determined at diagnosis ETV6 -RUNX1 )and t(1;19)(q23;p13), TCF3 -PBX1 is mutual exclusive with HR genetics. Thus, testing for HR genetics is not needed. Special issues in relation to Flow MRD FCM -MRD will be used for stratification when two sensitive PCR -MRD markers are not available. T-ALL patients cannot be allocated to SRR or IR -L by any FCM MRD method at the moment. Definition of failed MRD -stratification : When the MRD analysis cannot be performed due to lack of a sample or the MRD result may be compromised because of technical issues during the analysis, patients cannot be stratified to IR -low or SR groups (see above). Likewise, it is not feasible to apply MRD based risk stratification when the detection level doesn't meet the criteria for stratification in the specific genetic subgrou ps e.g. only partially informative LAIP and a QR < 5 x 10-4. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 337 Antibody panel used in follow -up samples The MRD panels for BCP -ALL, T -ALL and ETP -ALL differ depending on the flow cytometer platform in use (Navios or FACSCanto/FACSLyric). Refer to Addendum 1. In the case BCP FCM MRD, the BCP -ALL-MRD kit from Cytognos (7 colour with PE drop in) are to be used adding PE -conjugated antibodies as listed for the detection of the LAIPs (Addendum 1). MRD panels for FCM -MRD of patients with KMT2A gene fusions will be developed. The standard MRD antibody combination(s) allowing the detection of the LAIPs are analysed on all follow -up samples. Two MRD combinations are preferably used for the MRD analysis of BCP and 2 to 3 of T -ALL, provided the samp le has an adequate cell count (see below). Adjustment of the standard antibody combinations is not allowed. A Syto dye or an alternative cell viability marker should not be used for calculation of total viable events excluding erythropoiesis (as defined underneath \"Initial gating strategy\") If only one of the standard tube combinations reveals the LAIP, the informative antibody combination should be run twice (data should not be merged during analyses because the sensitivity should not be increased additionally, but only used as technical backup). Instrument setup and fluorescence compensation Instrument set -up for FacsCanto / Lyric (BD Biosciences) and Navios (Beckman Coulter) is performed according to the respective standard operating procedures outlined by Euroflow ( www.euroflow.org ) using Rainbow beads and target of 7th peak [185] . Because Rainbow beads target values are not available for the FACSLyric instrument s it is recommended to use CST PMT target values until specific target values will be outlined on the EuroMRD homepage. Sample preparation and staining The staining procedure may differ dependent on the time point in the protocol. Sample at diagnosis : staining can be performed after or before RBC lysing according to lab's preference. Ficoll can be used according to local preference. Samples at day15, TP1 and TP2, and beyond : staining is performed on the recommended number of cells (see below) after bulk lysis. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 338 Bulk lysis of the sample is performed using NH 4CL as described ( Addendum 2). Commercially available reagent such as Pharmlyse or BulkLysis solution or an in - house ammonium chloride solution can be used. The staining is performed according to standard operating procedures. Briefly, the respective antibody tubes are prepared with the pre -titrated and diluted antibodies to which 100 microliter of cell suspension is added. The cells are incubated during 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature and washed once using PBS. The stained cells are kept in the dark and at 4oC until acquisition on the flow cytometer not later than 4 hours after staining. It is imperative to perform a cell count before preparation. Adjust the cell count according to th e following guidelines: Diagnostic samples: 100 microliter bone marrow and blood or mononuclear cell suspension containing 0.5 million cells/mL in order to be able to acquire 100.000 cells per tube. MRD day15 samples: it is advised to prepare a cell sus pension of 1 -2 million cells/ mL after bulk lysis in order to be able to acquire a minimum of 500.000 cells per tube. MRD follow -up: Prepare a cell suspension of 80 -100 million cells/mL after bulk lysis in order to be able to acquire 4 -5 million cells per tube. Do not add more cells per tube because it is not the aim to reach a higher level of detection since it will alter the threshold for the standard risk (SR) arm / no detectable MRD. If there are < 10 x 106 cells before bulk lysis, use these cells for the most informative antibody combination. If only one standard antibody combination is informative, it needs to be analysed twice. Do not adjust the standard antibody combinations unless deemed inadequate for MRD analysis. If adjustment is needed, follow the guidelines for BCP (preB -ALL) alternative markers (drop in PE channel markers) and T - ALL alternative antibody combinations. Sample acquisition Diagnostic samples: Acquire 100.000 total cells (in order to detect heterogeneous antigen expression pattern and subpopulations) Day 15 samples : Acquire preferably up to 1 million events per MRD antibody combination (to assess possible early treatment -related marker modulat ion and to able ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 339 to explore day15 response as a future prognostic marker). It is recommended to run 2 to 3 FCM MRD antibody combinations on day 15 in order to select the two most informative marker combinations that will be analysed on the day 29 sample (TP 1). TP1 and TP2 and beyond : Acquire preferably up to 5 million events (but max 6 million events in total), to obtain 4 -5 million living events excluding erythropoiesis for data analyses (max 5 million viable evets at TP1 and max 6 million viable events at TP2 are to be analysed in order not to reach a higher level of detection). If between 10 -20 million cells are available after bulk lysis, make sure that 5 million events (4 mill living events excluding erythropoiesis) are acquired for the most informativ e antibody combination and as many as possible for the second antibody combination. If less than 8 -10 million cells are available allowing staining with one antibody combination, acquire 5 -6 million events. If cells are acquired until the tube is empty, t he time parameter can be included to gate out events generated by air bubbles. Data analysis Data analysis is performed using the software programs available in the laboratory (Infinicyt TM, Kaluza TM, FACSuit TM or any other software program which can d isplay at least 5 million events). The standard dot -plots and the gating strategy is described below. Initial gating strategy for BCP and T -ALL LAIPs of leukemic BCP and T -ALL blasts are detected in the so -called 'empty spaces' in two -dimensional dot plot s of a combination of B - or T-cell markers from the respective ALLtogether panels [186, 187] . Each MRD lab is advised to compile normal reference images by analysing normal and regenerative bone marrow samples [188] . Firstly, dead cells/debris and doublets are removed using the dot plots FSC/SSC and FSC Area/FSC Height. Secondly erythropoiesis BCP-ALL or CD45negative / CD7negative events in T -ALL are removed using CD45/CD19 or CD45/CD7 dotplots. The remaining events are defined as living leukocytes excluding erythroid cells and debris and is named \"living event excluding e rythropoiesis\". ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 340 Persistence of spurious signals due remaining debris or precipitates should only be removed in dot -plots, where the blasts are most likely to be positive in only one of the two markers (and not double positive) The linage markers (CD19 posi tive events in BCP and CD7 in T -ALL) are used as primary gating marker and selected on the CD45/linage -marker and/or linage -marker/SSC dot plots depending on the expression level of CD45 and the lineage markers (CD19/CD7) If the expression of the lineage m arker is weak at time of diagnosis, or the expression of the lineage marker may be masked due to antibody treatment (e.g. Blinatumomab (anti -CD19) or CAR -T cell therapy), an alternative lineage marker should be used (e.g. CD22 and CD24 in case of Blinatumo mab treatment). Thirdly, the lineage -specific events are examined in contour -plots or dot -plots and compared to the reference images or drawn regions from the day 0 analysis but importantly, known marker modulation should be taken into account. All \"empty spaces\" are reviewed for possible leukemic events and delineated by a gate. If the leukemic cells exhibit heterogeneous antigen expression profiles at the time of diagnosis i.e. if they are comprised of several subpopulations (bimodal marker expression), all subpopulations need to be reviewed for the presence of LAIPs. It is recommended to use a sequential gating strategy starting from a wide gate to include all possible aberrant and CD45 positive events (note that BCPs can be CD45neg) and gradually remov e the events from normal mature and immature cells to finish with gating of events corresponding to LAIP. (Note that both BCP and T -ALL can up -regulate CD45 during treatment to levels such as mature lymphocytes). To further verify the LAIP events, back -gate on CD45/SSC and/or FSC/SSC plots keeping in mind that CD45 expression has often increased during treatment. > 10 events fulfilling the LAIP criteria are to be reported. A cluster of > 40 events with a leukemic phenotype is considered as quantitative minimal residual disease. MRD is calculated as % LAIP of all living events excluding erythropoiesis. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 341 Non-malignant cell population to be identified and reported in the answer to the clinician / in the study DB (calculated in % of living cells): Normal CD34pos cells in BCP and in (CD10neg/CD20bright) c.

In T-ALLs: CD3pos/CD45bright) Data reporting ALLTogether FCM MRD labs are responsible for reporting the results on the diagnostic sample and for reporting the MRD result. Reporting of the data is done in the study database. At diagnosis, the following data are reported [modified from [189] ]: the complete phenotype of the leukemic blasts as well as a description of the LAIP used for MRD analyses. The Bethesda guidelines should be used when reporting a marker expression. The following categories of markers will be reporte d for the major leukemic cell population depending on the ALL lineage and critical use of the marker (indicated in Table I): (a) CD45 342 In case of ETP -ALL: % of blasts positive for CD5, CD34, CD117, HLA -DR etc will be reported in order to substantiate the ETP classification [190, 191] . Finally, the number of LAIP is recorded for each of the standard antibody tubes that are analysed. For the MRD samples, the level of residual leukemic cells as well as their phenotype is reported. Residual leukemic cells are quantified as percentage of Total living events excluding erythropoiesis If the levels of MRD differ between the antibody tubes, the highest level of MRD is the result used for clinical decision. The data files of all samples will be submitted to a study server to be used for twin -lab and central review. Twin -lab function For T -ALLs the data files of the diagnostic samples as well as of the follow -up samples will be evaluated by 2 independent laboratories (Twin -lab). If no consensus on the MRD level is reached, the expertise of a member of the ALLTogether coordinator group will be sought. A consensus result will be reported on -line to the study database and to the clinician treating the patient. In difficult cases of BCP -ALLs the Twin -lab function can always be activated. Quality Control (QC) in relation to MRD Laboratories performing MRD should be ISO accredited. FCM MRD laboratories are required to participate in the following QC programs: 1. The Euroflow QA program: QC of ALL FC M-MRD program: QC of staining and analysis using diagnostic BM samples diluted in peripheral blood. 3. The ALLTogether QC program: QC of analysis using FCM data files from the study database; one T -ALL and one B -ALL 4. Mandatory QC meetings linked to EuroFlow mandatory QC -meetings within the participation organizations ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 343 Research/developments Developments in technology are encouraged. However, to be adopted for real time use to risk -stratify patients they must show i) equivalent performance to current technology (stats help may be required in assessing this) and ii) rationale for adoption - e.g. wider applicability, reduced cost, increased accuracy. Changes need to be approved by the ALLTogether MRD working group. Local research developments (e.g. test ing new targets and new / alternative fluorochromes) are welcome. However, we should meet to discuss collaborative research priorities and how to progress these. One important purpose of the ALLTogether MRD group is to act as a platform for collaborative r esearch. The ALLTogether FCM MRD group is planning the development of one 10C BCP panel and a 10C T -ALL panel (further developed from the 9C BD T -ALL panel) for BD - instruments because post induction samples (TP1) may not contain enough cells to reach a de tection level of 10 -5 in a 2 -tube analysis. The different FCM MRD panels will be regularly validated and FCM - MRD results of the different panels and generated on the different platforms will be compared to the PCR -MRD results. Platforms used in this protocol include Navios (Beckman Coulter), FacsCa nto and Lyric (BD Biosciences).

ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 355 Addendum 4 Additional information on FCM -MRD BCP -ALL EuroFlow consortium has defined a combination of antibodies suitable for MRD detection in BCP -ALL divided in CD10, CD66c, CD123, CD73 and CD304 have been selected because of their frequent abnormal expression in BCP - ALL. CD66c expression is associated with BCP -ALL Philadelphia chromosome and hype rdiploid BCR -ALL [180, 181] and is therefore, an important diagnostic and prognostic marker. Likewise, CD123 expression is also marker of hyperdiploid BCP - ALL BCP -ALL patients [183, 18 4]. In combination with the backbone markers, CD81 and CD38 were selected because of its better separation capacity between normal and BCP -ALL cells [121] . Additional well -known aberrant be added in the PE drop -in chanale (listed in Addendum 1: ALLTogether antibody panels). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 356 Addendum 5 Additional information on FCM -MRD T -ALL The analysis of T -cell-lineage and immaturity antigens allows the identification of T - cells with an immature, thymocyte -like T -cell phenotype in BM (or relevant aberrant phenotypes in T -ALL include the following: Expression of cytoplasmic CD3 and absence of surface CD3 expression Expression of on -DR). Distinct LAIP subpopulations with heterogeneous expression of one or more LAIP marker(s) in diagnostic BM samples from T -ALL patients is common and should be taken into consideration during MRD follow -up. In addition, similar to B lymphoblastic leukaemia, treatment -related marker modulation or loss of a positive subpopulation may occur, which might be attributed to clonal evolution or blast subpopulations with diverse chemotherapy sensitivities. A standard 8 - or 9-colour combination antibody panel has been designed for the T -ALL FCM -MRD analysis on FacsCanto/FacsLyric and a 10 -color antibody panel on Navios (Addendum 1). The MRD antibody combinations are aimed at the detection of LAIP on the leukemic blasts of the major T -ALL disease entities. CD45, CD7, CD3, CD4 and CD8 comprise the backbone markers of the 8 -colour combination panel, whereas CD16/CD56 was added as a sixth backbone marker in the 9 - and 10 -colour combination panel in order to unequivocally identify NK -cells often showing CD7bright and CD45dim expression s imilar to many T -ALL blasts. By using these backbone markers gating of the leukemic blasts is feasible in the majority of T -ALL cases. Two separate MRD antibody combinations are designed for the detection of LAIP on the leukemic blasts in Early T -cell (ETP -ALL is diagnosed in 11% of childhood leukaemia and is characterized by the expression of at least one or more of the following stem -cell or myeloid markers CD34, CD117, HLA -DR, CD13, CD33, CD11b, or CD 65 in addition to dim expression of CD5 and CD1a and CD8 negativity [190, Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 357 T-lymphoblasts can most often be distinguished from mature T -cells by the absence of surface (s)/membranous (m)CD3 and dim/normal expression of cytoplasmic CD3 expression at the time of diagnosis. At the MRD timepoints, leukemic blasts can be identified within the CD7 positive cells by cyt -CD3 expression while negat ive for sCD3 -cell markers including CD45 high/CD56and CD16 pos. LAIP is determined on the major leukemic cell populations present in the diagnostic sample [5: Supplementary Methods S1, FCM data analysis and gating strategy]. The major leuk emic blast population is defined on a CD45 or CD7 versus side scatter (SSC) dot-plot or CD7 versus CD45 dot -plot depending on the expression level of CD7. Subsequently, the leukemic blast population is further characterized by the expression of the backbon e markers CD3, CD4 and CD8 in addition antigens. of CD4, CD8 and mCD3 together with CD7/CD45 of the leukemic blasts finally determine the gating strategy to be used for MRD evaluation in the follow -up samples. The majority of T lymphoblasts can be identified by the expression of CD7 and/or CD45 at diagnosis. If CD7 is dim expressed, cytCD3 may be used for primary gating strategy. Note that cytCD3 is present in 1 of the standard MRD antibody tubes but technical challenges in relat ion to intracellular staining procedures mean that analysis results from marker combinations with only membrane markers are taken for the most valid. Next, the expression of the non -backbone markers is evaluated for each of the major leukemic blast popu lations in order to identify LAIP. In this respect, the three major reference populations for leukemic blasts include the CD7pos/mCD3neg/dim, mCD3/cytCD3, CD4/CD8 characteristic expression (including double positive/negative) or CD7pos/CD56 -16neg cells. Data analysis for the screening of residual leukemic cells in follow -up samples is performed according to the gating strategy identified for the leukemic blasts in the diagnostic sample. A cluster of > 40 events with a leukemic phenotype is considered as quantitative minimal residual disease. In addition, a standardized gating strategy for the mature normal T -cell populations (CD7pos, mCD3pos, CD4 CD16/CD56pos) should be included. Known lation should be taken into account [192] . In relation to ETP the normal CD34 positive cells and normal myeloid precursors (CD34pos/CD117/CD13 - 33pos/HLA -DRpos/CD5neg but occasionally CD7dim be [190, 191]. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 358 29.3 Laboratory Guideline s for ALLTogether Molecular MRD STUDY: ALLTogether EUDRACT -001795 -38 DEVELOPMENT PHASE III DOCUMENT TYPE: Laboratory Study Protocol Guidelines NAME OF GUIDELINE: Laboratory Guidelines for ALLTogether Molecular MRD SOP AUTHOR/S: John Moppett and Jeremy Hancock SPONSOR: Karolinska University Hospital CHIEF INVESTIGATOR MD PhD Mats Heyman VERSION number: FINAL Version 1.0 (based on version 4.1 June 2019) RELEASE DATE: 5 August 2019 ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 359 This SOP assumes a high degree of competence, knowledge and experience in the collaborating MRD laboratories. The RQ -PCR methodology used is based on European best practice and is subject to rigorous ongoing external quality assurance provided by EuroMRD. This SOP is intended to highlight the additional requirements for the provision of molecular M RD analysis for ALLTogether and to supplement local SOPs already in existence. All analysis and interpretation of all RQ -PCR data should be undertaken in accordance with EuroMRD guidelines. [117] This SOP is based around the chapter written by Vincent van der Velden for the EuroMRD book entitled MRD detection in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients using Ig/TCR gene rearrangements as targets for real -time quantitative PCR . BONE MARROW SAMPLE PROCESSING AT DIAGNOSIS A volume of 3 - 5ml of bone marrow (BM), collected at the time of diagnosis in a 10ml ACD, EDTA or heparin vacutainer, should be subjected to density centrifugation to obtain the mononuclear cells (MNC ). In the absence of marrow, and in cases where the blast percentage in the peripheral blood is > 20%, a 5 - 10ml sample of blood is an acceptable alternative. The use of samples with lower blast counts should not be used as this will hamper the detection of Ig/TCR rearrangements. The percentage of ALL blast cells in the MNC fraction should be asse ssed by flow cytometric immunophenotyping (see Appendix 1 for protocol). This blast count should be used for the correction of the tumour load in the creation of the patient -specific logarithmic dilution series (see below). For patients with an inaspira ble bone marrow, a trephine sample stored in saline solution is an acceptable alternative at diagnosis. On such occasions, it is important to obtain information regarding the blast % in the sample from the referring clinical centre to ensure that the pati ent-specific logarithmic dilution series is created as accurately as possible (see below). BONE MARROW SAMPLE FOR MRD ANALYSIS A volume of 3 - 5ml of bone marrow (BM), taken at the respective MRD sampling time -points should be collected in a 10ml ACD, ED TA or heparin vacutainer and subjected to Ficoll density centrifugation to obtain the mononuclear cells (MNC). It is important that the first bone marrow aspirate is used for MRD analysis as there is a high probability of subsequent aspirations being dil uted with peripheral blood. In contrast to diagnosis, peripheral blood or the use of trephines do not represent an acceptable alternative for MRD analysis and should not be used under any circumstances. DNA EXTRACTION For reasons of standardization and prediction of DNA recovery, a fixed number of 5 x 106 MNC should be used for DNA extraction. However, it is possible to perform MRD analysis on <5 x 106 cells. Therefore, labs are encouraged to extract DNA from cell numbers between 2 and 5 x106 cells an d to base eligibility for analysis on the DNA yield obtained. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 360 Clinical centres should be contacted and a request for a repeat sample should be made for patient samples where <5 x 106 cells have been recovered. This request for an additional sample should be cancelled if sufficient DNA has been recovered for yields between 2 and 5 x 106 cells. It is recommended that DNA is extracted using either the QIAamp\u00ae DNA MiniKit or QIAamp\u00ae DNA Blood Mini Kit DNA extraction systems according to the manufacturers protocol. These provide fast and easy methods for purification of total DNA for reliable PCR and RQ -PCR. Phenol -chloroform -based extraction methods should be avoided since this procedure results in the production of high molecular weight DNA which is very hard to pipette in a reproducible way. Extraction of DNA from 5 x 106 MNC will generally result in 10 to 20 g of DNA, which is sufficient for screening of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements and the preparation of a patient -specific logarithmic dilution series. As outlined below, the concentration of amplifiable DNA in the stock solution should be determined using either a control gene RQ -PCR (e.g. albumin) or by spectrophotometric absorbance -based quantification using a Nanodrop. Working solutions of diagnosti c and follow -up samples should be prepared in sterile water (e.g. Milli -Q water). A working dilution of the diagnostic DNA should be prepared at a concentration of between 60 - 120ng/\u00b5l. This working solution is used for PCR analysis and for the creatio n of patient dilution series. Working dilutions for the follow -up samples should be created. For RQ -PCR, the concentration of these working dilutions should range from 60 - 120ng/\u00b5l according to local preferences. These working dilution and stock solu tions should be at 4\u00b0C (or -20\u00b0C) for short periods of time (<3 months) and for longer term storage, preferably at -80\u00b0C. CELL BANKING Where this option is available, it is recommended that residual cells not required for MRD are stored for future studies. Cells should be frozen in aliquots of varying cell concentrations between 2 and 50 x 106/ml in 90% FCS and 10% DMSO and stored long-term in liquid nitrogen vapour phase. Where long established local approaches for storage of live cells already e xist it is perfectly acceptable that these are followed. CONTROL GENE REAL -TIME QUANTITATIVE PCR It is recommended that a control gene RQ PCR is set up in order to accurately determine the biological activity of each diagnostic sample that is to be used for the creation of a patient -specific dilution series. It is thus simultaneously a check for: accuracy of DNA quantitation accuracy of pipetting presence of PCR inhibitors This SOP does not dictate which control gene assay should be used. Rather, it is important that the control gene assay used is subject to ongoing quality assurance through contin uing participation in EuroMRD QC rounds. Primer and probe sequences for the control genes in use by the ALLTogether MRD group are shown in Appendix 2. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 361 Samples should be analysed using a dilution series created from normal DNA diluted in sterile water (e .g. Milli -Q water). The source of the normal DNA used for this dilution series can be either pooled normal donor MNC DNA (> 5 healthy individuals are required) or that purchased from a commercial company (e.g. Roche Human Genomic DNA). The dilution point s included in the dilution series should be determined according to local preferences. However, it is essential that the dilution series has at least 3 dilution points and has a quantitative range that covers the expected concentrations of the samples bei ng analysed. The criteria for an acceptable control gene RQ PCR are as follows: Slope = -3.1 to -3.9 Correlation (R2) >0.98 Minimal variation in CT between replicates of the unknown samples <0.5 Where labs have good evidence of the relative performance of spectrophotometric absorbance -based quantification using a Nanodrop, this can be used as a viable alternative to RQ -PCR for the assessment of concentration. CREATION OF A PATIENT -SPECIFIC DILUTION SERIES Standard curves for the assessment of primer sensitivity and quantitation of MRD are derived from the amplification of a logarithmic dilution series of diagnostic DNA. Diagnostic DNA should be diluted into pooled normal donor MNC DNA (> 5 healthy individuals are required to limit the potential for sk ewed Ig/TCR repertoire). Stocks of normal donor MNC DNA should be prepared at a concentration of between 60 - 120ng/ l according to local preferences to match those of the stock concentrations of the diagnostic DNA. The example included below is based on the assumption that the concentration of the normal donor DNA and diagnostic DNA used is 100ng/\u00b5l. The integrity of template DNA and the accuracy with which dilution curves are made are critical to the success of quantitative analysis. The patient -specific dilution series should cover -01 point should take into account the concen tration of the diagnostic DNA as measured by an albumin control gene RQ -PCR or by measurement on a Nanodrop and the blast count determined by flow cytometry following Ficoll density centrifugation. E.g. To create 100\u00b5l of the 1E -01 dilution point, 11.1\u00b5l of diagnostic DNA with a concentration of 120ng/\u00b5l and a blast count of 75% should be diluted in 89.9\u00b5l of stock normal donor mononuclear cell solution at 100ng/\u00b5l. Additional dilution points are included in the dilution series to reflect the different clinical thresholds used for ALLTogether. For example, for patients confirmed as being HeH, the clinical threshold is 3E -04. It is recommended that the 3E - 04 dilution point is created at the same time as the rest of the dilution series for all patients. Similarly, it is recognised that it is easier for laboratories to include this dilution point in all RQ -PCR assays rather than solely for those patients in the HeH gro up. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 362 The stock solutions and working dilutions can be stored at 4\u00b0C (or -20\u00b0C) for short periods of time (<3 months), and for longer term storage, preferably at - 80\u00b0C. DETECTION AND SELECTION OF CLONAL IG/TCR GENE REARRANGEMENTS AT DIAGNOSIS MRD target identification can be performed using a number of techniques each based on the use of the PCR screening primers used to detect Ig and TCR gene rearrangements (primers for the detection of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements are shown in Appendix 2). This SOP does not dictate which primers should be used for screening of Ig / TCR gene rearrangements or indeed what methodology should be used for detection - NGS -based target identification, heteroduplex analysis or Genescan analysis. Rather, it is important that what ever approach is used should be subject to ongoing quality assurance testing through continuing participation in EuroMRD QC rounds. Gene Type of rearrangement 1: of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements in childhood ALL. [193-200] SEQUENCE ANALYSIS AND IDENTIFICATION OF JUNCTIONAL REGIONS The bioinformatic pipelines used for NGS -based target identification (e.g. Vidjil and ARREST) include inbuilt approaches for classification of gene rearrangements and the identification of junctional regions. These therefore avoid the requirement for sequ ence analysis and identification of junctional regions to be undertaken as a separate aspect of the methodology. However, the following information is useful to those groups who may need to employ a manual approach for either sequence analysis or the iden tification of junctional regions. As the junctional regions of rearranged Ig/TCR genes can be considered as \"DNA fingerprints\" of the leukemic cells, which are used as RQ PCR targets for sensitive ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 363 detection of MRD, it is essential to correctly assess the precise composition of the junctional region. After sequencing, the sequences of potential rearrangements should be aligned relative firstly determine the V, D and J region usage and thereafter identify the deletions and insertions that are present at each junction. In this way, patient -specific junctional regions can be identified and their potential role as MRD markers investigated. As some variations can be seen between the alignment tools from these databases, it is advisable to check the alignment and classifi cation of the junctional regions using different databases where possible and/or by manual comparison with the known sequences contained in IMGT. Hard copies of the sequences of the IG and TR repertoire can be downloaded at the following location: http://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/LocusGenes/ On occasions, the alignment tools within these databases will not provide a full analysis of the gene rearrangement. Manual analysis using hard copies of the known sequence datasets should be performed in these instances. Similarly, certain gene segments including VKint, Kde and Dd2 gene segments are not contained in some of the above databases and so cannot always be analysed automatically. Rearrange ments using these gene segments should be analysed manually using hard copies of these gene segments. The sequences of these rearrangements can be found in Appendix 4. OLIGOCLONALITY ALLTogether definition of oligoclonality: For ALLTogether, a patient is defined as being oligoclonal at a particular locus if the number of Ig/TCR clones* detected exceeds the number observed by ploidy analysis. *The number of clones for this definition is itself defined as those visible by heteroduplex analysis or those above a 5% threshold of detection for NGS analysis. One of the most significant obstacles to measuring MRD using two patient -specific markers from two different loci is the presence of oligoclonality. Childhood ALL is in general a clonal disease where the number of rearrangements per cell, at a given locus , does not exceed the number of alleles on a chromosome. Therefore, when considering IgH rearrangements, for example, a sample is assumed to be monoclonal if the number of IgH rearrangements detected by PCR is equal to or less than the IgH alleles or chro mosome 14 copy numbers. Moreover, a sample can be considered to be oligoclonal if the number of IGH rearrangements exceeds the number of IgH alleles or chromosomes 14 copies. For Pre -B ALL, the highest frequency of oligoclonality is seen at the IGH locus (45%) [201] as compared to 25% at the the IgK locus. [202] is less frequently seen in the TCR G [196] and TCR B loci.[198] In contrast to Pre -B ALL, oligoclonality in T -cell disease is relatively rare.[196] ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 364 For many years, Southern blot analysis was seen as the method of choice for the demonstration of the presence of oligoclonality. Although very informative, Southern blotting is not routinely used by MRD labs as it is not applicable for use in large -scale prospective clinical trials due to the constraints of time and the requirement for large amounts of diagnostic material. Heteroduplex analysis represents a simple, rapid and cheap alternative to S outhern blot analysis. [203] However, it should be acknowledged that the identification of two IgH rearrangements by PCR does not provide proof of a bi -allelic rearrangement but may also be due to the presence of two subclones. As outlined below (see Selection of MRD targets), it is for this reason that the optimal choice for measuring MRD is the use of two markers from two different loci (e.g. IgH and IgK). If a second target from a different locus is not available then another target from the same locus is acceptable (e.g. VH1 and VH3). Due to their relative frequency of oligoclonality in Pre -B ALL, it is important to have an analysis strategy for such patients to ensure that they too benefit from the treatment stratifications possible with ALLTogether. For patients with evidence of multiple rearrangements at a given locus, it is important to obtain confirmation from genetic analysis of the ploidy of the relevant chromosome. It is re commended that loci with evidence of oligoclonal rearrangements should be avoided for use as MRD targets wherever possible. The consequence of following just one or two targets from an oligoclonal locus is that only a proportion of the leukaemic populatio n will be monitored. Clearly at the time of diagnosis it is not possible to know which subclone may eventually cause relapse. However, due to the coincidence of oligoclonality, it is not always possible to work around the presence of an oligoclonal locus by using markers from alternative loci. Oligoclonal IgH gene rearrangements should be checked for the presence of a common DH -JH stem. A single ASO primer designed to the DH -JH stem will enable the simultaneous monitoring of multiple targets and therefore will simplify the analysis considerably. The demonstration of related species is also possible at other loci (e.g. VD2 -DD3 and VD2 -Ja29). However, it is often more difficult to find a common stem that is long enough to enable the design of a co mmon ASO primer. For patients with evidence of oligoclonality who have monoclonal rearrangements at other loci, it is permissible to study a maximum of four targets - three from the oligoclonal locus and one from another locus. For those patients with evi dence of oligoclonality and the absence of alternative targets at other loci, one of the following strategies should be used: In order to get the most complete picture of the MRD levels of at TP1 and TP2, every effort should be taken to analyse each of th e markers at an oligoclonal locus. However, it is recognised that this is not always possible. As a consequence, different strategies are described below that can employed for patients with oligoclonal disease. Different strategies are strategies are de scribed for patients where MRD analysed ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 365 Strategies that should be employed to allow stratification of therapy for patients with oligoclonal disease who have been found to have undetectable MRD are as follows: Optimal: Follow all MRD markers at the oligoclonal locus assays should a QR of Adequate: Follow all MRD markers at the oligoclonal locus. At least one marker should have a QR of 1E -04 and the remaining markers should have a QR of 5E -04. If neither of the above strategies is possible then the following should be employed: Acceptable: Follow at least two markers at the oligoclonal locus. At least one marker should have a QR of 1E -04 and the other marker should ha ve a QR of 5E -04. Other markers from the oligoclonal locus should be used if available even if the QR is not equal to 5E-04. (ii) MRD positivity Strategies that should be employed to allow stratification of therapy for patients with oligoclonal disease who h ave been found to be MRD positive are outlined below. These strategies take into account the clinical threshold of the patient being examined. For example, the clinical threshold required for a patient with the ETV6 - RUNX1 subtype is 0.1% (1E -03). The that be employed are as follows: Optimal: Follow all MRD markers at the oligoclonal locus assays should a QR of Adequate: MRD with assays where the QR of the assays is at le ast equal to the clinical threshold required for the genetic subtype of the patient under investigation. If neither of the above strategies is possible then the following should be employed: Acceptable: Follow a single MRD marker at the oligoclonal locus where the QR of the assay should at least equal the clinical threshold required for the genetic subtype of the patient under investigation. Other markers from the oligoclonal locus should be used if available even if the QR is not equal to the clinical threshold required. MRD results produced from oligoclonal markers should always be interpreted with caution particularly those results produced from a single MRD marker. When interpreting results from a single MRD marker, please note the following: Undetectable MRD Single negative results from any locus demonstrating oligoclonality are not acceptable for entry into any of the ALLTogether Risk Groups which require an undetectable MRD result. E.g. the Standard Risk Group at TP1. Positive results: By contrast, single positive and positive non -quantifiable (see section positive non -quantifiable results below) results generated from markers at an oligoclonal locus are acceptable for the MRD -based stratification for ALLTogether ALLTogether Protocol Version 366 OF MRD -PCR TARGE TS The search for MRD targets is entirely dependent upon the diversity of the IgH and TCR gene rearrangements identified upon screening. It is widely accepted that the BIOMED screening approach can be used to identify at least one clone -specific gene rearrangement in excess of 98% of patients screened. In turn, it is possible to utilize these rearrangements and produce two MRD markers able to detect disease reproducibly down to a QR of 1E -04 in > 80% of cases. Every effort should be taken to measure MRD using two targets each with a QR of 1E -04. Optimally, MRD should be measured at two different loci (e.g. IgH and IgK). If a second target from a different locus is not available then another target from the sam e locus is acceptable (e.g. VH1 and VH3). The analysis of MRD using two patient -specific MRD targets is based on the study of Steward and colleagues who showed that the high reported rates of oligoclonality and clonal evolution could be avoided by adopti ng the strategy of designing D -N-J specific ASOs and by using this approach for a minimum of two MRD markers. [204] The choice of two MRD targets helps to minimize the risk of false negative results. For patients where the diversity of rearrangements is limited and it has no t been possible to produce a second assay with a QR of 1E -04, it is acceptable to use an assay with a QR of 5E -04 and a sensitivity of 1E -04. Analysis of the outcome data for UKALL 2003 showed that 680 patients were found to be MRD negative at end of ind uction (day 29) where for the definition of an MRD negative result was defined according to the identical criteria that will be used for the classification of Undetectable MRD for ALLTogether. 482 (71%) were MRD negative using two MRD markers with a QR of 1E-04 and 198 (29%) were MRD negative using a single MRD marker with a QR of 1E -04. Bone marrow relapses were observed in 22 patients found to be MRD negative at day 29. There were nineteen relapses in patients found to be MRD negative using two MRD marke rs with a 1E -04 (relapse rate 3.9%) and three relapses in patients were found to be MRD negative using a single MRD marker with a QR of 1E -04 (relapse rate 1.5%). Based on this data, it was agreed that a negative/Undetectable MRD result obtained fr om a single MRD marker with a QR of 1E -04 would be eligible for treatment stratification on ALLTogether. It is important to note that a single negative/Undetectable MRD result generated from an MRD marker where there is evidence of oligoclonality at that locus is not acceptable for stratification of therapy of therapy for ALLTogether. Similarly, as outlined above, negative/Undetectable MRD results generated for oligoclonal patients where it has not been possible to follow one of the strategies described earlier are not eligible for stratification of therapy. In an attempt to maximize the number of patients who can be studied and on occasions where there are no MRD markers available with a QR of 1E -04, labs are encouraged to undertake the analysis of MR D using assays where the QR is < 1E -04. In this way it is possible to use less optimal assays to quantitate MRD in patients with high levels of disease. The minimum requirement of an assay for quantitation of MRD at TP1 and TP2 is that it must be at leas t equal to the clinical threshold of the genetic subtype for the patient under investigation. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 367 STABILITY There are two main causes for instability of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements during the disease course. Firstly, the Ig/TCR rearrangement may only be present in a subclone of the leukemic population, whereas it is absent in another (therapy -resistant) subclone. Studies have shown that in pre -B ALL monoclonal Ig/TCR gene rearrangements have a much higher stability (80 to 90%) than oligoclonal rearrangem ents (40 to 50%) .[205, 206] As a consequence, monoclonal rearrangements should be selected in preference. In T -ALL, oligoclonality at diagnosis is rare and the stability of T CR gene rearrangements is high; particularly TCRD gene rearrangements which are highly stable .[206] Secondly, Ig/TCR rearrangements may be prone to secondary or ongoing rearrangements. [205] In order to limit the potential for false negative results, the choice of MRD markers should focus on the following: Using monoclonal rearrangements from more than one loci Selecting Designing AOSs in the most stable part o f the junctional region for those rearrangements prone to ongoing evolution (e.g. DNJ specific ASOs). SENSITIVITY The sensitivity of ASOs designed to the junctional regions of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements is dependent on several factors, including the type of rearrangement identified and the diversity of this rearrangement relative to the normal background. If a relat ively high proportion of leukemic cells is present, the MRD level can reliably be quantified whereas in the case of very low MRD levels the assay becomes less accurate. Thus, the variation in CT values between replicates is generally less than 1.5 if the mean CT value of the replicates is below 36, with greater variation between replicates if the mean CT value of the replicates is higher. [207] Within the EuroMRD network (formerly ESG -MRD -ALL) it was decided to define the ' Quantitative range ' and the 'Sensitivity ' (see below for details). [117] The ' Quantitative range ' reflects the part of the standard curve in which the MRD levels can be quantified reproducibly and accurately, whereas the 'Sensitivity ' reflects the lowest MRD level that still can be detected, although not reproducibly and accurately. SENSITIVITY TESTING The Quantitative range (QR) and sensitivity of an ASO primer should be tested thoroughly prior to MRD quantitation us ing the logarithmic dilution series of diagnostic DNA in MNC DNA. Optimally an ASO should have a QR of 1E -04. The germline primer and probe sets shown in Appendix 2 should be used in combination with the patient -specific ASO primers. As the search for t wo MRD markers with a QR of 1E -04 for each patient is the most time consuming part of the whole method it is recommended that several primers (a minimum of 2 per rearrangement) are designed for each rearrangement. A variety of different strategies for pri mer testing are employed by the laboratories involved in the ALLTogether consortium each designed to test the likely quantitative ranges of assays. The approach followed is therefore dependent upon local preferences. One possible method for primer testin g is described below. To save time taken to test and optimise these primers a simple screening system can be used to rapidly gauge the specificity of the ASO primer. In this test the following material is amplified: ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 368 1E-02 (single well replicate) and 1E -04 (triplicate wells) dilution points from the patient -specific dilution series amplified Mononuclear cell DNA (NAC) amplified in quadruplicate Figure 1: Plate layout for ASO primer testing. Plate layout showing the amplification of the 1E -02 and 1E -04 dilution points and NACs for three ASO primers being tested (column 1 = ASO 1; column 2 = ASO 2 and column 3 = ASO 3). Up to 12 different patient -specific ASOs can be tested on a single plate. Using the a bove approach simultaneously provides the following information: The sensitivity of the assay relative to the normal background (the CT of the lowest NAC must to be at least 3 greater than the highest CT of the 1E -04 dilution points if a quantitative rang e of 1E -04 is to be achieved) The efficiency of the assay (the dCT between the 1E -02 and the mean of the 1E -04 dilutions should be between 6.2 and 7.8) The reproducibility of the assay (the dCT of the 1E should be <1.5) This simple test proc edure also avoids using large quantities of the patient -dilution for ASO optimisation. If an assay fails to meet the criteria listed above the following modification can be made to the assay conditions: Increase the annealing temperature of the assay (3oC increments are recommended) Decrease the concentration of the primers used. This should be done in an incremental manner from 1/2, 1/5 and 1/10 Increase the MgCl 2 concentration If the reproducibility of an assay is poor ( CT of the replicates > 1.5) the following steps can be taken in an attempt to improve this: Increase the final BSA concentration of the assay to 0.08% (use a 0.8% BSA solution (w/v) in place of the usual 0.4%). Increasing the amount of the primers added to the assay to twice the norma l concentration In certain cases, it may also be appropriate to decrease the annealing temperature of the assay to 58 or 59oC. It is not recommended that annealing temperatures are taken any lower than 58oC. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 369 Note: The information gained from this simple test procedure can also be used to gauge the likely performance of a patient -specific assay rather than undertaking the analysis of the complete dilution series (1E -01 to 1E -05) TARGET PRIORITY Ig and TCR gene rear rangement targets can be ordered in terms of their clonality status, stability and sensitivity according to the following target priorities: Pre-B ALL: IgK-Kde > IgH / TCR B / > TCR D > VK -JK / > TCR G T-cell ALL: Sil - Tal1 > TCR B / TCR D > TCR G The priority for Pre -B ALL targets is affected by the presence of oligoclonality at a given locus. Monoclonal rearrangements identified at other loci should be used in preference to oligoclonal rearrangements. The search for two such primers for each patient is the most time consuming part of the whole method. Therefore, it is recommended that all potential MRD targets should be optimised and decisions as to which target should be used for final RQ analysis should be made after the ASOs for each target have been tested. Targets for MRD - quantification will mainly be selected according to their sensitivity and quantitative range. RQ-PCR ANALYSIS - MEASURING MRD IN REMISSION SAMPLES The optimal strategy for the analysis of MRD for ALLTogether shou ld be based on the use of two patient -specific MRD targets. As a consequence, every effort should be made to analyse all patients enrolled on ALLTogether using two patient -specific MRD targets each able to detect MRD down to a level of 1 in 10,000 (QR = 1 E-04). For patients where the diversity of rearrangements is limited and it has not been possible to produce a second assay with a QR of 1E -04, it is acceptable to use an additional assay with a QR of 5E -04. For patients with only one Ig/TCR rearrangemen t or those where the diversity of additional rearrangements makes it impossible to produce a second MRD marker, a single MRD result at TP1 and/or TP2 is sufficient to allow allocation of therapy for ALLTogether. Note: This strategy is not permissible for those patients where a single undetectable MRD result has been produced from a locus where there is evidence of oligoclonality (number of rearrangements 3). For quantitation of MRD at TP1 and TP2, the minimum requirement of an assay is that it must be at least equal to the clinical threshold of the genetic subtype for the patient under investigation. Measurement of MRD involves: 1. Assessment of the disease level in the test sample using two patient -specific RQ assays AND 2. Assessment of the amplifiability of the test sample using the control gene RQ PCR (albumin) 1. The patient Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 370 The 3E -04 dilution should only be included in the dilution series for those patients confirmed as being HeH. Six replicates of NAC (pooled normal buffy DNA) Triplicate NTC (non template containing) controls The test sample in triplicate Each well should 600ng of DNA except the NTC wells which contain no template 2. The control RQ -PCR is used to amplify: Normal DNA dilution series in duplicate Duplicate no template controls (NTC) Duplicate test samples CONTROL GENE REAL -TIME QUANTITATIVE PCR In order to check for the quantity and quality of the DNA used for MRD analysis, RQ - PCR analysis of a control gene is required. Primer and probe sequences for the control genes in use by the ALLTogether MRD group are shown in Appendix 2. As outlined earlier, a dilution series composed of normal DNA should be prepared according to local preferences. It is essential that the dilution series has at least 3 dilution points and has a quantitative range that covers the expected concentrations of the samples being analysed. When quantifying follow -up samples, it is important that the same dilution of follow -up DNA be used for each of the quantitative MRD assays and the control gene RQ -PCRs. The criteria for an acceptable control gene RQ PCR are as follows: Slope = -3.1 to -3.9 Correlation (R2) >0.98 Minimal variation in CT between replicates of the unknown samples <0.5 The control gene value for all follow -up samples should contain a minimum 300ng and maximally 1200ng of DNA per replicate well. If the total DNA amount per well is higher than 1200ng, the follow -up sample should be diluted and re -tested since the addition of too high DNA concentrations can result in PCR inhibition. If the DNA amount added per well is <300ng, in order to prevent loss of sensit ivity, reanalysis of the sample is required following adjustment of the amount of DNA analysed. Within this acceptability range (300 - 1200ng), MRD values should be corrected for the albumin control gene value as described below (see Correction for Ampl ifiability of DNA and Expression of MRD Results). PCR 0.04% BSA should be RQ -PCR reactions to prevent inhibition. [208] ANALYSIS & INTERPRETATION OF RQ -PCR DATA Analysis and interpretation of all RQ -PCR data should be undertaken in accordance with EuroMRD guidelines. [117] This is a three stage process including: (i) Definition of the quantitative range and sensitivity of the assay ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 371 -positivity or undetectable MRD (iii) Quantitation of MRD levels in follow -up samples Once these three stages have been completed, the final MRD result should be interpreted relative to the ALLTogether stratification algorithm to allow entry in the different treatment groups. (i) Definition of Quantitative Range and Sensitivity The Quantitative Range (QR) reflects the part of the standard curve in which the MRD levels can be quantified reproducibly and accurately. The Sensitivity reflects the lowest MRD level that still can be detected, althoug h not reproducibly and accurately. In accordance with EuroMRD guidelines the quantitative range and sensitivity of the assay are defined according to the criteria outlined below. [117] The Quantitative Range is defined by the lowest dilution that meets all the following criteria: Must gi ve specific amplification, as determined by the shape of the amplification curve and (for the ABI Prism instruments) the multicomponent graph Must give reproducible amplification: CT of all replicates 1.5 Must have all CT values 3.0 lower than the lowe st CT value of the background (= amplification observed in normal MNC DNA) Must have a mean CT value within a defined range from the mean CT value of the previous dilution point 2.6 - 4.0 between 10 -fold 1E dilutions e.g. 1E -03 - 3E-04 The resulting standard curve, including the lowest dilution of the Quantitative Range and all previous dilutions: Must include at least three dilution points Must have a minimum range of two logs Must have a slope between -3.1 and -3.9 Must have a correlation coefficient 0.98 The Sensitivity is the lowest dilution that meets all the following criteria: Must give specific amplification, as determined by the sha pe of the amplification curve and (for the ABI Prism instruments) the multicomponent graph Must have at least one positive replicate; CT of the replicates is not relevant Must have the lowest CT value 1.0 lower than the lowest CT value of the background (= amplification observed in normal MNC DNA) Must have the lowest CT value < 20 cycles from the undiluted sample or, if this undiluted sample is not included in the standard curve, from the intercept of the standard curve (representing the 100 dilution) ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 372 (ii) Definition of Undetectable MRD and Positivity The ALLTogether treatment protocol includes stratification of therapy allowing for both treatment intensification and treatment reduction. For the definition of the Low Risk Group and the subsequent reduct ion of therapy, it is essential to prevent false - negative MRD results to ensure sufficiently intensive treatment for all patients. Consequently, the definition of MRD Positivity and of Undetectable MRD will be based on the EuroMRD criteria designed for cl inical protocols that aim at therapy reduction. [117] (a) Undetectable MRD Undetectable MRD results for ALLTogether will be defined as follows: No detectable amplification in the unknown samples in an assay with a quantitative range of 1E -04 (0.01%) Optimally, this should be measured with two assays with a QR of 1E -04. If a second assay with a QR is not available, it is acceptable to use an assay QR of 5E-04 providing this has a sensitivity of 1E -04. For those patients where the choice of targets is limited or where targets lack sufficient diversity a single target is acceptable providing this has a QR of 1E -04 Undetectable MRD results produced using MRD markers where the QR of at least one of the markers used is not 1E -04 are not acceptable As deta iled above, single Undetectable MRD results from any locus demonstrating oligoclonality are not acceptable for entry into any of the ALLTogether Risk Groups which require an Undetectable MRD result As defined by the EuroMRD guidelines, undetectable MRD r esults can also be defined as follows: [117] Any amplification that is within 1 CT (criteria for false negativity) of the lowest CT of the background AND Any unknown amplification that is > 4CTs from the highest CT value of the dilution representing the sensitivity of an assay (b) MRD positivity Conversely, a sample should be considered to be MRD positive if: The CT value of at least one of the three replicates is > 1.0 CT lower than the lowest CT value of the background AND The CT value of at least one of the three replicates is within 4.0 CT of the highest CT value of the dilution representing the sensiti vity of an assay (iii) Quantitation of MRD levels in follow -up samples (a) Positive and Quantifiable MRD MRD positive samples can be quantified if: The mean CT value of the replicates is than the highest CT value of the Quantitative Range AND The CT of the replicates is 1.5 ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 373 Whist every effort should be taken to analyse patients using the optimal approach to MRD analysis described above i.e. two MRD markers with a QR of 1E -04, the minimum requirement for quantitation of MRD for ALLTogether is the use of a single MRD marker where the QR of the assay used is at least equal to the clinical threshold of the respective genetic risk group for the patient being analysed. (b) Positive non -quantifiable results As outlined above, for quantitation of disease the QR of an assay must be equal to or better than the risk threshold for the respective genetic subtype for the patient under investigation. Similarly, providing the QR of the assay is able to reach the risk threshold for that genetic subtype it is also possible to use this assay to define results below this threshold as positive not quantifiable. RETESTING OF SAMPLES WITH VERY LOW MRD LEVELS In previous trials, the presence of very low MRD levels outsid e of the quantitative range of an assay has always been interpreted with caution particularly if only one well of the three replicates is positive. As such results are often not reproducible, retesting of the sample has been undertaken. For ALLTogether, it has been decided that retesting of samples with very low MRD levels should not be performed. Therefore, no assay should be repeated unless there is an obvious technical reason for doing so. A result generated from a fully acceptable assay should not b e repeated in an attempt to get an MRD negative result. CORRECTION FOR AMPLIFIABILITY OF DNA AND EXPRESSION OF MRD RESULTS MRD results should take into account any correction that may be required as a result of the control gene RQ -PCR value. Correction for albumin control gene should be undertaken for all results between the acceptable range of 300 - 1200ng according to the following calculation: (MRD value / Control Gene value (ng)) x 600ng According to EuroMRD guidelines, the MRD level should be given to one significant figure where values should rounded up or down as appropriate. [117] The final MRD result reported should be based on the highest individual MRD result produced due to the potential subclonal origin of any lower MRD value. e.g. MRD results after RQ -PCR using two patient -specific assays and an gene MRD result -03 MRD result 2 -03 Albumin control gene value = 395ng MRD results after correction for control gene value: MRD result 1 = 9.04E -03 MRD result 2 = 6.40E -03 MRD results expressed to one significant figure MRD result 1 = 9E -03 MRD 374 ALLTOGETHER TREATMENT STRATIFICATION ALLTogether aims to integrate MRD data and specific genetic abnormalities to further refine the stratification of therapy employed to accurately identify CTYA patients with the lowest and highest risk of relapse. An overview of the risk stratification for ALLTogether trial is shown in F igure 2 below. Figure 2: Overview of the risk stratification algorithm for the ALLTogether trial TP1 (day 29) All patients registered on the ALLTogether trial (both BCP and T -cell ALL) will have their MRD analysed at the end of induction (TP1). As outlined in Figure 2 above, MRD levels are used to stratify patients into the Standard Risk Group, the High Risk Grou p and the Intermediate Risk Group at TP1, where patients with Undetectable MRD are stratified into the standard risk group and those with MRD >5% are stratified into the High -risk Group. Patients with detectable MRD <5% are allocated to the Intermediate -risk group and have their MRD analysed at TP2. TP2 (Day 71) All patients in the Intermediate Risk Group at TP1 (both BCP and T -cell ALL) will have their MRD measured again at TP2. As outlined in Figure 2 above, MRD levels at TP2 are used to stratify pat ients with MRD >0.05% into the High -risk group. For the remaining patients, TP1 MRD data for the different genetic subtypes is used to stratify patients into either the Indeterminate risk -low group or the Indeterminate risk - high group. REPORTING OF RES ULTS The exact mechanism for reporting MRD results has yet to be determined.

Intrathecal medication should always be given when the first lumbar puncture (LP) is done and precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of traumatic lumbar puncture, especially for the diagnostic LP. The following are recommendations: 1. Use an atraumatic blunt (pencil type) needle in as small a size as possible. 2. The platelet count should be >50x109/L for the first LP (subsequent LPs can use a lower threshold according to local practice). 3. The diagnostic LP should be performed by an experienced practitioner. 4. For the diagnostic LP sedation /anaesthesia is recommended for children, although use of nitrous oxide either alone or in combination with other agents should be avoided due to an interaction with methotrexate [210] . 5. In case of hyperleukocy tosis, the first LP can be postponed until the WBC has fallen to <50x109/L (according to local practice). 6. After the LP head should be lowered for 30 - 60 minutes to avoid post -punctural headache, and possibly to allow the intrathecal medication to distr ibute throughout the CSF space. Sampling The following CSF samples are mandatory; CSF white cell count and red cell count Routine chemistry (Protein and glucose) according to national/local guidelines. Cytospin preparation for cell morphology CSF flow cytometry to confirm presence/absence of leukaemic blasts in patients with CNS2/3 status or traumatic lumbar puncture (recommended) The cytology samples (cell counts and cytospin) should be sent to the laboratory immediately and processed within 60 minutes (cytocentrifuge), because leukaemic blasts have low viability in CSF resulting in rapid cell lysis and, accordingly, this may contribute to false negative result. In case an immediate processing of the sample is not possible, use of preservative (e.g. al bumin) may improve the sample quality but the amount of added material needs to be taken into account in the cell chamber calculations according to local laboratory instructions. CSF Sub -studies For patients participating in the CSF -FCM study the followin g samples are also required to be taken at the Day 1, 15 and 28 LP: 3ml CSF into Transfix medium 2ml CSF for soluble biomarkers (selected centres) See sub -study appendix) for full sample processing and storage details. For other patients 2 -5ml CSF should be biobanked at day 1 (all patients) and day 15/28 (recommended). Administration of intrathecal therapy Intrathecal medication should always be given when the first lumbar puncture is done. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 394 If the patient is on anticoagulation with LMWH the preceding two doses of LMWH should be omitted prior to LP. If intraventricular administration via an Ommaya reservoir is used instead of LP, intraventricular chemotherapy should be given according to the same schedule, but at 50% of the corresponding age -based doses tha t would be given by lumbar puncture. This dose reduction reflects the significantly higher CSF concentrations of intrathecal chemotherapy that occur after direct intraventricular instillation [211] .

Dosing Patients heterozygous for TPMT and/or NUDT15 risk variants in general tolerate a dose of 6MP og 50 -60 mg/m2, and some even 75 mg/m2. Thus, preemptive dose reductions are not recommended for these patients. Patients who are homozygous for TPMT low activity alleles or homozygous for NUDT15 low activity alleles should as a starting dose receive 6 MP 5 mg/m2/day or 6TG 10 mg/m2/day. If tolerated the dose c an then carefully be increased. Dosing for variants not described above should be discussed with national coordinators. TPMT and NUDT15 genotype screening All patients should be screened for the 3 most common low activity TPMT genotypes and patients of Asian ancestry should also be screened for the 2 most common low activity NUDT15 genotypes . If no poor metabolizer genotypes are found in patients with excess ive myelotoxicity second to thiopurine therapy, more extensive analysis may be indicated. In such patients TPMT phenotyping is indicated. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 397 31.2 Clinical Guideline s for 6 -mercaptopurine/ methotrexate maintenance therapy CLINICAL STUDY: ALLTogether EUDRACT -001795 -38 DEVELOPMENT PHASE III DOCUMENT TYPE: Clinical Study Protocol Guidelines NAME OF GUIDELINE: Guidelines for 6 -mercaptopurine/methotrexate maintenance therapy AUTHOR/S: Kjeld Schmiegelow SPONSOR: Karolinska University Hospital CHIEF INVESTIGATOR MD PhD Mats Heyman VERSION number: FINAL Version 1.0 RELEASE DATE: 5 August 2019 NO. OF PAGES: 4 ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 398 Patients should have an ANC >0.75x109/L (and not falling) and platelets >75x109/L (and not falling) when initiating maintenance therapy [216] . 1. Duration: Maintenance therapy is initiated week 25 (VLR), 32 (IR -low), 37 (IR - high), and 30 (HR) and discontinued 2.0 years after achieved complete remission. This duration is independent of the total cumulative administered number of days and doses of 6MP and MTX. 2. 6MP/MTX: The maintenance therapy backbone employs daily oral 6MP and weekly oral MTX. a. 6MP: The starting dose is 75 mg/m2 orally once per day. The starting dose is reduced to 10 mg/m2/day for TPMT and/or NUDT15 homozygous low activity patients [215, . b. MTX: The starting dose is 20 mg/m2 orally once per week. For patients receiving intrathecal methotrexate: During the weeks when intrathecal MTX is given, the oral dose is omitted or adjusted to an appropriate total dose, depending on the size of the patient. c. Circadian schedule and co -administration of food (including milk products): 6MP and MTX should be given at a regular schedule, but there are no restrictions regarding the circa dian schedule or dosing in relation to intake of food (including milk products) [218, 219] . 3. Dexamethasone/vincristine and vincristine (VCR), these Dexa/VCR pulses should be given regardless of blood counts. One pulse consists of a. Dexa: 6.0 mg/m2/day orally for five days, divided into three daily doses (2.0 mg/m2/dose). No tapering. Dexa may influence neutrophil counts, which should not lead to maintenance therapy dose adjustments. b. VCR: 1.5 mg/m2 (maximum single dose 2.0 mg) intravenously on day 1. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 4. Intrathecal therapy: For patients receiving intrathecal therapy during maintenance: During the weeks when intrathecal MTX is given, the oral dose is omitted or adjusted to an appropriate total dose. It is allowed to move the VCR -dose one day forward to avoid giving it the same day as the intrathecal therapy. 6MP/MTX dose adjustments: 5. Treatment interruptions and treatment duration: Once maintenance therapy is initiated, the clock does not stop regardless of whether treatment is given or not. Thus, if oral 6MP and/or oral MTX are intermittently interrupted due to myelosuppression, infections or other toxicities, these days are still c ounted as days of maintenance therapy, which is discontinued 2.0 years from the end of achieved induction therapy. Thus, the duration of therapy is independent of the total cumulative number of days and administered doses of 6MP and MTX. 6. 6MP/MTX dose esca lation: a. Target of myelosuppression: The aim is to adjust 6MP and MTX doses to maintain an ANC level of 0.75 -1.5x109/L, and the platelet count >75x109/L[216] . b. High ANC: If ANC >1.5x109/L and platelets >100x109/L for two weeks or more, the dose of 6MP should be escalated in steps of 25% up to 150 mg/m2. If the ANC is still 1.5x109/L at a 6MP dose of 150 mg/m2, increase oral MTX by 25% (from 20 mg/m2) up to a dose of 40 mg/m2. NB Consider non -adherence in case of tolerated 6MP >125 mg/m2 and of MTX >30 mg/m2, not least in case of ANC 1.5x109/L and normal AT levels. In principle, there are no maximum doses for 6MP and MTX, but persistent and tolerated doses of 6MP ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 399 >150 mg/m2 or MTX >40 mg/m2 is extremely rare and should be discussed with the national principal investigators of ALLToget her. c. High ANC in spite of dose increments: In a small subset of patients it may be impossible to obtain a stable ANC within the target range (0.75 -1.5x109/L) with 6MP and MTX dose increments without inducing i) severe hepatotoxicity (rise in AT and affecte d liver function tests, often due to high levels of methylated 6MP metabolites [212] ) or ii) intermittent sudden bone -marrow aplasia at very moderate dose increments. Discuss such patients with the national principal investigators of the ALLTogether. 7. Dose reduction: a. Neutro -/thrombocytopenia, moderate: If the ANC falls to 0.5 -0.75 x109/L and/or the platelet counts falls to 50 -75x109/L: Halve the dose of 6MP and oral MTX. NB In some patients ANC stabilizes between 0.5 -0.75 x 109/L without infections. b. Neutro -/thrombocytopenia, severe: If the ANC is < 0.5x109/L and/or the platelet count is <50x109/L: STOP 6MP and oral MTX. RESTART when ANC is rising and >0.50x109/L and platelet count is rising and >50x109/L. Restart at the tolerated dose (=before treatment interruption), when ANC >0.75x109/L and platelet count >75x109/L. NB: If counts fluctu ate wildly after 6MP and MTX are reintroduced and cross the limits for treatment interruption, then start at 50% of the previously tolerated doses and titrate upwards (first 6MP, then MTX) to avoid such frequent interruptions to 6MP and MTX. c. Discordant th rombocytopenia: If patients develop thrombocytopenia <75 x109/L not associated should be considered. 8. Aminotransferases (AT): A rise in AT levels, even at 20 -40x UNL, does not in itself warrant dose adjustment, and routine measurements of AT are not mandatory. Low AT is seen in 5 -10% of patients, who have low TPMT activity [212] . These patients generally respond to 6MP dose increments with neutropenia. Due to a significant association between methylated 6MP metabolites (Ery -MeMP) and a rise in AT [212] , measurements of AT can be relevant for patients suspected of poor treatment adherence, since normal AT in TPMT wild type patients indicate non-adherence, not least in case of normal neutrophil counts. 9. Coagulation factors: Measurements are not mandatory. If measured and coagulation factors II -VII-X fall <0.5, oral 6 -MP/MTX should be reduced or withheld. Consider other causes than MTX/6MP therapy (e.g. viral hepatitis, K - vitamin deficiency). If coagulation factors are the only sign of hepatotoxicity, consider K -vitamin supplementation. 10. Bilirub in: Measurements are not mandatory. However, if measured and > 50 mol/L (3x upper normal limit, UNL), oral 6 -MP and MTX should be reduced or withheld. Other causes of hyperbilirubinemia should be considered, e.g. viral hepatitis, SOS, or Gilbert syndrome. 11. Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia (not least in after fasting, incl. in the morning) is frequently seen during maintenance therapy due to impaired glycogenolysis and/or gluconeogenesis [221] . Some patients complain of fatigue, nausea, or gastrointestinal symptoms. They generally have elevated AT le vels, but otherwise normal liver function tests. Neither these symptoms nor hypoglycemia itself indicate 6MP or MTX dose adjustments. Some patients ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 400 respond well to diabetic food (slowly absorbed carbohydrates) and/or rapidly absorbed carbohydrates (e.g. ap ple juice), when having symptoms. Severe, refractory cases should be discussed with the national principal investigators of the ALLTogether. 12. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome: If case of persistent discordant thrombocytopenia <75x109/L (i.e. not accompanied by neutropenia <0.75x109/L) or any of the other clinical indications of SOS, the patient should be evaluated for SOS, incl. abdominal ultrasound, to determine presence of ascites, reduced liver vessel flow, hepatic steatosis or fibrosis. SOS is uncommon during 6MP/MTX maintenance therapy. SOS is defined according to the international definition, fulfilling at least 3 of 5 criteria: (1) Hyperbilirubinemia, (2) unexplained thrombocytopenia (i.e. without concurrent neutropenia), (3) weight ga in > 5.0%, (4) liver pain, and (5) ascites [37]. Sonographic demonstration of compr omised hepatic blood flow can support the diagnosis, but the blood flow on ultrasound is frequently normal, at least in the early phases. Any case of SOS should within 48 hours be registered in the ALLTogether online database. 13. Nodular regenerative hepatoto xicity (NRH): This is a non -cirrhotic hypertension can be induced by thiopurine therapy [220] . There are typically symptoms of portal hypertension (weakness, ascites, splenomegaly, esophageal varices) in a patient wi th little evidence of chronic liver disease. The diagnosis is confirmed by liver biopsy, showing absence of significant fibrosis and presence of nodularity usually best defined by reticulin staining. On superficial review, the liver biopsy may appear norma l. NRH is usually accompanied by unexplained thrombocytopenia. Serum enzymes are generally normal or minimally elevated, although acute elevations in serum enzymes accompanied by what appears to be sinusoidal obstructive syndrome may precede the developmen t of NRH. Jaundice is rare. Ultimately, NHR may lead to liver failure and need for liver transplantation. Among ALL patients, NRH has mostly been described with 6TG therapy, but it is very rare with 6 -mercaptopurine therapy or low dose 6TG therapy (<12.5 m g/m2) 14. Skin rashes : Skin rashes as an adverse drug reaction can be seen during maintenance therapy, but is far more common 2 -6 weeks after cessation of maintenance therapy. It usually disappears without any intervention.

SPONSOR: Karolinska University Hospital CHIEF INVESTIGATOR MD PhD Mats Heyman VERSION number: FINAL Version 1.0 RELEASE DATE: 5 August 2019 NO. OF PAGES: 2 ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 402 Hematologic: A. During Chemotherapy (all patients prior to HSCT): Do not hold or reduce dose for low blood counts, unless prolonged (resulting in a >14 day delay in next bl ock of chemotherapy). Prior to Maintenance : If neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia results in delay of next block of chemotherapy by > 14 days: Hold Imatinib and resume at the same dose once ANC/platelet counts recover sufficiently to begin the next block of treatment. If subsequent blocks of treatment are delayed for >14 days due to neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, Imatinib should be held, and dose may be reduced when restarted after ANC/platelet count recovery (e.g., 20% dose reduction of Imatinib). During Maintenance: If ANC falls below 0.5 x109/L or if platelet count falls below 50 x109/L: continue imatinib but hold 6MP and methotrexate, as indicated below. If after 2 weeks of holding methotrexate/6MP, ANC remains below 0.5 x109/L or platelet count below 50 x109/L, Imatinib should be held. Imatinib should be restarted without dose reduction once counts recover (ANC >0.5 x109/L, platelets > 50 x109/L. For recurrent neutropenia/thrombocytopenia: First reduce doses of 6MP/methotrexate, as indicated bel ow. Imatinib dose may be reduced by 20% if low blood counts recur in patients already receiving dose -reduced 6MP/methotrexate. Hepatic: A. >2.0 mg/dL . Restart when direct bilirubin is Grade 1 or lower (< 1.5 x ULN). Resume at full dose. Reduce dose by 20% if elevation of direct bilirubin recurs. B. Elevated AST/ALT: if transaminases > ULN Imatinib if transamin ases >10x ULN. Restart at full dose when < 5 x ULN (Grade 2 or less). If liver dysfunction recurs, reduce dose of Imatinib by 20% only after dose reducing other chemotherapy (eg, MTX/6MP during maintenance) and withholding other potentially causative agent s. Infection: Hold Imatinib if Grade 4 infection until clinically improved (Grade 3 or lower), and then restart without dose reduction. Do not hold for uncomplicated less severe infections (Grade 3 or lower). Infection: Hold imatinib for Grade 4 infection until clinically improved (Grade 3 or lower), and then restart without dose reduction. Do not hold for uncomplicated less severe infections (Grade 3 or lower). Cardiac Toxicity: If Grade 1 QTc elevation: hold other agents associated with prolonged QTc. If no improvement, then Imatinib should be held until resolution, and then restarted. For Grade 2 or higher QTc interval, hold Imatinib. Imatinib may be resumed once QTc prolongation resolves (< Grade 1). Imatinib dose may by 20% if QTc prolonga tion recurs. Edema/Effusions: If higher pericardial, pleural effusions, or when edema/effusion resolves if thought to be unrelated or unlikely to be related to Imatinib. If the effusion is felt to be caused by Imatinib, then consider restarting IImatinib at 80% dose when resolved. Close follow - up is warranted after restarting Imatinib in the latter situation. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 403 Other Grade 3 or higher Non -Hematologic Toxicity: Holding Ima tinib or reducing dose is discouraged. However, if patient experiences Grade 3 or higher non -hematologic toxicity that is thought to be likely or definitely related to Imatinib that does not resolve despite symptomatic treatment, Imatinib may be held after discussion with national coordinator or international chair. In such instances, Imatinib should be restarted once toxicity has resolved to Grade 2 or lower. If the patient does not tolerate Imatinib switch to Dasatinib (dose 60 mg/m2). Such cases should be discussed with the national coordinator or the international study chair. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 404 31.4 Clinical Guideline s for Real -time therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of -38 DEVELOPMENT PHASE III DOCUMENT TYPE: Clinical Study Protocol Guidelines NAME OF GUIDELINE: Real-time therapeutic drug monitoring der Sluis SPONSOR: Karolinska University Hospital CHIEF INVESTIGATOR MD PhD Mats Heyman VERSION number: FINAL Version 1.0 RELEASE DATE: 5 August 2019 NO. OF PAGES: 6 ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 405 Real -time therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of asparaginase Aim Detection of silent inactivation (SI) and allergic like -reactions to improve asparaginase therapy Background Drug monitoring is the only method to detect silent inactivation of PEG - asparaginase. Furthermore, by monitoring asparaginase levels we may prevent severe allergic reactions e.g. anaphylactic shock because the next dose will not be administered when silent inactivation is found. Patients with silent inactivation will switch to Erwinia asparaginase. An allergic -like reaction is an intolerance or infusion reaction with e.g. vomiting, stomach ache, rash etc. These patients have normal activity levels if the in fusion is continued. Real allergies often occur at the first drops, while allergic -like reactions occur later during infusion. Distinction between hypersensitivity and allergic -like reactions is critical but may be difficult. Patients with an 'allergic -like reaction', mimicking a clinical allergy but without neutralization of asparaginase activity, might continue with the same preparation since they maintain adequate asparaginase activity levels when subsequent administr ations are clinically possible. Hypersensitivity definitions PdL toxicity project definitions of hypersensitivity reaction will be used. (Reference: Schmiegelow et al. Consensus definitions of 14 severe acute toxic effects for childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment: a Delphi consens us. Lancet Oncol 2016.) 1. Allergy 2. Silent inactivation 3. Allergic -like reactions Ad 1. allergy: An adverse local or general response from exposure to Asp characterised by flushing, rash, urticaria, drug fever, dyspnoea, sympto matic bronchospasm, edema/angioedema, hypotension and/or anaphylaxis (accompanied by inactivation of Asp activity*). * Trough level < Lower Limit of Quantification (LLQ) before the 'allergic' dose. A post-infusion Asp activity level cannot be measured accurately, when an infusion is stopped after a few millilitres. Ad 2. silent inactivation: Patients without clini cal allergy but with Asp activity levels, preferably measured in 2 independent samples, of: PEG -asp (biweekly schedule): Day 7 < 100 and/or day 14 < LLQ Erwinase(every other day schedule: Day 2 < LLQ (rec) -coli asparaginase day 3 < LLQ General def inition: (trough) Asp activity level < LLQ Ad 3. allergic -like reaction: An intolerance with e.g. vomiting, stomach ache, rash etc. These patients have normal activity levels if the infusion is continued. Real allergies often occur at the first drops, while allergic -like reactions occur later during infusion. Distinction between hypersensitivity and allergic -like reactions is critical but may be difficult. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 406 Severity mild: transient flushing or rash or drug fever < 38o C; or severe: drug fever without urticaria, and/or hypotension and anaphylaxis) with indication for Asp infusion interruption and parenteral medication (e.g. antihistamines, glucocorticost eroids). PEG -asparaginase therapy and monitoring schedule Asparaginase is administered in a continuous dosing schedule in order to reduce the number of hypersensitivity reactions. Asparaginase activity levels will be measured in real-time in all patients to detect silent inactivation and distinguish allergic -like reactions from real allergic reactions. Patients will switch preparation in case of inactivation. Inactivation (allergy and silent inactivation) can occur following any dose in the continuous dosi ng schedule and will occur more frequent in induction or after a dose interruption. PEG -asparaginase administrations and monitoring are summarized in table 1 and 2. PEG -asparaginase is administered IV or IM in a fixed dose of 1500 IU/m2 in patients < 16 years of age and 1000 IU/m2 in patients > 16 years of age . All patients receive 2 doses in induction (day 4, 18) and 2 doses in consolidation on day 32 and 46. The number of total doses depends on the risk group stratification. Patients in the standard ris k group receive a total of 4 doses, in the intermediate risk (IR)-low 5 doses, and the IR -high 8 doses. High Risk group patients receive 5 -13 doses, with 5 continuous doses till start of HR blocks. HR blocks contain 1 PEG - asparaginase dose per block and 2 doses in delayed intensification. Because of the discontinuous dosing schedule in the HR blocks week levels will be measured to detect silent inactivation. Table 1.

Take the second sample as soon as possible after obtaining knowledge of suspected SI - If extra samples are taken it is advised to ta ke day 7 and/or day 14 levels NOTE 2: Consider storage of a pre -treatment serum sample for the assessment of anti-drug-antibodies and storage of every serum sample measured. NOTE 3: Peak levels (within 1 hour after infusion) are also measured, after wr itten informed consent, in patients participating in the asparaginase -outcome study (see for detailed sampling schedule add -on study protocol \"Association between asparaginase activity levels and outcome\"). ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 408 Switching guidelines PEG - and Erwinia asparaginase 1. Allergy all grades and inactivation a. Switch PEG -asp to Erwinia asp (20.000 U/m2 IV or IM, every other day). If the patient also develops an allergy with inactivation to Erwinia asp, no alternative asparaginase preparation is available and asp treatment needs to be truncated. Consider switch to native E-coli asparaginase (e.g. Spectrila 5.000 IU/m2, IV or IM every 3 days) with an allergy to the first PEG -asparaginase dose, because this often is a PEG allergy and not an E-coli asparagin ase allergy. Also consider an allergic -like reaction. b. Do not use steroids or antihistamines to administer next doses, because it will not reverse the inactivation. c. When no trough asparaginase activity level is available see 3b . If clinically imposs ible to re -expose the preparation should be switched or stopped. 2. Silent inactivation a. Switch PEG -asp to Erwinia asp (20.000 U/m2 IV or IM every other day) Consider switch to native E-coli asparaginase ( e.g. Spectrila 5000 IU/m2 IV or IM every 3 days) with SI of the first dose, because this often caused by anti-PEG antibodies and not by anti - E-coli asparaginase antibodies. b. If the patient also develops an allergy to or SI of Erwinia asp, no alternative asparagina se preparation is available and asparaginase treatment needs to be truncated. 3. Allergic -like reaction a. When the trough asp activity level taken before this dose is adequate you can re -expose carefully to the same preparation (if clinically possible). In these cases premedication with hydrocortisone and antihistamines is allowed as well as decreasing the infusion rate. Re -exposure should only be performed in the context of strict monitoring of activity levels (see b.) b. When no trough level is availab le, check the asparaginase activity level after the truncated dose taking into account how much of the dose is administered, in case of detectable asparaginase activity you can re -expose carefully to the same preparation (if clinically possible). (guidel ines for asparaginase activity level measurement : after PEG -asp immediately (within one hour = peak level) after the truncated dose, within a few days or 1 week. Timing of asp activity level also depend on how much of the dose is given! In case of Erwinia asp take a peak level and a level after 24-48hrs. If only a few milliliters are infused a post -dose activity level might not be informative and asparaginase preparation should be switched or stopped.) Erwinia asparaginase therapy and monitoring schedule Patients with a clinical allergy (with inactivation) or silent inactivation of PEG - asparaginase will switch to Erwinia asparaginase. Type of allergy and grading according to PdL definitions and interventions (medication, i.v. saline etc.) is documented. Thi s documentation is also needed in case of an allergy to Erwinia asparaginase. Dose and timing The dose of Erwinia asparaginase is 20.000 IU/m2 IV or IM every other day Start Erwinia asparaginase ASAP(within a few days) after the occurrence of the allergic reaction or SI, do not wait for 2 weeks (because activity levels will be <LLQ) , and replace the last PEG -asparaginase dose. Substitution of 1 dose PEG -asparaginase by 7 doses Erwinia asparaginase. ALLTogether Protocol Version 1.4_09 Sep 2020 409 Aims TDM of Erwinia asparaginase: To detect SI To distinguish allergic -like reactions from real allergic reactions TDM time points/frequency of monitoring Sampling should be started immediately, before the first Erwinia asparaginase infusion (to check PEG -asparaginase activity/necessity to switch) Prior to the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th Erwinia asparaginase infusion : asparaginase activity level Send the first 4 asparaginase levels (batch wise) to the laboratory Repeat asparaginase level every 2 weeks (1x T48 level) In case of a suspected allergic -like reaction take a peak level (within one hour) and a 24 -48 hour asp activity level as described above (section 'Switching guidelines PEG - and Erwinia asparaginase') . Continue erwinia asp when clinically possible. Stopping guidelines: Silent inactiv ation (real) allergies with inactivation NOTE 1: Erwinia asparaginase clearance decreases in the first weeks of treatment NOTE 2: 1 vial of Erwinia asparaginase contains 10.000 U. Adapting a dose can only be based on asparaginase activity levels, in that case dose can be rounded to the nearest whole vial strength. (Recombinant) native E -coli asparaginase Very few patients will receive native E -coli asparaginase. Also, commercially available as recombinant E -coli asparaginase (Spectrila ). Native E -coli asparaginase can be considered after an allergy to or silent inactivation of the first PEG -asparaginase dose, because this often is a PEG allergy and not an E -coli asparaginase allergy. Dose: Native E -coli asparaginase or Spectrila 5000 IU/m2 IV or IM, every 3 days Asp activity monitoring: prior to the first, 2nd and 3rd dose Adequate asparaginase level ( > 100 U/mL)? - yes, take a trough level every other dose - no, switch to Erwinia asparaginase Allergy (with inactivation) s witch to Erwinia asparaginase Method of asparaginase activity level measurement Asparaginase activity levels will be assessed in centralized laboratories in the various countries using the L -aspartic -hydroxamate (AHA) test. [222] AHA is hydrolyzed by asparaginase to L -aspartic acid and hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine will be diluted with 8 -hydroxiquinoline for condensation and oxidation and quantified by photometric detection. Quality control of the asparaginase activity measurement s is assured by a cross validation process (distributing samples, receiving results, setting up statistics, response to the labs) performed by an independent institute Referenzinstitut f\u00fcr Bioanalytik ( https://www.rf b.bio/ ). This institute is certified by the German Medical Association. Asparaginase activity levels will be measured in all patients as standard of care and will be captured in the ALL together database.
