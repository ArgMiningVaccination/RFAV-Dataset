The Zika virus, or ZIKV, spreads through mosquito bites and sexual intercourse. Currently, no approved vaccine or antivirals against ZIKV exist. \"Suppressing host immunity is a common strategy employed by viruses to achieve successful infection,\" said Jikui Song, a professor of biochemistry at UCR, who co-led the study. \"Our work provides valuable structural and functional information on the interaction between ZIKV and its host and offers a framework for the development of vaccines and antivirals.\" The [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0472-y) [ appears in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0472-y) Song explained the steps involved in suppressing the host immune response. ZIKV encounters the first line of defense by way of a type I interferon, or IFN, response in the host. Secreted by infected cells, IFNs are natural substances that help the host's immune system fight infection. Once ZIKV infects the cell, it presents a nonstructural protein, NS5, which interacts with a key player in the type I IFN pathway: the STAT2 protein. The interaction between ZIKV NS5 STAT2 degrades STAT2, which inhibits the type I IFN response. The research involved first solving the crystal structure of a complex between a large fragment of ZIKV NS5 and STAT2. This crystal structure guided the researchers in solving the cryo-EM structure of ZIKV NS5 and STAT2, which then led them to come up with a model for how ZIKV NS5 suppresses human STAT2. \"Understanding the interaction, at the molecular level, between ZIKV NS5 and the host immune factor STAT2, opens up a new window for the rational design of live attenuated vaccines and antivirals\" said study co-leader Rong Hai, an assistant professor of virology at UCR. \"Targeting the virus-host interaction may also provide an important approach for drug development against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\" The researchers also generated a panel of mutant ZIKV viruses. \"To our knowledge, these are the first NS5-based ZIKV mutants, which have the potential to be used as live attenuated ZIKV vaccines,\" Hai said. Next, the researchers will work on the structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to identify new targets against COVID-19. Song and Hai were joined in the study by [Z.
