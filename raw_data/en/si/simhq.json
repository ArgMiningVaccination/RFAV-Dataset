Additionally, the number of people who have been injured or disabled by COVID jabs is skyrocketing and medical authorities have not been able to manage these issues in an adequate transparent manner or provide professional treatment guidelines to doctors or the public on how to help them. The core problem is that the jabs have caused [injuries](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.658428/full) to our [immune system functioning](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.03.21256520v1), [damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7246018/?report=reader) to our [mitochondria](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/epub/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318902) (the cellular engines), both of which disable our normal physiologic functions. The main objective of treatment is to help our body enhance the two basic elements of human health: our self-healing mechanisms and vibrant natural immunity. There are just a handful of currently published articles or reports that acknowledge the depth of impact of side effects of COVID jabs, post-marketing, in the real world more than one year after the global vaccination program. The treatment strategies being recommended currently are based on doctors' pathological and clinical observations as well as scattered experiences from patients themselves. Just how complex is our self healing mechanism? How many layers does our immune system have? Could one method or one drug possibly be the solution for it all? Most of us have received allopathic medical training in medical universities, and we have our clinical experiences to judge effectiveness of healing methods. All of us have realized that we have to be open-minded and continue seeking effective ways to heal until we achieve satisfactory recovery. We will provide what we have studied, researched, and observed in a responsible manner based on our over 30 years of medical and scientific research background. We have discussed various healing strategies including using [natural compounds to stop the binding of spike protein](https://www.theepochtimes.com/spike-protein-detox-6-main-medicines-and-natural-compounds_4480559.html) with cellular receptors, neutralizing the intracellular toxicities spike protein, [enhancing the self-repairing mechanisms like autophagy](https://www.theepochtimes.com/vaers-autophagy_4497753.html), and energy healing. Here, we would like to share a novel effective method that we have researched in recent years that may help people who are seeking solutions and want to heal themselves. Unexpected Recovery From Jab Induced Severe Brain Disease Recently, one of my friends shared her father's experience of an unexpected recovery from a critical condition that was caused by a COVID injection. He is a man in his 70s living in a southern city in China. In June 2021 he received the first dose of a COVID vaccine developed by Beijing Institute of Biological Products, a whole SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide developed by SinoPharm. In December 2021, he received the second jab and had no obvious adverse reaction. In January 2022, a third shot was given to him. Ten days after the third jab, he felt coldness and weakness all over his body, gradually became unable to walk, and soon progressed to being unable to speak. He went to several major hospitals and underwent MRI examinations of the brain and was diagnosed with [brainstem encephalitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4939433/), which is an uncommon condition characterized by autoimmune-induced demyelination syndrome in the brainstem and nervous system. His symptoms did not improve after receiving infusion therapies in a few hospitals for his symptoms. One month after the third injection, his daughter couldn't hear what he was saying when she phoned him due to his speaking problems. The hospital issued a critical illness notice and told him that there was no more treatment for him. He accepted his daughter's suggestion of doing a surprisingly simple, easy, and cost-free method. She asked him to speak nine Chinese characters, also called the nine true words, with a calm and concentrated mind and to repeat it whenever he could. The next day, his mind was clearer and his symptoms had significantly improved. Even the attending doctor was surprised and asked how he was able to recover so well without any effective drug treatment. He is still, to this day, in a stable recovery process. What a surprise! He healed himself by simply speaking a few specific words. Miraculous Recovery From COVID-19 by Repeating the Same Words My friend's father's story simply reminded me of another case from 2020. I not only interviewed the woman myself but I also wrote a [medical case report](https://f1000research.com/articles/10-166/v1) and published it in an online medical journal in March 2021. A 73-year-old Jewish American woman who had past cardiovascular diseases and cancer history, suffered from loss of taste, had a low-grade fever, and body pains. After taking acetaminophen, the patient initially felt better, but then began to experience worsening symptoms of fatigue, body aches, and difficulty breathing. At her worst, she was afraid she might die. That's when a friend reached out and suggested that she recite the same nine Chinese words. She recited the words many times a day, whenever she felt difficulty breathing. \"I started saying the mantra slowly because I wasn't sure if I was pronouncing the words correctly since my prayers in Hebrew must be exact,\" she said. She recited these words many times a day, whenever she had difficulties breathing, roughly every hour during the day. Each recitation lasted about 5-10 repetitions. In the beginning she was saying the mantra very frequently. She quickly realized that oxygen was getting into her lungs when she was saying the mantra and it was clearing congestion that had solidified in her chest. Upon realizing that the mantra was clearing her chest, she started repeating the mantra more often to quicken her recovery. After three days of reciting the mantra in this manner, the patient was able to breathe normally. After reciting the words, she found that her symptoms began to recede. \"My lungs [have] opened. I can inhale longer and deeper.\" Within nine days, she was back to normal and breathing normally without fatigue or weakness. \"I think the mantra chanting triggers a healing process that enhances the intake of oxygen and air into my chest,\" she added. \"I want to say that [chanting] the mantra cured more than one ailment of mine. I had several different types of illnesses, but all symptoms are gone.\" She reported that her earlier heart disease and other medical conditions disappeared. Previously her heartbeat was 44 to 46 beats per minute. After sincerely reciting the nine words, her heart rate has been 50 to 54 beats per minute since May 20, 2020. \"This mantra is good for people with breathing problems, with vascular problems,\" she said. \"I dare say that it is good for everybody, not just coronavirus patients,\" she added. According to a large case series analysis in China, 14 percent of COVID-19 patients had severe symptoms (with dyspnea, respiratory frequency 30 breaths/min, etc.) and 5 percent were critical (with respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure). The mortality rate was 2.3 percent in all cases and 49.0 percent in critical cases. For older people, [it was 8 percent for those aged >70 years and 14.8 percent for those aged 80 years](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.2648). Case fatality was elevated among those with pre-existing comorbid conditions; it was 10.5 percent for cardiovascular disease, 7.3 percent for diabetes, 6.3 percent for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0 percent for hypertension, and 5.6 percent for cancer. [Another retrospective study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/7228874) including the first 200 COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center in New York also found increasing age was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. A noteworthy observation is that the patient in the current report was in her 70s, with a history of coronary artery disease and cancer; she would have had a very low chance of spontaneous recovery if she had not recited the mantra. The only factor to help alleviate her symptoms and recover from breathing difficulties was chanting the nine words. She said, \"repeating the mantras has changed my energy level.\" She also shared her experience in an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmIjfLn8xTU) with The Epoch Times. More Cases: Recovering From COVID-19 Symptoms After Reciting the Same Words There are several other case studies of other besides the American woman in New York who recovered from COVID-19 symptoms by reciting the nine Chinese words. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, I have been exploring methods and searching for cases of people who cured themselves from COVID-19. I found a few interesting case series and adopted a retrospective and observational approach to summarize what I have found. There were 36 eligible cases from six ethnic groups and six countries, with 17 percent (n= 6) of the patients being older people over 70. Eight percent (n=3) of the reported cases were medical professionals. Patients reported respiratory symptoms, fever, coughing, dyspnea or breathing difficulties, and/or neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptoms range from mild, moderate to severe. The vast majority 91% of patients had moderate or severe symptoms. Of these 36 cases, over 47 percent (n=17) received hospital treatment or medication. But the treatments were either ineffective or initially effective and followed by a rapid relapse or worsening of symptoms. After reciting the nine Chinese characters, all of them experienced symptom improvement, while 72 percent (n=26) recovered fully. The median time for improvement was one day, and three days for recovery. A multiple causality analysis indicated that clinical improvement comes from reciting the nine words. Surprisingly, data showed three critically ill patients either improved significantly or recovered completely after reciting these words. Though each of the patients recited the nine words, the frequency varied with some repeating them daily and others repeating them many times a day. Here are a few examples of noteworthy cases: 1) Case 6 was an 80-year-old Chinese male from Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. After six days of treatment in a hospital, he showed no improvement. In early February, he was admitted to the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Due to his critically ill condition, the 80-year-old man had little desire to live and thus was unwilling to cooperate with his physicians. His relatives then advised him to recite these nine words. Being old and critically ill, he could only remember the first five words. As he sincerely and silently recited the Chinese words every day, his symptoms disappeared and his mental state improved. On the seventh day, his doctor tested him and found the SARS-CoV-2 test was negative. On the eighth day, he fully recovered and was discharged from the hospital. 2) Case 26 was a 78-year-old Vietnamese female from Paris, France. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 at the end of March 2020. She had high persistent fever for over a week and was admitted to the hospital emergency room in a semi-unconscious state. Her niece called and asked her to recite the nine characters. She did. By the next morning, her symptoms of infection disappeared. She fully recovered and was discharged soon. 3) Case 36 was a Chinese male student studying at Harvard University in the United States. In early April 2020, a Chinese postgraduate student at Harvard University was hospitalized with COVID-19. The student was in a semi-comatose state in the ICU and diagnosed with 60 percent lung necrosis. There was basically no hope for him to survive. Somehow, his classmate asked him to recite these words. He took her advice, recited them, and recovered from the coronavirus the lung damage it had caused. 4) Case 35 was a 64-year-old female from Denmark. On February 18, 2020, she traveled to Spain. Two days later, she started coughing. She returned to Denmark on February 26 and developed a fever on February 28 or 29. By March 5, she had the COVID-19 symptoms of \"loss of taste and breathing difficulty.\" On March 13, her condition worsened. Her chest X-ray showed symptoms of pneumonia and bronchitis. The doctor treated her with penicillin but her condition continued to deteriorate. By March 23, she had difficulty breathing. The following day, the doctor asked her to inhale oxygen, but without any effect. Then on March 26, her brother called and advised her to recite the nine words. After two days of reciting, her coughing stopped. At the time of the report date, she could talk easily and ride a bicycle on the street. 5) Case 32 was a 58-year-old Turkish female in Brix, France. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in late March 2020. For 11 days, she could not eat anything and felt constant bone pain. She reported that she felt like snakes and other animals were biting her under her skin and bones or eating her. That feeling was \"terrible\" and so dreadful that she wanted to die. She even contemplated suicide. Then in April, her nephew in the Netherlands contacted her and advised her to recite the nine word mantra. As soon as she started reciting, she reported feeling surprisingly happy. Her condition improved quickly. \"Every time I recite it, I feel like I'm resurrected from death,\" she said. \"It happens again and again. How did I make it? This is a miracle!\" she uttered. On April 20, 2020, when her nephew called her again, she reported feeling \"lively, healthy, and thinking clearly.\" 6) Case 28 was a 79-year-old Vietnamese male living in Paris, France. He was hospitalized for throat cancer in April 2020. While he was in hospital, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and was in a critical state. His friend advised him to recite the mantra. In the morning after he sincerely started reciting, he felt much better. Two days later his COVID-19 symptoms disappeared and the hospital discharged him. 7) Case 27 was an adult Vietnamese male living in Paris, France. One night in April 2020, he felt very weak and called a medical emergency number. The paramedic team came to give him antipyretic medicine and left. But his fever did not improve. He called his landlady, who went to see him and found the heating in the bedroom was on to the maximum. The bedroom was hot like a sauna. He was wearing a woolen hat, curled and bundled up like a plush teddy bear under a quilt. But he still felt cold and was shivering under the quilt. His landlady wrote these nine words on a piece of paper and asked him to keep reciting the words. He did this throughout the night. The next day, he felt much better. As he had coughed up some blood, he went to a hospital for a checkup. Based on the test results, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and was hospitalized. In the hospital, he continued to recite them. By the 3rd day, all his COVID-19 symptoms disappeared. His fever was gone, and he was no longer coughing up blood. Two days later, the doctor discharged him. More and More People Are Benefiting From This Mantra Together with Dr. Margaret Trey, we did a scientific presentation about these cases in the 6th International Conference on Spirituality and Psychology (ICSP2021) which was held virtually on March 13 through March 15, 2021. Less than two months ago, another friend in Vietnam emailed me about [his brother's recovery](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2022/4/11/199867.html) from not only from his depression but also unexpected improvement from presbyopia. He had shared the presentation webinar link in March 2021 and his brother watched out. In their previous conversations, he said he was, \"A man of science. I believe in hard, actual, scientific proof.\" He said that what he saw in the presentation struck a chord in him, and he started reciting the nine words and then he subsequently recovered quite unexpectedly. Does Reciting the Mantra Trigger Healing? We have scrutinized the causality analysis of reciting the mantra with clinical improvement. A comprehensive analysis includes failure to respond to conventional treatment, unexpected effects in severe and ICU patients, and short time to improvement and recovery. Some patients who acted as their own controls directed us to the same conclusion. The causality analyses are detailed here: Unexpected improvement: You may say that the patients' recovery occurred naturally, and would have occurred whether the patient recited the nine words or not. However, for these 37 cases, most of their symptoms have worsened before reciting the nine words, so self recovery would have been very unlikely. Their improvement and/or recovery happened only after they recited the mantra. Short time to recovery: The 36-case study showed that the median time for improvement was just one day with three days for complete recovery. Over 40 percent (n=15) improved within one day or overnight and 67 percent (n=24) improved within two days. The close temporal relationship between reciting the mantra and the clinical effects supports causality. The shorter time for improvement or recovery, the greater is the probability of the effect being attributed to the chanting or reciting of the nine word mantra. Same effects in people who opposed the content of the mantra: This indicated that the effects were real. Regardless of the patient's subjective views of the mantra, recovery or improvement manifested, thus implying objectivity. Controls: Case 15 recited the mantra and recovered. She stopped reciting the mantra and experienced symptom recurrence. After she resumed reciting the mantra, her symptoms improved again. With two other patients, their spouses acted as controls and also observed proof that the improvement and recovery effect were from reciting the mantra. Intra-spouse controls involved two couples from two different families. In both families, the couples developed COVID-19 symptoms at the same time. Initially, only one spouse recited the mantra and experienced symptom improvement within one day. The other spouse, who did not recite it, went to hospital and received symptomatic treatment, but symptoms worsened. The spouse eventually also began to recite the mantra and experienced a quick improvement. Of course, people may say that in the perspective of the [hierarchy of research methods,](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/21/4/125) case studies are near the bottom. But they are useful because they can provide rich, detailed data about one particular person's history and case. Randomized controlled studies (RCT) are required before claiming any effect. However, RCT have their own drawbacks including narrowly selected patients and are often far from real world practice. They're also expensive and usually take years to complete. Data from RCT may not necessarily translate into real world effects. RCT is not one-fit-for-all. If some people already benefited from a safe method, why not try it and heal yourself at no cost? Another possibility is that the individuals recovered in part because of the [placebo effect](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mental-health/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect) which is a beneficial effect produced by the belief that a treatment works (rather than by the treatment itself). If this is the case, yes, please feel free to use the placebo method and heal yourself. Some cases may see up to a 10 percent improvement from the placebo effect, however, a complete and swift recovery from the brink of death can hardly be explained by placebo. Chanting for Health: A Traditional Way of Healing How can people be healed just by speaking a few specific words? It seems far-fetched, but it is completely possible. These ideas aren't new in fact, they're very old. Several ancient traditions have proposed using vibrations to enhance health. For example, several Indic religions, including Hinduism, consider \"Om\" to be a sacred syllable and the greatest of all mantras. [Some believe](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/religion/mantras-chants/om-chanting-what-are-the-benefits-of-chanting-om-can-we-chant-om-silently/articleshow/76868162.cms) that chanting \"Om\" is beneficial for stomach health, calming the mind, and reducing stress. Audio therapy has been used by people to treat diseases. In worldwide traditional cultures, including Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, ancient India, and medieval Christianity, there have been many precedents for reciting mantras or spiritual words to achieve better physical and mental health and well-being or to cure illnesses. Biomedical research has identified the effects of mantra reciting on regulating physiological function and restoring health. [Rich](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40200-w) [scientific](https://doi.org/10.4103/0973-6131.78171) [research](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1446) have shown that the practice of mantra chanting has positive physiologic effects on the human body, including decreased heart rate, improved heart function, slower respiration, reduced anxiety or fear, and better sleep Modern [research](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.13748) has found that human speech carries neural oscillations that subserve a broad range of functions in speech processing and language comprehension. Vibrational Energy, Nervous System, Holistic Health So what's the link between speaking specific words and physical health? On the microscopic scale, our bodies are made of particles that are constantly in motion. We vibrate. Some believe that we can optimize our health by interacting with that vibrational energy. Physical therapies, like chanting, may play a role in regulating those vibrations, aligning our energy, and contributing to health. These therapies fall within the domain of [energy medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952118/). The vagus nerve connects organs throughout the neck, chest, and abdomen to the brain. It interfaces with the p [arasympathetic nervous system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538516/#:~:text=The%20parasympathetic%20nervous%20system%2C%20also,the%20pupil%20for%20near%20vision) which is the part of the nervous system that's responsible for calming us down and getting us ready to \"rest and digest.\" Electrical vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to facilitate healing in some circumstances. In a [two-year pilot study](https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/depression/outcome-vagus-nerve-stimulation-vns-treatment-major/) on 59 adult patients with depressive symptoms, vagus nerve stimulation was found to significantly improve depression scores for 42 percent of participants. Electrical vagus nerve stimulation is also [regularly used as a treatment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11940-010-0087-4) for individuals suffering from epilepsy. The above studies stimulated the vagus nerve using electricity. But in theory, chanting certain sounds can have the same stimulating effect on the vagus nerve. If so, we might find that chanting can also reduces activity in some brain regions, and thus produce a calming effect on the body. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099099/#CIT1) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) found exactly that. Researchers compared the effects of chanting \"Om\" to the effects of chanting \"ssss\"\u2014a sound that doesn't cause significant vibration. The researchers found that chanting \"Om\" led to significantly decreased activity in a number of brain regions including Nine Words? How Do They Work? The nine true words refers to nine is Good\" and \"Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is Good\". Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is an ancient Chinese spiritual meditation discipline for overall improvement of body, mind, and spirit. The teachings of Falun Gong emphasize the universal principles of \"Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance\", or \"Zhen-Shan-Ren\" in Chinese ( [ZHUAN FALUN](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdf)). Since its first introduction to the public in 1992, Falun Gong has become popular due to its extraordinary healing effects for people's physical and mental health. Due to its beneficial health effects, by 1999 there were about 100 million people practicing Falun Gong in mainland China. Now, it is practiced in over 100 countries worldwide. According to a China government sponsored [health survey](https://en.minghui.org/eng/science_eng/survey98_1eng.htm) conducted in 1998 in mainland China, out of 12,731 participants, 93.4 percent had ill conditions, and 49.8 percent had suffered from at least three type of diseases, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lung diseases, immune disorders or other difficult to treat, before they began practicing Falun Dafa. Through learning and practicing Falun Dafa, practitioners' health conditions improved to various degrees. The total effective cases reached 99.1 percent, among which the complete recovery rate was 58.5 percent and 96.5 percent of the total participants became psychologically healthier after practicing Falun Dafa. It is suggested that [Falun Gong](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdf) exudes a powerful positive energy field that can act to ward off illnesses and maintain fitness. A [study](https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2016.34.15_suppl.e21568) presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO) annual meeting in 2016 showed the significant benefits of practicing Falun Gong on end stage cancer, including significantly prolonged survival, and improved quality of life. These two books have also compiled stories of patients with end stage cancer or diseases without any therapeutic solutions who have been able to cure themselves after practicing Falun Dafa: \" [Life and Hope Renewed: The Healing Power of Falun Dafa](https://mhpublishing.org/products/life-and-hope-renewed)\" and \" [Hearts and Minds Uplifted: The Power of Falun Dafa](https://mhpublishing.org/products/hearts-and-minds-uplifted).\" It is suggested that Falun Gong exudes a powerful positive energy [field](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdf) that can act as a means of warding off illnesses and maintaining fitness. Many Falun Gong practitioners have reported experiencing this strong, high-energy field, which can produce extraordinary [healing effects.](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20824.2) From the perspective of [energy medicine](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20824.2), the action of a healing energy field can be instantaneous. This mantra also contains the high energy field of Falun Gong that can be transmitted to people who could sincerely speak it. Moreover, scientists from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, similarly found people who practiced Falun Gong's four standing and one sitting exercises had enhanced immune system function with enhanced phagocytosis and their [gene expression profiles indicated significantly enhanced anti-viral immunity](https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2005.11.29). Reciting the 9 Words Could Help\u2014It Won't Hurt Reciting these words is easy to learn, is safe, and does not conflict with any other types of treatment. Regardless what beliefs you may have, what views you may have of the mantra, you may still benefit from repeating it if you can repeat them sincerely. As many people are suffering from COVID-19 symptoms or jab-induced injuries and are not getting relief from other treatments, reciting the nine words certainly won't hurt. If you're suffering from COVID-19 symptoms or jab-induced injuries, and aren't getting relief from other therapies, why not give it a try? Find out how to recite the nine words [here](https://figshare.com/articles/media/Nine_True_Words_from_Falun_Gong/13600910/1) or [here](https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/06/03/Falun-Dafa-Nine-Words-Mantra.mp3). There is also a beautiful song from a young girl singing these nine words ( [audio file here](https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/06/03/Fa-Lun-Da-Fa-Hao-Zhen-Shan-Ren-Hao.mp3)). A video file for this beautiful song is also available via this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltc6aPK_wRI). We recommend that one please listen to these words as many times as possible till you can pronounce them correctly and use a journal to record your symptom changes on a daily basis. I also often recite these words whenever I feel tired, distressed, in a negative mood, or frustrated. It often works for me as well. This has been one of my secret tools during this pandemic that allowed me to have maintained health and energy after facing many challenges and having to be vaccinated twice with the Moderna vaccine so as to travel without restrictions. After I got my first shot, I felt heart pains and had a dizzy head, and healed myself two days after reading [Zhuan Falun](https://falundafa.org/) (the main text of Falun Dafa) and doing the second standing [exercise](https://en.falundafa.org/falun-dafa-video-audio.html) of Falun Gong every day. Taking the lesson learned from the first shot, when I got the second shot, I kept reciting the nine words sincerely for about 10 minutes; then I felt nothing uncomfortable at all. That is my personal self-control experiment of reciting these nine words. We will detail more insights into the mechanism of action of these nine words in more papers soon. To be frank, though, it is not easy to explain the effects of these nine words in modern scientific language. Furthermore, modern science is still developing itself, and it is not able to explain everything with its current theories. More and more traditional theories about healing, including mind-body holistic concepts and energy, are being proven to be correct. We really care about the health and wellness of all people around the world. As more evidence emerges to support the real significant healing effects of the nine words: Falun Dafa Hao; Zhen, Shan Ren Hao, we want to share this safe and effective method of healing with everyone.
