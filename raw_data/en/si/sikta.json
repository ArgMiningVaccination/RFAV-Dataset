On December 4, 2021, there were 5,327 cases of PCR positives while Japan had only 131 cases even though the population of Japan is about 2.5 times greater than that of Korea (Korea 53 million vs. Japan 130 million); this means that Korea has almost 100-times more outbreaks of PCR positive cases than that of Japan. On that day, more than 70 people died of COVID-19 while Japan had none [2]. Th is means that Korean government has a very poor COVID-19 policy and the Korean Government behaves very badly against the COVID-19 attacks in Korea. In South Korea, the COVID-19 treatment protocol using HCQ + AZM (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin) was almost annihilated aft er the COVID-19 National Strategic Meeting on June 25, 2020. In that meeting, an HCQ + AZM protocol was victimized as causing a 2.93 fold increase of mortality in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Th e false information was based upon a \"monumental fraud\" Lancet study, which was retracted because of its data fabrication [3,4]. Th ere was a report on problems of not-using Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for COVID-19 patients, and was suggested that about 71% of the total death could be reduced if HCQ was used for the early treatment of COVID-19 patients [5]. PRESS CONFERENCE BY KOREA VERITAS DOCTORS Korea Veritas Doctors for COVID-19 are presenting (a) actively moving unknown live micro-organisms in the contents of Pfi zer vaccine vials (Figures 1a-c) [6]; (b) questionable dark and thick graphene-like (Figure 1d), metal-like particles (Figure 1e), and graphene-or-a worm-like subject (Figure 1f). In addition, we introduce prevention, early treatment cocktail protocols for COVID-19 and detoxifying methods for COVID-19 vaccines (Table 1). BREAKTHROUGH CASES OF COVID-19 VACCINES 44 breakthrough COVID-19 patients are presented (Table 2). Th e treatment cocktails for the 44 COVID-19 patients in a rural area of Kyunggi Province, South Korea, is described in table 1. Among the 72 inmates of the nursing home, 2 persons were not vaccinated, 3 got 1 st ABSTRACT Korea Veritas Doctors for COVID-19 are reporting two important ndings: (a) actively moving unknown live micro-organisms were found in the COVID-19 Vaccine vials (b) a treatment cocktail for 44 COVID-19 outbreak patients was administered and worked successfully. In our opinion all the contents of the COVID-19 vaccines should be thoroughly studied and irrational and harmful COVID-19 vaccinations should be stopped. As a result baseless Vaccine Pass Policy should be stopped. COVID-19 prevention and treatment cocktails should replace the harmful COVID-19 vaccines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Sequels and the harmful e ects of the COVID-19 vaccines should be addressed by detoxi cations methods.

Th e HCQ + Azithromycin cocktail treatment showed excellent treatment results: among the 43 breakthrough cases, only one person died; and among the 44 persons of over the 60-year-old, one person died and another person died due to fasting. Th e local outbreak began from December 3, 2021, continued to December 25, 2021, and lasted for 23 days. Th e mortality ratio of over the 60-year-old was one out of 43 (2.33%) at this nursing home outbreak through the HCQ + AZM cocktail treatment, and that of the national ratio was 3.38% as of December 26, 2021. Th is means that the HCQ + AZM treatment cocktail can be used as a standard method for the early treatment of COIVD-19 patients. TWO FACETS OF COVID-19 VACCINES According to the six months safety and effi cacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine study, the Pfi zer vaccine killed 5 people to save one COVID death, even though statistically not signifi cant [8]. VAERS data showed a statistically signifi cant result that Pfi zer vaccine kills more people than it saves: at least 2 people die when Pfi zer vaccine saves one life [9]. It also showed that 71-fold increase of the cardiac arrest and death cases shortly aft er COVID-19 vaccination compared to that of average over 5 years for all vaccines ([57/4] *5 = 71-fold) [9]. Th e cumulative total death of COVID-19 vaccination is 1,552 persons, total number of adverse reactions 411,038 cases, severe adverse reactions of 15,167 cases as of December 30, 2021, and total death of 1,252 persons, total adverse reactions 374,200 cases, and severe cases of 13,418 cases as of November 18, 2021 according to the COVID-19 Vaccination Report of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency [10]. Th e Korean Government insists that the severity ratio is higher in the unvaccinated (6,824/207,155 = 3.28%) compared to the vaccinated (279 /44,289 = 0.63%) without counting the adverse eff ects of the COVID-19 vaccines. Th e Government is looking only one facet of COVID-19 vaccines. Th e other facet of the COVID-19 showed totally diff erent features. COVID-19 vaccines caused 1,252 deaths, 374,200 side eff ects, and 13,418 severe adverse reactions including death and anaphylaxis as of November 18, 2021. We need to add these two kinds of data of the two diff erent facets of the COVID-19 vaccines to know the real eff ects of the COVID-19 vaccines. Th e severity is higher in the vaccinated as ([confi rmed cases 44,289 + number of adverse reactions 374,200] = 418,489) compared to confi rmed cases in the unvaccinated (207,155). Also, the severity is higher in the vaccinated as ([death and severe cases 279 + number of death and severe adverse reactions with COVID-19 vaccines 13,418] = 13,697) compared to death and severe cases of the unvaccinated (6,814 cases). So, the vaccinated has a two-fold increase of severity than that the unvaccinated both in the occurrence of COVID-19 cases and of the severe cases or death. DETOXIFICATION OF COVID-19 VACCINES Subacute dermatologic problems such as eczematous or scaly lesions which occurred aft er COVID-19 vaccines were usually resilient and reluctant to respond to the prescriptions of dermatologists (Figure 4). Th e lesions improved progressively with the detoxifying methods for COVID-19 vaccines for one month. But those skin lesions reaggravated when stopped for one week the detoxifying treatment. So, the lesions may need to detoxify at least for 4 months and needs to be followed up. Also, neurologic pathologies such as near paralysis of extremities, diffi cult to walk, sudden unknown convulsive movements, and autonomic palpitations of the extremities, were improved with detoxifi cation methods written in the table 1. Abnormal neurologic features may include anosmia, stroke, paralysis, decreased eye function, facial numbness, and depression were diffi cult to cure by the usual and classic rehabilitation methods [11]. Intensity, frequency, and duration of myopericarditis symptoms aft er the COVID-19 vaccinations such as dyspnea, chest Figure 2: Skin lesions which occurred after COVID-19 vaccines. They were usually resilient and reluctant to respond to the prescriptions of dermatologists. They were improved with detoxifying methods for the COVID-19 vaccines.SCIRES Literature - Volume 6 Issue 1 - www.scireslit.com Page - 005ISSN: 2644-0032American Journal of Epidemiology & Public Health https://dx.doi.org/10.37871/ajeph.id50 DOI: Figure 3: Living organisms extracted by a foot immersion bathing method. The rst-row shows various kinds of living organisms extracted through a foot immersion bathing. The second-row shows a questionable parasite-like living organisms with an egg pouch and an egg-pouch or a Morgellons with hair-like graphene The third-row Morgellons with hair-like graphene oxide and an egg pouch. Currently, this kind of Foot Immersion Bathing are booming in Korea. These pictures were posted by a Moderna COVID-19 injected person who had experienced nerve paresis and could not even walk. After a detoxi cation treatment, her paresis was mostly gone, and she participates in the Anti-COVID-19 vaccination rally. Figure 4: Materials necessary for the foot immersion bathing and some extracted organisms through the foot immersion bathing. For those who have severe adverse reactions by COVID-19 vaccines, whole-body immersion bathing is recommended instead of a foot immersion bathing. For the whole- body immersion bathing, 4.5 kg of bay salt is melted with a 500 ml vinegar in the half-hot water- lled bath. At rst, the bathing time should not be over 15 minutes, and the progressively increase until one hour at a time. For the foot immersion bathing, pour hot water in a basin to the height of malleolus of the ankle. Then pour three-cups of bay salt and one cup of vinegar. Remove all the impure foreign materials in the water to make it clear as pure water. The temperature of the basin water should be as warm as 42-45\u00b0C. Then Immerge your feet in the prepared water for about 25 minutes. Before this procedure, you need to wash your feet clearly. Remove your feet from the water of Immersion Bathing, then observe the water about 15 minutes. If you nd out 1-3 small spots, speckles, rods, or spirals, carefully and selectively collect them on the white A4 paper. Then observe with the digital microscope at X1000 microscopic magnifying power. Pictures of the rst-row show the water of the Foot Immersion Bathing, and foreign organisms that were extracted through the Foot Immersion Bathing. The second-row shows X400 microscopic pictures of the materials which were extracted from a patient who were experiencing adverse reactions because of COVID-19 vaccine. The microscopic pictures show an insect-like object and a newly-formed blood clot. The third-row shows somewhat hydra-like parasites, Morgellons, an EMF (Electro-magnetic eld) bucket, and a person who were doing the foot immersion bathing.SCIRES Literature - Volume 6 Issue 1 - www.scireslit.com Page - 006ISSN: 2644-0032American Journal of Epidemiology & Public Health https://dx.doi.org/10.37871/ajeph.id50 DOI:tightness, tearing and needling pain in the chest decreased by a half aft er 3 weeks of detoxifying methods. EXTRACTS THROUGH THE FOOT IMMERSION BATHING We can extract various subjects through the foot immersion bathing for from 25 minutes to 1 hour. Th e fi rst case in South Korea started from October 22, 2021 by Haemin Cho and this extraction method nation-widely boomed in a short time and many people are posting their self-extracted fi gures [12]. Th is method is a promising one for the extraction of some deadly materials that could be originated from COVID-19 vaccines or outside world such as Chemtrails, foods, or drugs. Morgellons with hair-like graphene oxide and an egg pouch, blood clots, questionable parasite-like living organisms with an egg pouch, metal-like materials were posted (Figure 3) which were extracted through the foot immersion bathing (Figure 4). Surprisingly, it looked that some of the parasite-like organisms attached to magnets. But we need to study further about the nature of these living organisms and how to eradicate them. REFERENCES 1.
