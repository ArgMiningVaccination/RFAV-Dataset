During Cedarville University's fall break, a group of 12 students drove more than 15 hours to Fort Myers, Florida, to clear debris from Hurricane Ian's devastating tear through the state. Among the 12 students who participated was Ethan Kelly, of Plainfield. \"It was pretty heartbreaking to look around and see so many memories turned into what is now debris\" said senior Chloe Metaxotos from Merrimack, New Hampshire. \"It was truly fulfilling to help people in the name of Christ, while being there in their suffering and grieving.
