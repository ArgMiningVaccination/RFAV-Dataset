USCIS hereby designates UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center as a Regional Center within the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program and approves the request as described below: FOCUS OF INVESTMENT ACTIVITY: As depicted in the economic model, the general proposal, business plan and associated economic analysis, the Regional Center will engage in the following economic activities: to purchase capital equipment for industry clusters in the Regional Center. The Regional Center shall focus on offering EB-5 compliant capital investment opportunities into new commercial enterprises or a mix of commercial enterprises in the following target industry economic clusters: 1. NAICS 11 2. NAICS 711 8. NAICS 22112 9. NAICS 53 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting Manufacturing Construction Machinery Manufacturing Mining Machinery Manufacturing Aerospace Product & Parts Manufacturing Information Research and Development in Biotechnology Electric Power Transmission, Control, and Distribution Real Estate www.uscis.gov (, UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center/RCW1 031910017 I (formerly W0900 17 60) \u00b7 Page 2 If any investment opportunities arise that are beyond the scope of the approved industry clusters, then an amendment would be required to add that cluster. GEOGRAPHIC AREA: The UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center shall have a geographic scope to include the entire state of North Dakota and 20 counties in Northwestern Minnesota, which includes Kittson, Roseau, Marshall, Pennington, Beltrami, Red Lake, Polk, Norman, Clay, Otter Tail, Douglas, Pope, Traverse, Stevens, Wilkin, Becker, Mahnomen, Clearwater, Grant, and Lake of the Woods. The geographic focus of this area may contain some High Unemployment Targeted Employment Areas (TEAs) as designated by the States of North Dakota and Minnesota and rural TEAs, as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(e). Therefore, the minimum capital investment threshold for any individual immigrant investment into an approved commercial enterprise throughout the Regional Center shall be not less than $500,000, if the investment target is located within a TEA or $1,000,000 if it is located outside of a TEA. No debt arrangement will be acceptable unless it is secured by assets owned by the alien entrepreneur. A full capital inves~ment must be made and placed at risk. For any alien requesting the reduced threshold of $500,000 based upon an investment in a Targeted Employment area, the alien must establish at the time of filing of the I-52 6 petition that either the investment will be made in a TEA designated area or was in a TEA designated area at the time of the alien's initial investment into the enterprise. EMPLOYMENT CREATION The econometric model is IMPLAN. Immigrant investors who file petitions for capital investments in new commercial enterprises located within and affiliated with the Regional Center area must fulfill all of the requirements set forth in INA 203 (b) (5), 8 CFR 204.6, and 8 CFR 216.6, except that the petition need not show that the new commercial enterprises created ten new jobs directly as a result of the immigrant investor's investment. The determination whether the alien investor has met the job creation requirements will be established by a review of the required initial evidence at 8 CFR 204.6(j) and 8 CFR 216.6(a) ( 4) for the Form I-526 and Form I-829 petitions, respectively. The capital investment and job creation activities outlined in the individual petitions must fall within the bounds of the final economic analysis that is contained as part of the approved Regional Center proposal and its indirect job creation model and multipliers contained within the final approved Regional Center application package. The immigrant investor must show at the time of removal of conditions that they performed the activities described in Form I-526 petition, and the activities must be based on the approved regional center methodology for demonstrating job creation. In addition, where job creation or preservation of existing jobs is claimed based on a multiplier rooted in underlying new \"direct jobs\", the immigrant investor's individual I-526 petition affiliated with your Regional Center, should include as supporting evidence: A comprehensive detailed business plan with supporting financial, marketing and related data and analysis providing a reasonable basis for projecting creation of any new direct jobs for \"qualifying employees\" to be achieved/realized within two years pursuant to 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(B). (i UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center/RCWI 03I9I 00 I7 I (formerly W0900 I7 60) Page 3 An alien investor's 1-829 petition to remove the conditions which was based on an 1-526 petition approval that involved the creation of new direct jobs or the creation of new indirect jobs based on a multiplier tied to underlying new direct jobs needs to be properly supported by evidence of job creation. To support the full number of direct and indirect new jobs being claimed in connection with removal of conditions, the petition will need to be supported by probative evidence of the number of new direct full time (35 hours per week) jobs for qualified employees whose positions have been created as a result of the alien's investment. Such evidence may include copies of quarterly state employment tax reports, Forms W-2, Forms 1-9, and any other pertinent employment records sufficient to demonstrate the number of qualified employees whose jobs were created directly. Additional Guidelines for individual Immigrant Investors Visa Petition (I-526) Each individual petition, in order to demonstrate that it is associated with the Regional Center, in conjunction with addressing all the requirements for an individual immigrant investor petition, shall also contain as supporting evidence relating to this Regional Center designation, the following: I . A copy of this letter, the Regional Center approval and designation. 2. A copy of the USCIS approved Regional Center narrative proposal and business plan. 3. A copy of the job creation methodology required in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(iii), as contained in the final Regional Center economic analysis which has been approved by USCIS, whichreflects that investment by an individual immigrant investor will create not fewer than ten (I 0) full-time employment positions, either directly or indirectly, per immigrant investor. 4. A legally executed copy of the following documents if issued to the EB-5 Immigrant Investor: a. Private Placement Memorandum b. Subscription Agreement c. Operating Agreement d. Escrow Agreement e. Limited Partnership Agreement Not Reviewed Not Reviewed Not Reviewed Not Reviewed Not Reviewed Note that these documents must be submitted with any 1-526 petition filed for any alien whose investment funds will be used for investment projects in the UND Center for Innovation Regional Center. DESIGNEE'S RESPONSIBILITIES INHERENT IN CONDUCT OF THE REGIONAL CENTER: The law, as reflected in the regulations at 8 CFR 204.6(m)(6), requires that an approved Regional Center in order to maintain the validity of its approval and designation must continue to meet the statutory requirements of the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program by serving the purpose of promoting economic growth, including increased export sales (where applicable), improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment. Therefore, in order for USCIS to determine whether your Regional Center is in compliance with the above cited regulation, and in order to continue to operate as a USCIS approved and designated Regional Center, your administration, oversight, and management of your Regional Center shall be such as to monitor all investment activities under the sponsorship of your Regional Center and to maintain records, data and information in order to provide the information required on the Form I-924A supplement. Form I-924A, Supplement to Form 1-924 is available in the \"Forms\" section on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov. 't UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center/RCW1 031910017 I (formerly W0900 17 60) ' Page 4 Effective November 23, 2010, the failure to timely file a Form I-924A Supplement for each fiscal years in which the regional center has been designated for participation in the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program will result in the issuance of an intent to terminate the participation of the regional center in the Pilot Program, which may ultimately result in the termination of the approval and designation of the regional center. Note: The requirement for the filing of Form I-924A Supplement commences in fiscal year 2011. Each regional center that remains designated for participation in the pilot program as of September 3 0, 2 0 11 must submit the Form I-924A Supplement with the required supporting documentation on or before December 29, 2011.

UNO CENTER FOR INNOVATION FOUNDATION NORTH DAKOTA/NORTHWEST MINNESOTA EB-5 REGIONAL CENTER MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPEAL INTRODUCTION The UNO Center for Innovation Foundation,proposed to be designated as a regional center under the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program (\"Proposal\"}. The Proposal seeks designation of the state of North Dakota and 20 counties of Northwestern Minnesota in 7 industry sectors. USCIS denied the application for a regional center designation by notice dated January 19, 2011 (\"Denial Notice\"}. The UNO Center for Innovation Foundation appeals the decision, and submits additional information to support its application for a regional center designation. We understand that the USCIS California Service Center will review our additional information, prior to sending our appeal to the Administrative Appeals Office, for purposes of considering whether in light of such information, the UNO Center for Innovation Foundation is eligible for designation as a regional center. REGIONAL OR NATIONAL IMPACT OF THE REGIONAL CENTER The Denial Notice faults the Proposal for lacking sufficient analysis of the regional or national impact of regional center activities, as reflected in such factors as increased household earnings, demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction. (Denial Notice, p. 2}. Accompanying our appeal is further information to demonstrate regional or national impact of regional center activities, namely the pertinent sections of the \"Economic Analysis of the North Dakota/Northwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Center\" by Cullen F. Goenner, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Economics at the University of North Dakota, dated February 14, 2011 (\"Economic Analysis\"}. In Dr. Goenner's Economic Analysis, at pages 18 to 21, he estimates positive regional center impacts for each of the 7 sectors as reflected in the following factors: Regional & National Impact Results by Sector (including Output, Household Earnings, Indirect Business Taxes, and Total Jobs} Demand for Business Services Demand for Utilities Demand for Maintenance and Repair Demand for Construction 1 ~' These sections of the Economic Analysis address directly the insufficiencies noted by USCIS in the Denial Notice. Note that the Economic Analysis supplements and confirms the information on regional impacts that was previously submitted in support of the response to the Request for Evidence-\u00ad the \"Revised IMPLAN Proposal\" co-authored by Dr. Goenner and Ralph Kingsbury, the Consulting Economist, dated December 21, 2010. The Revised IMPLAN Proposal estimated regional impacts in terms of Output, Employment and Household Earnings for each of the 7 proposed sectors. Furthermore, the Revised IMPLAN Proposal estimated regional impacts, (Revised IMPLAN Proposal, p. 11). The Denial Notice observes: \"Although a business plan was submitted for the regional center, the proposal did not include a prediction regarding the manner in which the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy in general as reflected by such factors as increased household earnings ... \" (Denial Notice, p. 2, added italics) But it is the Revised 1M PLAN Proposal, not the business plan, that addressed these factors-\u00ad albeit not in the detail that Dr. Goenner's current Economic Analysis covers the subject matter. Given the new material in the form of Dr. Goenner's Economic Analysis, USCIS should conclude that this factor has been satisfied. JOB CREATION The Denial Notice faults the Proposal for lacking sufficient analysis of job creation (Denial Notice, p. 3-4). Of primary emphasis, the Denial Notice states: \"The proposal identified seven industry clusters for job creation but did not identify the projects and investments for which EB-5 investor funds will be used.\" To rectify this deficiency, below we identify sample investments for each of the 7 industry sectors. In each case, we identify the name of the company, its industry sector, the amount of capital to be raised, the uses of the capital, and the estimated job creation. Although none of these sample investments is under contract due to the lengthy delay involved between now and the time EB-5 capital actually could be available to a target company, we have engaged in serious discussions with these target companies about their specific capital needs, uses of the EB-5 capital, and the requirement to prove job creation. In a similar vein, the Denial Notice states: 2 (b) (4) \"The Economic Analysis that was submitted with the proposal (i.e., the Revised IMPLAN Proposal) appears to be generic in nature and focuses simply on the job creation impacts for the industry clusters rather than the job creation impacts for the industry clusters in a project or investment based on a $1,000,000 capital investment.\" This particular deficiency is addressed in the new Economic Analysis by Dr. Goenner. In the new Economic Analysis Dr. Goenner estimates the job creation for each of the sample investments in each of the 7 industry sectors, based on the company targets and terms of investment that we outline herein. As a final note to this part of the Denial Notice, there should be little doubt that \"the capital investments proposed are compatible with community plans and goals for economic development in the area.\" (Denial Notice, p. 4) Given the materials that have been submitted in support of the Proposal, it is difficult to understand how the USCIS does not recognize that the 7 proposed industry sectors are selected precisely for the reason that they are vital to the future of the North Dakota-Northwest Minnesota economy, and that the UNO Center for Innovation has a track record and long history of vetting business proposals, matching opportunities with capital investment, and promoting innovation and job creation in our region of the country. What the UNO Center for Innovation Foundation is proposing to do with its regional center, if designated by USCIS, is not significantly different from what it is chartered to do-create jobs and foster regional economic development consistent with regional goals. Proposed Investments in Industry Sectors We have identified multiple enterprises interested in pursuing EB-5 investment during the application process to become a designated EB-5 Regional Center for North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota. At least one business was identified in each one of the industry sectors presented (Agri-business, Bioscience, Manufacturing, IT/Telecommunications, Aviation/Aerospace, Real Estate Development, and Utilities). In addition, according to our 1M PLAN analysis, the minimum amount of EB-5 investment made in these potential projects, i.e. $1,000,000, or$ $500,000 if located in a TEA, would generate the necessary 10 direct or indirect jobs per investment. These target businesses a~e also located within our designated region, the state of North Dakota and 20 counties of Northwest Minnesota. 3 (b) (4) Preliminary conversations with these local enterprises have taken place in order to explain the EB-5 Pilot Program, gather information regarding their operations, determine their potential for EB-5 investment, and discuss the amount of funds being sought out by the local enterprise and the intended use of the funds. The listing below gives examples of local enterprises interested in EB-5 investment in each of the industries.

UTILITIES (Power Generation) Local Enterprise Name: RENEWABLE CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS, LLC-website pending Local Enterprise Description: Renewable Chemical Solutions (RCS) will commercialize proprietary technology used to produce bio fuels, chemicals, and bio polymers from renewable feedstock sources. RCS was established to serve as the commercialization vehicle for technologies produced by the SUNRISE research group through the University of North Dakota (UNO). RCS has entered into an 8 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) agreement to acquire exclusive licensing rights for a suite of technologies invented and developed at UNO. RCS is housed at the UNO Center for Innovation's Technology Incubator and has built a pilot plant center at the UNO Research Foundation's Advanced Technologies and Life Sciences Laboratory. This pilot plant center will be used to define the final design of the demonstration facility and economic data associated with RCS-Iicensed technologies. A seven million gallon per year demonstration scale crop oil refinery facility will be constructed in collaboration with industrial partners scheduled for commission by year end 2012. The demonstration scale facility will be used to showcase the technology for worldwide licensing opportunities as well as to optimize the process design. EB-5 would be used to partially fund this project, and possible its expansion phases in the near future. RCS first-to-market products are based on UNO proprietary technologies. These technologies are based on utilizing crop oils such as soybean, canota and/or jatropha to create its products. RCS have multiple categories of products, the first category being fuel related products such as 1) a cold flow improvement additive for biodiesel users, 2) a boutique biodiesel fuel for off-road vehicles, specifically targeting the farm tractor market, 3) a certified biodiesel fuel equivalent to diesel No.1, 4) a syngas fuel used to generate electricity, and 5) a certified aviation turbine fuel equivalent to commercial fuel Jet A and military fuel JP-8. This fifth product, JB100, is currently considered the most attractive ultimate initial product market. JB100 is a jet turbine fuel made from crop oils such as soybean and canota that matches the cold-flow and combustion quality standards of petroleum-based jet fuel and can achieve burn stability at -50\u00b0C (-58\u00b0F). RCS largest market is jet fuel and according to the market research reported by several oil companies and the United States Department of Energy, the yearly jet fuel market in the USA is approximately 26 billion gallons. DESC, the agency that procures fuel for all branches of the military, has a mandate to procure 20% of its fuel supply from domestic renewable sources by 2020. In FY02 the military used over 5.5 billion gallons of jet fuel. DESC has indicated that it will accept fuel from multiple suppliers as long as it meets the specification and RCS can demonstrate that the process creates compliant products. RCS's other products have smaller, more fragmented markets, so RCS will strategically launch products that provide higher margins in less competitive spaces. Investment Size: Total estimate cost of the pilot bio-fuel facility is Investment Purpose: Funds will be used to build a bio-fuels refinery in the state of North Dakota. This will be initially a test pilot project, able to produce up to 7 million gallons of jet bio-fuels. The company has plans to expand this facility, being able to double or triple its production capacity in the near future. Northwood, ND is the site chosen to develop this project. The company has shown strong interest in funding parts of this project using EB-5 investment. Total investment could generate positions, including direct and indirect jobs. Conversations are on hold until the ND/NW-M N EB-5 RC application is approved. ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT The Denial Notice faults the Proposal for lacking sufficient details and explanation of the administrative oversight of regional center activities (Denial Notice, p. 5). While the Proposal has included certain concrete information relating to administrative oversight- for example, how it identifies investment opportunities (in the response to the RFE, Revised Business Plan, p. 18-20)-and has explained that investments in businesses will not be limited to EB-5 investors 9 (b) (4) (b) (4) but would include co-investment from domestic sources (Revised Business Plan, p. 22, 24-5), a comprehensive treatment of this subject is presented in the Commitment to Administrative Oversight document accompanying this appeal. There, we clarify how UNO Center for Innovation Foundation will carry out monitoring of regional center activities and maintain records for USCIS reporting. CONCLUSION Considering all the documentation submitted with the Proposal, including in response to the RFE and in support ofthis appeal, the request ofthe UNO Center for Innovation Foundation for regional center designation should be approved. ,. ~-\u00b7 \u00b7:m.\u00b7\u00b7~\u00b7~\u00b7 .~ '. e I:' l, -\u00b7' Bruce Gjovi~O \u00b7 UNO CENTER FOR INNOVATION FOUNDATION 10 ~TONE & GRZEGOREK LLP February 22, 2011 Delivered via Courier U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services California Service Center 24000 Avila Road, 2nd Floor Laguna Niguel, CA 92607-1052 Re: Appeal of Regional Center Proposal Denial 800 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 900 Los Angeles CA 90017 tel 213 627 File: RCW1031910017 I W09001760 Form I-290B- Notice of Appeal or Motion Dear Examiner: Please find enclosed our filing fee check of $630 and our Appeal from your Notice of Decision dated January 19,2011: Notice ofDecision Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, Form G-28 Notice of Appeal or Motion, Form I-290B \"Memorandum In Support of Appeal\" by UND Center for Innovation Foundation \"Economic Analysis of the North Dakota/Northwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Cullen F.

Sincerely, Rosemary Langley Melville Director, California Service Center cc: North Dakota Center for Innovation Foundation RC Page 2 This Notice is in reference to the Regional Center Proposal that was filed with the Director, California Service Center, on April 22, 2010, seeking designation as a Regional Center pursuant to Pilot Immigration Program under Section 61 0 of P .L. 1 0 2-3 9 5 and as amended by P .L. 1 0 7-2 7 3. On September 29, 2010, 2010 the USCIS issued Form I-797 Notice of Action requesting evidence in support of the Regional Center Proposal ftled on April 2 2, 2 0 1 0. The USCIS noted the request did not contain sufficient evidence showing that the proposed regional center would meet the regulatory requirements as a Regional Center. Multiple issues were addressed in the request for evidence and the evidentiary requirements for each of these issues were explained in detail. However, the evidence provided in response to the USCIS request did not establish eligibility under the Pilot Immigrant Investor Program. The University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center has requested designation as a Regional Center to be located within the entire state of North Dakota and 20 counties in Northwestern Minnesota, which includes Kittson, Roseau, Marshall, Pennington, Beltrami, Red Lake, Polk, Norman, Clay, Otter Tail, Douglas, Pope, Traverse, Stevens, Wilkin, Becker, Malmomen, Clearwater, Grant, and Lake of the Woods. Capital investment will be used to invest in several target industries: agribusiness, advanced manufacturing, aviation/ aerospace, information teclmologies/ communications, construction and real estate development (rural/urban renewal/multi-mixed use), biotech/bioscience, and utilities (electric power generation). The Regional or National Impact of the Regional Center Under 8 CFR \u00a7 204.6(m)(3) (iv), a regional center proposal must contain a prediction regarding the manner in which the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy in general as reflected by such factors as increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and outside of the regional center.\u00b7 This requirement means that the proposal must analyze the impact of regional center activities. Although a business plan was submitted for the regional center, the proposal did not include a prediction regarding the manner in which the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy in general as reflected by such factors as increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and outside of the regional center. The business plan did not address specific factors like increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair and construction both within and outside of the regional center but rather overall impact of output, employment and household earnings by each sector such as agribusiness, advanced manufacturing, aviation/ aerospace, infonnation technologies/ communications, biotech/bioscience,, construction and real estate development (rural/urban renewal/multi-mixed use), and utilities (electric power generation). Therefore, the regional or national impact of the regional center has not been demonstrated. ATTACHMENT 1-171 RCWl 0319100 17/W09001760/University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Foundation RC Page 3 Job Creation Section 610(a) ofP.L. 102-395 as amended by P.L. 107-273 describes the statutory basis for eligibility as a Regional Center a) Of the visas otherwise available under section 203 (b)(S) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 11 S3(b)(5)), the Secretary of State, together with the Attorney General, shall set aside visas for a pilot program to implement the provisions of such section .... The establishment of a regional center may be based on general predictions, contained in the proposal. concerning the kinds of commercial enterprises that will receive capital from aliens, the jobs that will be created directly or indirectly as a result of such capital investments and the other positive economic effects such capital investments will have ... Moreover, 8 C.F.R. 204.6(e) states in pertinent part: Commercial enterprise means any for-profit activity formed for the ongoing conduct of lawful business including, but not limited to, a sole proprietorship, partnership (whether limited or general), holding company, joint venture, corporation, business trust, or other entity which may be publicly or privately owned. This definition includes a commercial enterprise consisting of a holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, provided that each such subsidiary is engaged in a for-profit activity formed for the ongoing conduct of a lawful business. This definition shall not include a non-commercial activity such as owning and operating a personal residence. A regional center proposal must be supported by economically or statistically valid forecasting tools, including, but not limited to, feasibility studies, analyses of foreign and domestic markets for the goods or services to be exported, and job creation multipliers related both geographically and by job type. This requirement that a proposal include the valid multipliers applicable to an identified economic activity and job type is in accordance with the regulatory requirements, in particular, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.6(m)(3)(ii). Whether a proposed regional center will foster sufficient job-creation and economic benefits to justify the regional center designation is an issue to be detennined by USCIS during the course of evaluating regional center proposals. Regional center proposals should include evidence of the proposed regional center's evaluative economic models, feasibility studies regarding projects and investments that are to take place within the geographic area of the proposed regional center, as well as statements and attestations from interested and supportive public agencies and private organizations located within the area of the regional center. In the instant proposal, University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Renovation Foundation Regional Center will use capital investment to invest in several target industries: agribusiness, advanced manufacturing, aviation/ aerospace, information technologies/ communications, biotech/bioscience,, construction and real estate development (rural/urban renewal/multi-mixed use), and utilities (electric power generation). ATTACHMENT 1-171 RCWl 03 I 910017 /W0900I760/University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Foundation RC Page 4 Although the proposal included a Business Plan and a revised Economic Analysis (see Revised IMPLAN Proposal), the proposal did not show how EB-5 investor funds will be capitalized in a manner that will create at least I 0 full-time jobs per EB-5 investor. The proposal identified seven industry clusters for job creation but did not identify the projects and investments for which EB-5 investor funds will be used. Without knowing the projects and investments in the regional center, users cannot make a determination as to whether invesunent capital will be utilized in a manner that will create the requisite jobs. In tandem with the identification of the investments and projects, the proposal does not contain any evaluative economic models and feasibility studies regarding the projects and invesnnents that are to take place within the designated geographic area of the proposed regional center. The Economic Analysis that was submitted with the proposal appears to be generic in nature and focuses simply on the job creation impacts for the industry clusters rather than the job creation impacts for the industry clusters in a project or investment based on a $1,000,000 capital investment. Such evidence would not only meet a basic requirement for a regional center, but also would be useful in establishing that the capital investments proposed are compatible with community plans and goals for economic development in the area. Further, the proposal does not show how the capital funds will flow from the investor (both EB-5 and non EB-5) to the job-creating entity. . USCIS cannot determine whether investment capital will actually flow from the investor to the job-creating enterprise. Moreover, the proposal does not show how the jobs will be created even though the Economic Analysis projects that at least ten ( 1 0) (direct and/ or indirect) full-time jobs will be created in each industry duster based on the expenditure of a $1,000,000 capital investment (see Pages 2 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10 of the Revised IMPLAN Proposal). The proposal further states that capital funds will be used for manufacturing but the proposal is not dear as to what this means (see Pages 2 3, 5, 6, 7 and 1 0 of the Revised IMPLAN Proposal). Without knowing the job-creating activities that the regional center will be engaged in, USCIS cannot determine whether investment capital will be utilized in a manner that will create the requisite jobs. Therefore, without knowing the kinds of investment projects, the flow of capital, or how the jobs w.ill be created, USCIS cannot determine whether the investment capital will be utilized in a manner that will create the requisite jobs. In light of these facts, the proposal fails to show that the investment vehicles to be undertaken by University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Renovation Foundation Regional Center can reasonably be expected to provide the requisite permanent, full-time job-creation and create positive economic impact from EB-5 alien investors.

Summary 22 2 1-1 BACKGROUND The proposed North Dakota/ Northwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Center {ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC) is designated to target foreign investment in seven industry clusters, which include: 1. Agribusiness, 2. Manufacturing, 3. Aviation/Aerospace, 4. Information Technology, 5. Biotechnology, 6. Energy generation, and 7. Real Estate Development. The business plan of the proposed center calls for the funds of foreign investors to be used to purchase. capital equipment in a particular industry. Using the capital intensity of the industry, based of Bureau of Economic Analysis data, one is able to determine the direct contribution to output for a given investment. lmplan is then used to determine the economic impact on output, employment, and household earnings within the region and the United States. 1-2 INDUSTRY DESCRIPTIONS Agribusiness-- NAICS sector 11 (Ag, Forestry, Fishing & hunting) comprises establishments primarily engaged in growing crops, raising animals, harvesting timber, and harvesting fish and other animals from a farm, ranch, or their natural habitats. The establishments in this sector are often described as farms, ranches, dairies, greenhouses, nurseries, orchards, or hatcheries. A farm may consist of a single tract of land or a number of separate tracts which may be held under different tenures. For example, one tract may be owned by the farm operator and another rented. It may be operated by the operator alone or with the assistance of members of the household or hired employees, or it may be operated by a partnership, corporation, or other type of organization. When a landowner has one or more tenants, renters, croppers, or managers, the land operated by each is considered a farm. Sample analysis was completed for an investment in capital goods {machinery & equipment) used to produce sunflowers, NAICS sector 1111. Manufacturing-- NAICS sectors 31-33 (Agriculture, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing) comprises establishments engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products. The assembling of component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in Sector 23, Construction. 3 Establishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. However, establishments that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the workers home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, may also be included in this sector. Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other establishments to process their materials for them. Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing. Sample analysis was completed for an investment in capital goods (machinery & equipment) used to manufacture farm machinery and equipment, NAICS sector 3331. Aviation/Aerospace-- NAICS sector 3364 (Aerospace Product and Parts Manufacturing) comprises establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the following: {1) manufacturing complete aircraft, missiles, or space vehicles; {2) manufacturing aerospace engines, propulsion units, auxiliary equipment or parts; {3) developing and making prototypes of aerospace products; {4) aircraft conversion (i.e., major modifications to systems); and {5) complete aircraft or propulsion systems overhaul and rebuilding (i.e., periodic restoration of aircraft to original design specifications). Sample analysis was completed for an investment in capital goods (machinery & equipment) used for the manufacture and repair of aircraft, NAICS sector 3364. Information Technology-- NAICS sector 51 {Information) comprises establishments engaged in the following processes: (a) producing and distributing information and cultural products, (b) providing the means to transmit or distribute these products as well as data or communications, and (c) processing data. The main components of this sector are the publishing industries, including software publishing, and both traditional publishing and publishing exclusively on the Internet; the motion picture and sound recording industries; the broadcasting industries, including traditional broadcasting and those broadcasting exclusively over the Internet; the telecommunications industries; Web search portals, data processing industries, and the information services industries. Sample analysis was completed for an investment in capital goods (machinery & equipment) used by a firm for management, scientific, and technical consulting services to design software. Biotechnology-- NAICS sector 5417 (Scientific Research and Development Services) comprises establishments primarily engaged in conducting biotechnology research and experimental development. Biotechnology research and experimental development involves the study of the use of microorganisms and cellular and biomolecular processes to develop or alter living or non-living materials. This research and development in biotechnology may result in development of new biotechnology processes or in prototypes of new or genetically-altered products that may be reproduced, utilized, or implemented by various industries. 4 Sample analysis was completed for an investment in capital goods (machinery & equipment) used for scientific research and development. Energy generation --NAICS sector 22 (Electric Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution) comprises establishments primarily engaged in operating electric power generation facilities. These facilities convert other forms of energy, such as water power (i.e., hydroelectric), fossil fuels, nuclear power, and solar power, into electrical energy. The establishments in this industry produce electric energy and provide electricity to transmission systems or to electric power distribution systems. Sample analysis was completed for an investment in capital goods (machinery & equipment) used for electric power generation transmission and distribution, NAICS sector 221. Real Estate Development-- NAICS sector 53 comprises establishments primarily engaged in renting, leasing, or otherwise allowing the use of tangible or intangible assets, and establishments providing related services. The major portion of this sector comprises establishments that rent, lease, or otherwise allow the use of their own assets by others. The assets may be tangible, as is the case of real estate and equipment, or intangible, as is the case with patents and trademarks. Sample analysis was completed for an investment in capital goods (machinery & equipment) used for retail operation of restaurants. 1-3 REGIONAL PROFILE 5 (b) (4) 7 (b) (4) 8 (b) (4) 9 (b) (4) 10 (b) (4) 11 (b) (4) 12 (b) (4) 13 (b) (4) 14 (b) (4) 15 (b) (4) 16 (b) (4) 17 (b) (4) 18 ........

In 1990, The United States Congress enacted an Immigration Act (the \"Act\"), which .created an employment-creation immigrant investor visa program to be administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") through its legacy agencies, the Bureau and Immigration Services and the lmrnigratiori and Naturalization Service. 2. The EB-5 permits tbrt:!ign nationals to receive conditional resident status in the United States in exchange tor making a capital investment in the United States that will benefit the United States economy. E(lch investment needs to create or save at least ten direct full-time jobs for U.S. workers. The minimum amount of investment is $1 ,000,000, but that minimum amount is reduced to $500,000 if the investment is made in a high unemployment area or qualirying rural region. 3. Jn 1992, the United States Congress enacted the EB-5 regional center pilot program. This Immigrant Investor Pilot Program (\"Program\") allows both public and private entities to apply for regional center status. The Program allows an investor to create or save at leHst ten direct and indirect full-time jobs for the U.S. workers. 4. The Foundation is a designated regional center pursuant to the Program, and was founded as a Nmth Dakota nonprofit corporation. The Foundation seeks to improve the regional workforce, work to advance job creation, to provide consultation services for foreign, iJwestors, and interact with entities assisting foreign investors to invest in Program eligible capital investments in the State ofNorth Dakota and Nortlnvcst Minnesota and serve as North Dakota and Northwest Mirmcsota's designated Regional Center as that tem1 is defined in the Program and pursuant to U~S. laws and regulations. 5. The Company is seeking equity investment (\"Investment\") aild is offering up to _(!llllount oftqtal moJlcy.l of (units _or sto~!~) in the Company for (Given ArnQuntL per (unit or share) pursuant to the Private Placement. Memorandum and in compliance with U.S. law and regulations, to foreign investors who (a) plan to file for an EB-5 Visa under the Immigrant 1nvestor Pilot Program (the \"Program\") through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USC IS\") and (b) are \"accredited investors\" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and where the \"accre~ited investor\" status does not violate U.S. laws and regulations. 6. The Investment by the EB5 investor will be equity capital at a minimum of US $1,000,000 unless the company is principally doing business in a targeted employment area in which case it may be as low as US $500,000. The investment capital provide by the EB5 investor is not a loan; the investor will not be entitled to any guaranteed returns but may share in distribuiions of profits; the investor will not have a redemption right or any right to force the buy-out of his share at a particular price; the investor will be engaged in management of the company in some capacity; and the company will provide evidence of job creation using the IMPLAN-based methodology that is provided by the Foundation. WHli;REfORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound by this Agreement, the Foundation and the Company mutually contract and agree as follows: I.

The primarily rmal areas ofNorthDakota and Northwest Minnesota would greatly benefit from foreign direct investment and the creation of new jobs. While we may have fared betterthan some over the past two years, our rural economy still faces unique economic challenges. Designating North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota as an \"EB-5 Regional Center\" under the immigration Investor Pilot Program is a great oppm1unity to foster growth and job creation in the seven industry sectors outlined in their application. It is imperative that our federal government and the private sector work together toward to foster job growth and capital investment to bring jobs to the unemployed and underemployed in regions likeN orth Dakcita\u00b7and Northwest Minnesota. The EB-5 Regional Center program is ideally suited and designed for rural regions like ours, and Foreign Direct Investment under the EB-5 program and the resulting increase in jobs would greatly benefit this region. The proposal submitted with their approach for a sustained effort is worthy offavorable consideration. Moreover, the UND Center for Innovation Foundation is uniquely qualified to be designated as a EB-5 Regional Center as one of the leading entrepreneur centers in the nation, recognized with eight national awards for excellence. It is just one of 19 incubator programs in the world that have been certified as a \"Soft Landiilgs Incubator,\" meaning the Center has the expertise to work internationally. The UND Center for Innovation Foundation has been working with innovators, entrepreneurs and angel investors in North Dakota Lmd Northwest Minnesota for 26 years, so they understand equity investment well and are well suited for this program. We fully supportUND Center for Innovation Foundation's efforts to establish an EB-5 Regional Center, and look forward to providing whatever assistance we can to make these efforts a reality.

On September 29, 2010, 2010 the USCIS issued Form I-797 Notice of Action requesting evidence in support of the Regional Center Proposal filed on April 22, 2 0 1 0. The USCIS noted the request did not contain sufficient evidence showing that the proposed regional center would meet the regulatory requirements as a Regional Center. Multiple issues were addressed in the request for evidence and the evidentiary requirements for each of these issues were explained in detail. However, the evidence provid:rl in response to the USCIS request did not establish eligibility under the Pilot Immigrant Investor Program . . , The University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center has requested '\\ designation as a Regional Center to be located within the entire state of North Dakota and 20 counties in Northwestern Minnesota, which includes Kittson, Roseau, Marshall, Pennington, Beltrami, Red Lake, PoL Norman, Clay, Otter Tail, Douglas, Pope, Traverse, Stevens, Wilkin, Becker, Mahnomen, Clearwater, Gra and Lake of the Woods. Capital investment will be used to invest in several target industries: agribusines advanced manufacturing, aviation/ aerospace, information technologies/ communications, construction a real estate development (rural/urban renewal/multi-mixed use), biotech/bioscience, and utilities (elecn power generation). The Regional or National Impact of the Regional Center Under 8 CFR \u00a7 204.6(m) (3) (iv), a regional center proposal must contain a prediction regarding the manner in which the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy in general as reflected by such factors as increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and outside of the regional center. This requirement means that the proposal must analyze the impact of regional center activities. Alth<:mgh a business plan was submitted for the regional center, the proposal did not include a prediction regarding the manner in which the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy in general as reflected by such factors as increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and outside of the regional center. The business plan did not address specific factors like increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair and construction both within and outside of the regional center but rather overall impact of output, employment and household earnings by each sector such as agribusiness, advanced manufacturing, aviation/aerospace, information technologies/ communications, biotech/bioscience,, construction and real estate development (rural/urban renewal/multi-mixed use), and utilities (electric power generation). Therefore, the regional or national impact of the regional center has not been demonstrated. ATTACHMENT l-!7! 't RCW1 031910017 /W0900 1760/University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Foundation RC Page 3 Job Creation Section 610(a) ofP.L. 102-395 as amended by P.L. 107-273 describes the statutory basis for eligibility as a Regional Center a) Of the visas otherwise available under section 203(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U .S.C. 1 15 3 (b) ( 5)), the Secretary of State, together with the Attorney General, shall set aside visas for a pilot program to implement the provisions of such section .... The establishment of a regional center may be based on general predictions\u00b7, contained in the proposal, concerning the kinds of commercial enterprises that will receive capital from aliens, the jobs that will be created directly or indirectly as a result of such capital investments and the other positive economic effects such capital investments will have ... Moreover, 8 C.F.R. 204.6(e) states in pertinent part: Commercial enterprise means any for-profit activity formed for the ongoing conduct of lawful business including, but not limited to, a sole proprietorship, partnership (whether limited or general), holding company, joint venture, corporation, business trust, or other entity which may be publicly or privately owned. This definition includes a commercial enterprise consisting of a holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, provided that each such subsidiary is engaged in a for-profit activity formed for the ongoing conduct of a lawful business. This definition shall not include a non-commercial activity such as owning and operating a personal residence. A regional center proposal must be supported by economically or statistically valid forecasting tools, including, but not limited to, feasibility studies, analyses of foreign and domestic markets for the goods or services to be exported, and job creation multipliers related both geographically and by job type. This requirement that a proposal include the valid multipliers applicable to an identified economic activity and job type is in accordance with the regulatory requirements, in particular, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.6(m)(3)(ii). Whether a proposed regional center will foster sufficient job-creation and economic benefits to justify the regional center designation is an issue to be determined by users during the course of evaluating regional center proposals. Regional center proposals should include evidence of the proposed regional center's evaluative economic models, feasibility studies regarding projects and investments that are to take place within the geographic area of the proposed regional center, as well as statements and attestations from interested and supportive public agencies and private organizations located within the area of the regional center. In the instant proposal, University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Renovation Foundation Regional Center will use capital investment to invest in several target industries: agribusiness, advanced manufacturing, aviation/ aerospace, information technologies/ communications, biotech/bioscience,, construction and real estate development (rural/urban renewal/multi-mixed use), and utilities (electric power generation). ATTACHMENT 1-171 -l RCW1 031910017 /W09001760/University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Foundation RC Page 4 Although the proposal included a Business Plan and a revised Economic Analysis (see Revised IMPLAN Proposal), the proposal did not show how EB-5 investor funds will be capitalized in a manner that will create at least 10 full-time jobs per EB-5 investor. The proposal identified seven industry clusters for job creation but did not identify the projects and investments for which EB-5 investor funds will be used, Without knowing the projects and investments in the regional center, users cannot make a determination as to whether investment capital will be utilized in a manner that will create the requisite jobs. In tandem with the identification of the investments and projects, the proposal does not contain any evaluative economic models and feasibility studies regarding the projects and investments that are to take place within the designated geographic area of the proposed regional center_ The Economic Analysis that was submitted with the proposal appears to be generic in nature and focuses simply on the job creation impacts for the industry clusters rather than the job creation impacts for the industry clusters in a project or investment based on a $1,000,000 capital investment. Such evidence would not only meet a basic requirement for a regional center, but also would be useful in establishing that the capital investments proposed are compatible with community plans and goals for economic development in the area. r Further, the proposal does not show how the capital funds will flow from the investor (both EB-5 and non EB-5) to the job-creating entity. . users cannot determine whether investment capital will actually flow from the investor to the job-creating enterprise. Moreover, the proposal does not show how the jobs will be created even though the Economic Analysis projects that at least ten ( 1 0) (direct and/ or indirect) full-time jobs will be created in each industry cluster based on the expenditure of a $1,000,000 capital investment (see Pages 2 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10 of the Revised IMPLAN Proposal)'. The proposal further states that capital funds will be used for manufacturing but the proposal is not clear as to what this means (see Pages 2 3, 5, 6, 7 and 1 0 of the Revised IMPLAN Proposal). Without knowing the job-creating activities that the regional center will be engaged in, USCIS cannot determine whether investment capital will be utilized in a manner that will create the requisite jobs. Therefore, without knowing the kinds of investment projects, the flow of capital, or how the jobs will be ! created, users cannot determine whether the investment capital will be utilized in a manner that will create the requisite jobs. In light of these facts, the proposal fails to show that the investment vehicles to be undertaken by University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Renovation Foundation Regional Center can reasonably be expected to provide the requisite permanent, full-time job-creation and create positive economic impact from EB-5 alien investors. ATTACHMENT 1-171 (b) (4)I RCW1 031910017 /W09001760/University of North Dakota Center for Innovation Foundation RC Page 5 Administrative Oversight The law and regulations at 8 CFR 204.6(m)(6), require that an approved Regional Center must continue to meet the statutory requirements of the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program by serving the purpose of promoting economic growth, including increased export sales (where applicable), improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment in order to maintain the validity of its approval and designation. To maintain its validity of its approval and designation, the region center must oversee its administration, oversight, and management by monitoring all investment activities under its sponsorship, and maintaining records, data and information on a quarterly basis in order to report to users upon request so that users can determine whether an approved and designated Regional Center is in compliance with 8 CFR 2 04.6 ( m) ( 6), and continues to operate as a USCIS approved and designated Regional Center. The proposal does not contain any documentation that permits the users to conclude that proposed regional center, if approved and designated, will be in compliance with 8 CFR 204.6(m) ( 6), and will continue to operate as a USCIS approved and designated Regional Center. Thus, in tenns administrative oversight, the proposal is deficient because it did not include the following: a description of how the regional center plans to administer, oversee, and manage itself, including but not limited to such things as identifying, assessing and evaluating proposed immigrant investor projects and enterprises; whether the investment capital to be sought will consist solely of alien investor capital or a combination of alien investor capital and domestic capital; how all affiliated investment activities will be monitored, through or under the sponsorship of the proposed Regional Center, and how the regional center will maintain records, data and information on projects, investors, business activities, etc., in order to report to USCIS for each Federal Fiscal Year . Overall, it has not demonstrated that the regional center will conduct adequate and sufficient administrative oversight for the users to conclude that proposed regional center, if approved and designated, will be in compliance with 8 CFR 204.6(m)(6), and will continue to operate as a USerS approved and designated Regional Center. In summary, it has not been shown that permanent full-time jobs will be created using a statistically valid econometric model; that regional or national impact of regional center will be realized and that regional center will be able to conduct adequate and sufficient administrative oversight in order to maintain the validity of its approval and designation. For these reasons, this Regional Center Proposal is denied.

However, approval of a petition does not give any status or right. Actual status is given when the beneficiary is given the proper visa and uses it to enter the United States. Please contact the appropriate U.S. consulate directly if you have any questions about visa issuance. For nonimmigrant petitions, the beneficiary should contact the consulate after receiving our approval notice. For approved immigrant petitions, the beneficiary should wait to be contacted by consulate. If the beneficiary is now in the United States and believes he or she may be eligible for the new status without going abroad for a visa, he or she should use InfoPass to contact a local USCIS office about applying here. G:D' U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE: 2008-351-113 Denials. A denial means that after every consideration, USCIS concluded that the evidence submitted did not establish eligibility for the requested benefit. If you believe there is more evidence that will establish eligibility, you can file a new application or petition, or you can file a motion to reopen this case. If you believe the denial is inconsistent with precedent decisions or regulations, you can file a motion for reconsideration. If the front of this notice states that this denial can be appealed and you believe the decision is in error, you can file an \u00b7appeal. You can obtain more information about these processes by either using InfoPass to contact your local USCIS office, or by calling the National Customer Service Center. Form I-797E (Rev. 05/05/06) Page 2 INTRODUCTION The ND/NW- MN EB-5 RC will be located at the Ina Mae Rude Entrepreneur Center, owned and managed by the UNO Center for Innovation Foundation. The Foundation is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit that supports the UNO Center for Innovation. The Center for Innovation is a department of the University of North Dakota with mission and goals of fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment. The specific geographic area for this Regional Center includes the entire state of North Dakota and 20 counties in Northwest Minnesota, more specifically Kittson, Roseau, Marshall, Pennington, Beltrami, Red Lake, Polk, Norman, Clay, Otter Tail, Douglas, Pope, Traverse, Stevens, Wilkin, Becker, Mahnomen, Clearwater, Grarit, and Lake of the Woods counties. Those specific counties in Minnesota are included because they share similar demographics, industries and economies with the state of North Dakota. Those areas in North Dakota and the northwest part of Minnesota are, for the most part, considered targeted employment areas (TEA) by the Federal Government. This designation lowers the minimum amount that must be invested by foreign investors. Normally the minimum amount of investment is US$1 ,000,000, but if investments are in a TEA the minimum investment is US$ 500,000. North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota have a multitude of areas that classify as TEAs. With that in mind, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to attract a larger volume of investments in the half million dollar bracket but it is also prepared to receive $1 ,000,000 investments. The principal identities in this project have worked together closely on entrepreneurial, international, and financial projects. They are Bruce Gjovig -CEO of CIF and Director of the Center for Innovation, Rodrigo Cintra --International Marketing Director/ Entrepreneur Consultant, and Tom Kenville- Rainmaker and V.P. \u00b7Of Development. Additional information about the principals is found in the \"Principals of Regional Center'' section of this application as well as in Appendix A. Moreover, these contacts will be responsible for promoting, processing and managing EB-5 international investments attracted by the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. In addition, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will coordinate with multiple private and public entities in the states of North Dakota and Minnesota such as the government of North Dakota, the North Dakota Trade Office (NDTO), North Dakota Department of Commerce (NDDOC), Minnesota Economic Improvement Commission, and others. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to focus on the following specific seven industries: Agribusiness Advanced Manufacturing Aviation/ Aerospace Information Technologies/ Communications Biotech I Bioscience Construction and Real Estate Development: Rural/Urban Renewal/ Multi-Mixed Use. Utilities (Electric Power Generation) These industries were chosen to complement the available resources and growth in the region. The region's resources include abundant agricultural land, a highly productive labor force, and an expanding infrastructure. While the US economy has suffered during the recent recession, North Dakota's Gross Domestic Product grew at 7.3% in 2008, which was the highest among all states according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Adding to this economic strength is an unemployment rate of 3.7% in August of 2010, which is the lowest in the nation, and a state budget surplus projected to be nearly a billion dollars. North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota are leaders in the nation in agribusiness production as top producers of 14 major crops and are primary innovators in the development of agribusiness related renewable energies, including wind, value added identity preserved foods, and agribusiness related biotech vaccines/medical remedies. 4. Additionally, these industries were chosen because of their: 1. Consistency with strategic economic development goals in both states; 2.University graduate program strengths/incubator possibilities to develop new businesses with ties to our research and technology parks and center(s) for innovation relating to electrical engineering, polymers and coatings, and renewable energy development from crops. 3. Construction and real estate development is primarily focused on renewing rural downtown areas and developing other projects situated in rural oil producing areas. Highly successful programs have been developed turning downtowns into professional services, entertainment, and chic boutique areas along with urban apartments. Of these, we believe there are many potential projects that could be generated per year in communities in the region. Some will be at post-angel stage, some in mature industries looking to expand into new international markets requiring angel or loan funding. The plan is to augment EB-5 funding with other equity funds through side-by-side investments with each project evaluated accordingly. UNO CENTER FOR INNOVATION FOUNDATION GOALS The purpose of establishing the UND Center for Innovation Foundation as a USC IS EB-5 Regional Center is strictly related to: Attract foreign direct investment into the state of North Dakota and into Northwest Minnesota in order to generate economic development, create new jobs and increase domestic capital investment. Currently we are working with Brazilian, South Korean, Chinese, Canadian and other investment groups to establish a model to bring investment, create jobs, and employ students to North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota. Create partnerships between American private investors and international investors (side-by -side investments) in order to give credibility to all investment deals proposed by the North Dakota/ Nof\\!hwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Center as well as to attract new potential investors. Interested parties include: HK Investors group, RAIN Funds, Bison Ventures, and North Dakota Development Fund. Other funding entities are being identified and will be included in the project in the future. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will work as a source of creation for direct and indirect jobs for EB-5 immigrant investment projects. The IMP LAN model will be utilized in order to evaluate Regional Center direct and indirect job creation. This part of the project will be administered with the assistance of the University of North Dakota talent, more specifically, the UND economics department. Prospective domestic venture participants will be identified through access to ND Trade Office client base, RAIN investor base, Center for Innovation client base, and economic development groups across state. Provide a vehicle for investing in expanding companies with export potential to allow immigrant investors eligibility under the USC IS Regional Center Pilot Program. Companies will be selected for the Regional Center Program based on (i) job creation potential and (ii) the signing of a contract by the company ensuring compliance with the EB-5 program; and; Secure administration fees by working with international investors and local businesses interested in the EB-5 Immigration Visa Program. Administration fees will cover services provided by the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC related to deal overview, deal referrals, tracking documentation, and compiling and providing any necessary reporting documentation to USCIS. Moreover, investments will be organized on a side-by-side basis where both foreign investors and American investors will be able to jointly invest in determined projects. This side-by\u00ad side element will be in place to give foreign investors a sense of security and legitimacy related to investment projects promoted by the North Dakota/ Northwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Center. This also provides leverage to American investors. In addition, expanding companies can highly 5 benefit from new funding alternatives. This new regional center will aim at generating economic development activity, creating new direct and indirect jobs, and increasing domestic capital for investment. The center will take advantage of its connections with the Rain Source Capital Funds in order to identify and screen potential companies and generate deal flow. Currently there are 10 angel investment funds in North Dakota and Minnesota which have been formed and are administered with the assistance of the UNO Center for Innovation. The center has close ties to the others. They are located in Fargo, Grand Forks, Bismarck, and Wahpeton, ND and Fosston, MN. They will serve as a checkpoint to pre-screen deals and perform due diligence. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to generate deal flow through these Angel Funds. We expect that up to 10 potential side-by-side investment deals will be generated each year. GEOGRAPHIC REGION The North Dakota/Northwest Minnesota Regional Center geographic area will include the entire state of North Dakota and 20 counties in northwest Minnesota. The state of North Dakota and 20 northwest Minnesota counties are very similar in terms of industry and demographics. Although it is a large geographic area to cover, both areas combined have a population of only 1 ,005,000 people. (North Dakota with a total population of 641,481 and Northwest Minnesota with 363,594). It is important for the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC to incorporate this entire region as it will facilitate the process of identifying and developing potential leads. Below are three maps that illustrate the region that this Regional Center will serve: 6 North Dakota- Northwest Minnesota Region: The region select is mainly rural and most of the area is TEA Below is a map showing all 53 counties in the state of North Dakota that are included in our application: Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 The entire state of North Dakota plus Northwest Minnesota was selected as the Regional Center's area after determining the number of investment opportunities that are found within this geographic location.

More information about the North Dakota geographic region and economy is found in the \"Industry Focus\" section. Moreover, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC includes 20 counties in Northwest Minnesota. The reason behind this decision is because both regions are tied economically, have similar industries, and economies sharing the same trade area. The map below gives a broad view of the area where Kittson, Roseau, Marshall, Pennington, Beltrami, Red Lake, Polk, Norman, Clay, Otter Tail, Douglas, Pope, Traverse, Stevens, Wilkin, Becker, Mahnomen, Clearwater, Grant, and Lake of the Woods counties are located.

This is the complete region that the ND-NW MN EB-5 RC will cover. -- EMMONS MdNTOSH UNO CENTER FOR INNOVATION UNO CENTER FOR INNOVATION The ND/NW- MN EB-5 RC will be located at the Ina Mae Rude Entrepreneur Center which is owned and managed by the UND Center for Innovation Foundation (UND CIF). The Foundation is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit that supports the UND Center for Innovation which is a department of the University of North Dakota with mission and goals of innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment. UND Center for Innovation Foundation articles of organization and bylaws, are included in Appendix A, providing further evidence that the UND CIF qualifies as an economic entity. The UND Center for Innovation at the University of North Dakota mentors, advises, and consults with innovators, entrepreneurs, students and researchers to launch new ventures, commercialize new technologies and secure access to capital from private and public sources. It was among the first entrepreneur outreach centers in the nation when formed in 1984. 26 years later, the UND Center for Innovation operates two incubator facilities in the UND Tech Park: the Norm Skalicky Tech Incubator and the Ina Mae Rude Entrepreneur Center. These incubators are seedbeds that help emerging entrepreneurs grow new ventures and viable businesses. UND Center for Innovation staff is under contract with the UND CIF to perform services related to the operations of the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. Moreover, the UND Center for Innovation has been working with international clients since 1992, working to bring foreign-based technology ventures into the U.S. market by developing export entry plans, conducting market research, locating distribution, manufacturing, development partners and providing a reputable foreign base of operations. All these services are still being provided by the center. In 2006 the center was designated a Soft Landing International Incubator, one of only 19 in the world by the National Business Incubator Association (NBIA). The center received this recognition because it has proven itself as a business incubator that helps companies expand 9 internationally. The UNO Center for Innovation has recently expand its Soft Landing International Incubator designation until 2012. The UNO Center for Innovation has assisted with the launch of more than 460 products and businesses since 1984 and has won national, regional and state awards including: The national Tibbetts Award in 1996 and 1998 in recognition of contributions to the SBIR program and technology innovation; the national Small Business Administration's (SBA) Vision 2000 Award in 1999 for tech entrepreneurship; The Region VII (a six-state region) SBA Small Business Research Advocate Award in 2003; the state chamber of commerce's Entrepreneurial Spirit award in 2003; and the state Governor's Choice Innovator of the Year Award in 2009. The center was a finalist for two national awards in 2009 as well, named 151 runner-up for the Incubator Innovation Award by the National Business Incubation Association and named a finalist for the Excellence in Rural Economic Development award by the US Economic Development Administration. In addition, the center's programs have been instrumental in UNO's ranking in the top 1% of collegiate entrepreneurship programs nationwide four years in a row by Princeton Review and Entrepreneur Magazine. The Center's Brochures and other marketing material are included in Appendix F. SOURCE/ AMOUNT OF CAPITAL REGIONAL CENTER The UNO Center for Innovation Foundation has initially allocated for the regional center application development phase. Most of the funds will be utilized to cover any legal fees plus analysis related to the application process. Also, one supporter of the regional center, the North Dakota Department of Commerce, has invested which will be used for marketing and startup purposes. The Foundation will provide additional funds for startup, operations, and will cover staff costs. The Center for Innovation Foundation resolution authorizing application for an EB- 5 Regional Center for North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota is found in Appendix E. The Center believes that this initial investment will be sufficient throughout the application process as most of this application has been compiled by Center for Innovation Foundation staff. Over 300 hours of staff time and multiple Center for Innovation resources have been utilized in order to complete this application. Additionally the center has received a Technology Based Entrepreneur Grant (TBEG) from the North Dakota Department of Commerce to help support international operations. After designation is received, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to sustain its operation by collecting administration fees in order to have cash flow and to augment the Regional Center's budget structure. This operational structure will secure the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC's financial sustainability. Moreover, the UNO Center for Innovation Foundation will be responsible for identifying and raising any additional capital as required. INDUSTRY FOCUS: AN ECONOMIC PICTURE OF NORTH DAKOTA AND PART OF NORTHWEST MINNESOTA Over the past quarter of a century, North Dakota's population has reflected both the level of technology in agriculture and the demand for energy and energy technology. In 2008, the population was nearly 639,000. In 2000 it was move, just over 642,000. Even within that nine year period the level of population varied as significant decreases in population occurred when new, larger farm machinery appeared. However, within that same time the demand for energy increased rapidly and what may be the largest reserve of oil ever discovered in North America was found within the state (the Bakken Formation), making North Dakota the 4th largest oil producing state in America. These changes in oil recovery attracted an increase in population somewhat offsetting the decrease caused by new agricultural technologies. 10 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) Initially because of its coal reserves, energy has played an important economic role in North Dakota while it has been virtually non-existent in Minnesota. Now with increased interest in the development of alternative energy such as biofuels, geothermal, and wind energy; energy may become more significant to the twenty county region of northwest Minnesota. Those new technologies also apply to North Dakota, especially wind and geothermal energy. In 2006 North Dakota produced 724 trillion Btus of energy, or one percent of the total production in the U.S. Because of the large production of power in the state the price paid for electricity in North Dakota in 2006 was among the lowest in the nation. In fact, electricity is twice as expensive in New England, California. North Dakota's future in energy will only become more important as time passes. As the result of favorable wind tests that have been completed by the government, North Dakota has been called the Saudi Arabia of wind. That is because the wind blows more consistently at a rapid enough speed to produce more electricity than any other place in the nation. The Bakken formation alone may be the largest quantity of oil ever discovered in North America and the Sanish formation lying underneath, while too early to be certain, may be even larger. Also, for more than a decade, the political leaders in North Dakota have made a very specific effort to make the state more like the rest of the nation in terms of expanding the manufacturing base and in a related effort in keeping and attracting young people to the state. The program has had mixed success. The state was successful in expanding manufacturing, particularly in agriculture and energy. The state also became the location of a major facility for the largest manufacturer of private airplanes and a manufacturer of blades for a major worldwide wind generation company. As with most manufacturers, the recent economic difficulties have had an adverse effect on manufacturing in the state. However, the most recent data appears to indicate that these firms are recovering rapidly from those economic setbacks. North Dakota is a homogeneous area, both in the makeup of its economy and its population. Although significant changes have occurred in the past decade, it is accurate to describe North Dakota as dominated by Caucasians. Native Americans are the only minority population of any significance, and even they represent a relatively small percent of the total (5%). On the other hand, when it comes to factors such as education, and women-owned businesses, North Dakota is much like the balance of the United States. In fact, women especially have always played an important role in the states business community. Manufacturing tends to be dominated by agricultural firms with both Case IH and John Deere having major manufacturing plants in the state. However, North Dakota is also home to one of Microsoft's and Amazon's major campuses. One additional modern and futuristic industry in which North Dakota is becoming a major player in is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or UAVs. In the last round of the Base Realignment and Closing (BRAC) the Grand Forks Air Force Base was downsized but designated one of the United States Air Force's UAV bases. Already stationed at the base are first generations UAVs and second generation UAVs are scheduled to arrive very soon. In addition, the plans call for the assignment of Air Force personnel in support of the UAV mission. It is expected that because of the UAV experimentation many private UAV manufacturing personnel will also be stationed at the Air Force Base. Related to, but independent from the base designation is the UAV Center of Excellence program at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. The University of North Dakota's aviation program has been listed one of the outstanding post secondary aviation programs in the US. The Center of Excellence designation by the office of the Governor of North Dakota makes the program responsible for a large role in America's UAV future. North Dakota has also played an important role in the emerging biotechnology discipline and its developing industries. This is particularly true in the area of agriculture and the health sciences. Its emerging role in agriculture biotechnology is based on its natural agricultural base. Not only is the Upper Midwest an important growing area for small grains, it also area where many high value specialty crops such as potatoes, sugar beets, pulse crops like peas, sunflowers and edible beans, and many other crops are grown. 11 Taken together, these specialty crops have allowed science to stave off worldwide food shortages. These scientific advances usually take place where the crops are grown, and in these cases that means North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. The personal health advances in biotechnology can occur in many geographic areas as long as an area has demonstrated a desire to do so. That desire has existed here for a long time. Studies have shown that when European settlers first arrived on the Great Plains they knew that they had to make life work for them. That tradition has carried down through the four and more generations since the arrival of those pioneers. That attitude has attracted others here because they know that the population of this area is willing to \"do what it takes\" to make a project succeed. That attitude has manifested itself in the public sector as well in the amount and type of research being conducted both at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and at North Dakota State University, particularly in the School of Pharmacy. In the private sector the most significant research and commercialization that occurred within Pracs Institute which was headquartered in Fargo, North Dakota, and had a second research facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. They recently sold to Cetero Research, which headquarters are located in Cary, NC. Other biotechnology firms have also been established across North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, especially over the past decade. As with the agricultural biotechnology, human health biotechnology, its research and successful commercialization is a stated goal of the university system. This has created a culture of research aimed at reaching that goal. As with other business ideas in the Great Plains, the biggest obstacle has been a lack of capital. Located on the Canadian border, North Dakota also plays a major role in both Canadian agriculture and Canadian energy. North Dakota is the entry point for Canadian tar sands oil and commercial fertilizers, as well as hydroelectric power. Because of the large manufacturing base located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and in other areas of the prairie provinces, and the two way transportation flow of finished goods, eastern North Dakota is called the Red River Trade Corridor. This is an historic trade route dating back initially to trade among the Native American tribes as well as\u00b7the fur trade between Europeans and Native Americans from Winnipeg through St. Paul, Minnesota. The only significant change in the region's economics over the past decade occurred as in the same categories as in the rest of the nation, income levels and housing values. The income levels are a reflection mostly of inflation as income has increased to reflect the devaluing of the dollar. However, over this period North Dakota has had some real growth in income and that also has contributed to the increase in the average salaries earned. As for housing values, especially over the particular time period, North Dakota did not participate in the changes in mortgage standards as did most of the nation. Most mortgages were based on an ability to pay and as a result proportionately very few expensive homes were built. That means that while values did increase to reflect both inflation and increases in real income the increases were considerably less than what occurred across the nation. Most data listed for North Dakota is not available for the twenty county region in Minnesota covered in this application for regional center status. It is accurate to state that this region is regarded as essentially being similar to North Dakota. In fact, any research that has been completed demonstrates that most data from that twenty county Minnesota region is more similar to North Dakota than it is to even the average of the rest of the state of Minnesota, and certainly to several of the other regions of Minnesota. In particular this is true of comparing this twenty county region to what is regarded as the seven county metropolitan region surrounding Minneapolis and St. Paul. Because of the significant difference in the major crops and livestock,' the twenty county region is also very different than the agricultural areas in the southern one third to one half of Minnesota. It is only at the southern tip of the twenty county region that livestock has any real economic significance. The same is true for the higher valued corn and soybean row crops. There 12 are some areas that would be different because of differences in geography. For example, much of the Minnesota region is in the heart of the lake country. Therefore, we would expect to find tourism more important in that region than in all of North Dakota. Finally, North Dakota currently has the lowest unemployment rate in the nation. That does not mean that the state is necessarily expanding on an economic basis. Rather, it is again the nature of the lessons learned by that homogeneous population that you must travel where the jobs are. Most of our high school and college graduates (two out of three) leave the state to find a job. Therefore, they are not unemployed. On the other hand, whenever the state has expanded its job base, regardless of the level of skills required, employers have always been able to fill the jobs, usually by native sons and daughters returning to the state. Native sons and daughters' preferences are to return home. The only thing keeping them from doing so is the lack of available jobs. When the jobs arrive so will they. Under-employment is pervasive as many are working below their educational and experience level, waiting for new jobs to be created that better fit their abilities.

This separate document was created to showcase the economic impact generated by foreign direct investment in North Dakota and 20 counties in Northwest Minnesota. It also emphasizes the job creation component of the EB- 5 initiative which is crucial for the immigration process. 1M PLAN was selected because it is approved by the USCIS. \u00b7 'Information for the 20 northwestern Minnesota counties in this study is unavailable. Therefore, because Minnesota has little variation this information is provided using the whole state data. 13 Full economic impact assessments will be provided to each individual project promoted by ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. These reports will be conducted by the University of North Dakota and supervised by Cullen Goenner, Associate Professor of Economics at University of North Dakota, and Ralph Kingsbury, a contracted professional economist. IMPLAN is a widely used input-output model and is commonly used in inter-agency analysis worldwide. TARGET EMPLOYMENT AREAS (TEA) REPORTING The UNO Center for Innovation Foundation and the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will work in conjunction with the North Dakota and Minnesota Department of Commerce as well as the North Dakota and Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development in order to provide the necessary documentation to classify specific locations as Target Employment Areas (TEA's) within the Regional Center proposed geographic location. TEAs will be defined according to the USC IS definition. All projects promoted by the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC that are located in a TEA will be supported by the necessary documentation supporting such designation. Sample reports of TEA's from both the North Dakota and Minnesota Government Offices are found in Appendix G. ND/NW MN EB-5 RC OPERATIONAL PLAN AND ADMINSTRATIVE OVERSIGHT The UNO Center for Innovation will be responsible for the day to day operations of the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. The center will be responsible for selecting and screening commercial enterprises interested in participating in this program as well as attracting and screening accredited immigrant investors. The following sections of this business plan describe how the ND/NW-MN EB- 5 RC through the UNO Center for Innovation plans to accomplish such tasks. PRINCIPALS OF REGIONAL CENTER The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC has defined the principal members who will be responsible for deal sourcing, operations, promotion, marketing, and reporting obligations.

ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC PROMOTION /MARKETING STRATEGY The UNO Center for Innovation Foundation has developed a marketing strategy to promote and expose the new North Dakota/Northwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Center. This marking strategy plan will be used to attract foreign direct investors as well as deal flow: PROMOTION STRATEGY- ATTRACTING AND SCREEING IMMIGRANT INVESTORS a. Design a ND/NW-MN EB-5 website affiliated with the Center for Innovation Foundation. The address for the website is www.ndeb5.com. This new website will introduce our region, industries and characteristics, and bridge regional center to investors and recruiting deal flow. The web-site will have multi-language capabilities in English, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, and South Korean. The website has been developed and will be deployed once the UNO Center for Innovation Foundation receives the designation to operate the ND/NW\u00ad EB-5 RC. The website is similar to other EB-5 Regional Centers' websites and will provide information such as : i. Organization structure and background ii. Why EB-5 is attractive to foreign investors iii. What is a regional center iv. Why should investors invest in our region ( North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota) \" v. Investment review vi. Proposed Projects and their summaries vii. Contact information of all the parties involved viii. Links to other organizations involved including USCIS, law firms, government entities, and regional organizations ix. Provide access to all Immigration forms related to EB-5 investments b. 15 (b) (4)c. d. e. f. g. Foreign Agents: SCREENING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTORS Immigrant investors applying for US lawful permanent residence through the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will have to demonstrate that they are admissible to the U.S. Section 12 of the Immigration and Nationality Act sets forth various grounds of inadmissibility, which may prevent an otherwise eligible investor from receiving a lawful permanent residence or be admitted to the U. S. A complete list of immigrant investors who are ineligible to receive conditional lawful permanent \u00b7 residence or be admitted to the US is found on Appendix I. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will not accept any immigrant investor who fails to comply with this initial screening process. 16 (b) (4) (b) (4) DOCUMENTING LAWFUL SOURCE OF INVESTMENT FUNDS All immigrant investors interested in acquiring permanent residence through the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will have to prove that (1) the source of the invested capital is lawful and (2) that the immigrant investor has a \"level of income\" or has accumulated sufficient wealth that would enable the investor to invest, i.e. accredited investor. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will not accept self serving declarations to satisfy requirements for proof of either lawful source of funds of sufficient funds to invest. All claims to the source of funds will have to be properly and thoroughly supported with documentary evidence of how the money was earned. The following types of documentary evidence will be accepted by the ND/NW\u00ad MN EB-5 RC to prove the funding sources are lawful: Financial Documents Complete tax returns (both individual and, if applicable, corporate or partnership tax returns) filed in the home jurisdiction for each of the last five years.

As an example, the Center for Innovation alone sees more than 100 business plans a year, of which many could potentially qualify for this program. The applicant is confident in the proposed Center's ability to generate deal flow. ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC PARTNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS In order to support the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC operations the UND Center for Innovation staff has begun developing relationships with potential service providers, more specifically Immigration law firms. Teras Immigration Law Firm, located in Washington DC became a supporter and potentially a partner of this initiative. This Immigration law firm has previous experience with EB-5 investments and process. Besides providing VISA and other legal services to foreign investors, such as walking them through the Green Card application process, they will also help the center to promote and market the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC.

Projects that fail to provide a clear exit strategy and promote the necessary job creation during a specific project will not qualify as potential candidates for EB-5 investment. In addition, the center will require that all projects define a clear exit strategy for immigrant investors, even though the exit strategy will not be guaranteed by the Regional Center as well as the commercial enterprise. Funds will be completely at risk. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will analyze projects on a case-by-case basis to determine their level of development, sophistication, and completeness A sample of a due diligence checklist that will be used by the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC to screen potential projects can be found on Appendix H. PROPOSED INVESTMENT STRUCTURE The UND Center for Innovation Foundation is prepared to apply for a Regional Center designation status. This program will have a significant economic and social impact in the region. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to present a business structure that is slightly different than those presented by other Regional Centers currently in operation. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to act as a consulting vehicle, working as a liaison between local organizations interested in accessing EB-5 capital and foreign investors. The UND Center for Innovation Foundation will have control over administration of the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC and will require investee companies to execute a contract providing for EB-5 program compliance. Once designated a Regional Center, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will have no ownership on deals promoted for investment. However, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will actively encourage communication and facilitation between the parties to ensure information is properly disseminated and all EB-5 investment requirements are fulfilled. Administration fees will be charged to both foreign investors and regional business organizations (investees) to help offset operational costs incurred by staff and advisors during investment projects. These fees will cover items such as document preparation, legal expenses 21 associated with managing investments, marketing expenses, traveling, finder fees, operating expenses and the like. These administrative fees will not reduce the threshold minimum capital ($500,000 or $1 million) required for EB-5 eligibility. Regular documentation and reports will also be professionally compiled and disseminated to all parties involved in specific projects in order to ensure all requirements of an investment, both legal and financial, are being covered. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC, as a consultancy entity, will strive to ensure all information provided to its clients is professional and of high quality and will be responsible for reporting annually to USC IS on Regional Center activities. Fee Structure for Foreign Investors: The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will provide consultancy services to immigrant investors interested and able to participate in EB-5 projects promoted by this Regional Center. Once approved through the screening due diligence process foreign direct Investors will engage the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC for the purpose of: providing consultancy services related to participation in the EB-5 investment based immigration program. identifying qualified EB-5 investment opportunities and making introductions for potential investment; identifying and recommending professional service providers necessary for completion of EB-5 investment. Immigrant investors will be charged a project administration fee of $25,000 independent of the size and location of a specific project ($1 ,000,000 or $500,000). This is a flat fee per investment share. This fee will be paid to the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC once the investor engages in services with the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. A deal source non-refundable fee of 20% of the project administration fee will be retained in case the investors withdraw from a specific project without any reason or cause or the 1-526 petition is denied. This fee will be collected to determine immigrant investors' seriousness. The total administration fee will be collected as soon as the immigrant investors engage in services with the ND/NW-EB-5 RC. A contract for services will be provided to immigrant investors delineating the obligations of the Regional Center as well as immigrant investors. Once immigrant investors sign this contract they are officially engaging in services with the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. A sample of the contract for services for immigrant investors can be found on Appendix C. The case below gives a hypothetical example of what an investment promoted by the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC would look like in terms of time frame, structure, and fees: Example -Minimum investment required in this project is US$ 1 ,000,000. With each Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), 10 new direct and indirect jobs will be created. Direct and indirect jobs will be measured by IMPLAN results. The total size of the project is , plus American investors. This combination of EB-5 and domestic funds will help meet the job creation requirement. There are available for foreign direct investment. Fees involved in the project per investment: Investment per unit: US$1 ,000,000 Project administration fees: U per investment, independent of size and location. These fees will be used to partly cover operations costs incurred by the Regional Center as well as to cover \"finder's fees\" paid to individuals or groups bringing investors to the regional center. These 22 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4)) fees are paid in addition to the EB-5 minimum capital required. They will be collected at the beginning of a specific project by wire transfer. Extra Attorney fees: Clients will also be advised and responsible for the extra legal/ immigration fees that will be incurred in the investment process. These fees can vary from US$ 10,000 to US$15,000 depending on the immigration law firm used in specific cases. The ND/NW\u00ad MN EB-5 RC will refer its clients to immigration legal firms that have a positive track record. It will be up to the investor and the referred immigration law firm to determine the final legal costs involved with the immigration process. Other legal fees related to structuring the investment deal, international accounting, international taxing structure, and others may also apply. Immigrant investors may also utilize their own legal support in a specific project. They are fully responsible for the outcome on their application process. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 will not advice or provide services to immigrant investors related to the \"Green Card\" application process. Deal Sourcing Non-Refundable Fee: of the project administration fees are non-refundable -This fee will be collected to determine if potential foreign investors are serious. As previously mentioned the total administration fees will be collected once immigrant investors engage in services with the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. e.g. contract for services is signed. Total cost of Investment per Unit: Below a hypothetical investor time line is provided. These guidelines will be provided to immigrant investors to give direction related to our specific projects. Variations may occur depending on specific circumstances of each individual project and size of the projects. Investor Time Line (Hypothetical): 23 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4)Fee Structure for Commercial Enterprises: The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will also provide consultancy services to local commercial enterprises interested and able to participate in EB-5 projects promoted by this Regional Center. Local business organizations will engage the Regional Center for the purpose of: providing consultancy services related to securing private equity investment in the company; marketing the company to potential qualified international investors; identifying professional service providers necessary for attraction and completion of international investment. Local business organizations will be charged a fixed consultancy fee per project in order to benefit from such services. This is a flat fee and has no relation to the total amount of foreign direct investment raised during specific projects. of this consultancy fee will be paid during the initial phase of a project and is non-refundable. will be paid once the investment has been completed, i.e., funds are released after 1-526 is approved. Fees will be collected to cover the amount of work that will take for the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC to attract potential foreigner investors. This consultancy fee cannot be covered using EB-5 investor funds raised during specific projects. Local business organizations will have to cover these expenses using a separate source of funds. Local business organizations will be informed of this fee structure before engaging the services of the ND/NW MN EB-5 RC. The ND/NW MN EB-5 RC will provide client service agreements to both investors and local companies (Appendix C) involved in this process. These documents will set expectations and delineate all services being provided during specific projects. The investment by the EB5 investor will be equity capital at a minimum of US $1 ,000,000 unless the company is principally doing business in a targeted employment area in which case it may be as low as US $500,000. The investment capital provide by the EB5 investor is not a loan; the investor will not be entitled to any guaranteed returns but may share in distributions of profits; the investor will not have a redemption right or any right to force the buy-out of his share at a particular price; the investor will be engaged in management of the company in some capacity; and the company will provide evidence of job creation using the IMPLAN-based methodology that is provided by the Foundation. Side by Side Investment Proposed Structure The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will work directly with 10 angel investment funds in North Dakota and Minnesota in order to identify potential deals and promote side-by-side investments between 24 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) American and foreign direct investors. The UND Center for Innovation has helped form these pooled angel funds and is currently supporting their operations and promotion. They are located in Grand Forks, Fargo, Wahpeton, and Bismarck, ND, and Fosston, MN. Additionally there are other funds that we are in close contact with for syndication. Return on Investment- The ROI for foreign investors is expected within 5 to 10 years after investment are made. Past investments through RAIN Source Capital Group have an average of 1 OX per investments, including only American investors. This ROI average will be used to attract potential investors; however the regional center will inform its clients that that information was used for marketing purposes, and that this is not a guarantee that investors will receive equal or similar ROI. Transparency- Progress documents and reports will be periodically provided to potential investors. They will also have access to deal reports and other information through a website - Angel Soft (www.angelsoft.net). All deals performed in this region are uploaded into this secure website so investors can closely monitor their investment. Quarterly updates will also be provided. The Center for Innovation has substantial experience related to managing investments acquired by founding and operating 10 angel investment groups in North Dakota and Minnesota. Similar managing and operations structures will be used to give investors and entrepreneurs clarity and security during the investment process. Summary: The examples above delineate how the North Dakota/Northwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Center will promote, market, and operate projects promoted by this Regional Center. It also demonstrates how administration fees and consultancy fees will be applied to both immigrant investors and commercial enterprises during an EB-5 project. The regional center plans to evaluate the creation of new direct and indirect jobs by using economic multiplier models. IMP LAN will be the methodology used to prove job creation. Individual reports will be provided both to USC IS and investors to ensure all requirements are met thus allowing foreign investors to acquire Green Cards. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC is excited to provide additional information for a regional center designation in order to administer foreign direct investment into the US. The regional center will strive to provide high quality and professional services, and ensure all the requirements related to foreign direct investments are met, allowing both local commercial organizations and foreign investors to benefit from this program. 25 .. < ~ c z w D..

I u~derstand the EB-5 Regional Center designation would be under the Innnigrant Investor Pilot. Program through the l!'.S. Inm1jgration & Citizenship S~rvices (USCIS).. ill, recent I'Jlonths, several cities throughout North Dakota and Not1hwest Minnesota have experienced levels of unemployment not seen in decadeS. North Dakota's largest manufacturer has closed one of its production facilities and the Grand Forks Air Force Base. was significantly dow11sized in tl1e last round of the Defense Base Closure and Realigrunent Commission (BRAC). Our rurill economy has been stressed by outmigt\u00b7ation, and an infusion of new Foreign Direct Investment under the EB-5 program and the resulting increase in jobs would greatly benefit ourregion. Desigt1ating Nm1h Dakota and Not1hwest Minnesota as a \"Regional Center\" under the Immigration Investor Pilot Program is a great oppot1unity to stimulate our regional. economy through investment in entrepreneurial ventures. Again, I am pleased to offer 111Y strong support for the UNO Center for Innovation Foundation's effm1s to establish an EB-5 Regional Center. Piease let me know if there is anything I can do to provide additional support to this effort.

Our state would greatly benefit from foreign investment and new jobs .from the EB-5 program. While North Dakota has experienced economic growth in the past two years, the manufacturing sector of our economy is feeling the effects of the national :recession. The Grand Forks area has also felt the effect$ of tl;le recent the BRAC round as the Grand Forks Air .Force Base lo~t its aerialre~~ling mission. The EB-5 ptogra.m will help our state.'s entrepreneprs and economic developers secure the vital in~e~t:ment for employment growth. The UND Center. for Innovation Foundation is well positioned to lead this_ effort as they have been working with. entrepreneurs and angei investors successfully for '25 years. Through the \"Regionai Center\" designation under the Immigrant Inv:estor'Pilot Program, an opportunity exists to allow the EB-5 Regional Cent~r to foster investment in job-creating ventures in the state of North Dakotl1 and northwe!ltern Minnesota thus providing an economic stimulus tQ the entire r_egion.

An EB-5 Regional Center will provide us with the re~ourcesto generate new business d.evelopl1lent and growth through the attraction of investment dollars into North Dakota and Northwestern Minnesota. The North Dakota Department of Commerce strongly supports the UND Center for Innovation Foundation's efforts to establisl) an EB-5 Region~l Center. Your approval ofthis application ~will result in positive benefits for the State ofNorth Dakota, Northwestern Minnesota and the United States as a whole.

Salminen Chair, Becker County Board of Commissioners 71 October 6, 2009 RE: Support of EB-5 Regional Center for North Dakota and Northwest of Minnesota To Whom It May Concern: I write in support of UND Center for Innovation Foundation efforts to secure an EB-5 Regional Center designation for the entire state of North Dakota and 20 counties in Northwest Minnesota under the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program through the U.S. Immigration & Citizenship Services (\"USCIS). As the region faces economic challenges, it is imperative that local municipalities, counties, government, and the private sector work together toward stimulating the local economy and bringing jobs to the unemployed and attracting new businesses to locate in our region. The EB-5 regional center initiative can act as a catalyst to attract investment in identified growth sectors for the region defined and has the potential to be a key component of our economic development efforts in the future. Through the \"Regional Center\" designation under the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program an opportunity exists to allow the EB-5 Regional Center to invest in job-creating projects in the state of North Dakota and Northwest of Minnesota thus providing an economic stimulus to the entire region. I urge support of UND Center for Innovation Foundation efforts to establish an EB-5 Regional Center for the state of North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota.

Q) ~ ~ Targeted Employment Area Designation The Minnesota Department of Commerce is designated by the governor to certify the geographic areas or political subdivisions that conform to targeted employment areas as defined by 8 CFR 204.6 (e)(i),(e)(ii) and f(2), f(3). Definitions Targeted Employment Area: An area which, at the time of investment, is a rural area or an area which has experienced unemployment of at least 150 percent of the national average rate. The amount of capital necessary to make a qualifying investment in a targeted employment area within the United States is $500,000. Rural Area: Any area not within either a metropolitan statistical area as designated by the Office of Management and Budget or the outer boundary of any city or town having a population of 20,000 or more. High Employment Area: A part of a metropolitan statistical area that at the time of investment (i) is not a targeted employment area and (ii) is an area with an employment rate significantly below the national average unemployment rates. The amount of capital necessary to make a qualifying investment within the United States as defined in section 203(b )(5)(C)(iii) of the Act, is $1,000,000. Methodology Under the federal.definition of targeted employment area the Minnesota Department of Commerce certifies any rural area within the state as a targeted employment area, excluding rural county cities with populations of 20,000 or more that have unemployment rates falling short of 150 percent of the national average unemployment rate. All official metropolitan statistical areas are also excluded unless a geographic area or political subdivision within the metropolitan area -such as counties, cities, census tracks, census blocks or a combination -have in the aggregate an unemployment rate at least 150 percent of the national unemployment rate. The department will calculate these combinations on a case by case basis as requested. To be designated targeted employment areas at the county level, all counties except those counties included in metropolitan statistical areas qualify. Cities with populations in excess of 20,000 located in rural counties are excluded from the designation unless the 150 percent national average unemployment provision is met. Cities, census tracks, blocks or townships with rates of at least 150 percent of the national average unemployment rate located inside metropolitan statistical areas are automatically designated as targeted employment areas. A census track or a combination of contiguous geography may be designated a TEA for as long as the combination of the unemployed divided by labor force for such an area is at least 150 percent of the national average unemployment rate for the preceding 12 months of available labor force data. The 150 percent of the national average unemployment rate used for this year's determination is 11.35 percent. Upon request, the Minnesota Department of Commerce will calculate whether a combination of census tracts make up a qualifying contiguous geographic area with 150 percent of the national average unemployment rate. If a region qualifies, the department will provide a letter to the requesting (__ 1 77 entity designating the region as high unemployment area for its submission for EB status to the Department of Homeland Security. For high unemployment census tracts the labor force data sets used to determine the national average unemployment rate consist of benchmarked data from July to December and the available preliminary data from January to June. For computational purposes, TEA determinations are made in November of each year to be effective during the following full calendar year.

The proposed ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC is applying for designation to target foreign investment in seven areas. These areas include: 1. Agribusiness, 2. Manufacturing, 3. Aviation/Aerospace, 4. Information Technology, 5. Biotechnology, 6. Energy generation, and 7. Real Estate Development. These areas were chosen to complement the available resources and growth in the region. The region's resources include abundant agricultural land, a highly productive labor force, and an expanding infrastructure. While the US economy has suffered during the recent recession, North Dakota's Gross Domestic Product grew at 7.3% in 2008, which was the highest among all states according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Adding to this economic strength is an unemployment rate of 3.7% in August of 2010, which is the lowest in the nation, and a state budget surplus projected to be nearly a billion dollars. 1-0 Model The annual economic impact is estimated here using IMPLAN, a statistical software program that builds the predictive model for input-output analysis. The economic impact of direct investment in a firm is the sum of three components; the direct effect, the indirect effect and the induced effect. When a manufacturing firm increases production due to an increase in investment they also need employees and materials, which will depend on the capital intensity of the industry.1 This increase in output due to the increase in capital and labor is known as the direct effect. The direct effect will be entirely captured in the industry/sector, which receives the investment. This is despite the fact that our manufacturing firm may increase the number of employees engaged in research and development or administrative operations, such as accounting, and financial forecasting, which are areas included in other classifications. The treatment here is consistent with NAICS, which classifies these activities as manufacturing. 1 The capital intensity of an industry is defined as the portion of the value added to GOP from an industry that is not contributed by labor. Capital density is found here using 2007 National Income and Product Accounts data by NAICS sector from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. . 1 . . total total value added 1 Because of the interdependence of the economy, changes in the economic activity in one sector will ripple into other sectors as well. Increasing production at a manufacturing firm will require their suppliers and service providers to also increase production, which is the indirect effect. Finally, the increase in household spending caused by the increases in payroll from the additional hiring (direct and indirect) is referred to as the induced effect. Thus the direct effects can be thought of as the stone that is tossed into the pond and the rippleS! generated by the stone's impact are analogous to the indirect and induced effects. Consequently the economic impact resulting from increased employment spreads throughout the economy impacting virtually all sectors of the region's economy. In our analysis we report; for each area of investment, the direct, indirect, induced, and total economic impact of an investment of one million dollars on the demand for output, employment and household earnings. Our\u00b7analysis also reports the impacts of employment and output broken down by 2.-digit NAICS sector, which in\u00b7cludes business services, utilities, maintenance and repair/construction. AGRIBUSINESS Agribusiness, NAICS sector 11 (Ag, Forestry, Fish & Hunting}, includes firms primarily engaged in growing crops and raising animals or firms associated with farm operations, such as soil preparation, planting and harvesting. Farming is North Dakota's largest economic sector. According to BEA data for 2007, farming contributed 3 billion dollars to the state's 28.5 billion dollars of Gross Domestic Product. North Dakota is the country's largest producer in spring wheat, durum, barley, sunflowers, and dry edible beans to name just a few. Agricultural products are North Dakota's largest export, totaling 1.9 billion dollars in 2006. Rising crop prices have played an important role .in North Dakota's economic success by raising household earnings and state tax revenues. 2 ' (b) (4) MANUFACTURING Manufacturing, NAICS sectors 31-33, includes manufacturing of durable and non\u00ad durable goods. Firms in this sector are described by NAICS as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power driven machines and materials handling equipment. In North Dakota manufacturing is one of the largest economic sectors. According to BEA data for 2007, manufacturing contributed 2.6 Billion dollars to the state's 28.5 Billion dollars of Gross Domestic Product. Export of machinery, comprised 46% of North Dakota's export shipments in 2007, with the export of tractors as the single most exported good. 3 (b) (4) (b) (4)\\ ECONOMIC IMPACT OF MANUFACTURING ON THE REGION AVIATION/AEROSPACE Aviation and Aerospace, NAICS sector 3364 (Other transportation equipment manufacturing), includes aerospace product and parts manufacturing. North Dakota has a rich aviation tradition as represented by the US Air Force bases located in Minot and Grand Forks, which opened in 1959 and 1957 respectively. At their peak, during the height of the Cold War, each base was home to nearly 14,000 personnel. Today, realignment in these two bases has led to significant force reduction. The base in Grand Forks is currently transitioning to a new mission, which involves the Air Force's deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles. Grand Forks, ND is also home to the University of North Dakota and its world recognized School of Aerospace Science. UNO as an existing leader in the training of pilots was named by the 4 (b) (4)'~ Governor in 2006 to be a Center of Excellence for the Economic Development of unmanned aerial vehicles. While aviation and aerospace only contributed 115 million dollars to the state's 28.5 Billion dollars of Gross Domestic Product, access to skilled workers in the field and increased demand by the military and Department of Homeland Secwity make this a natural area to promote in our region. 5 (b) (4) INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Information technology, NAICS sector 51 (lnformatiorl), includes the publishing industries, including software publishing, and both traditional publishing and publishing exclusively on the Internet; the broadcasting industries, including traditional broadcasting and those broadcasting exclus_ively over the Internet; the telecommunications industries.. In North Dakota information technology is a rather significant industry. According to BEA data for 2007, .information technology contributed 977 million dollars to the state's 28.5 Billion dollars of Gross Domestic Product. .6 (b) (4) BIOTECHNOLOGY Biotechnology, NAICS sector 5417 (Scientific research and development services) includes firms engaged in conducting original research to develop new knowledge and/or the application of research to improve products and processes. Agricultural biotechnology, which is the development of genetically modified foods, offers the potential to improve the health benefits of crops while increasing yields. Expansion of agricultural biotechnology in the region takes advantage of the important role that agriculture plays in North Dakota's economy and the rest of the country. This is evident by the recent expansion by Monsanto, a biotechnology firm based in St Louis, MO, which in 2010 expanded its production facility in West Fargo, ND. 7 (b) (4) (b) (4) ECONOMIC IMPACT OF BIOTECHNOLOGY ON THE REGION POWER GENERATION NAICS sector 22 (Utilities), includes firms primarily engaged in the provision of the following utility services: electric power, natural gas, steam supply, water supply and sewage. According to BEA data for 2007, \u00b7utilities contributed 761 million dollars to the state's 28.5 billion dollars of Gross Domestic Product. Among coal producing states, North Dakota ranks ninth and produces 3 percent of the nation'!) output. Easy access to coal makes power generation a natural industry to promote 8 (b) (4) (b) (4) ECONOMIC IMPACT OF POWER GENERATION ON THE REGION REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT Real Estate Development, NAICS sector 53, includes real estate development, rental and leasing. It is North Dakota's fourth largest sector after agricUlture, manufacturing, and health care. According to BEA data for 2007, real estate development contributed 2.3 Billion dollars to the state's 28.5 Billion dollars of Gross Domestic Product, Low unemployment and rising household incomes have allowed North Dakota's property owners to avoid the substantial 9 (b) (4) (b) (4) declines in commercial and residential properties seen elsewhere. The National Association of Realtors reports that in 2010, total sales increased by 52%, which was the highest rate nationwide. This indicates there remains support for additional development to support the region's growth. For purposes of this analysis we consider\u00b7 the impact of an investment in a restaurant. ECONOMIC IMPACT OF REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT ON THE REGION 10 (b) (4) (b) (4) Summary: The industries selected for the regional center are those for which North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota have the greatest competitive advantage. For example, although the area has some of the necessary resources such as water, iron mills were not chosen because hauling the ore to the area would nat be cost-effective. On the other hand, a~ribusiness is included because the region leads the nation in production of 14 major crops and in innovative development of agribusiness-related renewable energies. Given those factors, there is a high degree of probability that at the end of the Eb-5 Regional Center as many as would invest at.least $1,000,000 each. That co.uld lead to an increase in total.output of over . Sales would increase about and Gross State Product for both North Dakota and Minnesota would increase about . Total tax collections in both states would increase about . Finally, we would expect job creation to total nearly positions, a huge increase for this area.

Please contact the appropriate U.S. consulate directly if you have any questions about visa issuance. For nonimmigrant petitions, the beneficiary should contact the consulate after receiving our approval notice. For approved immigrant petitions, the beneficiary should wait to be contacted by consulate. If the beneficiary is now in the United States and believes he or she may be eligible for the new status without going abroad for a visa, he or she should use InfoPass to contact a local USCIS oftice about applying here.

Form I-797E (Rev. 05/05/06) Page 2 'I e UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center /W0900 17 60 Page 2 The Immigrant Investor Pilot Program (\"Pilot Program\") was created by Section 610 of Public Law 102- 395 (October 6, 1992). This is different in certain ways from the basic EB-5 investor program. The Pilot Program began in accordance with a Congressional mandate aimed at stimulating economic activity and creating jobs for U.S. workers, while simultaneously affording eligible aliens the opportunity to become lawful permanent residents. Through this innovative program, foreign investors are encouraged to\u00b7 invest funds in an economic unit known as a \"Regional Center.\" A Regional Center is defined as any economic unit, public or private, engaged in the promotion of economic growth, improved regional productivity, job creation and increased domestic capital investment. 8 CFR 204.6 (m)(3) describes specific evidence that must be submitted before consideration for eligibility for this benefit may proceed. After review of your proposal in the light of these requirements, the following information, evidence or clarification is needed to proceed. It is always best to start with a cover letter that acts as an executive summary followed by a table of contents of the various tabbed sections to follow. Mandatory Evidence for the Basic General Proposal Regional or National impact of the Regional Center (8 CFR 204.6 (m)(3)(iv)): Regulations at 8 CFR 204.6(m)(3)(iv) require that the proposal contain: ... a detailed prediction regarding the manner in which the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy in general as reflected by such factors as increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and without the regional center; Even though the proposal contains an Economic Impact Study by Investment, Output, Employment, Sales, and Taxes, a review of the proposal indicates that a detailed prediction has not been provided regarding the manner in which the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy with respect to increased household earnings. greater demand for business services. utilities. maintenance and repair. and construction both within and without the regional center. Provide a detailed prediction, which includes the topics of regional or national impact on household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and outside the Regional Center. This can be combined with job creation and overall economic impact. Again, this impact statement relates to the Regional Center as a whole and it should address both the negative and positive impacts. ATTACHMENT TO 1-797 lj e UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center /W0900 I7 60 Page 3 Economic Entity: e Evidence has not been provided to show that the regional center is an economic entity. Provide evidence that the Regional Center qualifies as an economic entity. This evidence may include incorporation papers, partnership agreements or other documentation showing the regional center is an economic entity. Evidence or claim to future incorporation or other legal event is not sufficient. The regional center must currently be an economic unit and not a future economic unit. Indirect Job Creation (8 CFR 204.6(m)(3)(ii)): Under the provisions of the INA which apply to the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program and specific amendments to the statute, especially in the 2002 amendment Per Pu.blic Law I07-273, enacted November 2, 2002, which clearly states: A regional center shall have jurisdiction over a limited geographic area, which shall be described in the proposal and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones. The establishment of a regional center may be based on general predictions, contained in the proposal, concerning the kinds of commercial enterprises that will receive capital from aliens, the jobs that will be created directly or indirectly as a result of such capital investments and the other positive economic effects such capital investments will have. Also 8 CFR 204.6(m)(3)(ii) requires you to: Provide in verifiable detail how jobs will be created indirectly; It is imperative to fully explain indirect job creation, as well as the direct and induced jobs, if any. The requirement of creating at least I 0 new full-time (3 5 hours per week) jobs per each individual alien investor may be satisfied by showing that, as a result of the investment and the activities of the new enterprise, at least 10 jobs per alien investor will be created directly or indirectly through an employment creation multiplier effect. The econometric model described in the case is the IMPLAN Model. Although the proposal included an Economic Analysis for the seven industry clusters (Agribusiness, machinery manufacturing, aviation/ aerospace, information technologies/ communications, biotech/bioscience, construction and real estate development and utilities), a hypothetical investment plan for each industry project type was not submitted to show how an investment project will be capitalized and operated in a manner that will create I 0 direct and indirect jobs or an actual investment plan for a specific proposed project. ATTACHMENT TO I-797 II e UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center/W0900 17 60 Page 4 e For multiple industries a combination of hypothetical and actual plans may be submitted. The plan must clearly identify how the investor funds will flow to the job creating entity and how the jobs will be created. If your exemplar plans are based on an investment in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA), you must submit evidence that the proposed plan is located within a designated Targeted Employment Area. See below for details on documenting a TEA designation. Because the regional center potentially includes real estate development, details should be provided with respect how to the completion timeframe (in years and months) for each project to include projected milestones and how direct job creation will be verified. Provide a description with supporting data of how, by the point of the I-829 filing stage, the underlying new direct jobs will be verified. Clearly specify the timeframes (by month and year) when and how the direct and indirect jobs will materialize for each regional center project. Also, provide the timeframe for completing each project, including project milestones and timelines for which direct job creation is based on and correlate these project milestone and timelines to direct and indirect job creation. When relying on econometric models for indirect job creation1 it is imperative that \"direct jobs\" will be real identifiable jobs supported by wage reports or I-9 forms otherwise they must be explicitly identified as hypothetical in nature. Another method would be to predict jobs based on dollar amount invested in the overall project and this too must be made clear. This distinction will be critical at the I-829 removal of condition stage of the immigration process. Regional Center's Operational Plan {8 CFR 204.6{m) and 8 CFR 204.6): A review of the proposal indicates that a description of the plans to administer, oversee, and manage the proposed Regional Center was not provided. 1 USCIS does not accept or credit creation of direct temporary \"construction jobs\" within a business plan or economic job creation forecasts activities which involve a limited duration construction phase of less than 3 years unless the scope, complexity, and the ongoing construction phase must be fully sustained for all the construction phase jobs for 3 years or more with respect to the size, scope, nature, engineering/technology challenges and breadth of the project--for example a massive-scale nuclear power facility, or major Dam or a giant oil refinery, or similar type of massive and expansive and major engineering project. Shorter term construction jobs less than three years in duration have been determined to be of such a short term in nature as to not be sustained and to decrease and disappear as the initial construction activities wind down to completion. Such shorter term construction jobs in many locations are seasonal at best. Nevertheless, for all capital investment expenditures for the construction phase, all capital-induced \"down-stream\" support activities and \"indirect\" jobs impacted and associated with the construction activities such as suppliers, transportation, engineering and architectural services, maintenance and repair services, interior design services, manufacturing of components and materials, etc., may be factored into the calculations for creation of indirect jobs. ATTACHMENT TO I-797 , .. e UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center /W0900 17 60 Page 5 Administrative Oversight: e The regulations at 8 CFR 204.6(m)(6), require that an approved Regional Center in order to maintain the validity of its approval and designation, must continue to meet the statutory requirements of the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program by serving the purpose of promoting economic growth, including increased export sales (where applicable), improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment. Therefore, in order for USCIS to determine whether an approved and designated Regional Center is in compliance with the above cited regulation, and in order to continue to operate as a USCIS approved and designated Regional Center, your administration, oversight, and management of your Regional Center shall be such as to monitor all investment activities under the sponsorship of your Regional Center and to maintain records, data and information on a quarterly basis in order to report to USCIS upon request the following year to date information for each Federal Fiscal Year2, commencing with the initial year as follows: o Submit a description of your plans to administer, oversee, and manage the proposed Regional Center, including but not limited to such things as to identify, assess and evaluate proposed immigrant investor projects and enterprises; how the proposed Regional Center would perform \"due diligence\" as to whether investment capital to be sought will consist solely of alien investor capital or a combination of alien investor capital and domestic capital; how to monitor all investment activities affiliated, through or under the sponsorship of the proposed Regional Center, and to maintain records, data and information on projects, investors, business activities, etc., in order to report to USCIS for each Federal Fiscal Year. This is known as \"due diligence\" and is coupled with \"oversight reporting responsibilities\" to be fully explained if approved and designated. Optional Evidence-- To be used by the commercial enterprise under the auspices of the Regional Center USCIS will review the documents listed below to determine if they are in compliance with EB-5 eligibility requirements. By providing these documents, the Regional Center may facilitate the adjudication of relating I-526 petitions by identifying, up front, any issues that could pose problems at the Immigrant Investor Petition level. The business aspects of the commercial enterprise must be fully explained as to its structure. Provide the following documents as it relates to the regional center.

For the past year, the CIF has been studying the possibility of acquiring the status of a Regional Center in order to administrate and manage foreign direct investment though the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Regional Center Pilot Program. The CIF, in conjunction with other public and private entities, will help market and promote investment opportunities in the state of North Dakota and in Northwest Minnesota. The principal identities in this project have worked together closely on entrepreneurial, international, and financial projects. They are Bruce Gjovig-CEO of CIF and Director of the Center for Innovation, Rodrigo Cintra --International Marketing Director/ Entrepreneur Consultant, and Tom Kenville- Rainmaker and V.P. of Development. Additional information about the principals is found in the \"Principals of Regional Center'' section of this application as well as in Appendix A. Moreover, these contacts will be responsible for promoting, processing and managing EB-5 international investments attracted by the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. In addition, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will coordinate with multiple private and public entities in the states of North Dakota and Minnesota such as the government of North Dakota, the North Dakota Trade Office (NDTO), North Dakota Department of Commerce (NDDOC}, Minnesota Economic Improvement Commission, and others. The ND/NW- MN EB-5 RC will be located at the Ina Mae Rude Entrepreneur Center, owned and managed by the Center for Innovation Foundation. The Foundation is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit that supports the Center for Innovation. The Center for Innovation is a department of the University of North Dakota with mission and goals of innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment. The specific geographic area for this Regional Center includes the entire state of North Dakota and 20 counties in Northwest Minnesota, more specifically Kittson, Roseau, Marshall, Pennington, Beltrami, Red Lake, Polk, Norman, Clay, Otter Tail, Douglas, Pope, Traverse, Stevens, Wilkin, Becker, Mahnomen, Clearwater, Grant, and Lake of the Woods counties. Those specific counties in Minnesota are included because they share similar demographics, industries and economies with the state of North Dakota. Those areas in North Dakota and the northwest part of Minnesota are, for the most part, considered targeted employment areas (TEA) by the Federal Government. This designation lowers the minimum amount that must be invested by foreign investors. Normally the minimum amount of investment is US$1 ,000,000, but if investments are in a TEA the minimum investment is US$ 500,000. North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota have innumerous areas that classify as TEAs. With that in mind, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to attract a larger volume of investments in the half million dollar bracket but it is also prepared to receive $1,000,000 investments. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to focus on the following specific industries: Agribusiness Machinery Manufacturing Aviation/ Aerospace Information Technologies/ Communications Biotech I Bioscience Construction and Real Estate Development: Rural/Urban Renewal/ Multi-Mixed Use. Utilities (Electric Power Generation) Those industries were chosen because of their: 1. Consistency with strategic economic development goals in both states. 2. North Dakota industry strengths: North Dakota leads the 2 nation in agribusiness as top producer of 14 major crops and is a primary innovator in the development of agribusiness related renewable energies, including wind, value added identity preserved foods, and agribusiness related biotech vaccines/medical remedies. 3. University graduate program strengths/incubator possibilities to develop new businesses with ties to our research and technology parks and center(s) for innovation relating to electrical engineering, polymers and coatings, and renewable energy development from crops. 4. Construction and real estate development is primarily focused on renewing rural downtown areas and developing other projects situated in urban areas. Highly successful programs have been developed turning downtowns into professional services, entertainment, and chic boutique areas along with urban apartments. Of these, we believe there are many potential projects that could be generated per year in the communities of Grand Forks and Fargo alone. Some will be at pre-angel stage, some in mature industries looking to expand into new international markets requiring angel or loan funding. The plan is to augment EB-5 funding with other equity funds through side-by-side investments with each project evaluated accordingly. CENTER FOR INNOVATION FOUNDATION GOALS The purpose of establishing the Center for Innovation Foundation as a USC IS EB-5 Regional Center is strictly related to: Attract foreign direct investment into the state of North Dakota and into Northwest Minnesota in order to generate economic development, create new jobs and increase domestic capital investment. Currently we are working with Brazilian, South Korean, Chinese, Canadian and other investment groups to establish a model to bring investment, jobs, and students to North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota. Create partnerships between American private investors and international investors (side-by -side investments) in order to give credibility to all investment deals proposed by the North Dakota/ Northwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Center as well as to attract new potential investors. Interested parties include: HK Investors group, RAIN Funds, Bison Ventures, and North Dakota Development Fund. Other entities are being identified and will be included in the project in the future. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will work as a source of creation for direct and indirect jobs for EB-5 immigrant investment projects. The 1M PLAN model will be utilized in order to evaluate Regional Center direct and indirect job creation. This part of the project will be administered with the assistance of the University of North Dakota, more specifically, the UNO economics department. Prospective domestic participants will be identified through access to NO Trade Office client base, RAIN investor base, Center for Innovation client base, and economic development groups across state. Provide a vehicle for investing in expanding companies with export potential to allow immigrant investors eligibility under the USC IS Regional Center Pilot Program. Companies will be selected for the Regional Center Program based on (i) job creation potential and (ii) the signing of a contract by the company ensuring compliance with the EB-5 program; and; Secure administration fees by working with international investors and local businesses interested in the EB-5 Immigration Visa Program. Administration fees will cover services provided by the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC related to deal overview, deal referrals, tracking documentation, and compiling and providing any necessary reporting documentation to USCIS. Moreover, investments will be organized on a side-by-side basis where both foreign investors and American investors will be able to jointly invest in determined projects. This side-by\u00ad side element will be in place to give foreign investors a sense of security and legitimacy related to 3 investment projects promoted by the North Dakota/ Northwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Center. This also provides leverage to American investors. In addition, expanding companies can highly benefit from new funding alternatives. This new regional center will aim at generating economic development activity, creating new direct and indirect jobs, and increasing domestic capital for investment. The center will take advantage of its connections with the Rain Source Capital Funds in order to identify and screen potential companies and generate deal flow. Currently there are 5 angel investment funds in North Dakota and Minnesota which have been formed and are administered with the assistance of the Center for Innovation. They are located in Fargo, Grand Forks, Bismarck, and Wahpeton, ND and Fosston, MN. They will serve as a checkpoint to pre\u00ad screen deals and perform due diligence. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to generate deal flow through these Angel Funds. We expect that up to 10 potential side-by-side investment deals will be generated each year. GEOGRAPHIC REGION The North Dakota/Northwest Regional Center geographic area will include the entire state of North Dakota and 20 counties in northwest Minnesota. The state of North Dakota and 20 northwest Minnesota counties are very similar in terms of industry and demographics. Although it is a large geographic area to cover, both areas combined have a population of only 1 ,005,000 people. (North Dakota with a total population of 641 ,481 and Northwest Minnesota with 363,594). It is important for the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC to incorporate this entire region as it will facilitate the process of identifying and developing potential leads. Below are three maps that illustrate the region that this Regional Center will serve: North Dakota- Minnesota Region: North Dakota statewide and Northwest of Minnesota.

Companies and the states can highly benefit from foreign direct investment. This initiative can potentially strengthen the regional economic environment and generate a substantial number of new direct and indirect jobs. More information about the North Dakota geographic region and economy is found in the \"Industry Focus\" section. Moreover, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC includes 20 counties in Northwest Minnesota. The reason behind this decision is because both regions have similar industries and economies sharing the same trade area. The map below gives a broad view of the area where Kittson, Roseau, Marshall, Pennington, Beltrami, Red Lake, Polk, Norman, Clay, Otter Tail, Douglas, Pope, Traverse, Stevens, Wilkin, Becker, Mahnomen, Clearwater, Grant, and Lake of the Woods counties are located.

The Foundation is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit that supports the Center for Innovation which is a department of the University of North Dakota with mission and goals of innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment. The UNO Center for Innovation at the University of North Dakota mentors, advises, and consults with innovators, entrepreneurs, students and researchers to launch new ventures, commercialize new technologies and secure access to capital from private and public sources. It was among the first entrepreneur outreach centers in the nation when formed in 1984. 25 years later, the UNO Center for Innovation operates two incubator facilities in the UNO Tech Park: the Norm Skalicky Tech Incubator and the Ina Mae Rude Entrepreneur Center. These incubators are seedbeds that help emerging entrepreneurs grow new ventures and viable businesses. Moreover, the Center for Innovation has been working with international clients since 1992, working to bring foreign-based technology ventures into the U.S. market by developing export entry plans, conducting market research, locating distribution, manufacturing, development partners and providing a reputable foreign base of operations. All these services are still being provided by the center. In 2006 the center was designated a Soft Landing International Incubator, one of only 11 in the world by the National Business Incubator Association (NBIA). The center received this recognition because it has proven itself as a business incubator that helps companies expand internationally. The UNO Center for Innovation has assisted with the launch of more than 460 products and businesses since 1984 and has won national, regional and state awards including: The national 6 Tibbetts Award in 1996 and 1998 in recognition of contributions to the SBIR program and technology innovation; the national Small Business Administration's (SBA) Vision 2000 Award in 1999 for tech entrepreneurship; The Region VII (a six-state region) SBA Small Business Research Advocate Award in 2003; the state chamber of commerce's Entrepreneurial Spirit award in 2003; and the state Governor's Choice Innovator of the Year Award in 2009. The center was a finalist for two national awards in 2009 as well, named 151 runner-up for the Incubator Innovation Award by the National Business Incubation Association and named a finalist for the Excellence in Rural Economic Development award by the US Economic Development Administration. In addition, the center's programs have been instrumental in UNO's ranking in the top 1% of collegiate entrepreneurship programs nationwide four years in a row by Princeton Review and Entrepreneur Magazine. The Center's Brochures and other marketing material are included in Appendix E. INDUSTRY FOCUS: AN ECONOMIC PICTURE OF NORTH DAKOTA AND PART OF NORTHWEST MINNESOTA Over the past quarter of a century, North Dakota's population has reflected both the level of technology in agriculture and the demand for energy and energy technology. In 2008, the population was nearly 639,000. In 2000 it was just over 642,000. Even within that nine year period the level of population varied as significant decreases in population occurred when new, larger farm machinery appeared. However, within that same time the demand for energy increased rapidly and what may be the largest reserve of oil ever discovered in North America was found within the state (the Bakken Formation), making North Dakota the 4th largest oil producing state in America. These changes in oil recovery attracted a significant increase in population somewhat offsetting the decrease caused by new agricultural technologies. Initially because of its coal reserves, energy has played an important economic role in North Dakota while it has been virtually non-existent in Minnesota. Now with increased interest in the development of alternative energy such as biofuels, solar, and wind energy, energy may become more significant to the twenty county region of northwest Minnesota. Those new technologies also apply to North Dakota, especially wind energy. In 2006 North Dakota produced 724 trillion Btus of energy, or one percent of the total production in the U.S. Because of the large production of power in the state the price paid for electricity in North Dakota in 2006 was among the lowest in the nation. In fact, electricity is twice as expensive in New England. North Dakota's future in energy will only become more important as time passes. As the result of wind tests that have been completed by the government, North Dakota has been called the Saudi Arabia of wind. That is because the wind blows more consistently at a rapid enough speed to produce electricity than any other place in the nation. The Bakken formation alone may be the largest quantity of oil ever discovered in North America and the Sanish formation, while too early to be certain, may be even larger. Also, for more than a decade, the political leaders in North Dakota have made a very specific effort to make the state more like the rest of the nation in terms of expanding the manufacturing base and in a related effort in keeping and attracting young people to the state. The program has had mixed success. The state was successful in expanding manufacturing, particularly in agriculture and energy. The state also became the location of a major facility for the largest manufacturer of private airplanes and a manufacturer of blades for a major worldwide wind generation company. As with most manufacturers, the recent economic difficulties have had an adverse effect on manufacturing in the state. However, the most recent data appears to indicate that these firms are recovering rapidly from those economic setbacks. North Dakota is a homogeneous area, both in the makeup of its economy and its population. Although significant changes have occurred in the past decade, it is accurate to describe North 7 Dakota as dominated by Caucasians. Native Americans are the only minority population of any significance, and even they represent a relatively small percent of the total. On the other hand, when it comes to factors such as education, and women-owned businesses, North Dakota is much like the balance of the United States. In fact, women es_pecially have always played an important role in the states business community. Manufacturing tends to be dominated by agricultural firms with both Case IH and John Deere having major manufacturing plants in the state. However, North Dakota is also home to one of Microsoft's and Amazon's major campuses. One additional modern and futuristic industry in which North Dakota is becoming a major player in is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or UAVs. In the last round of the Base Realignment and Closing (BRAC) the Grand Forks Air Force Base was downsized but designated one of the United States Air Force's UAV bases. Already stationed at the base are first generations UAVs and second generation UAVs are scheduled to arrive very soon. In addition, the plans call for the assignment of Air Force personnel in support of the UAV mission. It is expected that because of the UAV experimentation many private UAV manufacturing personnel will also be stationed at the Air Force Base. Related to, but independent from the base designation is the UAV Center of Excellence program at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. The University of North Dakota's aviation program has been listed one of the outstanding post secondary aviation programs in the US. The Center of Excellence designation by the office of the Governor of North Dakota makes the program responsible for a large role in America's UAV future. North Dakota has also played an important role in the emerging biotechnology discipline and its developing industries. This is particularly true in the area of agriculture and the health sciences. Its emerging role in agriculture biotechnology is based on its natural agricultural base. Not only is the Upper Midwest an important growing area for small grains, it also area where many high value specialty crops such as potatoes, sugar beets, pulse crops like peas, sunflowers and edible beans, and many other crops are grown. Taken together, these specialty crops have allowed science to stave off worldwide food shortages. These scientific advances usually take place where the crops are grown, and in these cases that means North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. The personal health advances in biotechnology can occur in many geographic areas as long as an area has demonstrated a desire to do so. That desire has existed here for a long time. Studies have shown that when European settlers first arrived on the Great Plains they knew that they had to make life work for them. That tradition has carried down through the four and more generations since the arrival of those pioneers. That attitude has attracted others here because they know that the population of this area is willing to \"do what it takes\" to make a project succeed. That attitude has manifested itself in the public sector as well in the amount and type of research being conducted both at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and at North Dakota State University, particularly in the School of Pharmacy. In the private sector the most significant research and commercialization has occurred within Pracs Institute which is headquartered in Fargo, North Dakota, and has a second research facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. Other biotechnology firms have also been established across North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, especially over the past decade. As with the agricultural biotechnology, human health biotechnology, its research and successful \u00b7 commercialization is a stated goal of the university system. This has created a culture of research aimed at reaching that goal. As with other business ideas in the Great Plains, the biggest obstacle has been a lack of capital. Like those business ideas, it has often been difficult to get those with the money to invest to understand the attitudes here. Located on the Canadian border, North Dakota also plays a major role in both Canadian agriculture and Canadian energy. North Dakota is the entry point for Canadian tar sands oil and commercial fertilizers, as well as hydroelectric power. Because of the large manufacturing base located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and in other areas of the prairie provinces, and the two way 8 transportation flow of finished goods, eastern North Dakota is called the Red River Trade Corridor. This is an historic trade route dating back initially to trade among the Native American tribes as well as the fur trade between Europeans and Native Americans from Winnipeg through St. Paul, Minnesota. The only significant change in the region's economics over the past decade occurred as in the same categories as in the rest of the nation, income levels and housing values. The income levels are a reflection mostly of inflation as income has increased to reflect the devaluing of the dollar. However, over this period North Dakota has had some real growth in income and that also has contributed to the increase in the average salaries earned. As for housing values, especially over the particular time period, North Dakota did not participate in the changes in mortgage standards as did most of the nation. Most mortgages were based on an ability to pay and as a result proportionately very few expensive homes were built. That means that while values did increase to reflect both inflation and increases in real income the increases were considerably less than what occurred across the nation. Most data listed for North Dakota is not available for the twenty county region in Minnesota covered in this application for regional center status. It is accurate to state that this region is regarded as essentially being similar to North Dakota. In fact, any research that has been completed demonstrates that most data from that twenty county Minnesota region is more similar to North Dakota than it is to even the average of the rest of the state of Minnesota, and certainly to several of the other regions of Minnesota. In particular this is true of comparing this twenty county region to what is regarded as the seven county metropolitan region surrounding Minneapolis and St. Paul. Because of the significant difference in the major crops and livestock, the twenty county region is also very different than the agricultural areas in the southern one third to one half of Minnesota. It is only at the southern tip of the twenty county region that livestock has any real economic significance. The same is true for the higher valued corn and soybean row crops. There are some areas that would be different because of differences in geography. For example, much of the Minnesota region is in the heart of the lake country. Therefore, we would expect to find tourism more important in that region than in all of North Dakota. Finally, North Dakota currently has the lowest unemployment rate in the nation. That does not mean that the state is necessarily expanding on an economic basis. Rather, it is again the nature of the lessons learned by that homogeneous population that you must go where the jobs are. Most of our high school and college graduates (two out of three) leave the state to find a job. Therefore, they are not unemployed. On the other hand, whenever the state has expanded its job base, regardless of the level of skills required, employers have always been able to fill the jobs, usually by native sons and daughters returning to the state. Native sons and daughters' preferences are to return home. The only thing keeping them from doing so is the lack of available jobs. When the jobs arrive so will they. Under-employment is pervasive as many are working below their educational and experience level, waiting for new jobs to be created that better fit their abilities. Immediately below is a table providing certain relevant economic and other descriptive data 1.

This separate document was created to showcase the economic impact generated by foreign direct investment in North Dakota and 20 counties in Northwest Minnesota. It also emphasizes the job creation component of the EB- 5 initiative which is crucial for the immigration process. 1M PLAN was selected because it is approved by the USCIS. Full economic impact assessments will be provided to each individual project promoted by ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. These reports will be conducted by the University of North Dakota and supervised by Cullen Goenner, Associate Professor of Economics at University of North Dakota, and Ralph Kingsbury, a contracted professional economist. IMPLAN is a widely used input-output model and is commonly used in inter-agency analysis worldwide. PRINCIPALS OF REGIONAL CENTER The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC has defined the principal members who will be responsible for deal sourcing, operations, promotion, marketing, and reporting obligations. All principals have worked together closely on entrepreneurial, international, and financial projects. These members are: Bruce Gjovig -CIF CEO-Bruce has been North Dakota's \"go-to guy\" for entrepreneurship, innovation, and capital investing since he launched the Center for Innovation in 1984.

Other individuals supporting this initiative: Lincoln Stone-Stone & Grzegorek LLP, Los Angeles, CA (www.lskglaw.com) Ralph Kingsbury -Kingsbury Applied Economics, Grand Forks, ND (Contracted Economist) Dr. Cullen Goenner- Associate Professor of Economics, UNO Dr. Yong Hou-Center for Innovation Entrepreneur Consultant Harold Stanislawski- Fergus Falls Economic Improvement Commission- Executive Director Chris Teras -Teras Law Firm, Washington, DC Jordan Schuetzle -Schuetzle Law Firm, Grand Forks, ND The Center for Innovation Foundation has selected the principals based on their experience with capital markets and international business. They will be responsible for connecting with the USCIS as well as compiling and submitting any required reports, memos, or information. Bios and CV's of principals of the program are attached in the Appendix A section of this business plan. Moreover, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will also collaborate with the following entities: North Dakota Trade Office. Fargo ND (www.ndto.com) The North Dakota Trade Office is dedicated to expanding North Dakota exports to high-demand foreign markets through advocacy, education and expertise. The Trade Office is the catalyst in a collaborative effort among the state's universities, state and federal government agencies and private export service professionals that collectively provide North Dakota companies with the support they need to succeed in the global marketplace. The Trade Office's unique structure - a private-public partnership between the North Dakota Department of Commerce, the North Dakota District Export Council and the state's business community -enables it to move at the speed of international business. Organized in 2004, the North Dakota Trade Office conducts international market research for North Dakota companies, helping them identify export markets best suited for their products and services. Assisting companies in identifying the most promising export markets is just the beginning. To help companies capitalize, the Trade Office and its network of export service providers offer assistance in every step of the export process. Members of the Trade Office staff are located in Bismarck, Fargo, Dickinson and Grand Forks (Center for Innovation). North Dakota Department of Commerce. Bismarck ND (www.commerce.nd.gov) The North Dakota Department of Commerce is the state's lead economic development agency and is charged with coordinating and focusing the state's economic development resources. These efforts are made possible through working closely with local and regional developers across North Dakota. 11 The NO Department of Commerce's mission is to lead North Dakota's efforts to attract, retain and expand wealth. It strives to improve the quality of life of the people of North Dakota and targets five industries to broaden the state's economic base, create new wealth and generate quality jobs for North Dakotans. The industries supported by this entity are similar to the ones proposed in this business plan: Value-added agriculture, advanced manufacturing, technology- based business, tourism, and energy. The NO Department of Commerce also promotes The North Dakota Development Fund. This fund coordinates efforts between all sources of financing, the business and the community. Any project considered for this financing must be feasible and have a reasonable chance of succeeding. The fund provides \"gap financing\" through loans and equity investments not available from most conventional lenders and is available to any primary-sector business with the exception of production agriculture. The Development Fund also administers the Regional Rural Revolving Loan Fund, which provides funding for primary-sector projects located in a community of less than 8,000 in population or located more than five miles outside the city limits.

Today it is one of the Upper Midwest's largest business and trial law firms. Rain Source Capital Group (www.rainsourcecapital.com) RAIN Source Capital is a multi-state network of RAIN\u00ae funds that works with angel investors who are interested in supporting growing companies. RAIN Source\u00ae helps bring together like\u00ad minded angel investors to form individual RAIN funds and then provides these funds with a process for due diligence, legal templates, management support, access to deal flow syndication and other resources. RAIN funds share expertise, deals and experience between and among RAIN Source Capital's multi-state network to support growing companies throughout the area. RAIN Source Capital works with angel investors in Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and other areas. 5 Angel Investment Funds (4 in North Dakota, 1 in Minnesota) Valley Angel Investment Fund, LLC is a new venture capital fund that was formed in 2006 by accredited investors in and around the Grand Forks, NO trade area. The fund's objective is to provide both favorable investment returns to investors and to promote small business and economic development in the region. There are currently 5 angel funds in the region. The other four funds are located in Fargo, Bismarck, and Wahpeton, NO, and Fosston, MN. 12 All of the above entities will assist the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC in screening, generating, and promoting deals found in our region. Combined, these organizations have access to multiple potential candidates in multiple industries supported by this regional center. In addition, they strongly support this initiative and have already started to spread the word to potential candidates. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC doesn't foresee any problems in generating deal flow in its designated area. As an example, the Center for Innovation alone sees more than 100 business plans a year, of which many could potentially qualify for this program. The applicant is confident in the proposed Center's ability to generate deal flow. PROPOSEDINVESTMENTSTRUCTURE The UNO Center for Innovation Foundation is prepared to apply for a Regional Center designation status. This program will have a significant economic and social impact in the region. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to present a business structure that is slightly different than those presented by other Regional Centers currently in operation. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to act as a consulting vehicle, working as a liaison between local organizations interested in accessing EB-5 capital and foreign investors. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will have absolute control over administration of the Regional Center and will require investee companies to execute a contract providing for EB-5 program compliance. \u00b7 The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will have no ownership on deals promoted for investment. However, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will actively encourage communication and facilitation between the parties to ensure information is properly disseminated and all EB-5 investment requirements are fulfilled. Administration fees will be charged to both foreign investors and local business organizations (investees) to help offset operational costs incurred by staff and advisors during investment projects. These fees will cover items such as document preparation, legal expenses associated with managing investments, marketing expenses, traveling, finder fees, operating expenses and the li e. These administrative fees will not reduce the threshold minimum capital ($500,000 or $1 million) required for EB-5 eligibility. \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7' \u00b7 Regular documentation and reports will also be professionally compiled and disseminated to all parties involved in specific projects in order to ensure all requirements of an investment, both legal and financial, are being covered. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC, as a consultancy entity, will strive to ensure all information provided to its clients is professional and of high quality and will be responsible for reporting annually to USCIS on Regional Center activities. Foreign Investor- Deal Structure: The example below gives an example of what an investment promoted by the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC would look like in terms of time frame, structure, and fees: Example -Minimum investment required in this project is US$ 1 ,000,000. With each Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),10 new direct and indirect jobs will be created. Direct and indirect jobs will be measured by IMP LAN results. The total size of the project is , plus American investors. This combination of EB-5 and domestic funds will help meet the job creation requirement. There are available for foreign direct investment. Fees involved in the project per investment: Investment per unit: US$1 ,000,000 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) Project administration fees: per investment, independent of size and location. These fees will be used to partly cover operations costs incurred by the Regional Center as well as to cover \"finder's fees\" paid to individuals or groups bringing investors to the regional center. These fees are paid in addition to the EB-5 minimum capital required. Extra Attorney fees: Clients will also be advised and responsible for the extra legal immigration fees that will be incurred in the investment process. These fees can vary from US$ 10,000 to US$15,000 depending on the immigration law firm used in specific cases. The ND/NW\u00ad MN EB-5 RC will refer its clients to immigration legal firms that have a positive track record. It will be up to the investor and the referred immigration law firm to determine the final legal costs involved with the immigration process. Other legal fees related to structuring the investment deal, international accounting, international taxing structure, and others may also apply. Deal Sourcing Non-Refundable Fee: of the project administration fees are non-refundable -This fee will be collected to determine if potential foreign investors are serious. Administration fees will be collected once 1-526 is approved. Total cost of Investment per Unit: Below an investor time line is provided. These guidelines will be provided to investors to give direction related to our specific projects. Variations may occur depending on specific circumstances of each individual project. Investor Time Line: 14 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4)12. Specific case is filed and closed. Local Business Organizations -Deal Structure: The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will also provide consultancy services to local business organizations interested and able to participate in EB-5 projects promoted by this Regional Center. Local business organizations will engage the Regional Center for the purpose of: providing consultancy services related to securing private equity investment in the company; marketing the company to potential qualified international investors; identifying professional service providers necessary for attraction and completion of international investment. Local business organizations will be charged a consultancy fee per project in order to benefit from such services. This is a flat fee and has no relation to the total amount of foreign direct investment raised during specific projects. of this consultancy fee will be paid during the initial phase of a project and is non-refundable. will be paid once the investment has been completed, i.e., funds are released after 1-526 is approved. Fees will be collected to cover the amount of work that will take for the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC to attract potential foreigner investors. This consultancy fee cannot be covered using EB-5 investor funds raised during specific projects. Local business organizations will have to cover these expenses using a separate source of funds. Local business organizations will be informed of this fee structure before engaging the services of the ND/NW MN EB-5 RC. The ND/NW MN EB-5 RC will provide client service agreements to both investors and local companies (Appendix B) involved in this process. These documents will set expectations and delineate all services being provided during specific projects. The investment by the EB5 investor will be equity capital at a minimum of US $1,000,000 unless the company is principally doing business in a targeted employment area in which case it may be as low as US $500,000. The investment capital provide by the EB5 investor is not a loan; the investor will not be entitled to any guaranteed returns but may share in distributions of profits; the investor will not have a redemption right or any right to force the buy-out of his share at a particular price; the investor will be engaged in management of the company in some capacity; and the company will provide evidence of job creation using the IMPLAN-based methodology that is provided by the Foundation. Side by Side Investment Proposed Structure The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will work directly with 5 angel investment funds in North Dakota and Minnesota in order to identify potential deals and promote side-by-side investments between American and foreign direct investors. The Center for Innovation has helped form these investment funds and is currently supporting their operations and promotion. They are located in Grand Forks, Fargo, Wahpeton, and Bismarck, ND, and Fosston, MN. Additionally there are 5 other funds that we are in close contact with for syndication. Return on Investment -The ROI for foreign investors is expected within 5 to 10 years after investment are made. Past investments through RAIN Source Capital Group have an average of 1 OX per investments, including only American investors. This ROI average will be used to attract 15 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) potential investors, however the regional center will inform its clients that that information was used for marketing purposes, and that this is not a guarantee that investors will receive equal or similar ROI. Transparency -Progress documents and reports will be periodically provided to potential investors. They will also have access to deal reports and other information through a website - Angel Soft (www.angelsoft.net). All deals performed in this region are uploaded into this secure website so investors can closely monitor their investment. Quarterly updates will also be provided. The Center for Innovation has substantial experience related to managing investments acquired by founding and operating 5 angel investment groups in North Dakota and Minnesota. Similar managing and operations structures will be used to give investors and entrepreneurs clarity and security during the investment process. Summary: The example above is one of the many types of investments that the North Dakota/Northwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Center will be promoting. It also demonstrates how administration fees and consultancy fees will be applied to both foreign investors and local organizations during an EB-5 project. The regional center plans to evaluate the creation of new direct and indirect jobs by using economic multiplier models. IMP LAN will be the methodology used to prove job creation. Individual reports will be provided both to USCIS and investors to ensure all requirements are met thus allowing foreign investors to acquire Green Cards. The ND/NW-MN EB- 5 RC is excited to apply for a regional center designation in order to administer foreign direct investment into the US. The regional center will strive to provide high quality and professional services, and ensure all the requirements related to foreign direct investments are met, allowing . both local organizations and foreign investors to benefit from this program. SOURCE/ AMOUNT OF CAPITAL REGIONAL CENTER The Center for Innovation Foundation has initially allocated for the regional center application development phase. Most of the funds will be utilized to cover any legal fees plus analysis related to the application process. Also, one supporter of the regional center, the North Dakota Department of Commerce, has invested which will be used for marketing and startup purposes. The Foundation will provide additional funds for startup, operations, and will cover staff costs. The Center for Innovation Foundation resolution authorizing application for an EB- 5 Regional Center for North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota is found in Appendix D. The Center believes that this initial investment will be sufficient throughout the application process as most of this application has been compiled by Center for Innovation Foundation staff. Over 300 hours of staff time and multiple Center for Innovation resources have been utilized in order to complete this application. After designation is received, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to sustain its operation by collecting administration fees in order to have cash flow and to augment the Regional Center's budget structure. This operational structure will secure the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC's financial sustainability. Moreover, the UNO Center for Innovation Foundation will be responsible for identifying and raising any additional capital as required.

North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota would greatly benefit from foreign investment and new jobs. Despite the recent modest economic growth in our two-state region, several cities throughout North Dakota and part of Northwest Minnesota have experienced levels of unemployment we have not seen in decades. Several manufacturing firms have downsized or shut their doors in our area and the Grand Forks Air Force Base was significantly downsized in the last round of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC). Our rural economy has been stressed by outmigration, and an infusion ofnew For~ign Direct Investment under the EB-5 program and the resulting increase in jobs would greatly benefit our region. As the region faces economic hardships, it is imperative that the government and the private sector work together toward stimulating the local economy and bringing jobs to the unemployed and underemployed. Designating North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota as a \"Regional Center\" under the Immigration Investor Pilot Program is a great opportunity to stimulate our regional economy through investment in entrepreneurial ventures. I fully support UND Center for Innovation Foundation's efforts to establish an EB-5 Regional Center, and I look forward to working with you to make these efforts a reality. u EARL POMEROY Member of Congress PRINTED ON RECYCleo PAPER 43 KENT CONRAD NORTH DAKOTA websile: hllp:l/conrad.senate.gov COMMITIEES: BUDGET, CHAIRMAN AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY FINANCE INDIAN AFFAIRS Bruce Gjovig, CEO ilnitcd ~tares ~cnatc October 15, 2009 UND Center fo1\u00b7 Innovation Foundation 4200 James Ray Drive Grand Forks, NO 58203 1-800-223-4457 530 twn SENATE BISMARCK, 58501-3866 (701) 268-<1648 657 AVHiliE NORTH, ROOM 306 FARGO, NO 68102-4727 (701) 232.:ao~o 102 NORTH 4TH STREET, SUITE 104 GRAND FORKS; NO 68203-3738 > (701) 775-9601 100 1ST EB-5 Regional for North Dakota and No1\u00b7tbwest Mnnesotn Dear Mr. Gjovig: It is my pleasul'e to offer my strong support to the University of North Dakota (UND) Center for Innovation Foundation's effm1s to secure an EB-5 Regional Center designation for the State ofNorth Dakota and 20 counties in Northwest Minnesota. I understand the EB-5 Regional Center designation would be under the Inuuigrant Investor Pilot Program through the U.S. Immigration & Citizenship Services (USCIS). In recent months, several cities thl'oughout North Dakota and No1thwest Minnesota have experienced levels of unemployment not seen in decades. North Dakota's largest manufacturer has closed one of its production facilities and the Grand Forks Air Force Base was significantly downsized in the last round of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC). Our rural economy has been stressed by outmig\u00b7ation, and an infusion of new Foreign Direct Investment under the EB-5 program and the resulting increase in jobs would greatly benefit our region. Designating N011h Dakota and Nmthwest Minnesota as a \"Regional Center\" under the Inunigration Investor Pilot Program is a great opportunity to stimulate our regional economy tlU'ough investment in entrepreneurial ventures. Again, I am pleased to offer my strong suppo1t for the UND Center for l1movation Foundation's effmts to establish an EB-5 Regional Center. Please let me !mow if there is anything I can do to provide additional support to this effort. Sincerely, \u00b7kL) )KENTCONRAD . United States Senate 44 -Stateof-- N orth Dakota Office of the Governor JohnHoeven Governor Immigrant Investor Pilot Program US Dept of Homeland Security US Citizenship & Immigration Services Washington, DC 20528 October 9, 2009 As Governor of North Dakota, I support the UND Center for Innovation Foundation's efforts to secure an EB-5 Regional Center designation for the entire state of North Dakota and 20 counties in northwestern Minnesota under the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program through the U.S. Immigration & Citizenship Services (USICS). Our state would greatly benefit from foreign investment and new jobs from the EB-5 program. While North Dakota has experienced economic growth in the past t:Wo years, the manufacturing sector of our economy is feeling the effects of the national recession. The Grand Forks area llas also felt the effects of the recent the BRAC round as the Grand Forks Air Force Base lost its aerial refueling mission. The EB-5 program will help our state's entrepreneurs and economic developers secure the vital investment for employment growth. The UND Center for Innovation Foundation is well positioned to lead this effort as they have been working with entrepreneurs and angel investors successfully for 25 years. Through the \"Regional Center\" designation under the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program, an opportunity exists to allow the EB-5 Regional Center to foster investment in job-creating ventures in the state of North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota thus providing an economic stimulus to the entire region. This is a program ideal for rural states like North Dakota. We fully support UND Center for Innovation Foundation's efforts to establish an EB-5 Regional Center for the state of North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. 38:53:56 600 E Boulevard Economic Development & Finance Tourism Workforce Development October 27, 2009 Immigrant Investor Pilot Program US Department of Homeland Security US Citizenship & Immigration Services Washington,.DC 20528 Dear Sir/Madam: As Corrm:iissioner of the North Dakota Department of Commerce, I support the University of North Dakota (UND) Center for Innovation Foundation's application to secure an EB-5 Regional Center designation under the immigrant Investor Pilot Program through the U.S. Immigration & Citizenship Services. Our state and region has historically grown its business base through investments from within while typically being overlooked as a location for injecting capital by outside private investors \\ . . \u00b7. and investment groups. 'fhis is not due to a lack of quality investment opportunities, but rather, the result of an under-utilization of our natural and human resources and creativity that exists in the state ofNorth Dakota. With a resurgence of entrepreneurial activity, enhanced efforts to commercialize university research and the strategic delivery of aggressive business development programs within our region, we see tremendous opportunities to diversify and expand our economic base with resources that can be brought forth through an EB-5 Regional Center. An EB-5 Regional Center will provide us with the resources to generate new business development and growth through the attraction of investment dollars into North Dakota and Northwestern Minnesota. The North Dakota Department of Commerce strongly supports the UND Center for Innovation Foundation's efforts to establish an EB-5 Regional Center. Your approval of this application will result in positive benefits for the State of North Dakota, Northwestern Minnesota and the United States as a whole.

Despite the recent growth in our region, several cities throughout Northwest Minnesota and North Dakota have experienced some levels of unemployment never seen before. This is a rural area ofthe country that has been stressed for decades by outmigration and loss ofjobs. Foreign Direct Investment under the EB-5 program will help tum the tide of high and steady outmigration that has resulted in low population in rural areas. As the region faces economic hardships, it is imperative that local municipalities., counties, government, and the private sector work together toward stimulating the local economy and bringing jobs to the unemployed and attracting new businesses to locate in our region. It is my opinion that the USCIS objectives for the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program will be well met with the approval of this grant from the UNO Center for Innovation Foundation.

This milestone provides a good time to appreciate from where we have come, reflect on where we are, and project where we are going. Success stories involve vision and key strategies as well as leaders and stakeholders who make a vital difference. No person or entity climbs to the top alone and rarely without severe challenges and obstacles. The UND Center for Inno\u00ad vation is no different. Here are the key factors to our suc\u00ad cess since our launch in 1984. Tom Clifford, Patron Saint We were blessed to have the strong support of UND Presi\u00ad dent Tom Clifford in the formative years, lasting long after his retirement in 1992. He was an enthusiastic supporter when he allowed me to start one of the nation's first entrepreneur outreach centers. Tom wanted innovation on campus and he was willing to back an idea that totally foreign to a college campuses at that time. Most university administrators avoid risk and unknowns outside the laboratory, and only will do the already tried and true ... and well-funded. However, Clif\u00ad ford was an extraordinary leader who appreciated new opportunities, believed the future is often created by mavericks, and backed his campus innovators by helping to secure much needed funding. Clifford asked me to report directly to him to send a message to the nay\u00ad sayers, detractors and bureaucrats: the new Center enjoyed his blessing. With his exten\u00ad sive business knowledge, he was a positive advisor when asking for counsel, but he never interfered with operations. Clifford liked football, so I often said Tom blocked and tackled so that I could run. And he did. The Center would not have been started under most other college administrators who would be either nervous about innovation and change, or who did not see the value of entrepreneurship. I was so fortunate to launch the Center under a university leader who embraced innovation and entrepreneurship and provided good coun\u00ad sel and support when it was needed. I shall forever be indebted to this extraordinary leader -Tom Clifford who was a mentor and friend until the day he died this last February. Capitalism and Entrepreneurship I have a strong belief that capitalism -particularly entrepreneurship -is the best way for the poor and disadvantaged to raise their heads above the crowd, supported by a good education that provides know-how, skills and the ability to think on. your feet. I believe it is through entrepreneurship that the economy is fueled -creating more and broader oppor\u00ad tunity for home ownership, savings, retirement plans and their own companies i.e. wealth and security. I grew up in modest economic conditions on a small farm with no particular advantage other than my mind and a supportive family. I never felt that I should be taken care of, and thought nearly all people have the ability to take control of their own individual destinies. Entrepreneurship is how people can best realize their potential and be rewarded for their talents. So many started with so little, and attained so much through entrepre\u00ad neurship. The names on endowments, museums, foundations, and public buildings are populated by entrepreneurs who grew much from_little, and gave back to their communi\u00ad ties, universities, and the nation. I am immensely thankful to the American system of capitalism and the relative ease that people can start ventures and find their competitive advantage through innovation. Being an entrepreneur is not easy and there are many steep hills to climb, but at least not all the odds are stacked against the new and small. Entrepre\u00ad neur Centers should be in every state, nation and on nearly every college and university campus. It was our American system and values that allowed the Center for Innovation to be among the first entrepreneur centers in the world, figuring how to do more and be bet\u00ad ter. I feel lucky and blessed to have played a role in the establishment of UNO's Center for Innovation. -- \u00b7-.~ ..... - 54<--'- Business Builders, Benefactors, Investors and Mentors The idea to start the Center for Innovation came while work- ing with UNO alumni who were successful entrepreneurs. I was fascinated with these outstanding leaders who were innovators and business builders and who were strongly committed to the university and their respective communities. I thought it would be good to purposefully help young people become entrepre\u00ad neurs -our nation's future innovators, employers, leaders and benefactors. In 1984, entrepreneurs were universally ignored by economic developers, universities, chambers of commerce, government officials -nearly everyone. It is difficult to remem\u00ad ber in today's business environment that 25 years ago there was total lack of attention and priority given to entrepreneurs. Informed people now recognize that our world economy is highly dependent on a constant supply of new entrepreneurial leaders and innovation. When launching the Center for In\u00ad novation,J sensed that I could depend on successful entrepre\u00ad neurs to support future entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs remem\u00ad bered how lonely and difficult it was to start a new venture and wished better for the next generation. In 1984, Clifford provided the first $20,000 to launch the Center and cha.llenged me to raise funds from UNO alumni and entrepreneurial friends to operate the Center. Fifteen entrepreneurs stepped up to the plate the first year, with Walt Swingen of Grand Forks writing the very first check. When thanking Walt, I quoted a Chinese proverb: \"He who gives early gives twice\" i.e. leadership gifts matter greatly. He liked to tease me that quote meant he had the opportunity to give more than once, which he did as did many other benefactors. We are now approaching $30 M invested in our two tech incubators, endowments, program in\u00ad frastructure, and entrepreneur outreach. The Center exists be\u00ad cause successful entrepreneurs invested in the next generation of entrepreneurs. Without these benefactors we would still be in a storage closet in Harrington Hall hoping for crumbs. These successful entrepreneurs were vital advocates and advisors for the Center, mentors to emerging entrepreneurs, investors in ventures, and helped form a vibrant entrepreneur commu\u00ad nity. The key experts are the successful practitioners who know the art and science of launching and growing ventures. These practicing experts were vital in building our Center that became world-class and recognized with seven national awards. We are still learning from these entrepreneur experts. And, as always, we are so very grateful for their ongoing participation and stew\u00ad ardship. Center for Innovation Foundation When launching the Center, I was fortunate that an early leader in entrepreneurship education was a native of Ashley, North. Dakota. Dr. Dwight Baumann started teaching entrepreneur\u00ad ship classes at MIT in the late 1950s and launched an entre\u00ad preneur program at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1970s. He strongly advised that if the university did not supply the necessary funding for the Center, he said we should utilize a 501(c)3 foundation to attract funding and entrepreneur leaders, whom serve as catalysts for change and protect the funding from the bureaucracy. President Tom Clifford agreed. Dwight lectured often that the natural enemy of innovation and entre\u00ad preneurship is bureaucracy, and that universities wi_ll embrace innovation only with strong catalysts from outside and good leaders on the inside. He was so right. The Foundation has been instrumental in attracting great entrepreneur talent as trustees as well as benefactors to help build the Center and the :;\u00b7;\u00b7\u00b7-,\u00b7 academic entrepreneur program. The 25-year outcome would be quite less without the Foundation, and our future remains closely tied to the success of the Center for Innovation Founda\u00ad tion and its entrepreneur trustees. Entrepreneur benefactors are attracted to a foundation that has entrepreneur trustees to provide oversight and direction. Dean Dennis Elbert & the campus supporters I was a strong aqvocate for Dennis Elbert when he was being named Dean of the College of Business & Public Administration in 1997. He was an outstanding marketing professor, a strong student advocate, had extensive military and consulting experi\u00ad ence, had worked with entrepreneurs, and knew UND as he was a North Dakotan and graduate. When he was named Dean, the Center for Innovation found a good home in the College of Busi\u00ad ness. After many years of trying to get an entrepreneur major launched, we finally had receptive leadership. UNO's entrepre\u00ad neur experience is unusual in that most colleges have an entre\u00ad preneur outreach program grow out of the academic entrepre\u00ad neur department. It was the other way around at UNO, with the academic program growing out of the Center for Innovation in 1999. Within five short years we were ranked in the top 1% of entrepreneur programs nationally by Princeton Review be\u00ad coming a signature program for UNO. The Center enjoys strong support from Denny as well as many business faculty and other faculty across campus. It is not universal support, but we did have vital support from key faculty and administrators that has allowed us to excel nationally, even on a shoestring budget. We are blessed. On many campuses, entrepreneurship pro\u00ad grams have been starved, attacked, robbed, micro-managed by the unknowing -facing every obstacle one can imagine. Politics on a college campus can be brutal, especially for the newly successful. Dean Elbert has helped us avoid such pitfalls and setbacks for which we are truly thankful. I was pleasantly surprised when UNO announced their new branding statement in 2008: Creative~ Innovative~ Entrepreneurial ~Spirited. The campus culture has changed, embracing key principles and values of our organization. No finer compliment can be paid. Public Policy Leaders Entrepreneurs depend on a favorable business climate to increase their opportunities to succeed. From the very first year, I have advocated many tax, regulatory, legal, financing and other reforms and programs to improve North Dakota's entrepreneur business climate. I have been fortunate that US Senators and Congressmen, Governors, State Legislators and government administrators have responded so favourably. In \u00b7\u00b7:;;:-;\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 -.-. 55\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7-?-~- _r-, particular, I have teamed up with three leaders many times to innovate with public policy that has helped advance North Dakota as an entrepreneur-friendly state -Sen. Ray Holmberg of Grand Forks, Sen. Tony Grindberg of Fargo and Governor John Hoeven. These are great quarterbacks who will carry the ball all the way down the field. By embracing innovative policy ideas, North Dakota has programs like InnovateND, 45% investment tax credit for angel investors, the Beginning Entre\u00ad preneur Loan Program, tort reform for aircraft manufactures, $5M for growing the UAS mission at the Grand Forks Air Force Base, and many more initiatives too numerous to mention here. Special mention should be made of Sen. Kent Conrad who was a key advocate in 1992-93 to help the Center for Innovation Foundation secure a $3.5 M competitive grant from HUD to build the first campus incubator on the Great Plains, now called the Skalicky Tech Incubator. Our Foundation gave the incubator building to UND to secure the building's operational support at a time the Foundation was unsure it could secure those re\u00ad sources. It is never easy to secure funding for a new building, esp. when you are a young program with more opportunity and vision than track record and funding. We are fortunate to have these elected officials who understand and embrace innovation and entrepreneurship. North Dakota was an entrepreneur state from the time of the homesteaders and immigrants until the Great Depression, a period of SO years. We lost that entre\u00ad preneur culture for four decades after the depression, but it is coming back strong. Our best years are ahead of us thanks to innovative entrepreneurs who have a good entrepreneur busi\u00ad ness climate in which to launch and operate new businesses right here in North Dakota. Entrepreneurial Students The Center has continuously bootstrapped our operations, patching together the funds from many sources required to get the job done right. This is a constant stress and strain. Of- ten the only talent I could afford was student talent who were looking for an opportunity to prove themselves. Entrepreneur\u00ad minded students consistently out performed in quality and quantity those 'experts' hired from the corporate or academic spheres. So we built a world-class entrepreneur center with a large dose of student talent. Many predicted that it could not be done, as experience and credentials were premium. They were wrong. We built the Center on young talent and at a fraction of the cost of other university centers, esp. at big-name schools. I would put our students from North Dakota and Minnesota against experts, students or faculty from the Ivy League and the elite universities. Our students are bright, practical, hard \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7:\u00b7:-.,\u00b7 7 ~---\u00b7\u00b7.\u00b7 . \u00b7------------ -------- working young people who are immensely resourceful and creative in a way the rich kids could not be. I have a good eye for talent, and there is lots of talent here to choose from. If anyone doubts the wonderful talent of our student body, think of the incredible number of successful alumni from UND. That number keeps growing. Bart and Lynn Holaday provided a grant in 2006 to the Center for Innovation Foundation to start up the nation's first student-run venture fund -the Dakota Venture Group. This student group works at a very high level of expertise and ability, more than 15 to 20 years above their age and credentials. Just one more example where our students do compete with anyone from anywhere. Students helped build a world-class entrepreneur center, and in turn we give them ex\u00ad perience that they could not get anywhere else. That is a great win-win situation .. Entrepreneurial Talent Every great organization is built with great talent whose leader\u00ad ship, creativity and productivity are unleashed. As my com\u00ad ments above testify, I have been able to surround myself with student talent, and have worked with an amazing number of emerging entrepreneurs across the state with ideas, leader\u00ad ship, vision, and entrepreneur gumption. Their success reflects well on us, but they did the heavy lifting with innovation and new ventures. We were the coaches on the sideline urging them on as they were on the field competing. There are so many good people to recognize and appreciate; there is danger in mentioning some and not others. North Dakotans are cautious entrepreneurs and tend to underpromise and over deliver. Most shun bringing attention on themselves, and would rather do a very good job with no special notice. The challenge before us to is unleash the entrepreneur talent of so many more people. Good news is that entrepreneur talent is all over North Dakota, too often waiting to be empowered and encouraged. Help us unleash that talent. Two academic colleagues -Craig Silvernagel and Jeff Stamp -deserve special attention as they are the dedicated profes\u00ad sors who do superb work in the classroom that has resulted in our top academic rankings. The Center is the entrepreneur lab for our academic program. Our Foundation and Center have secured a good share of the necessary funding for professors, internships, programs, etc. investing in the future of young talent and great professors. Most serial entrepreneurs think about becoming an entrepreneur when quite young. Providing the knowledge and tools early will only accelerate success that our economy needs. These two professors provide the aca\u00ad demic rigor and they have dedicated their professional lives to our students and excellence in the classroom .. Every day I have evidence of their good work. When you see Craig and Jeff thank them. They are entrepreneur educators who are truly best-in\u00ad class. Staying on Top is Hard Work To remain a top-ranked and nationally recognized program is hard work. Our entrepreneurship program has been ranked in the top 1% of programs in the nation for five years. Entrepre\u00ad neurship has become a signature program for UND, bringing honor and recognition to our students, faculty, Center, Univer\u00ad sity and State. However, our competitors and colleagues do not slack off so we can stay ahead and coast. It is just the reverse: they copy success and work harder. I in 25 years to keep it state-of-the\u00ad art, and I am in process of doing it again enhancing our pro\u00ad grams and adding new dimensions. My early goals were to be among the best in the nation, and the best in rural America. I did not give a lot of thought during that time of growth to what it would take to stay on top. Electronics and plastics entrepre\u00ad neur Shelly Schjeldahl gave me a quote from Rudyard Kipling that helped sum up the need for innovative leadership, \"They. copied and copied but could not copy my mind, so I left them sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.\" With the help of our students, entrepreneur friends and benefactors, we will stay on top. Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Investment From the beginning the Center for Innovation was focused on innovation, entrepreneurship and investment- plus the pro\u00ad grams and infrastructure that support that focus. Innovation is what provides the competitive advantage. The focus has remained consistent for 25 years as we have developed several improved and new programs, new facilities, new infrastruc\u00ad ture, and better ways of supporting creative entrepreneurs. I have enough ideas it will take me a decade to find ways to implement them all. There are better ways to provide quality entrepreneur education that will reform entrepreneur educa\u00ad tion nationwide. It needs to be focused more on entrepreneur practitioners as professors, more leadership and entrepreneur experience for students, better integration of knowledge, be campus-wide and better engagement of students with emerg\u00ad ing entrepreneurs for win-win situations. There are opportuni\u00ad ties to turn on the entrepreneur spirit for middle-age folks who want a new challenge and focus in life. And there are more ways to engage potential angel investors in entrepreneur ven\u00ad tures. Stay tuned for more. Recessions provide opportunity, too What is behind us is not as important as what is ahead of us. There is so much opportunity to capture, and so many creative people who are waiting for someone to help them start their entrepreneur journey, even in hard times. Let us not regret lost opportunity -the hardest thing to measure in the world. The Center was born at the end of the 1980-83 world recession and after the malaise and stagflation of the 1970s. We have been through several North Dakota and national recessions in 25 years. In every market -up or down -there is opportunity for those who are looking, sometimes more opportunity in a down market. Dynamic change creates opportunity, and cre\u00ad ative destruction (thank you Joseph Schumpeter) helps us ad\u00ad vance with innovation and entrepreneurship. Out with the old and tired, and in with the new and innovative. I am alarmed that so many leaders have quickly forgotten the great lessons of entrepreneur capitalism in the current recession. Luckily creative entrepreneurs are paying more attention to potential customers than political leaders. Often I am discouraged when I see talent and opportunity wasted, but always optimistic and rejuvenated when I am around innovators and entrepreneurs. Our country has been through 37 recessions and depressions in 230 years, and from each cycle we came out stronger than before. The leading indicator in each recovery was innovation, entrepreneur and investment activity in the private sector. Our government and institutions learn slowly from experience in economic and business cycles. Luckily there are entrepreneurs -busy seeing what others do not see with a bias for action and opportunity. \u00b7There is lots of opportunity before us. Help every- . ---,-\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7 one you can find opportunity. The best resource man has is man himself, and we are everywhere. Unleash that resource. Finding your passion It did not occur to me growing up to become a social or campus entrepreneur, growing a non-profit to national prominence. I was around self-reliant Norwegian farmers near Crosby who were great problem solvers and practical thinkers, but I cannot think of any family or friends that I would identify as entre\u00ad preneurs. The entrepreneur gene was turned on when I was president of my fraternity learning leadership, and then asked by Delt alumni to help build a new chapter house on campus. At that time we started the first chapter educational founda\u00ad tion in the nation, proving the experts and naysayers wrong. I liked that. That process of innovation and pioneering helped me realize I liked the building and growth process, being creative. After four quick job changes in four industries, I found my passion and calling with the Center for Innovation a few years after graduation. I did not think I was the type that could do one thing for 25 years much less being an entrepreneur coach and pioneer in the entrepreneurship field. I underesti\u00ad mated the power of passion. What I wish for others is they find their passion too. It gives life such meaning and purpose. My mother died early when I was in college and my farmer father was never sure I could make a living as an entrepreneur coach in a university, but he was proud of my success anyway. Good fathers are like that, supporting your children's dreams even if it is to pioneer and not do the safe and secure. I have been blessed in so many ways, even during the tough times over this stretch of 25 years (which I will not talk about here). We learn from challenges and problems too, and as the Slavic's say, what does not kill us makes us stronger. I have dedicated my life to entrepreneurship and innovation with few regrets. There is nothing else I would rather do for a career than work with in\u00ad novators and entrepreneurs. I see lots more to do to advance the entrepreneur world.

SBIR!STTR is the single biggest source of seed funding in America, but it is very competitive with about 1 0% of the Phase I proposals being funded. It is a 2.5% small business set-aside to do competitive research to develop new technologies the agencies are interested in advancing. Check www.lnnovators.net to tap into the information on the program or check by topic area at www.zyn.com/sbir. Grant funding goes to ventures and entrepreneurs not invention or research. \u00b7 There is an expectation of commercialization (thus innovation, not invention) and 44% of SBIR awards are brought to market. Compare that to less than 2% of patents are commercialized or brought to market, so the risk is high. Investors are looking for viable ventures, not inventions. Of the funds raised for innovation, here are the most common sources from \"most likely\" to the \"most difficult\" to secure. 1. Personal savings 2. Credit cards 3. Sell assets (boats, hobbies, etc) 4. Second mortgage on home 5. Friends & Family -love money 6. Vendors, suppliers, other businesses 7. Commercial bank loans 8. Private investors or \"Angels\" 9. Government Grants 10. Venture capital Most new ventures secure their early capital from the first 5 categories. They purchase assets they need (machinery, equipment, supplies) and other startup costs from savings accounts, selling assets, loans, investments from close friends or family, and from funds drawn against the equity in the family home. Once launched, the new firm uses credit cards to cover cash flow while building an income stream from paying customers. This is the art of bootstrapping, i.e. doing more with less. Sometimes new ventures can go to a supplier, vendor or customer who has a good reason to see your venture succeed, and \"make a deal\" that helps cash flow. They might be willing to extend payment terms 30 to 90 days in return for your exclusive business, which buys you time on the front-end of your cash flow cycle before your customers pay you. Commercial banks \"renf' money only if they believe you can pay them back. Banks require collateral for 80% to 90% of the loan value. They like a solid business plan with a 2-year track record and a team leader with good credit. Sometimes an investor may \"lend\" you his good credit for an equity portion of your firm, i.e. co-signing for you on a loan. You secure a loan you would not otherwise get, and the investor gets equity while keeping his funds invested elsewhere. Private investors or \"angels\" are looking for early stage investment opportunities. Angels are found through referrals among business leaders and other successful entrepreneurs. They often invest in teams, and want a good return on investment like 25-40% or more. A solid business plan is 'a must' for this activity, as well as good investment agreements, valuations, and exit strategy. About 50,000 ventures are funded by angels each year investing over $25 Billion. Less than 3,500 companies receive venture capital. There are nine angel funds in North Dakota, and two more are emerging. For specific entrepreneur funding opportunities check www.lnnovators.net.

The employment methodology is based on the IMPLAN input-output model. The report provides an illustration of the employment methodology applied to possible investments that have features considered typical for businesses within the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. The report also provides an estimate of fiscal impacts and regional and national economic development. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC proposed in this report is designated for industries for which this region of the world has a comparative advantage based on the land and labor located here. Specifically, the industries were chosen because of either the resources located here, or the level and type of education and interest of the population. Resources include land and weather, particular crop types, and the design and development of specialized agricultural equipment from planting to final packaging. Often called \"the breadbasket of the world\", the Upper Great Plains is regarded as one of the most important food growing regions of the world. That is why the economic formula demonstrates that Giant Sunflower is a qualifying investment in agricultural production and the formula demonstrates why Amity Technology has developed as a world leader in applying technology to equipment for high value specialty crops. The application also inCludes computer based companies. These companies are located here both because of the value of the education in computers and because at least one university, the University of North Dakota, is consistently a top ranked Princeton Review entrepreneurial degree program. A company like Tri-State Aviation, Inc. appears because the education, skilled labor, and entrepreneurial spirit here has made it possible for a program like this to be successful in this region. That entrepreneurial spirit has meant that the University of North Dakota aviation program is considered one of the two top ranked aviation programs in post secondary education in the United States. Because of the ranking and reputation of the University of North Dakota's aviation program the school has been designated a Center of Excellence in Unmanned Aerial Systems. This designation and the University's proximity to the Grand Forks Air Force Base, which the United States Air Force has designated with a specific UAV development mission, means that northeastern North Dakota is considered one of the valuable resources to the future defense of the free world. The Unmanned Aerial Systems includes much more than the military mission. The university's aviation school includes a world leading space component researching questions of global warming and agricultural productivity, among other important scientific questions. Many of these original research projects have already reached commercialization, but significantly more research is now at the commercialization stage. Finally, the University of North Dakota College School of Medicine and Health Sciences is a world leader in rural health care. Ranking among the top schools in the United States in rural health, the University is ideally suited to working with international firms in the biotech industry. This industry is defined as being based on biology, agriculture, food science, and medicine. That definition is descriptive of North Dakota and Northwestern Minnesota in terms of its natural and human resources. Much of the important research that has already been accomplished in biotechnology has been done in this region. An example from private industry is Pracs Institute of Fargo, North Dakota, which also has a facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. Much of the company's research and education has been 1 done at both North Dakota State University in Fargo and the North Dakota State College of Science in Wahpeton. As North Dakota's leading agricultural college, NDSU has already played an important role in biotechnology research. It has worked with many worldwide leaders in biotechnology, particularly in development of seeds and crop protection products. This has lead to the development of important private/public partnerships in research and in commercializing important discoveries particularly in the areas of crops and livestock feeds. In the area of human biotechnology the important research has been in medicines. The leading company to this point has been Pracs Institute. At the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciencs, the Energy and Environmental Research Center, and the College of Engineering among others are also conducting research in biotechnology in diverse fields such as DNA, E. coli, and many others. It is the goal of the University of North Dakota and North Dakota State University as well as the entire North Dakota. University System to commercialize all research whenever possible. Many opportunities already exist, and many more opportunities are expected to be available in the near future. What has been lacking has been capital investment. In particular, it has been difficult to convince capital markets that this region is a good place for investment. The reputation of this area from the beginning of capitalism has been one of isolation. This area has been considered too far: too far from labor, too far from final markets, and too far from all the inputs except for certain raw materials. Today, with new products developed from new technology, those attitudes are no longer true, if they ever really were. On May 13, 2005 the Grand Forks Air Force Base was recommended for realignment by the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission. Although this decision prevents the base from being closed, it does result in a significant loss in personnel levels as well as a complete loss o fits current tanker mission. The Grand Forks AFB is the second most impacted base, losing a total of 2, 290 military and 355 civilian personnel moving out of the Greater Grand Forks region. The realignment reduces the population to approximately 1 ,600 uniformed personnel. When missiles and bombers were located at the GFAFB, it housed 14,000 uniformed individuals. This is a significant loss and impact on a multi-county region around the GFAFB. The GFAFB finds itself facing a series of significant challenges as it begins the transition from a super tanker wing to an unmanned aerial system (UAS) wing. With the recent cancellation of our nation's next generation tanker program, the GFAFB faces a significant economic \"bathrup\" effect where all the KC-135 tanker missions are pulled out of the base in 2008-2009 and the new UAS missions are bedded down started in late 2010 growing into 8 Global Hawks in the 2015-16 timeframe. The Air Force is planning to bed down a series of unmanned aerial systems/vehicles at GFAFB over the years including the Predator A (MQ-1) to be operated by the National Guard (the 119th Air Wing ) in Fargo ( UAS operator jobs there), and the Global Hawk (RQ-4) operated by the Air Combat Command. Additionally the Department of Homeland Defense (CBP Air and Marine Division) is operating two Predator B (MQ-9) models. The GFAFB will shape up to be a unique wing, with partners from DOD, Air National Guard and DHS to conduct UAS operations side-by-side in the future, but at a much reduced personnel level that previous operations. In the meantime the Grand Forks area did not experience a statistical increase in its unemployment rate because the Air Force personnel filling these positions were transferred to other areas in the United States. However, the area experienced the same economic impact that other areas realized when this reduction in jobs occurred in the civilian labor market. Nearly every area of North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota included in this Regional Center qualifies as a TEA due to its low population. This factor will help market the Regional Center and attract potential investors. TEA areas will be determined once investments are made within specific locations. In order to prove the validity of this area for various industries we have run investments using the 1M PLAN formula at $1 ,000,000. The results of these investments are as follows: 2 First, IMPLAN quantifies the annual economic contribution of a onetime investment on employment, output (sales), gross state product (GSP), and tax revenues. Second, the economic impact of direct investment in a firm is the sum of three components. Those are: the direct effect, the indirect effect and the induced effect. When a manufacturing firm increases production due to investment they need employees and materials, which is called I the direct effect. Because of the interdependence of the economy, changes in the economic activity in one sector will cause changes in other sectors as well. Increasing production at a manufacturing firm will require its suppliers and service providers to also increase production, which is the indirect effect. The increase in household spending caused by the increases in payroll from the additional hiring (direct and indirect) is referred to as the induced effect. Consequently the economic impact resulting from increased employment spreads throughout the economy impacting virtually all sectors of the state's economy. Finally, this report deals separately with those businesses located across North Dakota and those located within Northwest Minnesota. The IMPLAN formula was applied specifically to where the proposed investment is to be located. The analysis below examines the economic impact on the state of North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota from a $1,000,000 investment in capital (machines & equipment) in a particular firm/industry. Firms need capital and labor to produce output. For the purposes of this analysis we assume the increase in capital due to outside investment, will allow the firm to acquire the labor they need to increase output. The increase in output from the increase in capital will depend on the capital intensity of the particular industry. The annual impact of the increase in capital investment on employment, output (sales), gross state product (GSP), and tax revenues is shown below. In order to produce goods and services firms need inputs such as capital and labor. The typical production function is of the Cobb-Douglass formula: Y = AK113 L213 , where K and L represent capital and labor's contributions to output. The exponent on each represents the relative share of each input's contribution to output. At the aggregate level in the United States, 1/3 of output is due to capital and 2/3 is due to labor. For each of seven industries we consider the increase in output that is possible from an increase in the amount of available capital by $1,000,000. To do this we use industry level data, by NAICs code, to determine capital's share of output for each industry of interest. The data is from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis 2007 National Income and Product Accounts. Capital intensity is defined as the portion of the value added to GOP that is not contributed by labor: . 1 . . total value added -employee compensation zntenszty = ---------=---=----=---- total value added 3 (b) (4)The annual economic impact is estimated here using IMPLAN, a statistical software program that builds the predictive model for input-output analysis. We estimate the impact at the state level. The economic impact of direct investment in a firm is the sum of three components; the direct effect, the indirect effect and the induced effect. When a manufacturing firm increases production due to investment they need employees and materials, which is called the direct effect. Because of the interdependence of the economy, changes in the economic activity in one sector will ripple into other sectors as well. Increasing production at a manufacturing firm will require suppliers and service providers to also increase production, which is the indirect effect. Finally, the increase in household spending caused by the increases in payroll from the additional hiring (direct and indirect) is referred to as the induced effect. Thus the direct effects can be thought of as the stone that is tossed into the pond and the ripples generated by the stone's impact are analogous to the indirect and induced effects. The table below provides a summary of the total annual impact from a $1,000,000 investment in each of the indicated companies/industries and the corresponding impact on production. In the case of the Kilbourne group it is assumed that $1 ,000,000 is used to purchase capital for a restaurant. In the tables that follow we provide detailed information on the impact within various industries based on which company the investment is made. The industries are aggregated by 2 digit NAICS code for industries in North Dakota and 2 digits SIC codes for Minnesota. (This is due to differences in the data classification for each state. See attached Excel Files in Appendix A. All the tables indicate the impact on employment; output, total product (GSP), and taxes are included in this report. Furthermore, the tables break down the direct, indirect, and induced effects by the various industries. The results from applying the 1M PLAN formula to each company are: 1 Investments can be a combination of EB-5 and domestic funds. 4 (b) (4) (b) (4) The table above provides a summary of the total annual impact from a $1,000,000 investment in each of the indicated companies/industries. In the case of the Kilbourne Group it is assumed that $1,000,000 is used to develop retail space to be used as a restaurant at a cost of $300 per square foot. The restaurant is assumed to generate sales of $300 per square foot per year. The impact in the table above is associated with the restaurant's operation and is annual. A onetime impact would be associated with its construction and is indicated below. One Time Impact Associated with Kilbourne Construction2 Immediately below this report displays the 1M PLAN tables for two of the companies proposed for regional center classification in two different industries. These two organizations could possibly be participants as investee companies for the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. Each table is followed by a narrative explaining what the tables mean. First Company: Ntractive. First Table-Employment Impact: This table demonstrates that a $1,000,000 investment will result in a total increase in employment . Of that total are direct hires by the company. Their professional activity creates another in indirect or supporting industries. Finally, hires occur because of induced economic activity such as retail, educational employees, and so forth 2 The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC has provided th.is job creation analysis assuming that the USCIS would allow credit for construction related employment. 5 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4)6 (b) (4)I TAX IMPACT Ntractive Tax Impact 7 (b) (4)--------- \u00b7~------- Indirect US$1 ,000,000 Investment Employee Proprietary Household Enterprises Business Compensation Income Expenditures (Corps) Taxes Total 8 (b) (4) 9 (b) (4)10 (b) (4) 11 (b) (4)Remaining Companies Each of the remaining companies has generated similar tables when the 1M PLAN formula was applied to their investments. That is, IMPLAN will show how much the investment will increase all employment, all taxes, gross sales, and so forth. Those tables can be seen in Appendix A of this report. Summary: The industries selected for the regional center are those for which North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota have the greatest competitive advantage. For example, although the area has some of the necessary resources such as water, iron mills were not chosen because hauling the ore to the area would not be cost-effective. On the other hand, agribusiness is included because the region leads the nation in production of 14 major crops and in innovative development of agribusiness-related renewable energies. Given those factors, there is a high degree of probability that at the end of the Eb-5 Regional Center as many businesses or individuals would invest at least $1 ,000,000 each. That could lead to an increase in total output of over Sales would increase about and Gross State Product for both North Dakota and Minnesota would increase about Total tax collections in both states would increase about . Finally, we would expect job creation to total nearly new positions, a huge increase for this area. This report has been conjointly produced by Dr. Cullen Goenner and Mr. Ralph Kingsbury.

While we may have fared better than some over the past two years, our rural economy still faces unique economic challenges. Designating North pakqta.and Northwest Minnesota as an \"EB-5 Regional Center'' under the immigration. Irivestor Pilot' Program is a great opportunity to foster growth and jol;> creation in the seven i:O.dU:sfrY sectors outlined in their application. . ..

If this notice indicated we are notifying a U.S. Consulate about the approval for the purpose of visa issuance, and you or the person you filed for have questions about visa issuance, please contact the appropriate U.S. Consulate directly. APPROVAL OF AN IMMIGRANT PETITION. Approval of an immigrant petition does not convey any right or status. The approved petition simply establishes a basis upon which the person you filed for can apply for an immigrant or fiance( e) visa or for adjustment of status. A person is not guaranteed issuance of a visa or a grant of adjustment simply because this petition is approved. Those processes look at additional criteria. If this notice indicates we have approved the immigrant petition you filed, and have forwarded it to the Department of State Immigrant Visa Processing Center, that office will contact the person you filed the petition for directly with information about visa issuance. In addition to the information on the reverse of this notice, the instructions for the petition you filed provide additional information about processing after approval of the petition.

Q UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center /W0900 17 60 Page 2 .:. The Immigrant Investor Pilot Program (\"Pilot Program\") was created by Section 610 of Public Law l 02- 395 (October 6, 1992). This is different in certain ways from the basic EB-5 investor program. The Pilot Program began in accordance with a Congressional mandate aimed at stimulating economic activity and creating jobs for U.S. workers, while simultaneously affording eligible aliens the opportunity to become lawful permanent residents. Through this innovative program, foreign investors are encouraged to invest funds in an economic unit known as a \"Regional Center.\" A Regional Center is defined as any ec<;momic unit, public or prj_vate, engaged in the promotion of economic growth, improved regional productivity, job creation and increased domestic capital invesnnent. 8 CFR 204.6 (m) (3) describes specific evidence that must be submitted before consideration for eligibility for this benefit may proceed. After review of your proposal in the light of these requirements, the following information, evidence or clarification is needed to proceed. It is always best to start with a cover letter that acts as an executive summary followed by a table of contents of the various tabbed sections to follow. Mandatory Evidence for the Basic General Proposal Regional or National impact of the Regional Center (8 CFR 204.6 (m) (3) (iv) ): Regulations at 8 CFR 204.6(m)(3)(iv) require that the proposalcontain: ... a detailed prediction regarding the manner in which the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy in general as reflected by such factors as increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and without the regional center; Even though the proposal contains an Economic Impact Study by Investment, Output, Employment, Sales, and Taxes, a review of the proposal indicates that a detailed prediction has not been provided regarding the manner in which the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy with respect to increased household earnings. greater demand for business services. utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and without the regional center. Provide a detailed prediction, which includes the topics of regional or national impact on household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenan.ce and repair, and construction both within and outside the Regional Center. This can be combined with job creation and overall economic impact. Again, this impact statement relates to the Regional Center as a whole and it should address both the negative and positive impacts. ATTACHMENT TO I-797 UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center/W0900 17 60 Page 3 Economic Entity: Evidence has not been provided to show that the regional center is an economic entity. Provide evidence that the Regional Center qualifies as an economic entity. This evidence may include incorporation papers, partnership agreements or other documentation showing the regional center is an economic entity. Evidence or claim to future incorporation or other legal event is not sufficient. The regional center must currently be an economic unit and not a future economic unit. Indirect Job Creation (8 CFR 204.6(m)(3)(ii)): Under the provisions of the INA which apply to the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program and specific amendments to the statute, especially in the 2002 amendment Per Public Law 107-273, enacted November 2, 2002, which clearly states: A regional center shall have jurisdiction over a limited geographic area, which shall be described in the proposal and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones. The establishment of a regional center may be based on general predictions, contained in the proposal, concerning the kinds of commercial enterprises that will receive capital from aliens, the jobs that will be created directly or indirectly as a result of such capital investments and the other positive economic effects such capital investments will have. Also 8 CFR 204.6(m) (3) (ii) requires you to: Provide in verifiable detail how jobs will be created indirectly; It is imperative to fully explain indirect job creation, as well as the direct and induced jobs, if any. The requirement of creating at least 10 new full-time (3 5 hours per week) jobs per each individual alien investor mav be satisfied by shr:\"l\\iving that. as :>. r~s,Jlt of the invest~nent and the activities of the nev; enterprise, at least 10 jobs per alien investor will be created directly or indirectly through an employment creation multiplier effect. The econometric model described in the case is the IMPLAN Model. Although the proposal included an Economic Analysis for the seven industry clusters (Agribusiness, machinery manufacturing, aviation/ aerospace, information technologies/ communications, biotech/bioscience, construction and real estate development and utilities), a hypothetical investment plan for each industry project type was not submitted to show how an investment project will be capitalized and operated in a manner that will create 10 direct and indirect jobs or an actual investment plan for a specific proposed project. ATTACHMENT TO I-797 UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center /W0900 17 60 Page 4 For multiple industries a combination of hypothetical and actual plans may be submitted. The plan must clearly identify how the investor funds will flow to the job creating entity and how the jobs will be created. If your exemplar plans are based on an investment in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA), you must submit evidence that the proposed plan is located within a designated Targeted Employment Area. See below for details on documenting a TEA designation. Because the regional center potentially includes real estate development, details should be provided with respect how to the completion timeframe (in years and months) for each project to includ~ projected milestones and how direct job creation will be verified. Provide a description with supporting data of how, by the point of the I-829 filing stage, the underlying new direct jobs will be verified. Clearly specify the timeframes (by month and year) when and how the direct and indirect jobs will materialize for each regional center project. Also, provide the timeframe for completing each project, including project milestones and timelines for which direct job creation is based on and correlate these project milestone and timelines to direct and indirect job creation. When relying on econometric models for indirect job creation' it is imperative that \"direct jobs\" will be real identifiable jobs supported by wage reports or I-9 forms otherwise they must be explicitly identified as hypothetical in nature. Another method would be to predict jobs based on dollar amount invested in the overall project and this too must be made clear. This distinction will be critical at the I-829 removal of condition stage of the immigration process. Regional Center's Operational Plan (8 CFR 204.6(m) and 8 CFR 204.6): A review of the proposal indicates that a description of the plans to administer, oversee, and manage the proposed Regional Center was not provided. 1 US CIS does not accept or credit cre<ition of direct temporary \"construction jobs\" within a business pian or economic job creation forecasts activities which involve a limited duration construction phase of less than 3 years unless the scope, complexity, and the ongoing construction phase must be fully sustained for all the construction phase jobs for 3 years or more with respect to the size, scope, nature, engineering/technology challenges and breadth of the project--for example a massive-scale nuclear power facility, or major Dam or a giant oil refinery, or similar type of massive and expansive and major engineering project. Shorter term construction jobs less than three years in duration have been determined to be of such a short term in nature as to not be sustained and to decrease and disappear as the initial construction activities wind down to completion. Such shorter term construction jobs in many locations are seasonal at best. Nevertheless, for all capital investment expenditures for the construction phase, all capital-induced \"down-stream\" support activities and \"indirect\" jobs impacted and associated with the construction activities such as suppliers, transportation, engineering and architectural services, maintenance and repair services, interior design services, manufacturing of components and materials, etc., may be factored into the calculations for creation of indirect jobs. ATTACHMENT TO I-797 UND Center for Innovation Foundation Regional Center/W0900 17 60 Page 5 Administrative Oversight: The regulations at 8 CFR 204.6(m) ( 6), require that an approved Regional Center in order to maintain the validity of its approval and designation, must continue to meet the statutory requirements of the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program by serving the purpose of promoting economic growth, including increased export sales (where applicable), improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment. Therefore, in order for USCIS to determine whether an approved and designated Regional Center is in compliance with the above cited regulation, and in order to continue to operate as a USCIS approved and designated Regional Center, your administration, oversight, and management of your Regional Center shall be such as to monitor all investment activities under the sponsorship of your Regional Center and to maintain records, data and information on a quarterly basis in order to report to USCIS upon request the following year to date information for each Federal Fiscal Year2, commencing with the initial year as follows: o Submit a description of your plans to administer, oversee, and manage the proposed Regional Center, including but not limited to such things as to identify, assess and evaluate proposed immigrant investor projects and enterprises; how the proposed Regional Center would perform \"due diligence\" as to whether investment capital to be sought will consist solely of alien investor capital or a combination of alien investor capital and domestic capital; how to monitor all investment activities affiliated, through or under the sponsorship of the proposed Regional Center, and to maintain records, data and information on projects, investors, business activities, etc., in order to report to USCIS for each Federal Fiscal Year. This is known as \"due diligence\" and is coupled with \"oversight reporting responsibilities\" to be fully explained if approved and designated. Optional Evidence -- To be used by the commercial enterprise under the auspices of the Regional Center USCIS will review the documents listed below to determine if they are in compliance with EB-5 eligibility requirements. By providing these documents, the Regional Center may fac:ilitate the adjudication of relating I-526 petitions by identifying, up front, any issues that could pose problems at the Immigrant Investor Petition level. The business aspects of the commercial enterprise must be fully explained as to its structure. Provide the following documents as it relates to the regional center.

For the past year and half, the CIF has been studying the possibility of acquiring the status of a Regional Center in order to administrate and manage foreign direct investment though the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Regional Center Pilot Program. The principal identities in this project have worked together closely on entrepreneurial, international, and financial projects. They are Bruce Gjovig- CEO of CIF and Director of the Center for Innovation, Rodrigo Cintra --International Marketing Director/ Entrepreneur Consultant, and Tom Kenville- Rainmaker and V.P. of Development. In addition, these contacts will be responsible for promoting, processing and managing EB-5 international investments attracted by the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC. In addition, the ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will coordinate with multiple private and public entities in the states of North Dakota and Minnesota such as the government officials with North Dakota, the North Dakota Trade Office (NDTO), North Dakota Department of Commerce (NDDOC), Minnesota Economic Improvement Commission, and others. The ND/NW- MN EB-5 RC will be located at the Ina Mae Rude Entrepreneur Center, 4200 James Ray Drive, Grand Forks, ND 58203, which is owned and managed by the UNO Center for Innovation Foundation. The Foundation is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit that supports the Center for Innovation, a department of the University of North Dakota. The specific geographic area for this Regional Center includes the entire state of-North Dakota and 20 counties in Northwest Minnesota The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to focus on the following specific seven industries: Agribusiness Advanced Manufacturing Aviation/ Aerospace Information Technologies/ Communications Biotech I Bioscience Construction and Real Estate Development: Rural/Urban Renewal/ Multi-Mixed Use. Utilities (Electric Power Generation) The UNO Center for Innovation Foundation will work with private and public organizations in order to attract and screen potential commercial enterprises (projects) as well as immigrant investors interested in investing in this region. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC plans to act as a consulting vehicle, working as a liaison between local organizations interested in accessing EB-5 capital and immigrant investors. Administration fees will be charged to both foreign investors and regional business organizations (investees) to help offset operational costs incurred by UNO Center for Innovation staff and advisors during investment projects. The UNO Center for Innovation Foundation will hire the UNO Center for Innovation to administer and overview the ND/NW-MN EB- 5 RC's operations. Every project promote by this Regional Center will require investee companies as well as immigrant investors to execute legal contracts providing for EB-5 program compliance. The UNO Center for Innovation Foundation is delighted to provide addition information for a regional center designation in order to administer foreign direct investment into the US. The ND/NW-MN EB-5 RC will strive to provide high quality and professional services, and ensure all the requirements related to foreign direct investments are met, allowing both local organizations and foreign investors to benefit from this program. 1 ,.

The CIF RC designation covers the entire state of North Dakota, plus 20 counties Northwest Minnesota. Designated industries include aviation, agribusiness, IT/telecommunications, manufacturing, utilities, bioscience, and real estate. The Regional Center was developed to assist North Dakota and Northwest Minnesota companies in acquiring foreign capital through the USCIS EB-5 Regional Center investment pilot program. By utilizing the EB-5 Program North Dakota and Minnesota's companies will be able to expand their production and take advantage of market demand while avoiding many of the typical risks associated with expansion investment. Initial Promotional Phase: After receiving designation, the CIF RC focused primarily on educating and promoting the EB-5 program to local public and private organizations, while attracting potential projects at the same time. Examples of CIF RC's promotional efforts were: Performed multiple visits to local enterprises interested in the program Provided EB-5 related seminars both in ND and MN Promoted the EB-5 program at business events within our region Educated local economic development groups in both ND and MN about EB-5 and its benefits. Promoted EB-5 in Canada, Norway, Brazil, and China by attending international events. The program was well accepted in the business community and multiple potential projects were \u00b7 discovered during such efforts. The CIF RC plans to increase its marketing efforts in 2012 by performing more international outreach. . Ongoing Projects: Initial projects have been pre-qualified to participate in the program based on their location, industry cluster, and positive job creation. These companies are currently going through the process of developing additional supporting documentation which will be presented to accredited foreign investors. Projects working with CIF RC to secure EB-5 funding are: 1. Ultra Green, Devils Lake, ND (Ramsey County): Ultra Green is a privately-held company selling eco-friendly paper products made from wheat straw, bamboo, and sugarcane fibers, and bio-plastic products made from corn starch. Ultra Green intends to relocate its manufacturing facility from China to the Devils Lake region, where water, utilities, and material sources are more abundant and less expensive than in its current China location. Plans are to build a wheat straw pulp and molding plant hiring and expand production across the U.S. and Canada with in total initial investment, required from EB5 investment. Project is ongoing and PPM is currently being developed. Once the necessary material is ready, it will be presented to potential investors . 2. Staybridge Suites- -Extended Stay Hotel -Grand Forks, NO (Grand Forks, County) New commercial real estate development in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The construction phase of this project is expected to initiate in March 2012. Most of the funding requirements necessary to complete this project are already in place. This organization seeks EB-5 investment in order to close its fund raising. To operate this establishment, jobs will be created. 3. Homewood Suites &Conference Center- -Bismarck, NO (Burleigh, County) this project is being develop by Lextar Real Estate Services, an organization that has developed over $150 million of real estate in the Midwest, USA. Additionally, the company has developed over 3, 750 hotels in 84 countries. total investment in this project will come from EB-5, exactly . 1 .

Packet Digital-Fargo, NO (Cass County) This privately held company manufactures and markets power management integrated circuits which bring unprecedented power savings and battery life extension to electronic devices. Packet Digital's first product is designed into Intel's 2012 mainstream customer reference board for notebooks. Other companies currently collaborating with Packet Digital are HP, Dell, Samsung, and Qualcomm on applications for the company's technology and integrated circuits. The Company is raising in equity financing, expecting to EB-5 investments. 5. Sportsman's Lodge, Lake of the Woods, MN (Lake of the Woods County) Fishing resort located alongside the nation's fifth largest lake, Lake of the Woods, which is considered the Walleye Capital of the World. They operate yearlong, and provide services such as accommodations, meals, licenses, rods and reels, bait, tackle, fish cleaning, and tour guides. Their major markets are North Dakota, Minnesota, and Canada. The lodge is renewing its facilities and planning to secure EB-5 Investment through the CIF RC to complete this project. Potential Projects: In order to secure the sustainability of the CIF RC in the long run, a healthy flow of projects must be in place at all times. Thus the CIF RC continues to seek for additional projects interested in EB-5. Below are examples of potential projects interested in securing EB-5 investment through the CIF RC in RC Operations: Currently the CIF RC is funded by the Center for Innovation Foundation. At the moment one full time manager, a marketing director, and two part time employees are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the CIF RC. In addition, the CIF RC secured from the North Dakota Department of Commerce which was used to support our marketing and operational efforts in 2011. The CIF RC is in the process of applying for other federal and regional grants in order to further 2 ~ (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) e December-19-2011 develop the Regional Center and augment its professional management team. This management team will assist North Dakota and Minnesota companies in acquiring foreign capital and successfully executing the federally authorized USCIS EB-5 foreign investment program. In addition, with the assistance of several proven public and private professionals, many companies within our region would expand their production and take advantage of market demand while avoiding many of the typical risks associated with expansion investment. Additionally, the program enables further expansion after the typical 5-year foreign capital exit, where participation by private equity or local banks (debt conversion) will be secured, with proper upfront deal structuring. Expansion from trusted NO and MN companies who must bridge the capital gap in distressed and rural areas is the key to job growth. Reasons for Continued Support of the EB-5 Program in our region: 1. Companies require expansion capital. Given today's economy, still reeling from the financial credit crisis (particularly small businesses needing $2MM to $20MM in capital) we have significant demand for expansion projects among good companies in NO and MN with proven track records. 2. Demand from overseas investors is assumed strong, given the lower value dollar, low return on bonds, high commodity prices, high energy prices, need for safe financial haven in \"hard assets\", and desire for superior U.S. education for children. We have contacts with a trusted network of investors who need to be nurtured via travel funds and marketing materials/funds in order to gain confidence in our investment area. 3. Many community real estate projects could be completed faster in distressed flood areas should additional capital become available. These companies are clearly experiencing a seller's market due to high demand for rebuilt office space and community resources, and need to expand capacity, but lack capital given today's credit environment and current distressed environment. We are working with top-notch commercial real estate and hotel developers well known in their industry/our region to expand this area more quickly. 4. The program serves as a complement to current bank and private equity players, who desire conversion in the form of debt or private equity after the required 5-year at-risk EB-5 investments. This serves as a productive long term expansion play that will enable North Dakota and Minnesota rural and distressed area companies to rebuild, rehabilitate, and expand, in economic terms. The fact that the USC IS demands requires 10 jobs to be created per investor to obtain a green card, means exponential job growth in distressed and rural areas. Conclusion: Current credit and natural disaster limitations are denying and significantly delaying North Dakota and Minnesota companies significant revenue possibilities. Therefore, the CIF RC together with NO and MN State's manufacturers, economic development groups, and finance groups, would work together to expedite expansion projects and attract foreign EB-5 capital to overcome capacity constraints in our designated region. The project is a clear \"win-win\" for the economy, companies, service providers, and investors and their families. The program will also serve to promote cultural diversity, serve as a new model for EB-5 investment as a non-profit entity, and enable rural communities to rebuild. These business strategies will help North Dakota and Minnesota companies to avoid many of the risks commonly associated with acquiring capital for business expansions and provide a bridge to further expansion by coupling with side-by-side capital. 3 ~~ (b) (4)U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services California Service Center EB~5 201 ii';~=!;;.:!?iri M.t;ILED FROM ZlP CODE 58 20 3 fi i 111 it i 1 //111')1 111 I 1111 Business Records Search: North Dakot'Wiilicretary of State N . th D kota nd.goV.tcial Porta! for 0 r a i North Dakota State Govemment Page 1 of 1 ~~ l t -t Good Standing Original File Date: 08/20/1991 State of Origin: North Dakota Nature of Business (701) 777-3132 Effective EDUCATIONAL DATA-MANUFACTURING/ENTREPRENEURAL INDUSTR _Pri~.C::-~.~-=!1 Office 4200 ND 58202-6090 ... ~~gistered~g~~~ .....
