It's incredibly gentle and I find it a much deeper perspective than many meditation guides available online. Stephen mixes his knowledge of western psychology with his trainings as a Tibetan Buddhist monk in a way that is very accessible and meaningful. He offers a variety of methods that can be very helpful if you've struggled with meditation before. Speaking to the other review about the poor audio, I find the audio of the last year or so much better than it used to be and honestly with earbuds, it was never really an issue. Informative and relaxing This is a great podcast if you are interested in learning more about Tibetan Buddhist teachings. I love this podcast! Thank you for sharing your sangha and teachings. The guided meditation on dealing with anxiety is especially helpful. Panic Attack Savior I woke up 5am, I couldn't breathe and my chest was tight. My mind was racing and racing. I woke up mid-panic attack. After trying to self-sooth, I quickly searched \"panic attack meditation\" and the \"panic attack emergency\" episode showed up. Within that 20 minute episode I was able to get out of panic mode. This is the first time I've woken up in a panic attack and have never experienced anything like it. I am so grateful I found the episode I did and now I have a fantastic podcast to continue to help me grow spiritually and mentally. Thank you. "}
