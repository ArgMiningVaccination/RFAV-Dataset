ISMMS received initial five -year accreditation from MSCHE in 2010. The current reaccreditation process is the f irst since that initial accreditation. The Self -Study Report reflects the work of many faculty, staff and students over a period of nearly two years. ISMMS Dean Dennis Charney, MD assigned David Muller, MD, Dean for Medical Education and John Morrison, PhD, Dean for the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, to lead the Self -Study effort. Under their direction, a Steering Committee was assembled to develop a Self -Study Design that was approved by MSCHE Vice President Sean McKitrick, PhD in 2013. As required of candidates for first reaccreditation, ISMMS followed MSCHE's Comprehensive Self-Study Model. In accordance with the Self -Study Design, five Work Groups were formed to examine ISMMS compliance with thirteen MSCHE \"Standards of Excellence.\" (A fourte enth standard is not relevant for ISMMS.) The Work Groups reviewed voluminous materials, invited consultants in as needed, and deliberated extensively. Each group concluded with a report that was then folded into a single Self -Study Report. Periodically , the Steering Committee checked progress and offered suggestions. The draft Self -Study Report was posted on the ISMMS website for community input, and continues to be revised as additional feedback is received. The educational subcommittees of the Boar d of Trustees received status reports. Throughout the process, Dr. McKitrick has provided counsel and support. The Self -Study has provided an extraordinary opportunity for ISMMS to consider all aspects of its educational programs and the people and other resources that support those programs. Spirited, insightful Work Group and Steering Committee discussions served not only to identify areas in which the School excels, but also to raise questions on areas in which we might do better. Without doubt, the S elf-Study strengthened our sense of community and common purpose. The Self -Study Report demonstrates that ISMMS readily meets or exceeds every MSCHE standard. Major strengths and challenges identified through the self- examination process are highlighted below. Strengths ISMMS leverages its broad expertise in biomedical research, clinical care, and medical and scientific training to develop outstanding educational programs. ISMMS has a clearly defined system of governance with an active and committed Board of Trustees that supports all facets of the School's policy development and decision- making. The School's robust educational infrastructure, programs and services are continuously evaluated and improved through careful planning and resource allocation. 1 ISMMS employs rigorous financial budgeting and monitoring systems to ensure the availability of appropriate resources to support its educational programs and carry out its mission. The distinguished faculty at ISMMS are exceptionally qualified and dedic ated to providing world- class educational experiences for students. ISMMS has policies and procedures that are fully transparent and easily accessible to students, faculty and staff on the School's website. The School's educational offerings are regularly assessed to confirm achievement of expected student learning outcomes. ISMMS students have ample opportunities to provide input through a strong student governance structure, access to leadership and participation in strategic initiatives. The large and d iverse patient population served by the Mount Sinai Health System offers students new, unique and exciting training opportunities. Challenges ISMMS must maintain strong fiscal controls in a challenging economic environment to support and grow its cutting- edge educational programs. The rapid expansion of the ISMMS faculty resulting from the creation of the Mount Sinai Health System requires new approaches for mentoring, career development, inclusion and communication, as well as methods for evaluating succe ss in these areas. The successful pursuit of philanthropic support for educational scholarships and student debt relief will continue to be vital in attracting the finest candidates. Implementing appropriate, effective assessment methods for new degree- granting programs, particularly those delivered through a distance education format, will be critical. ISMMS must consider whether dual-degree programs would benefit from incremental assessment measures to capture unique learning outcomes. The School's commitment to build a significantly enhanced website will require enormous stakeholder effort to ensure that the final product is easily navigable and effectively serves its many constituencies. In summary, the 2013-2014 Self-Study conducted by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai affirms our collective accomplishments in providing an outstanding educational experience for our students and fulfilling our mission in all arenas. 2 Introduction Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) is a local, national and international leader in education, research and clinical care. A culture of innovation and discovery combined with tremendous individual and collective drive contribute to outstanding programs and a stimulating, energized environment. ISMMS is ranked among the nation's top twenty medical schools by U.S. News and World Reports. Our position as #17 in NIH funding among U.S. medical schools is a testament to our vibrant, cutting edge research program. The School's highly competitive educational programs attract an intelligent and diverse complement of students who are well prepared to undertake our rigorous curricula. In total, 1,060 students are currently enrolled in ISMMS degree-granting programs, which include: MD Degree -- Our renowned medical education program trains future physicians. PhD Degrees - The ISMMS Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences offers PhD degrees in biomedical sciences and in neuroscience. Master's Degr ees - Master's level programs focus on biomedical sciences, clinical research, public health, genetic counseling, and health care delivery. Students can earn dual degrees, e.g., our prestigious Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) confers joint MD and PhD degrees. There are also many options for cross registration beyond one's own program. In addition to the degree-granting programs, ISMMS offers postdoctoral research training to new scientists, graduate medical education training to new physicians, and continuing medical education programs for established physicians. The degree-granting programs are the major focus of this Self- Study. ISMMS has a robust infrastructure to support its educational programs. A strong financial base allows for excellent facilities, a large teaching faculty, and a broad range of student services. Extensive planning and assessment mechanisms are employed to optimize the allocation and use of these resources, thus ensuring fulfillment of the School's mission and maintenance of a firm foundation for continued growth and success. ISMMS was established in 1963 under a charter from the New York State Department of Education, and accepted its first students in 1968. Initially the School was affiliated with the City Universi ty of New York and in 1998 transitioned to an affiliation with New York University. Approximately five years ago the ISMMS Board of Trustees, Chief Executive Officer and Dean determined that the School's continued success would be enhanced by disengaging from its university affiliation and establishing our status as a free -standing medical school. In 2010 ISMMS gained approval from the New York State Board of Regents and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) to move forward as an independent school. Throughout its history ISSMS has maintained a close partnership with the highly acclaimed Mount Sinai Hospital, and together these two institutions were known for decades as the Mount 3 Sinai Medical Center. In 2013, the Mount Sinai Medical Center combined with Continuum Health Partners to create the Mount Sinai Health System, which is comprised of seven member hospitals and a single medical school, ISMMS. The School has retained its authority to conduct its own educational programs and operations, and to make decisions that are best for the School and allow it to fulfill its mission. Further, the School retains its own resources (e.g., employees, facilities, budgets, etc.) that are required for the conduct of business. The new corporate structure was memorialized through a charter amendment granted by the New York State Board of Regents, and was approved by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education through the Substantive Change review process. The exciting opportunities created for ISMMS and its students through the establishment of the Mount Sinai Health System are addressed in the Self-Study. The 2014-2015 Self-Study marks our first application for reaccreditation since ISMMS received initial institutional accreditation from MSC HE in 2010. The current Self- Study adheres to all requirements set forth by MSCHE, and uses the Comprehensive Self-Study model to demonstrate that ISMMS continues to meet or exceed all Standards of Excellence set forth by the Commission. The organizati on of the Self-Study included: Steering Committee - David Muller, MD, Dean for Medical Education and John Morrison, PhD, Dean for Basic Sciences and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, were appointed by ISMMS Dean Dennis Charney to serve as Steeri ng Committee Co -Chairs. Faculty and administrators representing the MD Program, the Graduate School, the academic departments and infrastructure offices were appointed to the Steering Committee for their breadth of perspectives and experience. Dean Charn ey charged the Committee with conducting a comprehensive Self-Study consistent with MSCHE expectations. The Self -Study Design prepared by the Steering Committee was approved by MSCHE liaison Sean McKitrick, PhD in March 2013. Consistent with the Design, five Work Groups were created and charged by the Steering Committee to review compliance with MSCHE standards. Steering Committee members assembled the Self -Study Report as described in the Work Products section below, and the entire Committee vetted the final product. The Committee is coordinating both the Preliminary Chair Site Visit (January 2015) and the Team Visit (June 2015). Work Groups - Deans Morrison and Muller appointed Work Group Chairs -- often Department Chairs or Institute Directors -- b ased on relevant experience and knowledge. They also appointed an administrative Co-Chair to each Work Group to shepherd the meetings and work products along. Additional Work Group members were faculty, students and staff selected to ensure appropriate constituencies to contribute perspectives and expertise to address the standards thoroughly. The Work Group Chairs received voluminous information from the Steering Committee to assist in their deliberations, and were encouraged to collect additional information as needed. Work Groups were also free to invite faculty, staff or student \"consultants\" on an ad hoc 4 basis to address specific issues requiring supplemental input. Report preparation was an iterative process involving much discussion, writing and re-writing. Each Work Group report was reviewed by members of the Steering Committee to confirm that all standards had been sufficiently addressed and to confirm the value of proposed appendices as supporting documents. The Committee then melded the various Work Group reports into a final report that flows clearly and logically, adheres to a uniform format, and addresses all standards. Community Input - The draft Self -Study Report was posted on the School website for input from the entire ISMMS communi ty. Self -Study progress reports and announcements of the draft report posting were provided at numerous large and small meetings, and feedback was encouraged. Board of Trustees Approval - The preliminary conclusions of the Self- Study Report were presented to the ISMMS Board of Trustees in December 2014. The final Self-Study Report will be submitted to the Board for endorsement in the Spring of 2015. The following sections of the Self-Study Report address the many ways in which ISMMS meets or exceeds every MSCHE Standard of Excellence. Both achievements and challenges are identified and analyzed. Discussion of each Standard includes an appended grid pointing to various sections of the Self- Study report that address the Fundamental Elements relating to th at Standard. We are proud to provide information and commentary about the invigorating environment and superb educational experience that ISMMS offers to its students, preparing them for successful careers in biomedicine. 5 Standard 1: Mission and Goals The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) has a clearly defined and broadly promulgated mission, with goals and objectives that flow directly from that mission. The ISMMS mission statement (Appendix 1-A), approved by the Board of Trustees, expresses our commitment to learning, discovery and clinical care. It is posted in the Faculty Handbook and is easily accessible on the mssm.edu website. The mission is the driving force for all activities in the School, and underlies our ability to provide outstanding educational experiences for our students. The components of the mission are closely intertwined - conducting ground- breaking research, offering excellent care to patients, emphasizing scholarship, committing to serve the needs of the community and providing a satisfying workplace together translate into creatin g a superb environment in which our students can learn and thrive. Appendix 1- B briefly addresses fulfillment of each of the six components of our mission. The Self -Study has served as an opportunity to consider changes to the mission statement, a topic that had been raised previously but not pursued. Review of the current ISMMS statement triggered curiosity about the mission statements of other educational institutions and even corporations. The trend towards tightly worded statements is perceived as attractive, for such statements tend to be targeted and easy for all to remember, respect and follow. Based on the initial investigation and discussion, a small group of faculty- administrators within the medical education program developed an initial draf t of a new mission statement; the Mission and Governance Work Group reviewed this draft and recommended some changes. Revising the mission statement will require broad input from the ISMMS community, with many layers of discussion and approval. Some of the groups that will be involved will include the Deans, Student Council, Faculty Council and Chairs and Directors; we will post the draft on our website to facilitate feedback from all constituencies. A final version will be brought to the Board of Tru stees for approval. We anticipate that a revised mission statement will not differ in spirit from the current version; our commitment to education, clinical care, research, scholarship and community are unquestioned, for they are the essence of the School's identity. The initial consensus is that an updated mission statement would bring value by clearly and succinctly expressing the School's purpose and direction. We will strive for a broadly inclusive effort that will result in a mission statement tha t is easily accessible and eminently reflective of the School. The ISMMS mission statement is complemented by statements of purpose developed by some programs within the School. These statements, which are always consistent with the overarching School mission statement, lend additional strength and direction to specific programs. For example, the MD program promulgates a mission to \"to produce physicians and scientists who are prepared to enter society as informed advocates and activists, able to advance clinical care and science, and capable of promoting change;\" this statement is highly compatible with the School statement, but focuses specifically on the MD program and underscores its particular focus. Sometimes, as is the case with the MD program, the focused statement works in tandem with a set of guiding principles that enumerate program goals. 6 The School's mission statement provides an overarching context for its activities. It is incumbent upon our leaders to develop goals that are consistent with the mission. The ISMMS Dean has promulgated an institutional theme of innovation and discovery that permeates all components of the mission and is reflected in all programs. Goals change over time in response to internal and external forces, and the School seeks to be nimble in recognizing and embracing change in order to ensure continued maximal achievement. As determined by particular circumstances, appropriate constituencies are drawn in. As described in Standards 4, the ISMMS Dean provides overall leadership in these efforts, but relies heavily on his deans, department chairs and institute directors to ensure that we stay abreast of the changing environment and needs and respond accordingly; proactive approaches are encouraged so that whenever possible we can anticipate, reflect and adjust in ways that maximally serve the needs of the School and its community. The Board of Trustees (Standard 5) is involved in major changes requiring its input and approval. The School's mission is inextricably linked to goal development, planning, resource allocation and assessment. Standard 2 of this Self-Study report describes the strategic, shorter term and local planning efforts that uniformly take mission into consideration. Similarly, Standard 7, organized to a large degree by the different components of our mission, describes the extensive metrics that the ISMMS leaders use to evaluate success in meeting all components of the mission; these assessments in turn influence decision-making, planning and resource distribution. Virtually everything - from educational program development to scholarly achievements by students and faculty to space assignments - involve these interconnected processes, and ensure that we fulfill our mission and attain our goals. A t all times, we strive to move forward in an environment that is equitable, respectful and transparent (see Standard 6). Communication plays an important role in making all constituencies aware of the School's mission and goals as well as their attendant expectations. The mission statement is posted on the ISMMS website for easy access. The ISMMS Dean delivers a State of the School address each year at Convocation in which he summarizes accomplishments to date and also outlines challenges that lie ahead. The Dean teams up with the Health System CEO once or twice annually to host Town Hall meetings in which they update the audience on the School and Health System, answer questions and exchange ideas. Frequent blast emails from the Dean of the School and the education and research Deans also help apprise the School community of issues of importance. Frequent and timely communications remind and inform all constituencies of goals and objectives as well as accomplishments and challenges relating to our mis sion. In summary, the ISMMS Mission Statement provides essential definition for the activities and purpose of the School. It is the driver for goal development that ensures our success as a premier educational institution and a world class leader in research and clinical care, all in an environment that strives to be both scholarly and compassionate. By interweaving the School mission with our planning, resource allocation and assessment processes, we create an environment of excellence and productivity that will serves us well now and will carry us well into the future. Appendix 1-C points to some of the sections of the Self-Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to mission and goals. 7 Standard 2: Planning, Resource Allocation, and Institutional Renewal Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) takes a methodical, practical and productive approach to developing programs and services, distributing resources and assessing outcomes in order to ensure maxi mal attainment of its mission and goals. Planning at all levels - from a Strategic Plan that guides the overall directions of the School, to localized and shorter- range planning by departments and programs - are complementary and steer resource allocation decisions. Institutional assessment in turn provides ongoing confirmation of the effectiveness of these plans and of mission and goal fulfillment. Together, careful planning, resource allocation and performance assessment are central drivers for the Sch ool's success. Appendix 2- A highlights some key sections of the Self- Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Standard 2. The Dean is responsible overall for directing and overseeing ISMMS planning, resource allocation , institutional renewal and performance assessment (Standard 7). In turn, a cadre of deans, chairs and directors (Standard 5) are held accountable - through routine informal feedback and a formal annual performance evaluation - for carrying out robust planning and assessment activities that drive sound resource allocation decisions and promote institutional health. Frequent meetings within and across management levels, and in settings ranging from large group meetings to intimate 1:1 encounters, are an essential component of communicating,, collaborating, and moving forward together. Examples include: monthly meetings of the Dean with his academic department leaders, alternating clinical and research chairs and occasionally convening all for a single m eeting; weekly group meetings of the ISMMS Dean with all Deans and select Senior Associate Deans; and Deans' meetings with the Faculty Council and the Student Council. Such meetings solicit input from many constituencies, encourage exchange of ideas and ensure that goals and expectations are widely known. Some, such as the Dean- Chair meetings, provide a forum for formal votes on major policy decisions affecting the school. The face-to-face meetings that facilitate planning and decision -making are complem ented by frequent broadcast e- mails. Publications such as the recently issued \"Defining Creativity,\" disseminate information of School directions and goals. Some departments and institutes also publish their own newsletters, annually or at other intervals, showcasing the achievements resulting from their careful planning efforts. A 10 -year Strategic Plan implemented by the School in 2005 -2006 has provided a roadmap for growth and success. That plan was developed under the direction of the Dean of the School, with over 100 faculty, administrators and Trustees working collaboratively to compile recommendations that were subsequently reviewed and refined by a senior leadership team and ultimately approved by our Board of Trustees. The Strategic Plan addres ses the three main components of the ISMMS mission - education, research and clinical care - and provides direction for each. It emphasizes translational medicine and research that will facilitate the application, or translation, of laboratory bench discoveries to patient care improvements. The Strategic Plan is a living document that is amended to accommodate both internal and external circumstances. Institutional performance assessments are integral to shaping the evolution of the plan. For example, the original complement of multidisciplinary institutes envisioned in the Plan has now grown to 22 in the face of internal assessment of strengths and 8 weaknesses coupled with changes in the biomedical environment that could not have been anticipated in 2006. A striking case is the ascendancy of big data as a tool for unlocking the mysteries of science; leadership analysis of the rapid growth in scientific computing capabilities led to the recruitment in 2011 of a leading international genomics expert and the establishment of an Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology. In three short years, this Institute has injected enormous momentum in furthering our institutional mission, as manifested by collaborative research projects, incorporation of genomics into the educational curriculum and application to clinical diagnosis and treatment. Similarly, the recently established Global Health Institute recognizes the rapid expansion of the School's expertise in and commitment to global health and related issues, in tandem with growing international need for medical education, clinical care and scientific knowledge; the interest among Mount Sinai students and faculty is quite high, with over 50 students and 40 residents engaging in international public health an d research projects to over 20 countries in a single year. Strategic planning relating to the educational, research and clinical care components of the mission is described below, and is followed by summaries of resource-related planning efforts. Educat ional Strategic Planning Ongoing planning and assessment are integral to all of our educational programs. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Strategic Planning In 2014, under the direction of the ISMMS Dean and the Dean for the Graduate School, development of a five- year strategic plan was undertaken. The objective is to analyze all facets of the PhD program, including core curriculum, qualifying exams, internships and options for thesis projects. A series of steps have been identified for the strategic planning process: External Advisory Board Review and Comprehensive Critique - In June 2014, an External Advisory Board (EAB) comprised of four preeminent scientists and educators visited ISMMS for several days to evaluate the PhD and MD/PhD program s from every perspective: quality of programs; faculty and leadership; alignment of Dean Charney's vision for groundbreaking translational research with Graduate School programs; and opportunities for growth. The EAB's report was highly laudatory of the G raduate School and also offered compelling recommendations for the future. It paved the way for the following phases in the planning process. Brainstorming - Broad discussions with all stakeholders, including faculty, students and administrators. The obj ective is to generate new ideas with an open mind that all perspectives are welcome. Consideration will be given not only to the internal ISMMS environment but also to external forces, using such resources as the highly regarded 2012 report by the NIH Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group, and an influential 2014 article in the journal PNAS about preparing biomedical graduate students for entry to the professional world. Review and \"Mapping\" of Ideas from Brainstorming Sessions - This process will f orm the basis for the strategic plan. Implementation - Launch is targeted for Fall 2015. 9 Among the challenges to be considered will be increasing graduate student exposure to human biology, clinical problems, and companies that turn biomedical discoveries into innovative solutions; incorporating some of the principles of educating engineers (e.g., problem solving and design) into PhD training areas; creating customized curricular offerings and thesis work opportunities to serve a more diverse group of incoming students, particularly students with backgrounds outside of biology; developing courses and experiences for the MD/PhD students that facilitate their unique training as physician -scientists throughout their training for both degrees. The entire planning process is designed to apply introspection, discussion and creative thinking to the development of a curriculum and an environment that will train students to apply innovative approaches to scientific discovery and translation in an effort to improve human health in the 21 st Century. The development of the new Master of Health Care Delivery Leadership (MSHCDL) degree program, which enrolled its first cohort of students in Fall 2014, is another example of the robust planning efforts of the Graduate School. This is the School's first (and currently only) distance learning degree program and was a logical outgrowth of many of the programs and health care delivery activities that were already established at ISMMS. Planning of the program commenced upon confirmation that its concept and goals were consistent with the School's mission. As part of this planning process, the School engaged a leading market research firm with expertise in higher education to conduct a competitive market and dema nd assessment of existing graduate degree programs - with and without a distance learning component - geared toward developing the next generation of health care leaders. The results of this assessment demonstrated significant demand for such a program an d confirmed that ISMMS was well-positioned to offer this degree program considering its broad experience in the relevant subject matters, including health care reform policy, health economics, and population health. After Kenneth L. Davis, MD, President and CEO of the Mount Sinai Health System, and Dean Charney endorsed the creation of the new degree program, a core leadership team used the details of the market research as part of the planning process for launching the program. The MSHCDL program is discussed in more detail under Standards 11, 13 and 14. The Graduate School is also developing a Master of Biomedical Informatics degree program. This program would be wholly consistent with the School's mission and Strategic Plan, and would expand and lever age its significant research programs and clinical expertise in biomedical sciences and data analytics to improve patient care. The program would seek to train a new generation of professionals who are skilled in both informatics and biomedical sciences. The due diligence process for this program has included: (1) examining open positions nationwide requiring Master's -level informatics expertise in the biological sciences and medical fields; (2) investigating enrollment rates at comparable programs throu ghout the country; (3) conducting a literature review on the demand for these skills; and (4) interviewing senior health service administrators and researchers at Mount Sinai, other academic medical centers and in industry about the demand for such skills. These activities confirmed that the proposed degree program in biomedical informatics would be complementary to other programs in the New York metropolitan area and would both attract and bring value to students across academic medicine and industry. A faculty advisory committee was formed to design the program, identify its key objectives and explore potential partnerships with other academic institutions and industry that 10 would enhance the experience of students. The advisory committee consulted with additional faculty across disciplines to continue refining the program development plan and to confirm that many existing courses could effectively integrate the biomedical informatics students. A faculty steering committee consisting of experts in biomed ical research and clinical informatics was updated regularly and provided invaluable feedback throughout planning process. MD Program Strategic Planning Under the direction of the Dean for Medical Education, the MD program routinely and consistently conducts careful, thoughtful and inclusive planning efforts. Of particular note is the year-long planning effort that resulted in major revisions to the curriculum. This process commenced with the creation of a Curriculum Design Team comprised of School leaders, faculty, students and staff (Appendix 2-B) which met biweekly beginning in January 2012. The team conducted a comprehensive, in-depth review of: The existing MD program curriculum (evaluation data, course director interviews, data from AAMC Graduati on Questionnaire and ISMMS graduation survey) Curricular changes made by the School based on educational value and quality Student outcomes (national board scores, residency match, GQ comparisons with schools nationwide) National guidelines and standards Accreditation mandates Presentations by leaders and experts in research, innovation, education (attached list) Curricula of top 20 medical schools Best practices in the field from leading Medical Education journals Literature from residency program direct ors The committee reflected upon our MD program mission ( to produce physicians and scientists who are prepared to enter society as informed advocates and activists, able to advance clinical care and science, and capable of promoting change) and also participated in a formal process to develop guiding principles to provide a framework for educational activities. The team used these and graduation competencies to engage in team -based interactive discussions to build the new curriculum. The outcome of this extensive planning effort was the launch of a revised curriculum in August 2013 that solidly positions the School to provide an educational experience that gives MD students the knowledge base, analytical skills, clinical skills, understanding of and appreciation for scientific research, and passion for learning that will prepare them well for practicing medicine and conducting biomedical research in the 21 st century. The new curriculum is described more fully in Standard 11. Research Strategic Planning The translational research thrust of the School's Strategic Plan continues to be critical and serves as an essential roadmap for ISMMS scientific directions. Current initiatives include targeted investments that will expand our translational abilities and support our mission to conduct groundbreaking research. These initiatives include: 11 Experimental Therapeutics Institute, including recruitments and capital investments in chemistry, screening, proteomics, an d monoclonal antibodies Novel technologies for therapeutic discovery- gene/cell therapies, vaccines Systems Biomedicine Molecular and Genetic Diagnostics, including testing lab in Connecticut Device development Novel digital applications to healthcare High Performance Computing and Big Data analytics Population Health Global Health Faculty, staff and administrators at all levels are involved in carrying out the work that is generated by these investments. Clinical Strategic Planning With an overarching c ommitment to providing the highest quality clinical care and bringing breakthrough scientific discoveries into the patient care realm, the clinical component of the School's Strategic Plan focuses on organizing faculty to provide excellent care, to be productive and to be fiscally responsible. Towards this end, Mount Sinai Doctors Faculty Practice has devoted enormous resources in developing reporting systems that measure faculty performance across these key metrics (Standard 7). The introduction of elect ronic medical records, clinical data monitoring systems, a centralized billing office and online appointment scheduling have contributed substantially to these efforts. The creation of the Mount Sinai Health System (Standard 4) and the associated addition of many clinical faculty introduces new challenges for ISMMS. Planning for the integration of these physicians into Mount Sinai Doctors is underway and involves close collaboration among faculty, administrators and Deans. Teams of personnel are reviewing the number and types of physicians who will join the faculty practice (estimated to be more than 700 by the end of 2015). These teams are also projecting the financial, space and staffing needs for these new faculty, and developing uniform standards for quality of care and physician performance. By the end of 2014, it is expected that faculty from four clinical departments will be fully on- boarded from across the Health System. The experience gained in effectuating their integration will provide models for working with faculty joining other departments. On an ongoing basis, the gradual integration of Health System physicians to the Mount Sinai Doctors Faculty Practice will require rigorous planning in order to establish effective record- keeping, clear performance expectations and rigorous financial monitoring for each department at ISMMS. The School's Strategic Plan is complemented by extensive departmental and programmatic planning.. Examples focusing on ensuring appropriate infrastructure (Standard 3) include: Financial Planning Financial planning, monitoring and assessment are integral to virtually every ISMMS program, because a strong fiscal foundation is essential for meeting the goals set forth in our strategic and 12 local plans (Standards 3 and 7). Financial planning includes consideration of investment in educational programs and student services. Financial review is an ongoing activity, with monthly and annual budget planning and reconciliation efforts that focus on the School and individua l departments. The School's Deans, Department Chairs and Institute Directors are accountable for the fiscal performance of the areas under their purview, and meet monthly, or more often as necessary, with the ISMMS Dean and Senior Vice President for Finance to discuss financial planning and assessment. A \"Position Control\" team chaired by the Senior Vice President for Finance oversees all personnel transactions to ensure that hiring and compensation decisions are consistent with the School's objectives and are affordable. Importantly, business plans must be prepared by the departments for all faculty recruits. Expenditures on capital equipment and facilities must go through a similar review process as described below. The School's financial planning and budgeting approaches have been quite effective, resulting in ongoing annual achievement of break -even results that allow for investments to meet our myriad goals and objectives; if at any point this is no longer the case, consideration will be given to cre ating and applying more stringent or alternative metrics. Capital Planning Capital planning is an essential process that ensures that the School fulfills its mission and accomplishes its goals in a fiscally responsible manner. Weekly capital planning and assessment meetings bring together representatives from the Dean's Office, Finance, Facilities Management, Engineering, Vivarium and Information Technology to review, assess and monitor projects. A senior leadership team comprised of the ISMMS Dean, the education deans, the Senior V.P. for Finance and facilities experts convenes each September to review capital planning requests for the following year. Each project must be compatible with the Strategic Plan, with a sound business model that demonstrates both fiscal viability and consistency with our educational, research and clinical goals. Projects are prioritized based on: deferred projects of importance; commitments to new chairs and faculty recruits; and space problems requiring correction. Projects deemed elective are moved lower on the list, to be pursued only if money and other resources are available. After an ordered list of priority projects is created, the Dean's Office funds initial cost studies for project deemed highest priority. These studies involve rough plans and associated cost estimates, and if approved th e projects can move forward. Once funding is identified for a project, contractors will be hired through a competitive bidding process. To the extent possible, timetables are compressed to minimize disruptions to our students and faculty. In the past three years, capital improvement projects have included repurposing of space to provide additional classrooms (Annenberg 10 and 11), renovation of a lecture hall (Annenberg 12) and creation of an incubation lab for student/trainee entrepreneurs (in progress on Annenberg 11). The effectiveness of the capital planning process was evident in the successful and on-budget construction of the 550,000 sq.ft. Hess Center for Science and Medicine, completed in 2013 and housing a state-of- the art conference center, laboratories and clinical space. Academic Informatics and Technology Academic I nformatics and Technology, comprised of the Levy Library, Academic IT Support, Multimedia Services, Instructional Technology, and Archives and Record Management 13 (Standard 3), has undergone a significant transformation in the last decade, as print volumes have largely been replaced by web -based collections and on- line learning resources have become the norm. As the print collection yields to new ways of researching, studying and learning, the retirement of the School's Library Director provided an opportuni ty to re -think the focus and purpose of the library. Towards this end, a position for Vice President of Academic Informatics and Technology (with an Associate Dean title later added) was created with broad responsibilities for overseeing the library and instructional and educational technology; defining , building and leading a service-oriented Academic Informatics unit; delivering technology platforms, tools and services that support faculty teaching and research; and integrating information technology into the curriculum to enhance student learning and engagement. The Academic Informatics and Technology team was charged by the Dean with developing a vision for the role of academic technology in the School. Towards this end, they are developing a three -year plan that includes repurposing current library space into an information commons, updating and consolidating Health System library resources and services and ensuring that the Upper East Side campus is the nexus for library and informatics support. Core Research Facilities and Services Planning Institutional shared research facilities, or \"Cores\" (Standard 3) are subject to intensive scrutiny to ensure that they function properly and adequately meet the needs of the School's research community (Stan dard 7). The Dean for the Basic Sciences and the Senior Associate Dean for Research Resources work closely together to lead decisions on the research infrastructure and to conduct long-range planning. Their end goal is to ensure that ongoing and new proj ects have access to state-of-the art resources (equipment and expertise) to meet the needs of our students and faculty. An Executive Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC) comprised of department chairs, institute directors and other senior faculty contribute to the strategic planning process by considering what Cores will be needed over the next five years. The ESAC reviews the scientific justification for proposed new cores, and makes recommendations on phasing out obsolete cores. All cores are reviewed on a three to five year cycle by a three-member panel comprised of both internal and external members. Typically proposals to establish new institutional Cores are initiated by users from multiple departments and disciplines or via a departmental core t hat transitions to an institutional resource. The review of proposals uses an approach resembling an NIH Study Section for shared instrumentation grants. The review has three primary criteria: 1) Scientific justification (ESAC review); 2) Business plan (Financial review); and 3) Infrastructure needs (Engineering review). These three aspects allow for adequate planning and implementation of proposed new resources. In summary, ISMMS takes a robust approach to planning in all areas. The careful consideration paid to our mission, long and short term goals, and the internal and external environments, combined with broad input from relevant constituencies create planning processes and outcomes that effectively serve the needs of the School and its s tudents. 14 Standard 3: Institutional Resources Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) has a rich infrastructure to support the educational, research and clinical activities that comprise its mission. Decisions regarding the type, quality and quantity of resources are closely tied to the planning, allocation and assessment processes (Standards 2 and 7). The interrelatedness of these processes and their connection to the School's mission ensure the availability of appropriate resources to meet our needs and fulfill our goals. Appendix 3-A points to particular sections of the Self-Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Institutional Resources. Rational, consistent, well publicized policies and procedures contribute to a strong ISMMS infrastructure. In an era of limited resources, escalating costs, a challenging NIH landscape and extreme competition, the School leadership insists on defined perf ormance metrics, adherence to protocol, tight monitoring and controls, and extensive communication to ensure that resources are used and distributed rationally, equitably and transparently. Bidirectional planning and decision -making are encouraged through communication of information and feedback from subordinates up to supervisors, as well as down from leaders to the broad School community. Most School activities in some way relate to the educational experiences of our students, so that resource investments typically directly or indirectly translate into a superior educational environment. Some key resources and their attendant allocation policies are described below. Finances The 2014 School budget is approximately $1.8 Billion, up from $1.5 Billion only four years ago. The continued rapid growth of the budget is attributable to many factors, including: an increase in faculty practice volume and revenues; the addition of approximately 100 new research faculty who have attracted considerable extramural grant funding; royalty income; and Hospital purchased services and support for faculty recruitment. The faculty practice has been achieving budgeted growth rates of six to seven percent. Record levels of NIH grant funding to both new and longer term ISMMS investigators are a great source of pride for the School this year, and are a reflection of the faculty's hard work and dedication to cutting- edge research. Unrestricted operating budget performance - actual (2010 to 2014), budgeted (2015) and estimated (2016 to 2019) - is presented in Appendix 3-B. Revenue and expense data from prior years form the baseline for forecasting future budgets. It is noteworthy that although tuition and fees comprise a very small portion of total annual income, a far larger percentage of annual expenditures are instructional and departmental in nature. Financial planning, assessment of financial performance and allocation of resources are inextricably intertwined, and ensure that the ISMMS remains fiscally sound so that it can carry out its mission. The School uses a well -defined, broadly promulgated, formulaic, mission- based budgeting methodology known as \"CARTS\" for its C linical, A dministrative, R esearch, T eaching and Strategic components. This budgeting approach considers funds flow to address both operational and strategic needs at the departmental level, but always within the context of 15 broader institutional needs and goals. Unrestricted financial operations are required to break even or show positive results over all each fiscal year. The Senior Vice President for Finance (SVP) and the ISMMS Dean meet weekly to review financial results; by identifying potential problems early, they can work with departments to plan for and pursue corrective action. The Dean and SVP meet weekly with the CEO for a School Strategy meeting, and also meet with the CEO regularly to review, and as necessary refine, the financial strategic plan. The Dean and SVP also report up to the Board of Trustees Finance Committee, providing a monthly report and meeting with the committee bimonthly. Independent audits are conducted annually by an external accounting firm. The Dean and SVP monitor Departmental financial performance on a continuous basis, meeting regularly with Department Chairs and Institute Directors to review financial results and business plans to support new initiatives. Each fall, all parties meet to plan for financial needs for the following year and to establish an appropriate budget; this is a multilayered process that allows for ample exchange of information and ideas before final budgets are set. The level of cooperation and collaboration is high and contributes to sound and reasonable budgets that have the buy- in of all parties. For educational programs, the A-R- T and S co mponents of CARTS fund administrative support (\"A\"), research support (\"R dollars\"), faculty teaching services (\"T dollars\"), student services and investments in strategic (\"S\") program initiatives. \"T dollars\" have proven to be a particularly successful way to motivate and reward educators. Introduced a decade ago, they represent an allocation to departments based on the teaching efforts of their faculty. Because faculty compensation is based on revenues linked to their various activities, faculty have an incentive to teach so that they will generate T dollars to bolster their income. This approach contrasts quite favorably with prior practices in which not only were there no financial rewards for teaching, but faculty often found themselves at a compensation disadvantage if they dedicated more time to teaching and less to activities that generated revenue for them. CARTS support for teaching activities is carefully monitored, and during budget season in particular the SVP of Finance examines teaching s ervices, course funding, student services, infrastructure and other components of the teaching programs. The SVP meets with the education deans to review performance against budget and discuss possible changes based on both internal and external factors in order to ensure that appropriate financial support is available to meet teaching program needs. Facilities/Physical Plant Most buildings on Mount Sinai's Upper East Side campus are used for educational activities. The recent creation of the Health System has added member hospitals as learning sites for our medical students. The Dean's Office maintains an inventory of facilities on each campus , monitors utilization to ensure that space is optimally allocated, and leads capital planning efforts. Appendix 3-C provides a sample blueprint for a floor in the Annenberg Building. 16 As described under Standard 2, a standing capital projects group monitors repair, renovation and construction needs on a regular basis; the group includes representatives from the De an's Office, Finance, Facilities Management, Engineering and Information Technology, and as needed user constituencies are invited to provide input, thus ensuring that all relevant voices are heard. Collaboration and communication are key to the identification, planning and implementation of capital projects. An annual schedule is created for projects, which takes into consideration need, funding availability (including, particularly for educational projects, philanthropy) and timing. In certain project s student input is particularly important, such as for the planning of the new student lounge that is part of a large renovation of the Annenberg lobby. Major facilities serving the needs of the School include: Classrooms and Lecture Halls - Although the majority of classrooms and lecture halls are in the Annenberg Building, the new Hess Center for Science and Medicine has added to the inventory; additional locations include the Icahn Building and the Kravis Center for Advanced Medicine. T he lecture halls and meeting rooms at Health System member hospitals are also utilized for educational purposes, primarily postgraduate. Recent capital projects to address educational needs have included upgrades to classrooms and a lecture hall on Annenberg 12 and creation of new classrooms on the 10 th floor. A portion of the Annenberg library has been repurposed to house the highly successful Graduate School elective on innovation and entrepreneurship. Increasing student enrollment in particular programs, the addition of programs and the emphasis on small-group learning are all taken into consideration in space planning, decision-making and allocation. Research Facilities and Related Resources - High quality, plentiful research resources provide an excellent environment for medical students and graduate students to undertake research projects. Mount Sinai's large research enterprise is made possible by an abundance of laboratories spread over four buildings: the recently completed Hess Center for Scienc e and Medicine, the Annenberg Building (where ongoing laboratory renovations are in progress), the Icahn Medical Institute and the renovated Atran-Berg Building. An impressive array of institutional shared research facilities (\"Cores\") provides state -of-the- art instrumentation and methodologies to support the School's research programs. Cores are staffed by experts who not only provide research services, but also offer instruction and training that constitute a major educational resource for those wishing to diversify or explore new avenues of research. Services are provided on a fee -for-service basis, with partial subsidization by institutional funds to keep costs reasonable for all. Recently, training fees for these Cores were eliminated in order to remove a potential access barrier for students, postdoctoral trainees and junior faculty. Each institutional Core has a standing advisory committee (AC) comprised of facu lty, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows that meets semi- annually with the Core Scientific Director, Core Manager and Core Administration to review user feedback and consider performance. In this way, the AC serves in an advisory role to the Dean. The Senior Associate Dean for Research Resources leads a central administrative group that supports all business functions of the Cores (billing, hiring, repairs, equipment acquisition, etc.). This team conducts a monthly financial analysis of each Core, including utilization rates, fees and 17 user satisfaction. The Senior Associate Dean meets with the Dean for Basic Sciences every two weeks to discuss issues pertinent to the Core resources program, and once per month meets 1:1 with the Core Directors. Stan dard 2 addresses planning and resource allocation decisions relating to institutional Cores. Institutional cores are supplemented by an array of departmental, institute and center core research facilities. Some of these entities offer their own cores when access to resources must be limited and specialized equipment is required. Access is primarily to members of these areas but resources are available to collaborators or upon special arrangement. These cores are not subsidized and generally do not charge fees to users. Research Space Allocation - Productivity is an important factor in the assignment of space to faculty. Benchmarks are well defined and widely publicized. Research density, a calculation of extramural funding per square foot of laboratory space, is used to assign additional space to successful investigators and to condense the laboratories of less productive researchers. Even with the addition of considerable research space in the Hess Center, demand continues to outstrip available space, so that we are exploring off- campus leases for funded investigators. The research density metric is evaluated periodically and in light of the tightening NIH landscape has been amended to recognize the special challenges that junior faculty face in acquiring grant funding. Clinical Facilities - Mount Sinai provides both outpatient and inpatients settings for clinical learning. The 1,171 bed Mount Sinai Hospital shares the Upper East Side campus with the School. Outpatient student experiences take place in the Mount Sinai Doctors Faculty Practice on 98 th Street, the Center for Advanced Medicine and the new Hess Center for Science and Medicine; some students also gain experience in private practice offices of our voluntary faculty in the local community. With the creation of the Mount Sinai Health System, students will increasingly have rotations and electives at five new member hospitals. Students also gain experience at affiliated academic institutions, most notably Elmhurst Hospital Center, which is part of the municipal hospital system, and the Bronx Veterans Administration Medical Center. The variety of clinical venues presents exciting opportunities for our students to train with populations that are diverse ethnically, socioeconomically, and culturally. The School is currently renovating a building on 85 th Street to provide expansion space for the faculty practice, which is functioning at close to capacity; this project was an outgrowth of the ad hoc committee that Dean Charney charged with finding options for adding to clinical space. Residential Buildings - The Aron Hall dormitory is owned by Mount Sinai and houses medical students, graduate students and postdoctoral trainees. Mount Sinai also owns 25 apartment buildings with nearly 2,000 units within walking distance of the Upper East Side campus. MD and PhD students are guaranteed institutional housing and indeed, most choose to live in our buildings. Postdoctoral trainees do not have priority access to institutional housing, but because of the large inventory of apartments many postdocs do in fact get assigned to apartments, which they can rent for up to three years. Mount Sinai maintains some master leases that secure a set number of apartments in local residential buildings to accommodate the excess demand. Faculty are not eligible f or Mount Sinai housing but in many cases recruits are offered housing loans or other relocation assistance if they are moving to New York. 18 Information Resources Academic In formatics and Technology (AIT) serves as the information resources and technology hub for all students, residents, fellows, and the clinical and basic science faculty of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. It is comprised of four components: Gustave L and Janet W. Levy Library - The library is the core of AIT, with an extensive collection of biomedical resources that includes over 50,000 e-journals, 100,000 e-books and over 150 databases covering clinical information, education, statistics, patient education, and more, all accessible both on campus and remotely. The library's collection also includes several apps and mobile optimized resources. The research services provided include an on-demand Ask-a-Librarian service and research consultations with librarians on searching the biomedical literature, bibliographic data management, bioinformatics, statistics, systematic review methodology and other topics. Additional library services include interlibrary loan and document delivery, printing, scanning, photocopying and phone charging stations. Competence in information literacy is an expectation of all educational programs, and the Library's instructional/information literacy program is outlined in Appendix 3-D. Appendix 3-E provides library utilization statistics for the past year. Archives and Records Management - This group e nsures that Mount Sinai's historical records (in all physical and electronic formats) are managed and preserved according to their value, leading to more efficient storage of these records; provides historical information and images about Mount Sinai for use in research, lectures and publications; and provides records retention guidance to ensure compliance with all laws, regulations and internal policies. Academic IT Support Center - Supports students, faculty, and staff through: distribution of site-licensed software; assistance with resolving hardware and software computing issues; configurin g secure email access on mobile devices; assignment of network logins and email accounts for users on medical school computing networks; and management and questions regarding Google apps for students. Instructional Technology Group - This team as sists wit h instructional design to promote and demonstrate thoughtful integrations of instructional technology with teaching and learning; manages and supports the Learning Management System (Blackboard) for students and faculty; provides the Lecture Capture System (Echo 360) to record lectures and classes, making them available more easily to students and faculty; and offers an Academic Medical Illustration service to support the research, publication and teaching of faculty and students. AIT also supports faculty and students through library space on the Annenberg 11 th floor dedicated for study and learning. This space includes: 2 hands-on computer classrooms (seating12 and 35); over 80 publically available computers loaded with research tools including EndNote, SAS, and SPSS; study tables, carrels and small group study rooms. Library spaces are open seven days per week, until 11pm most weekday nights and with extended hours during exam times. In 2014 ISMMS AIT supported over 100,000 user requests, stored over 4000 hours of lecture content, managed 800 Blackboard courses, provided users with over 340,000 digital periodical searches and hosted 260,000 Levy Library visitors. 19 ISMMS Website Marketing, development/programming, content management, search engine optimization, social media, and design teams within the Health System's Digital and Social Media Department build, enhance, and maintain the School's website and related social media properties. Their services include updating content, assisting in the development of new and improved departmental or program websites, and providing technical assistance. A major initiative has just commenced to overhaul the entire School website in order to improve user experience, maximize the presentation of important information, and ensure that the site serves the School's mission and goals. The process began with a series of interviews with School leadership, faculty and key staff, and over time will incorporate feedback from many other audiences to ensure the website serves as a useful resource for the entire ISMMS community. Computational Resources ISMMS has invested significantly in high performance computing resources to support our research and educational programs. In 2012, the School purchased a supercomputer dedicated to improving scientific discovery for researchers at Sinai. Dubbed \"Minerva\" after the Roman goddess of wisdom and medicine, it consists of 7,680 AMD compute cores, 30,000 gigabytes of memory, and 1,500,000 gigabytes of high speed parallel storage. It has a peak speed of 70,000 gigaflops, and provides approximately 64 million hours of computation per year. A recent $2M NIH grant to ISMMS will enable purchase of an additional, specialized supercomputer and data analysis engine to support genomics- based research for a broad range of diseases; approximately 24 NIH-funded Principal Investigators will directly benefit from this new resource. Supercomputing capabilities comprise only one piece of the research information technology infrastructure at Mount Sinai. Data management, specimen management, data mining/data marts and e-learning are also offered in support of research efforts. Additionally, the School has invested in the development of a new electronic research administration system known as \"Ideate\" to simplify and expedite the research application submission process for investigators and other research personnel in support of our research mission. Personnel ISMMS has approximately 2,700 full-time faculty, and over 99% have doctoral degrees in fields relevant to their educational, teaching and clinical roles. Many of these faculty teach in the degree -granting programs and the postdoctoral clinical and research programs. A high faculty- to-student ratio provides generous staffing for didactic settings and also gives students a large complement of mentors, advisors and role models to support their clinical and research interests. The MD, PhD and Master's program s are taught almost exclusively by full -time faculty whose primary commitment is to Mount Sinai and to teaching and scholarly activities. The number of full- time faculty has increased dramatically in the past five years for two key reasons. First, recruitment efforts outlined in the Strategic Plan have resulted in growth of the research and clinical faculty. Second, the creation of the Health System has added to the faculty size in the past year. Most faculty based at member hospitals are clinicians, and many have 20 experience in teaching medical students, residents and fellows (Standard 8); some also conduct clinical research which presents exciting new opportunities because of the large, more diverse patient population served by the Health System. Investment in faculty for the educational programs continues to expand. Two recent examples involve the MD/PhD program: creation of an MD/PhD core course and associated funding for faculty teaching efforts; creation of two paid associate directors - both faculty positions - will enhance program oversight and student contact. ISMMS also has approximately 2,300 voluntary faculty and 450 part- time faculty. The voluntary faculty tend to be physicians with practices in the community; their teaching is typically directed to residents and clinical fellows in The Mount Sinai Hospital, although some do occasionally mentor medical students. Part- time f aculty are hired primarily to provide a limited, defined clinical service and have few or no responsibilities relating to teaching. The School employs approximately 5,200 full- time staff. Their credentials are related to the type of work that they perform, and the recruitment process includes an evaluation of an applicant's education and experience relative to the needs of a particular position. Human Resources offers staff development programs to expand skills and enhance job performance. Resource avai lability is taken into consideration during both faculty and staff recruitment. For faculty, the hiring department must submit a business plan to the Dean and SVP for approval prior to extending any offer. Both faculty and staff compensation must be approved by Position Control (chaired by the SVP for Finance) prior to any commitments being made. In addition, faculty recruitments require articulation of facility needs and identification of appropriate research and/or clinical space prior to any commitmen ts. In summary, ISMMS provides abundant resources for the conduct of the School's educational, clinical and research activities. Strong planning efforts, tight systems of controls and rigorous approaches to assessment ensure that School resources are all ocated wisely, with ample consideration given to purpose, utilization and goals. In these ways, the School is able to allocate its highly valued resources in a judicious manner that allows it to fulfill its mission. 21 Standard 4: Leadershi p and Governance Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) has a well- defined governance structure that ensures appropriate decision -making, sound policy development and adequate oversight. Appendix 4- A highlights relevant sections of the Self -Stud y report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Leadership and Governance. ISMMS is chartered by the Board of Regents of The University of the State of New York, acti ng for and on behalf of the New York State Education Department. In 2013, ISMMS' charter was amended to reflect the addition of a passive parent to the School's corporate structure. This change occurred as part of a transaction involving three partners: The School, The Mount Sinai Hospital and Continuum Health Partners. A new not- for-profit parent holding company, the Mount Sinai Health System, Inc. (MSHS), became the sole corporate member of the School. The authority of MSHS is limited to electing the School's Board of Trustees. The School's trustees have independent, individual fiduciary responsibility to act in the School's best interests. MSHS is not authorized to conduct education programs or to operate the School, and does not have any resources (employees, facilities, budgets, etc.) to do so. The School retains its authority to make decisions that are best for the School, unencumbered by outside influences that might be detrimental to its ability to fulfill its mission. This new structure was r eviewed and approved by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education through its Substantive Change process. ISMMS's governance structure is set forth in its Bylaws . The Bylaws delineate the powers, size, qualifications, selection, and resignation processes of ISMMS' Board of Trustees, officers and committees of the Board of Trustees (BOT) and identify the key executive positions in the School, e.g., the Dean, Associate Deans and Assistant Deans. The Bylaws also describe the powers of t he Health System. The ISMMS Bylaws articulate the: organization of the Board of Trustees (including composition, meeting frequency and committee structure); roles and reporting relationships of the Chief Executive Officer, the Dean and other School leaders; governance structure; requirement of faculty rules and regulations; budgetary authority; and conflicts of interest standards. Currently 55 trustees serve on the Board. Until the expiration of the terms of the current trustees, the Trustees Committee of the Board has the authority to elect trustees. Upon expiration of the terms of the current trustees, the Health System shall have the authority to elect trustees. Trustees come from a variety of professions and bring experience in finance, law, commu nications, education, public relations and other areas so that they are able to contribute to the School in myriad ways. Many trustees are deeply involved in philanthropic initiatives in connection with ISSMS. Trustees are not compensated for their service on the Board of Trustees. Trustees are subject to the same conflicts of interest policies as are ISMMS' faculty, staff and students (Standard 6) in order to ensure that decisions are made in the interests of ISMMS without their personal financial interests influencing the Trustees' performance as members of the ISMMS Board. Trustees complete an annual disclosure form relating to their personal 22 financial interests, and potential, actual or perceived conflicts are addressed and if necessary managed by the Trustees Conflicts of Interest Committee, a subcommittee of the BOT Executive Committee. The Board of Trustees or its Executive Committee meets monthly. Standing agenda items include approval of faculty appointment, promotion and tenure recommendations; the agenda also typically includes proposed poli cy changes for review, such as recent changes to our conflicts of interest in research policy. The Bylaws entitle each trustee to one vote on matters submitted to the Board and require a quorum in order for the Board to take an action; a majority vote is required for approval. The monthly meetings also provide an important opportunity for the senior leadership team to apprise the Board of new issues, concerns and initiatives and to solicit Trustee input and endorsement. Numerous standing committees of th e Corporation/Board of Trustees are described in the Bylaws and provide targeted oversight for School activities ranging from educational programs, research, clinical care and resources to planning, compliance, finances and external affairs. Meeting frequ ency depends on the purview of the particular committee; quarterly meetings are typical. Together these standing committees offer expertise and support that help ensure that the School fulfills its mission, is fiscally sound, maintains appropriate resourc es and abides by internal controls and regulatory requirements. In addition, the Board may establish additional standing or special committees. Committee members are designated by the Chairman of the Board and approved by the Board. Standing committees of the Board include the Executive Committee, which has all of the powers of the Board of Trustees to the extent permitted by law. Other important committees fall into the following categories and include: BOT Trustee Oversight Committee Trustees Committee - Recommends candidates for vacancies in the Board of Trustees and for committee chairmanships and membership of each committee; reviews performance of sitting trustees and officers, oversees Board of Trustees' self -assessment, new trustee orientation and ongoing trustee education, and identify governance issues. BOT Education Committees Graduate School Committee - Monitors matters relating to doctoral, Master's and the MD/PhD programs, as well as matters relating to student housing, accreditation and other perquisites. Medical Education Committee - Monitors matters relating to the MD program, medical resident training and continuing medical education and training programs, and matters relating to student and resident housing, accreditation and other perquisites. BOT Research and Clinical Care Committees Research Committee - Monitors School research matters including those relating to extramural research grants, and policies and procedures relating to human subject safety. Patient Care and Quality Assurance Committee - Reviews and monitors provision of patient care and quality assurance activities, professional staff development and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 23 Technology Transfer Committee - Monitors matters relating to patents, licensing and related activities. BOT Pla nning and Resources Committees Strategic Planning Committee - Develops and recommends to full Board or the Executive Committee strategic plans for approval. Real Estate and Facilities Committee - Monitors matters relating to the real estate and facilities, including management, maintenance and renovation and construction, acquisition of new properties, and sale or transfer of existing properties. Information Technology Committee - Monitors information systems, e.g., management information systems, data processing, clinical technology, and computer technology. Development Committee - Monitor matters relating to philanthropic fund raising, donations and testamentary and deferred gifts. Finance Comm ittee - Monitors matters relating to School finances, including annual budget of revenues, expenses and capital expenditures; monitors and establishes appropriate levels of general and professional liability, property and other types of insurance. Investm ents Committee - Supervises the investment of the School's endowment and other funds and accounts. Compensation, Employee Benefits and Employee Relations Committee - Reviews and approves matters relating to personnel, labor relations, collective bargaining and compensation and fringe benefits of employees; establishes compensation and fringe benefits for senior and/or highly compensated personnel; and serves as, or delegates and appoints, fiduciaries for employee benefit plans. BOT Legal and Compliance Committees Legal Committee - Monitors the legal affairs, including litigation and the services of outside counsel. Audit and Compliance Committee - Monitors the integrity of financial statements; financial reporting processes and systems of internal controls; compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and standards of ethical conduct; qualifications, independence and performance of independent auditors; and performance of internal audit and compliance functions. BOT Outreach Committees Community Affairs Committee - Monitors matters relating to relationships with communities served and local community leaders. Government Affairs Committee - Monitors matters relating to School relationships to federal, state, and/or local governmental agencies. Public Affairs and Marketing Committee - Monitors public relations, including dissemination of information through the press and other media The Chief Executive Officer, who reports directly to the Board of Trustees, is invested with the authority and responsibility necessary to operate ISMMS and all of its activities and departments. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the development, submission and implementation of all plans to maintain ISMMS' compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. 24 The Dean, who is the Chief Academic Officer of the School, has powers and responsibilities determined by the Bylaws and specific duties confirmed by the Chief Executive Officer (Standard 5). The Dean reports to the Chief Executive Officer who, in turn, reports to and is monitored by the Board. Appointment of the Chief Executive Officer, Dean and major School leaders (such as Department Chairs, Executive Vice Presidents, and Deans) are all subject to approval by the Board of Trustees to ensure that those selected are appropriately qualified for their positions. These officers are not members of the Board of Trustees. The performance of the CEO and ISMMS Dean are evaluated annually by the Board of Trustees. The Dean conducts annual evaluations of all department chairs and institute directors, as well as the deans who report directly to him. Sub-deans are evaluated by their direct supe rvisors. The Faculty Handbook , which is posted on the mssm.edu website, describes the governing bodies within the School. This includes descriptions of the structure, composition and charge of the Faculty Council and its committees. It also describes the nine standing committees of the Dean, which are charged with focusing on many critical areas, e.g., curriculum, admissions, promotions, grievance, conflicts of interest, and faculty appointments and promotions. The Dean seeks input from many sources on major decisions. The Dean's Leadership Board is chaired by the Dean and is comprised of Department Chairs, Institute Directors and Deans and votes on major policy changes for the School. Examples of policy changes approved by the Dean's Leadership Board in the past year include revi sions to the faculty appointments and promotions methodology and to the conflicts of interest in research policy. In addition to the Dean's Leadership Board, the Dean has recently initiated meetings in alternating months of a Dean -Clinical Leaders group a nd a Dean -Research Chair leaders group. The Dean presides over each meeting of the clinical group, and will alternate with the Dean for Basic Sciences in chairing the research leader meeting. It is too soon to determine whether this new structure will ac hieve the focus and dialogue that are essential in each area; with time, the success of the separate meetings will be evaluated and will either be formalized as the norm or will be adjusted if necessary. The Faculty Council is comprised of 51 peer- elected representatives from the academic departments and interdisciplinary institutes of the School. Four subcommittees of the Council, including an Executive Committee, focus on specific areas as defined in the Faculty Handbook. The Faculty Council provides a forum for discussion and serves as the collective voice for the faculty by providing a link from the faculty to the Dean. The Council has a website on which it posts a roster of representatives, an email address for soliciting input from the faculty at l arge, Council minutes and documents relating to its governance. The Council was reformulated approximately five years ago to create a more effective body, and indications to date are that it has been successful. Council members are taking an increasingly active role in soliciting input from their department/institute faculty and in turn taking issues to the administration for discussion. Examples of the influence of the Council have been modifications to the School's travel policy based on Council input and adjustment of the benefits policy in response to concerns raised by representatives. The Faculty Council is beginning to address the issue of 25 representation of faculty based at Health System member hospitals and is considering the optimal size of the C ouncil, methods of communication across sites and election processes. The Student Council serves as the voice of the students in the School's degree granting programs. A total of approximately 60 elected members are assigned to three groups: General Body, consisting of class reps, program reps (i.e. MD1s, MD2s, MD/PhDs, Genetics), with subcom mittees on areas such as Housing and Academic Technology; Financial Management Team (comprised of class and program representatives) and an Executive Board (Council president, vice president, treasurers - elected from the Financial Management team). The Student Council communicates frequently with the study body through regular email updates, posting of minutes, newsletter and a new website. The Executive Board meets monthly with the ISMMS Dean and select education deans, thus ensuring ample opportunity f or exchange of information and ideas. An annual survey of students conducted by the Council addresses all aspects of student life, and the findings are provided annually in a report to the Board of Trustees; the survey indicates overwhelmingly high morale and enormous satisfaction with the School's educational programs. An entire chapter of the Faculty Handbook ( Chapter IV ) is dedicated to defining the various types of faculty and their attendant responsibilities. ISMMS faculty members hold a primary appointment in an academic department (and often secondary academic appointments). Occasionally, faculty whose interests and responsibilities are split equally among two departments may receive a \"joint primary\" appointment. Multidisciplinary Institutes at ISMMS complement the traditional academic departments and foster collaboration. Faculty having research and/or teachin g interests and/or responsibilities consistent with one or more Institute's goals can also be appointed as members of those Institutes. In summary, ISMMS' governance structure and decision- making processes are clearly defined and support ISMMS' ability to carry out its mission. ISMMS is fortunate to have an active and committed Board of Trustees. Its dedicated subcommittees for Research, Medical Education and the Graduate School provide special opportunities for Trustee focus, input, oversight and resourc es for the related but unique issues of each program, and are enthusiastically embraced by our trustees. ISMMS provides many venues for faculty, students and staff to have input regarding decisions affecting them, and regularly monitors and evaluates thes e processes to ensure that they continue to enable constituencies to participate in ISMMS' governance function. 26 Standard 5: Administration From its inception until 2013, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) partnered with The Mount Sinai Hospital under an organizational umbrella known as the Mount Sinai Medical Center. In 2013, the Medical Center combined with Continuum Health Partners to create the Mount Sinai Health System, which is comprised of seven member hospitals and ISMMS. In order to provide the historical context for the current ISMMS administrative structure, this section includes references to both the Medical Center and the Health System. The ISMMS Bylaws stipulate that a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), appointed by and reporting to the Board of Trustees, is responsible for overseeing all functions of the School (Standard 4). The effective performance of the CEO is assessed on an ongoing basis by the Board of Trustees to ensure that the CEO and the organization comply with statutory and regulatory requirements and carry out appropriate oversight. The Dean, the Chief Academic Officer of the School, is appointed by the Board of Trustees; the Dean reports to the CEO and to the Board and is evaluated by them. The Dean provides periodic updates on School performance to both the CEO and the Board, including presentation of metrics focusing on the multiple components of the School's mission as well as strategic planning initiatives, and in turn receives their input. Together, they ensure that the School carries out the educational, research and clinical components of its mission. The Dean of ISMMS, Dennis Charney, MD , was appointed in 2007. Dr. Charney, an experienced administrator and world -renowned physician -scientist, is well qualified for the challenges of this position. He was recruited to ISMMS from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 2004 to serve as Dean for Research, and within one year was given an expanded role as Dean for Academic and Scientific Affairs. Prior to his NIMH position, Dr. Charney worked for over two decades at Yale University As Dean for over seven years, Dr. Charney's tenure exceeds the average for medical school deans (estimated at four years in a 2007 survey), a testament to his success as a leader, educator, scientist and scholar. He is a role model for students, faculty and administrators alike. Under Dean Charney's leadership, the School's academic, scientific and clinical programs have never been stronger. Dean Charney reports to Kenneth Davis, MD, the CEO of the Mount Sinai Health System. Dr. Davis is an internationally acclaimed investigator of Alzheimer's disease. He was appointed to his current role in 2013, having served previously as CEO of the Mount Sinai Medical Center (2003 - 2013), ISMMS Dean (2003 - 2007) and Chair of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai (1987-2003). As these dates indicate, for four years, Dr. Davis was both Dean and CEO, an atypical joining of these roles at Mount Sinai, but one that enabled Dr. Davis to steward both School and Medical Center through a difficult period of financial and organizational challenges. As a seasoned administrator with vast knowledge of Mount Sinai, Dr. Davis successfully created tight fiscal controls, strong oversight tools and clear expectations of performance accountability for all employees from most senior to junior. He laid the foundation for the financially sound, highly productive environment of the School today. In 2007, the Board of Trustees separated the Dean and CEO roles so that the School and Medical Center would each have its own designated leader; it was at this point that Dr. Charney was appointed Dean of the School. 27 Appendix 5- A illustrates the organiz ational structure of the School and the network of leaders who carry out its mission, develop and implement its plans, and play key roles in the strategic decisions regarding its educational, scientific and clinical programs. Fourteen deans support the ISMMS Dean by providing targeted leadership in specific areas. Some of these deans are directly responsible for the mission -based educational, research and clinical programs, while others are more focused on infrastructure, overseeing such areas as operations and academic affiliations. In light of Dr. Charney's emphasis on faculty development and mentoring, there is also a Dean for this. Department Chairs and Institute Directors oversee the academic d epartments and report directly to the ISMMS Dean. The Senior Vice President for Finance completes the senior team and is charged with ensuring that the School is and will continue to be fiscally sound. With the exception of the SVP and Dean for Operations, who have M.B.A. degrees, these leaders all have doctoral degrees in medicine and/or science, as well as programmatic and administrative experience in their areas of expertise. Chairs and Directors oversee 34 academic departments and 22 multidisciplinary institutes respectively. They are responsible for the programs, personnel, finances and operations of their entities. The administrative structure of large departments often includes divisions focused on specific areas of expertise; these are led by Division Chiefs who report to the Department Chair. In addition, many departments have one or more Vice-Chairs with broad responsibility for a particular area, e.g., Vice Chair for Education. Every department has an administrative team that is responsibl e for the business activities of the department; the administrator reports to the Chair and also works closely with the SVP for Finance. Senior Associate Deans, Associate Deans and Assistant Deans support the senior leadership team; those with faculty app ointments have doctoral degrees and most others have master's degrees in a relevant field. The Senior Associate Dean title was introduced in 2013 after the creation of the Mount Sinai Health System; eight associate deans were promoted into this title in recognition of their broader responsibilities relating to integrating member hospital faculty and programs into the School. Additionally, Site Chairs were appointed for every clinical department at every member hospital; reporting up to their System Chai rs in the ISMMS academic departments, the Site Chairs partner with their System Chairs on integration. Deans at all levels work closely with each other, with the Chairs and with the SVP for Finance to ensure optimal goal achievement through rigorous planning, assessment and appropriate resource allocation. The School employs approximately 5,200 staff. The recruitment division within the Department of Human Resources (HR) ensures that the credentials of incoming staff are appropriate to their positions. H R offers staff development courses that train new and veteran staff in a wide variety of skills, ranging from increased computer competencies to public speaking to supervisory training. PEAK, an on-line learning platform, was recently introduced as an additional venue for learning; PEAK is able to track employee completion of mandatory training courses to ensure compliance. Faculty development activities are described in Standard 10. 28 Lines of authority are well defined and well known. Every faculty rec ruit receives an offer letter and a job description that identify the person to whom they will report. Similarly, new staff view job descriptions as part of the application process, and upon hire receive a letter from Human Resources than includes the nam e of their direct supervisor. The Information Technology team has created an on -line reporting tree for each unit which is especially important during the annual evaluation process, when supervisors must assess the performance of all staff under their purview. The administrative structure is modified on occasion in response to changing needs, as in the creation of the senior associate dean title as described above. Another example was the creation of a single Bursar's Office, one Financial Aid Office and one Registrar for all of the degree granting programs, which evolved from discussions about the similarity of administrative functions in the MD and Graduate School programs. Their integration has resulted in concentrated expertise, improved efficiency and financial savings (Standard 9). Another recent administrative structural change is the reorganization of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery into a separate Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and a Department of Thoracic Surgery. This split was implemented after analysis of the large increase in surgical volume following the creation of the Mount Sinai Health System; the higher volume combined with an environment of rapidly expanding options in disease diagnosis and treatments specific to thoracic surgery argued strongly for a distinct thoracic department that would better serve patient needs, aid clinical faculty recruitment and enhance research endeavors. Similarly, the increase in the number of multidisciplinary Institutes (Standard 2) is an outgrowth of the changing biomedical landscape and a commitment to maximize the research and clinical capabilities of the School. In summary, the ISMMS administrative structure is well organized for the effective and efficient conduct of the educational, research and clinical activities that are central to the School's mission. A talented, energetic and creative leadership team oversees and guides the School's programs and ensures they achieve the highest standards of excellence. Appendix 5- B highlights some of the sections of the Self-Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Administration. 29 Standard 6: Integrity The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) provides a work and learning environment that is transpar ent, ethical and fair. Faculty, staff and students alike are expected to conduct themselves with integrity in all aspects of their roles and at all times, and are supported by policies and procedures that make clear the expectations for every member of th e ISMMS community. Appendix 6-A points to some key sections of the Self-Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Integrity. Academic freedom is integral to the ISMMS culture. The Student and Faculty Handbooks specifically articulate adherence to the principles of academic freedom. For example, the statement of academic freedom articulated in the Faculty Handbook addresses freedom in research and resultant publications, and in classroom teaching relevant to one's area of expertise. At the same time individuals are protected from institutional censorship or discipline, there is acknowledgment of each person's responsibility as a member of the academic community to be accurate, to act appropriately and to respect the opinions of others. Policies are posted on the School website for easy accessibility. Faculty rely on the Faculty Handbook as their major source of relevant policies; in 2013, a supplemental web- based resource, \"For Fa culty,\" was created to facilitate faculty access to policies, procedures and services. Students rely on handbooks for their particular programs, e.g., Medical Student Handbook , Graduate Student Handbook, MPH Student Handbook . The Human Resources Manual and the Compliance Manual have policies that are applicable across status and job titles. All of these handbooks and manuals help students, faculty and staff to know about both their obligations and rights in the School. Constant review and reconsideration of policies is conducted to ensure that they remain relevant to the ever -changing environment and needs of our students, faculty and staff. Following is a summary by area that demonstrates the School's commitment to maintaining an environment in which transparent policies, processes and attitudes help to form and guide the behavior of every member of the ISMMS community. Diversity - The School promotes an inclusive environment that welcomes students, faculty and staff from all backgrounds. ISMMS abides by Equal Employment Opportunity regulations, and School policies protect against discrimination for any reason, including gender, ethnicity, culture, socioeconomic situation, sexual orientation or disability. The Center for Multicultural and Community Affairs (CMCA) provides an environment that nurtures and supports students and trainees from groups underrepresented in the medical and biomedical research workforces; the ISMMS Dean's Faculty Diversity Council and Diversity in Biomedical Research Committee supplement the efforts of CMCA by addressing a range of student, trainee and faculty issues. The Disability Services Office is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for students with physical, learning or psychiatric disabilities. The Office for Women's Careers strives to advance the academic careers of women at ISMMS and to address potential barriers to their success; the goal of the Women in Science and Medicine program developed by this Office aims to enable and empower women at all levels to achieve their professional and personal goals. 30 Student Programs and Services - There are many ways in which ISMMS ensures a fair, supportive and ethical environment for its students. These include: Student Handbooks - As described above, on-line student handbooks contain policies and procedures that all ISMMS students need to know. Student Handbooks are revised annually to ensure that the most current policies and processes are included. Both the MD program and Graduate School Handbooks contain a Code of Conduct emphasizing professionalism. Ethics Education - Ethics is taught in many venues. For example, the Responsible Conduct of Research Course, which is mandatory for all students and postdoctoral fellows engaged in biomedical research, reflects the School's commitment to integrity in research, and actuall y surpasses NIH guidelines for content. Upon entering the MD program, students take a Medical Student Oath that emphasizes honesty, compassion and commitment to patients. Medical students receive ethics training throughout their time at ISMMS, including in the Arts and Science of Medicine course and various clerkships. Admissions - Admission criteria for each degree -granting program are posted on the web. New members to the admissions committee are oriented to the review process to ensure that every applicant receives fair consideration. Consumer Information - Student outcomes, including graduate and attrition rates and MD program placement rates are posted online, as are the fire safety report and the annual Security and Safety Report. Course Catalogues - The Graduate School posts its course listings online. The MD program, however, has a proscribed set of courses for the first two years of study and descriptive information about those courses is provided. Every degree- granting program offers suffici ent courses to ensure timely student graduation. Advancement - The websites of the degree- granting programs, as well as the relevant student handbooks contain the requirements and expectations for advancement to the next level; this applies both to promotion within a program and to meeting requirements to graduate. The Student Promotions Committee plays a central role in student promotion and preparedness for graduation. Student Grievances - The student grievance process is described in Standard 9. Disci pline - The Student Handbooks address the issue of discipline. In the MD program, the Promotions Committee, which is comprised of both faculty and students, reviews and discusses situations and votes on proposed actions. Precedents established in prior c ases are taken into consideration in determining whether discipline is appropriate, and if so in what form. Students have the right to appeal a disciplinary action to the ISMMS Dean. Academic Integrity - In addition to the commitment to Academic Freedom described earlier in this section, policies that ensure the integrity of the academic enterprise include: Authorship - Clear guidelines are provided on assignment of authorship, the contributions that merit authorship and order of authorship. Individuals are encouraged to communicate clearly prior to commencement of manuscript work in order to clarify expectations up front and avoid possible disputes later in the process. Ethical Practices in Research : This policy makes clear the expectation of integrity in the conduct of research. It further outlines the process for addressing allegations of research misconduct. 31 Research Integrity Officer (RIO) - A designated senior member of the faculty oversees the review of allegations of scientific misconduct; our RIO, Dr. Reginald Miller, is one of the longest- serving RIOs in the United Statements. His excellen ce in guiding this process has resulted in a request by the Public Health Service to host an \"RIO Boot Camp\" at Mount Sinai in 2015. Sponsored by the Public Health Service, the Boot Camp will put forth ISMMS as a model program and the standard for teaching RIO courses. Intellectual Property Policy -- The School has a robust policy on the identification and protection of intellectual property. Personnel - A host of employee policies provide well defined, clear guidelines for faculty and staff. As part of their on -boarding process, faculty are required to sign an \"Affidavit and Acknowled gment of Policies\" to confirm that they are aware of major policies and where to locate them. Some important policies and practices that apply to all employees include: Job Descriptions - All faculty and staff recruits receive a job description that outlines their duties and scope of responsibility. They are also informed in writing of the person to whom they directly report. Performance Reviews - Annual performance evaluations are required for all employees. Although the evaluation tools differ for faculty and staff, both are designed to promote feedback, clarify expectations and improve communications. Reviews are also taken into consideration during compensation and promotion review. Code of Conduct and Professionalism - Faculty, students and staff are expected always to act in a professional manner, and policies help to clarify this. A Faculty Council Professionalism Committee was established in 2010 to adjudicate faculty problems that cannot be resolved at the department level. Ombuds Officers are available to respond to complaints by or about faculty, students, trainees and staff. The School Director of Human Resources is also available to investigate allegations. These policies and avenues for complaint are designed to encourage all members of the Mount Sinai community to behave fairly, courteously and appropriately. Harassment - The anti -harassment policy and the role and processes used by the Grievance Committee to address allegations are accessible through the faculty, student and postgraduate handbooks. Compensation - In all cases, compensation must reflect Fair Market Value and equity. The Faculty Compens ation Policy and associated processes are posted in the on -line Faculty Handbook. Staff compensation is determined by the Human Resources Compensation Division, which analyzes the demands of a position and the experience of a particular applicant or incumbent. For both faculty and staff, the Position Control team led by the School's Senior Vice President for Finance reviews compensation recommendations prior to implementation in order to assess need and ensure availability of funds. Some policies that apply specifically to faculty include: Faculty Appointments, Promotions and Tenure (APT) - The Faculty Handbook outli nes the criteria and methodology for academic appointment, promotion and tenure. The institutional APT Committee rigorously follows these rules in reviewing candidate applications in order to ensure that fair and equitable consideration is given to each candidate. The on- line policies are supplemented by periodic Faculty Development events to ensure that the 32 methodology is widely known and understood; the most recent all- campus Faculty Development Symposium dedicated to APT issues was held on October 30, 2014. Similarly, APT education sessions for new Health System Site Chairs were conducted this past spring, to ensure that they are familiar with the methodology and can advise and support their faculty. Discipline and Termination - Faculty Handbook guidelines carefully and thoroughly articulate the process for faculty discipline. The Faculty Disciplinary Tribunal , a Committee of the Faculty Council, adheres scrupulously to these published guidelines to ensure due process for faculty who request a hearing to contest a disciplinary action. Staff discipline is coordinated by the Office of Labor Relations within the Department of Human Resources. Financial Integrity - As described under Standards 2, 3 and 7, ISMMS takes a strong and broad approach to creating and maintaining a sound financial environment. On an annual basis, an independent auditor reviews the School's financial statements to ensure that they comply with generally accepted accounting principles; external financial consultants are available throughout the year to consult on specific situations and to confirm ongoing compliance . Conflicts of Interest - The School's Conflicts of Interest (COI) Office is responsible for monitoring any financial relationships that faculty, staff and students may have with industry. The goal of the Office is to protect the School and its students and f aculty from any potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest. Three policies that apply to all faculty, students and staff and help protect against conflicts of interest are: Business Conflicts of Interest - All trustees (Standard 4), executives and paid faculty are required to disclose their financial interests through an on-line Annual Report on Relationships with Outside Entities. In addition, the COI Office reviews proposed draft contracts that faculty or staff wish to enter into with industry, to ensure that the needs of the School are protected. Complex cases that present possible conflicts may be reviewed for a determination by the institutional Business Conflicts of Interest Committee. - Educator Disclosure of Financial Interests - Since 2010, the Department of Medical Education has required t hat all faculty and speakers in the MD program disclose their financial interests prior to teaching so that administration and audiences are aware of the potential for biased presentations. Financial Conflicts of Interest in Research - Research team members must disclose financial interests each time that they submit a research project for review or ap proval so that a determination can be made regarding whether any financial interests that they have might be relevant to the research. This policy helps to protect the design, data collection and analysis, and reporting relating to the study from any possi ble bias. The Financial Conflicts of Interest in Research Committee and staff are responsible for developing plans to reduce, eliminate or manage any conflict identified in connection to a research project. Interactions with Vendors and Other Commercial Entities - These guidelines explain restrictions on vendor interactions, e.g., prohibitions against accepting gifts, food or pharmaceutical samples. Such restrictions help to ensure that student, faculty and staff judgment and decision- making are not influenced by commercial entities. 33 The Conflicts of Interest Office will soon be expanded in order to ensure that our growing faculty receive sufficient attention and support in terms of reporting and as necessary managing their financial interests. The recent launch of the Federal Open Payments system underscores the importance of full disclosure and transparency in this regard. Communications - The Marketing and Communication team ensures accurate and complete reporting on ISMMS activities, and provides oversight for all press releases and public relations documents, while our Human Resources Department has guidelines for advertising. There is considerable interaction between the media staff and our academic departments in this regard, and often the Dean's Office is also consulted to ensure the accuracy of information. Both the M.D. and Graduate School programs put tremendous effort into providing accurate information to current and prospective students. Significant changes to services, programs, leadership, etc. are announced to the entire ISMMS community through broadcast emails. As needed, Town Ha ll meetings are convened to address broad changes. Important information relating to the School is always posted on the website. This includes accreditation information such as our Middle States status and relevant information; prior to going to the Board of Trustees for final approval, this Self-Study report will be posted on the website in order to encourage community input. Key information from the Verification of Compliance with Accreditation -Relevant Federal Regulations is similarly posted. The School is also committed to keeping Middle States informed of major changes. For example, a Substantive Change request was submitted to and approved by Middle States in 2013 when the Mount Sinai Health System replaced the Mount Sinai Medical Center. In summary, ISMMS is diligent in its efforts to represent itself accurately and to treat all members of the School community with dignity, fairness and respect. Policies are broadly disseminated, communication is frequent and accurate, and faculty, students and staff are well versed in the rules and processes that are so important to creating an environment of integrity and honesty. 34 Standard 7: Institutional Assessment Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) readily meets and exceeds the requirements set forth in Standard 7 by following a rigorous institutional assessment approach that ensures that the School remains true to its mission and attains its goals. Performance assessment is inextricably linked to planning and resource allocation processes; in an environment of competing needs and finite resources, careful monitoring helps to achieve maximal effectiveness in all areas. Appendix 7 -A highlights some sections of the Self-Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Institutional Assessment. The Dean sets forth expectations of thorough, thoughtful, ongoing assessment at all levels, from the institution as a whole to departments, institutes, programs and even individuals. At all times, these ass essments tie in to mission, goals and objectives and their related planning and resource distribution. He directs his leadership team to oversee these efforts and provide frequent updates to him. The Deans for Education, Research and Clinical Affairs are each accountable for performance in their respective areas of responsibility, and to the extent that there is overlap across areas they are jointly accountable. In the same way, every Department C hair and Institute Director is accountable for the performance of his/her entity, and together are expected to contribute to the success of the School. The Dean meets regularly with each these leaders to review performance vis a vis goals and objectives. As supplements to these 1:1 meetings, the Dean chairs monthly group meetings with all area Deans, Chairs and Directors; the meetings provide an important ongoing forum for clarifying expectations, identifying difficulties, sharing triumphs and planning for ongoing success. Recognition of the importance of collecting, analyzing and discussing objective data is an integral part of the School's culture. Although not every aspect of our work is quantifiable, to the extent possible the Dean and his leader s place a high priority on utilizing metrics to compare and assess performance. Internal and external benchmarks are used, and may change over time in response to internal or external exigencies. Industry standards can provide a powerful tool for comparin g ISMMS performance with peers. Similarly, home- grown metrics can capture information for areas that are unique to the School and its programs. Dissemination of metrics and outcomes ensures transparency, so that the broader community is aware of expectations and results. Following are examples of the School's assessment approaches in each of the three main areas of our mission - education, research and clinical care. Educational Performance All educational programs at ISMMS are expected to attract high ly capable students and to provide an outstanding learning experience to them. Offering a stimulating, vibrant educational environment that prepares our students to be excellent clinicians, scientists, public health experts and leaders with a commitment to lifelong learning is of paramount importance. As the educational program leaders, the Dean for Medical Education and the Dean for the Graduate 35 School of Biomedical Sciences are responsible for evaluating the quality of all degree- granting programs and e nsuring that the School satisfies its mission and meets its goals. The information below on the overall assessment of educational programs and student learning is addressed in detail in Standards 11 and 14. Continuous monitoring of program objectives and student success are central to the assessment process. Broad approaches include: MD Program - Comprehensive assessment exercises target student achievement of specific program goals and objectives as well as preparedness for the next phase of training ; - Student evaluations of content and teaching methods - Faculty evaluation by both students and course directors - Annual course and clerkship reviews. Graduate School - Faculty committees assess whether students have achieved certain \"progress points\" in order to advance - Tools confirm achievement of core and advanced skills, plus critical reasoning, communication and mastery of responsible conduct of research - Annual - or if needed more frequent - meetings of Program Directors with the Dean of the Graduat e School for ongoing assessment of students' progress and discussion of programmatic issues - Annual retreat by each degree -granting program to review course and program strengths and weaknesses and develop recommendations for program revisions. Among the many metrics used to evaluate institutional success relating to the School's educational mission are: Assessing Student Body/Student Performance Student Qualities - ISMMS seeks students who are highly intelligent and well prepared to excel in our rigorous academic environment; equally important are diversity of gender, culture and experience. Each year, a detailed profile is created of the entering class in order to evaluate the success of the admissions processes in meeting these goals and to determine how our numbers compare with those of our competitors. Metrics include GPA, MCAT and GRE scores, which have been rising each year so that our current classes overall boast some of the highest grades and scores in the history of the School. Gender and ethnic diversity are also important and are evident in our overall enrollment figures. Diversity of experience is similarly apparent. The FlexMed early admissions program introduced in academic year 2013- 2014 has already increased the variety of students' academic backgrounds, with a strong showing in computational science, physics and engineering. National Benchmarks of Comparative Performance - National standardized exams (USMLE Steps I, II CK and IICS, NBME shelf exams) provide invaluable feedback on MD student performance and competencies so that the School can assess its effectiveness in preparing its students; additionally, to the extent a vailable we also compare ISMMS student scores with 36 those of students at other schools. The Graduate School of Biological Sciences uses reports from the National Survey of Graduate Faculty and the AAMC to compare ISMMS data with that of graduate programs in other medical schools, which is valuable for identifying strengths and possible weaknesses. Postgraduate Placements - Residency Match - Each year, after fourth year medical students learn which residency training programs they have been accepted into, the MD program analyzes the \"match\" data as a means of evaluating program success in preparing students for the most desirable residency programs, and determining where ISMMS stands in relation to its competitors. - MD Student Feedback - Graduation surveys - both the AAMC Graduation Questionnaire and an internal ISMMS survey - are valuable tools for evaluating the MD program experience. In addition, program directors who oversee the internship placements of ISMMS graduates are polled regarding the preparedness of these newly minted physicians for residency programs. - PhD Placements - All graduating students are interviewed by the Dean of the Graduate School and/or a relevant Program Director about career plans and placements. By monitoring postdoctoral placements, the Graduate School can assess its success in preparing students for highly coveted positions in academia and industry. Students who do not complete the doctoral program are also interviewed. Each student completes an Exit Survey; the data is presented to the Steering Committee of the Graduate School for insight to possible program weaknesses that might warrant changes. Years to Graduation - The completion rate and median time to program completion for matriculated PhD students is monitored by the Graduate School. The data are presented to the Steering Committee of the Graduate School by the Graduate School Dean or Program Director for discussion and evaluation. This information has stimulated a reconsideration of the optimal length of the training period for both the PhD and MD/PhD programs, and may spur changes. Student Publications - Peer -reviewed publications are an import ant metric. Particularly for doctoral students, the quality of publications emerging from their thesis work is an indicator of the School's training success. The growing emphasis on medical student research experiences will increasingly make their publications an important measure. Commitment to Community - Because becoming an outstanding physician requires compassion as well as commitment, the MD program values not only grades but also strong interest in the greater social good. Indeed, this is an important part of the School's mission, and we can look proudly at the many remarkable programs which our students have organized or joined to confirm our success in this area. Community outreach activities that bring MD students into collaborative relationships with residents and caregivers of our adjacent East Harlem neighborhood - one of the poorest zip codes in the country - include the East Harlem Health Outreach Partnership (EHHOP) (providing health care to uninsured residents), the Community Health Impro vement Project (health screenings), First Generation Scholars (MD students mentoring high school students), the Human Rights and Social Justice Scholars Program, and Hands on Science (creating videos for pediatric patients). Increasing student interest in international health issues is reflected in their rising participation in the activities of Mount Sinai's Institute for Global Health. Both the number of students participating and the quality of the services delivered attest to goal achievement in this area. 37 Assessing Educational Program Quality Teaching Quality - Evaluations take place at multiple levels. Students complete evaluations of their faculty in every course and clerkship, and Course and Clerkship Directors review all faculty teaching evaluations. As a result, faculty receive ample feedback on their s uccess as educators. As necessary, corrective action plans are developed to enhance performance and progress is monitored; if remediation does not succeed, a faculty member may be removed. Faculty success as educators in an important consideration on individual annual faculty performance reviews by department chairs. These reviews supplement the feedback that faculty receive from students and course directors and help them understand how their teaching activities are valued within their home academic department. Further, these reviews allow for discussion between a faculty member and his/her Chair of the relative time devoted to educational activities compared to other endeavors, and whether a realignment of work duties is needed. Training Grant s - NIH training grants for PhD and MD/PhD programs are a prestigious source of support and a valuable measure of the quality of our graduate training programs. Performance assessment includes tracking new and renewed grants, and also securing feedback from the NIH to our annual progress reports as well as the extensive competitive renewal evaluations undertaken every five years. As NIH support for training grants shrinks nationwide, our ability to retain or increase our complement of slots will be closely monitored by the School Curricular Reform - In the past year, in concert with the tenets of our Strategic Plan, the MD program developed and implemented curricular reforms to enhance the educational experience of our students. The increasing prominence of the MD program as a national leader in educational innovation is reflected in a recent award to ISMMS from the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation to organize a national \"summit\" on pre-medical education. Undergraduate science educators, pre -health advisors, medical school admissions deans, leaders of innovative curricular programs, leaders of post baccalaureate programs and leaders of successful pipeline programs and diversity initiatives convened to engage in a discourse on potential improvements. Over the course of two days, participants educated each other on each discipline's best practices, current innovations, challenges and ideas for the future. Members of each discipline contributed to what will ultimately be a white paper on the future of pre -med preparation. The Graduate School uses student surveys and other feedback to assess program quality and student satisfaction. Strategic planning efforts currently in progress for the PhD and MD/PhD programs (Standard 2) are heavily influenced by student input on the strengths and weaknesses that they perceive in such areas as curriculum and scheduling. The Graduate School carefully tracks the volume of applicants interested in each training area and its connection to a multidisciplinary Institute in order to assess the impact of the Institutes on the number and quality of prospective students. The recent introduction of a new MTA in Design, Technology, and Entrepreneurship is an example of the responsiveness to student feedback; it has proved enormously popular with students and confirms that our increasing emphasis on biomedical innovation has strong relevance for our students. 38 Accreditation Reviews - Many of the degree -granting programs are periodically evaluated by an accrediting organization in their field. All provide opportunities for self- assessment and improvement, confirm that we meet all standards set by all agencies, and provide valuable f eedback to the programs. The accrediting bodies include: - Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) - As the accrediting body for the MD program, the LCME conducts a broad review that encompasses curriculum, resources and assessment methods, and provides an important source of feedback on the program. In 2012 the LCME granted a full eight- year reaccreditation to the MD program. - Council on Education in Public Health (CEPH) - CEPH conducts regular annual reviews of the Graduate Program in Public Health and a full accreditation review every seven years. The program was fully reaccredited through December 2015. The next full review will take place in 2015, and we expect to receive full reaccreditation through December 2022. - American Council for Genetic Co unseling (ACGC) - The program was granted full reaccreditation in 2008 for a period of six years, and each year during this period the program submits an annual report to assure continued compliance with standards. The next reaccreditation self -study is p lanned for September 2015. - New York State Department of Education (NYSED) - The State has a timetable for review and re-registration review for degree-granting programs. Student Loan Default Rate --The three- year default rate was 1.5% as of September, 2014. This extremely low level reflects successful default management that emphasizes information, communication, and strategic reduction of the average total loans of our graduates. It is also important to acknowledge the role of the Board of Trustees subcommittees in ensuring the highest possible quality for the MD, PhD and Master's programs. The Deans for Medical Education and the Graduate School meet quarterly with their respective Board committees and Dr. Charney to review performance, obtain feedback and chart action for attaining even higher levels of excellence. Research Performance Conducting high-quality, innovative research and providing outstanding research experiences to our students are critical components of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai mission. The Strategic Plan's emphasis on translational research adds struct ure and direction to these endeavors. There are many ways in which the School assesses its success in fulfilling its research mission and achieving its research goals, including: Extramural Funding - The $247 million awarded to ISMMS by the NIH funding in the recently ended Federal fiscal year speaks to the School's strength as a biomedical leader; this represents an increase of $32.9 million or 15.4% compared to last year, a remarkable achievement in the face of the challenging NIH funding landscape. In the latest available data, ISMMS ranked 17 th in NIH funding among all medical schools in the United States, and this number may rise given this year's spectacular performance. ISMMS has made steady progress in securing NIH funding, jumping in a decade from a rank of 25 th nationally; this has been achieved through a combination of focused leadership, vision and planning, the 39 extreme dedication of faculty and staff, and intensive recruitment consistent with our Strategic Plan. Included among the NIH awar ds are 19 training grants from seven NIH agencies in support of our research education efforts. The NIH peer- review process for grant applications confirms the excellence of ISMMS research programs. Foundation grants - some of which are also peer reviewed - and industry funding provide important additional sources of support that are closely assessed for their contribution to our research success. Investigator spending on extramural research grants is carefully monitored. For NIH grants in particular, th e spending rate drives associated indirect cost funding, an important source of support for the School's infrastructure. Accordingly, we strive for timeliness and consistency in grant expenditures and investigators are notified early if their spending rat es are problematic so that they can take steps as appropriate. Research Density - Optimal allocation of ISMMS wet and dry laboratory space is achieved through the application of research density targets - grant funding/net assignable square feet - to all research programs (Standard 3). This metric is critical to allocating research space - an expensive and limited resource - carefully and methodically, and it is a factor in capital planning discussions. Investigators who fall below research density targets may be subject to space reductions, while those exceeding targets may be eligible for more benches or space. The increased complement of laboratories created by the recently opened Hess Center for Science and Medicine has eased research space allocat ion in the School; in contrast to our pre-Hess ranking as third among all U.S. medical schools on research density, we are no longer one of the most tightly constrained. Nevertheless, space continues to be a challenge and we must be vigilant to allocate o ur inventory wisely. Funding Per Investigator - This is another grant- related metric that we examine on an annual basis. Currently ISMMS is 4th nationwide in research funding per investigator, which reflects an intensive level of productivity and high peer acknowledgment of our research programs. Scholarship - Original publications in leading peer- reviewed journals are an important indicator of achievement, whether by an individual or as part of team science. Textbook chapter authorship and editorial leadership are also valued. The faculty appointment, promotion and tenure methodology gives careful consideration to publication records that reflect innovative contributions to the body of literature. Citation factors are a useful tool for assessing success in this arena at the institutional and in dividual levels. Intellectual Property - Mount Sinai Innovation Partners (MSIP) is an ISMMS office dedicated to patenting and commercializing intellectual property generated by our faculty and students. Such activities are essential for bringing new technologies from the laboratory to the public benefit, and are both an indicator of mission fulfillment and an important potential source of income for the School. Examination of MSIP performance metrics by the Board of Trustees Technology Transfer subcommittee prompted an increased funding commitment by the School in 2012. The attendant expansion of MSIP staffing has resulted in an increase in the volume of patent applications and licensing opportunities. 40 Core Research Facilities - In order to remain responsive to rapidly changing scientific needs and increasingly sophisticated technologies, the School continuously monitors the efficacy and utilization of each Core so that as appropriate the School can modernize, restructure or even sunset technologies, methodologies and facilities. Two assessment mechanisms are used: 1) Three Member Review Panel - Each core facility is reviewed every three to five years by a panel comprised of two experts from outside ISMMS and one in-house expe rt. The two external experts are recommended by Core users, scientific directors or other members of the scientific community; the internal expert is a user who is familiar with institutional policies and procedures; and 2) Executive Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC) - The ESAC, comprised of department chairs, institute directors and other senior faculty, assists the Dean's Office with long -term planning for resource needs. This includes the review of new core resource proposals. Through these two mechanisms the School leadership is apprised of changes in technology, management concerns, and needs for future investment planning. Research Administration - Prompted by an in-house survey of investigator satisfaction in 2013, an initiative to streamline and improve the centralized research administration functions in the School has resulted in a variety of changes. These include development of performance metrics (e.g., turn -around time on internal review and approval of grant protocols). Such metrics give research infrastructure departments such as the Program for the Protection of Human Subjects the ability to pinpoint problem areas and implement corrective actions. The survey feedback also contributed to a decision to replace our existing on-line grants management with one that is more user-friendly. By dissecting the ways in which we do business ISMMS is increasing efficiency and facilitating changes which are expected to improve investigator satisfaction. Clinical Performance The ISMMS mission e mphasizes the importance of providing excellent clinical care to our patients. Closely tied to this is the expectation that the MD program offers outstanding pre- clinical and patient -centered experiences to our medical students. Our success in fulfilling this clinical mission and thereby providing a superb venue for students, is assessed in many ways, including: Quality of Care - The range of metrics for evaluating the quality of care provided by our physicians continues to grow. In response to both internal and regulatory requirements, clinicians are held accountable on a broad range of quality metrics, many of which are monitored through a clinical \"dashboard\" that allows for frequent review and, if necessary, corrective action. The introduction in 2008 of EPIC, an electronic medical record system, has been instrumental in improving access and availability of clinical performance data. Patient satisfaction ratings are another means of assessing physician and staff performance in the delivery of care, and are used to create staff development sessions on \"customer\" service. Finances - Mount Sinai Doctors Faculty Practice is a growing physician practice group which currently has approximately 1200 members. Financial oversight encompasses revenue and expense monitoring, volume, activity by specialty and utilization of resources. Faculty 41 practice volume and net revenues have grown steadily over time as a result of higher volume, higher productivity and more efficient space utilization. Clinical Productivity - Relative Value Units (RVUs) are a key measure of physician productivity. They vary by specialty and can be adjusted to take into consideration the unique circumstances of a practice. Careful monitoring of RVUs is essential to gauge individual physician activity levels and is tied to the faculty practice compensation model. RVUs also add value in assessing the overall productivity of programs, departments and the faculty practice as a whole, and are valuable in addressing weaknesses and rew arding strengths. Clinical Space Density - Space limitations in clinical areas require careful monitoring of utilization to optimize provider productivity and patient access. Reports generated by the Faculty Practice include exam room utilization (numb er of visits per exam room per session) and Fill Rate (average number of booked minutes per provider session decided by the session length of four hours). Finances ISMMS has a well -defined financial management system which includes careful oversight (Standard 3). Ongoing assessment of fiscal performance is essential to ensuring that we have sufficient resources to fulfill our mission and meet strategic goals. A variety of tools contribute to fiscal assessment, including: Budgets - The School's strong fiscal health and consistent break-even budget is attributable to strong financial controls and excellent dialogue and collaboration of the Dean, Senior Vice President for Finance, Department Chairs and Institute Directors. Despite an increasingly competitive clinical environment and a shrinking Federal research budget, the School has managed to grow and thrive. Financial information is prepared, disseminated and assessed monthly and annually, with budget monitoring and excellent communication ensuring that problems are addressed and resolved early and efficiently. Revenue Sources - Revenues are generated from a variety of sources relating to the School's education, research and clinical activities, and these are tracked on a monthly basis. Annual Financial Review - In addition to monthly discussions among each Chair, the Dean and the Senior Vice President for Finance - which lead to corrective actions as needed - every department undergoes an intensive annual review which becomes the foundation for budget planning for the next fiscal year. Faculty Recruitment Assessment - Business plans are required in any department wishing to recruit new faculty in order to understand the resource commitments of both school and department. Once hired, actual performance is assessed in relation to the business plan in order to evaluate each recruit as well as entire programs. These evaluations can trigger adjustments to accommodate for unexpected outcomes. 42 Physical Plant Significant investment and oversight ensure the high quality of appropriate facilities that contribute to supporting all components of the School's mission. Ongoing assessment is closely tied to planning and resource allocation (Standards 2 and 3), all overseen by the Dean's Office. Interna l guidelines for space utilization, e.g., research density targets (as described earlier in this section) and clinical exam room scheduling (also described in this section), allow for data-driven analysis and sound decision-making. Information Resources The availability of appropriate information technology for students, faculty and staff is a high priority. The Department of Academic Informatics and Technology (AIT) and its component groups perform regular assessments of services and products. Statistics are collated monthly and are used to guide strategic planning and resource allocation within the department. These efforts include: AIT Services Standing Committee - A committee comprised of AIT staff and student representatives meets monthly to get student feedback on improving current services and creating new ones. Levy Library collects statistics on visits to the library, referenc e and usage of the collection to guide collection decisions. The library's collection policy also recommends adding books written by faculty or requested by faculty or students to the collection when possible, as well as purchasing all reserve books in multiple formats and copies for student convenience. Educational Program Assessments - AIT is assessed by the Graduate School and Medical Education on how well it meets faculty and student needs. Surveys - AIT performs regular student and faculty surveys for assessment, as well as capturing system metrics. Academic IT Support Center (ASCIT) - ASCIT has an in -person Help Desk and also provides support to user requests via telephone and email. ASCIT collects statistics on all user support activity. Averag e response times are tracked, as are transfers to other departments to resolve service issues. Archives - The archivist collects statistics on reference requests, 80% of which come from internal users such as faculty. Health System Resource Review - The Academic Informatics team conducted an assessment of the holdings of the various libraries throughout the Mount Sinai Health System and produced a \"Discovery Report\" that inventories existing resources and recommended consolidation of all resources and services at the Upper East Side campus. Centralizing the management and access of library resources under a system -wide Levy Library leadership struc ture will result in cost and service efficiencies so that the School can maximize its ability to serve faculty, students and trainees regardless of site. Human Resources Recruitment and Compensation - Proposed faculty and staff hires and compensation r equests are analyzed and approved by the Dean's Office. A team chaired by the Senior Vice 43 President for Finance and staffed by the School's Director of Human Resources reports to the Dean on requests for new hires, and assesses proposed compensation, sources of funding and budgetary soundness. The process allows for careful tracking of personnel quality, numbers and costs, and allows for identification of trends valuable to decision-making. Performance Evaluations - Annual personnel evaluations are an important part of the School's culture, receiving considerable attention because of the critical contributions that employees make to programmatic and overall institutional success. Performance evaluations set the st age for rewarding excellence through promotion or increased compensation, and also allow for early identification of problems for which corrective remediation is needed. Different evaluation instruments are used for faculty and staff, but all are done on-line to optimize efficiency and data retention, and to ensure that all personnel who should be evaluated are included. Chairs sign off on every faculty evaluation in their departments, and the ISMMS Dean receives a final report which enables him easily to access the record of any employee. The Dean evaluates his direct -report deans, who in turn evaluate their own more junior deans. Staff are reviewed by their immediate supervisors. External Assessment Measures In addition to the robust internal assessment measures described in this section, external recognition of ISMMS accomplishments provides additional feedback confirming success in all arenas - education, research and clinical care. Some examples are provided below: U.S. News & World Report Ranking - For the fourth consecutive year, this survey ranks ISMMS among the top twenty medical schools in the United States; the current ranking is #19 out of the 153 U.S. medical schools. Fewer than ten years ago the School was ranked #32, and the steep rise is attributable to our rapidly expanding NIH research funding portfolio as well as student profiles (GPA, MCATs) that have never been higher. U.S. News & World Report Clinical Ranking - The reputations of our partnering hospitals is due largely to the ex cellence of the School's faculty. In the 2014 - 2015 U.S. News & World Report \"Best Hospitals\" report, The Mount Sinai Hospital's ranking jumped to 16 out of approximately 5,000 hospitals nationwide, and was designated \"Honor Roll\" status for scoring near the top in at least six specialties. Best Doctors\" Report - New York magazine's 2014 annual report included 142 ISMMS clinical faculty in 59 specialty areas. The School consistently ranks at or near the top for New York City medical schools in terms of the number of physician faculty honored in the magazine's annual survey. 5th Most Innovative Company in the World - In its 2014 Big Data rankings, Fast Company magazine named Icahn School of Medicine #5 among the \"World's Top Ten Most Innovative Companies in Big Data.\" In explaining this ranking, the magazine acknowledged the School's recruitment of top talent to \"map\" patients' genomes, its investment in a $3M supercomputer for data analysis and research, and the BioMed database of genomic samples from more than 25,000 patients. Emory Innovation Award - The ISMMS Global Health Program was awarded the Innovation Award at the prestigious Emory Global Health Case Competition in recognition of its \"out- 44 of-the-box thinking\" for problem resolution. This competition involved student teams from universities around the world. New York City Economic Development Corporation (EDC) Support - EDC has contributed $5,000,000 to ISMMS for the creation of the Mount Sinai Technology Institute. The award was granted in recognition of the promise held by our innovative teaching programs and our commitment to developing new biomedical technologies. NYC Regional Innovation Node (NY CRI) I-Corps Cohort - Two ISMMS teams, one that evolved from last year's \" QED\" innovation class with the Graduate School and a second from our Translational and Molecular Imaging Institute, were selected for participation in the NYCRIM educational network efforts to spur funding for translational research and to prepare students to be entrepreneurially competitive in securing grant funding for their projects; the end -goal is to bring biomedical improvements to the marketplace. It is also worth noting that the QED group separately won $15,000 in a venture capital competition sponsored by Columbia University's engineering department in support of their projects. People under 30 to Watch in Science and Medicine - ISMMS PhD student Jillian Shapiro was chosen by Forbes as one of 30 people under 30 to watch in Science and Medicine for her discovery of a new molecular pathway that can be used to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells that could have significant implications in the development of future therapeutics across disease types. Faculty and Staff Featured in Journal Articles - In addition to the hundreds of professional publications in which ISSMS faculty are authors, we also have many instances in which members of the School community are the subject of very laudatory press. Examples of recent in -depth reporting include: - Center for Personalized Cancer Therapeutics - The December 2013 issue of Esquire magazine featured Mount Sinai and the pioneering work being done under the leadership of Eric Schadt, PhD, Director of the Icahn Institute of Genomics and Multiscale Biology. - Neuroscience - Dr. Daniela Schiller, Assistant Professor of Neuroscience and an expert in memory, was profiled in the May 19, 2014 issue of The New Yorker magazine. In summary, ISMMS uses a broad range of assessment tools to confirm its success in fulfilling its mission and meeting its goals. A well-orchestrated planning process sets the direction for our programs and activities, and strong, well-defined internal controls promote a high level of productivity in all areas. Both individually and collectively, our students, faculty and staff contribute to an institution that can be proud of its accomplishments in the educational, research, scholarly, clinical and service arenas. 45 Standard 8: Student Admissions and Retention The admission policies of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) ensure the enrollment of a student body that is passionate about biomedical research and clinical care, scholarship, community service and advocacy, all in direct alignment with the School's mission. ISMMS offers a stimulating and supportive learning environment that monitors student progress, provides appropriate assistance to ensure student success, posts essential program information and achieves high graduation rates. Appendix 8-A highlights some key sections of the Self-Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Student Admissions and Retention. ISMMS degree -granting programs actively seek to attract a diverse pool of applicants who are high academic achievers with enthusiasm for learning and a commitment to their chosen field of study. Admission characteristics, including grade point averages and standardized test scores, are tracked over time ( Appendix 8-B). Other information such as undergraduate college attended, undergraduate major, previous degrees, extra- curricular activities and professional experiences are also followed. The programs utilize these data for comparative and evaluative purposes. Admission decisions are linked to defined characteristics and standards developed by each program, based on analysis and understanding of what makes successful graduates in each field. Admissions policies and criteria are available to prospective students on the School's website. Links to each program's admissions information can be found in Appendix 8-C. The MD Program has launched several new and innovative programs designed to broaden and diversify the applicant pool while always meeting the School's mission -based goals. FlexMed, a novel early assurance program, had its first admissions cycle, admitting 51 undergraduate sophomore students in June 2014. Students are accepted in their sophomore year of college, and during the remainder of their undergraduate years are encouraged to forego traditional premedical requirements and instead pursue their academic passion in a broad range of fields, e.g., the arts, language, computational sciences and engineering. This flexibility to explore and experience diverse educational pathways is intended to foster a love of learning that will ultimately graduate scholars capable of thinking broadly and leading the future of science and medicine. Following graduation from college, they matriculate at ISMMS, although gap years are encouraged. FlexMed grew out of a robust 25- year experience with an early assurance program called the Humanities and Medicine program in which sophomores with humanities and social science majors received acceptance to ISMMS, finished their degree and then matriculated at ISMMS. Notably, students who entered through the Humanities and Medicine Program did at least as well as students accepted through the regular admission track. As with Humanities and Medicine, a rigorous tracking system will ensure that FlexMed students maintain qualifications and meet undergraduate milestones. A summer enrichment program will be required for students who have less extensive biomedical science preparation. ISMMS has also launched another innovative approach to recruitment that involves an alliance with McKinsey & Company, a leading healthcare consulting firm, which will allow co - recruitment of exceptional candidates from our applicant pool and their junior analyst pool. We 46 have also introduced an experience that would allow current medical students to work in the McKinsey environment for two years during their medical education. Programs like these will allow outstanding students and applicants a chance to be physicians with additional expertise in policy, economics and administration. The Medical School offers several dual degree programs for students who seek augmented experiences to broaden their professional preparation. A Global Health Scholars Program was started in 2013 and the first cohort of six students in a Primary Care Scholars Program will matriculate in August 2015. These programs allow students enhanced exposure to global health and urban primary care respectively. Students in the Global Health Scholars Program earn a Master of Public Health degree in addition to the Doctor of Medicine. Other dual degree programs offer students additional education and training in clinical and translational research, public health and bioethics. Please see Standard 11 for additional information about our dual degree programs. Diversity and inclusion are significant drivers for excellence in medicine and science and represent an important focus of ISMMS. In order to increase the participation of individuals underrepresented in the medical and scientific professions (URMs), the Office for Admissions partners with the ISMMS Center for Multicultural and Community Affairs (CMCA) to enhance the diversity of prospective students. CMCA directs innovative, integrative, and coordinated approaches to achieving a more diverse community in all areas of our mission, and provides an infrastructure to support the recruitment and retention of minority medical and graduate students. The Office for Admissions meets weekly with CMCA to refine recruitment strategies for URMs and first generation applicants. One strategy is a new \"second look\" experience called Explore Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Underrepresented minority applicants accepted by December of the admissions interview cycle are invited back for a tailored return visit in January of the next year. This experience includes in-depth presentations by a cross-section of URM students who explain how they have explored and integrated teaching, research, and service into their medical education experience. The Office of Admissions has also channeled philanthropy to increase scholarship funding for competitive URM applicants, which has served a critical need. Appendix 8- D summarizes gender and URM status metrics for each degree -granting program over the past three years. Our MD, PhD and MD/PhD programs also actively work to diversify the applicant pool through biomedical science research pipeline and graduate programs. Collectively, they expose students to research while encouraging them to consider applying to our MD and PhD programs. Other joint recruitment initiatives conducted by the Admissions Office and CMCA include the Revisit Day for Waitlisted URM Applicants, Revisit Weekend, and the Annual Fall Open House. For all of our academic programs we have conducted targeted recruitment and informational events with minority enrichment high school and college-level programs including the Posse Foundation, Prep for Prep, College Science Technology and Entry Program, and others. We continue to actively target colleges and universities designated as Minority Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions to increase the visibility of our School, our work in diversity affairs via CMCA, and our academic programs. 47 ISMMS is also committed to creating an inclusive school en vironment with regard to sexual orientation and gender identity. Our focus on recruiting applicants who either self- identify as LGBT or are committed to working on LGBT health issues, policies, and programs is a priority for the School. We are actively developing LGBT specific recruitment materials and are working in partnership with our LGBT People in Medicine student organization. Through a dedicated group of LGBT faculty, we have successfully raised monies to promote and offer a generous merit scholars hip in LGBT Health and Advocacy to an accepted applicant. To our knowledge, we are the first medical school to do so. Ongoing Assessment of Student Success Each degree -granting program bears responsibility for evaluating the success of its admissions decisions. For most programs, a designated committee tracks the progress of each student and makes recommendations with regard to promotion. When students are at academic risk, this process includes a review of their previous academic records to determine whether there were early predictors for failure. This information informs regular reviews by program- based admission committees and guides the review of desirable characteristics of future classes and types of support services needed by incoming students. Standard 14 describes many tools that are used to assess student and programmatic performance, and these are often also valuable for measuring the success of our admissions processes. For example, medical students undergo assessments of competency (both formative and summative) which support the goals and mission of the School; these are supplemented by national standardized exams (USMLE Step I, Step II CK and Step II CS and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) third year subject test exams) which assure that student competencies are consistent with national standards and also provide a means to compare medical students' performance and competencies with those at other schools. The National Residency Match Program process provides external validat ion that residency programs nationwide perceive our students to be well-prepared to continue their training. The ISMMS MD student match rate in the past five years is well above the match rate for graduating medical students nationwide. Although the match produces limited quantitative data (as residency programs have only begun being formally ranked in 2014), it nevertheless provides important qualitative feedback. ISMMS students match to what are considered the top facilities and top programs by reputation. The Associate Dean for Admissions is charged with recommending changes to the MD program's admission policies, and some recommendations may be based on analysis of student learning performance or success after graduation. This information is routinely shared and analyzed at the Executive Curriculum Committee, the Promotions Committee and the Medical Education Leadership group. The Associate Dean for Admissions is a member of each of these committees and summarizes feedback from these committees into recommendations for consideration by the Executive Admissions Committee. The PhD in Biomedical Sciences leaders measure the success of the admissions process by examining the outcomes of the graduate education program, including qualifying exams pas s 48 rates, and quality of thesis proposals and final defenses. Every PhD student must pass a qualifying exam in general knowledge associated with his or her training area and successfully defend a thesis proposal prior to moving on to full- time thesis work and PhD candidacy. Student success rates are shared with the Admissions Committee. In addition, MD/PhD students who are supported by the NIH funded Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) grant and other PhD students who are funded by departmental or training area -specific training grants are tracked via an annual progress report to the NIH which summarizes admissions statistics, student publications, attrition, and other important information used to evaluate student success. The Graduate School programs also rely on exit interviews, alumni questionnaires, and student feedback forums to assess whether experiences have met the goals of the student and the mission of the graduate programs. Financial Aid The School is committed to providing our students access to the financial support they need to complete their education. The Office of Student Financial Services , staffed by e xperienced financial aid professionals, has an open door policy and a goal of assisting all students seeking advice and assistance. Information is also posted on the School's website along with a limited list of organizations and agencies that provide external scholarship opportunities Upon enrolling, all students applying for student loans undergo an entrance interview online, and graduating students have an exit in-person interview in the ISMMS Financial Aid Office. Systems are in place to insure that students cannot receive loan disbursements or degrees without completing both the entrance and exit interviews. The ISMMS financial aid award package includes a list of the students' loans and current interest rates, grace periods, and residency repayment options. The default rate at ISMMS is 1.5% as of September, 2014. In processing federal financial aid, ISMMS requires both the FAFSA application and a \"Needs Analysis\" report from the Access Group , a non- profit organization that specializes in higher education financing for students in graduate and professional programs. This report provides additional information about the student and family, assuring uniformity of information across the student body. The Director of Financial Aid, in conjunction with the Senior Director of Enrollment Services, reviews all available information, assures that determination of need criteria are applied fairly and consistently, considers extenuating circumstances, and maintains adherence to Title IV Program criteria. Tuition and associated costs vary across the ISMMS degree-granting programs. 68% of medical students graduating in the Class of 2014 received financial aid through the Financial Aid Office. Of those, 40% received some type of scholarship aid. The majority of ISMMS scholarship support is need- based and is automatically awarded to eligible candidates without an additional application process beyond the standard FAFSA/Need Access procedure. ISMM S has limited endowed scholarship funds, which are awarded by the Admissions Selection Committee based on donor requirements, student academic credentials, and the candidate admissions interview. Students receive merit -based assistance on top of their need-based aid, not to exceed cost of attendance. The Financial Aid Office notifies matriculating students of scholarship offers received from outside agencies. 49 Our medical students obtain loans to fund a significant portion of their cost of attendance. T he average medical school debt of indebted graduates at ISMMS in 2014 was $129,763 (Appendix 8-E). The School leadership's proactive commitment to supporting our students has identified scholarship fundraising as a priority for the Development Office and a robust strategic plan has been implemented. All PhD and MD/PhD students in Biomedical Sciences and Neuroscience receive fellowships that cover a stipend, health benefits and tuition remission. The NIH -funded Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) s upports a subset of MD/PhD students during their first two years in the program, with the Graduate School covering the balance. During the years dedicated to thesis work, students are supported by funds provided through their thesis advisor. The Graduate School ensures that internal funding issues do not hinder progress toward a degree. PhD students are guaranteed support as long as they remain in good academic standing, even if their mentor loses funding or leaves the institution. In these cases, student s are temporarily covered by institutional funds until alternative funding is identified. Transfer Policies The School's transfer credit policies are documented in the Student Handbooks and are available to prospective and enrolled students. Transfer credit is rarely requested by ISMMS medical students; among current medical students, none has transfer credits. Infrequently, a Masters or PhD student will request transfer credit. In such cases, their transcripts, syllabus and course content are reviewed by the Program Director to determine if credit transfer is warranted, and final approval by the Dean of the Graduate School is required. Only 11 graduate students (2% of those currently enrolled) have received transfer credits. Students may also request a course exemption. In the rare instance that a student requests an exemption, he or she must pass an assessment arranged by the program director to determine whether the exemption should be granted. The policies and procedures for transfer credits are included in the Graduate School Handbook. Dissemination of Information about Educational Programs The School's website contains a wealth of information about its medical and graduate school programs, their respective curricula, and the expectations of how students will progress through their program of study. Descriptions of the curricula include information about educational formats, such as didactic coursework, small group learning, journal clubs, laboratory experiences, and clinical rotations, as well as information about program requirements, such as the thesis proposal and defense for all PhD and Master's degree programs. The considerable information posted about academics is supplemented by ample information on support services, student governance and quality of life issues. Together, this information is a valuable resource for both prospective and current students. Throughout the admission process, prospective students have access to a wide array of information about the School and the various degree granting programs. Important admissions information and links to the online applications for each program are posted on the website. For 50 some programs the online application is followed by interviews and site visits, during which structured presentations not only outline the timetable for learning outcomes, but also highlight histori cal student performance. This information is extremely valuable to prospective students and helps to guide their consideration of our programs. The School's website is the most important venue for marketing our programs and sharing detailed information with prospective students. A concerted effort has been made in recent years to improve the content and navigation capabilities of the education sections of the website to make it more accessible users. Despite this effort the overall design and functiona lity of the School's website has limitations. A large scale initiative has been launched to fundamentally rework the website and the educational program staff will be engaged in this important project. In 2013, the School created a strategic marketing pl an with a focus on enhancing its messaging and outreach efforts. Plan goals included increasing visibility and promotion of the School's unique identity, integrating medical and graduate school marketing materials and actively using students in both the design and execution of our marketing plan. A staff position was established to provide expertise and to organize marketing efforts. Implementation of the plan involved streamlined and coordinated efforts to connect with prospective students and applicants. The School's website was restructured, integrated print materials were created, and video and slide presentations were developed and are now utilized for internal and external recruitment efforts. Further, the School engages accepted students, current students and alumni as ambassadors at their undergraduate institutions and post-graduate environments to complement this initiative. The results to date have been well received. In summary, ISMMS has robust admission policies and practices that are well publicized and ensure a diverse, talented student body that is well suited for success in our academic programs. Student progress is carefully tracked to ensure that potential problems are addressed early so that enrollees can complete their program. Reg ular assessment of admissions policies and student outcomes ensure the ongoing relevance and success of these endeavors. 51 Standard 9: Student Support Services Providing outstanding student support is central to achieving the educational mission of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). The School offers a wide array of support services to ensure the academic progress and overall well -being of students enrolled in all of our educational programs. Support and mentorship programs across the institution enable students to seek career guidance, access resources to promote health and wellness, and connect with peer and faculty programs for academic and educational support. These programs are designed to support students at advanced levels and create a platform for success in an adult learning environment. Appendix 9-A highlights some key sections of the Self-Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Student Support Services. Qualified professionals manage and deliver the support services necessary for our students' academic and professional success. The Medical Education and the Graduate School Deans, along with their staff, oversee processes and ensure the equitable and appropriate provision of student services. Communication between the Medical and Graduate School programs is strong and all have embraced the goal of increasing efficiency and effectiveness in student services and educational offerings. The Office of Enrollment Servic es bridges the medical and graduate programs to provide support to students in the areas of orientation, admissions, registrar, bursar, financial aid, housing and benefits. The Senior Director of Enrollment Services and Student Information has a global understanding of issues and barriers across programs and works closely with program leaders from each area to ensure that services are provided to students in a timely and effective manner. Student Services departmental managers actively manage all aspects of institutional processes relating to orientation, academic calendar, disability services, handbook policies, emergency management, and health clearance and New York State vaccination requirements. Orientation Upon acceptance, students are given access to orientation and enrollment portals that provide specific information for health clearance, housing, and all pre- matriculation requirements. These websites allow students to engage with their program, manage their information and establish communication to support a smooth transition to ISMMS. The Orientation Committee, comprised of students, faculty and staff from all programs, provides new students with the opportunity to connect with their peers, participate in social activities and acclimate themselves to the community in which they will train. Student Health, Student Mental Health and Disability Officer Services Student Health Services are available to all students, providing physical exams, illness visits, vaccine administration, STI and HIV testing, travel consultation, gynecologic exams, medication refill, and compliance requirements including tuberculosis screening and influenza vaccination. These services are offered free of charge. The Student Mental Health Service offers confidential mental health care to students from all programs. Mental health services are covered in part by student's medical benefits plan as well as a contribution from the School to 52 the Department of Psychiatry for administrative services. The School also supports a disability officer who is available to any student for consultation and who coordinates accommodations in the learning and testing environments. Student Wellness The Student Wellness Committee, comprised of students, faculty and staff, focuses on raising awareness and providing programming about self-care to students in all programs. Featured programming includes Wellness Week, the Wellness Fair and Depression Screening Day. Other informal wellness activitie s include study breaks during board exams, yoga and Pilates sessions as well as free access to the 92nd Street Y gym facility. The School provides a lactation room that offers a quiet, private space for breast- feeding mothers. Housing The Aron Residence Hall, geographically adjacent to the School campus, provides low- cost housing to 855 students. Amenities include a 24-hour doorman, health fitness room, outdoor basketball courts, entertainment lounge, and laundry facilities. Students enrolled in the MD, PhD, and MD/PhD programs are guaranteed housing. With some exceptions, housing is not offered to students enrolled in the Master's degree programs. Housing for couples and families is provided at other properties in the surrounding area that are also owned by Mount Sinai. Technology Services and Learning Support The Academic Informatics and Technology (AIT) Department within the School ensures that all educational programs have access to advanced technology services and learning support systems. AIT staff work closely with the educational program leaders to continuously enhance the learning environment for ISMMS students. For example, all lecture halls and large classr ooms are equipped with the Echo-360 video capture system, which provides students with access to recorded classroom sessions. Lectures, course materials, and online examinations are posted on our Blackboard Content Management system. Course and elective r egistration is offered through an electronic system that allows for remote programming of schedules and educational sessions. Students can make appointments online with the Student Health Service as well as selected advisors and administrators through a platform utilizing the Starfish system. The School gives students access to on-campus and remote academic and support resources. The Levy Library provides online access to journal subscriptions and library search tools, thus providing wide availability to the entire School community. The Levy Library has a staff of seasoned librarians, including a virtual reference librarian available through an online chat system, to answer student questions regarding library resources for their studies and research. The Academic IT Support Center assists students with technology issues through online, phone, or in-person support. Phone support for technology issues is available round the clock. A more extensive description of the Levy Library can be found in Standard 3. 53 Student Advisement The Medical School provides a rich network of advising and mentoring. All students are assigned to a Student Affairs Faculty Advisor who provides academic, personal, and career guidance from orientation through graduation. Advisors offer support, information and referrals to department-specific mentors, and also guide students through the career planning process. Six designated advisors are supported by the Department of Medical Education, and each advisor meets with his or her cohort of students as a group as part of the InFocus curricula (Standard 11), as well as individually. Students sign up for appointments with their advisors through an online scheduling system. To fa cilitate completion of the scholarly project, the Director or Associate Director of the Medical Student Research Office meets with each student during the first semester to help identify a project and mentor. Additionally, students have access to Track Advisors who have knowledge of a student's area of interest and can help the student meet the milestones established to complete the required scholarly project. Students have opportunities to develop close relationships with many other members of the facult y in addition to their Faculty Advisors and Track Advisors. Specialty advisors in each of the major medical specialties are identified for students and are available to meet with students to offer advice and perspective, and assist students in the residency application process. The Office of Student Affairs maintains a Mentor Database, a searchable web -based tool that helps students identify potential advisors and mentors based on specialty interests and advising needs. Currently, the database contains over 200 faculty volunteers across every major specialty. Robust longitudinal programming for career planning and specialty selection includes career panels and specialty fairs, and also sessions on the residency application process, including interviewing, and creating a match list. Additionally, numerous student interest groups host specialty -specific panel discussions and skills sessions, as well as broader themed programming around topics such as women in medicine and primary care careers. The Graduate School also has student advising services in each of it s programs. First -year PhD students are assigned an academic advisor to monitor and assess their progress throughout the program. Upon matriculation, PhD students are required to attend a one- day workshop (supported by multiple New York City graduate programs, including ISMMS) which addresses practical issues students are likely to face during the early stages of their training. Students also select a dissertation advisor, a relationship that is critical for their doctoral experience. In addition to a student's dissertation advisor, students have an Advisory Committee that serves to guide and monitor their thesis progress. Students are required to have a face- to-face meeting with their Advisory Committee at least once a year and three months prior to their dissertation defense in order to obtain clearance to defend their thesis. In addition to mentoring, career development is a very important component of a student's training. The PhD program has ongoing initiatives to ensure that students are exposed to various career paths and start networking early in their training. The program recommends that second - year students meet with their dissertation advisor to discuss possible options and to complete a self-assessment of their individual skills relative to their career goals. Students are then assisted by their dissertation advisor in establishing an Individual Development Plan (IDP) which is a 54 roadmap to acquiring the skills and competencies needed to achieve short- and long- term career objectives. The IDP is a living document which is updated frequently and focuses on concrete career options as students move closer to the end of their training. A Career Day is offered to PhD students in their fourth year and beyond and provides an opportunity to mee t with representatives from the pharmaceutical, biomedical science, financial, consulting, non- profit and academic sectors. Several times each academic cycle, the Graduate School underwrites a career seminar where alumni can meet informally with students and discuss their career paths. Additionally the Graduate School participates with other academic institutions in the metropolitan area in a two -day bi -annual workshop focused on career planning. Each year, ISMMS hosts SINAInnovations, a two -day symposium with an overarching theme of innovations in biomedicine. A subset of the annual program is developed exclusively for students and postdoctoral trainees. SINAInnovations includes a dynamic series of panels, workshops, and a large, popular networking reception. Last year this event focused on team science as a vehicle for innovation and success. Student- led organizations recently launched Sinai Neuroscience Outreach Pr ogram (SNOP) and Students for Equal Opportunity in Science (SEOS ). SNOP aims to promote neuroscience educat ion and encourage an interest in brain research. SEOS focuses on increasing diversity in the sciences, providing support and resources to its members, improving faculty mentoring for students and increasing networking opportunities. Another organization, Women in Science and Medicine (WiSM), advocates for the professional and personal goals of the female medical and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and laboratory technicians. It provides a network of support and mentorship, and fosters an ongoing discussion of concerns and issues specific to career advancement and work -life balance. Each of the Master's degree programs in the Graduate School have advisement and career development capabilities that are tailored to support their respective students. Academic Support The School has strong support services for academic remediation. Students have access to course directors, teaching assistants, Peer Tutors and Senior Tutors, as well as a Learning Specialist who is on retainer for limited sessions e ach year. The Senior Tutor program for medical students is comprised of senior medical or graduate students with particular tutoring interests who receive intensive training in support and tutoring. Students are referred to the Senior Tutors through their advisors, program leaders or the Office of Student Affairs. Procedures for Addressing Student Complaints and Grievances Strictly maintained and fairly implemented ISMMS policies uphold students' rights to voice concerns about mistreatment and other grievances and have them addressed in a supportive manner. Students in both medical and graduate programs can bring concerns about student mistreatment to the Student Mistreatment Resource Panel, a group of students with representation across all programs. The panel serves as a sounding board for students with 55 concerns about mistreatment in the educational environment. Medical students who are finishing a clinical rotation are asked about mistreatment as part of their evaluation of the clerkship site. Students are encouraged to raise concerns to their clerkship directors about any mistreatment. When specific incidents are reported, the Associate Deans of Undergraduate Medical Education discuss the matter with the clerkship director and/or Chair of the departm ent involved. This approach has led to remediation plans for the faculty and house staff involved, and in rare instances resulted in the removal of a faculty member from teaching obligations. The School's Grievance Committee addresses allegations of harassment or abuse brought by any faculty, medical or graduate student, house st aff officer, or postdoctoral research fellow against any other such member of the School community. The composition of this Committee and the procedures for addressing grievances are detailed in the Medical Student and Graduate Student Handbooks as well as in the Faculty Handbook. In addition, Graduate Students can express academic complaints and grievances at the Academic Review Committee. The Associate Deans for Undergraduate Medical Education in the Medical School hold monthly open office hours for students to voice any concerns or make suggestions. These office hours are publicized and are held at times convenient to students. Students can also express their concerns to the Student Council (Standard 4), which has representation across the Medical and Graduate Schools. The Student Council addresses a broad range of issues, including curricular concerns, student services, community service, student health, and social activities. In addition, the Executive Committee of the Student Council meets monthly with the Dean, the Deans of the Medical School and Graduate School, and several Associate Deans to advise the School's leadership of suggestions or concerns on behalf of the student body. These meetings have formal agendas and minutes are recorded and maintained by the Student Council. Student Records The secure maintenance of student records and a clear policy on the release of student information are crucial to providing an environment where students can trust that their information is respected and kept confidential. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) guides these two priorities and is strictly upheld by Enrollment Services staff. The Registrar's Office periodically provides a workshop for select newly hired faculty, administrators and other staff about the requirements under FERPA. FERPA information is also readily available in the Medical School and Graduate School Handbooks. Importantly, students have the right to access their academic record. The policy for access is also listed in the student handbooks with additional information and forms posted on the Registrar's website. Evaluation of Student Services Students have multiple ways to evaluate student services, and changes are often made in response to their feedback. As the direct recipients of support services, students are uniquely equipped to identify strengths and weaknesses of these services and the offices responsible for providing them. 56 Each year, the Student Council works with a select group of students from all programs to craft, administer and analyze a Comprehensive Student Survey for both the medical students and the graduate students. Results are presented to the School's leadership and many substantive changes to support services and other aspects of student life have been made as a result. Beyond qualitative measures of satisfaction, the Comprehensive Student Survey s are a source of qualitative data that inform strategic planning for School operations (Appendix 9-B and Appendix 9-C ). As an example, student survey feedback has led to multiple changes to the Aron Residence Hall, including: restructuring of communication channels between dormitory residents and building employees; streamlining of mainten ance services; creation of monthly meetings between the Real Estate Office, school representatives, and the Student Council; a student- led redesign of the room assignment policy; renovations of shared student spaces (TV room, exercise room, laundry room); and the addition of green initiatives throughout the facility. Other improvements based on student feedback include an online resource for students to place work orders to ease the process of scheduling repairs and an automated system for receiving and being alerted to packages. In addition to changes within the Aron Residence Hall, improvements have also been made with respect to security surrounding the building. The Mount Sinai Security Department and the Real Estate Office have increased the number o f closed -circuit television cameras and the presence of security officers in the areas near Aron Hall to ensure continued student safety. Future surveys and assessment activities will guide further improvements to student housing. The most recent Comprehensive Survey highlighted some institutional issues which the School's leadership continues to address. As noted above, housing is not currently offered to students in the Masters in Biomedical Sciences, Masters in Public Health and Masters and PhD in Clinical Research programs. Although recruitment materials and student handbooks for these programs clearly state that housing is not offered, this remains a source of dissatisfaction for affected students. The AAMC Medical School Graduation Questionnaire (GQ) is a voluntary survey sent to all medical students in the months leading up to graduation and asks about their experiences across all facets of education. It allows for year -to-year comparisons, and for comparison of their own medical school with othe r LCME -accredited medical schools. The response rate at ISMMS is typically around 70%. Recent changes based on feedback from the GQ includes offering additional career planning services (such as creation of the Mentor Database as noted above), identific ation of specific faculty in each department available for residency application counseling, and increased measures for ensuring student confidentiality. In summary, ISMMS provides a comprehensive set of support services to help our students thrive in th e academic setting. Specific programs and services may be modified over time in response to the changing environment and evolving needs, as we strive to offer consistently high quality, relevant support that enhances the student experience and is congruent with our educational mission. 57 Standard 10: Faculty A large, highly qualified faculty teach in and oversee the educational programs of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). These faculty are appropriately trained, receive ample career development support, and thrive in an environment that values academic freedom. Appendix 10-A highlights some key sections of the Self-Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Faculty. 2014 has been a period of extraordinary growth in the size of the ISMMS faculty. As of September 2014, the ISMMS full-time faculty count was 2,753, an increase of approximately 800 since 2013. Although the number of faculty has risen steadily over the past decade, this recent sharp incr ease is attributable largely to the creation of the Mount Sinai Health System and the integration of many new physicians to our teaching, research and clinical programs. Conducting proper review of these new faculty in a relatively short period required extraordinary effort by our faculty Committee on Appointments, Promotions and Tenure (APT) as well as the support of our back offices in shepherding through the transactions. Three positive factors worked in our favor. First, the vast majority of these incoming faculty had academic appointments at other highly regarded medical schools, primarily Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, so that we had a foundation off which to work in evaluating their applications. Second, our highly dedicated APT Committee organized into faculty subgroups to vet all senior candidates prior to approval. Third, we were able to increase the size of the APT administrative office to assist with the extra volume. The full-time faculty is complemented by a voluntary faculty of approximately 2,000 individuals. Many work in nearby physician offices and come to the main campus to teach and/or invite students to their offices for unique outpatient learning experiences. The IS MMS faculty are well trained to perform their duties. 99.8% of our full- time faculty have doctoral degrees, primarily M.D. or Ph.D. degrees; some have two doctoral degrees, with MD/PhD a typical combination. Similarly, 99.5% of our voluntary faculty have doctoral degrees. All have a broad range of expertise that is relevant to their roles as educators, researchers and clinicians, and many have training and experience in multiple areas. All teaching faculty, regardless of rank or full- time status, are he ld to the same standards as educators. Every full- time faculty recruit receives a job description that clearly articulates his/her roles and responsibilities. This helps to ensure that new faculty and their supervisors have a mutual understanding of expectations, and serves as a valuable foundation for future performance reviews. Many ISMMS faculty are expected to teach as a condition for holding their appointments. Approximately 900 faculty teach in one or more of the degree-granting programs. Others may devote their efforts to postgraduate teaching, i.e., postdoctoral research fellows, clinical residents and clinical fellows. Some teach in both degree-granting and postgraduate programs. 58 Teaching faculty roles and responsibilities vary by program. The MD program provides detailed job descriptions (Appendix 10- B) to course directors who teach in the first two years that a ddress all aspects of their role, from syllabus preparation to resource availability to evaluation and assessment strategies. Similarly, clerkship director guidelines cover their broad range of responsibilities, including career guidance, documentation, assessment and faculty development. Another example is the MPH Faculty Handbook , which clearly communicates expectations for faculty teaching and administrative responsibilities. Faculty participate extensively on the standing Executive Curriculum Committee (ECC) of the MD program, which is charged by the ISMMS Dean with: Conducting a continuing review of curriculum design, course organization and teaching performance and formulating specific recommendations for improvement Reviewing the educational objectives of the School of Medicine and to assure a curriculum that is consistent with these objectives Evaluating all segments of the existing curriculum and approving any changes or additions Reviewing the allocation of curriculum time for all subjects through the four years and the associated academic calendar Reviewing all course evaluations, student feedback, AAMC Graduation Questionnaire data and student performance data as outcomes of curricular design and implementation, and using this information to suggest improvements. Working in the best interests of the students and the educational program without regard for parochial or political influences or departmental pressures The Curriculum Steering Committee, the Years 1 & 2 Committee, and the Clinical Curriculum Committee (representing Years 3 & 4 clerkships) all report to the ECC and each has a specific area of focus. ISMMS is committed to sustaining an enriching environment in which our faculty can grow professionally and instruct and support our students in pursuing their academic goals. The following institutional resources and programs illustrate our commitment to optimizing faculty effectiveness. Faculty Handbook The online Faculty Handbook is an important resource for all faculty. As the repository for many policies and procedures, it is heavily utilized by both faculty and administrators. Recently, the Dean's Office created a \"For Faculty\" website to enhance faculty access to policies by offering targeted information to educators, researchers and clinicians. \"For Faculty\" also provides easily accessible information about services and benefits that are not included in the Faculty Handbook. 59 Faculty Appointment, Promotion and Tenure (APT) Methodology The Faculty Handbook describes the criteria for all faculty ranks, and is supplemented by web documents that assist faculty and administrators in understanding the methodology and assembling applications. There are four full- time \"tracks\": Clinician and /or Educator; Investigator; Research; and Clinical Practice. There is some overlap across tracks in terms of types of activities addressed, but every track has its own specific criteria for expected achievement at the ranks of assistant professor, associate professor and professor. Entry- level instructors are not placed in a track, to allow time for them to develop their interests and roles prior to assignment to a track when they are promoted to assistant professor. The APT methodology evolves over t ime in response to changing internal and external conditions. For example, the Clinical Practice Track was introduced in 2011 in recognition of the increasing clinical workload for many of our physicians, and the reduced likelihood that they will have time for scholarly endeavors. The new track provides opportunities for success and advancement for a cadre of faculty who might otherwise have been confined to a junior level in the Clinician and/or Educator Track without hope of meeting criteria for promotion to more senior ranks in that track. The other full- time tracks have also changed with time. For example, all have had criteria added that address innovation. The Clinician and/or Educator Track has been amended to recognize changing teaching modalities such as web -based educational materials that faculty develop. The Investigator Track has undergone the greatest change; previously called the Academic Track (which inadvertently suggested that the other tracks might not be academic in nature), the Investigator Track criteria have been broadened to recognize the increasingly diverse backgrounds of our researchers, who are now recruited not just from academia but also from industry. The broadening profile of our faculty brings new areas of expertise and fresh perspectives that enrich the experiences of our students and hold great promise for pushing the boundaries of science and medicine. Faculty Performance Review Annual performance evaluations are an important part of the ISMMS culture. The evaluation policy for full -time faculty is posted on the School's website, and a standardized template is used by all academic departments (Appendix 10-C ). Because the responsibilities and activities of faculty vary, the assessment instrument allows supervisors to address those relevant to each individual faculty member; the many areas covered include teachi ng, scholarship, research, clinical care, mentoring, service, professionalism and leadership. Within the teaching category, lectures, course development and directorship and mentoring are among the attributes to be considered. Every faculty member is assigned to a primary academic department, and many also have a strong connection to one or more of the multidisciplinary institutes; for faculty who are deeply involved in the activities of both their department and institute, the department Chair and institute Director may both contribute to the evaluation. The annual performance review process provides an important opportunity for faculty to meet with their Chair, Director or Chief for feedback on performance and to plan for the coming year. 60 Support Speci fically for Educators Communication of expectations and assurance of appropriate training for teaching faculty have always been important at ISMMS. With the addition of new training sites for ISMMS medical students at Mount Sinai Health System member ho spitals, the Department of Medical Education devoted months to planning and preparing orientation sessions. At the start of the 2014-2015 academic year, the clerkship leaders at each new training site attended sessions to learn expectations and rules for teaching staff to ensure equivalency across all sites for students' experiences. In addition, five online modules were created for educator faculty at these sites. The modules related to the following topics: an introduction to ISMMS and the curriculum; clerkship-specific information; student and faculty expectations (policies); student resources; and faculty resources. Ongoing programs that promote ISMMS faculty learning and growth as educators include: Life-Long Learning - ISMMS expects that faculty w ho teach in any setting possess up- to- date knowledge in their areas of expertise. Our culture of continuous learning drives faculty to develop their skills and knowledge as researchers and clinicians on an on-going basis. The School sponsors a large Continuing Medical Education program (Standard 13) and departmental grand rounds, has an extensive library collection (Standard 3), provides financial support for travel to conferences, and offers resources to enhance the grant application process. Such support provides faculty with a highly sophisticated understanding of the material they teach, thus creating a strong platform for them to excel as educators. The Institute for Medical Education (IME) - The IME is one of the most visible and active resources supporting the progress and development of educators who fulfill the teaching mission of ISMMS. As one of the School's strategic institutes, the IME serves an integral role in advancing the institution's education agenda. IME membership is open to all medical/health sciences educators. Most members and participants are full -time faculty at ISMMS. Entry -level (\"Associate \") membership is open to all faculty, as well as to postdoctoral research and clinical fellows. There are also two advanced levels of membership - Fellow and Master Educator - for faculty who have demonstrated excellence and have made significant contributions to biomedical education. The IME uses a ri gorous peer review application process for membership. As of 2015, there are 42 Associate members and 67 advanced members across the two levels. Both basic and advanced members have a responsibility to contribute actively to the teaching community. Fellows and Master Educators are integral to the expansion of the IME's infrastructure and scope of programs. The IME's goals are to: - Recognize and reward excellence in education and teaching - The IME sponsors events that highlight the value of education in the life of ISMMS and its associated hospitals and ensure that teaching excellence is recognized and rew arded by the School. Excellence in Teaching Awards are conferred annually to outstanding faculty, staff and students who 61 embody the principles of excellence in teaching and go beyond the call of duty. Winners are selected through a peer -review process, wit h 45 faculty recipients in the past four years. - Encourage educational research - At an annual Educational Research Day, poster presentations showcase the work of faculty, staff and students in the area of educational research, with the twin goals of encouraging all to participate in this important arena and providing a stepping stone to regional and national dissemination of their work. The IME awards the AAMC Medical Education Research Certificate (MERC) to faculty for developing skills in educational research; over the past two years, 13 such awards have been conferred. - Facilitate the academic promotion of educators - Mentoring teaching faculty fosters professional development and educational portfolios. Advanced membership in the IME also provides evidence of outstanding quality and quantity of educational work to the Appointments and Promotions committee. - Support skills development - The IME provides multiple opportunities for faculty to participate in enrichment programs for professional development . A series of peer -led faculty development workshops address a wide variety of topics, including bedside teaching, effective presentation skills in the classroom, and portfolio development. In the past four academic years, IME has held 24 such workshops. - Promote the dissemination of innovative medical education scholarship - The IME sponsors Medical Education Grand Rounds, bi-weekly conferences that provide a forum for ISMMS educators to exchange ideas about curricular innovations, new teaching theories, research in education, use of technology, evaluation methods and mentorship of teachers and learners. Each year there are 12 -14 Grand Rounds, with at least a third of the speakers invited from other institutions to provide a fresh perspective. - Create an educational community whose members inform and support one another- Activities include peer leadership of development workshops, mentorship of junior faculty on education-related projects, and support to present at national educational conferences. Faculty Development In acknowledgment of the importance of faculty development, Dean Charney elevated oversight for faculty development to the full dean level in 2013, and restructured the existing program as the Office of Academic Development and Enrichment (OADE). OADE p rovides guidance and resources for faculty career advancement, and targets junior faculty in particular for assistance. The OADE dean and staff meet monthly with assistant professors to obtain input, identify knowledge gaps and design programming. Key initiatives launched by OADE include: Mentoring Program - Using institutional guidelines established by the faculty development program in 2011, the academic departments have created their own mentoring programs to reflect their unique culture and needs. A Mentoring Leader has been assigned in each department. OADE supports departmental efforts by providing web-based resources for both mentors and faculty, and consults as needed to enhance existing programs. Seminars and Workshops - OADE offers faculty skills training to help faculty achieve their goals. Events have covered a wide range of topics including: 62 - Promotion Methodology/Steps to Success - Conducting successful basic and clinical research - Work -life balance - Scientific writing After each event, a survey is distributed to rate the quality and relevancy. Welcoming New Faculty: - \"Faculty First: Welcome to the Mount Sinai Health System! \" is a bi -monthly luncheon in which faculty recruits are invited to meet and dine with other new colleagues, the ISMMS Dean and the OADE Dean. - Clinical Coach Pilot Program: Currently under discussion with Department Chairs, this program will assign the man y new clinical faculty who join ISMMS each year to a seasoned faculty member or administrator within their own department who can introduce them to institution and the Department. Having a \"go-to\" person for the many questions that newcomers have is expected to facilitate acclimation to the workplace. Encouraging Collaboration - Because networking and collaboration create a community among the faculty and also foster collective success, OADE has created a number of programs to stimulate collaboration. Of particular note is the popular Junior Principal Investigator Club, an informal opportunity for young faculty scientists to meet, talk about their research, exchange ideas and forge collaborations. Resource Awareness - OADE organizes faculty resource fairs to raise awareness about services and resources available to ISMMS faculty. Representatives from many infrastructure groups, from research core facilities to Human Resources to the Appointments, Promotions and Tenure Office set up booths to provide information and field questions. With the establishment of the Mount Sinai Health System, OADE has expanded its mission to include faculty at the member hospitals. Over the past year, OADE has met with each hospital president and faculty members of all ranks to assess needs. Faculty at all sites are now routinely invited to participate in all OADE events, which whenever possible are video- conferenced to accommodate member hospital faculty who cannot take the time to travel from one campus to another. OADE is also identifying faculty to serve on committees to develop programs that address the needs of faculty across the health system. Importantly, these faculty members will also serve as a point of contact for individuals interested in mentorship opportunities. OADE tracks participation in its many programs, and over time will develop mechanisms (beyond its current surveys) to measure its overall impact. Plans include more detailed assessment across the Health System. Women Faculty Progra ms The Women Faculty Group (WFG) is dedicated to advancing the academic success and careers of ISMMS women faculty. Many WFG programs focus on eff ective mentorship and access to resources. Other topics covered by WFG programs include academic advancement and gender - based issues. Program materials are posted on the WFG website to ensure broad dissemination. Several important groups have emerged from the original WFG: 63 Office for Women's Careers (OWC) - A natural outgrowth of the WFG, OWC was formed in 2008 to advance the academic careers of women at ISMMS and to address potential barriers to their success by offering mentoring, networking, advocacy, and educational services. The founding and current OWC director, Sandra Masur, PhD (Professor of Ophthalmology) was recently invited by the NIH Director to present at a workshop at the Office for Research in Women's Health of the NIH on developing national programs for the Advancement of Women in Biomedica l Careers. Women in Science and Medicine (WiSM) - Wi SM was created in 2013 as part of OWC to provide additional resources and efforts enabling and empowering ISMMS women to achieve their professional and personal goals. WiSM partners with other ISMMS r esearch groups to offer skill development programs and support networking and mentorship activities. Annually, WiSM also sponsors at least one keynote lecture - open to the entire ISMMS community - by a prominent external expert. WiSM contains two target ed subgroups: - Women in Science (WiS) - Fosters an ongoing discussion of concerns specific to the early stages of a woman scientist's career in the Graduate School, and extends access to outreach and professional development opportunities. - Women's Network/American Medical Women's Association Chapter at ISMMS - Seeks to create a community of support for women in medicine by providing mentorship and networking opportunities, advancing career development, and engaging in advocacy for women medical stud ents' health. In addition, Sisters in Medicine is an employee resource group that grew from Mount Sinai Health System diversity initiatives. The group serves as a collective voice that brings awareness to issues of concern to women of color at ISMMS, the Health System's member hospitals, and beyond the institution. Diversity Programs Diversity and inclusion are significant drivers for excellence in science and medicine and represent an important focus at ISMMS. Increasing the participation of individuals underrepresented in the medical and scientific professions is a fundamental goal of the School. A breakdown of faculty by gender and race can be found in Appendix 10- D. Established in 1998 under the leadership of Gary Butts, MD (Professor of Pediatrics), the Center for Multicultural and Community Affairs (CMCA) is the diversity center of the I SMMS. With a federal award to create a Center of Excellence of Minority Health at Mount Sinai, CMCA has developed a \"grow our own\" approach to address workforce diversity in academic medicine, focusing on improving the recruitment and retention of junior minority faculty . Towards this end, CMCA created the Faculty Scholars Program (FSP), a highly individualized career-mentoring program for minority junior clinical and basic science faculty at ISMMS. FSP addresses individual development in the areas of research, education and training, service to the community, clinical practice and professional leadership and equips faculty with the necessary tools, information, and resources for success in academic medicine. 64 Since 2002, 61 ISMMS minority faculty and t rainees have participated in FSP, which has six critical components: Individualized Coaching Sessions - Two seasoned career development experts in academic medicine have 1:1 meetings with Scholars to discuss progress, roadblocks, challenges, and accompli shments, and also to monitor all areas of responsibility, including teaching, clinical practice, research and administration. Travel and Tuition - Support is available when applicable. Career Development Workshops - Skill building sessions - both internal and external - focus on areas such as scientific writing, leadership development, and negotiating for success. Senior Faculty Network - FSP participants have access to senior faculty who function as consultants and trusted advisors. Individual Faculty Development Plan - Each Scholar has a workbook to assess specific areas of responsibility, develop and track a career development process, and plan and track meetings with faculty mentors and relevant supervisors. Individualized Just in Time Education - FSP participants have direct access to resources and consultants in the areas of research methods, teaching and curriculum design, and community engagement strategies on as -needed basis. A new challenge is implement ation and integration of minority faculty development programs across the Mount Sinai Health System. In 2014, the Health System launched a new Office for Diversity and Inclus ion (ODI) to integrate and execute best practices for diversity system -wide, and to help drive excellence and innovation in research, education, and health- care delivery. Dr. Butts has been named Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and will lead efforts focusing on: faculty and employee recruitment, retention, and advancement; education and training; research on health care workforce and disparities; youth education programs; community engagement; employees with disabilities; the LGBT community; and supplier diversity. Moving forward, CMCA and ODI will integrate efforts, setting the standard for diversity and inclusion programs within our larger health system. In this regard, the FSP is entering unchartered waters as we now face the distinct challenge o f determining how best to expand and/or replicate the FSP to nearly twice as many minority faculty (approximately 200+) situated in five additional hospital sites across a large metropolitan area without compromising the highly individualized nature and ri chness of the program. In summary, ISMMS has a talented, well prepared faculty who are excellent teachers and mentors. Faculty are supported in their efforts by a vast infrastructure that offers the teaching instruction, continuing education and advisement that faculty need to build and maintain the skills and sense of community that ensure their success as educators. 65 Standard 11: Educational Offerings ISMMS leverages its broad expertise in biomedical research, clinical care, and medical and scientific training to offer a rich variety of educational programs leading to advanced degrees. Every degree -granting program has rigorous, well-developed goals, curricula and expectations of student learning outcomes that are compatible with one or more components of the School's mission of clinical care, education, teaching, research, information dissemination, and community service. Appendix 11- A highlights some key sections of the Self -Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Educational Offerings . Programs utilize a variety of learning settings appropriate to their unique educational goals and to each course, including traditional didactic and interactive small group formats, participatory journal clubs and seminars, and experiential venues such as laboratories, clinical rotations, and research practice. The educational experience of ISMMS students is shaped by the School's commitment to developing new approaches to teaching, facilitating learning, promoting cutting - edge basic research, translating scientific discoveries into improvements in patient care, and identifying new means to enhance the health and educational opportunities of its community. At the same time, the curricula promote lifelong learning, information retrieval and use skills, and professionalism. Each program undergoes regular self-evaluation and is responsible to School leadership, and in some cases, to external professional accreditation bodies. Medical Education To accomplish its educational goals, the four-year course of study leading to the MD degree is designed to integrate core knowledge with clinical competence while promoting critical thinking skills, problem solving strategies, and clinical reasoning. The ultimate goal is summarized in the program mission statement of the Medical School: \" to produce physicians and scientists who are prepared to enter society as informed advocates and activists, able to advance clinical care and science, and capable of promoting change.\" The medical education competencies were defined in 2009, revised in 2012 and a new curriculum was developed and implemented starting with the class of 2017. A full description of the MD Program's Core Competencies can be found in Appendix 11-B. The comprehensive program evaluation and subsequent revision of the curriculum were prompted by the evolving need for physicians to be not merely clinical care-givers but also collaborators, team members, leaders and innovators. A multidisciplinary Curriculum Design Team spent over a year reviewing the curriculum, student outcomes, course evaluations and data from the AAMC Graduation Questionnaire to inform its recommendations and final plan. The curriculum for the MD degree prepares students for the opportunities and challenges of practicing medicine and conducting biomedical research in the 21st Century. It provides students with the analytical tools needed for research, the skills to work in inter-professional teams, a passion for lifelong, self-directed learning, and an appreciation for applying science in the service of society to address disparities locally and globally. Each course, clerkship and elective opportunity has explicit goals and objectives as learning outcomes. Students in the first and second years are also given explicit milestones to accomplish in a timely manner. These 66 milestones facilitate completion of the required scholarly project and help students to explore careers and develop specific interests. Highlights of the MD curriculum include: \"InFocus\" weeks across all four years that provide core curricula in vital topics such as research methods, global health, service learning, leadership, patient safety and quality, and scientific innovation. These immersion experiences bring together outstanding interdisciplinary faculty and emphasize skill development and knowledge application. Mentored clinical, translational, basic, or educational research opportunities that culminate in a required independent scholarly product prior to graduation. The Medical Student Research Office (MRSO) counsels students about research mentors and funding opportunities. Active, small group and team-based learning opportunities that encourage collective problem solving and peer teaching and mentoring; A Longitudinal Clinical Experience (LCE) that partners medical students with patients beginning in Year 1 to enhance patient- centeredness and reflective practice; In addition, the Interclerkship Ambulatory Care Track (InterACT) gives select third -year medical students a unique longitudinal clinical experience grounded in the foundations of ambulatory medicine and chronic illness care. It develops students committed to the prac tice of patient -centered care who are able to navigate health care systems while addressing the social, economic, and cultural factors that impact chronic illness care in an urban setting. Protected half -days of \"Flex -Time\" in Years 1 and 2 for self -direct ed individualized learning, discovery and leadership development; A strong emphasis on service learning and urban primary care that includes participatory opportunities in the community; Opportunities to participate in advanced, mentored international missions that address the health care, education, research, and public health needs of our global community. Roughly one-third of our medical students elect to do a global health experience during their time at ISMMS. Ample time and mentoring for exploration of career choices; Flexible scheduling that can accommodate the addition of a scholarly year; currently 25% of students elect to take a scholarly year between years 3 and 4. Specialty -specific skill- based preparation for supervised practice in residency; and Prestigious \"Distinction in Research\" and \"Distinction in Medical Education\" opportunities for graduates. The new curriculum expands the number of available elective weeks from 21 to 28 in years 3 and 4, creating time for enhanced learning experienc es that allow students to explore areas of specific interest. Detailed descriptions of the current and future third and fourth year clinical rotations can be found on the School's website . Similarly, the revised MD curriculum affords individualized learning opportunities for Year 1 and 2 medical students through Nexus Learning, which comprises a diverse range of non-clinical courses aligned with the mission and vision of the School. A variety of degree -granting programs provide opportunities for additional training. These include: 67 Patient Oriented Research Training and Leadership (PORTAL) is a 5 -year, MD/MS in Clinical Research program that offers advanced coursework, mentorship, and projects to help prepare medical students for careers in clinical research; Dean's Scholars in Global Health program (DSGH) is a 5 year, MD/MPH program that offers advanced coursework, mentorship, and field experiences to help prepare medical students for careers in global health. Alternatively, medical students can earn an MPH as part of the 4 - year MD curriculum. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences The programs under the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences umbrella include both PhD and Master's programs. These integrated programs within the Graduate School give graduate students abundant opportunities to appreciate and engage in translational science and expose them to course availability outside of the pro gram in which they are enrolled. PhD Program PhD students can earn their degree in Biomedical Sciences or Neuroscience. All entering PhD students in Biomedical Sciences or Neuroscience must fulfill general program requirements that provide a solid foundation in core scientific knowledge. Most students take a Biomedical Sciences (BMS) core course to obtain a highly integrated academic introduction to the first year of the PhD program. The course, which was revised in 2010, spans the major topics of the biomedical sciences including cell biology, cell physiology, metabolism, genetics and genomics, developmental and stem cell biology, immunology, microbiology, model systems, and disease. It is divided into six modules, each with a self -contained set of 25 lectures. Every module is taught by a team of four to six professors. In 2010, BMS underwent a comprehensive evaluation by the Graduate School Curriculum Committee. The evaluation in cluded student evaluations, course director assessment, and teaching faculty feedback. Through this process, several areas of needed improvement were identified. These included: Students and faculty felt there was too much overlap between BMS courses and other courses in the curriculum. Some content specialization was not sufficient and seemed out of place in a general knowledge core curriculum. Students and faculty felt the course extended too far into the summer and interfered with students laboratory rotations Students felt there wasn't adequate coherence within the course. In response, the Associate Dean of the Graduate School charged the Course Director with proposing changes which were later reviewed by the Curriculum Committee. Changes were implemented that addressed all of the concerns. The Curriculum Committee has re- evaluated the BMS course on an annual basis to confirm the success of the course revisions. 68 After their first year of training, PhD students select one of nine Multi- Disciplinar y Training Areas (MTAs) The MTAs are aligned and integrated with the School's interdisciplinary Institutes, which provide collaborative research opportunities and teaching enhancement for faculty, and also provide shared resource facilities and other infrastructure to support the School's clinical, research and educational missions (Standards 2 and 3). The focused thematic groups within the Institutes enable students to interact and identify with broadly based, translational faculty. Each MTA also provides specialized advanced coursework. Individual MTA -led courses are open to students from other MTAs, ensuring that students can pursue interests outside of their specialty. Students also benefit from course offerings, journal clubs and seminars of their respective Institute. The MTA structure has been appealing to students. The School seeks to offer each student many ways of developing a personalized program of pre-doctoral training that meets individual goals in research and academics. In addition t o formal classroom learning and participation in journal clubs and seminars, every student has up to four laboratory rotations that expose them to a wide range of research areas and potential mentors in the ISMMS community. Students must pass an initial qualifying exam early in their second year and then develop and defend their thesis proposal within the following year. Each student is expected to develop a research project that he/she conducts under the guidance of one or more faculty members. That project culminates in a thesis that is presented and defended. The maximum time allowed for the completion of the PhD program is seven years, although the average time to completion is five and a half years. In recognition of the changing employment trends in the biomedical sciences, the PhD program has begun recruiting candidates with more diverse educational backgrounds including engineering, computer science and physics, and has begun to prepare students for a more diverse spectrum of job options. This is a growing trend throughout the country in recognition that a diverse scientific workforce breeds more impactful research and that there is a real need to diversify career paths for our students. The Des ign, Technology and Entrepreneurship (DTE) MTA was introduced in Fall 2013 in response to the changing options our students will face. This training area focuses on the development of innovative technologies, models, designs, techniques and methods that have the potential to substantially advance biomedical research by infusing it with principles and concepts from the quantitative sciences. Within one year, five students had chosen DTE as their training area and are now participating in this new novel curriculum. The scope of Mount Sinai Innovation Partners (MSIP) was broadened to facilitate bringing students' ideas to fruition by guiding them through the processes associated with patenting and intellectual property. Another example of how program evaluation informs improvement and planning efforts was the recent commissioning by the Dean of the Graduate School of an External Advisory Board (EAB) in the summer of 2014. Charged with reviewing the PhD and MD/PhD programs, the EAB found both ISMMS programs to be robust, with a strong track record in recruitment and retention, programmatic requirements and student outcomes. The EAB made several recommendations that the Graduate School is planning to implement, including: 69 Creating a career office to dissemi nate opportunities in the marketplace and to work one-on- one with graduates on their specific career needs Developing more mini-courses in a \"boot camp\" format to meet new and emerging needs of doctoral students Utilizing PhD alumni to serve as ambassador s for recruitment purposes The Graduate School leadership is utilizing the EAB's insights to develop PhD curricular enhancements. It is also planning to increase the visibility and name recognition of the Graduate School in order to attract more exceptio nal students, especially those who are underrepresented in science. In May 2013, the School signed an affiliation agreement with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to foster collaboration on educational programs, research and the development of new diagnostic tools and treatments. This unique affiliation combines Mount Sinai's biomedical expertise with RPI's renowned proficiency in engineering and invention prototyping. A joint online course, Introduction to Experimental Design, was introduced by RPI in Fall 2014 and taken by four ISMMS students. A second course, The Biology of Aging, will be offered in Spring 2015. In addition, ISMMS reserves five slots for RPI students in its Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). SURP, a 10 -week internship program that offers undergraduates an intensive research training experience working in a Mount Sinai basic science laboratory, is an important pipeline for the PhD and MD/PhD programs at ISMMS. Master of Biomedical Sciences The Master of Biomedical Sciences (MSBS) program addresses the nationally recognized need for generalist graduate study in the medical sciences by providing students with the foundation necessary to pursue a variety of careers in the health professions. MSBS graduates pursue doctoral degrees in research and/or clinical medicine, or seek employment in a related field. The first year of the MSBS program focuses on mastery of fundamenta l concepts in cellular and molecular biomedical sciences, application of statistical principles to experimental design and data analysis, responsible conduct of research, and critical analysis and presentation of primary research literature in the biomedic al sciences. Students attend core courses with first- year PhD students and thus share their academic and social environment. MSBS students spend a significant amount of time on a laboratory research project that becomes the basis for their Master's thesis project. MSBS students can also take courses in the Design, Technology and Entrepreneurship MTA, either as a defined track leading to the development of a product for potential commercialization or as electives. MSBS students complete the degree require ments in three terms, with an option to continue their research for a fourth term. Master of Science and PhD in Clinical Research The Master of Science in Clinical Research (MSCR) is a two -year program which provides outstanding clinical and postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty, and other trainees (MD, MD/PhD, and \"basic sci ence\" PhD students) with the knowledge, skills, and experience to launch successful clinical and/or translational research -intensive careers. Students develop 70 competencies in clinical research methodologies, including the design, implementation and presen tation of clinical research, biostatistical data analysis, epidemiology, research ethics, socio -behavioral health, grant writing and the application of basic science techniques in clinical research. MSCR students complete a combination of formal graduate courses, research practicum, works- in-progress/clinical research seminars, and thesis -related work. The PhD in Clinical Research is a 66 -credit program which is designed for outstanding students who desire an intense educational experience to prepare them for a career in clinical or translational research. This program provides a strong didactic foundation combined with a mentored clinical research experience leading to a doctoral degree in Clinical Research. The PhD in Clinical Research emphasizes more advanced topics in biostatistics and experimental design and requires trainees to choose from among four areas of research concentrations including, bench to bedside; clinical trials; implementation research; and molecular genetics and genomics. These con centrations further inform additional select coursework pertaining to the area of concentration. All students are required to pass a written qualifying exam and successfully defend their dissertation work in order to be awarded a PhD in clinical Research. Master of Public Health The Master of Public Health (MPH) program offers training in public health research and practice. The MPH program is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) and is a founding member of the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH). The MPH program educates students about disease prevention, environmental protection and health promotion in partnership with the populations they serve. MPH students can focus their studies in one of several tracks: Health Promotion and Disease Prevention; Global Health; Epidemiology; Health Care Management; Occupational and Environmental Biostatistics; Outcomes R esearch. Students undertake didactic coursework, a practicum experience, and a Master's thesis or Capstone project that demonstrate a knowledge base in the core competencies of public health. MPH graduates pursue careers in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, departments of health, international organizations and industry, and work in basic public health practice, management, education and research. Master of Science in Genetic Counseling The Master of Science in Genetic Counseling (MGC) program prepares students for careers as genetic counselors. The program is accredited by the Accreditation Council of Genetic Counseling (ACGC) and harne sses Mount Sinai's considerable expertise in the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology. The MGC curriculum is taught largely by faculty from these areas and promotes genetic counseling that is sensitive to all cultural and age groups, research, and the intellectual motivation to create lifelong learners. In addition to a robust didactic curriculum, the MGC program includes clinical rotations, practicum experiences, and a required thesis project. Upon completion of the program, MGC graduates are eligible for board certification by the American Board of Genetic Counseling. 71 Master of Science in Health Care Delivery Leadership The School's newest program, the Master of Science in Health Care Delivery Leadership (MHCDL), was launched in 2014 in recognition of the rapidly changing health care environment. The program is designed for mid- career health care professionals and provides them with the skills, knowledge, and strategic tools required to successfully navigate the health care landscape. This rigorous and unique 21-month program is delivered through an online learning platform (Standard 13), with two residency seminar sessions on the Mount Sinai campus. Students are exposed to case studies with relevance and immediate applicability to their workplaces, and conduct a detailed Improvement Project either at their home institution or at another ins titution as part of a team. Personal leadership development experiences are threaded throughout the program. Students receive mentoring from faculty and other participating professionals, and have access to the vast resources and expertise of the Mount S inai Health System. There are eight students in the program's first cohort. A list of courses including credit hours and sequencing for this new program is shown in Appendix 11-C. The program is delivered on a cohort basis (all students take the same cou rses at the same time) with thirteen of the fifteen courses delivered online in a blended synchronous-asynchronous format. Online courses take seven weeks to complete, with an exception of the first, two week Affordable Care Act course, and will be sequenc ed one at a time. Two of the courses will be delivered as part of an in-person, five day residency session; one in the beginning of the program and one that bridges into the second year. The program has a series of learning competencies that are modeled on peer -reviewed published research conducted on competency assessment within health care management degree programs. Specific program competenci es can be found in Appendix 11-D Significant attention was paid to developing the Program Evaluation Plan for this new program (Appendix 11-E) to be sure it met the same standards as other programs in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, but also included a strong assessment of the distance learning elements. The Program Director will aggregate assessment r esults to evaluate student attainment of learning goals and program effectiveness. Gaps will be addressed in consultation with the program leadership and faculty. Additionally, evaluation results will be shared with the Dean of the Graduate School and the Chair of the Department of Health Policy on an annual basis to ensure comparability of quality across Graduate School programs and program effectiveness. The Program Evaluation Plan includes student tracking in each course, monitoring of course- to- course progress and program completion, and student surveys (course, exit, and post-graduation) as general methods for monitoring overall student progress and achievement. Student learning assessment is an aggregation of data from course specific evaluations wh ich directly relate to specific course learning goals that are, in turn, mapped to the competencies desired of all students in the program. The assessments for this graduate student audience are consistent with the types of assessments used in other gradua te programs by being heavily geared toward individual paper assignments, case study analysis, annotated bibliographies, organizational assessments, and other project -based work. 72 Dual Degree Programs ISMMS offers several options for students to pursue more than one degree simultaneously. The prestigious NIH- funded Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) is a joint MD -PhD program that prepares students to be physician- scientists capable of leading th e translation of basic science discoveries into new approaches to disease prevention and treatment. The Dean's Scholars in Global Health Program is a five year program that accepts two students from each MD class to earn an MPH degree in addition to the MD . Five students in each MD class are selected to participate in the Patient- Oriented Research Training and Leadership (PORTAL) program. Students enrolled in the PORTAL program earn both the MD and MSCR degrees over a five-year period. Tuition is waived for the Masters degree in both the Dean's Scholars in Global Health and the PORTAL program. Students who are not accepted to either program can also choose to pursue a Masters degree but are expected to pay tuition. Transfer Policies Unlike undergraduat e education, the transfer of credits at the graduate level is uncommon. Medical students at ISMMS are only accepted as transfer students in extremely rare cases with the approval of the Associate Dean of Student Affairs and the Dean for Medical Education. Graduate School programs have policies pertaining to graduate- level transfer credits that uphold the academic integrity of the School. As indicated under Standard 8 , credits for graduate courses taken at other institutions may be awarded under certain conditions but must be approved by the Program Director and the Dean of the Graduate School. Approval is based on analysis of the course content taken at the other institution in comparison to the course content of the related ISMMS course. The Graduate School Handbook contains a full description of transfer credit policies. Information Literacy ISMMS values and facilitates the development of excellent information literacy skills. The Academic Informatics and Technology (AIT) department oversees the School's library and Academic IT Support Center and ensures that all ISMMS students can access and utilize information and technology resources to support their academic endeavors. The Levy Library offers web -based tutorials, and conducts regular workshops highlighting various research tools and maintains a high caliber of onsite and online research resources. Librarians are available to meet with users individually or in groups for assistance with information resources and research tools. A team of instructional designers, instruc tional technologists and medical illustrators comprise the Instructional Technology Group (ITG), which promotes best practices for integrating technology into teaching and learning. The ITG provides individual and group training for faculty and staff upon request. The AIT department also hosts a monthly \"Lunch and Learn\" series that highlights innovative uses of instructional technology in education. The ITG team maintains the School's Blackboard learning management system, an integral teaching and coll aboration tool for faculty and students. Courses have a site on Blackboard for posting syllabi, class schedules, instructional content and lecture recordings, competencies, 73 assessment methods, and bibliographies. The use of Blackboard by instructors has been mandated for all programs to ensure that students can consistently access course materials. Educational Program Assessment The Medical School and the programs in the Graduate School all evaluate the admission processes, curricula and student learning outcomes on a regular basis, using a variety of approaches and mechanisms. All programs have active and engaged Curriculum Committees that report findings and recommendations to a broader Steering Committee or other executive level oversight group. Some (the MD, MPH and MSGC) have additional expectations associated with their professional accreditation agencies. Evaluation of faculty effectiveness is an important component of program assessment. Rigorous criteria, including student feedback, ensure that educators are facilitating student learning as expected. Examples of effective programmatic assessment were threaded throughout this section to further demonstrate the School's commitment to regular evaluation and improvement. 74 Standard 13: Related Educational Activities Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) has a variety of educational programs that do not lead to the awarding of degrees. All of the programs have in common a commitment to providing high quality expe riences that train participants to master a particular field of knowledge. These programs are summarized under this Standard. Appendix 13- A highlights some key sections of the Self- Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements for Rela ted Educational Activities. Certificate Programs ISMMS has two credit bearing Certificate programs, the Clinical Research Training Program (CRTP) and the Advanced Certificate in Public Health . The CRTP is a 26 credit hour program typically completed within one year. The program provides the basic knowledge and skills for conducting patient oriented clinical and translational research. It is designed for young investigators, clinical research coordinators and other trainees who wish to advance their careers in clinical research by fostering critical thinking and improving analytical skills. The CRTP curriculum is based on the first year didactic component of the Master of Science in Clinical Research program (see full description in Standard 11). The Advanced Certificate in Public Health is a 13 -15 credit hour program completed within one year. Students choose from three concentrations of study: general public health, global health or outcomes research. The certificate program covers publi c health core content and provides a foundation for practitioners, researchers, and other trainees who are interested in enhancing their public health skillset. While enrolled in the certificate program, students may only register for a maximum of 15 credits in the courses outlined in the advanced certificate program curriculum. The admissions and application review processes for both the CRTP and the Advanced Certificate in Public Health follow the same standards as our other degree granting programs. Information about eligibility, application process and curriculum is available on the program websites for both matriculated and prospective students. Once admitted, certificate students have access to all of the support services offered to students in other degree granting programs. Because courses required for our certificate programs are also part of other degree granting programs, they benefit from the design, administration and evaluation rigor of all of our courses. Students receive academic credit for courses taken in the certificate programs. If they later apply for and are accepted to the respective full Master's degree program, the earned credits from the certificate program will be counted toward the degree. Graduate Medical Education Under the auspices of ISMMS, the Consortium for Graduate Medical Education oversees 230 residency and fellowship programs at 17 participating institutions in New York City and New Jersey; approximately 2400 residents and fellows fall under the Consortium umbrella. The Office 75 ensures the quality of house staff and clinical fellow training, including resident responsibilities, evaluations and quality of patient care. It also supports programs to enhance the educational experience of trainees throughout the Consortium. GME functions under the leadership of the Senior Associate Dean for Graduate Medical Education, who reports directly to the Dean for Medical Education. The Senior Associate Dean role was established after the creation of the Mount Sinai Health System to p rovide an extra level of oversight for the many programs of member hospitals. The incumbent is an experienced, widely respected GME expert who directed residency programs at Health System member hospitals for many years. Associate Deans for GME at key training sites are responsible for programs at their respective hospitals and report up to the Senior Associate Dean. Together, they work with trainees and program directors to provide excellent residency education. Administering the GME program of the integrated Mount Sinai Health System requires maintaining appropriate and strategic clinical training sites for postgraduate medical education programs while ensuring that our patients have the best possible outcomes. Programs that previously existed on mul tiple campuses are being located at particular sites. The System brings new clinical training opportunities for residents. Residents and fellows also get first-hand experience in learning about this new health care delivery system. Standardizing the app roach to certain diseases across campuses is a priority. Mount Sinai's GME program adheres to all requirements set forth by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Initial accreditation was granted to the Consortium in 1996, and the program has been continuously accredited since that time. The current accreditation period, effective October 1, 2012, is for five years. Continuing Medical Education Life-long learning is a central principle of the ISMMS educational philosophy. This commitment to the importance of continuous education is echoed by many medical specialty boards, which require ongoing training for their physicians. The Page and William Black Post Graduate School for Continuing Medical Education (CME) focuses primarily on the ongoing education of practicing physicians, but also serves other medical professionals. CME courses are designed both for skill building and to ensure that practit ioners remain up- to-date in their areas of expertise. Mount Sinai's CME program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), and abides by all requirements of this national accrediting agency, including their guidel ines for course organization, faculty, commercial sponsorship, evaluation, etc. As an accredited program, the ISMMS Post Graduate School can offer CME \"credits\" that enable participating physicians to fulfill their annual CME requirements. The program was recently reaccredited for six years rather than the usual four because we received \"Accreditation with Commendation\" for exemplary performance. Mount Sinai's CME programs are open not only to Mount Sinai faculty and staff, but also to practitioners from other institutions. Courses cover a wide range of topics in many medical 76 specialties. Courses may be as intimate as internal departmental grand rounds, or as expansive as a multi-day course that attracts thousands of participants. Course venues may be on-campus or off- site, and may include live webcasts. The CME program comes under the purview of the Associate Dean for Continuing Medical Educati on, who reports directly to the Dean for Medical Education. The Associate Dean is responsible both for adherence to ACCME requirements and for program quality. Participant evaluations are shared with Course Directors and become part of the permanent fil e for a course; performance is reviewed by the Associate Dean to ensure that all programs offered are of the highest quality and accomplish intended goals. During calendar year 2013, ISMMS sponsored 328 CME- approved activities totaling approximately 4,000 hours of instruction. They included live events, regularly scheduled series (such as clinical grand rounds) and enduring materials. Together these activities accommodated nearly 63,000 physician participants and 20,000 non- physician participants. Offic e of Postdoctoral Affairs ISMMS has a large complement of postdoctoral research trainees, and the numbers are growing as the School's research activities continue to expand. Currently, 628 postdoctoral fellows are engaged in hands-on research training in the School. Postdoctoral fellowships provide a stepping stone to careers in academic biomedicine or in industry. Postdoctoral fellows are recruited by individual investigators to work and learn in their research laboratories and programs. Trainees are recruited by mentors on the basis of shared research interests and relevant experience. ISMMS postdoctoral fellows come from doctoral programs in the United States and around the world, creating a very diverse group of trainees. The Office of Postdoctoral Affairs within the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences provides oversight and support for research trainees. A faculty Program Director works closely with an advisory committee com prised of faculty and postdoctoral fellows. A Postdoctoral Executive Committee led by two trainees meets monthly with other fellows to identify concerns that need to be communicated to the advisory committee for disposition. The broad range of services offered by the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs includes: Sponsorship of Academic Programs - The highly acclaimed Responsible Conduct in Research course guides trainees on integrity relating to all aspects of research. Career Planning and Support - Job fa irs, meet -and-greets and career discussions are designed to identify options and provide assistance. Support for New Trainees - Incoming trainees may obtain immigration assistance, housing assistance (housing is offered for up to three years through Mount Sinai's Real Estate Department), medical benefits guidance, etc. Networking and Socials - Regularly scheduled informal events provide an opportunity for trainees to meet each other and faculty. 77 Trouble Shooting - The Office is a resource for trainees who experience difficulties with their mentor, peers or others. Distance Education ISMMS launched its first (and currently only) distance education program, a Master of Science degree in Health Care Delivery Leadership (MSHCDL), in August of 2014. The program provides a coherent, quality- based educational experience that meets the same high academic standards expected of other educational programs at the School. Mission Congruence and Rationale (also see Standard 11) Mount Sinai's multifaceted mission statement connects our desires to lead in patient care, education, research, scholarship, community, and workplace. This new degree program reinforces our commitment to advancing our mission and is a logical outgrowth of the programs and health care delivery activities already in place. The program provides direct access to leaders in health care reform, a world -class faculty from our integrated health system (the largest in NY state), and Mount Sinai's newly- launched Accountable Care Organization. Assessme nt of Program Quality, Consistency, and Coherence The Program Evaluation Plan (see Appendix 11-E and discussion in Standard 11) is comprehensive and encompasses program vision and goals, student services, e- learning management system and instructional res ources, faculty support and training, student learning outcomes and faculty effectiveness. Given the newness of the program and the distance learning format, care was given to be sure faculty members would have the support and input from a professional I nstructional Designer, a Media Specialist, a Curriculum Assistant, and the Program Director so that courses had the expected level of academic depth and rigor, as well as appropriateness to the institution's chosen learning management system (Blackboard). The Blackboard management system has multiple features to facilitate the student learning outcomes assessment process including: a multi- faceted grading center with \"customizable\" recording templates with calculations and rubrics, a retention center that tracks 4 key indicators (deadlines, grades, activity, and access), and a portfolio tool enabling the collection and recording of multiple assessments of student's work. Course instructors operate under a set of instructional guidelines including a defined number of instructor-led hours, use of discussion boards moderated by the instructor, use of weekly synchronous web conferencing, scheduled office hours dedicated to students of this program, instructor-provided weekly course synthesis, and expectations of communication frequency and assessment feedback to students. The guidelines also require that faculty establish criteria for 78 formal assessment of student interactions with the instructor and peers (e.g., grading the quality of discussion board posts). The Program Evaluation Plan includes multiple ways to assure the Program Director can assess interactions including the student learning outcome process, course surveys, instructor feedback, and having full access to each online course to monitor activity. Appropriate Level of Resources The School has made significant investments to ensure the support and success of the MSHCDL online program including: A full -time, dedicated Administrative Director A full -time, dedicated Program Coordinator A full -time, dedicated Instructional Designer A full -time, dedicated Media Specialist A full -time, dedicated Curriculum Assistant Internal and external faculty (including project mentors) Student Service Support help desk, including technological services An updated electronic management learning system (Blackboard) with additional supports and applications Faculty training and on-going support to deliver online curriculum The resources required to support this new program have been incremental and do not impact the support available for other academic programs. Since this is primarily an online program, the burden on ISSMS's physical plant facilities is minimal and the in -person residency sessions are held during the summer months when demand for educational space is lower. Student Services Consistent with the offerings made available to students in the traditional setting, the Enrollment Services Office coordinates many of the services that are offered to students in the MSHCDL program including admissions, financial aid, and registration, a s well as access to the Disability Officer (Also see Standards 8 and 9). As a program within the domain of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, the Graduate School Student Handbook is the primary source of information for MSHCDL students. Learning Resources Students are provided access to a variety of digital resources including student services and course content. Our intent is to create a virtual experience that connects the learner to ISMMS and on-campus student life. Students have full access to the Gustave L. and Janet W. Levy Library which supports clinical, educational, and research programs at ISMMS through its reference and instructional services and by providing access to an extensive digital collection of biomedical information resources (Also see Standards 3, 7 and 9). Specific to the MSHCDL program, the Levy Library resources 79 include the Ebsco Business Source Complete, a premier business database containing the Harvard Business Review and many marketing, management and business sources. Students also have access to the Health Policy Reference Center which includes more than 400 e-journals on the topics of health care access and delivery, administration, financing, quality, reform and public health. The School recently moved to a hosted solution by Blackboard that provides additional licenses and improved reliability across the enterprise. In recognition of the importance of quality media elements in an online environment, course content is carefully designed to enhance the experience of a distance learner while ensuring their learning experience mirrors an on -campus experience. Faculty Support Academic IT specialists and librarians provide orientations to faculty about library resources and research services, computing services, and Blackboard . An additional special set of intensive Blackboard training sessions, designed by the program's Instructional Designer, are offered to MSHCDL faculty and teaching assistants on both a group and individual basis. These sessions provide in- depth counsel on migrating learning material to a digital environment and adopting select features to support course learning objectives, assessments, and collaborative engagement of students and faculty. Multiple individual follow- up occurs as needed. Faculty and teaching assistants are also assisted by an instructional technologist with course design and selection of technology that will create a positive experience for the distance learner. The School hired a full- time digital Media Specialist to support the faculty by facilitating recordings, encoding to a variety of codecs, providing training on best practices in lecture presentations, and ensuring media is tagged and m etadata is accurate within the content storage system. More routine follow-up is provided through in-person instructional sessions, online tutorials, and remote consultations. Support is also provided by email, phone, online, or via videoconferencing 7 days per week. An annual assessment of the faculty support program will be conducted and will include the participation of faculty and key academic IT staff involved in providing support. More frequent adjustments occur as a result of weekly meeting discussion between the Program Director and Academic IT staff. In recognition of the need to be responsive to relevant substantive concerns, continual changes will be made based on frequent feedback from the program faculty and students. Periodic Assessment o f Resource Impact ISMMS provided an ample budget to launch and maintain the MSHCDL program. The School's annual budget process provides an opportunity to assess the results of the Program Evaluation Plan (Appendix 11-E) in the context of program's impact on human, fiscal, and infrastructure resources and re- allocate resources to best match on -going needs. 80 Legal and Regulatory Compliance Credit Hours The program adheres to the New York State Department of Education regulations concerning credit hour definitions (Commissioner's Regulation 50.1 (o)). See Appendix 11-C for a full listing of courses, credits and sequencing. On Boarding Student Identity Verifications Upon matriculation to ISMMS, all students undergo a detailed background check which is conducted by Corporate Screening Services, Inc. and includes verification of key identity and background information. Students are then issued a unique life number that serves as their student ID number. This ID/life number is also found on the photo badge issued by the Security Department. Student identity is matched at the time of issuance. The ID/life number is used by the School's IT division to issue credentials for accessing email, School's network, and online services including Blackboard . This initial process is designed to ensure integrity of student identity and key information up to the point of course access. Course-Level Student Identity Verifications ISMMS has employed the Acxiom Identify -X TM solution provided by LearningHouse, to assure student identity authentication in courses. This product uses a database of publicly available and nonpublic proprietary records to verify student identities and then generates challenge questions on demand, without prior input from students. This ensures students cannot share their responses and circumvent the identity verification process. This solution is compatible with our learning management system, Blackboard , and is deployed randomly at multiple times in each course. Each course has weekly synchronous sessions that provide an opportunity for faculty to match student images against their student identification pictures. This approach is effective since most of the course level assessment activity in this program will be unique project-based work, not examinations. The program will regularly evaluate the effecti veness of the onboarding process and Acxiom solution as part of its annual program evaluation. The Program Director will solicit feedback from Academic IT, program faculty, and students identify any gaps or process issues. There are no fees charged to stu dents for identity verification. The comprehensive nature of the program's development and planned evaluation processes, which were created in line with ISMMS's standards of academic excellence, demonstrate that the MSHCDL program's offerings meets the f undamental elements for Distance Education in Standard 13. 81 Standard 14: Assessment of Student Learning Ongoing assessment of students, academic programs, and teaching faculty is integral to ensuring fulfillment of the ISMMS educational mission. In addition to the comprehensive overview of assessment of student learning provided in this section, Standard 14, relevant information is also contained in Standards 7, 8, 10 and 11; together, these sections describe assessment at the level of student, faculty, alumni, overall curriculum, teaching methods, learning environment, program goals, and institutional leadership. Appendix 14-A highlights some key sections of the Self-Study report that address the Middle States Fundamental Elements relating to Assessment of Student Learning. Data collection and analysis for assessment purposes begin within each individual program, and are also conducted for the Graduate School and MD programs as a whole, and overall for ISMMS. All facets of the assessments are aggregated to create a complete picture of successes and shortcomings. Observations and recommendations made at each level feed back to each program to inform programmatic change, thus contributing to the evolution of our programs. Considerable diversity in assessment approaches is evident across programs, reflecting the individual needs of each program and the disparate educational needs of the students in each program. Some programs require a curriculum that is tailored to each individual student, e.g., the PhD Program, while others have a more unified curriculum that is at least partially mandated by an outside regulatory body, e.g., Master of Science in Genetic Counseling or MD Program. Appendix 14-B summarizes each program's goals, assessment methods, outcome measures, and action plans to address weaknesses, and provides a guide to the overall processes. In all cases, student assessment, including adherence to program timelines for academic achievement (Appendix 14-C ), and program assessment are evaluated by an oversight group/com mittee and feedback is provided to Course Directors and program leadership. Doctor of Medicine Program The innovative curriculum of the MD program trains students to become highl y skilled physicians and compassionate caregivers. Assessments are grounded in defined guidelines and provide evidence that ISMMS students successfully meet both internal and national graduation competency requirements. Learning outcomes are based upon the requirements of the Liaison Committee for Medical Education (LCME), the national organization that accredits Doctor of Medicine programs. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies for residents (the next training step for medical school graduates) are also taken into consideration. In order for students to progress through the MD program, they must complete each year's requirements. These requirements are tracked to ensure they are met by each student. Year 1 medical students must pass all courses and complete their milestone requirements to progress to Year 2 82 Year 2 medical students must pass all courses, complete their milestone requirements and successfully complete the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE ) Step 1 before progressing to Year 3 Year 3 medical students must pass their Year 3 clerkships and complete all milestones to progress to Year 4 Year 4 medical students must pass their clerkships, complete their milestones and pass USMLE Step 2 Clinical S kills and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge to graduate. The curriculum is developmentally structured and requires that students demonstrate adequate knowledge and skills in order to progress to subsequent years. While each course and clerkship has subject -speci fic goals and objectives, global competencies, e.g., communication skills, professionalism, self-directed learning, are threaded throughout the curriculum. Course and clerkship directors conduct assessments that assure these objectives are met. They review their course or clerkship goals, objectives, curriculum, teaching formats and assessments to confirm that they are consistent with the overarching graduation competencies and that they facilitate advancement through medical school. A variety of modalities for assessment of student learning are used throughout the MD program, including: multiple choice and modified short answer essay examinations; practical exams; assessment of small group performance; direct observations with real and standardized patie nts; chart reviews; and, oral and written case presentations and performance at simulators. The assessments are complementary, using multiple, additive modalities in an ongoing fashion to assess student outcomes. In addition, our assessments correlate with student achievement of national standards as documented by the USMLE Step 1, Step 2 Clinical Knowledge and Step 2 Clinical Skills and successfully completing the first year of residency training. In the aggregate, the results of these assessments provide convincing evidence that students achieve the required competencies. At each stage of the MD program, learning outcomes are evaluated through a variety of measures that include: Collecting and tracking pass/fail rates for each course and clerkship, and longitudinally tracking each graduating class for their performance in specific content areas, e.g., Anatomy, Pathophysiology, Internal Medicine, on USMLE examinations to assess competency in these specific areas. This information is reviewed with course and clerkship directors to inform changes to the curriculum. Monitoring of students who need to retake exams or repeat courses. Although grades are pass/fail in Years 1 and 2, the Student Affairs Manager tracks students with marginal performance or failing grades and implements remediation when required, as described in Standard 9. Within Student Affairs, a network of Student Support personnel review students with marginal performance, creating integrated, individualized educational plans for them with continuous feedback and reassessment. Thresholds are defined to identify when students are reviewed by the Promotions Committee for more extensive remediation plans. Tracking by Student Affairs of student incident reports. Multiple incident reports or a sing le egregious event prompting an incident report will result in a review of the student by the Promotions Committee. 83 Conducting comprehensive clinical assessments (COMPASS 1 and 2) at the end of the second and third years to identify student achievement of the specific goals for each segment of the program as well as preparedness for the next phase. These exercises utilize standardized patients to assess application of knowledge, skills and attitudes, including communication, clinical skills, ethical reason ing, and professionalism. Comparing student performance in clerkships across all training sites. Analyzing grade components by location allows us to ensure comparable educational and assessment experiences for students regardless of the training site. Comparing the performance of Icahn School of Medicine students longitudinally with performance of students at other medical school s on national standardized exams (USMLE Step 1, Step 2 Clinical Knowledge and Step 2 Clinical Skills, and National Board of Medic al Examiners subject test exams) and with changes in the curriculum content, format and learning experiences. Creating a comprehensive Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) for each student at the end of the third year of medical school. The MSPE compiles all awards and prizes, involvement in school and the community, academic performance, and research accomplishments, and includes the five appendices required by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) to support student applications for residency. ISMMS has created a numeric system to quantify the accomplishments of each student within the goals of the curriculum and the mission of our School and in concert with our definition of success (not only knowledge acquisition but also professional attributes, scholarship, superb communication, and commitment to community and leadership). A grid is used to group students into quartiles according to the guidelines for creation of the MSPE by the AAMC. Analyzing success in the fourth year stude nt match for residency training programs. Data is tracked based upon match rates by specialty choice and specific type and quality of residency program. In the school's internal exit survey, students identify where their ultimate match was on their rank list (top choice or further down on their preference list). Polling graduates and their residency program directors at the end of their internship on how well-prepared our graduates are for residency training and their performance during the graduate medical education experience. Feedback from residency directors provides unique insight in this regard and results are compared against previous years. The MD program has a multi -tiered reporting quality assurance structure to review curricular assessments and provide feedback to appropriate individuals. At the granular level, there are three basic sources of assessment data: Students' grades and other performance- related summative data; Students' evaluations of courses and clerkships. All medical student s complete on -line evaluations of every course and clerkship providing both quantitative and qualitative data. This information is summarized and thematically coded by the Office of Curricular Support and provided to the course/clerkship directors. Faculty reflection/analysis of their course/clerkship for the academic year. In the first level of the assessment process, this data is reviewed by the course/clerkship directors and shared with their faculty. Course/clerkship directors use all of this information to identify areas in which faculty need to improve their teaching skills and/or where the curriculum may 84 need to be adjusted. Concurrently, the Medical Education leadership reviews this information and provides guidance and support to the course/clerks hip directors to facilitate refinement of the educational activities. Information generated through the first level of assessment is then provided to multiple groups: the Curriculum Steering Committee (CSC), an oversight body that continuously reviews and revises our educational process where necessary; the Years 1/2 Course Directors Committee; and the Clinical Curriculum Committee (CCC). This extensive dissemination allows course and clerkship directors as well as educational leaders to share information and lessons learned. Finally, the course/clerkship directors present this information to the Executive Curriculum Committee (ECC), which is the oversight body for the medical school program. The EEC reviews each course or clerkship and provides feedback and recommendations for changes directly to the course/clerkship director(s) and to the CSC in order to ensure that appropriate changes are implemented. The Deans attend the ECC meetings so they are constantly aware of successes as well as of needed impro vements. The overall assessment process is coordinated by the Director for Assessment and Evaluation. This process is continually reviewed by the program's Dean and the Associate and Assistant Deans, with modifications implemented as necessary to ensure that modalities capture the necessary evidence to document student achievement and to provide feedback that informs modifications to our educational process. In addition, program administration reviews assessment methods in the course of periodic self- studies submitted to the LCME and subsequently implements LCME suggestions for improvement. Graduate School Programs The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at ISMMS offers an array of degree granting programs that span the spectrum of basic science to clinical research and population health. Each program maintains its own set of academic expectations, standards (in some cases set by a professional accrediting body), and assessment strategies. All programs are monitored by a committee structure including faculty to ensure students achieve expected learning outcomes. The Graduate School has implemented a number of improvements in response to the 2010 Self-Study findings, and these changes have further strengthened or provided added structure to support the student learning assessment processes. These include: A comprehensive revision of the Graduate Student Handbook to provide a higher level of consistency and to more explicitly define policies and procedures across educational programs. Enhancement of the course evaluation structure for the PhD and Masters in Basic Science programs. - Adopting best practices in place elsewhere in the Graduate School, the PhD and Masters in Basic Science programs implemented a 360\u00ba evaluation for all core and specialty courses, which includes input from students, course directors, teaching faculty, and teaching assistants. The Graduate School Curriculum Committee (GSCC) coordinates a 85 subsequent review of the evaluations and holds course directors accountable for making improvements based on the evaluations. A standard set of evaluation questions is now asked of all students in the Graduate School. Teaching faculty evaluate their respective courses using a newly developed \"Course Evaluation and Course Faculty Response Form.\" Teaching Assistants complete a similar form. Course Directors are expected to review student, faculty, and TA evaluations and develop an action plan that addresses responses, which is then reviewed by the GSCC. - The GSCC reviews new and ongoing courses in a different way. New courses must be approved prior to implementation and the first 360\u00ba evaluation is conducted within three months of completion. New courses are reviewed annually until the GSCC moves it to Ongoing Course status. Ongoing courses are reviewed annually as part of their respective MTA portfolio, with the MTA Director(s) summarizing strengths and weaknesses and plans for remediation. Redesign of the Committee for Academic Review (CAR) process for students' academic performance and professionalism including a standardized appeals procedure. The redesigned structure and process has been expanded to include students from all Graduate School educational programs (previously programs had an independent process with student appeals directed to the Dean of the Graduate School). In the new design, programs will either utilize CAR for their full review or as the first step of an appeals process. CAR membership has been expanded to include representation from all programs and include students. The appeals process has been redrafted and is explicitly delineated in the Graduate Student Handbook. ***** Following is assessment inf ormation specific to each program. Basic Science MS and PhD Programs (Biomedical Sciences/Neuroscience) The Graduate School offers a range of courses and training experiences that culminate in a Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy in either Neuroscience or Biomedical Sciences. The PhD in Neuroscience and the PhD in Biomedical Sciences are built around Multidisciplinary Training Areas (MTA) that are aligned with the School's mission -driven Institute structure (as described in Standard 11). Through core and specialized coursework, journal clubs, small group activities and structured mento ring, students are expected to gain a strong scientific foundation upon which hypothesis- driven basic science research can be conducted. Effective critical reasoning and communication skills are also required for students to produce a scholarly work in the form of a Master's Thesis or PhD Dissertation that must be successfully presented and defended in order to earn their degree. An educational environment that is rich in formal and informal educational opportunities is available to support students' progress toward their degree. Students benefit from a hybrid education; one that includes both traditional courses and one-on-one mentorship, akin to an apprenticeship, for significant portions of the educational process. Assessing student learning in these disparate environments requires different forms of both direct and indirect feedback which are summarized below: 86 Assessing foundational biomedical science knowledge though course related examinations, problem sets, group discussions, and the General Knowledge exam. Assessing excellence in specialized knowledge through examinations in advanced courses, writing assignments, group and one-on-one discussions, and the Thesis Proposal presentation and exam. Assessing scientific and analytical skills through courses, seminars, and journal clubs, in one- on-one mentoring with the students' advisors and mentors, in the qualifying exams, and ultimately in the completion, presentation and oral defense of the thesis or dissertation. Assessing communication skills through seminar/research presentations, literature presentations, written and oral presentation of research proposals and finished projects and in sessions with mentors. Tracking of the timing and achievement of program milestones to confirm student progr ess and growth. Several review structures are in place to accomplish this: - Faculty Advisory Committees, charged with overseeing student progression, have required one-on-one meeting schedules with MSBS and PhD students to confirm satisfactory progress and establish development plans when needed. Faculty Advisory Committees are the primary source for student tracking during the research years. These committees report student progress to the MTA Directors to ensure sufficient progress of the student and that the training goals of the MTA are met. - MTA Directors meet on a regular basis to discuss students whose progress is inadequate and they meet annually to formally review each student in the training area. They update the Program Director about student progress following this annual review. - The Program Director also monitors student progress by reviewing information provided by the MTA Directors and meeting with each student annually to review progress and plan for the following year. He/she reviews information provided by the MTA directors and meets with each student annually to review progress and plans for the next year. - A referral to the Committee for Academic Review (CAR) is made if a student is failing to meet academic, research, or professional stand ards. The result of this review may include formative feedback, remediation planning, or in cases when remediation plans are not completed, dismissal from the program. Evaluating student feedback while training and after graduation in a number of ways including: - The Dean of the Graduate School or the Program Director conducts exit interviews of all departing students, including those who do not complete the program. Each PhD student also completes a written Exit Survey, the results of which are used to e valuate student satisfaction with the program. - Review and response to the results of the annual, student administered Satisfaction Survey which queries student opinion about all facets of academic and extracurricular life at Mount Sinai. - Biannual alumni surveys to track career progression and professional activities of graduates. Oversight of the student learning assessment process is assured in several ways. The Graduate School Curriculum Committee conducts an annual review of all existing courses and approves all new courses to confirm that they are consistent with institutional and Graduate School 87 missions, demonstrate appropriate excellence and rigor and that they complement current course offerings. The Curriculum Committee also oversees implementation and monitors the success of all policies and procedures related to course or student assessment. The Graduate School Steering Committee is tasked with using student learning outcomes as a component of their strategic planning deliberations and recomme ndations to the Dean. The Steering and Curriculum committees often work as a seamless unit to develop and implement a broad range of policies and procedures. Finally, data from our graduate programs are compiled and compared to data from other similar pr ograms. Data sources include the National Survey of Graduate Faculty, the survey of graduate programs by the National Research Council, the Group on Graduate Research, Education, and Training Education and Training (GREAT), and the AAMC. MD/PhD Program The joint degree MD/PhD Program is an important ISMMS training priority. Mount Sinai's considerable expertise in translational science positions us well to educate future physician - scientists in rapidly advancing basic science discoveries that lead to clinically relevant treatment paradigms. MD/PhD students complete the first two years of medical school, followed by four or five years meeting the requirements for a PhD in Biomedical Scie nces or Neuroscience, and then return to medical school to complete the clinical training required for the MD degree. Upon graduation, students typically enter residency programs and often combine fellowship and postdoctoral studies thereafter. For over 35 years, the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences has received partial funding support for the MD/PhD Program through a prestigious NIH award Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) grant. An application for competitive renewal is submitted every five years and requires ISMMS to demonstrate student and programmatic success as measured by criteria such as trainees' research publications, completion records and current positions of past trainees. Students in the MD/PhD program are expected to fulfill the standard learning outcome requirements of the MD and the PhD programs. Significant discussion took place during the course of this Self-Study about whether unique attributes required of effective physician-scientists -- which are incremental to being only a successful clinical physician or academic scientist -- warrant additional expectations and associated additional layers of student learning assessment in the MD/PhD program. The discussion evolved beyond just the MD/PhD program to include ISMMS students in other dual degree programs, including the MD/MPH and MD/MSCR programs. Although conclusions were not reached, it was agreed that this important dialogue should continue. Master of Public Health The Master of Public Health (MPH) requires students to demonstrate progress toward achieving pre-determined competencies for degree completion in preparation for becoming members of the public health workforce. This competency -based educational approach is consistent with the requirements of the program accrediting organization, The Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH); CEPH aims to foster workforce development and help academic institutions and training providers develop curricula and course content. 88 The latest revision of the program's core set of public health competencies was completed in June 2014. The competencies were developed by both administrators and faculty within the MPH program with oversight provided by the program's Curriculum Committee. Competencies are used to guide overall program learning objectives, curriculum development and course specific learning objectives. These competencies are the primary guide for measuring student achievement i n the classroom, in the practicum, in the culminating experience and in other service learning opportunities. All methods of assessment are linked backed to the program competencies, which students are expected to achieve at degree completion. Detailed stu dent assessment data is compiled and disseminated to pertinent program and institutional committees for review and comment, thus ensuring a continual iterative process of student and program evaluation. The Curriculum Committee has responsibility for the ongoing assessment and evolution of the competencies to ensure they remain relevant and are adequately addressed by the program curriculum. In addition to the core public health competencies that every student must demonstrate to earn the degree, each specialty track has an additional set of competencies. Students are initially informed of the core and specialty competencies through the website and then on Blackboard upon entry into the program. Assessment of MPH student achievement occurs at multip le levels with continual evaluation. Examples of indirect and direct measures of student achievement include: Assessing learning through coursework, including examinations, small group exercises, laboratory sessions, final papers, multiple choice examinations, group projects, and oral presentations. Maintaining a \"B\" average throughout the program and upon degree completion. Completing a 150-hour public health practicum experience that is planned, mentored and evaluated by a qualified field preceptor who provides feedback including student behavior, attitudes, motivation, reliability, dependability and team interaction. Completing a culminating experience. Students must work with an advisor to develop an original research question related to public health, gather and analyze data and summarize their findings in a 25 to 30 page written master's thesis or capstone project. This experience is iterative and requires continual feedback from the academic advisor(s) as the project progresses. Upon completion, students participate in an \"intellectual dialogue\" with their advisor and a second reader. Students are also assessed on a five to ten minute oral presentation summarizing the project followed by an in-depth discussion of strengths and weaknesses. Twice during the program, students must self-evaluate their progress in achieving program competencies. This is done through a Competency Survey. The MPH program regularly evaluates how student achievement is measured and whether those results demonstrate that learni ng outcomes are being met, using data and methods that include: The MPH Curriculum Committee reviews the course evaluations with the Course Director who is expected to make revisions to the curriculum in response to the evaluations and to ensure that learning objectives, which are mapped to competencies, are met. Critically 89 evaluating student course evaluations allows for effective feedback on course content, teaching format and the skills of the course director. The MPH Curriculum Committee reviews the r aw data generated from the student completed Competency Surveys which provides another perspective on potential gaps in learning objectives. Monitoring of degree completion rates (which is also an annual report required to be submitted to CEPH on an annual basis). Conducting annual informal student feedback sessions and exit surveys of all graduating students. Conducting annual employer and practicum site surveys. The methods for assessment of student learning are continually reviewed for their relevance and utility at multiple levels. Initially this process is coordinated by the Curriculum Committee, which reports to the Program administration as part of a continual feedback loop that includes planning, modification, assessment, and implementation. Additionally, the program administration reviews its assessment methods with several key stakeholders, including the External Advisory Board, in the course of its periodi c self -study process for its accrediting body CEPH. Finally, the annual review and reaccreditation process by CEPH includes updated guidance that contributes to the review and shapes the methods of student learning assessment at the macro level. PhD and Master of Science in Clinical Research (MSCR) Programs These programs are designed to foster the development of future leaders in patient-oriented research through the encouragement of critical thinking and analytical acumen necessary to conduct innovative hypothesis-driven, independent and collaborative team- based clinical/translational scientific research. Fourteen consensus-based competency domains supported by the NIH funded Clinical and T ranslational Science Award (CTSA) guide overall program learning objectives. The outcome measures used to assess student performance in these respective programs are also comparable to other CTSA directed clinical research education programs across the country and are informed by these nationally accepted norms. Under the auspices of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, the Clinical Research programs have adopted the standards employed for assessing and awarding an MS or PhD degrees in biomedical sc ience. Since the initiation of the PhD program, a number of changes have been implemented in our assessment of student learning to further enhance the rigor of this educational training venue. Student performance is assessed according to: established milestones for core course requirements; qualifying exams (if applicable); and research thesis development conduct, defense (if applicable) and deposit. The specific milestones are provided to students at the time of orientation and are also posted on the website and on Blackboard. The Clinical Research Education Program utilizes a variety of outcome measures either common or distinct for each of the respective degree granting programs to assess student learning including: 90 Assessing core knowledge using homework assignments, problems sets and examinations Participating in a year -long clinical/translational seminar series, \"Works in Progress\", where professionalism, critical thinking, leadership abilities, teamwork, oral presentation skills and respectful, co nstructive debate are evaluated and feedback is provided Participating in a year -long Clinical/Translational Journal Club, including required leadership of at least one session, where mastery of methodology and analytical skills are further developed and e valuated Assessing written and oral communication skills, leadership and teamwork through participation in Journal Club, Grant Writing Course, Annual Research Day and Writing Workshops Maintaining a \"B\" average in required coursework Assessing professional ism through a required term paper on topic of relevance to ethics in clinical research, and participation in required Ethics curriculum Successful completion, submission and deposit of thesis (Masters program) Successful completion of written qualifying e xam, oral thesis presentation and dissertation defense (PhD program) Tracking of entry and post graduate appointments, grants, awards, publications and participation in interdisciplinary team science, utilizing Graduate Tracking Survey System (GTSS) The critical evaluation of ongoing curricular activities and the implementation of new curricular initiatives are overseen by the Center for Patient Oriented Research Training, Education and Development (CePORTED) Curriculum Committee (as distinct from the Grad uate School Curriculum Committee which reviews the basic science curriculum). Course evaluations and student feedback are reviewed with the Course Director who is charged with making changes to ensure the learning objectives have been met. A similar approa ch is taken for evaluating workshops and additional educational forums. Formative evaluations are also provided to Course Directors by assigned advisors, mentors and faculty involved in the oversight of specific coursework. Assessing the progress of indiv idual PhD students is conducted through the Multidisciplinary Advisory Committee (MAC) process. Students are required to meet twice annually with their three-person MAC to receive ongoing feedback concerning: progress in developing a research thesis proposal; assessment and formal feedback verbally and in writing regarding approval or adjustments to proposed thesis following formal oral presentation of proposed thesis work to be pursued; and ultimate evaluation of dissertation defense. The PhD in Clinical Research program is now overseen by a PhD oversight committee comprised of four faculty with complementary clinical/translational research expertise and scientific backgrounds. This oversight committee was established in response to a recognized need to enlist experts in relevant disciplines to provide leadership and input to the recruitment process and achievement of specific milestones. This committee meets monthly and reviews ongoing and emerging curricular needs, student progress, and program r ecruitment strategies. 91 Master of Science in Genetic Counseling (MGC) Program The competency based MGC program utilizes standards established by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC), the professional accreditation body for genetic counseling programs. Of note, accreditation of graduate genetic counseling training was previously the responsibility of the American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC), the body that also administers the national board certification examinations in genetic counseling. In 2013 it was determined that accreditation and certification should be independent and the ACGC was created to assume the accreditation role. The American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC) remains the certifying body for genetic counselors . As an accredited program, Mount Sinai submits required annual reports to the ACGC. The most recent report demonstrated compliance with competencies and was r eviewed favorably. Periodic full accreditation reviews are conducted by self -study and site visitation. The ISMMS MGC self - study for re -accreditation is due in September 2015, and a site visit will take place in 2016. At each stage of the MGC program, learning objectives are assessed using a variety of outcome measures that include: Evaluating students in their didactic curriculum in a number of ways: exams (multiple choice, short answer, and essays), papers, small group interactions, review of standardized patient encounters and overall program participation. Written evaluations by clinical supervisors of student progress in mastering ACGC clinical competencies during clinical rotations and review of student case logs. Holding regularly scheduled clinical supervisor meetings to review student status. In addition, one to two formal meetings of all supervisors across disciplines for further evaluation and development of clinical education plans are held for each student. Thesis requirements are reviewed and evaluated by the faculty preceptor(s). In addition, students are required to give an oral presentation of their thesis results to clinical faculty and staff, and a MGC thesis committee evaluates and provides feedback on each thesis. Further evidenc e that the program is successfully meeting learning outcomes is provided by: Data from the certification examinations support that graduates of our program successfully master core competency requirements. Tracking of graduate activities and publications also support the achievement of our outcomes. Didactic courses and clinical training experiences are evaluated by students and reviewed by the program's internal Curriculum Committee. Results are reviewed with Course Directors and Clinical Supervisors who are responsible for making adjustments when needed. In addition to the ACGC accreditation and Curriculum Committee, the Program is subject to review by the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences. Finally, the program provides updates to, and solicits feedback from its Advisory Board on an annual basis. 92 Master of Science in Health Care Delivery Leadership (MSHCDL) Program As described in Standard 11, ISMMS launched a Master of Science in Health Care Delivery Leadership in August of 2014 after receiving approvals from the New York State Department of Education in late April 2014 and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in March 2014. The program, delivered in a distance learning format described fully in Standard 13, is designed to deepen knowledge of environments, processes, structures, and strategies that are driving disruption in health care. Accordingly, the curriculum has three main components: an exploration of broad principles and key influe ncers of the health care system; an examination of evidence -based frameworks for strategic leadership and effective management of health care deliver y organizations and issues; and analysis of novel health care delivery models, and clinical and tran slational research innovations. The program is delivered on a cohort basis utilizing a blended learning design consisting of two one- week residency -based seminar session s, weekly synchronous sessions, and asynchronous learning experiences for existing senior health care professionals. The overarching learning goals of the program are to: Lead in appraising models and crafting strategies that guide health care organizations toward successful adoption of, and adaptation to, changes in policy and management. Be critical consumers of the major literature on health care delivery and its reform, with the ability to judge the quality of prominent proposals for innovation in health care systems, and a capacity to discern challenges in the translation of theories into practice. Know how to access, interpret, and apply reliable evidence from multiple sources, both qualitative and quantitative, to organizational pro blem -solving. Analyze the larger environments (political, financial, economic, competitive) of health care organizations and assess the influence of external developments for organizations in which they have, or aspire to have, leadership roles. Bridge, b oth conceptually and institutionally, the worlds of clinical care medicine and population-based health improvements. The program has a multifaceted student learning outcomes assessment process including student activity tracking in each course, monitoring of course -to-course persistence and program completion, and student surveys (course, exit, and post-graduation) as general/indirect methods for monitoring overall student progress and achievement. As highlighted in Chapter 11, and listed in Appendix 14-B, the primary student learning outcomes assessment process is organized upon course- level assessments which relate to specific course learning goals that are, in turn, mapped to the competencies desired of all students in the program. The assessment met hods for this student audience are consistent with the types of assessments used in other graduate programs by being heavily geared toward individual paper assignments, case study analysis, annotated bibliographies, organizational assessments, and other project -based work. The rubrics used relate to course learning goal(s) and to ensuring academic depth and rigor, and are appropriate to the learning experience. 93 As a further means to validate the quality and breadth of outcomes, the program learning competencies (which are described in Appendix 11-D) are modeled on peer- reviewed research conducted on competency assessment within health care management degree programs. The Program Director will request from faculty, at the conclusion of each course, aggregate data by assessment and course goal. This data aggregation and mapping process will enable the program leadership to assess attainment of learning goals and competency acquisition across the breath of desired outcomes. Gaps will be addressed in consultation with the program leadership and faculty. Additionally, aggregate results of these evaluations and resulting action plans will be shared annually with the Graduate School and the Dean's Office. The Blackboard management system has multiple fea tures to facilitate the student learning outcomes assessment process which are particularly important in a distance learning environment. See Standard 13 for a more detailed description of these features. Appendix 14-B lists the assessment methods for th is program including the direct methods of lecture embedded quizzes on critical concepts, question response, and poll tracking in synchronous sessions, assessment of individual discussion posts, critical essays, reflections, and case study analysis, report ing out and benchmarking of self-assessment results, and production and assessment of a Capstone project. The assessment plan also uses the indirect methods of course mapping, Blackboard user tracking, Student course evaluations, persistence rate tracking, and exit and alumni surveys The program has not yet completed its first full year nor graduated its first class of students. At this early stage in the life of the program initial analysis will occur course -by-course and then aggregated yearly thereafter with course evaluations to be used as immediate feedback with alumni surveys occurring every 1 and 3 years out for each cohort. The assessment plan for this new program is part of a larger program evaluation plan, based on competency standards identified in the literature of heath care administration education, and fortified with metrics embedded with the learning management system (Blackboard). However, some of the anticipated challenges to this plan revolve around limitations in benchmarking against the competencies given the unique nature of the audience (senior health care leaders), tracking student's post-program success in leadership roles, and calibrating an appropriate level and blend of metrics derived from the digital and in-person lear ning experiences. We will address such challenges as the program evolves. ***** In summary, ISMMS employs rigorous evaluation processes to examine student progress and program strengths and weaknesses, all in the context of program, school and institutional mission. Students, course directors, faculty, teaching assistants and administrators participate in reviewing and revising courses and programs. In addition to extensive internal evaluation metrics, ISMMS also benchmarks our students and programs agai nst external standards when possible, including standardized tests and competency standards established by external regulatory bodies. Our comprehensive monitoring, analysis and follow-up ensure that ISMMS students receive excellent educations and move on to successful careers in biomedicine and related fields. 94 Conclusion The Self -Study and Report confirm that Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) readily meets or exceeds all standards set forth by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The Self-Study process provided faculty, students and staff and the broader ISMMS community with ample evidence that the School is thriving and will continue to do so into the future. This concluding section summarizes the success of ISMMS in fulfilling each of the MSCHE standards. The voluminous documentation examined during the Self-Study, and the extensive discussions of all aspects of our program and School, provide ample evidence of our many strengths and bright future. Standard 1 - Mission ISMMS has a clearly defined mission, with goals and objectives that flow directly from that mission. The mission statement addresses a strong commitment to education, research, clinical care and scholarship, and also recognizes the importance of serving t he community and creating a sound work environment. Taken together, the components of the mission statement set the stage for an outstanding educational experience for our students. The Self -Study has generated interest in possible changes to the mission statement that would create a more tightly worded document that resembles those of many other schools. If pursued, such a statement would have the dual advantages of placing additional emphasis on innovation and creativity, and of creating a more concise message. Pursuit of alternatives is likely in 2015. The School's mission is closely linked to the planning, resource and assessment practices described under Standards 2, 3 and 7, and in fact is present throughout all standards. Standard 2 - Planning ISMMS plans extensively to ensure mission fulfillment and optimal allocation of resources. The Strategic Plan, developed with broad input from multiple constituencies, is a guiding force for the School, setting the course for success of our educational and research programs and in clinical care. The Strategic Plan is adjusted over time in response to changing internal and external realities; its flexible, dynamic format allows us to be nimble in positioning ourselves optimally in each area. The creation of the Mount Sinai Health System and an increasingly competitive economic environment at the local and federal levels are two notable examples of forces that led the School to plan for and accommodate changes that could not have been foreseen a few years ago. Planning and assessment together play a strong role in decisions regarding resource allocation. The Strategic Plan is complemented by extensive short range planning as well as planning at the local level. The ample evidence of the success of our p lanning efforts is noted under Standard 7. Standard 3 - Resources The School's robust educational infrastructure is continuously evaluated and improved through careful planning and resource allocation. A broad range of resources, e.g., classrooms, librar y, 95 information technology, laboratories, clinical settings and personnel, support the mission and provide excellent education and training to our students. Well defined, executed and disseminated policies ensure optimal resource allocation. Excellent fin ancial planning and oversight keep the School on a break-even budget every year. Complementary processes in other areas such as space allocation and capital planning, utilize appropriate metrics and oversight to direct resources where they are most acutel y needed. An external environment that includes a tightening NIH budget and increasing clinical competition compels us to maintain our current vigilance in order to protect our sound financial position. Towards this end, it is imperative that we continue to employ rigorous control over resources to keep us strong into the future. Building a significantly enhanced website, a project which has just begun, will require enormous stakeholder effort to ensure that the final product is informative, easi ly navigable and effectively serves its many constituencies. Standard 4 - Leadership and Governance ISMMS has a clearly defined governance system and a dedicated, talented Board of Trustees that supports all facets of the School's policy development and decision -making. The various committees of the Board are focused on specific areas of School functions are well suited to members' interests and expertise. Strong conflicts of interest policies ensure that Board members function entirely without self -interest in the School's activities. In close collaboration with School leadership, the Board ensures the ongoing strength of the institution. Students have ample opportunities to provide input through a strong student governance structure, access to leadership and participation in strategic initiatives. The Faculty Council is a representative body which is a forum for discussion and serves as a conduit to the Dean. Standard 5 - Administration The Dean of ISMMS is a highly experienced administrator, phys ician -scientist and leader who works closely with the Health System CEO to maintain excellence and grow School programs. A network of deans is responsible for specific areas relevant to their own expertise, and report to the ISMMS Dean or other Deans. Oth er leaders include academic department chairs and institute directors. The overall size of the staff is appropriate to carrying out all School programs and services that tie into our mission. Decision-making is tied to the planning, resource allocation a nd assessment activities described in Standards 2, 3 and 7. Standard 6 -- Integrity High ethical standards are applied in all areas of our mission, from education to research to clinical care to scholarship to community service. All activities take place within an environment that places high value on academic and intellectual freedom. ISMMS policies and processes are clearly articulated and widely promulgated; the mssm.edu website is a favored resource for both. These include policies pertinent to faculty promotion, compensation and hiring, as well as staff employment policies. Ample information is available to prospective students on admissions, retention, curriculum, etc. 96 Standard 7 - Institutional Assessment Assessment approaches are many and varied, but all are designed to ensure that the School fulfills its multifaceted mission. ISMMS assessment practices are ongoing and very data -driven, with metrics available in many areas that are complemented as appropriate or necessary with less quantifiable evidence. These metrics are essential to evaluating our success in fulfilling the components of our mission. Planning and resource allocation decisions are closely tied to assessment to ensure that the School remai ns on course and directs its resources to ensure success. Educational program assessment and student outcomes are also extensive, and are described in detail under Standards 11 and 14. Standard 8 - Student Admissions and Retention Consistent with the institutional mission, ISMMS seeks a student body that is passionate about biomedical research and clinical care, scholarship, community service and advocacy. We actively seek to attract a diverse pool of applicants who are high academic achievers with enthusiasm for learning and a commitment to their chosen field of study. Students facing academic challenges are identified early and provided with the support they need to succeed. Admission policies, program and curriculum descriptions, and expectations are posted on the web for both prospective and current students. Financial aid information is also readily available. Standa rd 9 - Student Support Services ISMMS offers a wide array of support services to ensure the academic progress and overall well - being of students enrolled in our degree-granting programs. Qualified professionals manage and deliver the services necessary for our students' academic and professional success, including academic support and mentoring, technology support, and health and wel lness resources. The Office of Enrollment Services serves both the medical and graduate programs in the areas of orientation, admissions, registrar, bursar, academic calendar, financial aid, housing and benefits. Student records are securely maintained, w ith a clear policy on information release confidentiality. Multiple avenues, both formal and informal are available for students to voice concerns and grievances, and remedial actions are taken as necessary. All student support services are reviewed o n a regular basis to ensure that they effectively meet the needs of our student body. Continued pursuit of philanthropy to support educational scholarships and student debt relief is an ongoing challenge that is critical for continuing to attract high caliber students. Standard 10 - Faculty ISMMS faculty are highly qualified to teach in, and develop content for, our educational programs. Clearly articulated appointment and promotion standards are complemented by faculty development programs which provide skill building and mentorship. Policies of specific relevance to faculty, ranging from compensation to discipline, are posted on the website. The ISMMS faculty has grown rapidly with the creation of the Mount Sinai Health System. The integration of member hospital faculty requires new and innovative approaches to dissemination 97 of information and access to resources that will ensure the success of all faculty. Further, metrics to evaluate our success in these efforts will be important. Stan dard 11 - Educational Offerings ISMMS offers a rich variety of educational programs leading to advanced degrees. Every degree -granting program has well -developed goals, rigorous curricula and well -defined expectations of student learning outcomes. Program s utilize a variety of learning settings appropriate to their unique educational goals and to each course, and there is an overarching commitment to providing educational experiences that are relevant, supportive and promote the acquisition of cutting- edge knowledge in clinical care, research and related fields. Each program undergoes regular self-evaluation and is responsible to School leadership and in some cases, to external professional accreditation bodies. With the introduction of a distance learning component in our new Master of Health Care Delivery, we will need to employ and confirm appropriate and effective assessment methods to ensure that we meet program goals and achieve expected student outcomes. Standard 13 - Related Educational Activities ISMMS offers a variety of programs that do not confer degrees but are nevertheless consistent with our educational, research and clinical mission. These include certificate programs, Graduate Medical Education (postgraduate clinical training), Continuing Medical Education (life-long learning for clinicians) and postdoctoral research training. In all cases, the School provides qualified faculty and appropriate resources, and conforms to relevant external requirements. This academic year, the School has embarked on its first distance learning experience through the new Master in Health Care Delivery program; the program received Substantive Change approval from Middle States in 2014. Although the first class will not graduate until Spring 2016, tools to m easure student outcomes and program assessment have already been established to ensure that we meet our educational goals and objectives. Standard 14 - Assessment of Student Learning ISMMS puts tremendous effort into developing clear student outcome expec tations for its courses and programs, and collecting and analyzing information in order to modify educational offerings as needed to promote student success. Regular assessments are essential in confirming achievement of expected student learning outcomes . 98 LIST OF APPENDICES : Appendix 1- A: Mission Statement Appendix 1- B: Fulfillment of Mission Statement Appendix 1- C: Standard 1 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 2- A: Standard 2 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 2-B: MD Curriculum Design Team Membership Appendix 3- A: Standard 3 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 3-B: Unrestricted Operating Budget Appendix 3-C: Floor Plan - Annenberg 14 Appendix 3- D: Library Instructional/Informational Literacy Program Appendix 3-E: Library Utilization Statistics Appendix 4- A: Standard 4 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 5- A: Organizational Structure Appendix 5- B: Standard 5 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 6- A: Standard 6 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 7- A: Standard 7 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 8- A: Standard 8 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 8-B: Admissions Data Appendix 8-C: Admissions Websites Appendix 8- D: Student Gender and URM Status Metrics Appendix 8- E: Average Medical School Debt of Indebted Graduates Appendix 9- A: Standard 9 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 9-B : Medical Student Comprehensive Evaluation 2013-14 Appendix 9-C: Graduate Student Comprehensive Evaluation 2013-14 Appendix 10- A: Standard 10 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 10- B: Faculty Job Description Appendix 10-C: Faculty Performance Review Template Appendix 10- D: Faculty Demographics Appendix 11- A: Standard 11 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 11-B: MD Program Core Competencies Appendix 11-C: MS in Health Care Delivery Leadership Program Courses Appendix 11-D: MS in Health Care Delivery Leadership Program Competencies Appendix 11-E: MS in Health Care Delivery Leadership Program Evaluation Plan Appendix 13- A: Standard 13 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 14- A: Standard 14 Fundamental Elements Grid Appendix 14-B: Summary of Student Assessment Policies and Methods C: Program Timelines Appendix 1-A Mission Statement APPENDIX 1 -A ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI MISSION STATEMENT PREAMBLE In the context of the Jewish traditions of scholarship and charity, the Board of Trustees commits Mount Sinai to the advancement of the art and science of medicine through clinical excellence.

Appendix 1-B Fulfillment of Mission Statement APPENDIX 1 -B MISSION FULFILLMENT The overarching institutional mission is to provide \" high-quality patient care and teaching...in an atmosphere of social concern and scholarly inquiry into the nature, causation, prevention and therapy of human disease.\" A wide range of programs, services and practices contribute to fulfillment of each of the six components of the mission, which are closely intertwined. Brief commentary on each component is provided below. I. CLINICAL CARE : \"...strive to provide superlative patient care, considered to be the requisite model for learning.\" The provision of superb patient care i n both inpatient and outpatient settings is a priority , and is closely linked to student training experiences. Quality of care metrics and patient satisfaction surveys help confirm our excellent and compassionate services, which are further corroborated by external performance metrics and peer recognition of our success as clinical providers. II. EDUCATION: Graduate individuals committed to a lifetim e of continuing education while they are contributing in many and varied ways to the health needs of people... responsible for certification of physicians at <all> levels, as well as certification of biomedical scientists at the graduate level; and, as appropriate, undertake the education of other health and allied professionals Lifelong learning is a priority in all ISMMS educational programs. Intensive information literacy training emphasizing the sourcing and effective use of the biomedical literature helps to equip students with the technical expertise to continuously grow in their respective professions . All programs focus on graduating students who are not merely competent in their field of study, but also excel; an emphasis on translational researc h in particular encourages students to recognize the interface between science and medicine so that they can push the boundaries in advancing biomedicine. III. RESEARCH : \"... Fundamental and applied research will be primarily centered in geographic proximity to clinical facilities...encourage, support and evaluate innovative ideas and programs in health services delivery... Mount Sinai will encourage, support and evaluate innovative ideas and programs in health services delivery.\" ISMMS has a large and productive research program supported b y an excellent infrastructure. Clinical and research spaces are in close proximity to facilitate interaction and innovation, e.g., Hess Center for Science and Medicine, the Annenberg Building and the Icahn Medical Institute. Multidisciplinary institutes encourage collaboration and exploration across disciplines, and new institutes and research programs are introduced as internal capability and external exigencies evolve. IV. DISSEMINATION OF KNOWLEDGE : \"...Participate as a national and international resource in the gathering, analysis and dissemination of information pertaining to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease... \" Mount Sinai physicians, scientists and other professionals are expected to publish and lecture locally, nationally and internationally on their work. The appointment and promotion guidelines in the Faculty Handbook emphasize scholarship at every level. Graduate and medical students are mentored on both presenting and publishing. V. CONCERN FOR THE COMMUNITY: \"...Be ever -sensitive to the social and health care needs of the many different communities it serves... participate in efforts to define and solve health problems in population groups and communities through its capability in developing scientific knowledge, education and service.\" The importance of addressing community needs - particularly in the socioeconomically challenged East Harlem neighborhood that borders ISMMS - is evidenced through numerous student and faculty programs. Examples include the student- run East Harlem Health Outreach Partnership (health care for uninsured community residents), First Generation Scholars (MD students mentor high school students) and the Post-Bacc alaureate Research Education Program (supporting underrepresented minority and disadvantaged students asp iring to careers in biomedic al research ). VI. ORGANIZATION: \"...create an evolving work environment conductive to individual creativity. \" Career developm ent opportunities abound for both faculty and staff. Our fast-pa ced environment encourages innovation and creativity, with a common goal of creating a more effective and rewarding environment for those who work and study at Mount Sinai.

LSU New Orleans was unable to submit data in 2005.Prior to 2007, the Total Number of Graduates was collected on the LCME Part II Survey, while the Total Number of Graduates with Medical School Debt was collected on the LCME Part I-B. Given differen ces between these two surveys, the Total Number of Graduates with Medical School Debt may exceed the Total Number of Graduates. Moreover, the Percentage of Graduates with Medical School Debt may exceed 100 percent. The LCME Part II is administered in the winter and asks for an estimate of the expected graduates for that academic ye ar. By contrast, the LMCE Part I-B is administered in the summer following graduation and asks for actual graduates. Starting in 2007, the Total Number of Graduates and the Total Number of Graduates with Medica l School Debt come from the LCME Part I-B. Since then, there h ave been no anomalous differences between the Total Number of Graduates and the Total Number of Graduates with Medical School Debt.

We feel that the ability of Student Affairs to adequately advocate and advise students is compromised by the fact th at it also evaluates students - for example, through ranking systems and Dean's Letters. Although we recognize that there are anonymous resources for raising our concerns sa fely and without fear of retribution, we feel that this anonymity does not facilitate transparency or accountability for change. We feel that Student Affairs has demonstrated a l ack of respect for us and our classmates and their particular circumstances. Although the people submitting this statement may not necessarily be directly affected by all of th ese issues, we all still feel that they are important concerns that do negatively affect student performance and medical education. Specifically: 1) Our classmates have expressed feeling harassed by MedEd, through \"at-risk\" meetings and confrontational emails, especially those directed at our underrepresented minority classmates. 2) Our cl assmates have felt that Student Affairs has been unyielding and unhelpful with regards to the unplanned emergencies surrounding family, including those of us with ch ildren. 3) Many of us feel hesitant about talking to MedEd advocates because of perceived fear of retribution, especially through incident reports about professionalism. We look forward to being part of an institution that values respect for students and respect for diversity. \" Medical Education Response Comment shared with Dr. Muller, Dr. Karani, Dr. Gliatto, Dr. Butts, Dr. Ann-Gel Palermo, and ShashiAnand Medical Education met with Student Council leadership to discuss - Conclusion: more information was needed Student Council leadership anonymously met with students who produced comment in two focus groups to clarify points Student Council leadership conveyed information back to Medical Education 47 Actions Taken MedEd examining better ways to reach out to students having academic difficulties to ensure the tone is perceived as supportive Expansion of diversity goals - Diversity representation on Student Council Steering Committee - Discussion about having the People's Institute for Survival return to offer their Beyond Undoing Racism Workshop - Support for school-wide diversity initiatives Clarification of MSPE policies (and evaluations in general) Re-examining absence policies 48 Appendix 9-C Graduate Student Comprehensive Evaluation 2013-14 2013-2014 School Year Comprehensive Evaluation: Summary Presentation Tobias Cohen, Candidate 5thyr Jessica Candidate 2ndyr Candidate 2ndyr Vivian Nguyen, MPH Candidate 2ndyr March 9th, 2015 Outline 1.

All students complete a General Knowledge exam before the end of their 3rd semester in the PhD program ( PhD Only ). In the last 6 years, 10% of students failed to meet the minimum grade requirement in the core curriculum. Fifty percent of students who failed successfully completed a remediation plan while the remainder either withdrew or were dismissed from the program. Students are monitored constantly during courses. Students who struggle meet with the course director for extra help from the Course Director and/or the course TA. In several courses, they are also offered peer -tutoring. Those students who fail to meet any of these academic standards are reviewed by the Committee for Academic Review (CAR). CAR can take several actions including, developing a remediation plan, designating the student as on academic monitoring statu s (e.g. academic probation) and/or dismissal from the program. Students are generally given a remediation plan and placed on academic probation.

Meeting with research mentors is on a frequent ongoing basis, while All students are expected to complete all coursework with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. Students are expected to present at least 1 -journal article each semester and show steady improvement in presentation skills over time. Each student is given a passing or failing grade on his/her Thesis Proposal exam. Each student must pass this exercise before he/she can move on to full-time pursuit of dissertation research. At regularly scheduled committee meetings, students must show satisfactory progress on the research project and Students who do not show improving skill in oral presentations are required to participate in Journal Clubs beyond the Thesis Proposal Exam. Students who do not receive a passing grade on the Thesis Proposal exam are required to retake the exam. They are mentored throughout the re- examination preparation process by their primary research advisor. If a student fa ils a second time he/she is presented to CAR and will likely be dismissed from the program.

All students are expected to maintain professional standards in all elements of their academic and scholarly work. The most common reason students are brought before CAR for possible disciplinary actions is plagiari sm. Since 2009, Students who do not receive a passing grade in \"Responsible Conduct of Research\", are given an opportunity to remediate deficiencies. Remediation plans are developed individually for each student. Students whose mentor or advisory committee identifies deficiencies in this area must complete a remediation plan developed for the student by the mentor/committee. 11 Learning Goals (Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes) Method of Teaching (Lecture, Lab, Small Group, Medium Group, Self -Study) Method of Assessment or Monitoring (Small Group, Faculty Evaluation, Oral, Essay, Practical or MCQ exam) (Indirect Method ) Targets / Results Contingency or Action Plan three students were presented to CAR for plagiarism.
