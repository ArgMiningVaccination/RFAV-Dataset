INDICATIONS : Cardiac Arrest TREATMENT : A.Cardiac arrest rhythms frequently change. If, or when, there is a change in the rhythm, move to the appropriate algorithm. B.Use a Pit -Crew Approach to assign responders to designated positions. C.Initiate and maintain high quality chest compressions with limited interruptions (< 10 seconds) . D.There should be no interruptions to CPR when securing a patient's airway. Once secured, ventilation rate should be 8 - 10 breaths per minute. Consider early use of a supraglottic airway to minimize CPR interruptions or when ALS resources are limited. E.If a mechanical CPR device is available, avoid extra or prolonged pauses in CPR when applying. F.Preferred order of vascular access in adults is upper extremity IV (or external jugular vein) , upper extremity IO, then lower extremity IO. Preferred access site for pediatric patients is the proximal tibia or the distal femur. Humeral IO is NOT recommended for infants and toddlers. G.Early epinephrine administration is associated with improved patient outcomes. 1.For patients in a non -shockable rhythm, epinephrine should be administered as soon as feasible, ideally within 5 minutes of EMS arrival to patient side . 2.For shockable rhythms, administer epinephrine as soon as feasible after second defibrillation attempt h as failed. H.If patient has return of spontaneous circulation, reassess vital signs to ensure stability before packaging for transport. Follow the Cardiac Arrest Post Resuscitation protocol to include targeted temperature management, obtaining a 12-lead ECG, and managing blood pressure. I.In general, continue resuscitation for a minimum of 30 minutes. Cardiac arrests are best run at location the patient is found until ROSC or until resuscitation attempt s cease. Patient movement and transport is associated with low quality compressions unless a mechanical CPR device is available. J.With high quality CPR and the addition of mechanical CPR devices , a growing number of patients have been reported to experience \"CPR Induced Consciousness\". Assess for signs of consciousness by checking for s pontaneous eye opening , purposeful movement , or v erbal response includ ing moaning . If signs of \"CPR Induced Con sciousness\" are present , treat as follows: 1.Up to 2.5 of fentanyl IV/IO . 2.May repeat as needed every 5 - 10 minutes.

Cardiac Arrest ( Trauma ) - 10.050 Treatment - Created 9/8/ 20 Traumatic Cardiac Arrest - 10.050 Cardia c Arre st (Trauma) - 10.050 PURPOSE: Unwitnessed traumatic arrest is almost uniformly fatal while EMS witnessed arrest due to severe hypovolemia, hypoxia , or tension pneumothorax may respond to prehospital resuscitation. The purpose of this protocol is to determine when someone should have an attempt at resuscitation when in traumatic arrest. DEFINITION S: A.Traumatic arrest : Loss of pulses and apnea secon dary to trauma, not attributable to medical causes. B.HAT Resuscitation: Treatable causes of witnessed traumatic arrest. Hypovolemia: Control external bleeding If blunt trauma, apply pelvic binder/wrap Administer 1000 ml of Normal Saline or Lactated Ringers Airway/Oxygenation: Ensure airway patency and effective Tension Pneumothorax: Perform bilateral needle chest decompression PROCEDURE: A.Trauma patients who are pulseless and apneic on EMS arrival are considered dead in the field per the Death and Dying protocol (50.025) unless there are extenuating circumstances ( e.g. h ypothermia, possible medical cause) . B.For patients found in VF or Pulseless VT on EMS arrival, suspect a medical event and treat per the VF/pulseless VT protocol . C.For patients who deteriorate to PEA or asystole on scene , begin HAT resuscitation : 1.If ROSC is obtained, transport . 2.If ROSC is not achieve d, you may declare the patient dead or contact OLMC for guidance . D.For patients who arrest during transport , initiate HAT resuscitation and : 1.If within 15 minutes of a trauma center, continue to the trauma center. 2.If farther than 15 minutes to the trauma center, consider pulling over for crew safety and personnel resource reasons . If ROSC is not achieved, you may declare the patient dead or contact OLMC for guidance . NOTES AND PRECAUTIONS: A.If the mechanism of injury appears inconsistent with the patient's condition and not severe enough to induce traumatic arrest, consider a primary medical cause for the patient's cardiac arrest. B.If there is concern for a medical cause of the arrest, transport to the nearest cath lab capable facility if ROSC is achieved. If the patient is still in presumed medical cardiac arrest, then transport to the closest facility. C.Perform chest compressions in traumatic arrest, but DO NOT allow compressions to interfere with addressing the reversible causes of a traumatic arrest in the HAT resuscitation. D.Post-ROSC cooling in the traumatic arrest patient should be deferred to the hospi tal.Treatment - Created 5/22/19 Cardiac Arrest With Pregnancy (> 22 wee ks)- 10.050 Cardia c Arre st with Pregnancy (> 22 weeks) - 10.050 TREATMENT: Manage rhythm per appropriate cardiac arrest alg orithm (V -Fib/Pulseless VT, PEA, Asystole) IV/IO access should be above the diaphragm ( humera l IO or e xternal jugular access is preferred ). CPR with continuous manual left lateral uterine displacement using the two-handed method shown belo w (see Note G ). Ensure BVM ventilations are with high flow oxygen utilizing a two - handed technique to prevent gastric in flation . Suction should be readily available. Intubation should be managed with an endotracheal tube if possible and be performed by the most experienced provider using VL if available. Consider using an endotracheal tube 1 -2 sizes smaller than you woul d normall y use. Early transport is preferable regardless of ROSC status. The gravid u terus must remain displaced during transport. Continue the two-handed technique for uterine displacement (except in the presence of mecha nical CPR when th e patie nt can be attached to a board and the board is lifted 30 degrees in left lateral decubitus position). If patient is in cardiac arrest , notify and transport to the closest facility . Treatment - Created 5/22/19 Cardiac Arrest With Pregnancy (> 22 wee ks)- 10.050 Cardia c Arre st with Pregnancy (> 22 weeks) - 10.050 NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A. Consider e arly transport prior to achieving ROSC, especially if a mechanical CPR device is available. B. Alert the receiving facility ea rly in order to have an OB team present upon arrival in the emergency department. If you have not achieved ROSC , go to the closest facility regardless of OB capabilities . C. If ROSC has been achieved and maintained prior to, or during transport , bypass to an OB and NICU capab le facility. D. Lidocaine is preferable (Class B in Pregnancy) to amiodarone (Class C in Pregnancy) in the setting of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. E. In the setting of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventr icular tachycardi a, no adjustments need to be made to defibrillation energy settings. Immediately following defibrillation, resume the left lateral uterine displacement. F. If mecha nical CPR is in place, continue the left lateral uterine displacement by tilt ing the backboard 30\u00b0 to the left or by continuing manual displacement . G. If ROSC is achieved continue left lateral uterine displacement by placing the patient in the left lateral d ecubitus position or by manually displacing the gravid uterus. H. High flow oxyg en needs to be ma intaine d in all peri -arrest patients. I. Consider OG placement when possible.Airway Airway secured with ETT or supraglottic device (If no airway prior to ROSC, follow standard RSI procedures as appropriate) Titrate oxygen to SPO2 > 95% Ventilate 35- 45 mmH g-Do not hyperventi late Vital Signs Place patient on SPO2 monitor Obtain manual blood pressure and MAP Monitor ETCO2 (35-45 mmHg) Obtain 12- lead - If patient meets criteria, call for STEMI Activation Ongoing Care If no anti -dysrhythmic given before ROSC in v -fib/v-tach arrest, administer Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV/IO If amiodarone last anti -dysrhythmic given, re -dose 30 minutes after ROSC: 150 mg over 10 minutes If lidocaine was last anti -dysrhythmic given re -dose 0.75mg/kg every 10 minutes Maintain SBP > 90mmHg and MAP > 65mmHg Sedation and pain management as needed for the intubated patient Consider Push Dose Epi as a bridge to vasopressors as needed TREATMENT CHECKLIST: Treatment - Revised 1/27/2022 Cardiac Arrest (Post Resuscitation) - 10.050 Cardiac Arrest Post Resuscitation - 10.050 Package Patient for Transport Cardiac Arrest Post Resuscitation - 10.050 Cardiac Arrest (Post Resuscitation) - 10.050 Treatment - Revised 1/27/2022NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.In most cases, a patient who has return of spontaneous circulation should not be packaged for transport right away. This allows for hemodynamic stabilization of the patient. If the patient does arrest again, CPR is more effective at the scene than during transport. B.For transgender and non-binary patients, use sex assigned at birth for 12-leadd ECG computerized interpretation. C.Hyperventilation reduces venous return and may cause hypotension. Additional post-re suscitation hypotension include hypov olemia and pneumothorax especially in the presence of positiv e press ure ventilation. D.The condition of post-re suscitation patients fluctuates rapidly, and they require close monitoring E.Do not place a c-co llar on a patient post resuscitation as a measure to protect an airway; this can caus e an increas e in intracranial pressure. F.Do not use amiodarone or lidocaine in perfusing patients in the following situations without OLMC approval: 1.Systolic BP is les s than 90 mmHg. 2.Heart rate is less than 50 beats per minute. 3.Periods of sinus arrest are present. 4.Second or third-de gree heart block are per Universal Patient Care .

If capture is achieved and patient is uncomfortable, consider Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO to a MAX of 5 mg. May repeat once in 5 minutes. If capture is not achieved , try repositioning pads. Goal of therapy is to improve perfus ion.Treatment - Revised A.Hypoxia is a common cause of bradycardia. B.Bradycardia may be protective in the setting of cardiac ischemia and should only be treated if associated with serious signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion. Increasing heart rate may worsen ischemia or increase infarct size. C.Hyperkalemia may cause bradycardia. If the p atient has a wide complex bradycardia with a history of renal failure, muscular dystrophy, paraplegia, crush injury or serious burn > 48 hours prior, consider treatment per Hyperkalemia protocol. D.Immediate TCP can be considered in unstable patients when v ascular access is not available. E.TCP is at best a temporizing measure and is not useful in asystole. F.If TCP capture is not achieved, try repositioning pads. G.If capture is achieved with TCP and patient is experienc ing discomfort, administer midazolam 2.5 - 5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM /IN. May repeat once . Call OLMC for additional orders. H.Atropine will likely be ineffective in heart transplant recipients because they lack vagal innervation.

E.Be aware of atypical presentations including absence of chest pain in women, diabetic and geriatric patients.Chest Pain/Acute Coronary Syndrome - 10.065 Treatment - Revised 3/2/21 Chest Pain/Acute Coronary Syndrome - 10.070 FIELD IDENTIFIED ST-ELEVATION MI (STEMI) Indication: A.Patient diaphoresis, nausea/vomiting.) AND B.Diagnostic Quality 12-lead ECG with Paramedic interpretation of probable STEMI: > 1 mm ST elevation in any two or more contiguous leads (except V2, V3) > 2 mm ST elevation in V2, V3 QRS < 0.12 No Action: A.Rapid transport to destination hospital ED with interventional capability. B.Early notification of destination hospital and advise the receiving hospital of a \"STEMI Activation.\" C.If available, transmit 12-lead ECG to destination hospital. If transmission is unavailable, describe ECG to receiving hospital or contact OLMC. Notes & Precautions: A.T-waves will present as convex (domed or tombstone) in the setting of acute infarct. B.Computer Interpretation; Paramedics should not diagnose STEMI based solely on 12- lead computer interpretation. While the interpretation can be used to support your diagnosis, the computer is not infallible. The computer will not readall STEMIs as ***MEETS ST ELEVATION MI CRITERI A*** and the computer may read ***MEETS ST ELEVATION MI CRITERIA*** when the ECG is clearly not a STEMI. The computer is less accurate with wide QRS complexes,tachycardic rhythms, anterior MIs and STEMI imposters. C.STEMIs are often evolving. The STEMI may not appear until the 3rd 12- lead or the STEMI captured on 1st 12 -lead may disappear by arrival at the ED. A prehospital 12 -lead documenting the transient elevation is critical in these patients.Chest Pain/Acute Coronary Syndrome - 10.065 Treatment - Revised 3/2/21 Chest Pain/Acute Coronary Syndrome - 10.070 PRIORITY CARDIAC PATIENT (SALEM HOSPITAL ONLY) Indication: A.Salem Hospital may be advised of a \"Priority Cardiac Patient \" for clinically concerning orpotentially unstable patients that are cardiac in nature.

E.Treat pain per Pain Management protocol. PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: A.Treat pain per Pain Management pr otocol. B.Consider non -accidental trauma as a cause of injury. KEY CONSIDERATIONS: Mechanism of injury , previous medical history, medications and allergies, time of injury, quality of distal pulses, c apillary refill NOTES & PRECAUTIONS : *Use of tourniqu et for extremity hemorrhage is strongly recommended if sustained direct pressure is ineffective or impractical; Use a commercially produced , windlass, pneumatic, or ratcheting device, which has been demonstrated to occlude arterial flow and avoid narrow, e lastic, or bungee -type devices. Utilize improvised tourniquets only if no commercial device is available. If an improvised tourniquet is present before medical provider arrival, place a commercial tourniquet per protocol and remove the improvised tourniqu et if operationally feasible. # Apply a topical hemostatic agent, in combination with direct pressure, for wounds in anatomical areas where tourniquets cannot be applied, and sustained pressure alone is ineffective or impractical. Only apply topical hemo static agents in a gauze format that supports wound packing. Only utilize topical hemostatic agents that have been determined to be effective and safe in a standardized laboratory model. ## XSTAT is for the control of severe, life -threatening bleeding from junctional wounds in the groin or axilla that are not amenable to tourniquet applications in adults and adolescents. It should only be used for patients at high risk for immediate life - threatening bleeding from hemodynamically significant, non -compre ssible junctional wounds . 9/12/14 Musculoskeletal Spinal Injury - 10.100 Musculoskeletal Trauma - Spinal Injury - 10.100 TREATMENT: A.Treat per Universal Patient Care .

D.Complete physical and serial neurological exams after immobilization . E.Treat per Pain Management protocol. F.Regu larly assess the patient's respiratory status during transport. Loosen straps as needed to avoid respiratory compromise. PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: If using an adult backboard: A.Children may require extra padding under the upper torso to maintain neutral cervica l alignment. B.Consider using a short -spine device (OSS, KED) to immobilize the patient prior to placing on the backboard. NOTES & PRECAUTIONS A.Decreasing the use of backboards does not imply eliminating the use of spinal immobilization. B.Have a very low threshold for placing patients over 65 years of age in spinal precautions, even with a minor mechanism of injury. C.If any immobilization techniques cause an increase in pain or neurological deficits, nausea , or respiratory distress, immobilize and transport the patient in the position found or position of greatest comfort. D.For isolated penetrating head, neck, or torso trauma, immobilization of the cervical spine is unnecessary unless there is a neurologic deficit, or an adequate physical examination cannot b e performed (e.g. a patient with altered mental status or a patient with distracting injury ). E.For patients who are awake, alert and do not have neurological deficits, spinal precautions can be maintained by application of a rigid cervical collar and securi ng the patient firmly to a flat EMS stretcher.

If a person has had COPD or CHF in the past, it is likely the person has the same condition again. C.In cases of tachypnea consider causes such as pulmonary embolus, hypoxia, cardiac causes, infection , acidosis (DKA , sepsis ) and trauma. Apparent hyperventilation may be a response to a medical problem and should only be considered after these other causes have been excluded. Do not treat hyperventilation by rebreathing CO 2. Reassurance and oxygen via mask are appropriate. D.COPD and asthma patients receiving CPAP need to be monitored closely due to the higher risk of pneumothorax.

Treat per Universal Patient Care. B. If patient is actively seizing upon EMS arrival or having repetitive seizures without regaining consciousness: 1. Administer midazolam 5 mg IM. Repeat every 5 minutes until seizure stops. 2. If the patient already has an IV/IO, administer midazolam 2.5 - 5 mg IV/IO. Repeat every 5 minutes until seizure stops . 3. Monitor patient's respiratory status closely after m idazolam administration. C. Check blood glucose after first dose of midazolam and treat per Altered Mental Status protocol. D. Place patient on left side for transport. E. If the seizure activity does not stop after two doses of midazolam, transport to the closest hospital. F. Transport may be unnecessary if patient becomes fully oriented, is taking anti -seizure medication as prescribed, has a health care provider , and this is a typical seizure for the patient . If patient is not transported have the patient (or guardian) sign a Patient Information Form and document the patient's mental status. G. All first-time seizure patients require medical evaluation and should be transported . Contact OLMC if patient refuses . PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: A. If patient is actively seizing upon EMS arrival or having repetitive seizures without regaining consciousness: 1. Administer midazolam 0.3 mg/kg IM to a max of 5 mg. Repeat every 5 minutes until seizure stops . 2. If an IV /IO is available, may administer midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV/ IO to a max of 5 mg. Repeat ever y 5 minutes until seizure stops . B. Monitor patient's respiratory status closely after midazolam administration. C. Check blood glucose after first dose of midazolam and treat per Altered Mental Status protocol. D. Febrile seizures are generally found between the ages of 6 months - 6 years and are usually short in duration. E. If seizure does not stop after two doses of midazolam, transport to the closet hospital. Transport to a non- pediatric hospital may be necessary to get alternative antiepileptics. F. If, on arrival, the patient is not actively seizing (post -ictal) an IV is not required. G. All hypoglycemic or first-time pediatric seizure patients should be transported. NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A. Seizures in patients > 50 years of age can be caused by dysrhythmias . Monitor rhythm and t reat per appropriate protocol. Remember to check a pulse once a seizure stops. B. The longer status seizure lasts, the more difficult it is to control. Seizures that aren't responsive to midazolam may require alternative antiepileptic agents in a timely manner. C. New onset of seizures in a pregnant patient, especially in the third trimes ter, may indicate toxemia of pregnancy. Contact OLMC for consideration of magnesium sulfate.

It has little anti -inflammatory effect. It is metabolized into toxic and non -toxic products in the liver by : Glucuronidation (45-55%) Sulfate conjugation (20 -30%) N-hydroxylation and conjugation (less than 15%) All three pathways yield final products that are non -toxic. In the third pathway, however, the intermediate product NAPQI is toxic. At usual doses, NAPQI is quickly detoxified by conju gation with glutathione. In over dose, glutathione is used up and the toxic metabolite can cause potentially fatal liver damage . It is metabolized by the liver and is hepatotoxic . Toxicity is multiplied when combined with alcoholic drinks, and very likely in chronic alcoholics or patients with liver damage. INIDCATIONS: A.Mild to moderate pain. B.Fever D.Has taken in last 4 . ADULT & PEDIATRIC DOSING : Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO to maximum of 1000 mg Approximate dosing using 160 mg/5 mL liquid Weight Dose Volume 11 lbs/5kg 80 mg 2.5 mL 22 lbs/10 kg 160 mg 5 mL 45 lbs/20 kg 320 mg 10 mL 66 lbs/30 kg 480 mg 15 mL 88 lbs/40 kg 640 mg 20 mL 110 lbs/50 kg 800 mg 25 mL 130 lbs/60 kg 960 mg 30 mL Medications - Revised 9/15/20 Activated Charcoal - 20.010 Activated Charcoal - 20.010 OLMC REQUIRED: A.Aspirin and acetaminophen with time of ingestion > two hours. B.All other poisons or ingestions regardless of time from ingestion. SUPPLIED: 25 grams / 120 ml bottle. PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Activated charcoal adsorbs toxic substance s ingested and inhibits GI adsorption by forming an effective barrier between the particulate material and the gastrointestinal mucosa. The effect is greatest if used within one hour of ingestion. INDICATIONS: Management of poisoning or overdose of man y substances. CONTRAINDICATIONS: A.Patients with altered mental status or the inability to maintain their own airway. B.Patients who have aspirated or with a potential for aspiration. PRECAUTIONS: A.Activated charcoal may be ineffective in some inges tions. B.Milk, ice cream and other dairy products will decrease the adsorption capacity substantially. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: May cause nausea, vomiting, and constipation. ADULT DOSING : Poisoning & overdose - 1 gram / kg PO or OG to a max of 50 gram s. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Same as adult. Medications - Revised SUPPLIED: 6 mg / 2 ml and 12 mg / 4 ml pre -filled syringes PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Adenosine is a naturally occurring nucleoside that has the ability to slow conduction through the AV node. Since most cases of PSVT involve AV n odal re -entry, adenosine is capable of interrupting the AV nodal circuit and stopping the tachycardia, restoring normal sinus rhythm. It is eliminated from the circulation rapidly and has a half -life in the blood of less than ten seconds. INDICATIONS: To convert PSVT to a normal sinus rhythm, including PSVT that is associated with accessory bypass tracts (e.g. Wolff -Parkinson -White Syndrome). CONTRAINDICATIONS: A.Second- or third larger than 12 mg are given by injection, there may be a decrease in blood pressure secondary to a decrease in vascular resistance. B.The effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines such as theophylline and caffeine. Larger doses of adenosine may be required. C.Adenosine effects are potentiated by dipyridamole (Persantine) resulting in prolonged asystole. D.In the presence of carbamazepine (Tegretol), high degree heart block may occur. E.Adenosine is not effectiv e in converting atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or ventricular tachycardia. F.All doses of adenosine should be reduced to one -half (50%) in the following clinical settings: 1.History of cardiac transplantation. 2.Patients and dipyridamole (Persantine). 3.Administration through any central line. G.Adenosine should be used with caution in patients with asthma as it may cause a reactive airway response in some cases . SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: May cause facial flushing, shortne ss of breath, chest pressure, nausea, headache , and lightheadedness. ADULT DOSING : 6 mg rapid IV. May repeat with 12 mg IV x 2 if patient fails to convert after 6 mg dose. Use a large proximal IV site with fluid bolus flush. PEDIATRIC DOSING : 0.1 mg/kg rapid IV . May repeat with 0.2 mg/kg once if patient fails to convert after first dose. Use a large proximal IV site with fluid bolus flush. Medications - SUPPLIED: 2.5 mg / 3 ml vial individually or 3 mg packaged with 0.5 mg ipratropium (Duo - Neb). PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Albuterol is a potent, relatively selective beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilator and is associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate sensitivity from cells, especially MAST cells. The onset of improvement in pulmonary function is within 2 - 15 minutes after the initiation of treatment and the duration of action is from 4 - 6 hours. Albuterol has occasional beta-1 overlap with clinically significant cardiac effects. INDICATIONS: A.To treat bronchial asthma and reversible bronchial spasm that occ urs with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. B.To treat hyperkalemia. C.Chlorine patient's rhythm should be observed for arrhythmias. Stop treatment if frequent PVC's develop or any tachyarrhythmia s other than sinus tachycardia appears or if heart rate increases by more than 20 beats/minute. B.Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur wit h excessive administration. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: Clinically significant arrhythmias may occur, especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders such as coronary insufficiency and hypertension.

Diphenhydramine also has an anticholinergic and antiparkinsonian effect which is used to treat acute dystonic reactions to antipsychotic drugs (e.g. Haldol\u00ae, Thorazine\u00ae, Compazine\u00ae, Inapsine\u00ae). Thes e facial grimacing. INDICATIONS: A.The second -line drug in anaphylaxis and severe reactions (after epinephrine). B.To counteract acute dystonic and dysphoric reactions to anti dr ugs. CONTRAINDICATIONS: None PRECAUTIONS: A.May have an additive effect with alcohol or other CNS depressants. B.Although useful in acute dystonic reactions, it is not an antidote for anti -psychotic toxicity or overdose. C.May cause hypotension when given IV. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: Diphenhydramine is rarely necessary in the field. It is not the first -line drug for allergic reactions but may be useful for long transports. ADULT DOSING : Anaphylaxis, extrapyramidal symptoms - 1 mg/kg IV/IM to a max of 50 mg. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Anaphylaxis, extrapyramidal symptoms - 1 mg/kg IV/IM to a max of 50 mg. Medications - 6/20 Diltiazem - 20.095 Diltiazem - 20.095 OLMC REQUIRED: No 5 mg ml in 5 ml vial PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker. It slows conduction through the sinoatrial and AV node ; thus, slows ventricular response to the stimuli of rapid atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. I V dilt iazem is used primarily for ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Conversion to normal sinus rhythm often occurs . INDICATIONS: As a secondary medication to ad enosine in the setting of SVT if the p atient has a contra indication to adenosine use , or the patient wishes not to receive aden osine based on past experi ence.

Its actions differ with the dosage given: 1 - 2 mcg/kg/min - Dilates renal and mesenteric blood vessels. No effect on heart rate o r blood pressure. 2 - 10 mcg/kg/min - Beta effects on the heart, which usually increase s cardiac output without increasing heart rate or blood pressure. 10 - 20 mcg/kg/min - Alpha peripheral effects cause peripheral vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. INDICATIONS: A.Primary indication is cardiogenic shock. B.May be useful in other forms of shock, hypovolemic. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Hypovolemic shock . PRECAUTIONS: A.May induce tachyarrhythmia s, in which case infusion should be decreased or stopped. B.High doses may cause extreme peripheral vasoconstriction. Conversely, low doses may cause a decreased blood pres sure due to peripheral dilatation. C.Should not be added to sodium bicarbonate or other alkaline solutions since dopamine will be inactivated in alkaline solutions. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.The most common side effects include ectopic beats, nausea, and vomiting. B.Angina has been reported following treatment. C.Tachycardia and arrhythmias are less likely than with other catecholamines. D.Can precipitate hypertensive crisis in susceptible individuals (i.e. patients on MAO inhibitors such as Parnate, Nardil , or Marplan). E.Consider hypovolemia and treat this with appropriate fluids before administration of dopamine. F.Dopamine is best administered by infusion pump if available. Monitor closely. ADULT DOSING : Bradycardia - Begin at 2 mcg/ kg/min and incr ease as needed to a maximum of 10 mcg/ kg/min titrating to effect. Cardiogenic shock - 5 mcg/kg/min IV drip.

May repeat once in 10 min utes if necessary. Contact OLMC for additional doses. In the absence of Racepinephrine, you may substitute 5 ml (5 mg) of Epi 1:1000 via nebulizer . 10 ml PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Esmolol is beta -blocking agent. Esmolol is able to mitigate the depression of the VF threshold produced by high doses of epinephrine used during cardiac arrest due to its ability to dampen the sympathetic tone. Due to its quick onset and offset, it is ideal for these patients, without h aving the excessive/prolonged effects of the drug . INDICATIONS: Refractory ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular an anti-dysrhythmic medi cation . CONTRAINDICATIONS: None in the setting of cardiac arrest PRECAUTIONS: Ensure the patency of the IV/IO to prevent extravasation . SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.Esmolol is not to be used until both doses of an anti -dysrhythmic medication is administered, whether that is two dose of amiodarone or two doses of lidocaine. B.Esmolol is not compatible with sodium bicarbo nate. Flush IV/IO line before and after when used bicarbonate. ADULT repeat with another 0.5 mg/kg bolus i n 5 minutes.

Intravenous injection of etomidate produces hypnosis characterized by rapid onset of action; usually within one minute. Duration of hypnosis is dose dependent but relatively brief, usually 3 -5 minutes. INDICATIONS: A.As an induction agent B.As a sedation agent prior to synchronized unstable tachycardia . CONTRAINDICATIONS: Etomidate is contraindicated in patients who have a known hypersensitivity to the drug. . SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.The most frequent advers e reactions are transient injection site pain and transient skeletal muscle movements (myoclonus) . B.Etomidate may also cause nausea and/or vomiting. ADULT DOSING : Induction agent for rapid sequence intubation - 0.3 mg / kg IV/IO slow push. Synchronized cardioversion for unstable tachycardia - 0.15 mg / kg IV /IO push to a max of 10 mg . Wait 45 -60 seconds for signs of sedation such as patient becoming verbally unresponsive or no longer following commands. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Same as adult Medications - Revised ml PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid analgesic that produces analgesia and sedation. It is about 50 -100 times more potent than morphine on a weight basis. Onset of a ction when given is 2 -3 minutes. Peak effect occurs at 3 -5 minutes and lasts 15 -45 minutes. INDICATIONS: A.Pain due to musculoskeletal injury or depression . PRECAUTIONS: A.Fentanyl can cause respiratory depression that is reversible with naloxone. Respiratory depression can also be exacerbated by underlying lung disease and the use of other respiratory depressant drugs (benzodiazepines, alcohol, cyclic antidepressants). Have naloxone and respiratory support available when administering fentanyl. B.If administered rapidly and in very large doses, fentanyl can cause muscle spasm and ch est wall rigidity. The only reliable treatment for this is neuromuscular blockade. C.The action of fentanyl is prolonged, and its elimination is slower in the elderly. Smaller maintenance doses are advisable. D.Fentanyl must be used cautiously in patients who have already received morphine for prehospital analgesia. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.If hypotension develops, it is usually responsive to naloxone administration and Trendelenburg position. If hypotension continues, follow Shock protocol. B.Check and d ocument vital signs and patient response after each dose. C.The goal of fentanyl administration is patient comfort, not the total elimination of pain but the reduction in the perception of pain by the patient. ADULT DOSING : Pain Management - IV/IN - 50-100 mcg. May repeat 25 -50 mcg every 5 minutes as needed to a maximum of 500 mcg. IM - 50-100 mcg. May repeat every 15 minutes as needed to a maximum of 500 mcg . If BP < 100 mmHg and/or patient has minor altered mental status or respiratory depre ssion - first dose fentanyl is 25 mc g, may repeat 25 -50 mcg every 5 minutes to a maximum of 500 mcg. Monitor closely. Medications - Revised 9/15/20 - After airway placement, administer fentanyl 50 to 100 mcg IV/IO if systolic ( MAP i s >65 mmHg ). Repeat every 15 minutes as necessary to maintain analgesia. CPR Induced Consciousness - 50 mcg IV/IO used in conjunction with midazolam. May repeat every 5 - 10 minutes as needed PEDIATRIC DOSING : Pain Management - 1 mcg/kg IV . May rep eat with 0.5 -1 mcg/kg every 5 minutes as needed to a maximum of 4 m cg/kg. Or, 2 mcg/kg IN repeated with 1 mcg/kg every 5 minutes as needed to a maximum of 4 mcg/kg. If no IV/IN, may give fentanyl 1 -2 mcg/kg IM. May repeat every 15 minutes to a max of 4 mcg/kg. Do not exceed adult dosing. IN is preferred if no IV. Post -Intubation analgesia - After successful airway placement, administer fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV/IO, not to exceed the adult dose, with repeat doses at 0.5 - 1 mcg/kg every 15 minutes. Medications - Revised / 4 ml pre -filled syringe or 40 mg / 4 ml vial PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Furosemide is a potent diuretic with a rapid onset of action and short duration of effect. It acts primarily by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the kidney. Increase in potassium excretion occurs along with the sodium excretion. Peak effect is 30 - 60 minutes after IV administration with a duration of about 2 hours. (Duration if taken orally is 6 -8 hours with peak effect in 1 -2 hours) . INDICATIONS: In congestive heart failure to decrease the extracellular volume and reduce pressure on the lungs in cardiac failure. CONTRAINDICATIONS: A.Hypovolemia or hypotension. B.Pregnancy with res ultant shock and electrolyte depletion. Monitor patient closely after administration. B.Hypovolemia, hypotension, hyponatremia , and hypokalemia are the main toxic effects. Other toxic effects are usually not related to single -dose use. C.Patients who are on digitalis and are having arrhythmias consistent with digitalis toxicity (atrial tachycardia with conduction block, non -paroxysmal junction al tachycardia, sinus arrest, etc.) may need lower doses of furosemide. Contact OLMC. D.Because of the potency and need for close monitoring, furosemide should only be given with specific indications. E.Patients with Sympath etic Crashing Acute Pulmonary Edema (SCAPE) usually present with a sudden onset of extreme respiratory distress , diaphore sis, markedly elevated syst olic blood pressure > 160, tachycardia, and decreased oxygen saturat ion. Most of these patients are euv olemic and respond better to preload/afterload reduction ( Nitroglycerin SL every 5 minutes) in conjunction with CPAP. Furosemide is not helpful in SCAPE . ADULT DOSING : Respiratory distress from suspected congestive heart failure and evidence of volume overload and systolic BP > 100 mmHg - A.If patient is not currently taking furosemide, give 20 mg IV. B.If the patient is taking furosemide, give 40 mg IV. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Not indicated for pediatric patients . Contact OLMC Medications - Revised O LMC REQUIRED: No SUPPLIED: 1 mg vial of powder / 1 ml vial of diluent PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Glucagon is a hormone that causes glucose mobilization in the body. It works opposite to insulin, which causes glucose storage. It is released at times of insult or injury when glucose is needed and mobilizes glucose from body glycogen stores. Return to consciousness should be within 20 minutes of an IM dose if patient is hypoglycemic. INDICATIONS: A.Known hypoglycemia (preferably demonstrated by blood glucose determination) when patient is confused or comatose and dextrose is not available or an IVcannot be started. B.Anaphylaxis in patients with beta -blockade when epinephrine is ineffective. CO NTRAINDICATIONS: None PRECAUTIONS: IV Dextrose is the treatment of choice for hypoglycemia in the patient who cannot tolerate oral glucose. The use of g lucagon is restricted to patients who are seizing, comatose, combative, or with collapsed veins and in whom an IV cannot be s tarted. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.Nausea and vomiting may occur with administration. B.Persons with no liver glycogen stores (malnutrition, alcoholism) may not be abl e t o mobilize any glucose in response to g lucagon. ADULT DOSING: Hypoglycemia - 1 mg IM . Anaphylaxis (If epinephrine is ineffective in treating anaphylaxis in patients with beta- blockade)- 1 mg IM /IV. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Hypoglycemia - 0.02 mg/kg IM to a maximum of 1 mg . Medications - Revised 7/08 Glucose (Oral) - 20.140 Glucose (Oral) - 20.140 OLMC REQUIRED : No SUPPLIED: 15 - 24 grams glucose in gel tube s PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Glucose is the body's basic fuel and it produces most of the body's quick energy. Its use is regulated by insulin that stimulates storage of excess glucose from the bloodstream and glucagon that mobilizes stored glucose into the bloodstream. INDICATIONS: Oral glucose is indicated in the conscious patient where a suspicion of hypoglycemia exists, or a blood glucose measurement indicates a low blood glucose level . CONTRAINDICATIONS: Do not give to patients who cannot adequately protect their own airway. PRECAUTIONS: To give solutions orally, a patient must be continually assessed for the ability to protect his or her own airway. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOT ES: A.Research suggests that hyperglycemia may complicate, or worsen, a number of medical conditions (i.e. myocardial infarction, stroke). Oral glucose should be given to a conscious patient whenever hypoglycemia is documented by blood glucose meter. If th ese objective findings are not available, the EMT should use judgment based on signs and history. B.Effects will be delayed in the elderly and people with poor circulation. C.May be more tolerable if administered with liquid between dosages . D.Patient's conditio n may require more than one dose of oral glucose. ADULT DOSING : Hypoglycemia - One tube or equivalent. Repeat as needed. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Same as adult Medications - Revised 4 /30/2019 ml vial PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Haloperidol is an antipsychotic that ma y be used as a chemical restraint by produc ing marked sedation and allay ing apprehension. It also provides a state of mental detachment a nd indifference while maintaining a state of reflex alertness. Haloperidol may potentiate the effects of other CNS depressants. It also causes mild alpha- adrenergic blockade which can le ad to peripheral vasodilatation and hypo tension, as well as a reductio n of the pressor effect of catecholamines . It is also a very effective anti-emetic . The onset of action of a single IV dose is from 5 -15 minutes following administration, and the peak effect may not be apparent for up to 30 minutes. Duration is generall y from 2 -6 hours. INDICATIONS: A.Sedation of to faci allergy to haloperidol PRECAUTIONS: A.Hypotension may occur; IV fluids and other measures to manage hypotension should be readily available. B.Use caution when administering haloperidol to pa tients who have taken other CNS depressant drugs (barbiturates, benzodiazepines , alcohol). C.Haloperidol may induce Torsade de Pointes. Monitor the patient's ECG Q -T interval following us e. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.The most common side effects ar e hypotension and tachycardia, which usually respond s to a fluid bolus. B.Dysphoric (restlessness) and dystonic reactions have been reported following administration. These symptoms can be treated with the administration of diphenhydramine. C.Haloperidol should be used with caution in patients with a seizure disorder or condition that causes seizures; other similar neuroleptics are known to lower the seizure threshold. ADULT DOSING : Patient restra int - 5-10 mg IV, IO, IM. May repeat to a maximum of 20 mg. Nausea an d vomiting 1.25 mg IV/IM PEDIATRIC DOSING : Contact O LMC for OLMC REQUIRED: Repeat dose for pediatric patients. SUPPLIED: 5 grams powder i n vial for reconstitution with 2 00 ml NS. Kit has one vial. PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12a) is an effective antidote in the treatment of cyanide poisoning based on its abili ty to bind cyanide ions. Each h ydroxocobalamin molecule can bind one cyanide ion to form cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), which is then excreted in the urine. Cyanide is an extremely potent toxic poison. In the absence of rapid and adequate treatment, exposure to a high dose of cyanide can result in death within minutes due to inhibition of cytochrome oxidase resulting in arrest of cellular respiration. INDICATIONS: Cyanide poisoning or smoke inhalation wi th suspected cyanide poisoning due to the presence of coma, persistent hypotension , or cardiorespiratory arrest. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Do not administer hydroxocobalamin and sodium thiosulfate to the same patient. PRECAUTIONS: Hydroxocobalamin has physical (particulate) and chemical incompatibilities with many medications and it is best to administer other drugs or products (e.g. blood) through a separate intravenous line. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.The most frequently occurring side effects are chromaturia (red colored urine) and erythema (skin redness) which occur in nearly all patients. B.Other reported serious side effects include allergic reactions, temporary increases in blood pressure, nausea, headache , and infusion site reactions. C.Because of its deep red color, hydroxocobalamin has also been found to interfere with certain laboratory tests based on light absorption including co -oximetric measurements or carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin , and oxy hemoglobin. ADULT DOSING : Cyanide poisoning or smoke inhalation with suspected cyanide poisoning - 5 grams IV or IO over 15 minutes. Repeat once if needed. For cardiac arrest, hydroxocobalamin should be administered as a rapid fluid bolus. PEDIATRIC DOSING: Cyanide poisoning or smoke inhalation with suspected cyanide poisoning - 70 mg /kg IV or IO to a max of 5 g over 15 minutes. For cardiac arrest, hydroxocobalamin should be administered as a rapid fluid bolus. Contact OLMC regarding second dose. Medications - 20.147 OLMC REQUIRED: Liquid - 100 mg / 5 mL (Children's) ; 50 mg / 1.25 mL (Infant's) ; 200 mg tablets, capsules PHARMACOLCOGY AND ACTIONS : Ibuprofen, from isobutylphenyl propionic acid, is a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for reliev ing pain, lowering fever , and reducing inflammation . Like other NSAIDs, it works by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, involved in mediating inflammation (swelling), pain, and fever. It achieves this effect on prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that is present in various tissues of the body. INDICATIONS: A.Mild to reaction after taking aspirin or other NSAID. C.Recent heart surgery. D.Has taken ibuprofen in last 6 hours . E.Unable to take oral medication . F.Any signs of dehydration in pediatric patients . G.Patient s less than 6 months old. PRECAUTIONS: Ibuprofen may cause a severe allergic reaction, especially in p eople who are allergic to aspirin. May cause stomach bleeding especially in patients: Older than 60 y ears Who have had stomach ulcers or bleeding problems Take blood thinners Take other medications containing NSAIDs.

PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Ipratropium is an atropine derivative used for inhalation therapy. For severe asthma, ipratropium taken in addit ion to a short acting beta agonist (such as albuterol) can provide greater bronchodilation and clinical benefit than the beta agonist alone. It has no anti -inflammatory effects and does not decrease bronchial hyper -responsiveness. INDICATIONS: As a s upplement to albuterol in patients with asthma and COPD. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Do not use in patients with severe glaucoma. PRECAUTIONS: Ipratropium in the meter dose inhaler and auto -inhaler formulations should not be administered to individuals aller gic to soy lecithin or related food products (e.g. soybeans , peanuts). The nebulized formulation may be administered to these patients. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.Dry mouth. B.Pharyngeal irritation. C.Increased intra - 3.0 mg albuterol/ 0.5 mg ipratropium) via nebulizer. Repeat as needed X 2. Do not administer more than three tot al treatments. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Same as adult dosing Medications - Revised - 10/25/2021 Ketamine Hydrochloride Ketamine is a NDMA receptor antagonist, that is structurally similar to phencyclidine (PCP), that acts as a dissociative anesthetic agent by interrupting the connection between the thalamo -neocortical tracts and the limbic system in the brain, producing anesthesia. In addition, it has analgesic effects and can be used at low er doses for pain control - without causing anesthesia. It also stimulates catecholamine release from the adrenal glands causing an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output. Ketamine is also a bronchodilator and is a useful induction ag ent when intubating patients with severe bronchospasm. INDICATIONS: A.As an induction agent for use in rapid or delayed sequence intubation (RSI or DSI) . B.Pain management C.Non-traumatic chest pain. D.Patients with a history of schizophrenia or history of psychosis . SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.Increased blood pressure due to catecholamine release. B.Emergence reaction can occur in 5 -30% of patients. Duration of action is 10 -20 minutes IV and co ntinued sedation must be provided before t he induction agent wears off . ADULT DOSING: Pain management - A.12.5 - 25 mg IV/IO slow push over 5 minutes , or by IV infusion over 1 5 minute s, or 25 - 50 mg IM. May repeat once after 30 min unless patient develops nystagmus, hallucinations , or dysphoric symptoms. B.Ketamine must be diluted prior to IV or IO administration for pain management. Either d ilute 12.5 mg in 9. 75 ml or 25 mg in 9.5 ml of normal saline for slow IVP or dilute 12.5 - 25 mg in 100 ml of Normal Saline and infuse over 1 5 minutes. Induction agent for RSI or DSI - 1 - 2 mg/kg IV/IO slow push over 1 minute. Dilute Ketamine with normal saline to a minimum of 10 ml total volume for a slower administration.

Medications - Revised 3/24/21 Labetalol - 20.159 Labetalol 100 solution in pre -filled syringe PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Lidocaine depresses the automaticity of Purkinje fibers, raising stimulation threshold in the ventricular muscle fibers whic h makes the ventricles less likely to fibrillate. It has little antiarrhythmic effect on the atrial muscle in normal doses. The effect of a single bolus on the heart disappears in 10 -20 minutes due to redistribution in the body. The m etabolic half -life of lidocaine is about 2 in a suspected ischemic ev ent. D.Pain management following IO placement. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Do not use in perfusing pts in the following sit uations without OLMC approval: A.Systolic BP is less than 90 mmHg. B.Heart rate is less than 50 beats per minute.

It also causes significant antegrade amnesia when administered IV. INDICATIO NS: A.Status seizure (any seizure that has lasted longer than 2 minutes or two consecutive seizures without regaining consciousness) B.To relieve anxiety and produce amnesia during cardioversion, pacing paralytic intubation. C.To facilitate restraint in pati ents whose cause of agitation is likely drug ingestion (especially stimulants), withdrawal, or from a postictal state. D.CPR Induced Consciousness. CONTRAINDICATIONS: In seizures, do not give unless patient is actively seizing. PRECAUTIONS: Midazolam ca uses respiratory depression and/or hypotension especially if administered rapidly. Monitor patient closely. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.Common side effects include drowsiness, hypotension, respiratory depression , and apnea. These are more likely to occur in the very young and the elderly. Rarely, patients may experience paradoxical agitation. B.Respiratory depression is more likely in patients who have taken other CNS depressant drugs such as opioids alcohol and barbiturates, or when given rapidly. C.Midazo lam is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidney. Doses should be adjusted accordingly in patients with underlying hepatic or renal diseases and low flow states such as congestive heart failure. ADULT DOSING : Seizures - 2.5 - 5 mg IV/IO or 10 mg IM /IN. Repeat every 5 minutes until seizure stops. Chemical restraint - Refer to Patient Restraint protocol (30.120) for dosing .

May repeat once after 5 minutes * Call OLMC for additional orders.Medications - Revised 10/28/14 narcotic analgesic that induces drowsiness, mental clouding , and mood changes. It also increases venous capacitance, decreases venous blood return (preload) , and mic vascular resistance at the arteriolar level (afterload). This may lead to decreases in myocardial oxygen demand. Onset of action when given IV is 2 -3 minutes and peak effect occurs at 7 -10 minutes. Duration is 3 -5 hours. INDICATIONS: A.Suspected isch emic chest pain unresponsive burns or musculoskeletal injury. CONTRAINDICATIONS: A.Known less than 100 mmHg systolic. C.Trauma or pain of the head or abdomen. D.Respiratory rate less than 14 breaths per minute or oxygen saturation less than 90%. For pediatric patients, vital signs should be maintained within the normal age -appropriate range. PRECAUTIONS: A.Morphine causes respiratory depression that is reversible with naloxone. This respiratory depression is exacerbated by underlying lung disease (COPD, etc.) and other depressant drugs (Valium, alcohol, cyclic anti -depressants). Naloxone and respiratory support must be available when using morphine. B.If hypotension develops, it is usually responsive to naloxone administration and Trendelenburg position. If hypotension persists, follow Shock protocol. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.The goal of morphine administration is patient comfort (not the total elimin ation of pain but reduction in perception of pain by the patient). B.Morphine is a Schedule II controlled substance. Follow your agencies Controlled Substance policy or procedure for control and monitoring of use. ADULT DOSING : Pain - Musculoskeletal inj uries, burns, chest pain - 2-8 mg IV. Repeat every 5 to max of 20 mg . If no IV give 5 -10 mg IM.

Duration of effect is 1 -4 hours. INDICATIONS: A.Reversal of opioid effects, particularly respiratory depression, due to opioid drugs either ingested or injected or administered during etiology to rule out or reverse opioid depression. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Do not use in neonates. PRECAUTIONS: A.In patients physically dependent on opioids, violent withdrawal symptoms may occur. Be prepared to restrain the patient. B.Some opioid intoxications may require up to 8 mg of naloxone to reverse symptoms (e.g. methadone, carfentanil ). SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.The duration of some opioids is longer than naloxone, repeat doses may be necessary. Monitor the patient closely. Patients who have received naloxone must be transported to the hospital because coma may reoccur when naloxone wears off. B.Side effects are rare. Do not hesitate to use if indicated. C.If no effect is seen from naloxone administration, consider other causes of coma. ADULT DOSING : Reversal of opioid effects, coma of unknown etiology - 0.5 mg IV. R epeat every 2 minutes up to 2 mg titrating to respiratory rate. If no IV, give 2 mg IM/IN. If no response to initial dose and opiate intoxication is still suspected, repeat 2 mg IV/IM/IN every 3 -5 minutes up to a maximum of 8 mg total. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Reversal of opioid effects, coma of unknown etiology - 0.1 mg / kg IV/IM/IN up to 2 mg. May repeat q 3 - 5 minutes up to 2 mg / dose. Max total dose 8 mg. Do not use in ne onates . CONTRAINDICATIONS: transports . SU PPLIED: Infusion solution 20 mg/200 ml Infusion solution 40 mg/200 ml PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Calcium -channel blocker ions across membranes of myocardial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells without changing serum calcium concentrations.

I NDICATIONS: Interfacility Transport Only: blood pressure control for CVA patients systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 105 mmHg. PRECAUTIONS: A.May cause symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia. B.Titrate slowly to avoid symptomatic hypotension and possible negative inotropic effects with CHF, angina, ventricular possibility of venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascularimpairment, do not use small veins such as those on the dorsum of hand or wrist. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: Common side effects are headache, flushing, dizziness , peripheral edema, polyuria. ADULT DOSING: Hospital Initiated Infusion for Interfacility Transport to Comprehensive Stroke Center: 2.5 mg/hour titrated q. 5 minutes to reach target of systolic blood pressure < 180 mmH g and di astolic blood pressure < 105 mmHg. Max dose is 15 mg/hour. Medications - Revised 3/24/21 Nicardipine - spra y, 0.4 mg tablets , 50 mg/10 ml vial PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator. It is a smooth muscle relaxant that reduces venous tone causing pooling of blood in the peripheral veins, decreasing peripheral resistance and thereby decreasing cardiac preload. It also causes mild dilation of the coronary arteries. INDICATIONS: A.Presumed . (ST elevation in or other simil within 24 hours, or who have taken Cilais\u00ae (tadalafil) within 48 hours. Contact OLMC for direction. PRECAUTIONS: A.Generalized vasodilatation can cause profound hypotension and reflex tachycardia. B.IV should be established prior to administration i n patients who have not taken nitroglycerin previously, or who have a potential for hemodynamic instability. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.Common side effects are headache, flushing , or dizziness. B.Because nitroglycerin causes generalized smooth muscle relaxat ion, may reliev e chest pain caused by esophageal spasm. ADULT DOSING: Chest pain - 0.4 mg SL every 5 minutes until pain is relieved as long as systolic BP is greater than 100 mmHg. Decompensated heart failure - Nitroglycerine 0.4 mg SL; repeat every 3 -5 minutes. (Do not administer nitroglycerine without OLMC approval ( Levitra\u00ae ) or the last 24 hours, or tadalafil (Cialis\u00ae ) within the last 48 hours ).

Concurrent beta receptor stimulation may produce increases in heart rate and mild bronchodilation. INDICATIONS: Obstructive, cardiogenic and distributive shock Hypovolemic shock . PRECAUTIONS: A.Norepinephrine sh ould be given in a large, patent vein (i.e. antecubital or larger). Do not administer through a hand or leg vein, as these are more likely to be affected by vaso -occlusive diseases and more prone to ischemic complications. B.Extravasation of norepinephrine into tissue may cause necrosis. The IV should be checked for patency prior to administration and monitored continuously. C.Norepinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor and may cause hypertension. The rate of flow should be carefully monitored, and blood pre ssures checked often. D.Consider hypovolemia and treat this with appropriate fluids before administration of norepinephrine. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.Symptoms may include headache, palpitations, tachycardia, chest pain , and eventual hypertension. B.Reflex b radycardia can result from an increase in blood pressure. ADULT DOSING : Cardiogenic /Distributive/Obstructive shock - Begin at 4 mcg/min . If no response, increase every 5 minutes in 4 mcg/min increments to max of 12 mcg/min. Goal is a systolic blood pr essure of > 90 mmHg. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Begin at 0.1 mc g/kg/min. If no response in 5 min, increase to 0.2 mcg/kg/min.

SUPPLIED: 4 mg oral tablet ; 4 mg / 2 ml vial PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Ondansetron is a potent, highly selective serotonin (5 -HT3) rece ptor agonist. Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea is not known. Pharmacologic agents and other triggers may cause release of 5 -HT3 receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Ondansetron is commonly used in the treatmen t of nausea in patients who are receiving chemotherapy or as a postoperative nausea treatment. Peak plasma concentrations of the drug occur 10 minutes after IV administration, and 40 minutes after IM injection. Both routes have the same elimination half -life of 4 hours. INDICATIONS: Prevention and control of uncomplicated nausea and vomiting. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Known hypersensitivity to Zofran or similar medications. PRECAUTIONS: A.Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other 5 -HT3 medications (Anzemet\u00ae, Kytril\u00ae) . B.Patients with bowel obstruction should be monitored closely following administration. C.Ondansetron may precipitate if mixed with alkaline solutions.

These effects may occur several hours after use. ADULT DOSING : Chemical burns or foreign body to outer eye - Instill o ne drop in the affected eye . If there is no effect within one minute, three additional drops may be instilled at one -minute intervals. For transports longer than 15 minutes, if eye pain returns, 1 -4 additional drops may be instilled to continue anesthetic effect. PEDIATRIC DOSIN G: Same as adult 10 m L vial PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Rocuronium is a non -depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent causing skeletal muscle relaxation. Rocuronium produces a pure reversible competition between antagonist molecule s and acetylcholine (Ach) for occupancy at the Ach binding site. Neuromuscular blockade occurs within 90 seconds for induction dose and 1 to 3 minutes for maintenance dose. Time to recovery is 20 to 30 minutes. Metabolism is 5 to 35% renal and the remainde r by the liver. INDICATIONS: A.For sustained neuromuscular the intubated patient. (RSI /DSI) in contraindicated or unavailable . CONTRAINDICATION: Maintainance in status PRECAUTIONS: A.Use of pulse oximetry i s required. B.Rocuronium does not substantia lly affect heart rate or rhythm, systol ic or diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressur e, cardiac output , or systemic vascular resistance. C.Rocuroniu m has no effect on consciousness and must be used with a sedative or induction agent. D.Rocuronium should not be administered simultaneously furosemide, methylprednisolone, or sodium bicarbonate. ADULT AND PEDS DOSING : Maintenance of post -intubat ion paralysis - mg/kg IV/IO. Induction for intubation - 1.2 mg/kg Bicarbonate and ml pre -filled syringe PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Sodium bicarbonate is an alkalotic solution which neutralizes acids found in the blood. Acids are increased in the blood when body tissues become hypoxic due to cardiac or respiratory arrest. Acidosis depresses cardiac contractility and cardiac response to catec holamine s and makes the heart more likely to fibrillate and less likely to defibrillate. In the non -perfusing patient sodium bicarbonate has been shown to increase the intracellular acidosis and worsen acid/base balance, thus it is not recommended in the routine cardiac arrest sequence. INDICATIONS: A.To control arrhythmias or asystole in cyclic antidepressant C.Chlorine injury. CONTRAINDICATIONS: None PRECAUTIONS: A.Addition of too much bicarbonate may result in alkalosis that is difficult to reverse and may cause as many problems in resuscitation as acidosis. B.May increase cerebral acidosis, especially in diabetics who are ketotic. C.Do not mix sodium bicarbonate with calcium preparations. Slowly flush one drug from the catheter before administering the other. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: Each amp of sodium bicarbonate contains 50 mEq of sodium. This may increase intravascular volume and hyperosmolarity resulting in cerebral impairment. ADULT DOSING : Sodium Channel Blockade overdose (Tricyclic Antidepressants, Diphenhydramine, or 1c IO V-Fib, pulseless V -Tach, PEA, asystole - 1 mEq/kg IV or IO .

Chlorine Inhalation - 2.5 ml of 8.4% Sodium Bicarbonate via nebulizer Medications - Revised 1 0/26/21 Bicarbonate 20.260 Bicarbonate - 20.260 PEDIATRIC DOSING : A.Use same dosing as for adult with exception of hyperkalemia and crush injury , call OLMC for dosing in that situation. B.For children less than 10 kg (1 yr.), dilute by one -half with normal saline prior to administration.Medications - Revised 20.265 OLMC REQUIRED: All situations. SUPPLIED: 12.5 grams / 50 ml vial PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Sodium Thiosulfate is used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning. The primary mechanism of cyanide detoxification involves the conversion of cyanide to the thiocyanate ion, which is relatively non -toxic. This reaction involves the enzyme rhodanese which is found in ma ny body tissues but with the major activity in the liver. The body has the capability to detoxify cyanide, however, the rhodanese enzyme system is slow to respond to large amounts of cyanide. The rhodanese enzyme reaction can be accelerated by supplying an exogenous source of sulfur. This is commonly accomplished by administering sodium thiosulfate. INDICATIONS: Cyanide poisoning. CONTRAINDIC ATIONS: Do not administer to a patient who has been given hydoxocobalimin (Cyano -Kit). PRECAUTIONS: A.Sodium Thiosulfate is essentially non -toxic. However, some animal studies showed that a constant infusion of Sodium Thiosulfate led to hypovolemia which was considered due to an osmotic effect. B.It is not known whether Sodium Thiosulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and should only be administered in this setting if clearly needed. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: Sodium thiosulfate is administered as a slow push over 10 minutes. Consider using a Buretrol\u00ae or similar device. ADULT DOSING : Cyanide poisoning - 50 ml slow IV over 10 -20 minutes. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Cyanide poisoning - 1.65 ml/kg slow IV over 10 -20 minutes. Medications - Revised Succinylcholine 10 ml vial PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Succinylcholine is a short acting motor nerve depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. It competes with acetylcholine to combine with cholinergic receptors in the motor end pla te causing depolarization inhibiting neuromuscular transmission. After intravenous injection, paralysis is obtained within 1 -2 minutes and persists for approximately 4 -6 minutes. Effects then start to fade and return to normal. It has no effect on consc iousness. Muscle relaxation begins in the eyelids and jaw, then progresses to the limbs, abdomen, diaphragm and finally intercostal muscles. Succinylcholine is hydrolyzed by plasma pseudocholinesterase and is excreted by the kidneys. INDICATIONS: To achieve temporary paralysis where endotracheal intubation is indicated. CONTRAINDICATIONS: A.Hypersensitivity to the drug. B.Major burns and crush injuries between 48 hours and 6 months old. C.Stroke or spinal cord injuries with profound residual defecits bet ween 48 hours and 6 months old. D.Neuromuscular disease (e.g. muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis) . E.Suspected hyperkalemia (e.g. end -stage renal disease patients who have missed dialysis ). PRECAUTIONS: A.Succinylcholine shall not be administered unless pe rsonnel trained and authorized in this procedure are present and ready to perform the procedure. B.Oxygen, ventilation equipment , and resuscitation drugs should be readily available. C.Succinylcholine produces paralysis but does not alter a person's level of consciousness. Paralysis in the conscious patient is very frightening, therefore, sedation should be provided to the patient during the procedure. Verbal explanations should be provided to the patient during the procedure, even if you do not think they ca n hear you. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: In rare individuals, because of pseudocholinesterase deficiency, paralysis may persist for a prolonged period . Be prepared to continue to assist ventilations as needed. ADULT DOSING : Rapid or delayed sequence intuba tion - 1.5 mg/kg IV/IO PEDIATRIC DOSING : Rapid or delayed sequence intubation - 1.5 mg/kg IV/IO for patients > 6 years old. 2 mg/ kg IV/IO for patients < 6 years old. Medications - Created 10/27/2021 Tranexamic Acid (TXA) LMC REQUIRED: No SU PPLIED: 1000 mg (1 gram) / 10 ml vial P HARMACOL OGY AND ACTIONS : Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine. It reversibly binds to lysine receptor sites on plasminogen to decrease the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. This antifibrinolytic effect reduces breakdown of fibrin and helps to stabilize clots to reduce bleeding. TXA also has anti -inflammatory properties. I NDICATIONS: A.Moderate to severe head trauma, either blunt or penetrating, in patients wit h a GC S 12 and with a r eactive pupil . B.Hemorrhagic shock from blunt or penetrating trauma with a systolic bl ood pr essure < 70 mmHg. C.Postpartum hemorrhage. CO NTRAINDICATIONS A. Patients less than 15 years old (or weight < 50 kg if age unknown) B. > 2 hours from time of injury for hemorrhagic shock or TBI C. GCS of 3 with no reactive pupil D. Any chest compressions (manual or mechanical) E.Patients with clinical concern for epilepsy /seizures, MI, stroke, PE, DVT, renal failure, or dialysis F. Known or suspected pregnancy G. Drowning H. Hanging I. Burns > 20% TBSA J. Other procoagulant ( e.g., KCENTRA) drug already administered P RECAUTIONS AND SIDE EFFECTS : A.Hypotension has been observed with rapid IV injection. B. TXA, by causing clots to get stronger , can make MI, stroke, PE , and DVTs more challenging to manage . C.TXA is renally cleared , so its use in patients with known renal failure or dialysis should be avoided. D.Reported s ide effects have included seizures, nausea, vomiting, and chest pain. A DULT DOSING (Age 15): Head trauma, hemorrhagic shock, or postpartum hemorrhage: 2 g in 10 ml (100 mg/mL) IV at 1 ml per minute ( i.e., administered over 10 minutes). Optional method : (Mix 2 grams in 100 ml of NS and infuse over 10 minutes via drip or pum p.) P EDIATRIC DOSING : Not indicated in patients < 15 years of age . Medications - Revised SUPPLIED: 10 mg vial of powder and 10 ml vial of diluent solution PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: Vecuronium is a non -depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent causing skeletal muscle relaxation. It reversibly binds the acetylcholine re ceptor, blocking the action of acetylcholine. Neuromuscular blockade occurs within 2 -3 minutes. Time to recovery is 30-45 minutes. Vecuronium metabolism is 5 -35% renal with the remainder done in the liver. INDICATIONS: A.For sustained neuromuscular block ade in the intubated patient. B.As the first line agent for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) or delayed sequence intubation (DSI) in the patient where succinylcholine is contraindicated . PRECAUTIONS: A.Patients with ren al or hepatic failure may experience prolonged paralysis. B.Vecuronium has no effect on consciousness and must be used with a sedative or induction agent. SIDE EFFECTS AND NOTES: A.Vecuronium exhibits minimal side effec ts and does not substantially affect h eart rate or rhythm, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, or systemic vascular resistance. B.Vecuronium can be used to maintain paralysis even if intubation was performed without Succinylcholine. ADULT DOSING : 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Same as adults. Medications when reconstituted PHARMACOLOGY AND ACTIONS: A.Antipsychotic. B.The mechanism of action of ziprasidone is unknown. However, it is thought to be through blocking of dopamine and serotonin receptors prod ucing sedation and tranquilization. C.Onset of action of a single IM dose is from 15 to 30 minutes and duration of action is 2 -4 hours. The peak effect may not be apparent for up to 2 hours. INDICATIONS: Chemical restraint in combative patients. CONTRA INDICATIONS: Known allergy . PRECAUTIONS: A.May cause hypotension. Treat shock per protocol when feasible. B.Use caution when administering ziprasidone to patients who have taken other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. sedative -hypnotics, alcohol). Consider red uced doses in these cases . C.May induce Torsades de Pointes. Monitor ECG and Q -T interval following use, if feasible. D.Extrapyramidal symptoms have been reported. If sever e, treat with diphenhydramine 1 mg /kg IV/IM to a m ax of 50 mg . E.Use with caution in pa tients with a seizure disor der or condition that causes seizures. NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.Somnolence, dizziness, headache, and nausea have occurred following administration. These are not life threatening and generally do not require treatment. B.Reconstituti on: Add 1.2 m l sterile water for injection and shake vigorously until completely dissolved. 1 ml = 20mg of ziprasidone . ADULT DOSING : Patient Restraint - 10 - 20 mg IM . (IM ONLY) Do not repeat. PEDIATRIC DOSING : Contact OLMC . Regional EMS Patient Treatment Protocols - 2023 Section 30.000 Procedures Procedures - Revised 8/30/16 Airway Management / General - 30.010 Airway Management / General - 30.010 PURPOSE : Proper airway management is the first priority of the EMS Provider/Paramedic. INDICATIONS: A.Airway control and protection. B.Inadequate ventilation Airway and Ventilation: A.Supplemental oxygen: 1.A Na sal cannula is useful for small amounts of supplemental oxygen. 2.Partial Rebreather masks (PRB) are recommended when higher flow and concentrations of oxygen need to be delivered. 3.\"Blow -by\" oxygen should be used for infants and toddlers. B.Nasopharyngeal Air ways (NPA) or Oropharyngeal Airway s (OPA) should be used for patients who are unable to maintain their own airway. C.A Bag -Valve -Mask (BVM) should be used when inadequate ventilation is present. D.CPAP should be considered for MEDICAL patients complaining of moderate to severe respiratory distress meeting ALL the criteria described in the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) procedure. E.Continuous End-tidal CO 2 shall be utilized on all intubated patients. F.PEEP valve should be considered when ventilati ng a patient with COPD or emphysema to maintain alveolar inflation during exhalation . NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: In trauma patients, airway maintenance with cervical spine control is the primary concern. If unable to establish or maintain an airway, transport the patient to the closest hospital. This includes patients entered into the Trauma System. Procedures - Revised 7/08 AICD Deactivation - 30.020 AICD Deactivation - 30.020 DEFINITION: An AICD is an implanted defibrillator device that consists of a lead system that senses cardiac activity, logic circuitry to analyze sensed signals, a power supply for device function and generating high voltage, and a capacitor that stores an d delivers shocks. This device activates when brady and/or tachyarrhythmias are detected within programmed parameters. INDICATIONS: Consider application of a magnet to deactivate an implanted cardioverter defibrillator that is firing inappropriately. Call OLMC prior to application . Inhibition of AICD devices should be considered when continuous ECG monitoring verifies malfunction and ACLS is readily available. PROCEDURE: A.Contact OLMC. B.Monitor ECG and verify sinus rhythm AND inappropriate defibrillato r discharge. C.Locate the position of the AICD device. D.Place doughnut magnet directly over the device. E.After proper positioning and AICD deactivation, tape magnet securely in place and transport. NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.It is very important to make the correct diagnosis before utilizing this protocol. Be sure that the ECG is showing a normal sinus rhythm without ectopy AND indications of recurrent AICD discharges. B.Some AICD devices will emit varying beeping or continuous tones when magnets are applied, other w ill not. Disregard these tones. C.If the magnet placement is successful in overriding the pulse generation of the AICD, DO NOT REMOVE THE MAGNET . Some units will return to normal operation after removal from the magnetic field. D.Magnets should be stored so as not to come into contact with magnetic sensitive materials, i.e., monitor screens, tapes, credit cards, magnetic door entry cards, and other electronic equipment. E.A small percentage of AICDs are impervious to magnetic fields (AICD recipients who normall y work around magnetic fields have these special units). Th ese will not be deactivated with the doughnut magnet. In such cases, advise OLMC and transport. F.Consider use of the AICD magnet in deactivating cardiac pacemaker malfunctions. Application of a ma gnet to a pacemaker changes the pacing to asynchronous mode but will not turn off the pacemaker. Call OLMC prior to application. G.Identification information of the AICD type, date implanted, and location of implantation should accompany the patient to the hospital. This information is typically found on a wallet card that the patient has.Procedures - Revised 9/17/21 Continuous Positive Airway Pressure - 30.032 Continuous Positive Airway Pressure - 30.032 DEFINITION: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) has been shown to rapidly improve vital signs, gas exchange, and to decrease the work of breathing, the sense of dyspnea, and the need for endotracheal intubation in patients who suffer from shortness of breath to CHF/Pulmonary edema , hemodynamics by reducing preload and afterload.

G.Check for air leaks. H.Monitor and document the patient's respiratory response to the treatment. I.Continue to coach patient to keep mask in place and readjust as needed to a maximum of 10 cmH 2O. J.IF RESPIRATORY STATUS DETERIORATES, REMOVE THE DEVICE AND CONSIDER BAG VALVE MASK VENTILATION AND/OR ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION. REMOVAL PROCEDURE: CPAP therapy needs to be continuous and should not be removed unless the patient cannot tolerate the mask or experiences continued or worsening respiratory failure. Procedures - Revised 9/17/21 Continuous Positive Airway Pressure - 30.032 Continuous Positive Airway Pressure - 30.032 SPECIAL NOTES: A.If unable to maintain oxygen saturation > 90%, administer positive airway pressure via BVM and PEEP valve. B.Contact the receiving hospital as soon as possible that a patient with CPAP is enroute to their hospital so they can be prepared for the patient. C.Reassessment of the patient's status is critical, and documentation should be performed every 5 -10 minutes until patient is stable. D.CPAP mask may be removed temporarily to administer nitroglycerin. E.Suctioning of secretions may be required on some patients. F.Watch for gastric distention and/or nausea. G.The CPAP monometers should be used to determine and adjust CPAP pressures as this will vary depending on the device used and whether nebulization is occurring simultaneously. H.Monitor mean arterial blood pressure c losely in all patients with CPAP.Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 Emergency Cricothyrotomy - 30.035 Emergency Cricothyrotomy - 30.035 INDICATIONS: This technique is to be used only when other attempts to establish an airway have been unsuccessful (i.e., you are unable to intubate or ventilate using BVM) and respiratory obstruction exists.

Procedures - Revised 9/29/22 End-Tidal CO 2 Monitoring - 30.070 End-Tidal CO 2 Monitoring - 30.070 Indications: 1.Capnography shall be used when available with the use of all advanced airway procedures and as required by treatment guidelines. Procedure: 1.Attach capnography sensor to the monitor first to allow for room air calibration, then attach to the adv anced airway or any other oxygen delivery device, including bag- valve mask and nasal cannula. 2.Note that EtCO 2 level and waveform changes. Normal EtCO 2 levels range from 30s and 40s, but this may vary based on the patient's underlying, respiratory, and metabolic status . EtCO 2 levels that rise from a normal baseline to or above 50 may indicate hypoventilation is occurring. 3.Respiratory and metabolic values shall be documented in the ePCR. 4. The capnometer shall remain in place and be monitored throughout prehospital care and transport. 5.Any loss of EtCO 2 detection or waveform may indicate an airway problem and should be immediately addressed and thoroughly documented. 6.Document the procedure and results in the ePCR. Notes: 1.EtCO 2 readings may be unreliable if the patient is in shock or has poor perfusion. 2.Patient stimulation, use of a BVM, or use of Naloxone may be appropriate based on the situation.Procedures - Crea 30.072 DEFINITION: The i -gel\u00ae is a disposable supraglottic airway created as an alternative to endo tracheal intubation or mask ventilation. The i-gel\u00ae is designed for positive pressure ventilation as well as for spontaneously breathing patients.

Procedures - Revised 9/30/20 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD 30.107 BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (L VADs ) are designed to assist the pumping function of the patient's left ventricle. The Heart Ware HVAD\u00ae,Heart Mate II\u00ae, and Heart Mate III\u00ae devices attach to the apex of the left ventricle (pump inflow) and propel blood to the ascending aorta (pump outflow) . These devices utilize an external wearable system that includes a small controller connected to the internal pump by an external driveline and is powered by two batterie s. They may also be \"plugged in\" to 110 or 12 V power, depending on the device. When managing an LVAD patient , follow the se general assessment guidelines. ASSESSING PATIENT WITH LVAD: A.Establish airway and provide supplemental oxygen if any respiratory signs or symptoms are present. B.If a patient with an LVAD is having a medical emergency, it does not necessarily mean that it is a device issue. Consider the whole clinical picture and per form a thorough patient assessment, including device function. Infection, volume depletion, stroke, bleeding , and dysrhythmias may be the cause of patient's symptoms. Most LVAD patients are anticoagulated and are at risk for bleeding complications . C.Auscultate heart sounds to determine if the device is functioning . Both the Heart Ware HVAD\u00ae and Heart Mate II\u00ae, are continuous flow device s and you should hear a \" whirring\" sound\". Because these devices diminish pulsatile flow in the circulation , peripheral pulses may not be palpable. The Heart Mate III\u00ae, although continuous flow, may provide artificial pulsatility (as well as a pulsatile hum) due to the addition of intermittent sp eed reduction which was designed into the device. Since this artificial pulse is not synchronized with the patient's heart rate, it may augment or diminish the native pulse. If a pulse is palpable, a BP can be attempted. Assess other signs of circulation \u2014 capillary refill, absence or presence of dizziness, temp erature / moisture of skin, end-tidal CO 2, and mental status to determine perfusion status. D.Standard blood pressure devices may not work. If unable to obtain a blood pressure consider using the following, if available, to estimate perfusion pressure: 1.End-Tidal CO 2 - Expected values should be between 35 - 45 mmHg. 2.Doppler cuff pressure - Estimates the mean arterial pressure. The goal range for Doppler MAP is > 60 and less than 90. 3.Other clinical signs - Capillary refill, mental status . E.Locate the device to identify which type is in place and follow the device specific troubleshooting guidelines. Intervene appropriately based on the type of alarm and device. F.Start Large Bore IV and treat with fluids as needed . G.Pulse oximetry may not be accurate due to the continuous flow nature of the device. You may not get an accurate reading in the field. H.Your cardiac monitor will work, and a reliable E CG may be obtained. Because the LVAD creates continuous flow independent of left heart function , not all arrhythmias will be symptomatic , including ventricular arrhythmias . If a patient requires defibrillation, leave the pump running and all components in place. The LVAD does not interfere with electrical conduction. In general, LVAD patients also have an AICD/ Pacemaker . Do not place defibrillation pads directly over the pump or AICD/ Pacemaker (consider anterior/posterior placement). I.All ACLS medications may be administered if necessary. J.If susp ected cardiac arrest, proceed to following flow chart:Unresponsive LVAD patient Is the patient breathing AND can you hear a VAD hum? Initiate CPR and follow ACLS prot o cols 2ndResponder available and/or trained family member assess LVAD function: Lo ok/Listen for alarms Check driveline connection to LVAD controller Check power connection to LVAD controllerDoppler MAP > 50mmHg OR E T CO2 > 20mmHg? If any of the following true? Abse n t VAD hum \"Pump Off\" displayed Flow < 1 L/min Pulsatility < 1 Perform controller exchange Follow standard protocols except NO C HE ST COMPRESSIONS because the VAD is likely providing adequate forward flowYES NO Continue CPR and follow ACLS prot o colsYES YES NONO LVAD AND be paged) Refer to the LVAD Protocol for detail instructions on the battery and controller . DO NOT USE MECHANICAL CPR. The 2 most common causes of pump failure are disconnection of the power and failure of the controller . Transport LVAD patient in circulatory arrest to the nearest VAD hospital; otherwise transport the patient to their designated VAD center . Patients on LVAD support frequently do not have a palpable pulse or recognizable BP yet have adequate perfusion. In the non-invasive assessment of the BP , use a manual BP cuff with Doppler when available, with ETCO2 as the second option. Assess and treat the patient during transport!Procedures - Revised 9/30/20 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular 30.107 PATIENT: A.Consider t ransport ing the LVAD patient in circulatory arrest to the nearest VAD hospital; otherwise transport the patient to their designated VAD center . Call the number on the device and follow advice of the LVAD Coordinator on call for troubleshooting the device . B.For all other c oncerns contact OLMC. C.The patient must be supported by battery power. Remember to also transport the backup controller and the spare batteries. D.The controller should be kept close to the patient, and care taken to not kink the leads. E.If removi ng or cuttin g patients clothing, use caution as not to sever the driveline. F.Do not put external pressure on any area of the LVAD system. G.Place gurney straps underneath the leads, and keep the batteries easily accessible. H.Allow the trained caregiver to ride in the transport vehicle if possible to act as a n expert on the device in the absence of consciousness in the patient. I.Bring all of the patient's equipment. NOTES AND PRECAUTIONS : A.LVAD patients who are anticoagulated have a higher risk of bleeding and hemorrhage. B.There are no valves on an LVAD, so there is the risk of retrograde flow and stagnation of blood if the device stops, or flow is impeded. C.These patients are pre -load and afterload dependent, so hypovolemia c an have a profound effect. D.If a patient is hypertensive , flow through the device may be reduced .Procedures - Revised 9/30/20 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD - 30.107 Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD - 30.107 Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD - 30.107 Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD - 30.107 Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD - 30.107 Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD - 30.107 Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD - 30.107 Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD - 30.107 Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD - 30.107 Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 Left Ventricular Assist Devices - 30.107 Left Ventricular Assist Devices LVAD - 30.107 Procedures - Created 7/1/21 Modified Valsalva Maneuver 30.110 Modified Valsalva Maneuver - 30.110 DEFINITION: Traditional vagal maneuvers have a low frequency of successfully converting Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) to sinus rhythm.

C.Gently apply press ure to the lateral aspect of the patella (directing it medially) while extending the leg . NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.Reductions should not be attempted for medial dislocations, as these commonly have associated fractures. B.Patients should be splinted and transported regardless of success of reduction attempt. If a patient does not want transport after successful reduction, OLMC contact is mandatory as part of the refusal process. Extend Leg Gently guide patella in at the same time Patient Restraint - 30.120 Procedures - Revised 3/20/22 Patient Restraint - 30.120 P URPOSE: Escalation control of agitation or aggressive behavior should be attempted prior to physical or chemical restraint. However, if escalation control is not feasible, physical and chemical restraint should be used to protect the safety of patients and responders. Patient restraints should be utilized only when necessary and because the patient is exhibiting behavior that presents a danger to themselves and/or others based on an objective assessment of agitation and risk of violence such as the Broset Violence Assessment. PROCEDURE: Escalation Control Guideline: R espect Personal Space: allowing extra physical space between you and the patient helps the patient not feel crowded or threatened and allows for provider safety. Always try to position near an exit. Do not rush in. Assess the patient's body language, listen to their tone of voice, and make a plan. D o not go in alone: but limit the number of responders in the room or area with the patient so as not to overwhelm them. All communication with the patient should channel through one person. A ppear Calm: use a low, monotonous voice when speaking to the patient. Use good body language: avoid crossed legs/hands, hands in pockets, etc. Try to be at the patient's eye level. List en Without Judgement: acknowledge what the patient is saying. Confirm the legitimacy of their perceived problem, not their behavior. U se Reflective Statements/Responses: for example, if the patient says, \"I can't believe no one in my family has called me or visited\" a reflective response would be, \"sounds like you are frustrated and feeling unsupported by your family.\" T olerate Silences S et Limits: it is ok to set parameters around the patient's behavior so that everyone is safe. G ive the Patient Appropriate Choices: this can help the patient regain a sense of control. For example, \"Would you like to sit up on the gurney or lay down?\" O ffer Optimism However Do Not Make Promises That Cannot Be Kept D o Not Argue with the Patient: stick to the goal of escalation control. Remember they do not know you so do not take insults personally. Physical Restraint Guidelines: A.P erform the Broset Violence Assessment checklist :Patient Restraint 30.120 Procedures - Revised 3/20/22 Patient Restraint - 30.120 G IVE 1 POINT FOR EACH OF THE FOLLOWING BEHAVIORS PRESENT Confusion 1 point Irritability 1 point Boisterousness 1 point Verbal Threats 1 point Physical Threats 1 point Attacks on Objects 1 point Score 0 Low risk of violence Score 1-2 Moderate risk of violence, preventative measures should be taken. Score 3 or higher High risk of violence. Preventative measures are required. B.Use the minimum level of physical restraints required to accomplish patient care and ensure safe transportation (soft restraints may be sufficient). If law enforcement or additional manpower is needed, call for assistance prior to attempting restraint procedures. Do not endanger yourself or your crew. C.Do not place restraints in such a way as to preclude evaluation of the patient's medical status or interfere with management of the airway. Physical Restraint Procedure : A.Place the patient face up on gurney, NOT PRONE. Closely monitor the patient's respiratory status. B.Secure ALL extremities to gurney. Try to restrain lower extremities first using restraints around both ankles. Next, restrain the patient's arms with one arm anchored to the head of the bed and the other arm anchored to the frame of the gur ney. C.S oft restraints are the restraint of choice. Zip ties or flex cuffs should not be used. D.Hand cuffed patients should be transitioned to soft restraints as soon as feasible. E.If it is not feasible to transition a patient out of hand cuffs, law enforcementmust be present in the ambulance with a handcuff key for transport. F.Evaluate the patient's respiratory and cardiac status continually. Monitor SpO 2 if possible. G.DO NOT tighten the gurney's chest straps to the point that they restrict breathing.Patient Restraint - 30.120 Procedures - Revised 3/20/22 Patient Restraint - 30.120 Pharmacological Sedation Guidelines: Sedative agents may be needed to restrain the violently combative patient. These patients may include alcohol and/or substance abuse patients, intoxicated patients, and restless and combative head-injury patients. Pharmacological Sedation Procedure: A.Document and post sedation. B.Evaluate the number/ability of personnel needed to safely restrain the patient. C.Patients who are agitated but cooperative should be oered Olanzapine 10 mg SL D.Patients who are disruptive without danger should be treated with Midazolam 5 mg IM or Olanzapine 10 mg SL. E.Patients who are severely agitated, considered a danger to self or sta, who are physically violent or pose credible threats should be treated with Midazolam 10 mg IM AND H aloperidol 10 mg IM . Be prepared to manage the patient's airway if necessary. F.Multiple medications cannot be given in the same syringe. G.Consider and treat medical and traumatic causes of combativeness -hypoxia, head injury , hy poglycemia, etc. H.If the patient remains a safety threat to self/others 10 minutes after the initial dos e of phar macological sedation, administer Haloperidol 5 mg IM. I.Assess vital signs in first 5 minutes and at least every 10 minutes and before each additional medication if possible. J.M onitor patient's EKG and obtain a 12-lead if possible. Be alert for prolonged QT. If prolonged QT is identified, Haloperidol is contraindicated. Olanzapine may be administer ed in standard doses. N OTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.Pharmacological sedation is a medical procedure that results from a medical assessm ent. C hemical restraint should not be initiated to facilitate law enforcem ent. B.If not m onitored properly, a pharmacologically sedated patient is in a state of pre-cardiac arrest. All patients who receive IV, IO, or IM pharmacological sedation must be fully monitor ed w ith EKG, EtCO2, SpO2 and vital signs to prevent complications C. Side effects of haloperidol may include hypotension, tachycardia, and acute dystonic reactions. D.Haloperidol may induce Torsades de Pointes in patients with history of prolonged QT or patients taking QT-prolonging drugs. Monitor patient's ECG, if possible. If prolonged QT is present (> 500 msec.), contact OLMC. E.Haloperidol is preferred for patients with known psychiatric disorders. Midazolam is preferre d for patients who are known or suspected to be under the influence of stimulants or other intoxicants, who are in withdrawal, or who are postictal.Patient Restraint - 30.120 Procedures - Revised 3/20/22 Patient Restraint - 30.120 Flow Chart PEDIATRIC DOSING: Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO to a max single dose 5 mg or 0.2 mg/kg IM/IN to a max single dose of 10 mg* *Call OLMC for additional midazolam or other Pelvic Immobilization - 30.132 Pelvic Immobilization - 30.132 PURPOSE : The initial reduction of an unstable pelvic fracture (to lessen ongoing internal bleeding and to ease the pain by splinting the fracture) using either a specifically applied sheet or another approved device. INDICATIONS: A.To be applied in all tr auma patients who have appropriate mechanism(s) of injury and who pre sent with pelvic instability. B.Cons ider pelvic wrap in trauma patients who have appropriate mechanism(s) of injury and who are in shock. PELVIC SLING PROCEDURE: A.Remove objects from patie nt's pocket or pelvic a rea. Place SAM \u00ae Pelvic Sling gray side up beneath patient at level of trochanters (hips). B.Place BLACK STRAP through buckle and pull completely through. Procedures - Revised 9/6/16 Pelvic Immobilization - 30.132 Pelvic Immobilization - 30.132 C.Hold ORANGE STRAP and pull BLACK STRAP in oppo site direction until you hear and feel the buckle click. Maintain tension and immediately press BLACK STRAP onto surface of SAM \u00ae Pelvic Sling to secure. PELVIC WRAP PROCEDURE: A.Fold the sheet smoothly lengthwise to about 9 inches wide (do not roll) and apply underneath the pelvis, centered on the greater trochanters. Assure the patient 's pockets are empty (if applicable) to avoid placing pressure on the objects into the patient. B.Tighten the sheet around the pelvis and adjust the tension to try to return the pelvis to normal anatomical position. C.Secure using a knot or clamps if available. NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.Always re -check the position of the sheet (in terms of up and down). You should still be able to feel the anterior superior iliac spines after placement. If not, the sheet may be too high on the pelvis and must be repositioned. B.If the pelvis is unstable on initial exam, do not repeat the exam. C.Blood loss in a pelvic fracture can be significant. Monitor closely and treat per Shock P rotocol. D.Consider placing prior to extrication from a vehicle if feasible. E.The pelvic sling/wrap is contraindicated for suspected isolated hip fractures (i.e. ground level falls ). Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 PICC Line Access - 30.140 PICC Line Access - 30.140 BACKGROUND: A Peripherally Inserted Central Line (PICC) is a common method of maintaining long - term venous access in select patients . PICC lines ar e typically inserted into the antecubital fossa, and then threaded into central circulation. PICC lines ar e flushed with heparin to maintain patency and therefore it is imperative to aspirate 5 ml of blood from the line prior to use. INDICATIONS: A.PICC lines may be accessed when there is a need for drug or fluid administration and traditional means of venous access are unsuccessful. B.Patien t or patient's caregiver re quests use of PICC line. CONTRAINDICATIONS: A.Inability to aspirate or infuse through the catheter . B.Catheter located in any place other than the patient's upper arm. C.Need for rapid fluid resuscitat ion. PROCE DURE : A.Use clean gloves an d maintain sterility as much as possible. B.If there is a needleless type port on the distal end of the catheter, perform the following : (figure 1 ) 1.Scrub the port with an alcohol pad for at least 15 seconds and allow to dry for at least 5 seconds. 2.Attach a 10 ml syringe (without saline) to the port . 3.Unclamp if necessary (needle less port may not have a clamp) . 4.Attempt to aspirate at least 5 ml of blood. Blood should draw freely. If it does not, remove the syringe and DO N OT use the catheter for access. 5.If blood aspirates freely, remove the 10 ml syringe with blood and discard. 6.Attach a 10 ml syringe with NS and gently flush the line. Never use a smaller syringe. If line does not flush, remove the syringe and DO NOT use the catheter for access. 7.If line flushes, r emove the syringe and a ttach the catheter to the end of the IV tubing and begin infusion of NS or LR. Adjust the rate to the needs of the patient within the limits of the catheter. 8.Administer medications thoug h IV tubing port if indicated. C.If the re is a capped needle -type port on the distal end of t he catheter , perform the following: (figure 2 ) 1.Scrub the cap with an alcohol pad for at least 15 seconds and allow to dry for at least 5 seconds. 2.Clamp the cathet er tubing using ONLY the existing clamp on the catheter and then remove the cap. Neve r allow a central line to be open to air. 3.Attach a 10 ml syringe on the catheter end. 4.Unclamp the catheter . 5.Attempt to aspirate a t least 5 ml of blood. Blood should draw freely. If it does not, re-clamp the line and remove the syringe . DO NOT use the catheter for access. 6.If blood aspirates freely, clamp the catheter again. 7.Remove the 10 ml syringe with blood and discard.Procedures - Revised 9/30/2020 PICC Line Access - 30.140 PICC Line Access - 30.140 8.Attach a 10 ml syringe with NS. 9.Unclamp and gently flush the line. Never use a smaller syringe. If line does not flush, re -clamp the line and remove the syringe. DO NOT use the catheter for access. 10.If line flushes, re -clamp and remove the syringe. 11.Attach the catheter to the end of the IV tubing . 12.Unclamp the catheter and begin infusion of NS or LR. Adjust the rate according to the needs of the patient within the limits of the catheter. 13.Administer medications though IV tubing port if indicated . NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.Do not administer medicatio ns, flush , or aspirate with less than a 10-cc syringe. Smaller size syringes generate too much pressure and can damage the catheter. B.Do not attempt to reinject aspirated blood as it may contain clots. C.The maximum flow rates for a PICC line is 125 ml/hr for less than size 2.0 French , and 250 ml/hr for catheters over 2.0 size French. D.Keep patient 's arm straight to avoid kinking the PICC line and obstructing flow. E.Ensure all line connections are secure. F.PICC lines access the patient's central circulatio n and the risk of infection is high. Avoid contamination to ports and connections while accessing. G.Do not administer the following medications through a PICC line: 1.Adenosine - The line may rupture during rapid infusion due to over pressurization. 2.Dextro se 50% - The catheter can be damaged due to the viscosity of the fluid. Figure 1 - Needle less port Figure 2 - Non-needle less type port w ith cap Procedures - New 10 /30/17 Positive End -Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) - 30.145 Positive End -Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) - 30.145 DEFINITION: Positive e nd-expirat ory pressure (PEEP) is a method of ventilation in which airway pressure is maintained above atmospheric pressure at the end of exhalation by means of a mechanical impedance (PEEP valve) . PEEP has some similarity to CPAP al though it is delivered through bag instead of a facemask. It can be delivered via bag -valve - mask or bagging into an endotracheal tube. At the end of exhalation PEEP prevents alveolar collapse (i.e. the alveoli stay open) and improves oxygen exchange acr oss the alveolar membrane. Additionally, PEEP may recruit more alveoli that have collapsed, which may further improve oxygenation. ADDING PEEP IS DONE TO IMPROVE OXYGENATION. The disadvantage to PEEP is that it may increase intrathoracic pressure, whic h may reduce blood flow in cardiac arrest or a shock state. INDICATIONS: Hypoxia , either prior to or post intubation despite ate bag ventilation with 100% oxygen . CONTRAINDICATIONS: A.Cardiac arrest (absolute). B.Hypotension or shock state (relative ). May still choose to apply PEEP when preparing to RSI a hypoxic/hypotensive patient . PROCEDURE: A.If not already applied, apply PEEP valve to bag device. B.Dial PEEP valve to 5cm H2O and bag per usual. C.Increase PEEP by 5cm every 3 -5 minutes until hypoxia resolves (oxygen saturation > 95 %). D.Maximum PEEP is 15 cm H2O. NOTES AND PRECAUTIONS: A.Increasing bagging rate will not necessarily improve oxygenation but can cause hyperventilation, which can be detrimental to patients. B.PEEP valve may come out of the pack age set to five or zero. Be aware of valve settings. C.Maxim um PEEP in pediatrics is 5cm H2O.Procedures - Revised 10/10/16 Sports Equipment Removal - 30.160 Sports Equipment Removal - 30.160 DEFINITION: To provide direction on the safe removal of protective sports equ ipment that includes helmet and shoulder pads. This procedure page uses football gear as an examp le, but these guidelines can be used with other sports equipment as well. PROCED URE: A.Initial Evaluation 1.The initial evaluation should begin by assessing level of consciousness, breathing, and circulation. If the athlete is breathing and stable, but a neck injury is suspected, a quick sensory and motor nerve exam should be initiated. 2.After the quick neurological exam on a stable athlete, the facemask should always be removed. B.Face Mask Removal 1.Stabilize the head. 2.Cut side and top attachments at loop to remove face mask. Some helmets will need a cutting tool to \"release\" the top of the facemask from the helmet. 3.Quick release face masks are also in use and found on newer helmets. One popular device looks like a \"rivet\" instead of a screw. The release mechanism can be activated by p ressing it down with a pen or tip of a screwdriver . Athletic trainers and coaching staff are familiar with this and can provide assistance. Procedures - Revised 10/10/16 Sports Equipment Removal - 30.160 Sports Equipment Removal - 30.160 C.General equipment removal guidelines: 1.If the athlete has neck pain, numbness or tingling, extremity weakness , or is unconscious, the hel met and shoulder pads should not be removed on the field of play. 2.If access to the airway is compromised, removal of the helmet and shoulder pads may be initiated. 3.If removing equipment, always remove the helmet and the shoulder pads, never just one or t he other. Leaving the helmet on or just the shoulder pads on by itself creates head, neck , or spinal cord flexion. D.Removal of helmet and shoulder pads as a unit: 1.Gear removal starts from the head and proceeds down the body. 2.Remove the helmet first and then remove the shoulder pads, and leg gear. Do not start with the shoulder pads. 3.Cut chin straps. 4.Release cheek pad snaps. 5.Use a two-person technique to remove the helmet. a.Person at the top firmly holds manual c -spine at the top using two hands to s tabilize the patient's helmet. b.The other responder, starting at the chin, slides his or her hands inside the patient's helmet \"firmly\" gripping the head and sliding their hands inside the helmet. c.Responders transition manual c -spine responsibility from the person at the top of the head/ helmet to the person supporting the patients head from underneath. d.Firm control of the head and neck is the goal. The person at the top proceeds to remove the helmet off the patient's head in a coordinated and smooth ma nner. DO NOT SPREAD APART SIDES OF HELMET . e.Once helmet is removed, the person at the top of the head resumes manual c -spine until full c -spine precautions are in place. 6.Cut shoulder pad straps . 7.Cut both the jersey and shirt up sleeves towards midline of body . 8.Person at head stabilizes maxilla and occiput and gives commands. 9.Position t hree people on each side, with one stabilizing the head. Another person removes the equipment as a unit. While backboard and straps are being prepared : E.Chest access : 1.Cut je rsey and front laces of shoulder pads . 2.Flip out shoulder pads . Some newer systems allow the shoulder pads to come apart prior to removal. Athletic trainers and coaching staff are familiar with these systems and can provide assistance. 3.Place hands on s hould ers with thumbs grasping the clavicle and fingers surrounding the upper trapezius muscles. 4.Secure the athlete's head between the responder's forearms.Procedures - Revised 10/10/16 Sports Equipment Removal - 30.160 Sports Equipment Removal - 30.160 F.Backbo ard utilization : 1.Log rolling is the preferred method for movement as c rews are most familia r with this technique and understand the importance of moving the patient as a unit and maintaining inline alignment of the head, neck , and spine. 2.The l ift technique is an alternative method that could be used for smaller patients, but it is manpower inten sive. If lifting , remember to l ift as a unit. Slide backboard into place from feet. 3.The p erson at head initiates commands and oversees proper placement and techniques . 4.Position t hree responders on each side of body ; one at shoulders, one at hips, and on e at l egs. 5.One other person is in charge of the backboard and slides it into place . 6.If the helmet is not resting on board, padding can be added to fill space . 7.Fasten straps and tape helmet to board . 8.Chinstrap remains in place unless it interferes with airw ay. 9.Rechec k sensory and motor nerve vitals for changes and document . NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: Athletic Trainers and coaching staff are subject matter experts when it comes to the gear regardless of the sport . Collaborate with them early and often. Procedures - Revised 9/14/14 Suctioning - 30.161 Suctioning - 30.161 INDICATIONS: When patient is exhibiting respiratory difficulty secondary to secretions in airway or the potential for aspiration exists. PROCEDURE: A.Oral Suctioning 1.Pre-oxygenate patient with 100% oxygen. 2.Assemble equipment: Suction unit with tonsil tip o r dental tip, personal protective equipment (gloves, goggles, gown). 3.Attach required monitoring equipment. 4.Turn suction unit on and confirm mechanical suction is present. 5.Insert tip without suction. 6.Cover thumbhole to begin suction if using a tip other tha n dental tip. 7.Apply suction for < 15 seconds. 8.Monitor patient's oxygen saturation. 9.Re-oxygenate patient for at least 2 - 3 minutes between suction ing attempts. B.Tracheal Suctioning 1.Pre-oxygenate patient with 100% oxygen. 2.Assemble equipment: Suction unit, c orrect size suction catheter, sterile rinse, personal protective equipment (gloves, goggles, gown). 3.Attach required monitoring equipment. 4.If patient is being ventilated with BVM through an endotracheal tube prior to suctioning, have someone else remove the bag from end of ET tube prio r to suction attempt. 5.Insert catheter into the ET tube without applying suction. 6.Advance catheter as far as possible. 7.Withdraw slowly using intermittent suction ing while rotating catheter. 8.Do not suction more than 15 seconds. 9.Monitor patient's oxygen saturati on. 10.Rinse catheter in sterile saline. 11.Re-oxygenate patient for at least 2 - 3 minutes between suction attempts. C.Suctioning with Meconium Aspirator Tracheal suctioning is not indicated in the vigorous infant born with meconium stained fluid, whatever the consistency. Simply use a bulb syringe or large bore catheter to clear secretions from the mouth and nose as needed. 1.Assemble equipment: Suction unit, appropriate size ET tube, personal protective equipment (gloves, goggles, gown ). 2.Attach required moni toring equipment. 3.Turn suction unit on and confirm mechanical suction is present. 4.After infant has been intubated, attach meconium aspirator to end of ET tube. 5.Cover thumbhole to begin suctioning while slowly withdrawing the ET tube. Do not suction for mo re than 15 seconds . 6.Monitor patient's oxygen saturation and heart rate and stop if patient becomes bradycardic. 7.Re-oxygenate patient for at least 2 - 3 minutes between suctioning attempts.Procedures - Revised 9/14/14 Suctioning - patient has not been intubated and meconium is thick, at th e least, aggressive oropharyngeal suctioning should be carried out with the largest diameter suction device available. D.Suctioning with Nasal Aspirator equip ment. 2.If nasal secretions are thick consider instilling 1 -4 drops of NS into nares to loosen prior to suctioning. 3.If using electric suction be sure vacuum is set less than 100 mmHg . 4.Gently place device tip into nostril. Avoid placing against inside walls of nostril . 5.Apply suction (< 15 seconds if using electric suction) 6.Repeat as needed NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.Oral and tracheal suctioning can cause trauma to the oropharynx and airway, bradycardia, or hypoxia. It should not delay other resuscitation. B.Suction pressure should be set as low as possible and yet effectively clear secretions. Negative pressure of less than 80 -100 mmHg in neonates and less than 150 mmHg in adults are recommended. C.When suctioning the intubated patient, the d iameter of the su ction catheter should not exceed one half of the internal diameter of the endotracheal tube.Procedures - Revised 10/22/20 Taser\u00ae Barb Barb Removal - 30.162 INDICATIONS: Taser\u00ae barbs should be removed at the request of law enforcement if: A.The patient has been adequately subdued so as not to pose a danger to Fire/EMS personnel. AND, B.The barbs are not embedded in the face, neck , or groin areas. PROCEDURE: A.Perform patient assessment. B.Monitor vital signs and LOC. Ensure that vital signs are in the normal limits for the situation. C.Expose the area where Taser \u00ae barb has implanted under the skin. D.Cut wires from the barb if still attached. E.Place thumb and forefinge r above and below the barb parallel to the portion of the shaft implanted in the patient's skin. F.Spread your thumb and forefinger apart to stretch the skin tightly over the barb. G.Holding tension, use needle -nose pliers (or similar tool) with gripping stren gth and grasp the end of the barb protruding out of the skin near the wire lead and firmly pull out the barb with one quick jerking motion. H.Assess the skin where the barb was removed. The skin should be cauterized from the electrical current. Dress the wou nd to prevent infection. I.Contact OLMC if unsure whether to transport. NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.Patients should be in police custody and monitored by police for the safety of medical personnel. B.Do not remove Taser\u00ae Barbs from the face, neck , or groin area. St abilize the barbs and transport to the Emergency Department. C.Tasers\u00ae emit two barbs. Make sure both are removed. Treat all barbs as a biohazard and dispose as you would any other sharps. D.Potential trauma may have occurred before (during a struggle) or afte r the patient was hit by the Taser\u00ae ( e.g. patient falls and hits head). E.Consider whether the patient meets criteria for Altered Mental Status or Poisonings and Overdoses protocols. F.CAUTION: Where barbs have wires still connected to the Taser\u00ae Gun, shock can still be delivered.Procedures - Revised 9/8/16 decompression a tension pneumothorax using an over -the-needle catheter. INDICATIONS: To warrant chest decompression in the field, the patient must be significantly symptomatic or in extremis (at risk of death) with: A.High c linical suspicion and; B.Progressive respiratory distress and; C.Shock symptoms with low or rapidly decreasing blood pressure. and at least one of the following: A.Decreased or absent breath sounds . B.Consistent history (i.e., chest trauma, COPD, asthma). C.Disten ded neck veins. D.Tracheal shift away from affected side (late sign). E.Asymmetrical movement on inspiration. F.Hyper -expanded chest on affected side. G.Drum -like percussion on affected side. H.Increased resistance to positive pressure ventilation, especially if int ubated. EMS witnessed traumatic arrest patients with abdominal or chest trauma for whom resuscitation is indicated should have bilateral chest decompression performed even in the absence of the above signs. PROCEDURE: A.Expose the entire chest. B.Establish landmarks: 1.Anterior clavicular or . 2.Lateral - 4th intercostal space anterior axillary (above nipple ). C.Clean chest vigorously with appropriate antiseptic. D.On affected side, locate the landmark and insert a large gauge ov er-the-needle catheter with syringe attached along the superior margin of the rib below (e.g. top of third rib to enter second intercostal space) . E.If the air is under tension, the barrel will pull easily and \"pop\" out of the syringe. F.Remove syringe, adva nce catheter, and remove needle. G.Secure from movement. Procedures - Revised 9/8/16 Tension Pneumothorax Decompression PRECAUTIONS: A.Patient's chest should be auscultated often for return of tension or other respiratory complications. B.Tension pneumothorax is a rare condition, but can occur with trauma, spontaneously, or as a complication of intubation. Tension takes time to develop, but forceful positive ventilation may increase the rate of development. C.Simple or non -tension pneumothorax is not life threatening and should not be decompressed in the field. D.The ideal decompression catheter length is three inches. E.Possible complications: 1.Creation of pneumothorax if none existed previously. 2.Laceration of lung or pericardium. Stop needle advancement once it has popped through the pleura and advanc e the catheter only. 3.Laceration of blood vessels . (Always slide the needle above the rib). 4.Infection. Clean rapidly but vigorously; use sterile gloves if possible. F.Tension pneumothorax can be precipitated by the occlusion of an open chest wound. If the patient deteriorates after dressing an open chest wound, remove the dressing.Procedures - Revised 10/9/14 - 30.175 DEFINITION: Placement of a circumferential band around a limb to occlude arterial blood flow distal to the band. INDICATIONS: Extremity hemorrhage that is uncontrollable by less aggressive means (direct pressure, bandaging, or pressure dressing) OR a wound that could cause life threatening extremity hemorrhage during an ongoing tactical problem (e.g. potential building collapse, mass casualty event, amputation). PROCEDURE: A.Fully expose and evaluate the wound. B.Apply tourniquet directly to the skin, 2 - 3 inches proximal to the most proximal limb wound, not over a joint. C.Tighten until all bleeding stops and no distal pulse is palpable. D.Secure the windlass per manufacturer instructions. E.If one properly placed t ourniquet does not control bleeding, a second should be placed proximal to the first and tightened appropriately. F.Endeavor to keep all tourniquets exposed. G.Mark with time of application and communicate this to receiving providers. H.Re-evaluate tourniquets frequently to ensure they have not l oosened. NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.If an improvised tourniquet is present before medical provider arrival, place a commercial tourniquet per protocol and remove the improvised tourniquet if operationally feasible . B.Properly applied tourniquets will rarely dam age tissue if removed within two hours. C.If unable to fully expose a limb and identify all wounds on that limb place the tourniquet as high on the limb as possible. Once all wounds on that limb can be identified, every effort should be made to move the tou rniquet to 2 - 3 inches proximal to the most proximal wounds, and not on a joint. D.Intermittently loosening and tightening a tourniquet to \"reperfuse\" a limb is of no benefit and dangerous as it encourages additional bleeding. E.A single commercially avail able tourniquet completely occludes femoral artery blood flow about 70% of the time. Two tourniquets placed side by side completely occlude about 80% of the time. F.The ability of the tourniquet to completely occlude arterial flow is dependent on limb circu mference. Larger limbs are more difficult to occlude. G.A persistent pulse , continued venous congestion / distention, re -bleeding after initial hemorrhage control, and expanding hematoma are all indications of an ineffective tourniquet. H.Clothing, padding u nder the tourniquet, and limb movement all cause tourniquets to loosen over time and should be avoided. I.Tourniquets can cause significant pain and may require narcotics for pain control . J.Proper placement of a CAT \u00ae tourniquet on a lower extremity requires t hreading the circumferential band through both slits of the buckle. K.Proper placement of the SOFTT t ourniquet requires tightening the knurled screw on the buckle before tightening the windlass.Procedures - Revised 10/23/18 Transcutaneous Pacing - 30.180 Transcutaneous Pacing - 30.180 DEFINITION: Transcutaneous pacing is the technique of electronic cardiac pacing accomplished by using skin electrodes to pass repetitive electrical impulses through the thorax. INDICATIONS: Transcutaneous pacing should be considered in bradycardia with e vidence of inadequate perfusion, (e.g. altered mental status, chest pain, hypotension, other signs of shock). PROCEDURE: A.Ensure ECG pads are attached, and monitor displays a rhythm. B.Attach pacing electrodes to anterior and posterior chest just to the left of the sternum and spinal colum n, respectively. Alternatively, pads may be placed in the standard anterior and lateral position as with defibrillation. If there is difficulty in obtaining capture, try alternative position. C.Begin pacing at a heart rate of 80 beats per minute and 30mA current output. D.Increase current by increments of 10mAs while observing monitor for evidence of electrical capture. Confirm mechanical capture by checking pulses and BP. E.If patient is comfortable at this point, continue pa cing. If patient is uncomfortable, administer midazolam 2.5 - 5 mg slow IV /IO push or if no IV, 5 mg IM /IN. F.If patient still complai ns of pain, repeat dose of midazolam once and contact OLMC. G.If the patient remains unconscious during pacing, assess capt ure by observing the monitor and evaluating pulse and blood pressure changes. In the event of electrical capture and no pulses, follow PEA protocol. H.If there is no response to pacing and drugs, consult with OLMC. If a change in pacing rate is desired, co ntact OLMC. PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: Use above guidelines except: A.Give midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV /IO to a max of 5 mg. (May repeat once after 5 minutes.) If more needed, call OLMC. B.Use anterior/posterior pad placement first for patients less than 1 year. C.Begin pac ing at smallest mA output. D.Increase current in increments of 10 mA while observing monitor for evidence of electrical capture. E.Confirm mechanical capture by checking pulses and BP. F.Contact OLMC for adjustments to rate based on age and response to pa cing. NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: Transcutaneous pacing should not be used in the following settings: A.Asystole . B.Patients meeting Death In The Field criteria. C.Patients in traumatic cardiac arrest.Procedures - XSTAT is a first -in-kind dressing approved for internal use. A syringe -like applicator applies compressed mini -sponges deep into a wound. Upon contact with blood, the sponges expand to 10 -12 times their compressed volume within approximately 20 seconds compressing the wound to stop bleeding. INDICATIONS: XSTAT is for the control of severe, life -threatening bleeding from junctional wounds in the groin or axilla that are not amenable to tourniquet applications in adults and adol escents. It should only be used for patients at high risk for immediate life -threatening bleeding from hemodynamically significant, non -compressible junctional wounds . above the clavicle Contraindicated areas : remove the applicator . B.Insert applicator into wound track as close to bleeding source as possible. C.Insert plunger into applicator, push plunger firmly to deploy sponges. D.If resistance met, pull back slightly on applicator to create additional packing space then continue to depress. E.Use additional applicators as needed to completely pack wound. F.Cover wound with a proper dressing. G.If bleeding persists, apply manual direct pr essure until bleeding is stopped. NOTES & PRECAUTIONS: A.Tourniquets are still the first line treatment for extremity wounds distal to a junction . B.A radiopaque marker is embedded into each of the mini -sponges to make them detectable by X -Ray. C.Never attem pt to remove the mini -sponges from the wound. They must be removed by a surgeon after achieving proximal and distal vascular control. D.The manufacturer includes a Casualty Card inside the XSTAT package . 1.Instructions to the surgeon for removing the sponges from the wound are included on the back of the card. 2.Record the use of XSTAT on the card and forward these instructions to the medical treatment facility. E.Segments of the applicator tip may break away during application and be left in the wound. 1.After inje cting the mini -sponges, check the applicator tip for missing segments 2.Do not attempt to retrieve missing segments from the wound 3.Record the number of lost segments on the Casualty Card.Regional EMS Patient Treatment Protocols - 2023 Section 50.000 Operations Oper ations - Updated 7/16/2020 -19 Response - 50.017 PURPOSE: This advisory is an overlay to existing patient care protocols and applies to the management of patients diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID -19 or an influenza like illness (ILI) based on dispatch information, patient location /context (c are facility, etc.), ongoing outbreak epidemiology, and provider obtained history, judgment and other information.

Ideally doffing should be done with a buddy to wa tch and ensure no personal contamination. 9.PIC should ensure or designate the role to an on -scene provider, that personnel are maintain ing proper PPE and distancing themselves as much as possible from patient. If possible, personnel should stay o ut of the same room as the patient, if not actively providing hands -on care. 10.If possible , at a mi nimum, for patients with cough, shortness of breath, or fever , a simple sur gical/medical mask should be given to the patient to wear over their m outh and nose .Oper ations - Updated 7/16/2020 -19 Response - 50.017 11.If agencies have the capability to utilize remote technology (video - either onsite or remote context e.g. FaceTime, Skype, etc.) to initially sc reen and assess a patient, this can be considered . 12.When possible and safe, limit th e num ber of perso nnel exposed to any known or potentially COVID -19 infected p erson. If safe for patient care, one provider should initially assess a patie nt. 13.When entering a care facility , includ ing adult foste r care homes, with known COVID -19 patients, co nsider the fac ility to be a high-risk area for both providers and patients and personnel exposure should be limited as feasible . Appropriate PPE should be worn inside the facility. EMS personnel are encouraged to ask facility staff to bring patients (weari ng a s imple ma sk) to a central area near the facility entrance for initial EMS evaluation. B.PPE 1.For patient encounters with known or suspected COVID -19 infection, minimum PPE will include gloves, eye prot ection, and mask (N95 or greater if available). Consider gown or coveralls if in physical contact with patient . 2.If high -risk aero solizing procedures are being performed, airborne - precautions and PPE must be used. This means, the above PPE with the addition of gowns and N95 or higher respiratory protec tion. C.Patient Transport Instructions 1.Contact the receiving facility as soon as possib le and advise them that you have a patient needing isolation, if available. Do not enter the ED or other patien t care area until directed by the ED staff . This m ay inclu de alternate locations within the facility such as temporary shelters and treatment areas . 2.Family members and contacts of patients with possible COVID -19 shall not ride in the tr anspor t vehicle except for pediatric patients or other vulnerable o r specia l needs pat ients. 3.Isolate the driver from the patient compartment if possible; i f unable, the driver should wear appropriate mask and eye protection. 4.During transport, vehicle ventilation se ttings in both compartments should be on non-recirc ulated m ode. Open the outside air vents in the driver are a and turn on the ve ntilation fans to the highest setting. 5. If possible, place patient in yello w emerg ency blanket car diac arrest patients are high-risk and high-risk PPE should be worn . 2.See a irway management B.Respiratory Distress 1.Airborne precautio ns (high -risk PPE) are needed for any aerosol generating procedures as defined previously . 2.If using a nasal cannula or NRB , a simple mask should be applie d over for this equipment o n a patient's face if possible . 3.All personnel in the room with a patient receiving any high -risk procedure s should use appropriate high -level PPE befo re treatment is initiated. 4.Nebulized meds should be used as a last res ort - consider other appropriat e treatments first. A patient with severe respiratory di stress and wheezing can still recei ve nebulized treatments. Perform treatments on sc ene and o utside if possible. Nebulizer treatments should not be performed during transport . 5.Instead of nebulized tre atments for asthma, consider epinephr ine (0.3mg - 0.5 mg Epi 1:1000 IM every 5 minutes, repeated once). Consider using lower dos es (0.1 - 0.3 mg IM) for patients > 40 years old or with known coronary artery disease. 6.If available, use an albuterol Metered Dose Inhaler (M DI) in lieu of nebulizer treatments. If patient has their own MDI , consider bringing it with you for use in route. 4 puffs of an albut erol MDI is equivalent to 1 nebul ized treatment ; if available , use a space r. 7.When treating for suspected SCAPE, IV NTG bolus may be preferred over CPAP /BiPaP to de crease exposur e risk to providers from COVID -19 possible patients . 8.BVMs should be equipped with Viral/HEPA filters, as available . 9.Maximize area ventilation during these procedu res as abl e: op en doors, use exhaust fans, etc. 10.In patients f ailing to adequately respon d to su pplemental oxygen (e.g. NC, NRB), consider repositioning patient to impr ove oxygen sat uration. C.General Ai rway Management 1.The m ost ex perienced p rovider should assume control of airway management in known or suspected COVI D-19 patients. 2.The use of SGA s is considered a continuously aerosolizing procedure. 3.When using a BVM , a vira l/HEPA fi lter must be placed between the mask and the bag, if available . D.Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (CPAP/BiPaP ) 1.This is an aerosolizing procedure and should be considered when p erforming advanced airway m anagement and donnin g appropr iate P PE. Attempt to minimize the performance of this procedure to only when necessary for respiratory distress. 2.DO N OT discontinue CPAP /BiPaP upon entering the Response - 50.017 E.Advanced Airway Management 1.If advanced airway manage ment is needed in a possible COVID -19 patient, the most experienced pr ovider on-scene is encourage d to be the person in charge of the airway. 2.Preferred pre -oxygenation method , for perfusing patients , is a BVM with proper facemask -seal with v iral/HEPA filter. Consider DSI as the preferred method of intubation if unable to achieve proper preoxygenation levels . If no issue with preoxygenatio n, RSI can be u sed. 3.In perfusing patients , do not squeeze BVM bag before intubation attempt but hold fac emask with good two -handed technique with PEEP set at 5-10 cmH 2O until initiating advanced airway itment of alveoli . 4.In perf using patients with no , or inadequate respiratory effort, bag patient at a standard ra te. 5.For patients in cardiac arrest, bag patient per standard cardiac arrest protoc ol. 6.Ensure viral/HEPA filter is at tached to BVM ngoscopy (VL) and bougie i s stron gly preferred over direct laryngoscopy (DL). This is to maximize the distance from patient and limit exposure. 8.Endo tracheal intubation is prefe rred over SGA . 9.If a patient responds t o supplemental oxygen with SpO 2 levels above 90% ( and can maintain a dequate airway) defer advanced airway management and notify the hospital of a potential need for air way managemen t upon ar rival. 10.After intubation, make sure that you have the viral/ HEPA fi lter in place on the BVM, as able, to att ach to the tube. Inflate the cuff before bagging the patient . 11.Confirm tube placement u sing standard verification method s, including EtCO 2 waveform capnography. F.Suctioning Suctioning is a high-risk aerosolizing procedure . Operations - Revised 7/08 Crime Scene Response - 50.020 Crime Scene Response - 50.020 PURPOSE: Law enforcement agencies stress that their first priority on any crime scene is the preservation of life with reconstruction of the crime scene second. EMS personnel can be of assistance by adhering to the following guidelines regarding crime sc ene response. PROCEDURE: A.Response and Arrival 1.Be conscious of physical and weather conditions around the site. Tire tracks of suspect vehicles are often located in or adjacent to a driveway. 2.Limit the number of personnel allowed onto the scene. Co nsult with police on the scene to direct placement of vehicles and route of personnel onto the scene. B.Access and Treatment 1.Select a single route to the victim. Maintaining a single route decreases the chance of altering or destroying evidence or track ing blood over a suspect's footprints. 2.Note the location of furniture, weapons, and other articles, and avoid disturbing them. If they need to be moved, someone should note the location the article was moved from, by whom it was moved, and where it was placed. 3.Remove from the scene all EMS generated debris that is contaminated with blood or body fluid and dispose of through established channels. 4.Be conscious of any statements made by the victim or other persons at the crime scene. Write down what these statements were and report to the investigating officers. 5.Note the specific garments worn by the patient at the time of treatment. It is also important not to tear the clothing off or cut through any holes, whether made by a knife, bullet, or ot her object. 6.The victim should be placed on a clean sheet when ready for transport. At the hospital, please try to obtain the sheet once the victim is moved off it. Fold it carefully in on itself and give it to the investigating officers. This is especially important in close contact crimes such as rape, serious assault , and death cases. C.Documentation 1.A detailed report is important in case you are later called to testify in court. An incident report should be completed and should cover your observa tions, conversations with family or witnesses, location of response vehicles and equipment, furniture, weapons, clothing that has been moved, items that were handled , and your route to the victim. 2.An Unusual /Supplemental Event Report may be helpful for you to complete. This is a protected document and if you are called to court may be used by you to refresh your memory of aspects of the call that are not included in the Patient Care Report. 3.Do not offer your opinions or evaluations about the crime scene. REMINDER: Any location can be, or become, a crime scene. When responding, and upon arrival, if something does not appear to be right, notify police. If you suspect a crime scene and police are not present, secure area and document what you see. Operations - Revised 10/27/21 Death and Dying - 50.025 Death and Dying - 50.02 5 A.DEATH IN THE FIELD Purpose : To define und er what conditions treatment can be withheld or stopped . Resuscitation efforts may be withheld if: 1.The patient has a \"DNR \" order. 2.The patient is pulseless and apneic in a mass casualty incident or multiple patien t scene where the resources of the system are required for the stabilization of living patients. 3.The patient is decapitated. 4.The patient has rigor mortis in a warm environment. 5.The patient is in the stages of decomposition. 6.The patient has skin discolorati on in dependent body parts (dependent lividity). Medical Cardiac Arrest : 1.If the initial ECG shows asystole or agonal rhythm confirmed in 3 leads , and the patient, in the responder's best judgment would not benefit from resuscitation: a.The PIC may determine death in the field ; OR b.Begin BLS procedures, and contact OLMC with available patient history, current condition, and with a request for advice regarding discontinuing resuscitation. 2.If after the airway is established and the asystole protocol has been exhausted t he patient persists in asystole (confirm ed in 3 leads) the PIC may determine the patient to be dead in the field. 3.Death in the field may be determined with E tCO 2 of 10 or less in patients with PEA after 30 minutes of ACLS resuscitation. Fo r patients with E tCO 2 greater than 10 either continue resuscitation or contact OLMC to stop resuscitation. 4.Patients in VF should be treated and transported. Traumatic Cardiac Arrest : 1.Traumatic arrest carries high rates of mortality, but improved outcome s have been seen in EMS witnessed arrest. Causes of arrest that may be amenable to prehospital resuscitation include severe hypovolemia, hypoxia, and tension pneumothorax. 2.A cardiac monitor may be beneficial in determining death in the field. 3.Trauma patie nts who have arrested prior to EMS arrival can by declared dead in the field. 4.Witnessed traumatic arrest patients and patients who deteriorate to PEA or asystole may benefit from \"HAT\" resuscitation. Follow the Traumatic Cardiac Arrest Protocol (10 -050). Notes & Precautions : 1.ORS allows a layperson, EMT or paramedic to determine \"Death in the Field\" . 2.Consult OLMC with any doubt about the resuscitation potential of the patient. 3.A person who was pulseless or apneic and has received CPR and has been resuscita ted is not precluded from later being a candidate for solid organ donation.Operations - Revised 10/27/21 Death and Dying - 50.025 Death and Dying - 50.02 5 B.POLST ORDERS AND DECISION MAKING 1.In the pulseless and apneic patient who does not meet DEATH IN THE FIELD criteria but is suspected to be a candidate for withholding resuscit ation, begin CPR and contact OLMC. 2.A patient with decision -making capacity or the legally authorized representative has the right to direct his or her own medical care and can change or rescind previous directives. 3.EMS providers may honor a Do Not Resuscit ate (DNR) order signed by a physician , nurse practitioner or physician assistant . DNR orders apply only to the patient in cardiopulmonary arrest and do not indicate the types of treatment that a person not in arrest should receive. POLST was developed to convey orders in other circumstances. 4.Portable Orders for Life -Sustaining Treatment (POLST): The POLST was developed to document and communicate patient treatment preferences across treatment settings. While these forms are most often used to limit care, they may also indicate that the patient wants everything medically appropriate done. Read the form carefully! When signed by an allopathic physician (MD or DO), naturopathic physician , nurse practitioner, or physician assistant, POLST is a medical order and EMS providers are directed to honor it in their Scope of Practice unless they have reason to doubt the validity of the orde rs or the patient with decision -making capacity requests change. If there are questions regarding the validity or enforceability of the health care instruction, begin BLS treatment and contact OLMC [OAR 847-035-030 (7)] If the POLST is not immediately available, a POLST form as documented in the Electronic POLST registry hosted at MRH (503 -494-7333) may also be honored. Section A: Applies only when patient is in cardiopulmonary arrest Section B : Applies in all other circumstances For a POLST form to be valid it must include : i.Patient's name ii.Date signed (forms do not expire) iii.Health care professional's signature (patient signature is optional) 5.The legally authorized representative may make decisions for the patient who is unable to make medical decisions. However, when in doubt or for unresolved conflict on the scene contact OLMC. The order is: a.A legal guardian b.A power of attorney for health care as designated by the patient on the Oregon advance directive c.Spouse or legal domestic partner d.Adult children e.Parent 6.Death with Dignity : If a person who is terminally ill and appears to have ingested medication under the provisions of the O regon Death with Dignity Act, the EMS provider should: a.Provide comfort care as indicated.Operations - Revised 10/27/21 Death and Dying - 50.025 Death and Dying - 50.02 5 b.Determine who called 9 -1-1 and why (i.e. to control symptoms or because the person no longer wishes to en d their life with medications). c.Establish the presence of DN AR orders and/or documentation that this was an action under the provisions of the Death with Dignity Act. d.Contact OLMC. e.Withhold resuscitation if: DNAR orders are present, and there is evidence that this is within the provisions of the Death with Dignity Act and OLMC agrees. C.PATIENTS ENROLLED IN HOSPICE AND DYING PATIENTS 1.Look for POLST forms (contact Registry if needed) and atte mpt to honor patient preferences. Always provide comfort measures. 2.If patient is enrolled in hospice and the patient has not a lready done so, contact hospice if possible. 3.EMS providers cannot take medical orders from a hospice nurse, but their advice is often invaluable and may be followed with direction from OLMC. 4.Treat dying persons with warmth and understanding. Do not avoid them. Allow them to discuss their situation, but do not push them to talk. 5.Many dying people are not upset by discussions of death as long as you do not take away all of their hope. 6.Touching a dying person is important. Use words like \"death\". Do not us e meaningless synonyms. 7.Ask the person how you might help. 8.Give factual information. 9.Be aware of your own fears regarding death and admit when a dying person reminds you of a loved one. If a particular person is too disturbing, have your partner or other members of the responding team take over. 10.Consider providing pain/symptom management and not transporting patient if they are Comfort Measures Only, the symptoms can be managed, and the patient and caregivers on scene do not want transport to the hospita l. Consider OLMC contact for advice. D.CARE OF GRIEVING PERSONS Resuscitation phase: 1.As time allows , give accurate and truthful updates about the patient's prognosis. If available, assign one person to interact with and support family members . 2.Consider gently removing children from the resuscitation area. 3.Depending upon the emotional state of family members, consider allowing them to watch and/or participate in a limited and appropriate way. 4.If family or friends were doing CPR prior to your arrival, commend their efforts. 5.If family or friends are disruptive consider removing them or try assigning simple tasks, such as helping bring in the stretcher, holding doors open, telling other family about the event and calling the doctor or clergy member . 6.Be respectful. Make requests. Don't give orders.Operations - Revised 10/27/21 Death and Dying - 50.025 Death and Dying - 50.02 5 Once death is determined: 1.Treat the recently dead with respect. 2.Tell family and friends of the death honestly. Use the words \"death\" or \"dead\". Avoid using euphemisms such as \"passed away\" or \"gone\". 3.Avoid using past tense terms when speaking to survivors of the recently dead. 4.Allow family and friends to express their emotions. Listen to them if they want to talk but don't push them. 5.Give factual information. 6.Genuine warmth and compassion will be more h elpful than almost anything else for survivors. Don't feel it necessary to say the \"right\" things. Listening often provides grieving people with the most comfort. Focusing on survivors: 1.See to it that survivors have a support system present before you le ave. Consider calling TIP through EMS Dispatch, if available in your jurisdiction. Call friends, family, clergy, or neighbors to be with them. Respect the survivor's wishes to be alone. 2.Explain the next steps to them after you have pronounced death. This will include the police coming to make reports, possibly the medical examiner, and the possible need fo r an autopsy . 3.Contact the Medical Examiner's office as soon as possible before moving or altering the body . 4.Allow family and friends to say their good -byes if possible. 5.A chaplain may be helpful in assisting with survivors. It is advisable to call early, as the chaplains do not have code -3 capabilities. 6.Help survivors make decisions such as which people should be called. If they ask you to make c alls, try to comply, mention the need to find a funeral home, if one has not already been chosen. Clergy may also be helpful with this decision. E.DEATH OF A CHILD: 1.Do not accuse the parents of abuse or neglect but take careful note of the patient 's surroundings and the general physical condition of the child. 2.Do not be overly silent, which may imply guilt to the parents. 3.Ask the parents only necessary questions and do not judge or evaluate them. Do not tell them what they \"should have\" been doing befo re your arrival. 4.Remind parents to arrange for childcare of other children. 5.Listen carefully to their statements and answer only with accurate information. 6.If there is a police investigation, tell the parents that this is routine. 7.Successful managem ent of child deaths requires supportive, compassionate , and tactful measures.Operations - Created 6/17/20 Death Notifications - 50.030 Death Notifications - 50.030 PURPOSE : To establish guidelines for the handling of the body and required notification following a declaration of death as outlined in ORS Chapter 146. The goal of an investigation by the medical examiner's office is to determine the cause and manner of death. PROCEDURE: A.If the patient appears to meet obvious death in the field criteria, have only one person enter the scene to verify death ; limit access if possible . Don't move the decedent unless necessary. Document anything that was altered by your examination (e.g. unbuttoned/removed clothing, movement of the decedent, etc.). B.Contact police for all deaths in the field except for hospice and skilled nursing facilities. C.Upon declaration of death , the medical examiner (ME) must be cont acted. Until contact is made with the ME: 1.Do not move the body . 2.Do not cover the body unless necessary (outside, public place ). If covering the body is necessary, use a new/clean non -cloth disposable sheet or blanket such as an emergency blanket . 3.Do not remove clothing or cleanse the body or otherwise alter the appearance of the state of the body . 4. Do not remove any of the effects of the deceased or instruments or weapons related to the death . 5. Do not let anyone in the area w here the deceased is located . 6.If resuscitation was attempted, d o not remove IV's, advanced airways, or defib/ECG pads . Circle all IV attempts or any trauma or marks that you cause d to the body with a n ink pen if possible . D.Depe nding on the circumstanc es, the ME will either respond to the scene for a full investigation or release the body to a funeral home with a limited investigation. Generally, it is best to turn the scene over to law enforcement once you have given a report. E. You should not leav e the scene without passing the scene off to law enforcement or until the ME has released you over the phone or the ME arrives at the scene and has released you. F.The following documentation is required for declaration of death calls: 1. Location and position the body was found . 2. Location o f evidence if moved for safety concerns (gun, knife, bat, etc.) . 3. Anything suspici ous (e.g. bruises on the body, deformed arm, black eye, comments made by bystanders/relatives/friends, etc.). 4. Name and titl e of individual the scene is turned over to (law enforcement, ME, another crew ) and the disposition of the body . 5.The name of the ME if the body is released with a limited investigation . 6. Follow your individual agency's medical records policy for lis ting witnesses or possible witnesses with contact in formation.Operations - Created 6/17/20 Death Notifications - 50.030 Death Notifications - 50.030 NOTES : A. Once the person is declared dead, your jurisdiction ends. Even law enforcement is not allowed to touch or move the body. On ly the ME, Deputy ME (also referred to as a Med icolegal Death Investigator) , or District Attorney , has lawful a uthority over the body. Any of these individuals can grant access or removal of the body. B. Not all deaths are under the jurisdiction of the ME (e.g. patient on hospice care longer than 24 hours , patient who dies in a skilled nursing facility ). However, EMS calls should be considered a n ME case and reported to the ME. It is best to l et the ME decide if this is their case or not. C. Your chart may be read by the ME's office and if read, will become part of the report for cause and manner of death. D. In smaller counties and jurisdictions, law enforcement officers may be appointed as Deputy ME 's or medic olegal Death Investigators, who under the direction of the ME 's office, can investiga te deaths and authorize the removal of a body of a deceased person from the apparent place of death. E. If you suspect a COVID -19 death, document the names and contact information of everyone who had contact with the person that is on scene. F. The follo wing information should be available , if possible, prior to contacting the ME . The ME may not ask for all this information but be ready with this information. Your name Any evidence of drug use Unit number Name of deceased What you were dispatched on Address of deceased How you found the patient Age of deceased Brief description of your actions Gender of deceased Whether you suspect foul play Medical history Whether death occurred at work Medications Whether death occurred while in custodyPrimary caregiver and phone number Whether death was the result of a crimeFamily contact Whether death was unattended Funeral home Whether cause o f death might be from a contagious diseaseOperations - Revised 10/12/2021 Documentation - 50.040 Documentation - 50.040 PROCEDURE: A.A patient care report shall be generated for each identified patient and shall be completed on an approved State EMS patient care form. B.Documentation shall include, at least: 1.The patient's presenting problem. 2.Vital signs with times. 3.History and physical findings as directed by individual protocols. 4.Treatment(s) provided, and time(s). 5.If monitored, ECG strip , 12-lead ECG, and interpretation. 6.Any change in the condition of the patient. 7.OLMC contact: a.Include physician name b.Time of contact c.Orde rs received fr om physician C.An electronic Prehospital Care Report must be submitted to a hospital or facility receiving the patient with 24 hours of the patient being transported per ORS 333 - 250-0310. D.If a patient refuses treatment and/or transport, refer to Refusal an d Informed Consent protocol .PURPOSE: To allow paramedics to provide immunizations and infectious disease testing for both seasonal outbreaks and during public health emergencies. Community immunization and other public health applications are important duties that paramedics and EMTs may perform as determined necessary in cooperation with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and the local public health department. Training will be approved by the EMS Medical Director and OHA and may be accomplished under the direction of the OHA and/ or local public health department. PROCEDURE: 1.Indications for immunization and/or infectious disease testing: a.The public or EMS agency personnel may be immunized or tested under guidelines developed by OHA or the local public health department . b.Age groups for immunization will be determined by the OHA or public healt h de partment as appropriate for the immunization clinic setting or infectious diseas e te sting requirements as determ ined necessary by the local public health department or agency infection control guidance. c.Timing of immunizations or infectious disease testing will be determined by OHA, EMS agency and public health department to comply with public health needs or agency immunization requirements as determined by agency infection control guidance. d.Immunizations or testing may be performed in clinic, mass immunization or agency setting as approved by OHA and/ or local public health department. 2.Immunization or infectious disease testing: a.Immunizations or testing may be administered via IM, SQ or intranasal route in dos ing determined by guidance provided by the MCA or local public healt h de partment as required for the agent administered. b.Other testing methods/procedures will follow guidance and training provided by OHA or the local health department. c.Screening will be performed as determined appropriate for the agent administered by OHA or local health department. 3.Training: Training for immunization or infectious disease testing will be provided by local public health department personnel or under an approved OHA program. 4.Personnel requirements: Immunizations or infectious disease testing may only be perform ed by p aramedics or EMTs trained by local public health department personnel or under approved OHA training programs. 5.Record keeping: A record of public or agency personnel receiving immunizations or infectious disease testing will be maintained by the agency performing the immunizations or testing as determined by the local public health department or OHA .

Patient hand -off reports between either EMS personnel on scene or between EMS pe rsonnel and hospital staff during transfer of care, needs to be delivered in a con sistent an d clear form at to ensure accuracy a nd completeness of information. As many agencies are transitioning to paperless in -field reporting, the passage of detail ed information from one agency to anothe r or to the hospital bec omes critically important . PROCEDURE: The following \"DMIST\" format is a guideline for both oral and/or written commu nications when passing information from one agency to the next as well as for reports to receiving facilities . It is unde rstood that not all information may be availab le at the tim e of the handoff.

This protocol is intended to guide personnel who do not normally functi on in hazardous materials scenes. If the scene you are responding to is a known or suspected (based on information from dispatch) hazardous materials situation, stage and wait for the hazardous materials personnel. When you have arrived at the scene and find out during scene assessment that hazardous materials are involved, stage and wait for the hazardous materials personnel. All scenes (MVA, Industrial, etc.) should be considered as being a potential hazardous materia ls situation. The following approa cautious all times. b.The reported location may be inaccurate, response into a contaminated area might occur. c.Approach upwind and upgrade if possible. d.Position vehicle wel l away from the incident. e.Communicate your actions to the 9 -1-1 Center. f.Remember: Contaminated and/or exposed response personnel may add to the overall problem and reduce their effectiveness to help. 2.If at an y time you suspect a hazardous mate rials situation: a.Confirm that fire and police have been notified. The agency responsible for hazardous materials response may respond with different levels of personnel and equipment based upon the information receiv ed. Do not always expect a hazardo us materials team to respond. b.If you are a first -in responder, the first priority is scene isolation. c.If you believe that you or your vehicle is contaminated, stage in an isolated area. KEEP OTHERS AWAY! KEEP UNN ECESSARY EQUIPMENT FROM BECOMING CO NTAMINATED. B.Person in Charge 1.If a \"non-hazardous mater ials trained \" paramedic is the first medical person on the scene, he/she should assume the role of PIC (medically) until a \"hazardous materials trained paramed ic\" (HMP) arrives. If possible , the Incident Command Structure sho uld be implemented. 2.The HMP will direct all care. 3.The HMP will determine the method of transport of the exposed patient (air vs. ground). 4.The HMP will determine who will provide care during transport (HMP may remain in that position during tran sport).Operations - Revised 7/08 Hazardous Materials Response - 50.060 Hazardous Materials Response - 50.060 C.Patient Care for the Contaminated Patient 1. Types of incidents which may require decontamination of the patient: a. Radiation b. Biological hazards c. Chemical d. Toxic substances 2. Conta mination can occur though: a. Smoke b. Vapor c. Direct contact d. Run-off 3. Deter mine the hazardous substance involved and provide treatment as directed by HMP . In the absence of an HMP, consult Poison Control through OLMC. 4. The hazardous materials team must be contact ed about removal of contaminated clothing a nd packaging of the patient with regard to your protection and the patient's. D.Ambulance Preparation 1.The HMP shall determine the process needed for ambulance preparation. 2.Remove any supplies and equipment that will be needed for patient care. 3.Seal cabin ets and drape interior, including floor and squad bench, with plastic (available from hazardous materials team). E.Transport and Arrival at the Hospital (if requested by HMP ) 1.If an ambulance has transported a pa tient from an incident that is subseque ntly determined to involve hazardous materials exposure, scene personnel must immediately relay all relevant information to the transporting unit(s) and/or receiving facility(s) involved (via EMS dispatch or OLMC). 2.OLMC and the receiving hospital should be contacted as soon as possible. The EMS providers should communicate the material involved, degree of exposure, decontamination procedures used and patient condition. 3.The ambulance should park in an area away from the emergency room or go directly to a decont amination center or area. 4.Patient(s) should not be brought into the emergency department before the EMS provid ers receive permission from the hospital staff. 5.Once the patient(s) has been released to the hospital , follow the HMP's direction and if necessary double bag the plastic sheeting used to cover the gurney and the floor. Double bag any equipment, which is believed to have become contaminated. 6.After unloading the patient from the ambulance, check with the HMP to see where the ambulance can be safely decont aminated and whether or not there is equipment available for this purpose. Do not begin decontamination without direction from the HMP . After consultation with the Hazardous Materials Team leader , the HMP may recommend that the ambulance be decontaminat ed. 7.Following decontamination recommendations from the HMP , decontaminate the ambulance and personnel before returning to the incident scene. When returning to the incident scene, bring bags containing cont aminated materials, equipment, clothing, etc., and turn them over to the HMP .Operations - Revised 7/08 Hazardous Materials Response - 50.060 Hazardous Materials Response - 50.060 F.EMS Personnel Exposure 1.If an EMS provider is exposed or is concerned with the possibility of exposure, medical help should be sought immediately. 2.Report all exposures to the HMP, Poison Center, and supervisor, and the on- call OHDP nurse. 3.Follow your agencies guidelines for Communicable Disease: Bloodborne/Airborne Pathogens) , including appropriate Personnel Exposure Report. 4.Do not return to service until cleared to do so by the HMP or Poison Center. FOR ADDITIONAL INF ORMATION SEE THE HAZMAT PROTOCOL 50.062 PU RPOSE: To provide guidance to the EMS provider in the care of a patient who has a life- limiting or terminal illness and prefers comfort -focused treatment. INDICATIONS: Patient has a life limiting or terminal illness, prefers comfort -focused treatment, and has one of the following: A.POLST form specifying D NAR/DNR and comfort focused treatment and/or B.Patient is enrolled in hospice care G OALS: A.Reduce patient symptom distress B.Maintain patient dignity by aligning care with stated end-of- life preferences C.Affirm dying as a normal process All interventions should be minimally invasive with the goal to maintain patient comfort Airway \u2014 Position /Suction PRN Breathing \u2014 Oxygen PRN Circulation \u2014Control hemorrhage Position of comfort Review and verify POLST CPR Documentation Discuss home care and/or transport options with patient or person holding legal authority to make medical decisions for the patient. Is the patient on hospice care? Contact hospice nurse and discuss care plan along with the patient and family. Naloxone administration is not advised If there are unresolved issues regarding an appropriate care plan, contact OLMC If the patient has excessive secretions, provide suctioning For pain management/air hunger, nausea/vomiting, or anxiety, see treatment tables . E MS may assist with administration of medications from patient's Hospice eKit if within scope of practice and in coordination with the hospice coordinator/RN/MD. Family members are also often trained in the use of the eKits. Yes No O perations P atients with decision making capacity: If the patient can communicate and has the capacity to make decisions regarding treatment and transport, consult directly with the patient before treatment or transport. P atients without decision making capacity: If the patient lacks the capacity to make decisions regarding treatment or transport, identify any advanced care planning in place for information relating to advanced care planning and consent for treatment, including Advanced care directives POLST Guardian, healthcare power of attorney, or other accepted healthcare proxy NO TES AND PRECAUTIONS: A.Palliative care is specialized care for patients with a chronic and/or terminal illness whic h f ocuses on managing symptoms exacerbation and the stress of illness. B.Hospice care is specialized care , like palliative car e, for patients within the last 6 months of life. C.Patients may not have a DN AR/DNR or POLST form completed and still be enrolled i n hos pice care. D.Careful and thorough assessments should be performed to identify complaints not related to the illness for which the patient is receiving hospice or palliative care. E.Treat dying persons with warmth and understanding. Do not avoid them. Allow them t o di scuss their situation, but do not push them to talk. Ask the person how you might help. F.Many dying people are not upset by discussions of death as long as you do not tak e aw ay all of their hope. Touching a dying person is important. Use words like \"death\". Do not use meaningless synonyms. Give factual information. G.Be aware of your own fears regarding death and admit when a dying person reminds you ofa loved one. I f a situation is too disturbing, have your partner or other members of the responding team take over. H.Social interactions with the family may affect end -of-life care , including psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care. I.Offer support system to help the family cope during the patient's illness and in their ow n ber eavement. J.Care should be delivered with the utmost patience, kindness, and compassion. K.PICC lines may be accessed for use by EMS with sterile techniques. L.Emergency Kits (eKit) may be given to patients by hospice to use at home for acut e s ymptom exacerbation. These eKits are individualized and will be different for eac h pat ient, but typically contain medication that can address pain, nausea/vomiting, anxiety, and/or secretions. Not every hospice service utilizes an eKit . Family members are frequently trained in the use of the eKit M.In collaboration with hospice or palliative care provider, coordinate with guardian, powe r of attorney, or other accepted healthcare proxy if non- transport is considered. N.EMS providers cannot take medical orders from a hospice nurse, but their advice is often invaluable and may be followed with direction from OLMC. Providers can take orders from a hospice physician however, and this can include in the form of a writt en pr escription which may be present in a patient 's eKi t.O perations hospice or palliative care provider is not available or for on sc ene c onflict . P.After medication adminis tration, if no transport occurs, care may be transferred to the hospice nurse or palliative care provider.

This assistance can vary but often involves an individual who has fallen or slipped and is now unable to get up or return to bed without assistance. In all calls from an individual or responsible party requesting lifting assist ance, a medical evaluation must be completed looking for any injury, underlying medical process that contributed to this event, or for a deterioration in functional ability. PROCEDURE: A.Initial evaluation should begin by assessing for any suspected medical cause or inability to mobilize (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, new weakness or balance problem, dehydration/poor oral intake, visual disturbance, recent illness or infection, etc.) . B.Assess vital signs to include HR, RR, BP, SpO 2. In some inst ances, based on patient's past medical history or provider discretion , a temperature, EtCO 2, and blood glucose should also be checked . C.Determine if any acute injury or medical condition exists. D.Ascertain the duration of down time if found on the ground/flo or. Consider hypothermia, compartment syndrome, or rhabdomyolysis. E.Determine if patient is on any oral anticoagulants which may increase risk level for unrecognized bleeding and may prompt the provider to recommend transport. NOTES: A.Lift assist calls can be a sentinel event for someone that is developing a medical emergency or who has crossed the threshold from being able to live independently to someone who needs a little more help (assisted living, etc.) . B.Anyone with impaired mobility that requires assistance to mobilize necessitates an assessment of their health status before deciding that the patient does not require further medical assessment. C.A PCR will be completed on all patient contacts in which a pa tient receives any assessment, assistance (i.e. lift assist), advice , or treatment by EMS . The PCR may be brief, but must include vital signs, any assessment/exam provided, and documentation of the lack of a medical complaint. D.Those who decline transport should be evaluated for medical decision -making capacity and the informed refusal process should be followed . Advise patient that they may call 911 if they develop any symptoms. E.If vitals are unable to be obtained, this must be documented on the PCR along with a reason. F.EMS/Fire agencies may (and are encouraged to) develop their own, more expansive and detailed documentation policies specific to their own operations.Operations - Revised 10/31/18 Multiple Toxic Exposure - 50.070 Multiple Toxic Exposure - 50.070 PURPOSE: To provide guidelines for emergency response personnel on scenes that involve multiple victims who have been exposed to a hazardous material or hazardous environment. This procedure would be used when MSDS and DOT information indicate that victi ms may suffer untoward effects from their exposure and need short -term , continuing medical assessment . It would also apply when victims are symptomatic and have been exposed to a hazardous environment that poses little risk of long -term effects, such as discharge of tear gas. This protocol is NOT intended for use when there are symptomatic patients and the substance they were exposed to is unknown or when there is a potential for serious or long -term medical consequences. PROCEDURE: A.Triage determines that there are multiple victims who have been exposed to a hazardous material or environment, and that these victims are presently asymptomatic or have been exposed to an agent that has transient effects (e.g., tear gas). B.Triage will assist the Hazard ous Materials (trained) Paramedic/EMT (HMP) in coordinating removal of the victims from the potentially hazardous environment, then isolate the victims as best as possible in a safe, well lit, and climate -controlled environment (Consider using a bus or a r oom in a nearby building). If clothing is contaminated, removal of contaminants and proper procedures will be employed prior to isolating victims . C.Access to and egress from the Triage and Treatment Area must be strictly controlled at all times . It is necessary to keep track of patients who are under the care of EM S providers , especially when the patient is a minor and his/her parent(s) are present. Patients should not be allowed to leave the treatment or triage area without Triage or Treatment 's knowl edge. It is recommended that a guard be posted at the entrance and exit to control patient movement. D.The HMP will attempt to determine the type and level of exposure. The HMP will then contact MRH with information on the type of chemical and level of exposure. MRH will consult with Poison Control to determine any symptoms that are to be expected, the approximate time line for onset of symptoms, and recommended treatment modalities. When possible, a three -way phone link among the scene, MRH, and Pois on Center should be arranged. The HMP will report this information to Triage and to Medical . E.All potential patients entering the area will be triage tagged and baseline vitals will be obtained and recorded. It is recommended that the Triage consult w ith the Medical and assign one EM S provider for every 8 to 10 patients. If any exposure victim starts exhibiting symptoms, they will be immediately removed to the designated Treatment Area.Operations - Revised 10/31/18 Multiple Toxic Exposure - 50.070 Multiple Toxic Exposure - 50.070 F.In consultation with MRH, Triage and HMP will make a de termination regarding how long the victims will be observed and the frequency of evaluating and taking vital signs of each patient. A log will be maintained of all patients treated and released. This log will include the patient's name, DOB, the date, sy mptoms (if any), and disposition. 1.If the patients are asymptomatic after the designated observation time, they may be released. The HMP or Triage will individually brief the patients regarding the symptoms they should watch for and should recommend furt her medical evaluation by their own physician. Minor patients should only be released to their parent or guardian. 2.Triage or the HMP will inform Medical of the number of patients being released. G.It is recommended that Medical proceed with initiating p rocedures normally undertaken during an MCI. Regional shall be notified that the all -call is precautionary.Operations - Revised 10/31/18 Medical Control of Scene - 50.110 Medical Control of Scene - 50.11 0 PURPOSE: The purpose of this protocol is to describe who is in charge of patient care on the scene of medical emergencies and how to resolve disputes with other medical professionals in attendance. This protocol does not apply to MCI/MPS events where ICS is established. PROCEDURE: A.EMS Providers On -Scene: The first arriving, highest certified EM S provider will be the Person -In-Charge (PIC) and will assume responsibility for directing overall patient care. The team approach to patient care assessment and treatment should be utilized by the PIC. B.When a higher -level EMS provider arrives, in an EMS role, that individual shall assume the role of PIC, after receiving verbal report from the initial PIC. C.The responsibilities of the PIC directing overal l patient care include: 1.Assuring that treatment, operations, and communications follow protocols. 2.Coordinating patient care activities. This PIC must watch over the entire patient care scene activities and be sure that the patient care activities are being accomplished in a rapid, efficient, and appropriate manner. 3.Directing other EM S providers to establish airway management, start IVs, etc. 4.Establishing the appropriate time to be spent at the scene for doing patient care. 5.Determining when transportation o f the patient is to occur. 6.Performing medical coordination with all agencies and personnel. D.The PIC directing overall patient care will be held responsible and accountable for patient care activities performed at the scene and be identified on all pati ent care reports. E.If a patient requires transport and the first arriving PIC is from a non -transporting agency, provision of patient care will be turned over to the transporting Paramedic or flight personnel when: 1.The patient is placed on the transp ort unit's gurney, OR 2.At a time agreed upon by both EM S providers , continued patient care will then become the responsibility of the transporting unit. There will be a verbal agreement anytime transfer of care from one EM S provider to another takes place. Paramedic Direction On Scene: EMS providers take medical direction from: Physician Supervisors. Regional Protocols. On-Line Medical Control (OLMC) as directed in protocols. Physician On Scene Policy, (within office): A.When EMS is called to a physi cian's office, the EM S providers should receive information from the physician and attempt to provide the service requested by the physician. B.While in the physician's office, the physician shall remain in charge of the patient. The EM S providers may fo llow the direction of the physician if it is within the Scope of Practice and protocols of the PIC. Anytime there is a conflict between a physician's orders and the protocols, OLMC shall be contacted.Operations - Revised 10/31/18 Medical Control of Scene - 50.110 Medical Control of Scene - 50.11 0 C.Once the patient is in the ambulance, unless the physician accompanies the patient, paramedics shall follow the protocols. Physician On -Scene Policy, (outside office): A.Any physician (MD or DO) at the scene of an emergency may be qualified to provide assistance to EM S providers and shall be treated w ith professional courtesy. B.A licensed physician requesting control of patient care at the scene shall be: 1.Thanked for the offer by the PIC. 2.Advised that the EM S providers work under regional protocols and On -Line Medical Control. 3.Advised th at we are not permitted to relinquish medical control to a physician on the scene without agreement from On -Line Medical Control. C.If the physician requesting control is not the patient's \"physician of record,\" EM S providers shall be authorized to proce ed under the direction of the physician ONLY IF ALL THREE OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS ARE MET: 1.OLMC is contacted and authorizes transfer of patient care. 2.The physician agrees to accompany the patient to the hospital in the ambulance. 3.The physi cian agrees to complete and sign the appropriate patient care report. D.If communication with OLMC cannot be established, care may be provided only according to approved ALS protocols. No direction from an on-scene physician may be accepted. Disputes O n-Scene Between EM S providers or Other Medical Professionals: A.Disagreements about care should be handled in a professional manner and shall not detract from patient care. B.To the extent possible, the ALS and BLS protocols shall be followed and provide the basis for resolving disputes. C.If an unresolved dispute continues between EM S providers or other medical professionals concerning the care of a patient, OLMC shall be contacted . D.If a dispute arises which results in transfer of patient care from o ne PIC to another, the approximate time of the transfer shall be included on the patient care report. E.DISPUTES SHALL NOT APPEAR ON PATIENT CARE REPORTS. Written \"Unusual Event Forms\" , or similar form should be completed pursuant to any dispute arising at the scene.Operations - Revised 10/31/18 On-Line Medical Control - 50.115 On-Line Medical Control - 50.115 PURPOSE: This protocol describes the steps an EMS provider should follow in contacting a receiving hospital for On-Line Medical Control (OLMC) and describes the contents of the various reports.

ANY EMT WHO has reasonable cause to believe that a child has either been abused, or witnessed abuse of another child or adult, or who comes into contact with someone who has abused a child, shall report the contact to a law enforcement agency, i.e., any city or municipal police department, any county sheriff's office, or the Oregon State Police AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Passing the report only to a Nurse or Physician does not meet the requirement of the Statute or the Protocol. B.CONT ENT OF REPORT (ORS 419B.015) Paramedic must file an Unusual Event Report with the EMS Office within 12 hours as outlined in the Documentation Protocol. If there is imminent danger to health or life, notify police, the Chief Officer and use your agency notification procedure. The report must contain, if known, the following information: -The names and addresses of the child and parents/person responsible for the child's care. -The child's age. -The nature and extent of abuse (including any evidence of previous abuse). -The explanation given for the abuse. -Any information the official believes may be helpful in establishing the cause of abuse or the perpetrator's identity. IMMUNITY OF PERSONS MAKING REPORTS ( ORS 419.025): Persons who acting in good faith and upon reasonable grounds, report child abuse are immune from civil and criminal liability. Reporting of Suspected Child Abuse - 50.120 Operations - Revised 1/2018 Reporting of Suspected Elder Abuse - 50.121 Reporting of Suspected Elder Abuse - 50.121 PURPOSE: To establish guidelines for the reporting of suspected elder abuse or abuse of a resident in a long term care facility. PROCEDURE: There are two separate elder abuse reporting requirements; a general reporting requirement which applies to patients outside long -term care facilities and a special reporting requirement, which applies to patients of long -term care facilities. DEF INITIONS : A.Abuse: The non-accidental physical injury to an elderly person or patient of a long term cares facility. Abuse also includes: 1.Outside long -term care facilities: a.Neglect means the withholding of services necessary to maintain health and well being. Treatm ent solely by spiritual means is not neglect; however, the person must be voluntarily under the care of an accredited practitioner or in accordance with the practices of a recognized church or religion. b.Abandonment , including desertion or willful forsaking of an elderly person or withdrawal or neglect of duties and obligations owed an elderly person by a caregiver. c.Willful infliction of physical pain or injury. 2.Inside long- term care facilities: a.Illegal or improper use of the patient's financial resources for personal profit or gain. b.Sexual contacts by force, threat, duress or coercion by an employee, agent or other resident. c.Use of derogatory names, phrases, harassment, intimidation, punishment or involuntary seclusion. B.Elderly person - Any person 65 years of age or over. C.Long -term care facility - Any licensed skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility. PROCE DURE: A.DUTY TO REPORT ELDER ABUSE AND PATIENT ABUSE IN A LONG TERM CARE FACILITYAn EMT who has reasonable cause to believe that an elderly person has been abused, or who comes into contact with someone who has abused an elderly person, shall file an Unusual Event Report with the EMS Office within 12 hours as outlined in the Documentation Protocol. If there is imminent danger to health or life, notify police, or DHS . DHS: 503-304-3400 or 1-800-232-3020. Passing the report only to a Nurse or Physician does not meet the requirement of the Statute or the Protocol. B.CONTENT OF REPORT The elder abuse report must contain, if known, the following information: -The names and addresses of both the elderly person and anyone responsible for his/her care. -The nature and extent of abuse including any evidence of previous abuse. -The explanation given for the abuse. -Any information the official believes may be helpful in establishing the cause of abuse.Operations - Revised 1/2018 Reporting of Suspected Elder Abuse - 50.121 Reporting of Suspected Elder Abuse - 50.121 C.IMMUNITY OF PERSONS MAKING REPORTS Persons participating in good faith in making a report of elder abuse and who have reasonable gro unds for making it are immune from civil and criminal liability including participation in any judicial proceeding resulting from their report. Persons making such a report of abuse of a patient in a long term care facility in addition have immunity from any criminal liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed with respect to making such a report .Regional EMS Patient Treatment Protocols - 2023 Section 60.000 Trauma System Operations - Revised - 10/26/2012 Trauma System Guidelines - 60.100 Trauma System Guidelines - 60.100 I.PATIENT ENTRY : Operations - Revised - 10/26/2012 Trauma System Guidelines - 60.100 Trauma System Guidelines - 60.100 Operations - Revised - 10/26/2012 Trauma System Guidelines - 60.100 Trauma System Guidelines - 60.100 II.MEDICAL DIRECTION: A.Off-line medical direction for trauma patients is controlled by the Treatment Protocols. B.OLMC is provided by Medical Resource Hospital (MRH). OLMC may override off-line medical direction. Any instances where this occurs will be reported to the EMS Office. III. COMMUNICATIONS: A.Communications with OLMC: The following information will be provided: 1.Unit number and the location of the incident. 2.Number of patients. 3.Age and sex of the patients. 4.Trauma system entry criteria and vital signs. 5.Glasgow Coma Scale. 6.Trauma tag number. 7.ETA to Trauma Center. 8.Patient destination based on incident location or request. B.Communications from OLMC to the paramedics in the field will be as follows: 1.OLMC will inform the paramedic if more information is needed by the trauma center. 2.OLMC will inform the paramedic if the chosen trauma center is unable to receive the patie nt and will assist in designating an alternate destination. 3.In the event that there are multiple Trauma System entries, OLMC may assist the paramedic at the scene in determining the destinations of all patients. IV. TRAUMA CENTER DESTINATION: A.Santiam Hospital ER: B.Salem Hospital ER: C.Air Ambulance Activation: An air ambulance should be used when it would reduce total pre-hospital time by 10 minutes or greater. This is usually achieved whenever the ground transport time will exceed 25 minutes (Scene is > 15 miles from Salem or other circumstances exist).Operations - Revised - 10/26/2012 Trauma System Guidelines - 60.100 Trauma System Guidelines - 60.100 C.Patients or Guardians Request: If the alert, competent patient or his/her competent guardian demands transport to a specific hospital, the EMT must honor that request and notify the TCC immediately. D.Multiple Patients: From the same scene, all patient destinations are to be that assigned by the above service areas unless the designated Trauma Center advises the that the facility cannot accept additional patients. In this instance, the OLMC will assist the paramedic in determining patient destinations. If there are more than two critical trauma patients (e.g., intubated, significant trauma) ready to be transported from the same scene, only the first two will be sent to the Level 1 facility designated by catchment area. Subsequent patients shall be directed to the next Level 1 center. E.Diversio n to Local Hospital: If the paramedic is unable to establish an airway, the patient should be transported to the nearest acute care facility. V.PATIENT EVALUATION PROTOCOL: A.Treatment priority should be approached in this order: 1.Airway Maintenance (Including control of the cervical spine). 2.Breathing. 3.Control of circulation and hemorrhage. 4.Treatment of shock. 6.Complete secondary survey. 7.Splinting of fractures. VI.SCENE TIME: After gaining access to the patient, scene time should not exceed ten minutes for any patient who is entering the Trauma System. Plan to start IV/IOs and initiate other care once en-route to the hospital if necessary.Regional EMS Patient Treatment Protocols - 2023 Section 65.000 Multi -Casualty Incidents Multi -Casualty Incidents - Revised 8/09 MCI General Guidelines - 65.100 MCI General Guidelines - 65.100 The National Incident Management System (NIMS) will be used to manage all incidents. 1.Incident Command (IC) is the responsibility of the agency having jurisdiction (AHJ). 2.Each assisting agency shall retain full authority to operate within the scope of i ts agency operational and administrative protocols and procedures. 3.Agencies that are assisting in the support of a single jurisdiction will function under the direction of that jurisdiction's designated Unified Incident Command. 4.Incident Command of a mul ti-discipline event should be predicated on the \"Primary Hazard\" of the event. 5.In a Unified Command, the \"Lead Agency\" may change as priorities change. The Mass Casualty Incident Protocol is a tool that may be used in part or whole as determined by the on-scene Incident Commander in situations where the number of patients exceeds the resources of the on -scene responders. There is no set number of patients that will automatically initiate this protocol . If the Incident commander determines that additional resources or incident structure is needed to better manage due to the complexity of the incident, he/she shall announce to dispatch that an MCI is being declared. This may be done upon arrival or at any time during the incident. If the incident involves multiple asymptomatic patients (HazMat exposure) set up secure evaluation area. See Multiple Toxic Exposure protocol. During a declared MCI, the Trauma System is not in effect. \"Licensed ambulances\" are not needed for transport. If transport resources are limited, more than one critical patient may be placed in an ambulance.Multi - Causality Incidents - Revised 8/09 Medical Task Card - 65.200 Card 1 of 2 MCI Task Card - Medical Reports to Incident Commander (or Operations in larger incidents) OBJECTIVES: 1.Coordinate all On -Scene EMS activity. 2.Coordinate Medical activities with Incident Commander (IC), and other ICS branches as needed. 3.Provide accountability for supervised perso nnel.

Others may be transferred immediately to the Support Zone. A. Decontamination 1. Victims who are able and co operative may assist with their own decontamination. a.Rapidly remove contaminated clothing while flushing exposed skin and hair with plain water for 2 to 3 minutes . b.Then wash twice with mild soap . c.Rinse thoroughly with water . d.Double bag conta minated clothing and personal belongings . 2. Irrigate exposed or irritated eyes with plain water or saline for 5 minutes. a.Continue eye irrigation during other basic care or transport. b.Remove contact lenses if present and easily removable without additional trauma to the eye . B. Transfer to Support Zone as soon as decontamination is complete.Hazar dous Materials - Revised 11/9/2021 Hydrogen Cyanide - 70.020 Hydrogen Cyanide - 70.020 IDENTIFICATION CAS 74 Synonyms include formic and formonitrile. are referred to as hydrocyanic acid and prussic acid. Hydrogen cyanide is very volatile, producing potentially lethal concentrations at room temperature. At temperature below 78 F, hydrogen cyanide is colorless or pale blue liquid (hydrocyanic acid); at higher temperatures, it is a colorless gas. It has a faint bitter almond odor and a bitter burning taste. It is soluble in water. Hydrogen cya nide is lighter than air. PRECAUTIONS A. Persons whose clothing or skin is contaminated with cyanide containing solutions can secondarily contaminate personnel by direct contact or through off -gassing vapor. 1.Avoid dermal contact with cyanide -contaminated victims and their bodily fluids. 2.Take special care with victims who may have ingested cyanide, as cyanide salts dissolve in the stomach and react with hydrochloric acid to produce hydrogen cyanide gas. Transport patients in vehicles with windows opened a nd/or good ventilation. These patients who meet Death in the Field criteria should be considered a Hot Zone. 3.Victims exposed only to hydrogen cyanide gas do not pose contamination risks to rescuers. B. Hydrogen cyanide is a volatile flammable liquid at r oom temperature; as a gas, it is flammable and potentially explosive. C. Hydrogen cyanide is absorbed well by inhalation and can produce death within minutes. 1. Substantial absorption can occur through intact skin if vapor concentration is high. 2. Exp osure by any route may cause systemic effects. HEALTH EFFECTS HCN is classified a systemic (chemical) asphyxiant. Cyanides interfere with the intracellular utilization of oxygen resulting in cellular dysfunction and cell death. Effects are most profound and first evidenced in the CNS and cardiovascular system. Initial symptoms may include CNS excitation and cardiovascular compensation followed by depression/collapse of both systems. ROUTES OF EXPOSURE A. Inhalation 1. Hydrogen cyanide is readily ab sorbed from the lungs; symptoms of poisoning begin within seconds to minutes . 2. The odor of cyanide does not provide adequate warning of hazardous concentrations . Perception of the odor is a genetic trait (20% to 40% of the general population cannot det ect hydrogen cyanide); also, rapid olfactory fatigue can occur. B. Skin/Eye Contact: Exposure to hydrogen cyanide can cause skin and eye irritation and can contribute to systemic poisoning with delayed symptoms. C. Ingestion of hydrogen cyanide solutions or cyanide salts can be rapidly fatalHazar dous Materials - Revised 11/9/2021 Hydrogen Cyanide - 70.020 Hydrogen Cyanide - 70.020 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS A.Signs and symptoms usually develop rapidly. Initial symptoms are nonspecific and include excitement, dizziness, n/v, HA and weakness. B.Progressive signs and symptoms may include: Drowsiness, tetani c spasm, convulsions, hallucinations and loss of C.Cardiovascular - Can cause various life-threatening dysrhythmias. D.Respiratory 1.Victims may complain of shortness of breath and chest tightness . 2.Pulmonary findings may include rapid breathing an d increased depth of respiration . 3.As poisoning progresses, respirations become slow and gasping; cyanosis may be present, and pulmonary edema may develop . RESCUER PROTECTION A. Respiratory protection: Pressure demand self -contained breathing apparatus (S CBA) is recommended in response situations that involve exposure to potentially unsafe levels of hydrogen cyanide . B. Skin protection: Chemical protective clothing is recommended because both hydrogen cyanide vapor and liquid can be absorbed through the s kin to produce systemic toxicity . DECONTAMINATION ZONE A. Refer to Decontamination page. B. Transfer to Support Zone as soon as decontamination is complete. SUPPORT ZONE A. Be certain that victims have been decontaminated properly. Additional decont amination may be required for exposed skin and eyes. B. Decontaminated victims or those exposed only to vapor, pose no serious risks of secondary contamination to rescuers. In these cases, Support Zone personnel require no specialized protective gear. TREATMENT Patients who rapidly regain consciousness and who have no other signs or symptoms may not require antidote treatment. Patients who remain comatose or develop shock should be treated promptly with the antidotes per OLMC direction. In cases of ingestionemesis and activated charcoal are contraindicated . A.High flow oxygen, establish IV access, apply cardiac monitor and secure protected airway following Airway Management protocol. B.If Cyanide Toxicity is suspected based on findings (soot in mouth, nos e or oropharynx, know exposure) and patient is comatose, in cardiac or respiratory arrest, or has persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation: 1.Administer Hydroxocobalamin (C YANOKIT\u00ae) 5 g IV or IO over 15 minutes. Repeat once if needed. For cardiac arrest, hydroxocobala min should be administered as a rapid fluid bolus. 2.If Hydroxocobalamin (C YANOKIT\u00ae) is not available, then administer Sodium Thiosulfate 50 ml of 25% solution over 10 -20 minutes. Pediatric dose is 1.65 ml/kg .Hazar dous Materials - Revised 11/9/2021 Hydrogen Cyanide - 70.020 Hydrogen Cyanide - 70.020 3.Do NOT administer Hydroxocobalamin (C YANOKIT\u00ae) and Sodium Thiosulfate to the same patient. 4.Treat other presenting symptoms per appropriate protocol. 5.Initiate emergent transport to appropriate facility. 6.Patients in shock or having seizures should be treated according to existing protocols. These patie nts may be seriously acidotic; consider giving sodium bicarbonate 50 mEq, with OLMC direction. C.MULTI -CASUALTY TRIAGE - Patients who have only brief inhalation exposure and mild or transient symptoms may be discharged.Hazardous Materials - Revised 10/26/2021 Hydrogen Fluoride - 70.030 and fluorine monohydride. Hydrogen fluoride is a colorless, corrosive fuming liquid or gas (boiling temperature 67oF) with a strong irritating odor. It is usually shipped in cylinders as a compressed gas. Hydrogen fluoride readily dissolves in water to form colorless hydrofluoric acid solutions. Dilute solutions are indistinguishable from water. It is present in a variety of over-the-counter products at concentrations of 6% to 12%. PRECAUTIONS A.Victims whose clothing or skin is contaminated with HF liquid, solution or condensed vapor, can secondarily contaminate response personnel by direct contact or through off-gassing vapor. B.Inhalation hazards result not only from HF gas but also from fumes arising from concentrated hydrogen fluoride liquid or from the patient's bodily fluids. C.Rapid flushing of exposed areas with water is critical. HF is water -soluble. HEALTH E FFECTS The toxic effects of hydrogen fluoride are due primarily to the fluoride ion. The fluoride ion combines with endogenous calcium and to form insoluble calcium fluoride and magnesium fluoride. A.This results in cell demineralization . B.Life threatening hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperkalemia can occur. C.The adverse action of the fluoride ion may progress for several days . ACUTE EXPOSURE A.Respiratory Due to HF's water solubility, effects of exposure generally occur in the upper airway including the glottis. However, people incapacitated in large clouds of HF can have severe deep lung injury. 1.Mild effects mucous membrane irritation, cough and narrowing of the bronchi. 2.Severe effects : a.Almost immediat e narrowing and swelling of the throat, causing upper airway obstruction. b.Lung injury may evolve rapidly or may be delayed in onset for 12 to 36 hours. c.Pulmonary edema and constriction of the bronchi. Partial or complete lung collapse can occur . d.Pulmonary effects can result even from splashes on the skin. B.DermalDepending on the concentration and duration of exposure, skin contact may produce pain, redness of the skin, and deep, slow healing burns with symptoms delayed up to 24 hours. HF can penetrate tissues deeply, causing both local cellular destruction and systemic toxicity.Hazardous Materials - Revised 10/26/2021 Hydrogen Fluoride - 70.030 Hydrogen Fluoride - 70.030 effects Rapid onset of eye irritation . 2.More severe effects May result from even minor hydrofluoric acid splash include, sloughing of the surface of the eye, swelling of the structures of the eye, and cell death due to lack of blood supply. Potentially permanent clouding of the eye surface may develop immediately or after several days . D.Gastrointestinal 1.A small amount of ingested HF is likely to produce systemic effects including acid-base imbalance and may be fatal. 2.Ingestion of hydrofluoric acid may cause corrosive injury to the mouth, throat and esophagus as well as inflammation and bleeding of the stomach. 3.Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , and abd ominal pain may occur . E.Electrolyte disturbances Exposure by any route may result in systemic effects: Hypocalcemia and/or hypomagnesemia and/or hyperkalemia. PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT HOT ZONE Rescuer Protection A.SCBA is recommended in response situat ions that involve exposure to potentially unsafe levels of hydrogen fluoride . B.Skin protection: Chemical protective clothing, i.e. level A or level B, is recommended because skin exposure to either vapor or liquid may cause severe consequences. DECONTAMINA TION ZONE A. Victims exposed only to hydrogen fluoride gas or vapor who have no skin or eye irritation do not need decontamination, they may be transferred immediately to the Treatment Area. B. Rescuer Protection: If exposure levels are determined to be safe, personnel wearing a lower level of protection than that worn in the Hot Zone may conduct decontamination. C. ABC Reminders : 1. Quickly ensure a patent airway anticipate airway edema. 2. Stabilize the cervical spine with a c -collar and a backboard if trauma is suspected . 3. Administer supplemental O 2. 4. Assist ventilation with a bag -valve -mask device if necessary . D. Basic decontamination : 1. Victims who are able and cooperative may assist with their own decontamination a.RAPIDLY REMOVE CONTAMIN ATED CLOTHING while flushing exposed skin and hair with plain water for 15 minutes. b.If treatment recommended below is available, water flushing may be reduced to 5 minutes and the treatment should be started immediat ely.

As soon as basic deconta minatio n is complete, move the victim to the Treatment Area. TREATMENT Be certain that victims have been decontaminated properly. Treatment Area personnel require no specialized protective gear if victims have undergone decontamination. A.ABCs, C -spine (p rn), Pu lse Oximetry, and ECG to obtain baseline QT interval (may be of benefit for this ). B.Treat patients who are symptomatic per existing protocols. C.Observe for signs of hypocalcemia and contact OLMC regarding treatment Calcium is probabl e ingestion amounts of HF. inhalation Gluconate with rmal Sa line into the nebulizer. 2.If wheezes are present, consider use of Albuterol per R espiratory Distress protocol. E.Minor Burns . 1.Initially, the health care provider should wear rubber or latex gloves to prevent secondary contamination . 2.Calcium gluconate 3 g mixed with 5 oz water soluble lubricant and applied to burn. 3.Continue this procedure until pain is relieved or more definit ive care is rendered . F.Hand Exposure 1.Subungual (under the nail) burns often do not respond to immers ion treatment. The treatment for hand burns requires expert assistance; consult with OLMC . 2.Treatment of hand expo sures can be accomplished by placing ca lcium gluconate gel into an exam glove and placing the glove on the affected hand. G.Optical Exposure Irrigate exposed eyes with a 1% aqueous solution of calcium gluconate (10 ml of 10% solution in 90 ml of sterile saline in Buretrol) using a nasal cannula. 1.Up to 500 ml over 1 to 2 hours may be used . 2.If calcium gluconate is not available, use normal sal ine for irrigation.Hazardous Materials - Revised 10/26/2021 Hydrogen Fluoride - 70.030 Hydrogen Fluoride - 70.030 MULTI -CASUALTY TRIAGE Consult with the OLMC for advice regarding triage of multiple victims. Persons who have had only minor or brief exposure to hydrogen fluoride gas or vapor and are initially asymptomatic are not likely to develo p complications. See Multiple Toxic Exposure Protocol. Hazardous Materials - Revised 10/26/20 21 Organophosphates - 70.040 Organophosphate s - The term organophosphate (OP) is generally understood to mean an organic derivative of phosphoric or similar acids. There are many different OPs and they differ to some extent in their properties. Many OPs inhibit an enzyme known as acetylcholinesterase. This is a class effect of OPs, but not all OPs (e.g. glyphosate) demonstrate this effect. Inhibi tors of acetylcholinesterase affect certain nerve junctions in animals, as well as parasympathetic effector sites (the heart, lungs, stomach, intestines, urinary bladder, prostate, eyes and salivary glands). By inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, OPs prevent the nerve junction from functioning properly. PRECAUTIONS A. Organophosphates are highly contaminating. B. Victims whose skin or clothing is contaminated with liquid or powdered organophosphate can secondarily contaminate response personnel by direct contact or off gassing of solvent vapor. C. Clothing and leather goods (e.g., belts or shoes) cannot be reliably decontaminated; they should be incinerated. A.Special care should be taken to avoid contact with the vomitus of a patient who has ingested organophosphate. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES A.At room temperature, organophosphate are powders or combustible liquids. B.Organophosphates are almost insoluble in water, slightly soluble in petroleum oils, and miscible with many organic solvents. Accordingly, mos t commercial products contain hydrocarbon solvents. C.Organophosphates have low vapor pressures; thus significant inhalation is unlikely at normal temperatures (Exception: Dichlorvos (a.k.a. DDVP and Vapona) when in a poorly ventilated confined space). Howe ver, the hydrocarbon solvents remain volatile and flammable, as well as possessing toxic properties. ROUTES OF EXPOSURE A. Inhalation : 1. Toxic inhalation of organophosphate vapor is unlikely at ordinary temperatures because of its low volatility, but t oxic effects can occur after inhalation of organophosphate sprays or dusts . 2. The hydrocarbon solvents (most commonly toluene and xylene) used to dissolve organophosphate are more volatile than organophosphate itself, and toxicity can result from inhalat ion of solvent vapor as well . B. Skin/Eye Contact Organophosphates are rapidly absorbed through intact skin or eyes, contributing to systemic toxicity. C. Ingestion Acute toxic effects. May be rapidly fatal.Hazardous Materials - Revised 10/26/20 21 Organophosphates - 70.040 Organophosphate - 70.040 HEALTH A. Introduction: 1. Orga nophosphates are known as cholinesterase inhibitors. Normally, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down by acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Organophosphates inhibit the activity of AChE and thus ACh is not broken down. The resulting accumulat ion of ACh overstimulates ACh receptors (aka cholinergic receptors) within the central and peripheral nervous systems. The toxic effects of organophosphates result from this overstimulation of ACh receptors. There are two types of ACh receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic. 2.Signs and symptoms of poisoning vary according to age, dose, and concentration : a.CNS effects Irritability, nervousness, giddiness, fatigue, lethargy, impairment of memory, confusion, slurred speech, visual disturbance, depression, impaire d gait, convulsions, loss of consciousness, coma, and respiratory depression. CNS effects can be some of the earliest symptoms. b.PNS EffectsNicotinic and muscarinic stimulation can provide opposing effects. In general, nicotinic signs and symptoms predom inate early in organophosphate poisoning, while muscarinic signs SCBA is recommended in response situations that involve exposure to potentially unsafe levels of organophosphates. B.Skin Protection: Chemical -protective clothing is recommended because organophosphates are rapidly absorbed through the skin and may cau se systemic poisoning. DECONTAMINATION ZONE All victims suspected of organophosphate ingestion, or substantial exposure to aerosolized organophosphates, or who have skin or eye exposure to liquid or powdered organophosphates require thorough decontaminati on. BASIC DECONTAMINATION Follow Decontamination General Guidelines. Then, move the victim to the Treatment Area upon completion. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS A. Mild poisoning HA, n/v, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. B. Moderate poisoning: Generalized muscle we akness and twitching, slurred speech, pinpoint pupils, excessive secretions, and shortness of breath.Hazardous Materials - Revised - 70.040 C.Severe poisoning: Seizures, skeletal -muscle paralysis, respiratory failure, and coma. TREATMENT A.Secure protected airway in cases of respiratory comprom ise per Airway Management protocol. B.There is no contra -indication to the use of paralytic agents is in this setting, however both succinylcholine and vecuronium will have a significantly sustained duration of paralysis in the presence of organophosphates . C.The initial intravenous dose of atropine in adults should be determined by the severity of symptoms. In seriously poisoned patients, very large doses may be required. Alterations of pulse rate and pupillary size are unreliable indicators of treatment adeq uacy. Atropine works only to correct muscarinic effects. 1.In mild to moderate poisonings (e.g. headache, mild bronchorrhea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea but normal mentation) , administer atropine 1 -2 mg IV/IO /IM every 3-5 minutes until symptoms improve . 2.For severe poisoning (e.g. altered mental status, unconsciousness , seizures ), administer atropine 3-5 mg IV/IO /IM every 3 -5 minutes until symptoms begin to improve. 3.Treat seizures per seizure protocol. D. Administ er pralidoxime (2 -PAM), if profound wea kness or paralysis present. 1.Moderate symptoms 1,200 mg ( Mark 1 injector s or one Duodote symptoms 1,800 mg s or three Duodote CAUTION : When administering 2 -PAM intraveno usly, administer at rate of less than 200 mg/minute, (4 mg/minute for children). Note: The Mark 1 auto-Injector atropine is 2 mg . The 2 -Pam auto -injector is 600 mg pralidoxime. The Duodote Auto -Injector is atropine 2.1 mg/0.7 mL and pralidoxime chloride 600 mg/2 mL . E. Patients who are com atose, hypotensive, have seizures or cardiac dysrhythmias should be treated according to ALS protocols. TRANSPORT TO MEDICAL FACILITY A. Report to OLMC, and the receiving medical facility, the condition of the patie nt, treatment given, and estimated time of arrival at the medical facility. B. If organophosphate has been ingested: 1. Prepare the ambulance in case the victim vomits toxic material. 2. Prepare several towels (or other absorbent material) and open pla stic bags to quickly clean up and isola te vomitus . MULTI -CASUALTY TRIAGE Patients who have histories or evidence suggesting substantial exposure and all persons who have ingested organophosphate should be transported to a medical facility for evaluation. Hazardous Materials - Revised 10/26/20 21 Organophosphates - 70.040 Organophosphate s - 70.040 A.Others may be discharged from the sce ne after their names, addresses, and telephone numbers are recorded. B.They should be advised to seek medical care promptly if symptoms develop or recur. PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: Atropine: In children, dos e is 0.05 IV/IO . Pralidoxime: Pediatric dose: 25 to 50 mg/kg and must be given slowly via IV (4 mg/min.)
