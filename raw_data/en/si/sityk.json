Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a complete medical system that has been used to diagnose, treat, and prevent illnesses for more than 2,000 years. TCM is based on a belief in yin and yang \u2014defined as opposing energies, such as earth and heaven, winter and summer, and happiness and sadness. When yin and yang are in balance, you feel relaxed and energized. Out of balance, however, yin and yang negatively affect your health. All kinds of ailments can be treated by traditional Chinese medicine; some diseases may be more effectively treated by acupuncture, others are more effectively treated by herbs, and still others may be treated by food cures. In general, pain and muscular symptoms are treated by acupuncture, and skin diseases are treated by herbs. TCM includes various forms of dietary therapy, herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage (Tui na), and exercise (quigong). In all cases, it is necessary for a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine to make a diagnosis before deciding on an appropriate treatment. TCM diagnosis begins by tracing symptoms to patterns of an underlying disharmony by measuring the pulse, inspecting the tongue, skin and eyes, and learning about the patient's eating and sleeping habits.
