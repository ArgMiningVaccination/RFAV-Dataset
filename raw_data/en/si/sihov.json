It is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). TCM theory and practice are not based upon scientific knowledge, and acupuncture is a pseudoscience. There is a diverse range of acupuncture theories based on different philosophies, and techniques vary depending on the country. The method used in TCM is likely the most widespread in the United States. It is most often used for pain relief, though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions. Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment. The conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent, which suggests that it is not effective Acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single-use needles When properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections. Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications. Needles vary in length between 13 to 130 millimetres (0.51 to 5.12 in), with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues; needle diameters vary from 0.16 mm (0.006 in) to 0.46 mm (0.018 in), with thicker needles used on more robust patients. Conditions for treatment by acupuncture are 1.Pain 2.Lower back pain 3.Migraine 4.Arthritis and joint pains 5.Post operative pain 6.Nausea assosiated with cancer 7.Fatigue and sleep Massage is to work and act on the body with pressure. Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, elbows, knees, forearm, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. People who are professionally trained to give massages were traditionally known as massage therapist . in professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a massage table, sitting in a massage chair, or lying on a mat on the floor. In amateur settings, a general purpose surface like a bed or the floor is more common Muscles and soft tissues are pressed, rubbed and manipulated. Massage breaks the cycle in which the nervous system stimulates muscles to contract causing pain. Muscles relax and lengthen Pain relieving oxygen and blood floods the muscles The process of \"touch\" also is relaxing and therapeutic Water is applied to the body to stimulate and redirect the flow of blood and lymph. This nourishes cells and promotes regeneration of the tissues. Heat causes the arteries and veins to expand and bring in blood and lymph. Cold make the arteries and veins constrict, pushing blood and lymph away. This in-and-out movement of blood and lymph brings fresh oxygen and nutrients and helps removes toxins and waste. Hydrotherapy, formerly called hydropathy and also called water cure, is a part of alternative medicine, in particular of naturopathy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, that involves the use of water for pain relief and treatment. The term encompasses a broad range of approaches and therapeutic methods that take advantage of the physical properties of water, such as temperature and pressure, for therapeutic purposes, to stimulate blood circulation and treat the symptoms of certain diseases. Various therapies used in the present-day hydrotherapy employ water jets, underwater massage and mineral baths A hydrotherapy pool is a swimming pool specifically designed for providing hydrotherapy treatments. The main difference is the increase in temperature. A hydrotherapy pool is heated to around 35 degrees Celsius. This allows for the patient to fully relax (and not tense up in cold water), promotes pain relief and encourages circulation. A hydrotherapy pool should be rectangular in shape and may vary in depth to allow for walking as well as deep water work. It should be easily accessible and have a hoist available to lower in those who are not able to enter the pool themselves. Hydrotherapy can be very useful in treating many different types of soft tissue and bone injury as well as neuromuscular conditions such as muscular dystrophy. The benefits of hydrotherapy include: Pain relief. Reduction in muscle spasm. Increased joint range of motion. Strengthening of weak muscles. Increased circulation. Improvement of balance and co-ordination. Re-education of paralysed muscles. Because of the buoyancy of the water, hydrotherapy allows many individuals to exercise, where they wouldn't be able to on land. The effect of this increased buoyancy and decreased gravitational force means that there is less stress on weight bearing joints such as the knees and hips and many movements can be performed in water before they would be possible on land. Hydrotherapy may be useful in the following conditions: Arthritis - both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Back pain. Musculoskeletal conditions - such as frozen shoulder, ankle sprains and groin strains etc. Following surgery for conditions such as knee replacement, hip replacement, ACL reconstruction (Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL reconstruction) is a surgical tissue graft replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament, located in the knee, to restore its function after an injury.) etc. Fibromyalgia (Fibromyalgia syndrome affects the muscles and soft tissue. Symptoms include chronic muscle pain, fatigue, sleep problems, and painful tender points or trigger points, which can be relieved through medications, lifestyle changes and stress management). Neurological conditions including Muscular Dystrophy, Cerebral Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinsons Disease etc. After strokes or head injuries. Used for 5000 years in ayurvedic medicines Stimulate digestion Boosts immune system Eliminate toxins Heal infections Natural Juice Therapy (NJT) has been used in one guise or another for many centuries. It has been used by some of the world's most renowned leaders in nutritional therapy for use in the prevention and treatment of disease. NJT uses the unique blend of healing properties found within the natural juices of fruits and vegetables to aid the body to optimum health. Freshly extracted fruit and vegetable juices furnish the body with the perfect balance of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, carbohydrates, anti- oxidants and enzymes. The nutritional benefits of juicing are well documented. There is a tremendous amount of evidence supporting the use of Natural Juice Therapy for the treatment of virtually all- common ailments, as well as more serious health conditions. At its most fundamental, the pure liquid contained within every fruit and vegetable designed for human consumption, was designed by nature to both feed and heal the body. When you extract the fresh juices from the fruit and vegetables and drink them, the fresh nutrients are more 'bioavailable' to your cells. 95% of all the nutrients are retained in the juice. We believe in disease is caused by either 'Toxicity' and/or 'Deficiency'. Remove the incoming toxicity (junk food; heavily processed foods; cigarettes; alcohol; external pollutants; artificial substances; etc) and replace any nutrient deficiency with the aid of freshly extracted fruit and vegetable juices; pure whole foods; clean water; etc, and the vast majority of disease improves dramatically. A Natural Juice Therapist will address your personal 'deficiency vs. toxicity' and will recommend the use of natural juicing to readdress the balance to achieve optimum health and vibrancy. Natural Juice Therapy has helped millions of people around the world with a number of health conditions. From high blood pressure to gout; skin conditions to heart conditions; lethargy to weight problems. You name it and Natural Juice Therapy has at some stage been used to help treat it. A Natural Juice Therapist will not diagnose or claim to cure, but will simply present the information and scientific research to support the knowledge that freshly extracted juicing can be extremely beneficial in the treatment of almost every common aliment. To see if Natural Juice Therapy is right for you, simply contact your local therapist. The Bach Flower Remedy (BFRs) is a solution of brandy and water. The water containing extreme dilutions of flower material developed by Edward Bach, an English homeopath, in the 1930s. Bach claimed that dew found on flower petals retain imagined healing properties of that plant. Systematic reviews of clinical trials of Bach flower solutions have found no efficacy beyond a placebo effect. There were total 38 remedies included in this BFR. Each of the 38 remedies discovered by Dr Bach is directed at a particular characteristic or emotional state. To select the remedies you need, think about the sort of person you are and the way you are feeling. Agrimony - mental torture behind a cheerful face Aspen - fear of unknown things Beech - intolerance Centaury - the inability to say 'no' Cerato - lack of trust in one's own decisions Cherry Plum - fear of the mind giving way Chestnut Bud - failure to learn from mistakes Chicory - selfish, possessive love Clematis - dreaming of the future without working in the present Crab Apple - the cleansing remedy, also for self-hatred Elm - overwhelmed by responsibility Gentian - discouragement after a setback(delay of process) Gorse - hopelessness and despair Heather - self-centredness and self-concern Holly - hatred, envy and jealousy Honeysuckle - living in the past Hornbeam - tiredness at the thought of doing something Impatiens - impatience Larch - lack of confidence Mimulus - fear of known things Mustard - deep gloom (tension) for no reason Oak - the plodder(hard working) who keeps going past the point of exhaustion Olive - exhaustion following mental or physical effort Pine - guilt Red Chestnut - over-concern for the welfare of loved ones Rock Rose - terror and fright Rock Water - self-denial, rigidity and self-repression Scleranthus - inability to choose between alternatives Star of Bethlehem - shock Sweet Chestnut - Extreme mental anguish, when everything has been tried and there is no light left Vervain - over-enthusiasm Vine - dominance and inflexibility Walnut - protection from change and unwanted influences Water Violet - quiet self-reliance leading to isolation White Chestnut - unwanted thoughts and mental arguments Wild Oat - uncertainty over one's direction in life Wild Rose - drifting, resignation, apathy Willow - self-pity and resentment The original system also includes an emergency combination remedy. Other pre-mixed combinations are offered by many remedy producers, but they tend to be ineffective because they are not chosen individually. Dr. Edward Bach discovered that flowers in nature has the ability to affect our emotions positively. The energies from different flowers can remove our emotional pains and suffering. He made sure that when he died in 1936 that his original Bach Flower system would be simple and easy for everyone to understand and use. The Bach Flower Remedies work in conjunction with herbs, homeopathy and medications and are safe for everyone, including children, pregnant women, pets, elderly and even plants. \"The Greatest gift that you can give to others is to be happy and hopeful yourself; then you draw them up out of their despondency.\" Edward Bach The original Bach Flower Remedies is a safe and natural method of healing discovered by Dr. Bach from 1920 - 1930's in England. They gently restore the balance between mind and body by casting out negative emotions such as fear, worry, hatred and indecision which interfere with the equilibrium of the being as a whole. The Bach Flower Remedies allow peace and happiness to return to the sufferer so that the body is free to heal itself The Bach Flower Remedies are made from wild flowers and are safe for the whole family including pets. Homeo means similar and pathy means suffering Homeopathy or homopathy is a system of alternative medicine created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on his doctrine of like cures like (similia similibus curentur), a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people Homeopathy is a pseudoscience - a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific. Homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any condition, large-scale studies have found homeopathy to be no more effective than a placebo, indicating that any positive effects that follow treatment are only due to the placebo effect, normal recovery from illness Homeopathy is not a plausible system of treatment, as its dogmas about how drugs, illness, the human body, liquids and solutions operate are contradicted by a wide range of discoveries across biology, psychology, physics and chemistry made in the two centuries since its invention Although some clinical trials produce positive results, multiple systematic reviews have indicated that this is because of chance, flawed research methods, and reporting bias. Homeopathic practice has been criticized as unethical because it discourages the use of effective treatments, with the World Health Organization warning against using homeopathy to try to treat severe diseases such as HIV and malaria. Hahnemann ingested some bark specifically to investigate what would happen. He experienced fever, shivering and joint pain: symptoms similar to those of malaria itself. From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they treat, in accord with the \"law of similars\" that had been proposed by ancient physicians. An account of the effects of eating cinchona bark noted by Oliver Wendell Holmes, and published in 1861, failed to reproduce the symptoms Hahnemann reported. In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher \"potency\", and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting. The end product is often so diluted as to be indistinguishable from the diluent (pure water, sugar or alcohol). Two methods of dilution prepartion 1. Centecimal 2. Decimal Acupressure is an alternative medicine technique similar in principle to acupuncture. It is based on the concept of life energy which flows through \"meridians\" in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to acupuncture points with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians. Pressure may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices. Some medical studies have suggested that acupressure may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, for helping lower back pain, tension headaches, stomach ache, among other things, although such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of bias. Like many alternative medicines, it may benefit from a placebo effect. Acupoints used in treatment may or may not be in the same area of the body as the targeted symptom. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory for the selection of such points and their effectiveness is that they work by stimulating the meridian system to bring about relief There are several different instruments for applying nonspecific pressure by rubbing, rolling, or applying pressure on the reflex zones of the body. The acuball is a small ball made of rubber with protuberances that is heatable. It is used to apply pressure and relieve muscle and joint pain. The energy roller is a small cylinder with protuberances. It is held between the hands and rolled back and forth to apply acupressure. The foot roller (also \"krupa chakra\") is a round, cylindrical roller with protuberances. It is placed on the floor and the foot is rolled back and forth over it. The power mat (also pyramid mat) is a mat with small pyramid- shaped bumps that you walk on. The spine roller is a bumpy roller containing magnets that is rolled up and down the spine. The Teishein is one of the original nine classical acupuncture needles described in the original texts of acupuncture. Even though it is described as an acupuncture needle it did not pierce the skin. It is used to apply rapid percussion pressure to the points being treated. Aromatherapy is a type of alternative medicine practice utilizing fragrant/aromatic essential oils that are derived from a wide variety of healing plants. When inhaled or applied to the skin, therapeutic-grade essential oils (also sometimes called volatile oils) have been shown to help people overcome various health problems without the need for medications. Aromatherapy is the practice of using the natural oils extracted from flowers, bark, stems, leaves, roots or other parts of a plant to enhance psychological and physical well- being. The inhaled aroma from these \"essential\" oils is widely believed to stimulate brain function. Essential oils can also be absorbed through the skin, where they travel through the bloodstream and can promote whole-body healing. A form of alternative medicine, aromatherapy is gaining momentum. It is used for a variety of applications, including pain relief, mood enhancement and increased cognitive function There are a wide number of essential oils available, each with its own healing properties. Plants contain certain beneficial chemicals as a means of protecting themselves, including to ward off insects or rodents, and to defend themselves from bacteria or viruses. The active ingredients within the oils are taken directly from high yields of medicinal plants or herbs through a process known as distillation, then mixed with alcohol to preserve their strength. The finished result is a very concentrated oily formula that can be mixed with other substances. Because they're very strong, essential oils used in aromatherapy practices are usually combined with a carrier oil, such almond, jojoba or coconut oil, before being applied directly to the skin. Aromatherapy can be performed in several different ways: Diffusing a combination of essential oils into the air (or just one single oil) Inhaling oils through the nostrils directly off of a cloth or from the bottle Receiving massage therapy utilizing oils Soaking in an oil-infused bath Rubbing oils directly onto the skin Research shows that when used at home, most people use aromatherapy oil candles, apply natural products containing oils to their skin or add oils directly to a soaking bath/warm shower. What types of plants produce popular essential oils used in aromatherapy? These include: Herbs like rosemary, thyme, oregano or peppermint Leaves from eucalyptus plants Grasses, such as lemongrass Fennel seeds Zest from fruits such as oranges, grapefruit or lemon Flowers, including rose or geranium Wood or bark from trees including cedar or pine Roots from ginger Resin from frankincense trees And many more Aromatherapy has been studied in connection with improving both short-term health problems, along with more serious disorders. Research shows that anyone with the following health conditions can likely benefit from aromatherapy: Chronic stress or anxiety Depression Insomnia and trouble sleeping Muscle pain Joint pain Respiratory infections Digestive upset PMS or menopause symptoms Skin problems or disorders, including bites, rashes, bruising, cellulite or acne Blood sugar fluctuations Cancer Fatigue A growing pool of both human and animal studies has shown that aromatherapy oils can have both sedative and stimulant effects, plus positive effects on the immune system and central nervous system. Recently, studies conducted using functional imaging scans have showed that fragrant aromatherapy oils have positive effects on the primitive region in the brain called the limbic system, which helps control both emotional responses and behaviors. The key to achieving results from aromatherapy is to use pure, therapeutic-grade oils rather than those with synthetic ingredients or fragrances. The effectiveness of aromatherapy practices always depends on the quality of the oils used, plus the dosage. Reflexology, also known as zone therapy, is an alternative medicine involving application of pressure to the feet and hands with specific thumb, finger, and hand techniques without the use of oil or lotion. It is based on a pseudoscientific system of zones and reflex areas that purportedly reflect an image of the body on the feet and hands, with the premise that such work effects a physical change to the body. Reflexology is gentle manipulation or pressing on certain parts of the foot to produce an effect elsewhere in the body Reviews from 2009 and 2011 have not found evidence sufficient to support the use of reflexology for any medical condition. A 2009 systematic review of randomized controlled trials concludes: \"The best evidence available to date does not demonstrate convincingly that reflexology is an effective treatment for any medical condition.\" In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance reflexology was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. There is no consensus among reflexologists on how reflexology is supposed to work; a unifying theme is the idea that areas on the foot correspond to areas of the body, and that by manipulating these one can improve health through one's QI Reflexologists divide the body into ten equal vertical zones, five on the right and five on the left. Concerns have been raised by medical professionals that treating potentially serious illnesses with reflexology, which has no proven efficacy, could delay the seeking of appropriate medical treatment. Reflexology's claim to manipulate energy (Qi) is unsupported by science; there is no scientific evidence for the existence of life energy (Qi), 'energy balance', 'crystalline structures,' or 'pathways' in the body.
