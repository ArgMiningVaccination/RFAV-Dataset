The Toolkit presents practicalinformation on how to ukeep ECE environments clean and safe using practices and products that are lesshazardous to health and the environment; uprotect young children and staff from infectious diseases. Group care of young children provides idealconditions for the spread of infectious disease.Children in ECE get sick more often, and arehospitalized more often when they do get sick,compared to children cared for at home. Parentsmust also take time off from work to care for sickchildren. Research shows that there are several steps that can reduce the risk of infectious disease in ECE: uDevelopment of written policies for reducing the risk of infectious disease uEducation of child care center staff about infection control practices that is repeatedon a regular basis, preferably every year when new products or policies are introduced when new employees are hired uCareful and frequent handwashing by both staff and children uAppropriate cleaning and targeted disinfection of contaminated surfaces whennecessary uSeparation of food preparation, toileting, and diaper changing activities uVaccination of children and staff Why should we change the way we clean, sanitize, and disinfect? ECE programs prevent infectious disease by using cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products. Inthe past, little thought was given to the risksposed by these products. Many people mistakenlythink that if a cleaning, sanitizing, or disinfectingproduct is sold to the public it has been reviewedand proven safe by government agencies. The U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requiresthat products labeled as sanitizers or disinfectantsdo kill the germs that the product claims to kill,but the registration review does not evaluate allpossible health risks for users of the products.Cleaning products are also not routinely reviewedby the government to identify health risks to theuser. Some manufacturers choose to have the EPAevaluate their cleaning products for human healthand environmental safety through the Design forthe Environment (DfE) Safer Product LabelingProgram, but this is voluntary and most productsare not reviewed. We are constantly learning more about the potential health problems of cleaning, sanitizing,and disinfecting products. Some of thesechemicals affect air quality and can cause ortrigger health problems such as asthma. Forexample, 11% of people with work-relatedasthma in California connected their asthma tocleaning and disinfecting products. Over half ofthese patients never had asthma before beingexposed to the products - inhaling the productscaused their asthma. Four out of the 5 peoplediagnosed with work-related asthma in this studywere bystanders. They were not working directlywith cleaning or disinfecting chemicals. Theywere simply nearby and exposed to them. 1 Introduction Because these products have risks, it is important to choose the safest products available. Manycompanies are developing new, effective productsthat contain less hazardous chemicals and aresafer. Children are more sensitive to the health effects of toxic chemicals Fetuses and very young children are particularly sensitive to the effects of toxic chemicals. Duringearly development, growth is rapid and organs,especially the brain, are developing. In the US,researchers estimate that 5% of childhood cancerand 30% of childhood asthma are related tochemical exposures. The President's Cancer Panelnoted in 2010, \"the true burden ofenvironmentally induced cancer has been grosslyunderestimated.\" Health effects from exposure to toxic chemicals may not show up for years or even decades.Unlike adults, children have many years todevelop illnesses caused by early exposures totoxic chemicals. It is important to practice the \"precautionary principle\" and protect children from potential health effects, even if some causeand effect relationships are not yet fully proven. Many new products are marketed with terms such as \"green\" to make the public think they aresafer. However, there is no legal definition ofthese terms, and when they are used on aproduct label, they do not assure that a product issafe. Fortunately, there are independentorganizations and government agencies workingto review cleaning products in order to identifyproducts that are effective and safer for humanhealth, wildlife, and the environment. This Toolkitwill help you make good choices about productsand tools to use in your program. What is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting? Cleaning is done with water, a cleaning product, and scrubbing. Cleaning does not kill bacteria,viruses, or fungi, which are generally referred toas \"germs.\" Cleaning products are used toremove germs, dirt, and other organic material by washing them down the drain. Sanitizing and disinfecting products are chemicals that work by killing germs. These chemicals are also called antimicrobial pesticides. They areregulated by the California Department ofPesticide Regulation (or similar agencies in otherstates) and the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA). Disinfectants kill more germs thansanitizers. In most cases, a cleaning product isused first. Then the surface is either sanitized ordisinfected when it is necessary. Some of the questions we hear often from ECE providers are: uWhich products should be used to clean? uWhich areas should be sanitized and which should be disinfected and howoften? What is the difference? uWhat sanitizing and disinfecting products are safe to use? uHow do we comply with child care licensing regulations? uCan disinfectants make us sicker than the diseases they are meant to prevent? uCan I use bleach safely? uIf a product says that it is \"green,\" is it safe to use? 2 WEIGHING THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF USING CHEMICALS TO CLEAN, SANITIZE, AND DISINFECT Health risks of cleaning, sanitizing and disinfection chemicalsHealth risks of infectious diseases RISK BENEFIT BALANCEIntroduction This Toolkit will help you answer these questions.

They can spread from oneperson (or animal) to another when germs leaveone body and get into another. Sometimesinfectious diseases are also called communicableor contagious diseases. Microbes that causedisease are called pathogens. Infectious diseases are common in ECE. Studies show that some young children in ECE havesymptoms of infectious illness one-third to one-half of the days in a year! There are different kinds of germs Viruses are the most common cause of illness. They are very small. Viruses can't live on surfacesfor very long. The common cold is a group ofsymptoms caused by 200 different viruses. This iswhy young children get 8-10 colds a year. Thereare always more cold viruses that they haven'thad yet! Viruses also cause intestinal andrespiratory flu. Antibiotics kill bacteria but cannotkill viruses! They should not be used to treatillnesses caused by viruses. Luckily, we get betterfrom most viral illnesses without medicaltreatment. Bacteria are more complex than viruses. They can live and reproduce independently. Some can survive on surfaces for a long time, feeding offdirt or food and water. Most are harmless or evenbeneficial to us. They help us to digest food aswell as prevent infections caused by harmfulbacteria. Common bacterial infections includesome ear infections, some cases of diarrhea, strepthroat, and urinary tract infections. Bacteria canalso cause more serious infections such astuberculosis, whooping cough, staph infections,bacterial pneumonia, and bacterial meningitis.Some bacteria - for example, methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) - have developed ways to resist antibiotics and can cause seriousinfectious diseases that are hard to treat. Bacteriaoften attach to surfaces, especially moist ones,and form dense mats called biofilm. Bacteria inbiofilms are much harder to kill. Keeping surfacesclean and dry prevents biofilms from developing. When we kill germs on a surface with a chemical disinfectant, it is important to think of this astemporary. The surface will be home to newgerms as soon as it is touched by hands, orsneezed or coughed on. Bacteria can grow anddivide very fast. They can double in number in 10minutes when they have food and water. Fungi, including yeasts and molds, are every- where. They can survive on surfaces for long periods. Fungi can cause common skin infectionssuch as: udiaper rash uthrush in infections, such as tinea capitis, and nail infections These infections are bothersome and cansometimes take months to go away, but theydon't cause serious illness in children with healthyimmune systems. They also don't spread andcause infection in the rest of the body in healthypeople. Section 1: What is infectious disease? Mold can be found anywhere there is constant moisture, like bathrooms and kitchens. You cannot \"catch\" mold from another person. Moldcan cause irritations of the eye, skin, nose, throat,and lungs, and can trigger asthma. It can producean allergic reaction in some people. The best wayto control mold indoors is to get rid of moistureand leaks. Parasites are larger than bacteria. They enter our bodies through contaminated food or by penetrating our skin. They are common indeveloping nations around the world. A fewparasites infect children in the United States. Thethree main parasites that are sometimes seen inECE are: ugiardia, which is spread by drinking water that contains the giardia parasite; the fecal-oral route, (See \"How do germs get into our bodies?\" on page 6); upinworms, which are also spread by the fecal-oral route; uscabies, which are mainly spread by skin- to-skin contact and may be transmitted byobjects. Insects, though not germs, can also spread infectious diseases. West Nile virus and Westernequine encephalitis are uncommon diseases thatdo occur in the United States and are spread bymosquito bites. Lyme disease and Babesiosis arediseases spread by tick bites. Head lice, scabies, and bed bugs bite the human body and cause skin reactions. They can spreadfrom person to person when they hitchhike fromone body to another or, in the case of bed bugs,can be carried on luggage or bedding.Fortunately, these infestations are only annoying.These insects do not carry serious diseases thatcan infect humans. Where do we find germs in our bodies? Bacteria and viruses are found in our body fluids: A good rule to remember: if it's wet and comes from someone else's body, it can be infectious. Some germs cause an infection in the upperrespiratory system (a URI). A cold is a URI. Othergerms infect the gastrointestinal system andcause vomiting and diarrhea. Some, like the flu,can cause both. These types of infectious diseasesare the most common in ECE. 5 ublood umucus usaliva (feces) uurine udischarges from the eyes and skinlesions GERMS: THE GOOD SIDE Not all microbes cause disease. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi are part of the ecosystems of our bodies. We're made up of10 times as many microbial cells as human cells! All of themicrobes in our body together weigh 3 pounds - as much asour brains! This collection of microbes is called our biome.We need our biome to survive. Microbes help maintain the health of our bodies. For example, they make vitamins ; break down tough plants so we can digest them; help to form our immune system and control inflammation. Exposure to germs in early childhood teaches our immunesystem how to tell the difference between what is harmfuland what is not. Allergies occur when the body seesordinary, harmless things like pollen as harmful. Some research even suggests that bacteria may help us maintain a healthy weight and protect us from asthma.When we kill microbes with antibiotics, we kill the goodwith the bad, which is why we should only take antibioticswhen we really need them. And we shouldn't think of allmicrobes as bad germs that need to be wiped out. Someillnesses are even treated using microbes. Probiotics ormicrobe-containing yogurt are sometimes used to replacesome of our \"good\" microbes that are destroyed byantibiotics.6Section 1: What is infectious disease? How do germs get into our bodies? Germs are spread in body fluids in the following ways: Direct contact: when body fluids are directly transferred from one person toanother. Examples of direct contact aretouching and kissing. An animal bite isanother example. Droplets: when secretions fly out of kids' (and adults') noses and mouths (when theysneeze, cough, spit, drool, slobber, orvomit) into the air and then land on a hardsurface or are inhaled by another person. uDroplets can fly only a short distance, usually 3 feet or less, but if they land onanother child's eye, nose, or mouth theycan spread disease. uGerms can also be spread when children touch droplets that land on a surface likea table and then touch their own eyes,mouth, or nose before washing theirhands. uMost of the germs that can be spread by direct contact can also be spread bydroplets. uGerms that can spread by droplets are more contagious than germs that requiredirect contact. When an infection canspread between people that are onlynear each other, the infection is morecontagious. Diseases caused by virusesand bacteria can be spread this way. uFungi and parasites are not transmitted by droplets. uGerms live longer on stainless steel, plastic, and similar hard surfaces thanthey do on fabric and other soft surfaces.Germs also live longer when the surfaceis wet and dirty. Food and water on asurface provide germs with all they needto survive and multiply! When dropletsland on a hard surface like a table or adoorknob, the viruses in those dropletscan live several hours or more. Bacteriacan live for even longer. Airborne transmission: when germs float suspended in the air attached to smalldroplets or dust particles and travel morethan 3 feet. uAirborne germs can travel across a room, down a hall, into a ventilation system, toanother floor, or even from one buildingto another where another person canbreathe in the germ. Section 1: What is infectious disease? uGerms that spread by airborne transmission are the most contagious of all. We can inhale them deep into ourlungs where they can cause more seriousillness. Disinfecting doesn't help with thespread of these kinds of illness. uLuckily, not very many germs can travel this way. Those that do are difficult tocontrol. For example, the viruses thatcause chicken pox and measles arespread by airborne routes. Nine out often unvaccinated people who breathethe air of a person infected with chickenpox or measles will get sick. Cleaning anddisinfecting will not prevent air-borneillnesses. This is why vaccination is soimportant. It is the only way to protectyourself and children from theseextremely contagious diseases. Fecal-oral transmission: when germs in stool from one infected person make theirway into the mouth of another person.These germs usually cause vomiting anddiarrhea. uThis happens most commonly when infected people don't wash their handsafter using the bathroom. When dirty hands touch food, the germs from that person's stool aretransferred to the food. When thatfood is eaten by someone else, thegerms enter their body and they canget sick. For example, a toddler touchesher dirty diaper, doesn't wash herhands, then takes crackers from ashared bowl, leaving germs on thecrackers. Other children who eat crackers from the bowl can get sick. When dirty hands touch surfaces or objects, the germs are transferredthere. When another person touchesthose same surfaces, he gets the germson his hands. If he eats or puts hishands in his eyes, nose, or mouth without washing them, the germs getinto his body and can make him sick. uInfections from animals can also be spread this way. For example, reptilesand rodents have caused Salmonellaoutbreaks in ECE programs. They alsocarry germs on their skin which can causeillness through direct contact. u Some common viruses, including Hepatitis A, Norovirus, and Rotavirus, arespread through fecal-oral routes. Theymay also be spread by droplets that areproduced when a person vomits - thismakes them very hard to prevent! u Handwashing is our best defense against germs spread by the fecal-oral route! Blood: when an infected person's blood enters another person's body through abreak in the skin. Many of the germs thatcan be found in blood can cause life-threatening disease. However, mostblood-borne infections come from infectedneedles, not from bleeding knees on theplayground. 7 8Section 1: What is infectious disease? uLuckily, infections from blood-borne germs are easily prevented by: teaching children not to touch blood and to tell an adult when there is an injury that involves blood. educating staff about how to handle blood using standard precautions (SeeSection 11 for information on cleaningup a blood spill). u If children and staff know their jobs when it comes to blood, they canprevent the transmission of infectiousdiseases through blood in ECE. Insect bites: when an insect transmits bacteria and viruses to humans through their bites. West Nile virus is a disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes, which are insects. Why do some people get sick while others do not? Whether or not a person is affected by germsdepends on several factors: uHow many germs they are exposed to and how powerful (virulent) the germs are. If a person is exposed to many powerful germs,they are more likely to get sick. uTheir general health. If someone is generally healthy and eating and sleepingwell, their immune system will functionbetter than the immune system ofsomeone who has other health problems,eats poorly, and doesn't get enough sleep. uWhether they are immune to the germ. If someone has an illness, they developantibodies to it. When they are exposed tothe germ again, their body's antibodiesrecognize the microbe and destroy it andthey do not get sick. This is how vaccineswork, too. Vaccines give your body a smalldose of a germ so you can developantibodies.Why are ECE programs the perfect environment for the spread of infectiousdiseases? u Children in ECE spend their days in groups, which means there is a large pool of germs to share; the transfer of germs from one child to many others is easier and faster because they are in close contact with each other. u Young children touch each other and hard surfaces more than older children or adults,and then put their fingers in their mouths,eyes, or nose. u Young children don't yet have good personal hygiene skills. They cough, sneeze, drool and chew on each other and their toys. They are in diapers or the early stages of toilet learning and often have accidents. Touching fecal matter and then the mouth (the fecal-oral route) is a common way to transfer germs thatcause gastrointestinal disease. They don't wash their hands unless an adult tells them to or does it for them. 9Section 1: What is infectious disease? Schools and child care centers have been found to be one of the main causes of the spread of diseases like the flu to the rest of the community. How are infectious diseases treated? Viral infections like the common cold or stomachvirus infections are not usually treated withmedications. Treatment for these infections issupportive care (rest, fluids, and time). Commonviral infections cannot be completely prevented.As a result, the average preschool age child gets 8-10 colds a year. Infants and toddlers may getmore. Some bacterial infections, like some earand skin infections, are treated with antibiotics.Some infections can be prevented with vaccines. We can also reduce the spread of germs by our personal behaviors u Handwashing with plain (not antibacterial) soap and water is one of the most important ways that we can prevent the spread of germs. Children are not the only ones who spread germs. Teachers and parents also spread germs on their hands. u Children and staff staying home when they are ill keeps germs at home, too. u Covering our coughs and sneezing into our sleeves lowers the number of germs that we send out into the environment. Germs get caught in our clothing instead, where they don't live very long!Read on! This Toolkit will help you better understand all the ways that we can reduce thespread of infectious diseases in ECE. One last thought on the role of infectious disease in health While it seems like preventing as much infectious disease as possible in ECE is a good thing, newresearch shows that many of our chronic healthconditions may be caused by growing up in overlyclean environments. Science is telling us thatexposure to germs and the infectious diseasesthey cause may contribute to a better functioningimmune system. For example, children who growup on a farm are less likely to have asthmabecause they are exposed to a wide range ofgerms when they are young. There has been asharp rise in allergies, asthma, and asthma-relateddeaths in developed countries in the last 30 years.Many scientists argue that part of the cause isthat the immune system of young children is notstimulated enough by exposure to germs.Research also indicates that exposure to commoninfections early in life may be protective againstchildhood leukemia. We still don't know thewhole story of how exposure to germs affects ourimmune system, but there is a connection. Remember, too, that when young children get sick from exposure to germs in ECE, they will notget as sick when they enter elementary school.This is because they have already developedantibodies to many of the germs they come intocontact with in school. It is important to keep this new science in mind when we weigh the risks of using hazardouschemicals to keep ECE environments as germ-freeas possible. Exposure to these chemicals maycause illness, and notgetting sick from common infections in childhood may also have risks. 10Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Section 2:Why is it important to clean in ECE? Why do we clean? This seems like a silly question, but it is helpful to think about what weaccomplish when we clean. Children are more vulnerable Care of the physical environment is especiallyimportant when caring for young children. Theyare exposed to more germs and toxic chemicals(for their size) than adults for the followingreasons: uChildren breathe 4 to 6 times more air than adults, and they breathe close to theground where pollutants in air tend toconcentrate. u Children have more skin covering their bodies relative to their weight than adults. u Children have more skin contact with the floor because of their size and behavior.This means they can absorb more pollutantsthat concentrate on the floor through theirskin. u Children eat more food per pound of body weight than adults. They are also morevulnerable to food borne illnesses. u Children's hand to mouth behavior means they eat more dust than adults. Dustcontains many toxic chemicals fromcleaning products, pesticides, furnishings,and other sources. u Mouthing objects is more common in young children. Young children are also still developing and haveimmature bodies. Their bodies are less able to getrid of toxic substances than adults. Theirdeveloping organs, especially their brains, can beaffected by exposure to toxic substances. This canaffect their growth and their ability to learn andfunction. So conditions which allow germs, pests,chemicals, dirt, dust, and moisture to build up inthe ECE environment can cause more healthproblems for young children than for the adultswho are caring for them. More reasons to clean in ECE uChildren and staff feel better, both physically and psychologically, when theenvironment is cared for and clean. u Research shows that when schools improve their physical environments, children learnbetter and feel better about themselvesand their school. They feel cared for. 11Section 2: Why is it important to clean in ECE? u Research shows that teachers are more satisfied with their jobs when the environment is clean and well-maintained. u Cleaning removes allergens and irritants that can cause or trigger asthma. u Getting rid of clutter makes it easier to focus on tasks. It also gets rid of hidingplaces for pests like rodents andcockroaches. This reduces the need forpesticides which may have their ownharmful health and environmental effects.It also makes it easier to clean and controldust. Dust contains pollutants that cantrigger allergies and asthma, and toxicchemicals that can cause illness. u The presence of moisture, standing water, and mold can cause respiratory problemsand allergies. Keeping the indoorenvironment clean and dry can reduce moldand respiratory illnesses. It also reduces theuse of disinfectants, called fungicides, thatare used to get rid of mold after itdevelops. u Cleaning, sanitizing, and targeted disinfection where required, can helpreduce the spread of infectious disease.Cleaning helps reduce the number ofinfectious diseases that are passed aroundin an ECE program by: washing some germs down the drain; removing dirt and organic matter that can reduce the effectiveness of sanitizersand disinfectants. u Respiratory illnesses such as colds, flu, and asthma are the most common reasonchildren are absent from ECE. Whenchildren are absent from ECE, their learningsuffers and their parents often miss work.Young children are also affected when theirteachers or caregivers are absent due toillness. Preschool is also a critical time for children toform important health and hygiene habits. Whenyou teach children the importance of personalhygiene, and how to keep their environmentsclean, you help them to establish healthy habitsthat last a lifetime. 12Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Section 3:What are the health hazards of cleaners, sanitizers, and disinfectants? Cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products play an important role in ECE. However, some cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products also contain chemicals thatmay cause health problems in children and staff.They may also cause problems in the environmentfor our waterways and wildlife. Understandingthe health risks of these products can help you uchoose them carefully; u use them more safely and only when and where they are needed. Many people think that any cleaning, sanitizing,or disinfecting product that is sold must be safe.This is not true. u American Poison Control Centers report that household cleaning products anddisinfectants are common causes ofpoisoning in both children and adults. u We don't know much about the long-term health effects of many of these products.These health effects don't show up formonths or years. Awareness of the long-term effects is important for young childrenbecause they have so many years in whichto develop health problems from earlyexposures. Therefore, it makes sense tolimit children's exposure to chemicals whenwe don't know for certain what effects theymay have in the long term. Government regulations require only limited labeling of cleaning products Only the active ingredient chemicals in sanitizers, disinfectants, and fungicides that kill bacteria,viruses, or mold have to be listed on the productlabel. Manufacturers are not required to list all ofthe ingredients on cleaning product labels. Wordssuch as \"natural,\" \"non-toxic,\" and \"green\" thatappear on cleaning product labels are poorlyregulated by the government. While the FederalTrade Commission has guidelines formanufacturers who use these terms, they arerarely enforced. Researchers have found thatcleaning products labeled with these terms oftenhave as many hazardous chemicals asconventional cleaning products. These gaps ininformation on cleaning product labels make itdifficult for the consumer to make wise choiceswhen purchasing cleaning products. More than 85,000 commercial chemicals have been developed in the last 60 years. When health testing is done, it is normally done on a single chemical. However, we are usually exposed to a mixture of chemicals. Scientists do not understand the effects of being exposed to mixtures of chemicals. Acute and chronic health effects When we use cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfectingchemicals, we can breathe them into our lungs andabsorb them through our skin. When thesechemicals affect our health right away it is calledan acute effect, such as an asthma attack. Butsome chemicals get stored in our bodies or we areexposed to small amounts repeatedly over a longtime. This chronic exposure can cause cancer orother diseases, such as asthma, years later. Theseare long-term or chronic health effects. Chemicalsalso make their way into air and dust and continueto expose children and staff over time. Forexample, a study of ECE facilities found residues indust of a dangerous pesticide that had beenbanned for many years. Dust gets on children'shands and into their bodies. Section 3: What are the health hazards of cleaners, sanitizers, and disinfectants? When chemicals are used to clean, sanitize, and disinfect, children and staff can be exposed tohealth risks because uthe chemicals in the product are hazardous; uthe product is used in a way (such as not following the label directions) thatincreases exposures to the chemicals. Potentially harmful exposures from theseproducts also depend on: uThe product's physical characteristics Is it an aerosol (a fine spray that can be breathed deep into the lungs)? Does it evaporate into the air easily where we breathe it? uThe characteristics of the building environment Is the ventilation system the right size and in working order? What is the size of the room? Do the windows and doors open?WHAT IS ASTHMA? Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in the lungs that results in the following symptoms: Over 350 substances are known to cause asthma in people who have never had asthma before. Most of them cause asthma through a process called sensitization. Smallexposures over time can cause asthma, even to adults. Asthma can also be caused by a single high exposure to an irritating chemical. This type of asthma is calledReactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS). Once a person has asthma, exposure to many \"triggers,\" such as irritating chemicals, animal dander, cold air,tobacco smoke, and exercise can cause an episode ofasthma. Many cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products contain chemicals that can both cause and trigger asthma. Symptoms of asthma can usually be controlled with a variety of drugs, but there is no known cure. More people have asthma now than ever before. Almost 19 million Americans, including 7 million children, haveasthma. That is nearly 1 in 10 children. Children under 5 years old have the most hospitalizations and emergency room visits for asthma. 13 wheezing coughingchest tightness trouble breathing Normal airway Asthma airway Airway during an Asthma attackAirway Air trapped in alveoli Tightened smooth musclesRelaxedsmooth muscles Wall inflamed and thickenedLungs SYMPTOMS ofASTHMASection 3: What are the health hazards of cleaners, sanitizers, and disinfectants? Some common chemicals and their effects uAmmonia and bleach (sodium hypochlorite) cause asthma in workers who breathe too much of it in their jobs. They can triggerasthma attacks in children or ECE providerswho already have asthma. They can alsoirritate the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. uQuaternary ammonium compounds (also known as QUATs, QACs, or QATs) are notvolatile compounds, but using them assprays can cause nose and throat irritation.Benzalkonium chloride is a severe eyeirritant and causes and triggers asthma.Exposures to QUATs may cause allergic skinreactions. Use of QUATs has been associatedwith the growth of bacteria that areresistant to disinfection. Sometimes thisresistance also transfers to antibiotics. Inlaboratory studies, QUATs were found todamage genetic material (genes). uTriclosan is a suspected endocrine disruptor (see What are Endocrine Disrupters?) andmay lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. uPhthalates are used in fragrances that are found in air fresheners and cleaning andsanitizing products. They are endocrinedisruptors. Research indicates thatphthalates increase the risk of allergies andasthma and can affect children'sneurodevelopment and thyroid function.Studies show links between phthalates inmothers to abnormal genital developmentin boys. Phthalates have been found inhuman urine, blood, semen, amniotic fluid,and breast milk. uVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals that vaporize at roomtemperature. Many VOCs that are releasedby cleaning supplies have been linked tochronic respiratory problems such asasthma, allergic reactions, and headaches. WHAT ARE ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS? Hormones are substances that are produced by our endocrine system. In very, very small amounts hormones control growth, reproduction, metabolism, development, behavior, sleep functions, immune function, and stress. These are allfunctions that are critical for life. These functions are controlled by hormonal messages sent by the endocrine system. Hormones also play a role in many diseases, including diabetes and cancer. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that interrupt orimitate those natural hormonal messages. Since hormones work at very small doses, endocrine disrupting chemicals can also affect health in very small amounts. According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, endocrine disruptors may cause reducedfertility in women and men, early puberty in girls, andincreases in cancers of the breast, ovaries, and prostate. A 2013 report from the World Health Organization reports that evidence linking hormone-mimicking chemicals tohuman health problems has grown stronger over the pastdecade, becoming a \"global threat\" that should beaddressed. 14Phthalates are endocrine disruptors. They are used in fragrances that are found in air fresheners and cleaningand sanitizing products. Section 3: What are the health hazards of cleaners, sanitizers, and disinfectants? Fragrances are mixtures of many chemicals, including VOCs. They can contain up to 3,000 separate ingredients.There is no requirement that fragranceingredients be listed on the product label.Many of these chemicals: can trigger asthma and allergies; may be hazardous to humans. (See Section 8 for more information on fragrances.) Terpenes are chemicals found in pine, lemon, and orange oils that are used inmany cleaning and disinfecting productsas well as in fragrances. Terpenes reactwith ozone, especially on hot smoggydays, forming very small particles like those found in smog and haze that can irritate the lungs and may cause other health problems formaldehyde which causes cancer, is a sensitizer that is linked to asthma and allergic reactions, has damaged genes in lab tests, is a central nervous system depressant (slows down brain activity), may cause joint pain, depression, headaches, chest pains, ear infections,chronic fatigue, dizziness, and loss ofsleep. Improper use of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting chemicals can increaseexposure and health risks Each year about 6 out of every 100 professional custodians are injured by the chemicals they useto clean, sanitize, and disinfect. Burns to the eyesand skin are the most common injuries, followedclosely by breathing toxic mists or vapors. 15 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM hypothalamus pituitary gland thyroid glands, (female) of endocrine glands, metabolism,* regeneration.

Many of these injuries are due to improper use of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products.For example, many chemicals used for cleaning,sanitizing, and disinfecting come in aconcentrated form. To be used, they have to becorrectly diluted with water: u When diluting concentrated products unsafely, the user increases her exposure tothe health hazards of the product. She isexposed by breathing the fumes of theconcentrated product into her lungs orabsorbing the liquid through her skin. uIf the wrong chemicals are mixed together, they can react to form a toxic gas and thehealth effects can be much worse. Forexample, when bleach is mixed withammonia or quaternary ammoniumcompounds (found in some disinfectants),chloramine gas is created, which is highlytoxic. u If a chemical is too concentrated (the user doesn't add the amount of water indicatedon the product label), then the healtheffects of using that product are increased.They are increased for the person who isusing the product. They are also increasedfor the people who occupy the indoor spacewhere it is used, especially children. u It is important to follow dilution instructions carefully to avoid harm to theperson doing the diluting, as well as to thechildren and staff in the building. Personalprotective equipment such as gloves andgoggles, when indicated on the productlabel, should be worn while working withconcentrated chemicals. Better yet, avoidusing products that require personalprotective equipment! Aerosols Use of spray bottles, aerosol cans, and machinessuch as carpet washers create a fine mist(aerosolization) of the cleaning product,increasing the amount of chemical suspended inthe air. These suspended chemicals causeproblems with breathing such as asthma. Thesmall particles created by aerosolization can getdeeper into the lung. These products shouldnever be used around children. Using cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfection products without good ventilation When an ECE building does not have a good ventilation system, or doors and windows are notopened while cleaning, the concentration ofchemicals in indoor air increases; so do the healtheffects of those chemicals. It is important to makesure that your ventilation system is workingproperly in order to reduce the concentration ofchemicals in indoor air from cleaners, sanitizers,and disinfectants and other sources. (For moreinformation, see Fact Sheet: What is Indoor Air Quality?) How do we prevent these health hazards? Choosing less hazardous cleaning, sanitizing, anddisinfecting products can reduce harmful healtheffects for children, ECE staff, and custodialworkers. It is also better for the environment.There are also many non-chemical strategies forcleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting that are lessharmful to the user and to ECE staff and children.See Section 6 to learn about these alternative\"best practices\" and Section 7 for information onhow to purchase safer products. 16 Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Section 4:Effects of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products on the environment Cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in ECE reduces the risk of infectious disease and removesallergens and irritants that cause or triggerasthma and allergies. But many cleaners,sanitizers, disinfectants, and fragrances, eventhose marketed as \"green\", can pollute the air,water, and soil. These products are washed down the drains of our child care facilities, schools, homes, andworkplaces. They make their way in wastewaterto the treatment plant where waste water istreated. During the treatment, sewage isseparated into treated wastewater and sludge.Treated water is then discharged into our groundwater, rivers, lakes, and oceans. Many of thesewaterways supply drinking water to ourcommunities. The problem is that wastewatertreatment plants were not designed to removethese chemicals. It is important to think twicebefore washing or flushing anything down thedrain that can harm the environment. Choosingthe products you use in your indoor environmentscarefully can help protect the environment aswell as your health. Below we describe twoexamples of products that are harmful to theenvironment. Triclosan in the environment Triclosan and its relative triclocarban areantimicrobial chemicals that slow or stop thegrowth of bacteria, fungi, and mildew. They arefound in antibacterial soaps, deodorants,sponges, and household cleaners anddisinfectants. Over 1 million pounds of triclosanand triclocarban are disposed of in theenvironment every year. The transport of triclosan to wastewatertreatment plants occurs when people uwash hands soap; uhand-wash dishes with antibacterial dish soap; uuse personal care products such as toothpaste that contain triclosan; uuse products like cutting boards that contain triclosan. As a result, triclosan ends up in our drains,sewage systems, and eventually our waterways. Italso gets concentrated in the sludge created inwastewater treatment plants. Over 400,000pounds of triclosan and triclocarban are spreadon agricultural fields in the U.S. every year whenthis waste treatment sludge is recycled as\"fertilizer.\" Scientists are concerned that plantsthat grow in the soil contaminated with triclosanfrom sludge will absorb the triclosan. Inexperiments, researchers have found triclosan incarrots, pumpkins, and zucchini - foods that arenormally good for children. Triclosan is also foundin lakes, rivers, ocean coastal waters, domesticand drinking water, soils, indoor dust, fish andother aquatic animals, and humans. Eating fishand fruits and vegetables that contain triclosan isanother way humans may be exposed. Researchshows triclosan is present in human urine, blood,and breast milk. Sometimes the risks of using a chemical are balanced by the benefits. But the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) says that triclosan is nomore effective at killing germs than washing wellwith soap and water. According to the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), vigoroushandwashing in warm water with plain soap forat least 20 seconds is sufficient to fight germs inmost cases. When soap and water are notavailable, use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizerproduct is a better option than soap that containstriclosan. 17 Section 4: Effects of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products on the environment Many authorities, including the American Medical Association (AMA), now recommend thattriclosan should not be used in consumerproducts. The health and environmental risks oftriclosan are not worth the very limited benefits. Fragrances in the environment Fragrances are chemicals that are in mostcleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products.They ureact with sunlight to contribute to smog formation in indoor and outdoor air; umay affect water quality when they are used in liquid products like cleaning andpersonal care products. Like triclosan, many fragrance chemicals are notfiltered out by water treatment. What goes downthe drain ends up in our drinking water and inour lakes, streams, rivers, and bays. Thesecompounds ubreak down slowly in the environment; uare found in the water supply, leading to high levels in nearly all fish, shellfish, andother aquatic wildlife; uare concentrated in larger animals when larger fish and other wildlife eatcontaminated aquatic wildlife. From there,these pollutants travel up the food chain tohuman beings. For more information on fragrances, seeSection 6. 18 Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Section 5:What is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting and how do these tasks help control infectious disease in ECE? Before choosing a cleaning or antimicrobial product, you will first need to decide whether thesurface needs to be cleaned, sanitized, ordisinfected. In most cases, you will need to clean asurface before you sanitize or disinfect. But itdoesn't make sense to disinfect something thatonly needs to be cleaned. The products used todisinfect are more toxic and/or more expensivethan products used just to clean. Overusingantimicrobial products like sanitizers anddisinfectants may also lead to the spread of\"superbugs.\" Superbugs are germs that are noteasily killed by disinfectants and/or antibiotics. The CDC provides the following guidance on the differences between cleaning, sanitizing, anddisinfecting. Cleaning uReduces germs, dirt, and impurities by removing them from surfaces or objects. Dirt and organic material make somedisinfectants less effective, so cleaning isnecessary before disinfecting in most cases. uWorks by using soap or detergent and water to physically remove germs fromsurfaces. This process does not necessarilykill germs. uLowers the risk of spreading infection by washing germs down the drain. uHas been shown to remove up to 98% of bacteria and 93% of viruses from surfacesusing microfiber and water in testspublished by the EPA. uRemoves the food and water that allow germs to survive and reproduce. uRemoves dust, molds, irritants, and allergens that can trigger asthmasymptoms. Sanitizing Sanitizing is the use of a chemical product ordevice (like a dishwasher or a steam mop) thatreduces the number of germs on surfaces orobjects to a level considered safe by public healthstandards or requirements. Sanitizing kills mostgerms but not all of them. uFor food service, a sanitizer should reduce the number of germs on a surface by99.999% within 30 seconds. uFor hard surfaces not used for food service the level should be at least 99.9%. uSanitizing products should state on their label the surfaces they are intended to beused on. u Sanitizing does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. Most sanitizers,as well as disinfectants, require a clean surface in order to be effective at killinggerms. Sanitizing in child care is required for specificareas, such as food preparation and contactsurfaces, and mouthed toys and pacifiers. Forguidelines on when and where to clean, sanitize,and disinfect, see state child care regulations andAppendix 5: The Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety PerformanceStandards, Routine Schedule for Cleaning,Sanitizing, and Disinfecting. 19 Section 5: What is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting and how do these tasks help control infectious disease in ECE? Disinfecting Disinfecting uses chemicals to kill 99.999% of germs on hard, non-porous surfaces or objects.Disinfecting udoes not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs; ukills germs on contact (when the disinfectant sits visibly wet, or \"dwells,\" onthe surface for a specified length of time)after the surface has been cleaned; uonly works on hard, nonporous surfaces. Carpets and upholstery and other poroussurfaces cannot be sanitized or disinfectedwith a chemical product; uis temporary! As soon as a surface has been touched or coughed, sneezed or breathedon, germs start growing on it again. Some germs are very hard to kill, while others areeasily killed by many disinfectants, and even plainsoap. Disinfectants are antimicrobial pesticides and must be registered with the U.S. EPA and theCalifornia Department of Pesticide Regulation(DPR) or similar agencies in other states. Some devices can be used to disinfect; for example machines that apply steam to surfaces.These devices are very effective, work quickly, anduse no chemicals. Some are mops and others looklike a canister vacuum with attachments for useon different surfaces. They can also disinfectsurfaces that chemical disinfectants cannot, suchas upholstery and carpets. Dust mites that live inthese surfaces are also eliminated by thesedevices. Because disinfectants are pesticides designed to kill or inactivate germs, you should make sure youneed them for the specific task. The overuse andmisuse of these products is a growing publichealth and environmental concern. Studies havefound that the use of some disinfectant productsis creating microbes that can mutate into formsthat are resistant to particular disinfectants orthat become superbugs. These resistant germs arealso harder to kill with antibiotics. Incorrectly using a disinfectant may kill theweaker germs, but the more resistant germssurvive. Incorrect use includes udisinfecting a dirty surface; uwiping or rinsing the disinfectant off the surface before the recommended dwell(contact) time is over; unot using the recommended dilution ratio (not concentrated enough); uusing a combination disinfectant/cleaner without first removing visible dirt from thesurface. 20The U.S. EPA regulates sanitizers anddisinfectants as pesticides. The U.S. Food andDrug Administration (FDA) regulatessanitizers used on food contact surfaces.Sanitizing and disinfecting require the use of EPA-registered chemical sanitizers and disinfectants; disinfecting/sanitizing water-based devices (for example, those that use steam). A pesticide is any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing,destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest.We think of pesticides when we think ofgetting rid of ants or cockroaches, but germsare also pests and the products used to killthem are pesticides. Section 5: What is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting and how do these tasks help control infectious disease in ECE? When deciding on what products to use on a surface, there are several factors to consider: Whether the surface is porous or nonporous. uManufacturers design their antimicrobial products - and the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) registers them -on the basis of the surfaces they aremeant to be used on and what thesurfaces are used for (for example, foodpreparation). u Different types of surfaces require different types of products and methodsfor removing or killing germs. Whether it is likely that the surface is touched by many people and will come incontact with broken skin or mucousmembranes. These surfaces will requiredisinfection. If a surface is contaminatedwith germs but no one is touching it, itdoesn't need to be disinfected. It is best toavoid unnecessary use of chemicals in thatarea. Whether the surface requires usanitizing which removes most germs to the level of 99.9% or more on non-foodcontact surfaces; udisinfecting (to kill virtually everything). Remember, some infectious diseases are spread inthe air. Disinfecting surfaces will not prevent thespread of these diseases! The only way to preventthe spread of airborne diseases is by ourbehaviors. See Section 6 on non-chemicalstrategies for reducing the spread of infectiousdisease. What are the recommendations and requirements for sanitizing anddisinfecting? There are typically two levels of sanitizing and disinfecting in an ECE facility: Routine sanitizing and disinfecting: This level is used for those areas that needsanitizing and disinfecting on a regularbasis (after proper cleaning with a high-quality microfiber cloth and an all-purposedetergent). Areas requiring routine sanitizing: Food contact surfaces (surfaces where food is served, stored, or prepared) Areas needing routine disinfection: Surfaces and items that are regulated by state child care licensing require-ments, such as changing tables andbathroom sinks and toilets. High-touch areas that are at high risk for collecting lots of germs, like door-knobs, bathroom faucets, and drinkingfountains. The national qualitystandards for healthand safety in childcare are contained inthe book Caring for Our Children (CFOC), by the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics,the American Public Health Association, and theNational Resource Center for Health and Safety inChild Care and Early Education. It is availableonline at http://nrckids.org/CFOC3/ and includes a table of recommendations for which areas in ECEfacilities require cleaning, sanitizing, ordisinfection and how often. See Appendix D:Model Center Policy on What, Where and howoften to Clean, Sanitize, and Disinfect in ECE on page 58 for a copy of these recommendations. 21 Section 5: What is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting and how do these tasks help control infectious disease in ECE? Routine sanitizing and disinfection are also required by state child care regulations. Forexample, in California, the most populous state,the California Child Care Licensing regulationsmandate sanitizing and disinfecting in child carefacilities to reduce the risk of infectious diseases.For information on regulations in other states,see http://nrckids.org/STATES/states.htm. The chart below provides the sanitizing and disinfectingrequirements for California child care centers'infant and toddler classrooms, as well asrecommendations from Caring for Our Children (CFOC). For the complete list of CFOC recommendations, see Appendix D: Model Center Policy on What, Where and how often to Clean,Sanitize, and Disinfect in ECE on page 58. 22Surface CA Child Care Licensing Required Frequency Caring for Our Children Recommendation Frequency Diaper changing areas General Infants Dishes, utensils, cupsPotty training chairs Disposable diaper containerDisinfect Disinfect DisinfectDisinfect Sanitize Sanitize SanitizeSanitize Clean CleanAfter each use Weekly, or if soiled or wet Daily, or if soiled or wetWeekly,monthly, or before use by another child Weekly,monthly, or before use by another childAfter each use After each useDaily DailyAfter each use After each use After each useDisinfect Disinfect INFANT/TODDLER CLASSROOMS NAPPING EQUIPMENT ALL CLASSROOMSSanitizing and disinfecting requirements and recommendations comparison chartSection 5: What is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting and how do these tasks help control infectious disease in ECE? Disinfection for incidents and outbreaks. In addition to routine sanitizing and disinfecting the following incidents andoutbreaks require increased sanitizing anddisinfecting: Outbreaks of contagious disease, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus (MRSA), influenza, and otherinfectious diseases. For outbreaks,increased disinfection of high-touchareas is appropriate. For guidance onspecific disease outbreaks, go to the CDCwebsite. Information on reducing thespread of flu in ECE can be found athttp://www.cdc.gov/flu/school/index.htm. Incidents involving blood and body fluids, such as fights, nosebleeds, and ac-cidents on the playground. See Section 11 for information on cleaning upbody fluids spills. Incidents involving feces, vomit, and saliva, such as in toileting areas in preschool. See Section 11 for information on cleaning up body fluidsspills. For areas not mentioned in the Caring for Our Children recommendations or your state regulations, consider whether the area is a high-touch area. Is it a surface touched by manychildren and caregivers during the day? If so, it isa surface that needs to be cleaned and may needto be sanitized or disinfected, especially whenthere is an outbreak of infectious disease in thefacility. It is important to know the differences between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting and whatsurfaces require what degree of cleanliness,because you only want to use the least hazardousproducts and methods that are necessary for thetask. 23 Identify high-touch surfaces in your facility. They will require more frequent cleaning and sometimes disinfectingduring a disease outbreak.Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Section 6:Personal practices for reducing the spread of infectious disease in ECE Although microbes are everywhere, most are harmless and many are helpful. Only 1% ofmicrobes cause disease. The goal of an infection-control program is to reduce the spread ofinfectious disease by reducing contact withpathogenic (disease-causing) germs or microbes.This curriculum provides guidelines on choosingsafer chemical products to clean, sanitize, anddisinfect, but it is very important to rememberthat some of the most effective ways of reducing the spread of infectious disease are found in ourpersonal behaviors. Disinfection should be called \"temporary disinfection\" because germs start to grow ondisinfected and sanitized surfaces as soon as youtouch them again. By washing your handsfrequently, you reduce the number of germs thatyou pick up from and leave on the surfaces andpeople that you touch. You are also less likely totransfer those germs to your nose, eyes, andmouth, where they can get into your body andcause infection and illness. According to the CDC, handwashing is the single most important thing you can do to reduce thespread of infectious disease in ECE as well as athome. If you focus on disinfecting but you don'twash your hands and practice good personalhygiene, you will continue to spread disease. Youneed to take personal responsibility forprotecting the young children in your care frominfectious disease. Research has shown thatcaregiver hands in ECE harbor more germs thanalmost any other surface. Caregivers changediapers, assist children with toileting, wipe noses,hold hands, handle mouthed toys, and more.Frequent handwashing is the only way to stop thecircle of infection caused by caregivers' hands. ECE providers need to be involved in efforts to improve handwashing in ECE. By making handwashing a responsibility of staff as a whole,hospitals have found improvements in handwashing rates. When ECE staff membersimplement handwashing, and other behavioralstrategies described below for themselves as wellas for the children in their care, infectious diseaserisk will be reduced. Handwashing also preventsthe transfer of toxic chemicals from children'shands to their mouths. Studies show that childrenswallow more chemicals from the skin on theirhands than from mouthing toxic productsdirectly. Hand sanitizers only kill bacteria. They donot remove toxic chemicals One of the most important lessons you can teach children in ECE is personal hygiene. This includeshandwashing, blowing noses or sneezing into atissue, and/or coughing or sneezing into ourelbow. Making these behaviors automatic for apreschool child sets the stage for the child'slifelong use of healthy habits. Preschool childrenare eager to master routines and skills. An ECEprogram is an ideal place to begin shapingchildren's health habits, routines, and practices.For many children, it is the only place where theywill learn these skills. Incorporating these habitsinto the curriculum and daily routine of theprogram helps to prevent the spread of infectiousdisease. (See Fact Sheet: Handwashing for tips on handwashing.) 24 Section 6: Personal practices for reducing the spread of infectious disease in ECE Behavioral strategies that can reduce the spread of infectious disease Cough and sneeze etiquette uCover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue away after use and wash your hands with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. If a tissue is not available, cover your mouth and nosewith your sleeve,not your hand. u Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.The skin that lines your eyes,nose, and mouth is called your mucousmembranes. Germs can make their wayinto the body through mucousmembranes, so keeping your hands awayfrom your face keeps germs fromentering your mucous membranes andhelps to keep you from getting sick. Isolation/social distancing u Stay home if you are sick. Don't risk passing your germs on to others at yourprogram. Go to the CDC websitehttp://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html for the latest information when there isan infectious disease outbreak. They willprovide information on how to deal withspecial disease outbreaks like H1N1,including how long you should stayhome before returning to work. u Encourage children and staff who are coughing or sneezing to leave a 3-6 footbuffer between themselves and others. Vaccinations Next to hand washing, vaccinations are the best way to protect against infectious disease, according to the CDC. States require certain immunizations for infectious disease before children can attend ECE. Each center should know what immunizations are required in their state. The publication Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety PerformanceStandards recommends (and child care licensing regulations in most states require)that child care facilities maintaindocumentation of the immunizations thechildren in attendance have received.Immunizations are particularly importantfor children in ECE programs because theyare at higher risk of complications frominfectious disease due to their immatureimmune systems. Vaccinations are alsorecommended for caregivers, teachers, andother staff members. Check your state'schild care guidelines for required andrecommended vaccinations. Forrecommendations on adult vaccinations,see the CDC website athttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/adult.html The CDC suggests that everyone 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine.Remember, it takes about 2 weeks aftervaccination for your body to develop animmune response. Equipment Certain pieces of equipment can aid in reducing the transmission of infectiousdisease by reducing the number of hightouch areas where microbes may be spreador by increasing air flow from theventilation system in an ECE facility. 25 Section 6: Personal practices for reducing the spread of infectious disease in ECE u No-touch bathroom facilities are available as self-flushing toilets and faucets that turn on and offautomatically. Automatic flushers can beadded to most existing toilets. Hands-free faucets that use a sensor to turn thewater on and off are also available atmost home improvement stores. u Disposal equipment such as diaper pails and garbage cans should have a tight-fitting lid that can be opened with a footpedal so that ECE staff are not touchingplaces where microbes might live andmultiply. u Separate equipment for food preparation, diaper-changing, andtoddler handwashing. Keeping these activities physically separate helps reducethe risk of spreading germs from oneactivity to another. u Impermeable, seamless surfaces for use in food preparation, diaper-changing,and handwashing. Surfaces that areporous, cracked, or damaged increasethe likelihood that germs will escapedisinfection and allow transmission,especially when people touch thesesurfaces frequently. Ventilation Ventilation is the exchange of fresh air within a building. Increasing the amount of fresh air within a building and removing indoor air containing germs that arespread through the air can also reduce therisk of infectious disease. u Mechanical ventilation is usually known as a central heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. If you havean HVAC system in your facility, makesure it is inspected and serviced on ayearly basis and that the air filters arechanged regularly. u Passive ventilation is the air that comes in from opening and closing doors orwindows. This source of air is alsoaffected by the wind and conditionsoutside. You can increase the amount ofair brought in and removed from a roomby putting an exhaust fan in a windowon one side of a room or building, andopening a window on the opposite sideto pull in air, move it across the space,and exhaust (remove) it to the outside.Make sure you are not bringing in airfrom an area where vehicles are idling. Air filtering and cleaning equipment This equipment can filter or kill germs andfilter pollutants from cleaning anddisinfectant products out of the air. Someair cleaning devices are designed to beinstalled in the ductwork of an HVACsystem to clean the air in the wholebuilding. You can also buy portable roomair cleaners to clean the air in a singleroom or specific areas. There are severalprocesses available: u Air filtering. To filter out germs such as viruses, which are very tiny, requires afilter that has a high-efficiencyparticulate air (HEPA) rating. Theseshould be properly sized for the room. u Air cleaning. Some equipment will kill germs, but is not appropriate for use in achild care setting (such as ultravioletlight) or are not safe (such as devices thatclean air but also create ozone, apollutant). Purchase an air cleaner on theCalifornia Environmental ProtectionAgency Air Resources Board list ofcertified air cleaning devices available athttp://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/aircleaners/certified.htm or the EPA Guide to Air Cleaners in the Home available at:http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/airclean.html. 26Section 6: Personal practices for reducing the spread of infectious disease in ECE Hand sanitizers Many people use hand sanitizers instead of soap and water when washing their hands.Hands should always be washed with soapand water when possible because sanitizersdon't remove dirt, and germs can hide under the dirt and remain on the hands.When you can't wash your hands, the CDCrecommends using an alcohol-based handsanitizer containing more than 60% alcohol.Children are at greater risk of harm fromhand sanitizers because they can lick theresidue off their hands and ingest theingredients in the sanitizer. 27 Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Section 7:Choosing safer products for cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting Using the least hazardous and most effective products available will protect the health of thechildren in your care, ECE staff, the custodialpersonnel, and other building occupants. Usingthese products is also better for the environment. Third-party certifiers: A way to identify safer cleaning products Organizations that evaluate products using science-based criteria for health andenvironmental impacts are called third-partycertifiers. They help us identify less hazardouscleaning products and publish lists of theproducts they have evaluated and certified. Theyhave developed standards that they use to reviewproducts. These standards prohibit or limitchemicals that can cause the following: ucancer and reproductive harm uasthma ucorrosive damage to the skin and eyes utoxicity to fish and other aquatic animals uindoor air pollution and other environmental and health problems The 3 main certification agencies EcoLogo is a program of Underwriters Laboratory based in Canada. Some of these products areavailable in the U.S. and some are not. A list ofcertified cleaning products is available athttp://www.ecologo.org/en/certifiedgreenproducts/category.asp?category_id=21&cat=1. Green Seal is a program based in the U.S. and used by many institutional purchasers. A list ofCertified Cleaning Products is available at http://www.greenseal.org/FindGreenSealProductsandServices.aspx?vid=ViewProductDetail&cid=19&sid=23. Design for the Environment (DfE) is a U.S. EPA program. DfE certifies both institutional and retail/consumer products. A list of DfE-certifiedcleaning and other products are available atwww.epa.gov/dfe/products Look for these seals or logos The logo or seal for third-party certified products is on the product container. If a product does not carry a third-party certification logo, look for the following: u Ingredients listed on the label u No signal word \"Danger\" on the label.\"Signal words\" on the label are used toindicate the product's relative level ofseverity of hazard andalert the reader to a potential hazard. u Non-aerosol u No overwhelmingchemical odor u Fragrance-free u Dye-free To make choosing products easier, go to theTranspare website where you can use their searchapplication to find and compare saferinstitutional cleaning products. www.transpare.com 28 Section 7: Choosing safer products for cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting Ingredients to avoid If you can't find third-party certified products, avoid the ingredients on this list. They can beharmful to our health or the environment. u2-butoxyethanol (or monobutyl listed as FD&C or Choosing safer cleaning products An ECE facility can be cleaned using just a fewproducts. There are two types of productsavailable for cleaning a public space: Institutional products uThese are purchased from a cleaning products distributor. uThey are often not available in retail stores in the community. For example, untilrecently, some of the newer and lesshazardous accelerated hydrogen peroxide-based products have been available onlythrough distributors. u They are available as a concentrate that can be diluted with water for different cleaningtasks. Distributors will provide the dilutionstations and labeled bottles that meetOccupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) requirements forhazard communication for the dilutedproducts. It's important when using aconcentrate to dilute the product asrecommended on the label. u They come accompanied by Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) that you must have on site tosatisfy OSHA rules. u Institutional products are generally less expensive than similar products available inretail stores. Most distributors carry products certified as saferby a third-party (Green Seal, EcoLogo, Design forthe Environment). For more information on howto set up group purchasing through a distributor,see Appendix B: Tips on Forming a Buying Cooperative on page 56. Retail products uThese are purchased at a retail store like a grocery store. uThey come available in ready-to-use containers or as concentrates such asbleach. u Concentrated products do not come with dilution equipment, increasing healthhazards for the user. u Some are certified as safer by a third-party (Green Seal, EcoLogo, Design for theEnvironment). u Safety data sheets must be downloaded from the internet or you may have tocontact the manufacturer for a copy. 29Section 7: Choosing safer products for cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting 30Choosing safer sanitizers Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards recommends sanitizing for toys, thermometers, pacifiers,teething toys, eating utensils, tables and highchair trays, food preparation areas, mixed usetables, and computer keyboards. (See AppendixD: Model Center Policy on When and Where toClean, Sanitize, and Disinfect in ECE.) When choosing a sanitizer, look for the following: uA 0 rating on the Hazardous Materials Identification System (HMIS) health rating scale uThe signal word \"Caution\" (rather than \"Danger\" or \"Warning\") on the productlabel u EPA registration number (verifies that the product is registered by the EPA to kill thegerms claimed on the label) u Approval for food contact surfaces u Short dwell time (the time the sanitizer must be left visibly wet on the surface andin contact with the germs to kill them). Forexample, 10 minutes would be considered avery long dwell time and would most likelyrequire re-wetting for proper compliancewith the label. Choosing safer disinfectants There are many different types of disinfectantsavailable. When selecting and using disinfectants,always check for the following: uDoes the product have an EPA Registration Number? All disinfectants are required tohave an EPA Registration number. uIs it approved for the task and surface you will use it on? uWill it damage the surfaces cleaned with it? u What germs does it kill? Not all disinfectants kill all germs. A \"hospital grade\" disinfectant sounds like it kills all sorts of germs, but it is only required to kill two target organisms:Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Many identify other germs that they kill as well, but you have tocheck the label. Many infectious diseases found in ECE are caused by viruses. Make sure you choosea product that is effective against viruses. u What is the dilution ratio of the product? (How do I mix it correctly?) u Is it a \"one-step\" disinfectant-cleaner or a disinfectant that requires you to clean thesurface first? (Even when using one-stepproducts you have to pre-clean heavilysoiled areas.) Bleach Sodium hypochlorite, or bleach, has long been used in ECE to sanitize and disinfect. Recently, bleach has been declared an asthmagen by the Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics. Anasthmagen is something that can causeasthma. Recent changes in the concentrationof EPA-registered bleach products also makecorrect dilution more confusing and difficult.There are safer products available. For thisreason, we are not recommending the use of bleach in ECE to sanitize and disinfect. For more information, see Fact Sheet: What's the Problem with Bleach? Section 7: Choosing safer products for cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting The EPA's Design for the Environment Antimicrobial Pesticide Pilot Project is the only program that can legally certify disinfecting products that are less hazardous for human health and the environment in the U.S. If you see the DfE logo on an EPA-registered antimicrobial pesticide (disinfectant) label, you can be assuredthat the product uis in the least-hazardous classes (i.e. III and IV) of EPA's acute toxicity categoryhierarchy; uis unlikely to have carcinogenic or endocrine disruptor properties; uis unlikely to cause developmental, reproductive, mutagenic, or neurotoxiceffects; uhas been shown to be effective against the microbes listed on the label (associated withthe Antimicrobial Testing Program orotherwise). For more information on the Design for theEnvironment Pilot Project, go to:http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/labels/design-dfe-pilot.html#means Group buying Buying institutional cleaners or disinfectants andsanitizers from a cleaning products distributor involume can help save money. If you belong to agroup with other ECE programs, or to a grouprepresenting ECE programs, you can buy yourcleaning products together from an institutionaldistributor. (See Appendix B: Tips on Forming a Buying Cooperative on page 56). You should request bids from several distributorsto compare prices for the following third-party certified products: u One concentrate that is diluted for the following tasks: Bathroom/restroom cleaner All-purpose cleaner Carpet spotter/extraction cleaner Glass and window cleaner Neutral floor cleaner u Heavy-duty cleaning product u Hand soaps (with no antibacterial properties) and hand sanitizers Foaming hand soap is a form of liquid soap that has been whipped with air tocreate a foam of soap bubbles. This styleof soap requires special dispensers, but itis easier to apply and lather, and results inless soap and water use. The dispensersare also less likely to clog and drip. u Environmentally preferable and safer disinfectants and sanitizers. If possiblechoose a product that has been certified bythe Design for the Environment DisinfectantPilot Program. For a list, visithttp://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/labels/design-dfe pilot.html#means A 0-1 rating on the Hazardous Materials Identification System (HMIS) health scale(See Section 10 for more information). u Floor and carpet care products that are effective, safer alternatives to the manyhighly hazardous products on the market Wax stripper Floor sealer and finish Carpet cleaner u Mineral build-up remover (used on toilets; typically a highly hazardous product forwhich there are effective, less hazardousalternatives) Safety Data Sheets Material Safety Data Sheets are now called Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) under new OSHA requirements. See Section10: What is a Hazard Commununication Program for more information on how to read a SDS. 31 Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Section 8:Clean isn't a smell! Scented products are everywhere in our daily lives. Fragrance is added to personal care andhousehold products and many other items thatwe use each day. Most products used to clean,sanitize, and disinfect contain fragrances. Airfresheners are often used in ECE by staff memberswho want to make indoor areas smell better,especially when diapers are being changedfrequently. But fragrances do not clean the air.They disguise the smells by adding more chemicals to the air. Manufacturers of cleaning products use fragrances for many reasons besides making theproduct smell nice. Fragrances are used to umake you associate a particular smell with use of their product; uhide or mask unpleasant odors that come from chemicals in the product; usignal to you that the product has worked and the area where it has been used isclean. It is a common mistake to think that if a cleaningproduct doesn't leave a scent after use, theproduct didn't work and the area is not clean. Forexample, when you smell a citrus fragrance aftercleaning it does not mean the product is safer,more \"natural,\" or does its job. Cleaning,sanitizing, and disinfecting products all containchemicals. Products that have a fragrance containadditional chemicals that may pose health risksand are unnecessary. Even \"unscented\" or\"fragrance-free\" products may contain chemicalswhich are added to mask the smell of thechemicals. Nevertheless, it is better to buy aproduct marked fragrance-free than one thatcontains fragrance when possible. Fragrances enter the body in many ways. They are uabsorbed through the skin; uinhaled into the lungs; uswallowed, especially by children with hand-to-mouth behaviors. Health effects of fragrance chemicals in air fresheners and \"fragranced\" cleaners,sanitizers, and disinfectants uFragrances can irritate the lungs and trigger asthma, headaches, and allergic contact dermatitis (skin reactions). uHigher levels of some fragrance chemicals have been linked to reproductive problemsin women. uSome fragrance chemicals have been linked to certain types of cancer. Phthalates are chemicals used as solvents andcarriers for fragrances. Phthalates can accumulatein the human body. They are excreted in breastmilk, exposing nursing infants who are especiallyvulnerable to the health effects of chemicalsbecause their bodies are developing rapidly.Phthalates are endocrine disruptors. They havebeen linked to uan increase in prostate and breast cancer; uadverse reproductive system outcomes, including reduced semen quality andaltered male genital development; uneurodevelopment problems, such as attention disorders, in children who areexposed prenatally. 32 Section 8: Clean isn't a smell! Air fresheners Air fresheners are particularly concentrated sources of fragrances that are full of toxicchemicals. uThe hazards of air fresheners are hidden. Like cleaning products, potentiallyhazardous chemicals contained infragrances are not required to be listed onthe label. uSome chemicals in air fresheners are sensitizers that can lead to allergies. Theycan also trigger asthma, allergic reactions,wheezing, headaches, and contactdermatitis. uSome chemicals in fragrances are endocrine disruptors, mimicking or disrupting thebody's own hormones. uCommon air freshener chemicals, such as limonene, can also react with otherchemicals, particularly ozone. This results inthe creation of additional hazardouspollutants such as formaldehyde, which is linked with cancer and can cause asthma, and acetaldehyde, which is also linked withcancer; ultrafine particles that can be inhaled deep into the lung. They are linked withheart and lung disease. The use of a single air freshener can also violatethe Americans with Disabilities Act, becausepeople who experience disabling health effectsfrom air fresheners cannot access the publicfacility. In two national studies, approximately20% of the U.S. population and 40% of personswith asthma, reported headaches, breathingdifficulties, or other health problems whenexposed to air fresheners or deodorizers. Are \"natural\" air fresheners any safer? uNot necessarily. In tests, all air fresheners tested gave off chemicals classified as toxic or hazardous, even those advertised as\"natural,\" \"green,\" \"organic,\" or that contained essential oils. Some of thesechemicals have been found to be unsafeeven in very small amounts. uThe toxic chemicals given off by \"natural\" air fresheners were not significantlydifferent from other brands. uThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently released new guidelines, the Green Guides, designed to ensure that the environmental claims made by marketersare truthful. These new guidelinesdiscourage marketers from using generalenvironmental claims such as \"natural,\"\"green\" or \"eco-friendly.\" Unfortunately,the guidelines are not regulations. The FTCcan take action against companies that aredeceptive, but they have done so in only ahandful of cases over the last 20 years.Many companies continue to make claimsthat their products are \"green,\" or\"natural,\" or \"organic\" when these termshave no legal definition. How to avoid fragrances and their health effects uChoose third-party certified products that are labeled unscented or \"free and clear.\" uLook for products that do not have \"fragrance\" listed as an ingredient (but remember that fragrances are notnecessarily listed on the label). uAvoid products with a strong smell. uUse ventilation instead of air fresheners. uLook for items marked \"phthalate-free.\" Note: Products called \"fragrance-free\" and \"unscented\" are not necessarily less hazardous.Even if a product does not contain a fragrance, itcould still contain other chemicals that areclassified as toxic or hazardous. For moreinformation on the chemicals in a product, readthe Safety Data Sheet from the manufacturer, orcheck on the manufacturer's website. 33Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Section 9:What are the most effective and safest ways of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in ECE? Each ECE program should have a written procedure for cleaning, sanitizing, anddisinfecting. State child care regulations are goodsources for learning about requirements andfinding examples of cleaning schedules andprocedures. See Appendix D for the Caring for Our Children recommendations and requirements for cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in ECE. Routine cleaning Cleaning physically removes visible dirt, dust, oils,and germs (microbes - viruses, fungi, andbacteria). The cleaning process uses an all-purpose detergent and water, and a scrubbingmotion, just like washing our hands using soap,water, and rubbing. Always read product labelsand follow directions. Cleaning should be donebefore sanitizing or disinfecting because germscan hide underneath dirt and debris where theyescape being killed by a disinfectant. Mostdisinfectants require a thorough cleaning prior toapplication, whereas \"one-step\" disinfectants canclean and disinfect but require that you pre-cleanheavily soiled areas. Some disinfectants, such asbleach and quaternary ammonium compounds,lose their ability to disinfect well in the presenceof dirt. High-touch surfaces(surfaces that aretouched many times aday by as doorknobs, door push bars,sink handles, sharedcomputer keyboardsand mice, telephones, microwave and elevatorbuttons, and light switches should be cleanedwith detergent, water, and a microfiber clothmore frequently to control the spread ofinfectious diseases. Some state child care licensingregulations may require that some of these high-touch surfaces be disinfected as well. This isespecially true if there is an outbreak of aninfectious disease in your program. Tools for cleaning uWalk-off mats placed at all of your entryways help to capture the debris anddirt tracked in on shoes. They also reduce wear and tear on floors and carpeting. Look for good quality multi-level scrapermats with rubber backings that hold water.Where possible 15' to 20' is recommendedfor maximum effect, but any length willhelp keep the floors cleaner. Vacuum thewalk-off mats daily. uMicrofiber (preferably ultra-fine high quality microfiber) cleaning cloths andmops work well for removing organic matter (dirt, oils, grease) as well as germsfrom surfaces. Microfibers used for cleaningare split many times to increase theirabsorbing capacity. Split microfiber qualityvaries. Microfiber that catches slightly onthe surface of your hand is better quality. Alaundering program is necessary ifmicrofiber is used. This can include washingmops and cloths by hand, by machine, orusing a laundering service. Laundering willhelp prevent the spread of germs from onesurface to another (called cross-contamination). 34Section 9: What are the most effective and safest ways of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in ECE? See Fact Sheet: What's So Great About Microfiber? If microfiber is not available, recycled content paper towels are alternatives, but will not provide as muchgerm removal as microfiber. uVacuums come in many different shapes and styles. There are websites that ratevacuums and industrial versions areavailable through cleaning productdistributors. (Ask your local school who theypurchase their vacuums from.) Look for avacuum with a bag indicator light that tellsyou when the bag should be changed.Some vacuums also have a green indicatorlight that tells you when no more dirt isbeing removed from the carpet. This helpsyou to know how long to vacuum a rug.Regular vacuuming also helps carpets to lastlonger. Dirt is abrasive and can ruin carpetfibers if it is ground into the carpet. Themore often you vacuum, the more dirt youremove before it can damage carpeting.Empty the bag when it is half filled or whenthe indicator light comes on to ensure thatthe vacuum sucks at full power. Floors andcarpets need to be vacuumed daily. HEPA or high-filtration vacuums filter out more dirt and germs than traditionalvacuums. Traditional vacuums can actuallyblow small particles of dust back out of thevacuum and into the air! HEPA vacuumsare the best choice for preventing dustfrom floor and carpets from getting intothe indoor air. Vacuuming captures moredust and dirt than sweeping. It can alsoreduce exposure to compounds such asfire-retardant chemicals, lead and othermetals, and some phthalates that arelargely found in dust. uBuffers and burnishers are machines used to clean, scrub or strip the finish from avinyl floor. They also restore the glossy lookto a floor that has had a finish applied.These machines can contribute toparticulate matter in indoor air which cancause health problems. Buffers andburnishers should be equipped with a high-efficiency vacuum to capture the particlesthat are created when performing thesetasks. They should not be used whenoccupants are in the building. Installingrubber floors makes burnishingunnecessary. They only need to be scrubbedwith a microfiber mop and plain water andbuffed with a cleaning pad are safer thanvinyl. Carpeting tips Cleaning products and procedures A third-party certified all-purpose product is the best choice for routine cleaning. See Section 7:Choosing Safer Products for Cleaning, Sanitizing,and Disinfecting. These are available as a concentrate (need to be diluted) or in ready-to-use (already diluted) form. Carpeting can collect dust, dirt, and germs that are hard to remove. They can also trigger allergies and asthma. Smallerarea rugs that can be laundered or removed for cleaning area safer choice than wall-to-wall carpeting. If your carpeting needs replacing, choose products approved under the GreenGuard Gold certification or the Carpet andRug Institute's Green Label or Green Label Plus program.Carpets with low pile height and low pile density are easierto clean. Request carpeting and carpet padding that doesnot contain formaldehyde. Research tells us that vacuuming can help reduce asthma episodes, allergies, and other health problems related todust in indoor air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA or high-filtration filter so that the dust is retained inside the filter. Take your time and vacuum slowly. This picks up more dust and dirt. A dust finder indicator light that turns green whenno more dust is being removed can be very helpful indetermining if the carpet has been properly cleaned.Vacuuming should be done when children and staff aregone for the day. 35Section 9: What are the most effective and safest ways of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in ECE? Surface cleaning Put on non-latex chemical-resistant gloves (nitrile or neoprene are best) when using cleaning products. All cleaning productshave some effect on the skin. Spray or squirt the solution on a microfiber cloth or paper towel and apply to thesurface to be cleaned. Wipe or scrub the surface until it appears clean. Rinse the cloth in clean water or, if the cloth is very soiled, use a new damp cloth(or a new paper towel) to rinse the surface. Allow to air dry or wipe dry with a clean cloth if the surface is to be usedimmediately. Dispose of towels and/or place washable cloths in a closed receptacle container orlaundry basket for laundering. Floor cleaning Fill a bucket with water and add the cleaning solution (unless you have dilutedthe product using a dilution station, whichis safer) according to label instructions. It isideal to have a split bucket system with thecleaning solution on one side and the rinsewater on the other side. This will help tokeep the cleaning solution from gettingdirty. Place microfiber mop heads in the cleaning solution. Mop each room's floor until it appears clean and then change the microfiber mophead. Bathroom floors should be moppedlast. Place used microfiber mop heads in a container for laundering. Most floors can be cleaned and don't need to be disinfected, unless it is required bylicensing regulations. If body fluids arepresent, disinfect floors after cleaning. u Apply the disinfectant to the floors following the label instructions and leavevisibly wet on the floor for therecommended dwell time. u Rinse if required by the label instructions. Manufacturers may claim that their productsare \"green,\" \"natural,\" or \"earth-friendly,\" but such claims are often meaningless or misleading. To ensure that the products youbuy are safer for health and the environ-ment, look for the certification logo of independent third-party organizations. EcoLogo and Green Seal criteria cover manycharacteristics, such as toxicity and corrosivity limits, and ucause allergic-type endocrinedisruptors. 36Section 9: What are the most effective and safest ways of cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting in ECE? What not to use and why The use of cotton cloths, cotton mops, and sponges is not recommended. Cotton cloths do not clean surfaces or capture germs as well as microfiber. They canactually spread germs from one surface toanother. They do not last as long as micro-fiber after frequent washing. The use ofcotton with a quaternary disinfectant canreduce the effectiveness of the disinfectant.Cotton mops are much heavier, especially when fully wet, than microfiber mops and are more likely to cause injuries to the user.They can move germs from one area toanother if not properly handled. It is moredifficult to replace and launder cotton mopheads than microfiber mop heads.Sponges should not be used for cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting because they arehard to clean and bacteria grow in them. Carpet cleaning Vacuum carpets at least daily or more frequentlyif needed, to pick up spills of food and otherparticles. Carpets should be thoroughly cleaned(steam cleaning recommended) every 3 months oras needed. Steam or hot water extractioncleaning is typically done by a service usingequipment mounted on a truck or by a portablesystem brought inside the building. Hot water issprayed under high pressure into the carpet andimmediately vacuumed out along with dirt. Whendone properly, steam cleaning can clean evenheavily soiled carpets. Sometimes detergent isalso used, but low quality detergent, too muchdetergent, or overly concentrated detergent mayleave sticky residues that can attract dirt. In caseof blood or body fluid spills, wash thoroughly and rinse.Cleaning tips Clean first before you disinfect. Germs can hide underneath dirt and other material onsurfaces where they are not affected by thedisinfectant. Dirt and organic material can also reduce the germ-killing ability of somedisinfectants. Use warm or hot water with any cleaning product unless the label states the product is formulated to be effective in cold water. Scrub vigorously with a microfiber cloth to remove dirt. Use a brush if the item is not smooth or has hard-to-reach corners wheredirt and germs can hide, such as toys andbottles. Clean completely on a regular schedule (see Appendix D or your state child careregulations for a recommended schedule) and spot clean as needed. Change water when it looks or feels dirty, and after cleaning bathrooms, diaperchanging areas, and the kitchen. Clean the least dirty items and surfaces first (for example, countertops before floors andsinks before toilets). Store materials and toys in plastic tubs that are easier to keep clean. Clean from top to bottom - high surfaces first, then low surfaces. Apply cleaning products to a microfiber cloth with a stream or coarse spray and thenwipe the surface to be cleaned (instead of spraying the product directly on the surface.)This protects the user from breathing the mist that bounces back from the hard surfaces and contaminates the air. Remove microfiber mop pads from the handle and hand wash, rinse, and hang to dry, or place in a bag for daily laundering.Treat microfiber cloths the same way. See Fact Sheet: What's So Great About Microfiber? 37Section 9: What are the most effective and safest ways of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in ECE? Diluting concentrated products The safest way to dilute concentrated products is to use a product dispensing system. The dispensing system automaticallydilutes the concentrate, and in doing soimproves safety and conserves resources: uIt minimizes waste by correctly diluting the product. Using too concentrated asolution increases costs, but using theright amount improves how well theproduct works. uIt prevents exposures to you and your staff and prevents spills of productconcentrates. Ready-to-use (already diluted) products can alsobe purchased in bulk and transferred to smallercontainers using a dispensing system to reduceexposure to chemicals. Product vendors will oftenprovide dispensing equipment at no cost ifenough product is purchased from them. Whendispensing products from a larger container to asmaller one, labeling is required for the smaller\"secondary\" container. See Section 10: What is a Hazard Communication Program?Sanitizing A sanitizer is a product or device that reducesgerms on surfaces to levels considered safe bypublic health codes or regulations. Sanitizerswork by killing germs. For food service this levelshould be a 99.999% reduction in the number ofmicroorganisms within 30 seconds. The level forhard surfaces not used for food service should beat least 99.9%. Sanitizing products should stateon their label the surfaces they are intended tobe used on. Sanitizing in child care is required for specific areas such as food preparation and contactsurfaces, and mouthed toys and pacifiers. Statechild care regulations and Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety PerformanceStandards, Routine Schedule for Cleaning,Sanitizing, and Disinfecting, Appendix K specify what needs to be sanitized on a regular basis.(See Appendix D: What, Where and How Often to Clean, Sanitize, and Disinfect in ECE for a copy of the CFOC recommendations.) Tools for sanitizing Sanitizing can be done with a chemical product, asanitizing device, or in a dishwasher. uMicrofiber cloths work well for spreading sanitizers on surfaces. uDishwashers are a great option for sanitizing dishes, eating utensils, mouthedplastic toys, and pacifiers and theyeliminate the need for chemical sanitizers. uDevices Steam cleaners can be used to sanitize, deodorize, and remove grease, dirt, andproduct residues thoroughly and quicklywithout chemicals. They can be used onmany surfaces, including bathroomfixtures, floors and countertops,carpeting, and upholstery. Dry vapor steam cleaners use super-heated low moisture steam - no chemicals - fordisinfecting, sanitizing, and cleaningsurfaces. They are very effective andapproved for food contact as well as 38A dispensing system protects your staff, assures proper dilution, and can save on product costs.Section 9: What are the most effective and safest ways of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in ECE? other surfaces including carpets and upholstery. They are one of the mosteffective ways to remove bacteria thathave formed a biofilm (see page 41 formore information on biofilm). No-touch cleaning systems may be used with an EPA registered sanitizer. Thesesystems spray cleaning solution/sanitizeron soiled fixtures and floors, then washsoils to the floor using pressurized water,and finally vacuum the floor dry. Theequipment includes three maincomponents: an indoor pressure washer, awet vacuum system, and a dilutioncomponent. Products and procedures for sanitizing An EPA registered sanitizer or sanitizing devicethat is rated for food contact surfaces should beused when sanitizing surfaces as recommendedby state child care regulations or CFOC. (SeeAppendix D: What, Where and How Often to Clean, Sanitize, and Disinfect in ECE.) Sanitizing food preparation areas using a chemical sanitizer Clean the surface first as described on page 36. Read and follow the instructions on the product label for sanitizing food contact or other hard surfaces. Sanitize the surface using a sanitizing solution mixed at the concentrationspecified on the label or a ready-to-usesanitizer. Apply the sanitizer using a stream or squirt bottle. Allow to remain on the surface for the dwell time listed on the product label. Thismeans visibly wet. Use a timer. If theproduct dries before the end of the dwelltime, reapply. Products that have a shorterdwell time (about 1 minute) are easier touse because they don't requirereapplication. See federal and state regulations for specific requirements. Some cleaning products may claim that rinsing isn't necessary, but all products leave a residue that can contribute to particulatematter in the air over time. Rinsing non-foodcontact surfaces avoids this problem. Place cloths in a receptacle for laundering. Hand-washed dishes If a 3-compartment sink is used, set up and use the sink in the following manner: u Wash dishes in the first compartment using a clean detergent solution andwater at or above 110\u00b0F, or at thetemperature specified by the detergentmanufacturer. u Rinse in the second compartment with clean water. u Sanitize in the third compartment with a food grade sanitizing solution mixed atthe concentration specified on themanufacturer's label or by immersing inhot water at or above 171\u00b0F for 30seconds. Make sure you have the correctsanitizer concentration by using anappropriate test kit. Automatic dishwashers Use a dishwasher with a sanitizing cycle that iscertified to meet NSF/ANSI 184 standard (Seehttp://www.nsf.org/certified/consumer/listings_results.aspfor listings). This standard helps confirm that aresidential dishwasher can achieve a minimum99.999% reduction of bacteria when operated onthe sanitizing cycle. Follow manufacturer'sinstructions for use. 39Section 9: What are the most effective and safest ways of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in ECE? Mouthed toys (hard, non-porous surfaces only) and pacifiers Place in the automatic dishwasher and follow the instructions above for dishwasher use. Only toys with hard, non-porous surfaces can be sanitized or disinfected. Toys with porous surfaces need to be laundered. Boil pacifiers for one minute in drinkable water. Washing by hand uWash toys in a detergent and water solution and rinse with water. uImmerse the toys in the sanitizer solution and wait for the recommended dwell time. Rinse the toys if the label requiresthis step (you may want to rinse anyway,if children are mouthing the toys). Allowto air dry or dry with a clean cloth orpaper towel. For toys that cannot be immersed: uApply the sanitizer according to label instructions by spraying or squirting theproduct on one side of the toy andwaiting for the recommended dwelltime, then the other side and wait again.Rinse with clean water and air-dry or dryusing a clean microfiber cloth or a papertowel.Electronics/keyboards A flexible silicone cover makes cleaning and sanitizing keyboards much easier. Wipe with a sanitizer and a clean microfiber cloth or a paper towel. Don't spray sanitizer on a keyboard. Sanitizingwipes can also be used on keyboards. Dirt can make disinfectants less effective - clean first, then disinfect. Disinfecting Disinfecting works by using chemicals or devices to kill almost all the germs on surfaces or objects.This process does not necessarily clean dirtysurfaces or remove germs. By killing germs on a surface after cleaning, the risk of spreadinginfection is lower. Disinfecting kills germs oncontact, whereas cleaning works by washingaway the germs that can be removed. Areas to be disinfected include door and cabinet handles touched by children, drinking fountains, bathroom fixtures, and objects in toilet anddiapering areas. (See Appendix D: What, Where and How Often to Clean, Sanitize, and Disinfect in ECE.) 40Section 9: What are the most effective and safest ways of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in ECE?

See http://nrckids.org/STATES/states.htm to check your state's regulations for more specific information.Many states require the use of a hospital-gradedisinfectant in ECE. Bacteria, a type of germ, are sometimes ableto form dense mats called biofilm that form aprotective environment for germs. Biofilms form on surfaces that are constantly wet.When bacteria land on a hard, moist surface,they can easily be removed. But if they are notremoved, they form stronger attachments tosurfaces and to each other, creating acommunity within a protective shell thatincreases their ability to survive and grow. Thisbiofilm develops within hours. It protects thebacteria from cleaners and disinfectants,which can kill only the bacteria on the outerlayer. Once formed, the bacteria withinbiofilms are up to 1000 times more resistantto disinfectants than the same bacteria thatare not part of a biofilm. To reach themicrobes within the biofilm, friction must beused to break down the shell. Microfibercloths or mops, brushes, or steam vapor canbe used to penetrate the biofilm. Key placesin ECE buildings where biofilms develop arecontinuously damp or wet areas around sinkfaucets, food preparation areas, and drains.To prevent the development of biofilm, keepsurfaces clean and dry. Water and food arewhat bacteria require in order to grow andform biofilm. Biofilm Once formed, the bacteria within biofilms are up to 1000 times more resistant to disinfectants than thesame bacteria that are not part of a biofilm. 41At first, germs on surfaces are easily removed and killed by mild cleaners andsanitizers.But within hours, germs inthe growing biofilm becomefirmly attached to the surface and to each other.Germs within the biofilmgrow, reproduce, and learnto communicate with eachother.They form a more stablebiofilm that is hard to penetrate with disinfectants. The thriving and well protected colony of germsprovides a continuous supply of germs that easilydetach and contaminateother surfaces. Section 9: What are the most effective and safest ways of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in ECE? Hard surfaces (drinking fountains, toilets, etc.) Put on chemical-resistant gloves (nitrile, rubber are best) and other personal protective equipment as recommended onthe label when using disinfectants. Follow the instructions for surface cleaning on page 36. Follow the instructions on the disinfectant product label to disinfect surfaces correctly. Spray or squirt the disinfectant on the microfiber cloth or paper towel and applyto the surface, or squirt the productdirectly on the surface so that the surface isvisibly wet. Avoid fine aerosol sprays. Theycan be inhaled and irritate the lungs. Somecan cause or trigger asthma. Allow to remain visibly wet on the surface for the dwell time listed on the productlabel. Reapply if needed for the surface tostay wet for the entire dwell time. Rinse with a clean microfiber cloth or paper towel if required by labelinstructions. Allow to air-dry, or wipe dry with a clean cloth, if the surface is to be usedimmediately. Dispose of paper towels and place washable cloths in a receptacle forlaundering. Bathroom floors Follow the instructions on page 36 for cleaning floors. Read and follow the instructions on the label for the correct way to use the productselected for disinfecting floors. There maybe separate instructions (on the productlabel or in state regulations) on how todisinfect if body fluids are present. Place clean microfiber mop heads in the disinfecting solution or squirt disinfectingsolution directly on the area to bedisinfected. Use the mop to spread thedisinfectant until the surface is visibly wet. Allow the disinfectant to remain wet on the floor for the recommended dwell time.Reapply if needed for the floor to remainvisibly wet for the entire dwell time. Rinse if required by label instructions using a clean microfiber mop head or cottonmop that has been washed and rinsed inclean water and allow to air-dry. Hang cotton mops to dry or launder immediately (do not leave soaking in ableach solution) and place microfiber mopheads in a separate container forlaundering. 42 Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Section 10: What is a Hazard Communication Program? By law, every employer is responsible for providing their employees with a safe andhealthy work place. Communicating to employeesabout chemical hazards present in the workplaceis an important part of this responsibility. TheOSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS)requires chemical manufacturers, importers,distributors, and employers to provide hazardinformation to employees and customers. As employers, ECE programs must have someone, such as a child care health advocate, on staff whois trained to recognize the potential hazards ofdiverse chemicals. A hazardous chemical is anychemical that is u a physical hazard (for example, it might explode or start a fire); u a health hazard (it may cause short- or long-term health effects in employees whoare exposed). Someone on your ECE staff must also know howto protect your facility's employees from thesehazards through u work policies and procedures; u the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Information about the products used in ECE andtheir health hazards must be available andunderstandable to your ECE staff. ECE employeeshave both a need and a right to know whatchemicals they are exposed to when working andthe hazards of those chemicals. Where does the Hazard Communication Standard apply? This OSHA requirement applies anywhere employees may be exposed to hazardouschemicals. In ECE, cleaners, sanitizers, anddisinfectants typically used by staff in theirroutine work and in emergencies are potentiallyhazardous to both staff using them and thechildren in the facility. Therefore, OSHA's HCSapplies to all ECE staff members who work withthese products. What does the Hazard Communication Standard require? This standard requires the facility to develop a written Hazard Communication Program thatincludes the following: u Your plans for managing your Safety Data Sheets, which provide information on thechemical products in your facility, and alabeling system for product containers u How you train your employees about hazardous products and their safer use andmanagement u A list of hazardous products used in your facility u Methods to inform employees of the hazards of non-routine tasks involvinghazardous products, such as emergencyresponse spill clean-up u Methods to communicate hazards to outside contractors who may be exposed tohazardous products in your ECE facility 43Section 10: What is a Hazard Communication Program? Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) for hazardous products SDSs (formerly Material Safety Data Sheets, or MSDSs) provide important information that youwill need to safely manage the chemical productsused in your ECE facility. ECE programs and staffshould use the SDSs for the products they use u as sources of information about hazards; u to obtain advice on what safety precautions to take when using the product. The SDS provides general information about theproduct. It does not help you with the specificprecautions you should take when the product isused in an ECE environment. However, the SDSinformation enables you to develop a program toprotect your staff and the children in yourprogram. A product's SDS also providesinformation for others who may needinformation about the product, such asemergency responders and poison controlcenters. u You must obtain an SDS from your supplier or from the internet for each hazardousproduct used in your facility. u SDSs for the hazardous chemicals must be kept on site and readily accessible toemployees when requested. Label requirements for containers of hazardous products u Original labels must be attached to containers of hazardous products when they are purchased. u Secondary containers are the containers you use when you take product out of anoriginal container and put it into anothercontainer, such as a spray bottle. Allsecondary containers of hazardous productsmust be labeled with the followinginformation: The name of the hazardous chemical(s) Warnings for specific hazards: Health hazards with the parts of the body that may be affected (such aseyes, skin, and respiratory system) Physical hazards (for example: flammable) The name and address of the chemicalmanufacturer u Labels must be: Readable and understandable In English Prominently displayed u Removing or defacing labels on incoming containers of hazardous products isprohibited. Information and training u Information and training on hazardous products must be provided when employees are hired; when new physical hazards or health hazards are introduced into the workarea; annually. u The information provided must include the regulatory requirements described above,as well as the following: The work areas where hazardous products are present The location and availability of the written Hazard Communication Program,the list of hazardous chemicals, and SDSs An explanation of an employee's \"Rightto Know\" about the chemicals being usedin the workplace and their health andsafety risks A plan of whom to contact and what todo in an emergency involving a haz-ardous product 44Section 10: What is a Hazard Communication Program? u The training on hazardous products must include information about the following: How to detect the presence or release of a hazardous chemical (such as visual appearance or odor). The possible physical or health hazards ofthe materials used in the ECE program How ECE staff can protect themselves from product hazards, including workpractices, emergency procedures, andpersonal protective equipment such asgloves or mask The information in the Hazard Communication Program, including howemployees can obtain and use hazard information How to understand and use SDSs How containers should be labeled What to do in case of a product spill or contact with a hazardous product How to dispose of unused hazardousproducts and packaging The Hazardous Materials Identification System (HMIS\u00ae) This labeling system provides \"at-a-glance\" communication of information to employees onthe hazards of a product. The label identifies u general health, flammability, and physical hazards using color-coded fields; u recommendations for personal protective equipment that should be used whenworking with the product. Using the HMIS label on all containers in yourfacility will help you to meet OSHA's HazardCommunication Standard. It is recommended thatthey be used on all containers, even if themanufacturer's label is still in place. Blank andproduct specific preprinted HMIS labels can bepurchased online or may be available from thedistributor who sold the product. Blue indicates health hazard, red indicates flammability, yellow indicates instability (forexample, is it flammable or explosive), and thewhite section provides special information (suchas what personal protective equipment to wear).The HMIS also uses a numerical system from 0-4to indicate the severity of the hazard. Using the HMIS label on all containers in your facility will help you to meet OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard. 45Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Section 11: What is the most effective and safest way to clean body fluids and blood spills in ECE? Unlike most other spills, blood, feces, and vomit require more careful cleaning methods. Thesespills can endanger your health. The followingguidelines are meant to ensure that body fluidspills (BFSs) are cleaned in a manner that preventsany possibility of future illness related to the spill.(This protocol does not apply to diaper changingareas where fecal contamination has occurred;this is addressed in diaper changing protocols.)This procedure is also part of the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention's \"StandardPrecautions\" for the prevention of the spread ofinfectious disease. This means that you must treatallblood and other potentially infectious material as if it is contaminated by pathogens (germs). Responding to Body Fluid Spills (BFSs) on porous and nonporous surfaces This OSHA requirement applies anywhere employees may be exposed to hazardouschemicals. In ECE, cleaners, sanitizers, anddisinfectants typically used by staff in theirroutine work and in emergencies are potentiallyhazardous to both staff using them and thechildren in the facility. Therefore, OSHA's HazardCommunication Standard (HCS) applies to all ECEstaff members who work with these products. Secure area and notify staff and other responders Prepare to clean up: u Bring prepared spill kit to spill site if there is a BFS. u Select a disinfectant that is registered by the U.S. EPA to disinfect blood spills.Look for this information on the label.Select a cleaner for carpets and adisinfectant for hard surfaces. u Put on personal protective equipment (PPE) (gloves, eye protection, and mask). Remove contaminated objects, spill, and spill waste u Cover all spills with absorbent powder and/or disposable paper or cloth towels,use the kit dustpan to remove thesematerials. u Soak up any liquid absorbed into porous surfaces (like carpeting) with disposablerags. Then wash surface thoroughly andrinse. u Use nonporous equipment such as a dustpan or tongs (not hands or vacuum)to pick up contaminated sharp itemssuch as needles and broken glass. 46Section 11: What is the most effective and safest way to clean body fluids and blood spills in ECE Disinfect hard, non-porous surfaces Apply disinfectant and leave the disinfectant visibly wet on the surface for the required dwell time. u For horizontal surfaces, pour disinfectant directly on to spill area. u For vertical surfaces, spray the disinfectant onto a cloth and wipe onsurface. Dispose of spill waste u Place all materials used in the cleaning process, including PPE, sharp objects,etc., in the bucket with a double-linedplastic bag. Dispose of this waste in thedumpster. Follow-up u Remove your contaminated clothing, double-bag it in 2 mil. bags, label, washseparately in a washing machine in hotwater, and dry on high setting. u Wash your hands and other areas of your body that come into contact with thedisinfectant or body fluid spillimmediately after spill clean-up for atleast 20 seconds with liquid soap underhot running water. u If soap and water are unavailable, use waterless hand sanitizer right away, andthen wash hands as soon as possible. Thehand sanitizer will not work effectively inthe presence of blood. u If you have had an unprotected exposure, immediately contact yourprogram director or a physician. Allow reentry to area of spill when: all materials are removed; area is clean, properly disinfected, and dry. What is a spill kit? A spill kit is used to clean and decontaminate areas where blood spills have occurred. Having a spill kit prepared makes it lessstressful to clean up a spill. They are safe foruse by staff and include personal protectiveequipment for users as well as specialcleaning/decontamination agents. They can be purchased or made. You will need thefollowing items: u Personal protective clothing that is disposable, including gloves, goggles, and an N95 mask. A paper gown should be included to protect yourclothing from cross-contamination when there is a large spill. u Paper towels and an absorbent material. Commercially available absorbent material for spill kits can be purchased. Cat litter or vermiculite can also be used. They are relatively inexpensive and work well, although they are messy. u Tongs and a dustpan u An EPA-registered disinfectant u Plastic bags (red will help identify the contaminated contents) 47 Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Glossary acute effects: nearly immediate signs and symptoms of illness as a result of exposure to harmful agents. acute toxicity: harmful health effects from a single dose or exposure to a toxic chemical or other toxic substance. aerosol: a term that in common use refers to a spray can that emits solid or liquid particles into the air. air freshener: products used to mask unpleasant smells. They contain formaldehyde, phthalates, and other chemicals harmful to health. They arehighly flammable, strong irritants to eyes, skin,and throat. Solid freshners can cause death ifeaten by people or pets. ammonia: a general-purpose cleaner used on many household surfaces including glass, porcelain, and other areas meant to be streak-free. Ammonia-based products are also used forcleaning ovens and soaking items to loosenbaked-on grime. Exposure to high concentrationsof ammonia in ambient air or in an unventilatedarea can cause skin irritation, eye irritation, andburning of the nose, throat, and lower airway.Ammonia can cause asthma. antibiotic resistance: when many bacteria are no longer killed by the antibiotics that are usually used to kill them. The bacteria are now\"resistant\" to these antibiotics and continue tomultiply even if you are taking antibiotics. This isa major problem leading to the development ofmore severe diseases, and in some cases death,when in the past the problem might have beeneasy to cure. antimicrobial pesticides: see disinfecting agents. asthma: chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in the lungs that results in one or several of the following signs/symptoms: wheezing,coughing, chest tightness, and/or troublebreathing. bioaccumulate: when more of a chemical is absorbed and stored by the body than is broken down by or eliminated from the body. biodegradable: the ability of a product to break down in the environment once it enterswastewater treatment plants, rivers and streams or landfills. Unfortunately, the termbiodegradable is unregulated. As a result, mostcleaning supply manufacturers state that theirproduct is biodegradable. It is important toassume that a product with the label is no betterwithout the label. biofilms: thin armored fortresses that microbes build to live, breed, and hide in. Biofilms form when a \"community\" of germs (bacterial, fungal,algal) attaches to a moist surface by secreting aslimy, glue-like substance. body fluid spill (BFS): spill of bodily fluids such as vomit, blood, or feces as a result of an illness or injury. Special precautions need to be taken bythe ECE provider when cleaning a BFS. bleach alternatives (usually referred to as chlorine-free bleach): products that contain a bleach alternative such as oxygen bleach orhydrogen peroxide. Oxygen bleach and hydrogenperoxide are less hazardous than chlorine bleach.If a bleach product must be used, avoid chlorinebleach and use chlorine-free alternatives. chronic toxicity: adverse health effects from repeated doses of a toxic chemical or other toxic substance over a relatively prolonged period oftime, generally greater than one year. cleaning: helps reduce the number of infectious diseases that are passed around in an ECE program by removing and washing some germsdown the drain. This is a safer way to eliminategerms when less hazardous cleaning agents areused. Cleaning also removes dirt and organicmatter that can reduce the effectiveness ofsanitizers and disinfectants. corrosive: a chemical that causes visible destruction of, or irreversible alterations in, living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact.Chemicals can also be corrosive to inanimatesurfaces. For example, bleach is corrosive tostainless steel. detergents: agents that remove soil and organic material from surfaces. This allows for a disinfectant to reach and destroy germs within orbeneath the dirt. 48Glossary direct contact: when body fluids are directly transferred from one person to another and result in spread of infectious disease. Examples ofdirect contact are touching, kissing, and sex. Ananimal bite is also an example of the spread ofgerms by direct contact. disinfecting: a process needed if the surface or item must be free and clear of all visible and microscopic organisms. Disinfecting a surface will\"kill\" up to 99.999% of microscopic organismswithin 10 minutes, or as claimed on the label of aparticular product. disinfecting agents: products registered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as \"antimicrobial pesticides\" that are used tocontrol, prevent, or destroy harmfulmicroorganisms (bacteria, viruses, or fungi) oninanimate objects and surfaces. Antimicrobialproducts include sanitizers, disinfectants, andsterilants (which completely eliminate or destroyall forms of microbial life, including spores). Theymust be certified by the EPA before they can belabeled a disinfectant. dwell time: the amount of time that a sanitizer or disinfectant must be in contact with the surface, and remain wet, in order to achieve the product's advertised kill rate. early care and education (ECE): an umbrella term used for the different types of programs that provide the education and care of children 0 - 5. endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs): compounds that in very small amounts causeillnesses by interfering with or mimicking thenatural hormonal functions of the body. Manychemicals used in fragrances and fragrancedcleaning supplies, pesticides, plastics, andpersonal care products are EDCs. Exposure toEDCs not only poses a health risk duringexposure, but also increases risk of developingdiseases later in life. They can be especiallyharmful to the developing fetus. formaldehyde: a colorless, flammable, strong- smelling chemical that is used in building materials and to produce many householdproducts. Exposure to formaldehyde can lead tocancer and decreased brain activity. Exposure may also result in watery eyes, coughing, wheezing,nausea, skin irritation, and burning sensations inthe eyes, nose, and throat. fragrance: any substance, either natural or man- made, which conveys an odor or scent. More than 3,000 chemicals are used in fragrances. indoor air pollution/indoor air quality: the level of pollution in and around the buildings and structures that we live, work, and play in. Poorindoor air quality can lead to illness. infectious disease: diseases that are spread from one person (or animal) to another. Sometimes called communicable or contagious diseases.These may be caused by virus, bacteria, fungus,protozoa, or other microbes. microfiber: very effective cleaning material made of tiny wedge-shaped fibers that pick up and hold much more dirt, dust, bacteria, and othermicrobes than a traditional cotton-based cleaningproduct. nonporous surface: a smooth, solid surface without pores or holes that limit penetration of liquid below the immediate surface. neurotoxin: toxic substances from chemicals, microorganisms, plants, or animals that interfere with the development and functioning of thenervous system. parabens: a class of chemicals used extensively by both the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries as a preservative. Parabens can disrupt thehormone (endocrine) system and have beenlinked to breast cancer. porous surface: untreated woods, fabrics, and other surfaces that allow absorption of liquids through the top surface. personal protective equipment (PPE): clothing worn to protect workers from hazards such as chemicals and germs. phthalates: chemicals used to make plastics softer and/or more flexible and more durable. Some are endocrine disruptors. For example, they havebeen found to mimic female hormones, resultingin feminization of boys. They are found in airfresheners, in fragrances in cleaning, sanitizing,and disinfecting products, as well as in toys, 49Glossary shower curtains, vinyl flooring, lubricants, adhesives, laundry detergents, nail polish, hairspray, and shampoo. In many instances phthalatesare not identified on product labels. Exposure canoccur through direct contact with productscontaining phthalates, through leaching ofphthalates into other products, or throughgeneral environmental contamination. Phthalatesdo not remain in the body long, but most peoplehave measurable levels of phthalates in theirurine because we are exposed to them constantly. reproductive toxic chemical (toxicant): a chemical that causes damage to or disease in male or female reproductive systems or organs, or thatharms unborn fetuses. respiratory irritant: any substance which can cause inflammation or other harmful reactions in the respiratory system (lungs, nose, mouth, larynxand trachea). Examples of respiratory irritantsinclude tobacco smoke, ozone, bleach and someother inhaled household cleaners, sanitizers anddisinfectants. respiratory sensitizer: a substance that causes an allergic reaction in the respiratory system. Once a person is \"sensitized\" to this substance, furtherexposure to even tiny amounts will producesymptoms. Sensitization generally happens afterseveral months or even years of breathing in thesensitizer. Can cause symptoms ranging fromthose that are like a mild cold or flu to severeasthma symptoms including wheezing, chesttightness, shortness of breath, difficulty breathingand/or coughing. routine disinfection: the elimination of 99.999% of germs from hard surfaces on a regular basis, as required by regulation. Safety Data Sheet (SDS): formerly called Material Safety Data Sheet or MSDS. Contains information on the potential health effects of exposure tochemicals or dangerous substances. The SDScontains information on how to safely use andmanage a hazardous product, appropriatepersonal protective equipment to use, andemergency procedures to follow. The SDS also provides information on how to recognizesymptoms of overexposure and what to do if suchincidents occur. sanitary: the conditions that protect the health of the people in a building, especially cleanliness and reduced exposure to disease-causing germs. sanitize: to reduce to a safe level, but not totally eliminate, microorganisms on a treated surface. sensitizer: material that can cause severe skin responses such as dermatitis and/or respiratory responses such as asthma in a sensitized personafter exposure to a very small amount of thematerial. Sensitization develops over time. Whena person is first exposed to a sensitizer, there maybe no obvious reaction. However, futureexposures can lead to increasingly severereactions in sensitized individuals. Not all exposedpersons will react to sensitizing materials. surfactant: chemical used in certain cleaning products that help to loosen dirt and grease from surfaces so that they can be washed away. Someare safer than others. See the Design for theEnvironment website for information on whichsurfactants are healthier for both you and theenvironment. terpenes: chemicals found in pine, lemon, and orange oils that are used in many cleaning and disinfecting products as well as in fragrances.Terpenes vary in toxicity and can react with ozoneto produce a number of compounds, includingformaldehyde, which causes asthma and cancer. third-party certified products: cleaning products that have been reviewed by one of the following agencies: EcoLogoTMGreen Seal Design for the Environment triclosan: an antibacterial chemical used in various soaps and household cleaners. volatile organic compounds (VOCs): hazardous chemicals that easily evaporate and get into the air. VOCs are released from cleaning productssuch as aerosol sprays, liquid cleaners, drycleaners, solvents, glues, and adhesives. 50Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Resources Resources by section Section 1: What is infectious disease?

Many such products containingredients that may u result in eye, skin or respiratory irritation and chemical burns; u cause or trigger asthma; u cause cancer, or harm a fetus in the womb; u be endocrine disruptors; u affect the developing brain and nervous system. Children are more vulnerable than adults to thehealth effects from exposure to hazardouschemicals for several reasons. They take in morefood, water, and air for their weight and sizethan adults. Their behaviors also put them at risk:mouthing objects and crawling on the floor maybring them into closer contact with toxicchemicals. Their bodies are also less able toprocess and get rid of toxics. Exposure to these chemicals also has serious public health impacts for ECE staff and buildingoccupants. Custodial workers experience one ofthe highest rates of occupational asthma, twicethe rate of other workers. Policy Center name _____________________________________ will purchase less hazardous cleaning, sanitizing,and disinfecting products and devices in order toimprove indoor air quality, enhance and protecthuman and environmental health, foster a moreproductive learning environment, and reduceliability. Additionally, we will implement and practice green cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfectingprocedures to manage and clean our ECE facilityand to minimize exposure to toxic chemicalsrelated to building contaminants and cleaningproducts. The components of this policy includesthe following: uProvide parents, staff, and outside cleaning contractors with: 1. a list of approved cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products and workpractice procedures to be used in thefacility; 2. procedures for safe and appropriate product dilution (if concentrates areused); 3. techniques to mitigate hazards (e.g. ventilation, dilution station, etc.). uProvide parents and staff with print and online resources on green cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting. uDesignate a Green Cleaning Coordinator for our facility who will be trained in green cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting policiesand practices and the prevention ofinfectious disease, and will act as a resourceto our staff and families. uTrain employees to properly and safety use chemicals when they are hired and annuallythereafter, or sooner if new products areintroduced in the facility. uReview the facility periodically using the Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and DisinfectingChecklist. uPost warning signs in areas where cleaning products are locked and stored out of reachof children. uVentilate the area as much as possible while cleaning to minimize exposure. uProvide personal protective equipment for our employees to use when it is necessary. uKeep records. Safety Data Sheets or a list of products and when and how they were usedmust be kept for 30 years as required by theHazard Communication Program. Trainingrecords must also be kept. (See Section 10:What is a Hazard Communication Program?) 54Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Appendix AAppendices: Appendix A: Model Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfection Policy for ECE Programs uLabel cleaning products. Secondary containers of diluted cleaning products without the original label must be labeledaccording to requirements of the OSHAHazard Communication Standard. (SeeSection 10: What is a Hazard Communication Program?) uDevelop a procedure for the use of cleaning cloths. Whenever possible, we will use microfiber. When we use microfiber, we willcolor code the cloths and mops to minimizetransferring germs from one part of thefacility to another. uAvoid known hazardous chemicals when purchasing cleaning products. We will seek to purchase products certified by a third-party, for example, those certified by GreenSeal, EcoLogo, and Design for theEnvironment. If these are not available, wewill avoid products that are aerosols; contain the chemicals listed on page 29. Infectious diseases There are many things to consider when workingto reduce the transmission of infectious disease inchild care settings. Children in ECE are at higherrisk for infectious diseases because they haveimmature personal hygiene habits and theycommonly engage in hand-to-mouth activities.Their immune systems are less developed, so theyare more susceptible to becoming sick whenexposed to disease. This policy strives to preventthe transmission of disease through the use of theleast hazardous means possible. To minimize exposure to infectious disease and hazardous cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfectingproducts, it is our policy that we will: 1. Follow the Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards'Appendix K Schedule for Cleaning,Sanitizing, and Disinfecting listed in Appendix D of the Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting Toolkit for ECE. 2. Train providers in our facility in accordance with the curriculum contained in the Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and DisinfectingToolkit for ECE. 3. Schedule periodic inspections of our facility using the Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting Checklist. 4. Consult the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for instructions onimplementing additional preventive actionsto reduce infectious disease if an outbreakof a serious infectious disease occurs. 5. Purchase least-hazardous sanitizers, disinfectants, and hand hygiene products asdescribed in Section 7 of the Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and DisinfectingToolkit Curriculum. 55Tips on Forming a Buying Cooperative Many of the newer and less harmful cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products on themarket are only available through distributors.Distributors buy in quantity from severalmanufacturers and warehouse the goods for sale.School districts and large institutions purchasetheir products through distributors because theycan buy in volume and it costs less. Small ECEprograms can also purchase products andequipment from distributors by forming buyingcooperatives. Buying cooperatives are formed when groups join together with others for joint purchasing. Acooperative, or co-op, buys and sells products orservices like any other business. The difference isa co-op is owned and governed by its members,the people who use it. They get access to betterproducts and cheaper prices. Buying cooperativesare especially helpful for ECE programs in ruralareas, where costs can be higher, than in urbanareas where there is more competition amongretailers, and delivery costs are lower. Otherbenefits of forming a buying cooperative andpurchasing from a distributor are: u you often get access to a better selection of better quality, safer products, includingnewer products that may not be availableat local retail stores; u dilution stations are often provided for free when enough of a product is purchased; u Safety Data Sheets and pre-printed labels for secondary containers, required for yourHazard Communication Program, areprovided; u distributors often provide better service on delivery and exchanges; u buying cooperative members can share experiences with products and provideadvice to each other; u other products, like food and cleaning services, can be added to the cooperativebuying program, extending the costsavings. Forming a buying cooperative u Before making plans to organize your own purchasing cooperative, find out if anyother cooperatives are available to you.Speak to the school district in your area.Can you join with it to make purchases? u Find other ECE programs who are interested in forming a cooperative. u Contact the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA). NCBA helps developcooperative businesses across the UnitedStates through partnerships withCooperationWorks! - a network of rural co-op development centers - and the UrbanCooperative Development Initiative.

A CS must purchase the right products,but they must also know how, where, and whento use them. A knowledgeable CS can also helpyou create your own green cleaning program.Here are some guidelines that will help you selecta CS: 1. Identify a CS with ECE facility experience. Ask other ECE providers for the names of CSs that are familiar with cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products andpractices that protect human health andthe environment Ask applicant CSs if they have experience working in ECE; do they know the statechild care licensing regulations; and arethey registered and insured? 2. Ask the CSs if they are certified. Are they a certified green CS; if so, by whom, and what is the certificationprocess? 3. Ask what products they use. Are they using cleaning products that are certified by Green Seal, EcoLogo, or Designfor the Environment to be free fromcarcinogens, reproductive toxins,neurotoxins, fragrances, and otheringredients which can cause healthproblems? 4. Find out what equipment they use. Are they using \"greener\" equipment such as HEPA or andmops?5. Ensure that disinfectants used by the CS are registered with the EPA as a hard-surface hospital-grade disinfectant and preferablyapproved by the EPA's Design for theEnvironment Antimicrobial Pesticide PilotProject. The EPA is the only agency that canlegally identify disinfecting products thatare safer for human health and theenvironment. 6. Confirm the CS uses a two-step process (cleaning, then sanitizing or disinfecting) Make sure the CS understands which areas require sanitizing vs. disinfection, andwhen permission is required for use ofmore hazardous chemicals (i.e. applicationof cleaning materials that run a risk ofinhalation hazard). 7. Does the service provide training to its employees? If so, does it cover: Hazard Communications; proper use of products; bloodborne pathogens? 8. Some ways to know your CS is not using a green cleaning program. The cleaning service uses products such as Pine-Sol TM, aerosolized cleaners, scented products, andbleach; does not use microfiber cloths and mops or a split-bucket system; does not ventilate areas during and after cleaning; uses the same cleaning equipment in multiple areas without cleaning orswitching out heads/cloths/etc. does not include recommendations for safer, green-certified cleaning supplies.Green Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Appendix C 57What, Where and How Often to Clean, Sanitize, and Disinfect in ECEGreen Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting: A Toolkit for Early Care and Education Appendix D Areas Before Each Use After Each Use Daily At the End of the Day Weekly Monthly Comments Food preparation surfaces Countertops Food preparation appliances Plastic mouthed toys Pacifiers Hats Door & cabinet handles Floors Machine-washable cloth toys Dress-up clothes Play activity centers Drinking fountainsEating utensils & dishes Tables & high chair traysClean, SanitizeClean, Sanitize Clean Clean CleanClean, Sanitize Clean, Sanitize Clean Clean Clean Clean Clean CleanLaunder LaunderClean, SanitizeClean, Sanitize Clean, Sanitize Clean, Sanitize Clean, Sanitize Clean, Disinfect Clean, DisinfectCleanMixed-use tables RefrigeratorUse a sanitizer safe for food contact Before serving foodClean, SanitizeUse a sanitizer safe for food contact If washing the dishes and utensils by hand, use a sanitizer safe for food contact as the final step in the process; Use of an automated dishwasher will sanitize Reserve for use by only 1 child; use dishwasher or boil for one minute Clean after each use if head lice are present Sweep or vacuum, then damp mop, (consider microfiber damp mop to pick up most particles)FOOD AREAS CHILD CARE AREAS 58Areas Before Each Use After Each Use Daily At the End of the Day Weekly Monthly Comments Computer keyboards Potty chairs Handwashing sinks & faucets Diaper pails Bed sheets & pillow cases Cribs, cots, & mats BlanketsFloorsPhone receivers Changing tablesClean, Sanitize Clean Clean, Disinfect Clean Clean Clean, Clean, DisinfectCountertops ToiletsClean with detergent, disinfect Damp mop with a floor cleaner/ disinfectantClean, DisinfectUse sanitizing wipes, do not use spray Clean before use by another child Clean before use by another childCHILD CARE AREAS SLEEPING AREASTOILET AND DIAPERING AREASAppendices: Appendix D: What, Where and How Often to Clean, Sanitize, and Disinfect in ECE 59Source: American Academy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association, National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care and Early Education. 2011.
