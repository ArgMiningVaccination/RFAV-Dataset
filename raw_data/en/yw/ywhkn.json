Brad Kallmyer, M.D.* INTRODUCTION Custom has generally defined the standard of care in medical malpractice claims against physicians. Nevertheless, commentators and courts have been reluctant to hold the practice of complementary and alternative medicine (\"CAM\") by physicians to be a per se breach of the standard of care even though CAM is by definition not customary. Despite this inconsistency, there has been little discussion and no consensus concerning what the standard of care is or should be for physicians practicing CAM. This Note concludes that a reasonable and prudent physician standard rather than custom better ad\u00ad dresses the complexities of standard of care for physicians practicing CAM. Moreover, informed consent-usually a concept distinct from standard of care -must enter the standard of care analysis for physicians practicing CAM because the patient's consent defines the extent of permissible deviation from the otherwise applicable non-CAM standard. Because this deviation can be defined by the patient, the standard has the potential to be different for two patients with identical medical problems. Individual patient desires notwith\u00ad standing, the physician maintains a duty to abstain from unreasonable prac\u00ad tices. Part I of this Note discusses the background, scope, and complexity of the standard of care issue for CAM physicians. Part ll examines the validity of reasons to look beyond custom as the standard for practitioners of CAM and concludes that CAM warrants an exception to the use of custom as a deter\u00ad minant of standard of care. Part ill addresses the need for an informed consent contract. Part IV analyzes the standard of care for CAM through the lenses of alternative standard of care formulations, addressing some evidentiary and policy issues. This Note concludes that a patient-specific reasonable physician standard best addresses the standard of care difficulties raised by CAM. I.

Serious consideration of CAM by allopathic medicine (\"biomedicine'') followed recognition of the prevalence of CAM use. 2 Even a decade ago, nearly sixty percent of mainstream physi\u00ad cians had referred patients to CAM practitioners. 3 Currently, many physicians provide CAM directly to their patients, obviating the need for referral. Information about CAM now appears commonly in the biomedical literature, and CAM is part of the curriculum in many allopathic medical schools.4 In response to this surge in interest, the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH\") established the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (\"NCCAM'').s NCCAM defines CAM as \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.'><; NCCAM notes that \"[t]he list of what is considered to be CAM changes continually, as those therapies that are proven to be safe and effective become adopted into conventional health care and as new approaches to health care emerge. \"7 CAM practices 1.

(doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by their allied health profes\u00ad sionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. Other terms for conventional medicine include allopathy; Western, mainstream, orthodox, and regull!l\" medicine; and biomedicine. Some conventional medical practitioners are also practitioners of CAM. Id Although osteopathic physicians frequently provide all of the services that a medical doctor provides, osteopathic physicians may provide additional services. \"'steopathic medicine is a form of conventional medicine that, in part, emphasizes diseases arising in the musculoskeletal system .... Some osteopathic physicians practice osteopathic manipulation, a full-body system ofhands-on techniques to alleviate pain, restore function, and promote health and well-being.\" Id 2.

For example, the FDA issued an advisory after the supplement kava was shown to cause liver abnormalities. Letter ftom Christine Lewis Taylor, .. 2005] COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATNE MEDICINE 227 include veda; meditation; prayer; qi gong; and bioelectromagnetic medicine. 8 Further, CAM refers to acupuncture and some medical therapies that appear bio\u00ad medical in nature but are labeled alternative by their practitioners; such as chelation therapy,9 hydrogen peroxide infusion, 10 or ozone therapy.11 From a legal standpoint, the practice of alternative medicine has thus far been primarily an issue for medical licensing boards.12 All states require licen\u00ad sure for chiropractic practice, while many states require licensure to practice acupuncture, homeopathy, naturopathy, or massage therapy.13 Although there are relatively few reported medical malpractice cases involving physicians practicing CAM, an increasing number are likely to emerge as medical plans offer coverage for CAM, 14 the number of physicians offering CAM increases, and potential cases wind their way through often lengthy pre-trial processes. Additionally, the dynamics of the patient-practitioner relationship in CAM practice and the personal characteristics of many CAM practitioners may have contributed to the historically reduced propensity of CAM patients to sue. 15 As a broader constituency of physicians add CAM to their practice repertoire Director, Office ofNutritional Products, Labeling. and Dietary Supplements, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, U.S. Food & Drug Admin., to Health Care Professionals, FDA Issues Consumer Advisory That Kava Products May Be Associated with Severe Liver Injury (Mar. 25, 2002), at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/-dms/ds-ltr29.html Oast visited Apr. 18, 2005) (on file with the Indiana Health Law Review). 8.

The commissioners also noted that \"spirituality transcends any arbitrary designation of conventional and non-conventional medicine and cannot be claimed by any particular group.

Detennination of the standard of care for CAM presents dilemmas and paradoxes. Two have been discussed in the context of Canadian law.16 First,\u00b7 a standard of care paradox is created when a physician providing un\u00ad proven CAM therapy is at the same time generally expected to\u00b7 use only therapy proven to be safe and efficacious.17 Second, courts will be faced with the factual problem of deciding whether the physician-homeopath acted as a physician or as a homeopath . . . . While this may be easily discerned in the case of prescribing a homeopathic solution, other elements of treatment may plausibly be characterized as either medical or homeopathic. In such a situation, should a physician be able \u00b7 to declare that she acted as a homeopath or should the applic\u00ad . able standard be based on the patient's perception?18 Physicians who provide CAM in the United States have yet another problem: in the United States, physicians in most states are held to the standard of prevailing practice or custom as determined by expert witnesses.19 CAM, by definition, is not customary. 16.

This very issue recently arose inBd of Registration for the Healing Arts v. McDonagh, 123 S.W.3d 146, 149 (Mo. 2003) (en bane). In McDonagh, the Board of Registration disciplined osteopathic physician McDonagh based on the physician's uncon\u00ad ventional treatment of vascular disease. /d An Administrative Hearing Commission(\" AHC'') reversed, and this opinion was affirmed by the circuit court. Id The Missouri Supreme Court reversed the circuit court and remanded because the standard of care was not identified, and it appeared that the AHC judged McDonagh's conduct by reference to expert witness physicians using McDonagh's unconventional treatment rather than by reference to the standard of care of physicians treating patients with vascular disease. Id The case also turned on evidentiary issues. See discussion infra Part IV .A.4. 19. See also Philip G. Peters, Jr., The Quiet Demise ofDeference to Custom: Malpractice Law at the Millenium, 51 WASH. & LEE L. REv. 163 passim (2000) (describing the decline of use of custom in favor of reasonableness, and categorizing states by type of standard). See generally BARRY R. FuRROW ET AL., HEALlH LAW \u00a7 6-2 (2d ed. 2000). Generally, under the nationat\u00b7custom standard of care, a physician must conform to the practices that have become customary in the profession nationally, with allowable local variation in care based on resource availability. 2005] COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE ll. SHOULD ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE EvER BE WITHIN THE STANDARD OF CARE? 229 Any discussion of standard of care for the CAM physician must~addreSs the frequently cited issue raised by a New York court in Charell v. Gonzalez: \"[l]t would seem that no practitioner of alternative medicine could prevail ... as the reference to the tenn 'non-conventional' may well necessitate a finding that the doctor who practices such medicine deviates from 'accepted' medical standards. \"20 For a number of reasons, however, non-conventional care should not necessarily be considered deviant or unacceptable. A. Patient Autonomy Patient autonomy provides the most compelling argument for acceptance of physicians' incorporation of CAM into their practices. Biomedical pater\u00ad nalism has steadily eroded from the time of Cardozo's landmark opinion in Schloendotffv. Society of the New York Hospita/.21 With the erosion of the physician's ability to dictate the patient's treatment, the biomedical pro\u00ad fession's ability to dictate what is considered acceptable treatment has likewise eroded. Quoting Schloendorff, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit made this explicit in Schneider v. Revici: [W]e see no reason why a patient should not be allowed to make an informed decision to go outside currently approved medical methods in search of an unconventional treatment. While a patient should be encouraged to exercise care for his own safety, we believe that an informed decision to avoid surgery and conventional chemotherapy is within the patient's right ''to determine what shall be done with his own body. \"22 20. Cbarell v. Gonzalez, 660 N.Y.S.2d 665, 668 (N.Y. Ct. N.Y. Hosp . 105 N.E. 92,93 (N.Y. 1914), overruled on other grounds by Bing v. Thunig. 143 N.E.2d3, 9 (N.Y. 1957). The court noted that a surgeon operating without patient consent is not merely negligent, but is committing an assault. 22. Schneiderv. Revici, 817 The ''patient has the right to make decisions regarding the health care that is recommended by his or her physician.\" Jd (emphasis added). This implies a greater degree of control by the physician over the \u00b7direction of treatment. 230 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2:225 The White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy 3 extended this position in its recommendation that indivi\u00ad duals participate \"in all aspects of their care, including the development of new research agendas.\"24 Thus, individuals are not only permitted to deter\u00ad mine what is done to their own bodies, but are also encouraged to participate in ch~sing which therapies should be available to the public at large.25 1. The Changing Nature of the Physician-Patient Relationship\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 The increasingly collaborative nature of the physician-patient relation\u00ad ship involves physicians in the CAM choices of their patients whether physicians desire this role or not. The NIH urges patients to be informed and to \"take charge of [their] health,\" but adds that patients should involve their primary care doctor in the treatment plan for their safety.26 This implies the reciproCal: that primary care doctors be involved in their patients' decisions to seek CAM treatment. Furthermore, as part of its five-year strategy, NCCAM sees integration of CAM as a necessary part of\"an expanded repertoire of safe and effective treatments that include a focus on the whole person. \"27 One NCCAM goalis to ''work to overcome the reluctance of conventional health\u00ad care providers to consider CAM therapies for their patients.\"28 This reluctance is implied in the American Medical Association (\"AMA\") Principles of 23. The White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy was created by President Clinton and Congress in 2000 with the mandate of developing \"legislative and administrative recommendations that would help public policy maximize potential benefits, to consumers and American health care, of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies . . \" James S. Gordon, Chairman's V'ISion, WHITE HousE CoMM'N, supra note 4, at x. 24. ld. at xii (emphasis added). 25. Public participation in developing research agendas seems to go beyond autonomy. When individuals participate in determining what is to be provided (or not provided) to the rest of society, the participation becomes political. Indeed, many current issues in medicine have become politicized. The examples of fetal stem cell use and partial birth abortion illustrate the capability of political processes to control the availability of medical treatment. Broad popular opinion, based on numerous factors in addition to science, drives legislation and funding decisions. 26.

Be that as it may. the standard of care is defined in the here-and-now and cannot be based upon speculation about care in the future anymore than it can continue to accept past standards that have lost their support through scientific progress. When confronted with the argument that an alternative treatment may one day be accepted, one court responded succinctly that \"the Court does not have a crystal ball.\" Moore v. Baker, No. 491-93, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14712, at *15 (S.D. Ga. Sep. 5, 1991). 28. HORIZONSOFHEALTHCARE,supranote 5, at 15. 2005] COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 231 Medical Ethics, which add that the \"physician has an obligation to cooperate in the. coordination of medically indicated care.\"29 Here, the Principles of Medical Ethics preserve the physician's ability to exclude therapies unilaterally through the definition of medically indicated care. Despite the paternalistic bias of this section of the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics, the Principles otherwise roughly conform to modern consen\u00ad sus in acknowledging that the doctor-patient relationship has progressed from being merely consensual to collaborative.30 The physician is urged to seek \"common ground\" with the patient, so both doctor and patient are involved in the decision-making process. 31 Finding common ground may require physi\u00ad cian concession to reasonable patient requests for treatment outside of bio\u00ad medicine. .This give-and-take negotiating, in which a physician considers (or proposes) CAM at an early stage in treatment, opens communication and thus strengthens the doctor-patient relationship. 32 Improved communication is likely to facilitate patient acceptance of conventional treatment if it is clearly safer and more efficacious or if an attempted CAM treatment is ultimately unsuccessful. 33 Patients undergoing CAM at the direction of a physician can have the benefit of the physician's diagnostic and prognostic skills even if they are not undergoing optimal treatment by conventional standards. 34 2. Cultural Minorities, Indigenous People and CAM Biomedicine is at least to some degree ethnocentric. 35 The names alone of many CAM modalities reveal an origin outside of Western European tradition. Existing biomedical standards may be in place not because they are superior, but because biomedicine was already entrenched when proponents of a competing practice arrived on the scene, 36 or because biomedicine 29.

For example, Navajo methods of treatment have the potential for use in therapeutic jurisprudence, approaching crime \"as an opportunity for healing rather than retribution and punishment.'\"'5 Obviously, if this means of rehabilitation were to be employed, practitioners (potentially physicians) would need to be trained in its use. Thus, loss of alternative treatments may have wider consequences than the mere lost chance to treat individuals. 37.

Regulatory Limitation of Patients' Treatment Options Autonomy-based arguments for a libertarian approach to treatment not\u00ad withstanding, the physician is not completely unbridled in granting' patient requests; various regulatory bodies may curb a physician's scope of practice. The Supreme Court has held that it is within the police power of the state to regulate physician's licensure46 and therapies that the physician mayprovide.47 Indeed, ''there is no right to practice medicine which is not subordinate to the police power of the States. >4s Some aspects of medicine such as education (through licensure requirements for specific professions), human experimenta\u00ad tion, and use of controlled substances are heavily regulated. 49 However, regu\u00ad lation of specific therapies is sparse. 50 Allowing a physician latitude in treat\u00ad ment is probably wise policy: government-imposed standards could potentially mandate unsubstantiated treatment or preclude progress if a previously prohibited treatment were found to be beneficial when used in a different manner or within a different context 51 States have used their police powers in recent years to limit the ability of physicians in some jurisdictions to practice CAM. For example, in In re Guess, the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed lower court rulings and upheld a medical licensing board decision to revoke Guess' medical license because he practiced a limited amount of homeopathic medicine. sz Discount\u00ad ing that Guess' treatment presented no threat of harm to his patients or to the public, and further discounting that Guess' practices were allowed in other jurisdictions, the court based its decision solely on Guess' deviation from ''the 46.

However, scrutiny has also been directed at specific practices collateral to delivery of medical care, such as marketing. The White House Commission noted that \"misleading and fraudulent health claims exist and are a cause for great concern.'' 54 Especially susceptible to these fraudulent claims of efficacy are those \"who are ill, have limited language or educational skills, or lack access to the conventional health care system .... \"55 These unsubstantiated claims of efficacy have triggered Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") action. For example, the FTC investigated the advertis\u00ad ing and promotion of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (\"EDTA\") by the American College for the Advancement of Medicine (\"ACAM'') as an effec\u00ad tive treatment for atherosclerosis.56 Because the claim of efficacy was not supported by research, the FTC found ACAM's promotion of EDT A therapy false and misleading. 57 The FTC noted that m the health care field, \"the con\u00ad sequences of deception can be especially serious, causing not only economic injury by undermining consumers' ability to make informed choices, but creating risks to consumer health and safety.''58 Although the FTC notes that its ruling applies only to \"commercial speech, disseminated to consumers[,]\" and not to \"doctors acting in their individual capacities giving advice to [or treating] their patients\",59 the ruling may chill physicians' enthusiasm for the use ofEDTA chelation therapy. 60 Thus, potentially unlimited patient demands, legitimatized by patients' recognized right of autonomy, are balanced by regulation and pressure from professionally controlled bodies such as licensing boards that may confine physicians' scope of practice.

The Conundrum ofTaxonomy Probably the most radical argument supporting CAM suggests, with pos\u00ad sible irony, that biomedicine could be considered a subset of energy medicine (CAM) based on issues of legitimacy, precedence, and priority of beliefs. 62 However, it is unlikely that the American health care establishment will ever accept this theory. CAM practitioners are more properly considered to be operating within a separate paradigm from biomedicine, although the boun\u00ad daries of the paradigms are sometimes far from distinct.63 Philosophers of science would probably conclude that neither paradigm is likely to be explic\u00ad able in terms of the other. 64 This precludes either CAM or biomedicine subsuming the other. 61.

As noted in Part II.C.l, infra, until scientists have nothing further to discover, biomedicine's scientific explicability must be qualified as incom\u00ad plete, so lack of explicability alone is insufficient to invalidate the use of any broad category of therapy. Going further, schools that are so different that they are inexplicable in mutual tenns may require judgment by different stand\u00ad ards.76 C. Arguments Against a Standard of Care for CAM Arguments against a standard permitting non-customary treatment tend to be more formalistic or based upon collateral concerns. 1. Standard of Care Should Be Professionally Determined and Science-Based Because simply being reasonable and prudent supplies an inadequate basis upon which to make a good decision in a highly complex and technical field,. medical professionals are not held to the standard of ordinary care that applies in most tort law. Physicians are expected to apply specialized know\u00ad ledge that neither the ordinary reasonable person nor the patient possesses. Paternalism, whether good or bad, is inevitable whenever decision-making power and responsibility is allocated in proportion to knowledge in the pre\u00ad sence of gross information asymmetry. 77 Relying upon the profession to deter\u00ad mine its own standards and protecting the integrity of the profession through medical licensing laws probably results in a higher standard of care. 78 Allow- 75. !d. 76.

In contrast to paternalism's usual negative connotation, it may be characterized positively as consumer protectionism in the relationship between physician and patient. See Boozang, supra note 35, at 211. Regulation ofhealth care through a state's police powers for consumer protection is also paternalism. Id. 78. Hayne E.

From the premise that the medical profession is distinguished by its specialized knowledge may \u00b7rise the belief that standard of care should\u00b7 not include any inexplicable treatment. 80 CAM may be viewed as transcending mere inexplicability and entering the realm of religion or faith, rather than medicine.81 Some fields, such as energy healing, do not fit neatly into either school. 82. Allowing non-professional appendages to the standard corrupts its protection of consumers from charlatans. Eyen the White House Commission, a strong CAM advocate, expressed concern that recognition of and demand for treatment should not preempt a rigorous standard: [M]ost CAM modalities have not yet been scientifically studied and found to be safe and effective.

The Commission believes that conventional and CAM systems of health and healing should be held to the same rigorous standards of good science.83 In Gambee v. Board of Medical Examiners of the State of Oregon, the defendant Board applied the principles ofboth scientific purism and protection of professional integrity in making its decision to revoke the medical license of John Gambee, an allopathic physician who provided ozone therapy to a patient: Alternative methods of treatment are available from alterna\u00ad tive providers. When a patient goes to a Medical Doctor or a Doctor of Osteopathy, he or she is entitled to presume that the physician will practice pursuant to scientific, orthodox principles. One of those principles is that unproven or un\u00ad scientific therapies will not be provided, even for the best of motives, because of the risk of exploitation. Dr. Gambee's use of Ozone with patient D.B., and his rationale for it, [that it would be harmless for a tenninal patient,] is not dissimilar to the use of Laetrile. Patients in these conditions are extre\u00ad mely vulnerable to offers of hope of any kind from anybody for any price . . . . The principle is that the modality be scientifically based and justifiable. This Board must protect that principle and the principle will protect the population. 84 During the course of Dr. Gambee' s litigation, the Oregon legislature amended the Unprofessional Conduct Statute-under which the Board had revoked Gambee' s license-to provide that ''the use of an alternative medical treatment shall not by itself constitute unprofessional conduct. .as Because the Board had additional grounds upon which to revoke Gambee's license, the court did not need to enter into what would have been a very interesting standard of care analysis to determine whether Gambee's provision of unconventional treatment no longer required prevention. 86 When viewed from a practical rather than formalist standpoint, however, the Board's concerns in Gambee diminish considerably, especially if lack of scientific basis for treatment is disclosed to the patient Moreover, the asser\u00ad tion that medicine is \"scientific\" may be overstated.

Efficacy of a CAM treatment may be proven before a physiologic basis is discovered, 87 and even lack of proof of efficacy is not necessarily sufficient to prove that a treatment is not bene\u00ad ficial.88 Notably, some CAM treatments are equal in efficacy to biomedical treatments that have potentially greater risk. For example, efficacy of spinal manipulation is similar to that of biomedical management of uncomplicated back pain;89 however, spinal manipulation does not entail the significant potential adverse effects of anti-inflammatory and pain pharmaceuticals. 90 Biomedicine likewise has a history of providing some minimally bene\u00ad ficial \"treatments'' in response to popular demand. Male circumcision is an obvious example. Although the procedure is generally not performed for reasons of medical necessity and has been performed for generations by non\u00ad physicians, there is nevertheless a standard of care for its execution.91 Another example is the requirement in some states that tattooing be performed by or under the supervision of a physician-a bizarre co-optation of a non-medical practice by medicine (or an assignment of the duty by state legislature ).92 87. While poorly understood from the standpoint of biomedicine, acupuncture is apparently effective as treatment for cocaine addiction. See HORIZONS OF HEALTHCARE, supra note 5, at 9 (citing S.

Economic Factors In the interest of stewardship of funds, the scope of reasonable and necessary medical treatment covered by insurance is usually confined to efficacious treatments in order to maximize the benefit of money spent on health care. Since most of CAM is of unproven efficacy, it follows that CAM should not be covered 93 While this conclusion strongly disfavors requiring third party reimbursement for CAM, applying this argument more-broadly reveals the argument's limited applicability. Subjecting all medical treatments to a cost-benefit test to determine whether a treatment is within the standard of care raises difficulties in the analysis of nearly cost-free CAM modalities and extremely expensive heroic treatments. D. Conclusion When \"balanced against the wish to grant patients every opportunity to access healing, alleviate suffering, and move toward wholeness at every level of being,'>94 arguments that CAM necessarily resides outside the scope of physicians' permissible practice and is essentially malpractice per se seem weak. Although absolute exclusion of CAM from permissible treatment may protect some consumers who would otherwise obtain less effective treatment, if CAM is not malpractice per se, the consumer still has the protection of medical malpractice law if injured by CAM, and the physician must still practice within the loose confines of state regulation. Allowing the practice of CAM may provide opportunities for innovation, may strengthen the rela\u00ad tionship of trust and respect between patients and physicians, and is in step with emerging concepts of autonomy. Allowing biomedical physicians to practice CAM may encourage some patients that would not otherwise seek conventional care, but need it, to enter the system. Permitting CAM preserves practices that may have a broader cultural value. Lastly, a standard of care must emerge for physicians practicing CAM because, in a sense, the horse is already out of the barn. Patients, courts, pro\u00ad fessional societies, and governmental ~cies and commissions expect physi\u00ad cians to provide, or at least coordinate, CAM services. In response to these demands, as well as their own perception of appropriate medicine, physicians are providing the services and are being reimbursed.

COHEN, supra note 27, at 18. 2005] COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 243 is a per se breach of standard of care because it is distinct from customary, traditional biomedicine seems inadequate in this light. ill. INFORMED CONSENT \u00b7 While informed consent and standard of care are generally distinct con\u00ad cepts, informed 9onsent is critical to the standard of care analysis for CAM physicians. [D]isclosure is rooted in patient autonomy and is character\u00ad ized by an exchange of material information between physi\u00ad cian and patient such that the patient can make an informed health care decision. In contrast, standard of care refers to the physician's exercise of reasonable care in the treatment of a patient and is characterized by the alleviation of patient suffering through the employment of physical and pharmaco\u00ad logical means supported by professional custom and exper\u00ad ience. Standards of care are developed from within profes\u00ad sions and, consequently, acceptable practices vary among the conventional and unconventional healing arts.95 Informed consent must assume a greater role in CAM than in conventional practice because CAM involves a much greater degree of patient participation in directing and conducting treatment-for example, through nutrition, medita\u00ad tion, and exercise--than in conventional medicine.96 Because in many cases results are not judged by quantifiable, biomedical standards, there may be no clear indication of treatment success or failure, so success or failure must be judged subjectively. 97 Informed consent in CAM must not only address the items traditionally included in informed consent, 98 but must also address the question of who is to judge treatment success, and, derivatively, which para\u00ad meters determine whether therapy is to be continued or discontinued.99 The type of consent necessary for CAM, setting forth which decisions are to be made by the physician, which by the patient, and which are to be made 95.

Green, supra note 30, at 89-93. 244 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2:225 joiD.tly, 100 is therefore more in the nature of a contract than informed consent would be in the case of conventional treatment. A. Contract Issues Defining duty through contract is nothing new. Furthermore, in applica\u00ad tion of the assumption of risk doctrine, there is precedent for application of a contractual definition of duty in CAM medical malpractice cases.101 The collaborative nature of the physician-patient relationship in CAM makes the importation of contractual concepts less problematic in some respects than it would be in the case of conventional, more paternalistic, medi\u00ad cine. Moreover, because the medical profession controls standard of care both in tort law and through its influence on licensing and state medical board actions, it is largely self-regulatory and is ideally situated to provide the para\u00ad meters and boundaries of contract concerning type of care. 102 Several lines of arguments support allowing contractual definition of standard of care through an informed consent document. First, the contract respects autonomy because limitations on treatment in part constitute patient refusal of conventional care, rather than physician dictation of CAM. That a physician's acceptance of this refusal is not contrary to public policy has some well accepted precedent: policy favors honoring Jehovah's Witnesses' express refusal ofblood even when refusal threatens the individual's life and receiving 100. Id at 89; see also Havighurst, supra note 78, at 428-29. The author also notes a potential economic benefit of determining standard of care through contract: [P]roviders and consumers could come to their own arrangements with respect to how the risks of medical treatment should be borne. Not only might parties to such contracts redefine their respective rights and responsibilities in the event of an injury, but they might also redefine the standard of care by specifying parti\u00b7 cular services that a patient would or would not be entitled to receive. Id. at428. 101. See Schneider v. Revici. 817 F.2d 987, 989 (2d Cir. 1987) (holding that express assumption of risk was available as a total defense in the case of a physician providing non-con\u00ad ventional cancer treatments) (emphasis 1060, from jury); supra note 78, at 429. Havighurst questions \"[ w]hether courts would respect contractual alterations of consumers' tort and other rights .... \" Id Apparently some courts are willing to consider it. 102, Some state legislatures have enacted statutes permitting such use of contract and man\u00ad dating inclusion of certain provisions. See, e.g., IND. CODE ANN. \u00a7 25-22.5-1-2.1 (West 2004). The patient may consent to nonconventional treatment if(1) a physician personally examines and agrees to treat the individual, (2) the risk of the treatment is not unreasonable or significant, and (3) written and oral informed consent is obtained which discloses the nonconventional nature of the treatment, the unapproved status of any drugs or devices used, and the material risks of the treatment's side effects.

Third, public policy, general tort law and general contract law will still provide boundaries to protect health care consumers. For example, CAM physicians will not be able to enforce contracts of adhesion, contract out of negligent behavior, or enforce contracts that violate federal or state law.104 \u00b7 1. Documentation of Refusal of Conventional Treatment While infonned consent of some sort is usually required before provision of medical treatment, if the treatment is unproven or has been shown to be less effective than the conventional treatment, the consent assumes additional importance. lnfonned consent would show not only that the patient chose a less efficacious or proven therapy, but also that the patient specifically refused the more efficacious or proven treatment with knowledge of the risks. The document is a necessary part of a communication and educational tool that makes doctor and patient expectations explicitly and clearly delineated.105 The consent fonn should demonstrate that the patient was indeed infonned of the conventional treatment, its benefits, and perceived superiority over the CAM treatment, as well as any hann that may come to the patient by foregoing the conventional treatment. Furthennore, the infonned consent document should expressly descnoe the treatment plan to set the expectations ofboth the physi\u00ad cian and patient. In 2002, the House of Delegates of the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States approved Model Guidelines for the Use of Com\u00ad plementary and Alternative Therapies in Medical Practice (\"Model Guide\u00ad lines\"), developed by its Special Committee for the Study of Unconventional Health Care Practices.106 Two of the committee's goals were to \"protect legiti- 103.

If a competent, adult patient, being fully informed as to all the pros and cons of a particular treatment, nevertheless elects to go ahead with the treatment, then where is the harm? The state has fulfilled its legal duty to insure safe and effective medical care by requiring full disclosure to the patient. The physician is pro\u00ad tected from medical board disciplinary action for the mere use of an alternative or complementary treatment which does not meet the generally accepted standard of care. The patient has autonomy and the physician has medical freedam. 110 This advice has been implemented to a limited extent: Missouri has promul\u00ad gated a consent document specifically for provision of EDTA chelation therapy of\"no medical or osteopathic value ...... m 2. Definition of the School of Practice and of the Expectations of the Parties Informed consent is the most reasonable solution to the physician\u00ad homeopath as physician or homeopath dilemma discussed above. 112 Because practice and standard of care vary among the biomedical and the numerous CAM schools, the school must be defined prior to treatment so that both doctor and patient know which standard applies. Several courts have noted that when a patient calls upon a physician for treatment, it is the patient that has chosen the school of practice, and the 107. Id 108. Id \u00a7 m.L 109. Glenn E.

This acknowledges that CAM creates an exception to the Usual formulation of standard of care, and that proof of the exception must be shown (with burden of proof on the physician) before it can be invoked. B. Informed Consent Does Not Excuse Physicians from the Duty to Exercise Sound Judgment or the Duty to Refer Documentation that the patient desires CAM treatment exclusively does not immunize the CAM physician from liability for exercising unsound judg\u00ad ment. In Kelly v. Carroll, the Washington Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff when a drugless practitioner prescribed castor oil, pineapple juice treatments and abdominal massage for appendicitis.114 The court reasoned that \"[a] knowledge of what not to do may, in some instances, be indispensable to the patient's safety.\"m A CAM methodology may not be applied in the wrong context. The Kelly court reasoned: While it is true that a [ drugless] practitioner ... is not, in his limited field, required to be an insurer of results any more than a doctor of medicine, still, if he steps out of his limits and undertakes to treat a disorder for which, in the highest level of medical science, there is a generally recognized treat\u00ad ment, such interloper must be held accountable to the accepted standard of treatment.116 113. Van Siclde v. Doolittle, 169 N.W. 141, 142 (Iowa 1918). The court held that objection to testimony of an allopathic physician concerning standard of care in the trial of a homeopathic physician should have been sustained: In calling a physician. a person is presumed to elect that the treatment shall be according to the system or school of medicine to which such physician belongs, and it would be unfair to measure such treatment by any other than the standards of such school; and the law will not tolerate testing treatment according to one school by the standards of another.

Carroll, 219 P. 34, 36 (Wash. 1923) (attaching significance to commonalities of diagnostic training and some portions of treatments of both drugless practitioners and allopathic physicians in the care of patients with appendicitis). 248 INDIANA HEAL Til LAW REviEW [Vol. 2:225 Other states have likewise ruled that an alternative practitioner must recognize when treatment in that practitioner's alternative school will be inef\u00ad fective. 117 Minnesota has gone so far as to require that CAM providers recom\u00ad mend that their clients see a licensed health care provider \"if there is a rea\u00ad sonable likelihood that the client needs to be seen by a licensed or registered health care provider.\"118 Applying this standard only to physicians, the Model Guidelines also recommend that the medical record document ''that proper referral has been offered for appropriate treatment . . . . \"119 Neither the Minnesota statute nor the Model Guidelines require referral, however, so analysis of the applicability of either requires inquiry into reasonable profes\u00ad sional judgment. Thus, both case law and statutes have required that CAM practitioners recognize the limitations of their schools and recommend that patients seek conventional care if indicated. In jurisdictions that adopt a Minnesota-type requirement, the reasoning behind the requirement for non-physician CAM practitioners should logically apply to CAM physicians as well, requiring them to discuss and provide for biomedical treatment if indicated. Thorough docu:tnentation is necessary not only to show that proven treatment or a referral was offered and rejected, but also to show that both physician and patient recognize the risks of pursuing CAM treatment and foregoing biomedical treatment. 120 C. Conclusion Informed consent assumes a broader role in CAM than in conventional medicine. First, because a physician providing CAM services may practice in either of two schools, the school must be identified to establish the expecta\u00ad tions of both provider and patient. Second, because much of CAM is un\u00ad proven, the patient must specifically and expressly refuse treatments shown to be efficacious before the unproven treatment is provided, and the consent should document both risks of CAM treatment and risks of foregoing bio\u00ad medical treatment. Third, contingencies signaling treatment endpoint, failure, or need for referral or change in treatment plan need to be determined up front. Fourth, because the patient may be an active participant rather than a passive recipient in the treatment, the responsibilities of the patient and physician must be delineated. 117. Rosenberg v. Cahill. 492 A.2d 371, 379 (N.J. 1985) (noting that a chiropractor has the duty to recognize tumors on x-rays of a child and refer the child for conventional treatment). 118. MINN. STAT.

If a CAM modality has not been shown to be effective, foregoing biomedical treatment and receiving CAM treatment may amount to receiving no treatment at all. The consent should make this clear. If CAM is provided to augment a biomedical treatment, the consent should make clear what benefit the patient is receiving from the biomedical treatment and from the CAM treatment. 2005] COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 249 IV. STANDARD OF CARE The standard of care imposes a minimum level of acceptable medical service. Although medical treatment may sometimes be obvious malpractice by any standard, 121 medical custom, as defined by the medical profession, generally defines standard of care in medical malpractice.122 However, custom is not the only means by which standard of care can be defined. Comparing the standard of care analyses for CAM using the tests of the alternative stand\u00ad ard of care doctrines illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of each. A. Present Standard of Care Formulations The standard of care as it is currently understood in most jurisdictions evolved from the locality rule, which based standard of care on the prevailing practice or custom of physicians in the same or a similar community.123 The primary criticism of the locality rule was that it exonerated physicians per\u00ad forming to a low local standard and encouraged a conspiracy of silence to protect an incompetent local colleague. 124 1. The National Standard As medical education became uniform across the coun1ry and communi\u00ad ties were no longer isolated from medical progress, a standard of care based upon practices in the locality became antiquated, and a national standard evolved. 125 The standard is national because it is established by experts who are not required to be from a community similar to the defendant physician's 121. In Guerrero v. Smith, 864 S.W.2d 797, 798-99 (Tex. App. 1993), a licensed, self\u00ad styled \"homeopathic\" physician injected a patient with concoction of vitamins. minerals and dimethylsulfoxide in numerous locations without using sterile technique. When the patient developed infection, the doctor refused to prescribe antibiotics but \"told her to drink her morning urine instead.\" Id at 799. 122.

Medical standard of care determined by custom of any sort has increas\u00ad ingly come under attack due to improved dissemination of information and the proliferation of practice guidelines in the past two decades. 128 Courts, while continuing to invoke custom, have placed growing emphasis on reason\u00ad ableness, 129 which has replaced custom as the standard of care in a substantial minority of states.130 Additionally, as the trend toward increasing patient auto\u00ad nomy places more of the decision-making power in the hands of the. patient, custom may lose any remaining relevance because of non-uniformity in patient risk preferences.131 Custom is also dependent upon economic factors that do not have their origin within the profession: treatment is influenced by what is considered economically feasible, 132 as well as by what is covered by insur\u00ad ance,. \"Funktionlust, \"133 the doctor's love of doing (and continuing to do) what the doctor does, and inertia both tend to make practices self-perpetuating, extending the life of customs even though superior treatments might be avail\u00ad able. 134 That custom closely follows the development of new technologies and ideas may also be a myth: the convergence of custom and technological pro\u00ad gress requires an unrealistic assumption of informational homogeneity and 126.

Two Schools of Thought and Respectable Minority Standards\u00b7\u00b7 One response to the observation that physicians do not move in lock-step has been development of the doctrinally similar ''two schools of thought\" and \"respectable minority\" doctrines. These doctrines posit that a practice cari be within the standard of care if it is an accepted alternative manner of treat\u00ad ment.136 At first blush, the two schools of thought standard appears to be ideal with respect to CAM; however, in application it becomes ,problematic. First, the standard is unreasonably advantageous for the defendant physician because it greatly expands the pool in which a defendant may find experts with similar potentially bizarre views, 137 setting the minimum level of care to which a patient is entitled unreasonably low. For example, although EDTA chelation therapy for atherosclerosis has been thoroughly discredited by the biomedical community, an expert in Moore v. Baker estimated that \"approximately one thousand physicians routinely treat occlusive arterial disease with EDTA .... \"138 Alinost any practice, no matter how harmful, en\u00ad gaged in by a considerable number of practitioners could be presented as the standard of care under this formulation.139 135. Henderson & Siliciano, supra note 131, at 1391. 136. Jurisdictions vary widely in the language used to define the standard. For an excellent overview of jurisdictional variation, see Michael Kowalski. Applying the \"Two Schools of Thought\" Doctrine to the Repressed Memory Controversy, 19 J. LEGAL MED. 503, 505-24 (1998). Pennsylvania courts, despite a long experience with two schools of thought doctrine, have struggled with its definition and application. In Jones v. Chidester, 610 A.2d 964, 969 (Pa. 1992), the Pennsylvania supreme court settled long confusion over the doctrine by holding the correct statement oflaw to be: Where competent medical authority is divided, a physician will not be held responsible if in the exercise ofhis judgment he followed a course of treatment advocated by a considerable number of recognized and respected professionals in his given area of expertise. Id. Non-specific terms \"considerable number,\" \"recognized and respected,\" and \"area of expertise\" are all problematic with respect to CAM practitioners. 137. Robert L.

In a sense, this may be criticized as taking the locality standard at its worst and \"simply enlarg[ing] the professional frame of reference.\" King, supra note 133, at 1240-41. 252 INDIANA HEALm LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2:225 While some precedent exists as to the absolute number of physicians necessary to define a minority, 140 defining who should be included in the minority or secondary school is more problematic. Should the minority in\u00ad clude practitioners solely of CAM or dual CAM-biomedicine practitioners? The first group is likely to be large, and the second very small. Moreover, the former does not closely match the characteristics of the defendant physician because its members are generally not considered to have the knowledge and skills of a physician, which has been a key determinant of the non-physician CAM practitioner's standard of care.141 Given the wide range of CAM practices, difficulty also arises in finding a comparable dual practitioner. 142 Even if a practitioner can be found, \"the court may still have trouble discerning a coherent standard of care-one that is somehow distinct from either conven\u00ad tional or alternative medicine-against which to judge the\u00b7 defendant's conduct. \"143 Second, even if the minority can be defined, the difficulty of paradigm still exists. For example, in Mu\"ay v. State Health Benefits Commission, in\u00ad surance coverage of colonic irrigation for treatment of dysbiosis144 was at 140. This number may be significantly less than I 000, which would suggest a very small minority. See, e.g., Leech v. Bralliar, 275 F. Supp 897, 899, 902 (D.

And, therefore, under this ratiorulle, the converse is true, that a treatment will become non-experimental only when tradi\u00ad tional doctors begin prescribing or become supportive of the treatment. 151 The court admonished that in future cases, \"the [ c]ommission should carefully consider whether the 'appropriate specialty' should be alternative Ucensed medical practitioners of the proposed treatment rather than whatevertraditional medical specialty may be related to the treatment. \"152 Whether or not one agrees with the court's reasoning, from a practical standpoint, the court did not change the outcome that would have been obtain\u00ad ed\u00b7 by the commission's reasoning. After apparently opening the door to recognition of the CAM physicians as a respected minority, the col;lrt imme- . diately slammed the door shut by couching the conditions for acceptance of a minority standard in terms that only conventional treatment could fulfill: If a licensed alternative medical provider indicates that the treatment is based on sound medical, biological or scientific principles; widely prescribed and recognized by other alter\u00ad native medical providers; and considered ejjtcacious and safe, the Commission should not reject the treatment solely because traditional doctors do not yet utilize the treatment or are completely unfamiliar with the practice.153 As discussed in Part II, scientific explanation and proof of efficacy generally occur only within. the framework of the biomedical paradigin; which is not the paradigm in which a \"licensed alternative medi~ provider\" operates. Further\u00ad more, the CAM treatment at issue will not, by definition, have a basis in medical, biological, or scientific principles. In determining whether a CAM practice falls within the standard of care under the ''two schools of thought\" doctrine, a trier of fact would experience confusion similar to that of the court in Mu\"ay. Determining whether CAM is an accepted alternative manner of treatment would involve a similar battle of experts speaking from the perspectives of paradigms lacking common\u00ad ality.154 151.

The Reasonable Physician Standard: Best Basis for an Approach to CAM The reasonable physician standard is similar to the accepted practice standard articulated by Professor Joseph K.ing.155 Simply stated, \"[p ]riktices approved by the profession, not necessarily those customarily followed by\u00b7 its members, would be controlling.\"156 This standard provides three advantages when applied to medical malpractice: first, the model would foster a higher standard of care, the \"best standards of the day\"; second, it would be in keep\u00ad ing with use of an \"ideal paradigm\" as a standard; and third, it is less depen\u00ad dent on professional consensus.157 In theory, even an unprecedented practice would be within the standard of care if it were considered sound. 158 The Texas Supreme Court applied a similar standard in Hood v. Phillips. 179 In Hood, a surgeon who had performed carotid body surgery on a patient with emphysema acknowledged that his treatment was not genetally accepted, but that this treatment had been successful in. his hands. 160 Experts testified variously that the procedure had been found ineffectual and aban\u00ad doned, or was potentially harmful. 161 The jury did not find the doctor grossly negligent 162 The court of appeals reversed, finding that an ordinary negli\u00ad gence standard should apply, with the method of treatment supported by a respectable minority.163 The Texas Supreme Court reached the same conclu\u00ad sion on different grounds, concluding that in the case of treatments that are unaccepted-experimental, outmoded, or rejected-the jury should be asked, \"[ d]id the physician undertake a mode or form of treatment which a reasonable and prudent member of the medical profession would not undertake under the same or similar circumstances?\"164 The court further noted that using an unaccepted treatment could show a \"conscious indifference to the welfare\" of the patient and warrant \"submission to the jury of an issue concerning gross negligence and, accordingly, an issue regarding exemplary damages.\"165 The Texas Supreme Court noted that the circumstances juries are to consider may \"include, but are not limited to the expertise of and means avail- 155.

In\u00b7 addressing CAM practice by licensed physicians, the State of Ohio took a similar tack in its statutory treatment of alteinative. medical treatments by including an element of reasonableness in its definition of CAM: \"'alter-: native medical treatment' means care that iS complementary to or different\u00b7 :from conventional medical care but is reasonable when the benefits and risks of the alternative medical. treatment and the conventional medical care are 166. !d. at 165. . . . . . . 167. There is significant overlap of these categories. For example, homeopathic medicine had its origins in a European theory of pathology that \u00b7hld been disproven by sub!!eQuent \u00b7 scientific discovery. $ee Boozang. supra note 35, at 195 (describing the history and theory of homeopathy); see a/sQ Park, supra note 137~ at 578-80 (discrediting homeopathic theory on well-established chemical and mathematical grounds). Use of chelation therapy for athero\u00ad sclerosis could be considered both rejected and outmoded in favor ofless toxic therapies. Many CAM therapies are still undergoing study, while others involving vital energy seem to defy scientific explanation but nonetheless may still be COJ:lSidered:reasonable, especially as adjuncts or in the case of health concerns that have proven intractable to Other treatment. 168.

The Federation of State Medical Boards takes this approach as well. The Model Guidelines state that \"[r]egardless of whether physicians are .using conventional treatments\u00b7 or CAM in their practices, they are responsible for practicing good medicine ... !'171 The Model Guidelines also recommend a balancing of risks and benefits. In evaluating whether a physician is practicing appropriate medicine, boards should aslc whether the treatment is effective and safe; effective, but with some real or potential dangers; inadequately studied, but safe; or ineffective and dangerous. 172 . Under the reasonable physician standard, after finding that a physician's practice was not customary (if relevant) and that a consent document was signed, the inquiry would proceed to whether the practice was nevertheless \u00b7reasonable and prudent under the circumstances. This would entail examining the expertise of physician, health of patient, state of medical knowledge, risk of the treatment, benefit of the treatment, the consent document, and other patient':\"specific factors.that may have influenced the choice of treatment. 4. Evidentiary Concerns Rules of evidence have the potential to loom large in CAM cases .. The expectation is that evidence poorly supported by scientific literature would be .inadmissible; however, whether this is actually the. case is dependent upon jurisdiction. The role of rules of evidence is well illustrated by medical malpraCtice cases in Pennsylvania over the past dozen years. In Gala v. Hamilton, a medical malpractice case not involving CAM, a divided Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the \u00b7standard for admissibility must be highly flexible and may consist solely \u00b7of testimonial evidence without support of scientific literature. 173 Whether the evidence is sufficient to establish a second school of . thought defense is a matter for the jury.174 \u00b7 . Only four\u00b7years previously, the\u00b7 PennSylvania Supreme Court in Com\u00ad monwealth v. Crews had re-affirmed the state court applicability of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Frye v. United States, that \"the thing from \u00b7 which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained 170. OHIO REV. CODE ANN. \u00a7 4731.227 (West 2004). 171.

Me\"ell Dow, which had liberalized the Frye rule.176 Despite its departure from the Supreme Court's decisions in both Daubert and Frye, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's holding in Gala was not necesSarily outrage\u00ad ous; the \u00b7conventional wisdom that juries are easily flummoxed by slick experts may be erroneous.117 Counterintuitively, rules of evidence requiring scientific proof may in \u00b7 some cases benefit the defendant CAM physician because the plaintiffhas the burden of proof. In the post-Daubert case of Ballinger v. Atkins, a low-carbo\u00ad hydrate diet adherent suffered neurologic complaints which his experts, an internist and a biochemist, attributed to excessive use of artificial sweete\u00ad ners.178 Neither expert could adequately support his theory with scientific evidence, so neither was allowed to testify.179 In contrast, the expected outcome did occur in Board of Registration for the Healing Arts v. McDonagh, in which the Missouri Supreme Court grappled with the question of whether Frye, Daubert, or a Missouri statute should apply to admission of scientific evidence in the case of a physician facing discipline for use of EDTA chelation therapy for vascular disease.180 The court noted that even where the Federal Rules of Evidence and the analogous state provision are \"nearly identical,\" the federal construction is not controlling in state court.181 Missouri law required that admissible expert opinion \"be based on facts or data of a type reasonably relied upon by 'experts in the field. \"'182 The court noted further that: The relevant field must be determined not by the approach a particular doctor chooses to take, but by the standards in the field in which the doctor has chosen to practice.

The Board's claim is that Dr. McDonagh engaged in repeated negligence ... in his provision of chelation therapy for these patients. Therefore, the relevant field is doctors treating persons with vascular disease. 183 259 Interestingly, like the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Gala, the Missouri Court did not require that Dr. McDonagh's experts support their views with scientific literature; however, their evidence was nonetheless inadmissible because it was not of the type that would be reasonably relied upon by doctors treating vascular disease. 184 Thus, whether a standard is based on custom or reasonableness, some claims against CAM providers may be dismissed because of the impossibility of providing the scientific evidence needed to establish a prima facie case of malpractice. In a much greater number of claims, there may be little admis\u00ad sible evidence for the CAM physician (at least in jurisdictions adhering to federal rule construction) given that CAM, by definition, is generally not scientifically proven. In other jurisdictions, testimony from CAM experts might be excluded, not because it lacks scientific support, but because it is in a sense not relevant from the perspective of the applicable school (as defined by the court). Courts may also apply a \"flexible\" standard, allowing expert testimony unsupported by scientific literature. B. Other Potential Sources of a Standard All current methods of arriving at a standard of care rely predominantly on the testimony of experts chosen by the parties. Disinterested third parties may also aid in defining the standard. 1. Licensing and Regulation Standard of care can be established through statute; violation of a standard of care mandated by licensing requirements or statute would essen\u00ad tially constitute malpractice per se. Absent a statute, professional discipline by a medical licensing board would create a strong inference that a standard of care has been breached if the discipline is tied to the same conduct that led to the malpractice action.185 One such example is Charell v. Gonzalez, in which a physician treated a terminal cancer patient with coffee enemas and 183. Id. 184. Id. at 156-57. 185. There is. however, a large measure of circularity in the inference; medical licensing boards may also investigate a physician and revoke the physician's license in response to negligence claims. See Glenn E. Bradford, The \"Respectable Mmority\" Doctrine in Missouri Medical Negligence Law, 56 J. Mo. B; 326, 328 (2000). 260 INDIANA HEAL Til LAW REVIEW (Vol. 2:225 monitored the patient's progress with unproven hair tests.186 The plaintiff's claim asserted first negligence, for the doctor's persuading the plaintiff to forego traditional treatment for treatment of no therapeutic value, and second, lack of informed consent.187 The trial court held for the patient and also awarded punitive damages because the physician had a secondary financial interest in the patient's treatment. 188 Except for the award of punitive dam\u00ad ages, the decision was upheld on appeal. 189 The year before his case went to trial, the defendant physician, Gonzalez, had not prevailed on an appeal of an administrative review board's order that he undergo retraining because while ''the vast majority\" of Gonzalez' patients had cancer, he \"lacked the basic understanding of the disease ... .''190 Gonzalez asserted that his patients had all consented to his treatment, and that no. CAM practitiOners were among the panel reviewing his case.191 The court responded: Both the Hearing Committee and the Board recognized that alternative medicine involves a different treatment regime, but held [Gonzalez] to the same standard of care to which all physicians in New York are held . . . . Notably, 'it is well settled that a patient's oonsent to or even insistence upon a certain treatment does not relieve a physician from the obligation of treating the patient with the usual standard of care.'192 This standard and the court's view of the physician-patient relationship are reminiscent of those articulated by the North Carolina Supreme Court in In re Guess.193 Standard of care through regulation offers the advantage of origin in\u00b7 a less adversarial environment than the courtroom. \u00b7 If two apparently incom\u00ad patible concepts must be amalgamated, or one chosen over the other, the infor- 186.

While detennining standard of care through regulation does offer the advantage of certainty, establishing a standard of care by legislative fiat is likely to create the same sort of professional concern that Helling v. Carey created when standard of care was imposed by judicial fiat. 195 Moreover, the White House Commission noted that regulation.through licensure is considered ''not feasible\" for some groups such as Native American and other traditional healers. 196 Other CAM practitioners consider themselves outside the realm ofhealth professionals. 197 Additionally, licensure may stifle the \"subjective, interpersonal and intuitive aspects\" of CAM that make CAM valued by its practitioners and patients. 198 From the patient's perspective, regulation may not necessarily be appre\u00ad ciated as protective, but rather perceived as. unwarranted governmental pater- 194.

Fairness in discussion is the effort to put your case objectively. When an expression of our conviction first comes to our minds it is couched in question\u00ad begging terms. Emotion breaks out uppermost and permeates our whole idea. To be objective we must sort out facts. opinions, and emotions and present them separately, in this order.

But fairness requires this; and also that we ascribe our opponent his troe points, while the limitations of our own knowledge and our natural bias be frankly acknowledged. By tolerance I mean here the capacity to listen to an unfair and hostile statement by an opponent in order to discover his sound points as well as the reason for his errors. It is irritating.to open our mind wide to a spate of specious argument on the off-chance of catching a grain of tiuth in it; which, when aclaiowledged, would strengthen our opponent's position and be even unfairly exploited by him against us.

Standard of care has changed overnight when a previously respected therapy was unexpectedly found to carry significant risk. 201 Determination of standard of care at trial also offers advantages to both plaintiffs and defendants because the particular and probably unique circumstances of the case can be considered. Last, legislative determination of a standard may be viewed as an indirect application of the standard of the biomedical experts which advised it, confounded by special interests and politics. Compounding the confusion, there is no reason to suppose that state standard of care statutes would be uni\u00ad form from state to state. This may have the effect of decreasing uniformity in medical care and education from state to state. The more direct approach of determination of standard of care by the profession itself obviates these problems. 2. Practice Guidelines and Surveys Practice guidelines based on efficacy studies have been useful in. esta\u00ad blishing conventional standards of care and have been available in the past as affirmative malpractice defenses in some jurisdictions.202 Practice guidelines are of limited utility when evaluating CAM, which, as CAM's name suggests, stands in: contraposition to the treatment conformity sought through application of guidelines. Moreover, guidelines are developed through compilation of the results of large scientific studies; CAM has not yet received this level of scientific scrutiny. 199.

Surveys of physicians used to establish a standard of care, when the results are presented by experts, have been admissible in court; however, random sampling may not find doctors familiar with CAM, and the technique has recognized drawbacks when applied to minority views.206 C.

Congress recognized a patient's right to seek civil damages in the courts if there should be evidence of malpractice, and declined to provide any legislative restrictions upon the medical profession.211 Thus, a physician may use FDA approved medications in an unapproved manner at the physician's (and perhaps patient's) peril, with an understanding that authoriZation to use th~ medications in an unapproved manner does not immunize the physician from malpractice claims if the standard of care is violated. Similarly, in State Board of Medical Examiners v. \u00b7Rogers, the Florida Supreme Court held that a physician may use EDTA for chelation therapy, reasoning that the restraint of the use of EDTA \"was an arbitrary and unrea\u00ad sonable exercise of the state's police power. \"212 The court overruled the Board of Medical-Examiners, which had found that EDTA \"chelation therapy can best be classified as investigational, that it more likely can be classified as quackery, and that its use outside a controlled environment such as a research institute fails to conform to acceptable and prevailing medical practice.\"213 In 1989, the FDA listed EDT A treatmentasoneofthenation's \"Top 10 Health Frauds,\" lending additional credence to the medical boards' stance in Evers and Rogers.214 Nevertheless, iri the case of EDT A, non-malpractice common law and statutory construction have permitted broader use than had been considered within the standard of care as determined by the medical pro\u00ad fession and, later, the FDA itself.

While violating a specific statutory prohibition creates a reasonable inference of a violation of the standard of care, failing to limit treatments to those approved by the FDA and medical licensing boards creates a weaker inference. V. CONCLUSION Malpractice claims involving CAM challenge the use of custom in deter\u00ad mining standard of care. Requiring adherence to custom has the theoretical effect of making the practice of CAM a per se breach of the standard of care. Patient autonomy; preservation of valuable cultural practices, and existence of other avenues for consumer protection present compelling arguments that the inevitability of this result is undesirable and that an alternative to custom should be sought. Whatever the standard of care formulation, a decision to approve CAM practices necessarily entails a decision to reject a purely scientific basis for treatment. The reasonable and prudent physician standard offers an alternative to custom without the fatal flaws of other standard of care formulations. The standard is also consistent with the trend of state tort law toward application of a professional reasonableness standard rather than a customary practice standard. Because standard of care may differ depending on whether reasonable\u00ad ness is defined from the perspective of biomedicine or CAM, any offering of CAM should be accompanied by augmented informed consent that expressly documents whether treatment will be biomedical or CAM, that sets the expec\u00ad tations of both physician and patient, and that identifies risks of obtaining and foregoing both CAM and biomedical treatments. Absent informed consent, the reasonable treatment should be presumed to be biomedical, for without justification, there would be no reason to offer a treatment that has not been proven safe and efficacious. Informed consent for CAM should be more in the nature of a contract than typical informed consent, and should be crucial to definition of the physician's duty. Because such a contract is unlikely to be boilerplate, the reasonableness standard based on duties defined in this contract would be patient-specific. The boundaries of permissible care can be defined by legislatures and may co-exist with a reasonableness standard. This approach offers the advant\u00ad ages of certainty and origin in a less adversarial environment than the courts, but has the disadvantages of slow response to innovation and a high likelihood of state to state variability. Adoption of the Model Guidelines and other mea\u00ad sures to increase uniformity in education and licensure requirements can remedy these issues. States may also protect consumers by adoption of informed consent templates or guidelines for CAM practices. . . . . '. "}
