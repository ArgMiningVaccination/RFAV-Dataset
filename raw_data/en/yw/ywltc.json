The U.S. Department of Labor apprenticeship programs allow ICI program participants to earn vocational certificates as a Baker, Office Administrator, Cabinetmaker, Furniture Finisher, Furniture Upholsterer, Machine Set-up Operator, Machinist, Metal Fabricator, Meat Butcher, Graphic Designer, and Animal Trainer. Their participation in these programs give individuals in custody valuable work experience and provide many necessary products for the operation of the State of Illinois' government departments. In FY22, ICI incorporated simulation training and gardening as part of the programs offered to individuals in custody. ICI implemented 13 Caterpillar Excavator training simulators in eight ICI shops. Individuals in custody can complete curriculum-based education supplemented by simulator training hours to earn a heavy equipment operator certificate. Additionally, ICI initiated a state-wide gardening program. Participants learn cultivation methods and techniques while producing staple vegetables for preparation in the facility dietary departments. ICI programing allows individuals in custody to learn valuable skills and experience while earning day for day Earned Program Sentence Credit. These credits afford individuals the opportunity to return to society sooner and put the learned skills to work as successful citizens. Investigations and Intelligence Investigations Unit During FY22, the Investigations Unit restructured how institutional investigative assignments are filled. During this process, safeguards to equal opportunity for staff were implemented. Anytime a vacancy arose at a facility, the warden posted the vacancy institution wide, and it was presented during all three shift's roll call. Staff were given a time period to submit a letter of interest and their resume for the vacancy. The interested staff were interviewed and given the opportunity to provide a writing sample. This enabled staff to show their qualification for the position and gave everyone the opportunity to do so. In addition to the interview and writing sample, staff's disciplinary history, timesheets, and yearly evaluations were reviewed. After a total review of all information, the most qualified candidate was submitted for a background and with the warden and Chief of Investigations approval, placed into the vacancy. Ultimately, a revamp of the Institutional Investigative Assignments Directive was proposed and later approved for dissemination. As part of the Intelligence Unit's strategic plan, an idea was formulated to go beyond traditional identifying of security threat group affiliates and create a system to identify which affiliates are the most active. As a result, a leveling system was generated, which places individuals in custody in specific levels, 1-5, based only on the individuals' actions inside the department within the last three years. The system utilizes data from the individual's disciplinary and STG history and places a level on individuals that increases as their negative behavior increases. The data is currently trending to show that our most active STG affiliates (Levels 3 and 4) account for 12 percent of our population but are responsible for 27 percent of the tracked disciplinary reports. The STG Committee Policy was also created in FY22. The policy outlines the creation of STG committees inside each facility that will be comprised of key assignments where STG activity is known to occur. The committee meets monthly to discuss identifying current trends, patterns and make recommendations to aid in preventing future STG activity. The committee also aids in the creation and flow of intelligence for the facility Intelligence staff to evaluate. The result of the committee and the added teamwork inside the facility will result in less STG activity and a safer environment for both staff and individuals in custody. During FY22, the Investigations and Intelligence Unit restructured the 40-hour investigator training and the Basic Intelligence Officer Training. This provided opportunity for new investigators to gain interactive training, break into small groups, meet, and ask questions of command staff, and ultimately gain a complete investigative overview for their newly obtained assignments. The Intel Officer Training was expanded to a 40-hour course and provided additional hands-on training and more detailed Security Threat Group training.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report7During FY22, the Intelligence Unit implemented the use of a balancing system that allows staff on the statewide level to make comparisons between facilities and ensure that the overall balance of STG affiliates is as proportionally equal as possible to avoid overloads of specific STGs in one facility. This same tool is utilized by each individual institution to ensure that the STG balance within the living units is proportional. For FY22, the Intelligence Unit conducted over 31,000 interviews and monitored over 210,000 phone calls. Additionally, they conducted over 5,000 cell searches and over 3,000 common area searches, the searches resulted in the discovery of approximately 1,700 items of contraband. The Intelligence Unit completed 9,165 advisories, with 49 percent (4,473) being proactive intelligence gathering. Through the Intelligence Center, 3,946 requests from outside law enforcement agencies were filled, which includes coordinating the interviews of individuals by outside agencies. On 173 occasions, the Intelligence Unit provided information of criminal activity to outside agencies. In FY22, the Investigations Unit developed and implemented a case management system which is used to track progress of Departmental investigations. The process aims to bring more accountability to the External Investigations Unit. Preliminary results of the implementation of case management does indicate increased efficiency in the completion of Departmental investigations. During FY22, all administrative directives pertaining to the Investigations & Intelligence Division were reviewed and many were modified to lead to increased accountability and efficiency within the Division. Lastly, during FY22, the Investigations Unit completed 315 investigations including 50 criminal investigations. The Internal Affairs Units completed 2,738 investigations including 170 criminal investigations. Office of Administrative Directive Standards The Office of Administrative Directive Standards is comprised of a manager, three Regional Coordinators, and an Executive I. The Office is responsible for conducting annual reviews of policies and procedures at all facilities and adult transition centers. During a typical fiscal year, select trained and experienced team members from throughout IDOC perform, under the direction of the assigned Regional Coordinator, external reviews at each of the Department's adult facilities. The reviews are conducted to gauge compliance with existing Departmental Rules, Administrative Directives, and Institutional Directives at each individual facility. The External review process was relaunched in July 2021 under the newly revised review process. 60 standards were selected to be reviewed, and this review was accomplished in three days per the revised policy. All facilities completed their external review in FY21 and were also slated for follow up reviews, these reviews occurred approximately 6 months after the initial review to allow time for corrective action by the facilities to take place. A notable improvement was observed at all facilities during their follow up review. After successfully accomplishing our goal of the initial accreditation for Pinckneyville Correctional Center in November 2020, three additional facilities were announced for initial accreditation in 2021. The three facilities selected were Kewanee Life Skills Re-Entry Center, Illinois River Correctional Center, and Centralia Correctional Center. Kewanee Life Skills Re-Entry Center was slated for October 4-6, 2021 and was rewarded for their effort put towards the preparation for ACA with a score of 100 percent on the Mandatory Standards and Non- Mandatory Standards. Illinois River successfully achieved their initial accreditation October 18-20, 2021 with a score of 100 percent on the Mandatory Standards and 97.8 percent on the Non-Mandatory Standards. After pursuing the appeal process on the Non-Compliant Non-Mandatory Standards, the final score was increased to 99.3 percent on Non-Mandatory Standards. Centralia Correctional Center was scheduled to go through the initial accreditation on November 8-10, 2021, but this was postponed due to contractual staffing issues with the health care vendor and has not reached acceptable levels to successfully complete the initial accreditation as of this report. The two contractual Adult Transition Centers being North Lawndale and Crossroads remain ACA compliant, bringing our total facilities accredited to five. As the facilities were selected to go through initial ACA Accreditation for FY22, the process was revised and updated with information we gained during each accreditation during FY21 to make the process easier and more user friendly for the facilities to achieve their initial Accreditation. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report8Office of Constituent Services During FY22, the Constituent Services Unit received more than 16,000 inquiries. These responses were either responded to directly by the Unit or redirected to the appropriate staff within IDOC. Inquiries were submitted through multiple channels, USPS, IDOC website, telecom services, public meetings, and direct contact with community stakeholders. The Unit focused on its goal to manage effective communication between concerned communities and IDOC. During FY22, the Constituent Services Unit facilitated two-way communication between the Department and the communities it serves by implementing a data driven approach to address constituent concerns. The Constituent Services Unit tracked the concerns of constituents from the initial communication received, follow up that was completed, and the resolution of the issue by Department or its staff. The Unit's development of improved data tracking to capture constituent communications and address constituent concerns, allowed the Unit to identify trends and patterns among constituents. This allowed the Unit a pinpoint and address those categories that were reoccurring by reaching out to facilities directly to see how those issues could best be resolved. The Constituent Services Unit also became the primary point of contact for all communication between stakeholders and the Department in FY22; serving as the front-line response team to inquiries and concerns voiced by family members, friends, Governor's Office, advocacy groups, and other criminal justice organizations. Additionally, the Unit incorporated the use of a dedicated family liaison to meet its goals and deliver on its mission. The Constituent Services family liaison served as both a member of the Constituent Services Unit and as a dedicated point of contact person for family members, friends, and visitors with loved ones in the custody of IDOC. With the full support of the Constituent Services Unit, the family liaison was able to adequately address or respond questions or concerns directed to the Department by concerned family and friends with loved ones in IDOC custody. The Constituent Services Unit also provided judicious communication and follow up to concerns voiced by any person (i.e., parents and siblings, extended family, loved ones, clergy, etc.), advocacy groups, or self-identified concerned citizens. During FY22, the Constituent Services Unit was bridged the communication gap between the Department and the community at large.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report9Office of Health Services The Office of Health Services (OHS) continued to collaborate with the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) to provide guidance and medical direction for the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, which included expansion of facility surveillance testing and offered vaccinations for all individuals in custody. OHS further collaborated with IDPH and awarded a 7.5 million Department of Justice grant for COVID mitigation. In FY22, through a longstanding partnership with University of Illinois, Chicago Division of Infectious Disease, OHS increased the number of individuals in custody being treated for Hepatitis C by over 50% from the previous fiscal year. OHS also partnered with University of Illinois Chicago Division of Endocrinology to expand consultative services for individuals in custody with gender dysphoria on hormone therapy. In December 2021, OHS hosted \"World AIDS Day\" events for our individual in custody population followed by the launch of an HIV Peer Educator program in January 2022. Building on its existing partnership with the Southern Illinois University (SIU) School of Medicine Office of Correctional Medicine, OHS collaborated with SIU to establish agency-wide Quality Improvement Outcome measures and implemented a comprehensive Mortality Review Process in January 2022. Also, in FY22, OHS partnered with physician specialists and consultants from the World Professional Association on Transgender Health to support the agency's transgender health program. To improve care to the agency's aging population, OHS re-established exploration of a Dementia Friendly prison concept with UIC College of Medicine. In recognition of the growing potential threat to correctional staff and individuals in custody to the exposure to high potency opioids, established a policy and made Narcan, a reversal agent for opioid overdose, available in all IDOC facilities. Administrative Review Board In FY22, the Administrative Review Board (ARB) received 17,002 grievances. All grievances that receive a review by the ARB are receipted. A copy of the receipt is sent to the individual in custody notifying him or her that their grievance has been received and will be reviewed. This procedure stems from a grievance receipt process that was implemented statewide on November 1, 2018. Seven chairpersons are responsible for reviewing all grievance submissions and receipting and responding to them. An Executive I within the unit reviews all facility revocations/restorations of time submissions. In FY22, the Administrative Review Board received 1,731 facility submissions for revocations and/or restorations. ARB reviews these submissions to ensure the ticket was written correctly, the hearing was conducted properly, discipline is in line with prior discipline and/or the offense, and if Seriously Mentally Ill, the proper mental health review was conducted. ARB conducts approximately 30 protective custody hearings a month for IDOC's maximum-security facilities. In addition, ARB reviews and makes determinations on any person in custody who is removed from IDOC's bootcamp program. Due to the number of subpoenas the Administrative Review Board receives from various legal entities, a full-time position was established to respond to the requests. In FY22, the Administrative Review Board received 577 legal requests with the Administrative Review Board supplying a total of 91,645 pages of records.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report10Operations Jail and Detention Standards The mission of the Jail and Detention Standards Unit is to monitor compliance with Illinois County Jail Standards, Illinois Municipal Jail and Lockup Standards, and the Federal Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Act. The purpose of monitoring is to develop standardized practices in detention facilities that enhance the health and safety of the detainees, detention staff, and the public. In addition, the office provides assistance and services to facilitate the development of those practices. State statute established the unit and directed that the office will inspect all 91 county jails on an annual basis. Municipal lockups are inspected upon request of the chief of police. In FY22, 17 municipal inspections were completed. Jail and Detention Standards has the authority to refer facilities in serious noncompliance to the Illinois Attorney General for remediation. This authority has recommended further review of specific substandard facilities. The unit also approves new facility construction of jails, and lockups throughout Illinois. Staff members monitor approximately 1,100 municipal police departments and 91 county jails for compliance with federal secure juvenile detention requirements. In FY22, there were 340 juvenile monitoring inspections completed by the unit. The Jail and Detention Standards Unit provides an adequate system of monitoring jails, lockups, and non-secure facilities to ensure that delinquent minors are being held in accordance with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention policies and procedures. The criminal justice specialists annually visit law enforcement facilities to determine which facilities detain youths and which do not. Those who do not detain youths are considered No Hold facilities and only need to be visited every three years rather than annually. Criminal justice specialists conduct on-site inspections of county jails and municipal lockups for compliance with standards. All 91 county jails were inspected in FY22. Staff members conduct follow-ups on unusual occurrences and provide consultations regarding detention operations, renovations, new construction, and staffing recommendations. In the capacity of consultants, unit staff responds to citizen and detainee complaints relating to detention operations, civil rights, and legal responsibilities. The unit responded to 138 detainee complaint letters and provided 411 technical assistance requests to jails in FY22. The unit collects monthly detainee population statistics from county jails and quarterly from municipal lockups. A database is maintained for this information, which is ultimately sent to the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority on an annual basis. Operations Center The Operations Center is a multifaceted area within IDOC. The center, which provides 24-hour assistance and availability, serves as the statewide command post serving the needs for both adult and juvenile offenders within IDOC and the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice. The Operations Center provides continuous Law Enforcement Agencies Data System/ National Crime Information Center (LEADS/NCIC) communication, access and maintenance of parole warrants and related information to field staff. In addition, it tracks all mass high-risk institution and parole transports of offenders, providing another layer of safety and efficiency. The center is also responsible for dissemination of local and federal criminal history data to appropriate IDOC agents, offices, and local law enforcement agencies. In addition, the Operations Center handles a large volume of phone calls daily and serves as an instrumental liaison for IDOC to law enforcement agencies and the public.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report11Operations Transfer Coordinator's Office The Transfer Coordinator's Office (TCO) is responsible for coordinating the movement and determining the appropriate placement of all adult individuals in custody within the Illinois Department of Corrections. Since the TCO was established over 30 years ago, the Department has expanded to the present level of 20 adult facilities, 2 mental health facilities, and 4 Life Skills Re-Entry facilities, 2 substance abuse facilities, 1 sex offender treatment facility, 4 reception and classification centers (R & C), adult transitional centers (ATC), and Structured Impact Programs (SIP). To efficiently coordinate individual in custody placement and movement, the TCO expanded to its present staffing level of Transfer Coordinator Manager (SPSA), two Assistant Managers (PSA), eight Assignment Coordinators, and six Clerical Staff. The TCO determines any initial or subsequent security and placement designations of individuals in custody prior to their movement. Individual in custody's General Office file is reviewed annually to determine appropriate placement, balancing between the protection and safety of the public, and the individual in custody's needs. An individual in custody's special needs that are considered in placement decisions include but are not limited to ADA issues, substance abuse treatment needs, Security Threat Group issues, Keep Separate From (KSF) issues, medical or mental health needs, protective custody or special management needs, those individuals in custody classified as Sexually Dangerous Person (SDP) or Sexually Violent Person (SVP), and those considered as extreme escape risks. There is an imperative need to keep the population flowing out of the Reception & Classification Centers in order to facilitate the continual delivery of individuals from the county jails. The TCO also screens and coordinates individual in custody placement within the SIPs and works with the Chief of Program's Office to help review placements for ATCs and Electronic Detention. Placement of individuals in custody in ATC programs is a resource utilized in population control. Placement of an approved individual in custody in an ATC is done after all proper notifications are sent to the Sheriffs and States Attorneys as mandated by the statute. The TCO serves as the liaison and coordinator of the Interstate Corrections Compact and is responsible for coordinating the transfer of individuals in custody on an international level in cooperation with the Department of Justice. Individuals in custody who are approved for a new placement are then prioritized for movement based on bed space, bus availability, and the urgency for transfer. Factors such as discipline, KSF or safety issues, warrants or detainers, programming, writ housing, changes in security, and medical or mental health conditions are considered when determining priorities. The movement of individuals in custody involves statewide coordination of the Central Transportation Unit (CTU) by the TCO using 24 buses at 14 facilities. To ensure bus availability, the TCO is in constant contact with the facilities to ensure that the buses, which are aging and very high in miles, are maintained and safe to drive long distances. The TCO also coordinates transportation for Cadet Training Classes. Cadets require transport from their parent facilities to and from the Training Academy on Mondays and Fridays. They also need transport for any special training exercises that take place during each class. Since the onset of COVID-19, all intake requests from county jails are meticulously tracked, the intakes scheduled, and the individuals in custody quarantined and tested by both the sending and the receiving facilities. All aspects of this process are communicated with the jails from all 102 counties as well as the 4 R & C's on a daily basis by TCO staff. Administrative Keep Separate From (KSF) add and removal requests are processed by the TCO, as are requests to remove KSFs between individuals in custody. A statewide bed report is compiled daily, including the beds required for a variety of units. Writ transfer requests are individually reviewed, and the transfer destinations are selected. Correspondence and calls from individuals in custody, their families, concerned citizens, attorneys, law enforcement, government officials and agencies, IDOC administrators, and legal staff are received and acknowledged daily. Other duties include compiling reports, completing special projects, and maintaining special population profiles. The responsibilities of the Transfer Coordinator's Office extend far beyond the scope of transferring individuals in custody throughout Illinois. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report12Ensuring the correct placement recommendation and transport for the individuals in custody state-wide has is a multi-faceted process. This process was made additionally complex in March 2020 due to the ever-changing COVID-19 guidelines. The TCO has remained dynamic, adapting to the fluctuating demands of the times. Since accepting county intakes was a mandatory function, moving individuals in custody out of the R & C's was also exigent despite new hurdles. In the middle of March 2020, all movement was suspended due to COVID-19. At this point, movement from the R & C's is reinstated, however, movement from Correctional Facilities continues to operate under limitations. All high-priority transfers between facilities that cannot be accommodated on bus movement are approved by their respective Deputy Director, TCO, and OHS. Writ transfers that were once transported via the Central Transportation Unit remain suspended, and facilities are required to drive them to court or use videoconference technology. During FY22, a total of 19,168 individuals in custody moved via the Central Transportation Unit, averaging 369 per week. In addition, the movement of correctional officer cadets to and from the Training Academy for Pre-Service Security Training is also handled through the CTU. In FY22, 9,629 correctional officer cadets were transported, averaging 185 cadets per week. During FY22, the TCO Assignment Coordinators approved placements for 12,430 individuals in custody from R & C facilities. The TCO processed 20,930 transfer requests and completed 4,494 offender security reclassifications. The TCO processed 1,521 ATC requests, and 308 Substance Abuse program transfer requests. Parole The Parole Division aims to promote public safety through supervision utilizing reentry resources, community partnerships, and graduated sanctions. This division is dedicated to reducing recidivism and emphasizes the needs of returning men and women to the community, focusing on housing options, mental health issues, op - tions for employment opportunities, and establishing networks to ensure adequate medical care is available to remain healthy. In addition to Violence Reduction Collaborations and Day Reporting Centers, the Parole Division has implemented Video Visitation and a Risk Assessment Tool to assist with the supervision of Parolees in the community. The Parole Division, in conjunction with the Chicago Police Department, members of the local community, the U.S. Attorney's Office, Cook County State's Attorney Office, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and numerous other agencies in key police districts throughout the Chicago area hold informational forums with gang affiliated parolees to combat violence in the community. IDOC utilizes Day Reporting Centers (DRC) as a resource and re-entry for persons under parole supervision, who are vulnerable to drugs, crime, gangs, violence, unemployment, poverty, and family dissolution. These centers include a highly structured program that offers an alternative sanction for non-violent parole violators. In direct response to COVID-19, IDOC Parole adopted the ability to conduct video face-to-face visits with our supervised population when home visits were not an option during stay-at-home orders. Parole Agents can still ensure our supervised individuals' needs are met. Video Visitation, also known as BI Smart Link, has proven to be a successful tool, and Parole will continue to use this method of supervision post-pandemic for low-level parolees. The Parole Division completed development and implementation of a Risk Assessment Tool for the men and women on parole. This Risk Assessment Tool ensures compliance with the 2009 Illinois Crime Reduction Act and will improve the supervision needs of those who are on parole. The individual's risk assessment score aids in determining what level of supervision is needed. Parole Agents are trained and complete risk assessments on all individuals who are currently on regular parole supervision. The Risk Assessment Tool led to increased numbers of individuals recommended for early discharge from parole and reduced the need of intense supervision while on Mandatory Supervised Release.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report13Programs and Support Services Office of Adult Education and Vocational Services The mission of the Office of Adult Education and Vocational Services (OAEVS) is to enhance the quality and scope of education for individuals in custody within the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) consistent with age, commitments, and sentence by ensuring that the state and federal resources are appropriately used in aiding committed persons to restore themselves to constructive and law-abiding lives in the community. OAEVS continues to provide quality educational opportunities to the population with the goal of increasing academic achievement. Education is vital to reducing recidivism and creating opportunities for individuals in custody to better themselves. OAEVS staff continues to work hard in assisting students in achieving their educational goals. Since 1987, all individuals committed to IDOC for two or more years, except those serving life sentences, take the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) to determine their academic level. Students are placed in academic and vocational programming based on TABE test score. Library services are available throughout IDOC. Libraries offer a variety of recreational reading materials such as books, magazines, and newspapers. Individuals in custody have a constitutional right to access the court system. Law libraries are maintained and contain Federal and State of Illinois Constitutions, statutes, and court decisions. Resource materials help patrons research the law and prepare legal documents exercising their constitutional right of access to state and federal courts. Adult Basic Education (ABE) is a critical component in the education programming of OAEVS. ABE is mandatory for all individuals in custody scoring below 6.0 on the TABE test. Mandatory ABE students must attend a minimum of 90 days of instruction. The ABE core curriculum provides instruction in basic reading, writing, mathematics, and life skills. The program is designed to provide students with a base of skills and knowledge that will prepare them for additional academic/vocational instruction and subsequent employment. High School Equivalency (HSE), formally known as GED, is available to all individuals in custody who score an 8.0 or higher on a TABE test. OAEVS implements computer-based instruction and testing of HSE at all facilities. Post-secondary educational programming continues to be vital in the rehabilitation of individuals in custody. College-level coursework was offered in many vocational areas such as Auto Body, Auto Mechanics, Barbering, Career Tech, Construction Occupations, Commercial Custodial, Cosmetology, Culinary Arts, Horticulture, Nail Tech, Restaurant Management, Warehousing, and Welding. These programs educate students in practical vocational applications allowing the hands-on training that can be carried on to the workforce upon release. College academic courses were offered that allowed students the opportunity to pursue an associate degree. Research indicates that the higher the level of education achievement, the lower the percentage of recidivism. OAEVS encourages all individuals in custody to participate in a degree earning program, with the goal of preparing them for employment upon release. The OAEVS continues to work with major colleges towards implementing 4-year degrees. FY22 was greatly impacted with COVID protocols. Attendance, achievement, and completion rates drastically decreased due to the lack of in-person classroom instruction. Staffing is an issue and is expected to increase due to high waitlist numbers. OAEVS has increased the PSA, library and office staff positions while trying to keep the educator positions filled due to retirements and resignations. Education is a positive motivator for students. The waitlist has increased, attributed to a new law that took effect in 2018 and again in 2022 that allows more students to earn program sentence credit. The education program is the top producer of \"good time\" within IDOC. Students continue to enroll in school and be eligible for Earn Program Sentence Credit (EPSC).

The Department strives to deliver services in a respectful, responsive and efficient manner with sensitivity to Diversity of Culture, Language, Ethnicity, Gender and Sexual Identity. In collaboration with additional Support Services and Operations within the Agency's Facilities, the office seeks to maximize the resources available and attend to concerns for the safety and well-being of individuals. Services and support are designed to provide meaningful assistance to the individual in acquiring and maintaining those mental, emotional, and social skills, which enable the offender to function most effectively with the demands of his or her own person or environment. IDOC's identified Mental Health caseload is approximately 43 percent of its current population of approximately 30,000 men/women in custody. IDOC has experienced an increase in its overall population, approximately 2,000 offenders compared to this time last year. This increase in the overall population continues to lead to a percentage increase in the mental health caseload. The Office of Mental Health Management (OMHM) has improved the mental health services delivery system using our Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) program aimed at systematic, ongoing, objective monitoring, evaluation, and improvement of the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of mental health offender care. This program has allowed the department to monitor itself accurately and effectively through both internal and external processes. Additionally, OMHM has developed and implemented several new procedures such as weekly case consultations, the creation of a modified Residential Treatment Unit level of care, and improvements to several procedural processes. All procedures are aimed at strengthening the quality-of-service delivery to the individuals in custody. OMHM has expanded professional development opportunities for mental health and psychiatric staff by sponsoring continuing educational trainings and focusing on improving the knowledge of our staff around transgender education and risk assessment. OMHM partnered with Southern Illinois University (SIU), Northwestern University (NU), California State University, and several others to present several educational lectures to our staff and the department.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report15Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) was passed in 2003 with unanimous support from both parties in Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2003. The purpose of the Act was to \"provide for the analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape in Federal, State, and local institutions and to provide information, resources, recommendations and funding to protect individuals from prison rape\". The Illinois Department of Corrections maintains a strict \"Zero Tolerance\" policy towards all forms of sexual abuse and sexual harassment; and provides guidelines for the prevention, detection, response, investigation, and tracking of all allegations. All allegations of sexual abuse and sexual harassment are taken seriously, investigated, and when applicable, referred for prosecution and/or discipline. While incarcerated within IDOC, the safety of the individuals in our custody is a primary concern; and that safety includes the right to be free from sexual abuse, harassment, and retaliation. During FY22, the Department concentrated its efforts on access to advocacy and support services for our incarcerated men and women. Through a partnership with the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA), the Department and ICASA were able to collaborate to create a template memorandum of understanding (MOU) to ensure our men and women in custody have timely access to confidential support services and victim advocacy provided by local rape crisis centers in the community. With tremendous help and guidance from ICASA, the Department has now entered into 29 exclusive MOUs between local crisis centers and our correctional facilities. The Department is consistently pursuing methods to prevent, deter, and investigate sexual abuse and sexual harassment. Upgrades to technology, including expanding video monitoring capabilities, is one of the best approaches. Utilizing grant funds from the Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), the Department was able to purchase video monitoring equipment and install it in our PRISM housing unit cluster at the Centralia Correctional Center. PRISM is a program for individuals who have been identified as a vulnerable or otherwise bullied population. The addition of the video monitoring equipment is another tool to ensure the safety of this population. To ensure compliance with the PREA Standards, the Department utilizes independent outside contractors certified by the U.S. Department of Justice to validate the Department's compliance with PREA. Each year, the Department undergoes PREA audits on 1/3 of its facilities and adult transition centers. During FY22, the Department began the third and final year of the three-year audit cycle of facility PREA audits. During this cycle year, ten facilities and one adult transition center were audited. Nine of the facilities were found to be in full compliance with the PREA Standards and two facilities are currently in a corrective action period.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report16Re-Entry Illinois Department of Corrections' Re-Entry Unit grew and expanded in many areas throughout FY22. As the Re- Entry Unit was established January 1, 2020, many initiatives that initially began in FY21 were grown, expanded, and fully implemented this fiscal year. In FY22, the Parole Re-Entry Group (PRG) received 5,142 referrals for transitional housing or re-entry placements. PRG placed 2,898 individuals in contracted and non-contracted transitional housing placements in the community, nursing homes, or higher level of care settings for individuals with severe mental illness. PRG expanded services for individuals releasing from custody with severe mental illness (SMI). Three new contracts in Parole District 1 were executed with High Need SMI transitional housing vendors in July 2021, to include Trilogy, Bobby E. Wright and Thresholds. These vendors were contracted to provide transitional housing and mental health services to individuals on parole in need of structured and increased mental health services. In October 2021, PRG executed contracts with two new high service level transitional housing placements: Decatur Transitional Housing Complex (male placement) and The House of Mary in East St. Louis (female placement). Both placements are contracted to house individuals on parole up to 120 days and provide residents three meals per day, transportation to appointments as needed, basic case management services, employment readiness and job linkage services, cognitive behavioral or parenting groups, computer/internet access, assistance with obtaining vital documents and identification, and assistance in locating stable, long term housing options. The SNAP pilot that IDOC Re-Entry is running in collaboration with DHS expanded to six additional facilities, bringing the total number of facilities running this pilot to nine in FY22. This program assists to address food insecurity for individuals releasing from custody. The final onboarding training for the State ID Program was completed in collaboration with the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, and all IDOC facilities were officially running this program in March 2022. In FY22, the Secretary of State issued 771 State IDs to individuals pre-release. In FY22, visits to facility Re-Entry Resource Rooms drastically increased. In April 2022, IDOC Re-Entry celebrated Second Chance Month with the implementation of several initiatives including the In-Reach Webinar series. WebEx TVs in all facility Re-Entry Resource Rooms were utilized to bring individuals in custody re- entry related presentations, employment workshops, and virtual job fairs facilitated by community resources, organizations, and other state agencies. These provided information on community re-entry resources, individuals' rights upon release, employment training opportunities, and workforce related resources.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report17Religious Services The Chaplaincy and Religious Programming department, in coordination with all appropriate levels of leadership and the appropriate CMS staff, successfully updated the language utilized within the hiring process for Facility Chaplains. Specifically updating the education, ecclesiastical, field specific, and professional requirements of all new IDOC Facility Chaplains to ensure the standards of IDOC, at minimum, met the most commonly accepted standards for industry, governmental, and private sector professional chaplains. Therein, ensuring IDOC either meets or exceeds the minimum requirements for all future Facility Chaplains. The Chaplaincy and Religious Programming department initiated the process of developing department level standard operating procedures, which all Facility Chaplains can utilize to streamline the implementation of religious programming and ensure a continuity of care and programming across the state. The Chaplaincy and Religious Programming department finalized a multi-year undertaking of re-developing what is commonly known as the \"Chaplain's Handbook.\" To meet not only accreditation requirements and standards, but also advance the Department to the standards of near-peer organizations, the overhaul and authoring of this handbook was completed in partnership with multiple-facility level chaplains, academic partners, and sister- organization staff. These changes ensure all Facility Chaplains have a ready, reliable, and relevant codified source, which aligns will all applicable National, State, and Department rules and regulations, for the authorization, development, and implementation of programming, inquiry, and professional development. This advancement in administrative and regulatory uniformity more acutely supports the broader mission of IDOC, and the specific mission of the Chaplaincy and Religious Programming department, in providing holistic religious services to all individuals in custody regardless of faith tradition or denomination to ensure IDOC provides the highest caliber possible of religious support and spiritual care to all we are entrusted to provide care for. Staff Development and Training The Illinois Department of Corrections Office of Staff Development and Training mission focuses on the development of quality training in all correctional subjects identified as essential for accomplishing the agency mission. Instruction administered by the Office of Staff Development and Training will be pertinent, realistic, up to date, and will be accessible to all employees of the Department of Corrections and other partnering agencies. Professionalism, accountability, and the highest ethical standards are presented within each curriculum offered throughout our training sites. FY22 provided another eventful and challenging year for the Office of Staff Development and Training with the hiring of seven cadet classes, which resulted in graduating just over 700 new staff from the Pre-Service Correctional Training program. The cadet number in each class was reduced significantly due to COVID-19 mitigations of social distancing. Another obstacle for training was the nationwide shortage of ammunition. With this shortage, the Office of Staff Development and Training was able to adapt and continue running Pre-Service Correctional Trainings with the assistance from all facilities and having new hires complete the entire Academy program, except for weapons certification. A few more highlights from FY22 include the development of training curricula to be introduced at facility or regional training sites, to increase the number of staff trained. One of those classes included Instructional Methods, which has been a backlogged training for many years. This introduction led to the certification of over 200 more staff to train for the department, which cleared the backlog. With the introduction of facility in-service training, staff resource computers were beginning to be implemented for all staff to use for Online Trainings. The Training Academy worked diligently to update and train staff through the COVID-19 pandemic. As we implemented facility-based training for in-service classes, we developed practical scenario-based training for new hires and existing staff. This new curriculum will be introduced with the opening of the new state of the art Training Academy in September 2022.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report18Staff Wellness The Staff Wellness Response Team grew in numbers and developed new training during FY22. 60 additional members were scheduled for their Critical Incident Stress Management training. Once this training is complete, a panel, including Staff Wellness Regional Coordinators, will conduct interviews for an additional 30 members. In FY22, 1,108 staff members participated in the 'Correctional Fatigue to Fulfillment' workshop. In FY22, the SWRT developed and began hosting 'All Things You' at facilities. 'All Things You' is a wellness day at facilities featuring a training focused on the eight dimensions of wellness for all staff members. 14 SWRT members were selected and trained as instructors for 'All Things You'. Three facilities were selected to receive an 'All Things You' training in the fall. In FY22, the SWRT began plans to create staff wellness rooms in each facility, which is a private area for staff to use to decompress after a critical incident. Plans for the rooms include the availability of materials and resources that are beneficial to mental and emotional health for staff. The SWRT leadership participates in a monthly meeting with a consortium comprised of Staff Wellness leadership from across the country. The SWRT is working with the CMS coordinator to launch wellness challenges and competitions for staff members. Facility Highlights Big Muddy River Correctional Center During FY22, Big Muddy River Correctional Center continued to weather the storm of COVID-19 and adjust and adapt to the changing work environment and practices. The facility returned to full Medical Quarantine status on 12/29/21 due to an uptick in COVID-19 cases and was subsequently approved by OHS to phase to Administrative Quarantine status effective 3/8/22, at which time a return to normalcy plan was implemented, allowing for resumption of reduced capacity in-person services, programming, and activities. Strong leadership, teamwork, and adhering to the health and safety protocol and policies as set forth by OHS, CDC, and IDOC allowed Big Muddy River CC to successfully navigate FY22 while remaining focused on maintaining our responsibility to ensure the safety and welfare of the citizens of Illinois and the individuals in custody in our care. Big Muddy River CC continued to serve as the Southern Region RDC 5 distribution and pickup site throughout FY22's COVID-19 response.

Vocational programming opportunities at Big Muddy River CC include Auto Mechanics, Construction, Horticulture, Culinary Arts, and Career Technology. Due to the structured class settings, vocational opportunities for individuals in custody during FY22 were limited due to restrictions imposed by COVID-19, coupled with vacancies of the Automotive Mechanics and Culinary Arts instructors. As a result, vocational classes were suspended from 12/28/21 through 3/1/22, Automotive classes did not resume until April 2022, and Culinary Arts classes were suspended from February 2022 through the end of FY22. In FY22, 78 students participated in vocational services. Career Technology had 48 participants and 28 completers.

The now titled Du Quoin Impact Program, is temporarily operating out of an area within the Murphysboro Life Skills Re-Entry Center, due to staffing levels. Cooperation of both facility's staff has been vital to the continued partnership and even the integration of each population into cooperative programming. At different times since March of 2020, MLSRC has operated under a modified administrative quarantine protocol. The dorm and bunk style living quarters makes it unique to most other facilities throughout the state. Strict cleaning regimens were implemented in all areas with daily cleaning logs completed.

North Lawndale Adult Transition Center North Lawndale Adult Transition Center (NLATC) is a 200-bed facility operated by the Safer Foundation for adult male persons in the custody of the IDOC. It is located on the westside of Chicago, within walking distance of its sister facility, Crossroads ATC. A prerequisite of being transferred to an ATC requires a parole date that does not exceed 24 months, or 30 months for residents who are assigned to Permanent Party duties at the facility. In a post-COVID environment, the facility has not yet reached its full capacity. Our population has risen to 120 residents, with half of one wing reserved for residents who may require being placed on quarantine status due to COVID-related concerns. Recently, ATCs began receiving residents who were listed as SAFE-T ACT. This population has short-term sentences, limited to four months or less. Despite this limitation of time, NLATC provides all the services which are afforded to residents with longer sentences, including assignment of a Case Manager, application for a Social Security card and State ID, scheduling of medical services at UIC Miles Square Health Clinic, and a post- release plan of transition. The changes to the Good Time procedures of IDOC, enacted in July 2021, had a significant impact on the turnover of ATC residents. The introduction of a Day-For-A-Day Good Time drastically changed the length of stay for many residents. Most residents with Earned Program Sentencing Credit Contracts, are now eligible for Day-For-A-Day reduction in sentence, if they are in good standing in their program and have no disciplinary offenses. Residents Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report47may also earn additional days if they participate in Basic Skills (HSE/ABE/GED) and reduce their MSR date by three months if they obtain their GED. Some residents also receive days when reviewed for Earned Discretionary Sentencing Credit by the parent institution for making an excellent adjustment while in IDOC and NLATC. Basic Skills classes resumed on July 13, 2021, servicing 156 students for FY22. As a result, four students obtained their High School Equivalency credentials. In August, Basic Skills piloted a Transportation, Distribution & Logistics (TDL) program for students identified as having a High School Diploma or High School Equivalency. Students attended class two days a week combined with asynchronous learning. The TDL program serviced sixty-two residents with an 80% completion rate. 20% of the completers were interested in pursuing post- secondary education. With the general resumption of all work opportunities at NLATC, over 85% residents are fully employed in the community, with an average of 175+ program hours per resident per month, and with 80% positive exits. Safer's Basic Skills Education Program helped residents obtain four GEDs. NLATC residents typically leave the program with a minimum of $3,000 in their Trust Fund Accounts and many have as much as $15,000-$20,000 when they leave. It is a testament to the operations of NLATC that there have been no positive cases of COVID during 2022 and very few in 2021. This was the result of a consistent and coordinated response, which included the mandatory use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for all staff, residents, and visitors, including always wearing masks except during meals, on-going COVID testing for all unvaccinated staff and residents, and protocols to perform deep cleaning throughout the facility on an on-going basis. Safer Foundation has developed links to the UIC Miles Square Health Network, which resulted in the installation of a nursing station within the facility. Although the assigned UIC nurse is part-time, the direct access of Miles Square personnel (including access to telehealth possibilities) resulted in a quantum leap in healthcare services, with most residents being seen within seven days upon their arrival at NLATC. The facility also participates in PROJECT HEAL, an initiative which makes MAT (Medically Assisted Treatment) available to all NLATC residents who voluntarily wish to participate. While not applicable to all drug dependencies, studies have shown that evidence-based therapy can dramatically assist residents who have a history of opioid and/or alcohol problems. While some of our volunteer activities are still only available remotely (on Zoom - including Reading Between the Lines and Kolbe House), a few have returned to provide in-person services to our residents. Some of our chaplains, recovering alcoholics from AA, and students in the UIC nursing program are among the volunteers who have returned to the facility. In addition, the full spectrum of training and employment opportunities through the Safer Foundation (i.e., including initiatives with the Chicago Transit Authority, CDL and CNC courses, and hands-on training for plumbing, electrician, and carpentry apprentices) have rebounded as well. The level of professionalism and dedication displayed by NLATC staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath continues to be nothing less than amazing. Every day, staff have \"suited up and shown up\" willing to put their lives quite literally on the line to provide essential services for our resident population. NLATC Success Story - In 1999, Marvin Marshall was incarcerated for murder. He was just 17 years old. He spent the next 20 years in various IDOC facilities, until finally being transferred to NLATC on November 6, 2020, as a Permanent Party Maintenance Worker - after changes in the criteria for ATC transfers. After completing his contract as Permanent Party, he obtained employment and worked consistently, without any issues, until his parole date of April 5, 2022. He never had a single disciplinary issue while at NLATC. He rose to our highest level of privileges and was able to transition into the community without any issues. Resident Marshall is a prime example of the kind of positive change that can occur prior to release when exposed to the environment of an ATC. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report48Peoria Adult Transition Center Peoria Adult Transition Center (ATC) is housed in one building in downtown Peoria. At approximately 48,000 square feet, it contains 248 beds in dorm-type rooms with six to 12 residents per room.

Peoria ATC Clinical Services provides access to mandated drug or alcohol counseling. The Corrections Assessment Specialists, along with Counseling staff, provide or facilitate in-house, peer-based programs for residents to participate at any level. The counseling and assessment staff also facilitate services for community-based support and recovery groups which include AA/NA, Anger Management, life skills, marriage counseling, parenting, and HIV/AIDS awareness. The Peoria ATC's Business Office is responsible for maintaining accurate trust fund accounts, payment for Permanent Party Resident work assignments, and the individual in custody benefit fund. In FY22, Peoria ATC developed and implemented a new initiative. As part of the facility's financial literacy initiative, residents were permitted to open one outside bank account and obtain a debit card. This allowed residents to reduce the amount of cash carried and helped them develop a working relationship with a financial institution. Peoria ATC's goal is to provide residents with the tools they need to be financially literate when they parole from the facility. Transition centers are a necessary component to reduce recidivism. ATC's gradually transition individuals in custody back into society. With the Department approving an exception to criteria for placements at Adult Transition Centers, more classifications now qualify for placement and are afforded an opportunity to step down from maximum to transitional security level placement. Peoria ATC's goal to provide residents with the tools needed reintegrate successfully back into society. When they parole from the facility, it is our hope that we have provided our communities with a person with a job, sufficient funds to sustain themselves, a place to live, and who is reconnected their families.

security level is different, population may have housed juveniles or a different gender, primary role of the facility regarding program services has been altered, etc.) 2Expenditures among satellite facilities cannot be extracted from parent facilities as administrative, dietary, medical, staffing, service costs, etc. are shared. Also, the expenditures here only include correctional facilities; some expenditures such as parole, general office, and shared services, etc. are not included. The FY21 GRF total expenditures for the Department of Corrections were $1,278,110,010. 3Elgin Treatment Center's Average Daily FY22 Population is caluclated using 350 days rather than 365 days, as it closed on 6/15/2022. Joliet Inpatient Treatment Center's Average Daily FY22 Population is caluclated using 15 days rather than 365 days, as it did not open until 6/16/2022. 4Per capita costs are calculated as expenditures divided by average daily population (ADP). For the same reasons listed in footnote #1, the historical intra- and inter-institution comparisons are affected. Further, per capita costs are a function of economies of scale which further limits an objective comparison between correctional sites; especially higher security level sites or sites with a small number of individuals. 5Elgin Treatment Center was a mental health inpatient treatment facility that opened on April 2, 2018 and was replaced by Joliet Inpatient Treatment Center (JITC) on 6/16/2022; JITC's parent facility is Joliet Treatment Center. 6Joliet Treatment Center is a multi-disciplinary treatment facility that opened on October 6, 2017. 7Murphysboro Life Skills Re-Entry Center opened on April 16, 2018; it's parent facility is Pinckneyville Correctional Center.Facility Characteristics on June 30, 2022Illinois Department of Corrections | FY22 Annual Report70Statistics for FY22 Average Daily Prison Population Prison Offense Violation3467 Technical Violation44,159 Admissions 18,371 FY22 Prison Exits Mandatory Supervised Release 14,279 Parole 9 Discharges 2,377 Death 92 Court Ordered Release 11 Total Exits 16,768 FY22 Sentence Credits Type of Credit Exits5Total Days AwardedAverage Days Awarded Per Exit Supplemental Sentence Credit (SSC)62 284 142.0 Earned Discretionary Abuse 1,705 314,165 184.3 Behavior Modification 960 17,368 18.1 65,833 38.6 Re-Entry Planning 691 65,422 94.7 Correctional Industries 309 74,575 241.3 1 Admission to IDOC during each fiscal year (July 1 - June 30). 2 Court admission is defined as an adult admitted from criminal court who is not on MSR or parole. 3 A new offense violation is defined as an adult readmitted from criminal court for a felony committed while on MSR or parole. 4 A technical violation is defined as an adult on MSR or parole readmitted because of an MSR or parole rule violation. 5 Exits do not include Technical Violators. 6 Supplemental Sentence Credit (SSC) was redefined as Earned Discretionary Sentence Credit (EDSC) starting 1/1/2019.
