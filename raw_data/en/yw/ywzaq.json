The proposal is based on three departments from twoinstitutions, two in France and one in Spain which share the same population-basedapproach for the investigation of respiratory health problems. Interest in environment, biologyand genetics is developed through analytical epidemiological research. Committed to publichealth issues and clinical relevance, they are further concerned by the need of decreasingEuropean fragmentation in research structures. Timeliness of the project relates to thecurrent dynamism of the three groups (creation in 2006 of laboratories both in France(Inserm U780, Villejuif) and in Spain (Creal, Barcelona), recruitment in 2006 of researchersboth in France (Inserm U578, Grenoble) and in Spain. The association will provide asustainable structure for the teams already involved in the Global Allergy and AsthmaNetwork of Excellence (Ga2len) and numerous national and international networks, willincrease European competitiveness and the visibility of respiratory epidemiology.Types of scientific collaboration will depend on current expertise and background,common interest, potential of added value for one or both institutions and scientific priority.Three lines of research with several topics are seen as final targets for collaborations :chronic obstructive respiratory diseases in adults (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonarydiseases), environmental determinants of respiratory health (occupational risks, air pollution,physical activity, diet, contact with animals and indoor exposure), as well as genetic andbiological approaches (by a variety of approaches, including biological collection sampling bynon invasive methods). In the emerging post genome respiratory epidemiology phase, twopriority areas for collaboration have been defined : epidemiological approaches to refinephenotyping in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and the joint study ofenvironmental and genetic factors (gene environment interactions).A coordination team integrated by one person from each institution (F Kauffmann andJM Ant\u00f3) is the basis of the organisational structure. For each research topic, a binationalteam will be in charge. Activities will include regular short visits (senior), several monthsexchange at the pre doc, post doc and junior level, biannual common internal seminars,common scientific papers favouring career development of junior researchers, organisationof open workshops, development of new projects in priority areas.Perspectives, depending on substantial support from both institutions on suchintegrated project may include the establishment of a common laboratory based on binationalconventions to further increase European competitiveness in this field of research of majorand still increasing public health importance.Inserm - Creal4/546/06/06Main publications in the last five years of members of each of the respiratory epidemiologyteamsInserm U780 (Epid\u00e9miologie et Biostatistique), V, Pin I, Kauffmann F, Kennedy S on behalf of the Epidemiological Study on thegenetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA).

Josep M Ant\u00f3 Inserm - Creal9/546/06/06 OBJECTIVES AND CONTEXTRationale and antecedentsObstructive lung diseases, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)represent major and increasing public health problems. The incidence of asthma has more thandoubled in the last three decades, concerning at least 5% of adults and 10% of children of the generalpopulation. COPD is anticipated to become the third cause of mortality worldwide by 2020, and anincreasing source of disability1. Despite the role of risk factors established so far, such as the majorrole of smoking in COPD, there is insufficient knowledge to prevent the occurrence of obstructivediseases or exacerbations among diseased patients. Classical hypotheses, such as the direct role ofinhaled allergens in asthma have been questioned. New hypotheses have been formulated such asthe potential protective role of contacts with infectious agents in early life, the deleterious effects ofcleaning agents in adult life for asthma2 as well as the systemic nature of COPD.The increase in asthma incidence in children has led worldwide to the development ofresearch in the paediatric age range, sometimes by distracting from adult respiratory epidemiologyresearch, at a time in which COPD is also increasing and cohorts with high asthma incidence inchildhood have reached adult age. New complexities are now apparent and, contrary to the commonbelief that risk factors are well established, new challenges have emerged. Life course epidemiology,considering windows of exposure for risk factors, and windows of disease expression over the lifespan, subtle gene environment interactions and interactions between environmental factors (such asthose along the oxidant/antioxidant pathway or controlling the pattern of immune response) becomemajor research approaches3. Evidence is accumulating that obstructive lung diseases areheterogeneous, both at the phenotypic and at the etiologic levels, which required to be delineated toset up efficient prevention and therapy. Such approaches need high expertise in the assessment ofenvironmental exposures, in phenotypic characterisation, and in analytic strategies. Access tosamples of large sizes and of various ages, collaboration with genetic and biological groups areneeded to develop post genome respiratory epidemiology4. The epidemiologic approach is central todisentangle the determinants of disease in the real setting, to understand its etiology and to assessthe impact of evolving risk factors on its evolution.Whereas numerous groups of cardiovascular, perinatal or cancer epidemiology existthroughout Europe, there is still a limited number of groups, generally of small size, conductingepidemiological research with quantitative approaches and an etiological orientation in the respiratoryepidemiology domain. Research teams at Inserm and Creal share the same strategic perspectiveregarding respiratory epidemiology. They are committed to European integration and have beenactive players in the field, through their participation to the Ga2len network of excellence (Globalallergy and asthma European network), international studies (ECRHS, European CommunityRespiratory Health Survey) or workshop organisation (post genome respiratory epidemiology). Theyhave a strong and internationally recognised expertise in analytical epidemiology. Combiningmethodological expertise in environmental issues on aspects of public health and clinical importance,they are also in the front line of the development of biological and genetical approaches in respiratoryepidemiology. The teams are highly experienced in study design, statistical analysis, methoddevelopment regarding the assessment of the environment, phenotypic characterization includingrecent non invasive in situ methods for studying pulmonary inflammation and have strongcollaborations with genetic groups. All teams have large experience in networking at the nationaland international levels. 1 Murray CJL, Lopez AD. Mortality by cause for eight regions of the world : Global burden of disease study.

Projects combining forexample two major studies on asthma (ECRHS5 and EGEA6 (Epidemiological study on the geneticsand Environment of Asthma) may be a driving force to build new structures. These two studies play acentral role for the three groups and both are part of the new European Integrated Project GABRIEL(A multidisciplinary study to identify the genetic and Environmental causes of asthma in the EuropeanCommunity) coordinated by B Cookson (UK), which started in February 2006. As illustrated in figure 1,these studies, by their common aims, similar main methods, different design and specificitiesconstitute a platform to mutually reinforce the approaches, for example by increasing the range inasthma severity or through potential mutual replication in adult asthma genetics.Fig 1.

Previous common activities are reported in appendix 1. Bothinstitutions are currently in a positive dynamic phase and the research teams want to take advantageof it to go further. Two of the laboratories, one in Villejuif (U780) and Creal in Spain have been createdin 2006. That same year, specialised researchers (junior and senior) have been recruited both in theyoung respiratory epidemiology team in Grenoble (U578) and in Creal.Proposal - aimsThe overall aim is to make significant progress in the field of respiratory epidemiology. As itneeds larger research groups and more integrated scientific activities, the purpose is to develop anassociation between groups of excellence in the field of respiratory epidemiology in the context of theconstruction of European laboratories. This proposal consists in developing a stable programme ofcollaboration between the respiratory groups of CREAL-IMIM, Unit 780 and 578 INSERM. Thecollaboration is applied under the figure of Associated Laboratories as a type of Mixed Laboratories.The specific aims of the International laboratory in respiratory epidemiology are two fold:To establish a stable collaboration in respiratory epidemiology in order to achieve a bettercritical size, in order to efficiently develop the field and attract new researchers in this exciting area.To improve efficiency and competitiveness of research efforts in terms of specialization 5 Sunyer J, Basaga\u00f1a X, Burney P, Ant\u00f3 JM, on behalf of the European Community Respiratory Health Study (ECRHS)(...,Soriano JB, Kogevinas M,...).

Such global approach should involve the definition of some common research priorities onwhich the complementary of the different groups and the other advantadges of developing a largerstructure (i.e. critical mass) can be exploited in contribution to the development of respiratoryepidemiology in Europe.2) To develop a sustainable structure in respiratory epidemiology that can facilitate thedevelopment of long-term longitudinal projects by providing an integrated multidisciplinary framework.Establishing durable structures is one major aim of work that already took place in the context of theEuropean network of excellence Ga2len (Global allergy and asthma European network). Both IMIMand Inserm are partners of the Ga2len network. One of the Inserm groups is leading the geneticworking package and Creal-IMIM leads the occupation work package in that network. This wellillustrates the complementary orientations of both institutions to develop modern respiratoryepidemiology taking into account environmental and genetic aspects.3) To take advantage of mutual strengths. Whereas all groups are highly experienced inrespiratory epidemiology, establishment of longitudinal cohorts and analytic strategy, they havespecific complementarities such as high experience in environmental exposures assessment inBarcelona as well, but in a lesser extent in Villejuif, high integration with genetic and biologicalapproaches in Villejuif as well but to a lesser extent in Barcelona, high clinical expertise in Grenobleand in a lesser extent in Barcelona, high experience in public health approaches in Barcelona.Whereas most European groups are now running asthma epidemiology programs, there is, contrary to20 years ago, less expertise in COPD epidemiology and the association of the group in Barcelona andVillejuif will strengthen projects underway in Barcelona and facilitate new developments in thatimportant area.4) To increase the visibility of the associated laboratories. Respiratory epidemiology isfacing new challenges, which requires a major development at the international level. Whereas theBarcelona and Villejuif groups have already been attractive laboratories in the field as shown by thenumber and quality of visiting senior researchers during sabbatical leave, the needs are much higher.It is essential that respiratory epidemiology becomes an attractive area of research for youngepidemiological scientists in Europe and elsewhere. The proposed International laboratory inrespiratory epidemiology would be a strong incentive in that area. It is worthy to note that theBarcelona group already organises each year in Florence a specialised summer course onenvironmental epidemiology with strong focus on respiratory health problems.In the following sections the scientific programme is presented according to a conceptualframework that has emerged from the previous collaboration background. The common researchprogramme is organized in several lines which are illustrated by various topics conducted by specificresearchers on which a degree of collaboration has been already developed or can be easilyanticipated. Finally the long-term priorities are defined as a way to secure that the collaboration willhave a substantial scientific added value. The organization and working plan is presented to set upvarious activities starting by short-term ones with a time-plan to structure activities around the definedpriorities. In appendices, are presented common activities (till 2005 and in the last 12 months), and adescription of the teams including their publications and grants.Inserm - Creal12/546/06/06 SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMEFrameworkThe framework of the scientific programme is based on the already existing capacities andprojects in both institutions. After a detailed analysis of existing activities three different types ofscientific collaboration have been distinguished:i) Research areas where both institutions have accumulated substantial expertise andbackground and are of common interest for the future (adult asthma, respiratory allergy andoccupational related risks),ii) Areas of research where there is complementarity for a variety of reasons that can result inadded value to one or both institutions (COPD, physical activity, air pollution and diet)iii) Research areas that are seen as of great potential and interest by both institutions, thoughcurrent development is still limited either because the state of the art is limited or because insufficientbackground (gene environment interactions, new biological markers).Lines of researchThe scientific programme of the present proposal is organized in three different lines ofresearch. These three lines include most of current and planned activities in both institutions. Withineach of these lines there are several topics that are seen as the final targets for collaboration.1) Chronic obstructive respiratory diseases in adults: asthma and COPDRegarding asthma (main persons involved: JMA, JS, CV, FK, VS, IP, ..), efforts have beenmade to standardize the phenotype in epidemiology and the ECRHS survey has set up a standardizedquestionnaire now used internationally. Assessing the probability of definite asthma, quantifying itsseverity and assessing its evolution over time poses new challenges. Methodological work regardingthe evolution of asthma, a disease with variable expression is pursued in Barcelona (ECRHS) andextensive work to define various dimensions regarding asthma severity has been conducted in Inserm(EGEA). A continuous score for asthma has been constructed in the ECRHS by the Barcelona group,which could relate to the probability of definite asthma and/or measure asthma severity. It is plannedto take into account new measures of asthma related phenotypes including quality of life on one sideand new biomarkers (derived from non invasive measures) in order to define robust measures ofasthma in general and subphenotypes (allergic and non allergic, mild and severe, persistent andvariable, etc). Whether definitions of asthma set up in a clinical setting (EGEA) or for generalpopulations (ECRHS) may be used in the other situation will be assessed. Specific work will beconducted to estimate the incidence, persistence and remission between childhood and adulthood inthe EGEA study. Projects may include a third follow-up in the ECRHS survey allowing to study theevolution of asthma in the general population and the occurrence of COPD.COPD (JMA, JG, FK, RN, RV ..) which has been classically defined through low lung function,has been a long term interest in the group in Villejuif. Recent litterature has shown the systemic natureof the disease and the need to incorporate new items in the phenotypic characterization. Low bodymass index, exercise capacity and muscle strength are now being used for staging the severity ofCOPD. Improving phenotypic definition of COPD will be approached by studying nutritional factors inInserm (Paris area work study, 2 examinations 1960 and 1972, survival data till 2006) and of physicalactivity in Creal (EFRAM study on COPD patients, Collaboration with Copenhagen city study to assessCOPD in a general population). It is planned to assess in Creal the phenotypic heterogeneity of COPDin a new study conducted in COPD patients with numerous physiological and biological markers8.Further it is planned to evaluate in the French EGEA study mixed forms between severe asthma and 8 PAC-COPD - Phenotype characterization and course of COPD. Cross-sectional and follow-up study of a cohort of patientswith COPD - conducted in Spain. Objective : Study phenotype heterogenetity of COPD and assess the relationship of varioussubphenotypes with disease course. Specific interest in physical activity. Population : 350 COPD patients from 10 centres of 3Spanish regions. Start : 2004, yearly examination planned over 5 years.Inserm - Creal13/546/06/06COPD by considering smoking asthmatics with low lung function and to explore the feasibility ofsetting up a research program on COPD in the large E3N survey9 as the age range is of particularinterest.2) ) represent a main cause of asthma andCOPD. Occupational asthma is now the first occupational respiratory disease. It is difficult to assessoccupational exposures in general populations. Major work has been conducted in Creal and inInserm regarding methods to assess asthma-specific occupational hazards : designing questionnaireson specific hazards for a number of jobs (such as cleaners, personel in hospitals etc..), and setting upa job exposure matrix (JEM) to assess exposure to a variety of asthmogens, both methods now usedinternationally at a large scale. The deleterious effect of cleaning has been evidenced. It is planned todevelop research on the methodological aspects such as examining the correlation between theassessments of specific exposures by the various methods (JEM, specific questionnaire), and updatethe asthma-specific JEM. A new study on cleaners is currently set-up in Spain. Joint analyses ofEGEA, ECRHS, and Sapaldia (major Swiss study) will be conducted using the various methods and inparticular on the effects of cleaning and disinfectant exposures.Air pollution (NK, JS, ER, FK, IR, ..) plays a role in various respiratory diseases. It increasesoverall mortality, is related to COPD and triggers asthma attacks. Its role in the occurrence of asthmais a debated issue. Estimation is extremely difficult, especially for assessing long-term effects.Members of Creal have performed methodological work regarding the estimation and analysis of airpollution effects and have shown its role both on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. It isplanned to evaluate the applicability of exposure assignment by geographical information system inEGEA and ECRHS and to investigate the risk of source specific pollution, in particular traffic related airpollution, on the incidence and course of asthma and COPD.Physical activity (JG, JMA, FK,..) is a new topic of interest in the respiratory epidemiologylitterature, which is of great interest from a public health point of view. In Creal, interestingobservations regarding the deleterious role of low physical activity in COPD exacerbations have beenshown. Contrary to epidemiological surveys in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, very fewstudies in the respiratory field have included measurements in physical activities. Such data areavailable in the EGEA2 survey as well as in the E3N survey . It is planned to develop epidemiologicalwork on physical activity as a full topic to explore its role in a variety of respiratory outcomes. Studieson the effects of physical activity on the incidence and the course of asthma and COPD (asthmaincidence, respiratory symptoms, lung function, hospital admissions and respiratory mortality) bystudying patient's series and the general population will be conducted. Its effect on asthma incidencewill be studied on the E3N cohort, on asthma severity in the EGEA survey and on various COPDrelated phenotypes in the new Spanish survey (PAC-COPD).Diet (JdB, IR, JG, RV,..) is a relatively new topic in respiratory epidemiology and few studieshave included proper assessment methods. There is still no concensus regarding the methods andactive research regarding analyses. Both Inserm and Creal have decided a few years ago to enter thisfield and due to a lack of local expertise have established a collaboration with an international expertin the field (I Romieu, a french researcher working in Mexico and currently on a sabbatical visit inCreal). Food frequency questionnaires adapted for France and Spain have been set up. Youngresearchers interested in the field are being trained in Creal and Inserm. Results already obtained inthe French E3N survey have shown the interest of dietary patterns, a new approach complementingthe food and nutrient approaches. It is planned to evaluate the effects of diet on the incidence and theseverity of asthma in studies conducted in children in Creal (INMA10), in adults in France (E3N andEGEA2 studies, and the exacerbations of COPD in the PAC-COPD study) Studies regarding the 9 E3N-asthma survey - Longitudinal survey of women affiliated with MGEN, a health insurance for teachers (coordinated by FClavel-Chapelon) - conducted in France Objective: Role of nutritional and hormonal factors for various diseases in women(mostly cancers, but also asthma and cardiovascular diseases) Population: 100 000 women, affiliated with MGEN, 40 to 65years of age.

Start birth, follow-up till 4 years of ageInserm - Creal14/546/06/06interactions between environmental exposures are planned as air pollution, smoking and occupationalhazards are a source of oxidants whereas some dietary patterns may be protective. A detailedprogram will be set up with RV (currently in a post doc in nutrition epidemiology in Harvard), regardingin particular the Egea2 and E3N surveys.Contact with animals, a particular aspect related to indoor exposure (MPO, JPZ, FK ..), hasbeen advocated as a protective factor for allergy (hygiene hypothesis) and is an active topic ofresearch in Europe. Research is currently conducted in various longitudinal studies in children toassess which specific agent (related to infectious agents) may be responsible of the delayedmaturation of the immune system towards a balance between Th1 and Th2 pattern favouring a proallergic Th2 pattern. A complementary line of research followed at Inserm is to evaluate long-termeffects in adulthood which needs to define appropriate assessments of contacts with livestock andpets over the life span. Geographical methods, based on birth place and agricultural census havebeen set up in France. Protective effects on allergy of living in the country and of early contacts withpets have been shown in adults from the EGEA survey. There are limited information regarding theinteraction of various indoor exposures. It is planned to evaluate the role of early exposure to livestockon the age of onset and severity of asthma in the E3N, Paarc11 and EGEA surveys, to assess the roleof the amount of exposure to pets and livestock over the lifespan on allergy and respiratory outcomesin EGEA2. Further work to improve exposure assessment possibly through geographical methodsapplicable in other countries is considered.3) Genetic determinants and genetics (MK, NK, JS, JMA, FK, VS, RN, MPO,..) has exploded in the last 10years in the respiratory field and the Inserm group has taken an important place in the field, byrealizing one of the first five genome screens for asthma in the EGEA study. It corresponds to a longterm committement in the field and the establishment of close cooperation with top-level groups ingenetics in France (Inserm U794, U535, more associationstudies have been developped in the EGEA study, a major study in the field of respiratory geneticswhich by its design combining a case control and a family approach is particularly adapted to a varietyof analyses. The genetic program of the EGEA study (coordinated by F Demenais, Inserm U794)includes two genome a fine-mapping program by microsatellites and SNPS and anassociation program on a variety of candidate genes currently underway. It will be complemented soonby a transcriptomic approach. In parallel, the Creal group has developped a program on associationstudies for asthma in the context of the ECRHS. All groups belong to the Gabriel european IP (aeuropean project on asthma genetics). Creal is part of the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park a newscientific strategic project of the Catalan Government that includes several groups of internationalreputation on regulatory genomics. It is planned to study gene by environment interactions in specific pathways. The pathwayapproach is the specificity of respiratory epidemiology groups working with genetic groups. Thecollaboration is close between both and some respiratory epidemiologists are already trained insophisticated genetic analyses (VS). Candidate genes would be chosen in pathways related to COPDand asthma such as oxidative, nitrosative, immune tolerance and inflammatory pathways. Forrespiratory phenotypes, relevant environmental factors to be studied jointly will be oxidant-richenvironment such as smoking or occupational exposure (possibly disinfectants), and traffic related airpollution. Similarly interaction with dietary patterns with high antioxidant intake is of interest. Regardingthe association of exposure to livestock and pets with allergic markers and asthma, potential geneticmodifiers in the innate immune pathway (in particular controlling Tregulatory cells) will be investigated.Interest in new biomarkers (RN, MPO, FK, JPZ, JG, ..) is currently developped at theinternational level, but not like genetic approaches despite their potential to improve phenotypiccharacterisation. Both Inserm and Creal have been among the first to include exhaled breathcondensate collections in studies conducted in the last years. Such non invasive methods could allowto assess in situ inflammation, and potentially more sophisticated measures, such as cytokine levels.Work conducted in the context of the Ga2len network suggests that proteomic approaches in EBC 11 PAARC - Pollution atmosph\u00e9rique et Affections Respiratoires Chroniques.

Inserm and Creal are developping phenotypic characterisation based onbiological measures, in particular in the EGEA2 survey in asthma, in the new PAC-COPD survey onCOPD patients and in the study on the respiratory health effects in fishermen participating in clean-upactivities of the Prestige oil spill12.It is planned to develop a coherent program regarding the analysis of exhaled condensate invarious settings, to explore the possibilities of proteomic approaches in serum (pilot studies inprogress with CNG) and possibly in EBC, to measure enzyme activities, in particular regarding theantioxidant defence, and more generally to develop a greater use of biomarkers in respiratoryepidemiology in conjunction with a biological pathway approach and in connection with geneticprograms.PrioritiesAmong the various topics which will contribute to the project, we have identified priority areaswhere we can focus efforts in a more defined way. They have been chosen due to their timeliness andbecause they represent areas at the crossing of the expertise of the associated laboratories.1. Epidemiological approaches to refine phenotyping in asthma and COPDThe lack of a valid definition of asthma has been a persistent drawback of clinical andepidemiological respiratory research. Most epidemiological studies on asthma and COPD have reliedupon questionnaires, lung function with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and markers of allergy, suchas atopy and IgE levels13 14 15 16. More recently, phenotypes of interest of great clinical relevance suchas asthma severity or COPD exacerbations have been studied through epidemiological approachesand Inserm and Imim have played a pioneer role in this field17 18. In parallel, advances in cellular andmolecular medicine have increased the knowledge about the intermediate phenotypes including thecharacterization of Th1 and Th2 inflammation patterns and remodelling changes in the airways.Molecular phenotyping using non invasive methods such as induced sputum19 and exhaled breathcondensate are particularly interesting at the epidemiological and clinical levels. Both institutions havebeen among the first to incorporate such methods in epidemiological studies (EGEA, Prestige).Furthermore, the recent advancement in genomics has projected renewed interest in understandingthe phenotypes of asthma and COPD as associations between candidate genes may substantiallydiffer according to which disease definitions or phenotype variants are used.Both asthma and COPD need reconsideration of their phenotypic characteristics, limits andheterogeneity at the various phases of the diseases over the life span. Improving the epidemiologicaldefinition and characterization of chronic bronchial obstructive diseases is a priority. Problems to befaced include the incorporation to epidemiological studies of new biological markers and classicalissues like assessing validity, reliability, inter-laboratory comparability. In response to these challengesboth groups have recently undertaken large collaborative studies with the group of Inserm focusing onsevere asthma (EGEA Study) and the group of Barcelona on COPD (The PAC-COPD study). 12 Prestige study - Follow-up study conducted in fishermen who participated to the cleaning and controls, including lungfunction tests and exhaled breath condensate13 Kauffmann F.

Gene environment interactions in asthma and COPDCOPD and asthma are major environmental diseases. The recent increase in asthma is due toenvironmental changes. Numerous deleterious and protective environmental factors may be riskfactors of the disease, trigger of asthma attacks, cause of fatal outbreaks and more generally involvedin the evolution ot the disease20 21 22. Not all smokers get COPD. Some effects are of overall lowmagnitude. Asthma triggers, COPD exacerbations related to environment are observed in subgroupsof patients. It is well known that asthma run in families and COPD has a familial component. Extremelyactive research is going on worldwide regarding asthma genetics and in a markedly less extent forCOPD, with a current development based on large-scale association studies, potentially covering theentire genome. Strong genetic methodology has been used mostly by genetically driven groups, withthe initial idea of finding a small number of major genes. Now there is a consensus to consider thatthere are many genes with relatively small effects. Although positional cloning has appearedsuccessful in the field23, a lot of observations appear discordant, due to insufficient consideration ofphenotype heterogeneity, and population differences. Evidence is accumulating of the extremecomplexity of the interactions, in which specific phenotype, environment, genes, and even time(windows of exposure, windows of phenotypic expression) are essential24.Research on joint effects of genes and environmental factors (gene environment\"interactions\"), although advocated to be central by many groups, is only starting and very fewconvincing results have been obtained25 26. Respiratory epidemiology is a key domain to explore suchaspects due to the strength of the associations with environment. A systemic approach is needed totackle the underlying complexity. Epidemiology has therefore an essential role to play through itscapacity to delineate complex problems, by looking at large populations, and integrative approachesincluding statistics, clinical aspects, very careful assessment of environment, and analytical strategynot based on a priori defined constructs. The Barcelona group is extremely experienced regardingenvironment and, in particular for other diseases, has published key findings in gene environmentinteraction27. The group in Villejuif is leading for now 12 years one of the major studies on asthmacombining genetic and environmental approaches and has close collaborations with top level groupsin genetics28. 20 Le Moual N, Siroux V, Pin I, Kauffmann F, Kennedy S on behalf of EGEA.

A coordination team integrated by one person from each country will be set up(FK,JMA) and will both stimulate and coordinate the process. Specific roles of the coordination teamwill be: i) planning and monitoring the development of the process, ii) planning and coordinating sitevisits, iii) dealing with the institutional necessary agreements, iv) looking for funding to facilitateexchange and mobility across groups. As shown in the scientific program, each topic is coordinated bya binational team who takes care of organizing and monitoring the different activities.Type of activitiesAchieving the overall aims will depend on a number of common activities undertaken by themembers of the three groups. These activities will include: i) visits of senior researchers to othergroups, ii) exchanges of junior and postdoctoral researchers, starting with the \"poste vert\" fromInserm, iii) co-supervision of doctoral students, iv) common applications to national or Europeanfunding, iv) writing common papers.Time-planThree phases have been defined.1) September 2005 - April 2006: Exploratory/feasibility phase- Definition of areas of common interests and first strategic plan- Short term visits and exchanges including mutual invitations to internal meetings of majorstudies conducted in the other country, namely ECRHS, E3N, EGEA- Preparation of the first common Inserm-Creal/Ga2len meetingThis phase has been successfully completed (see appendix 1)The first common meeting held in April 2006 showed the feasibility of the project. Short-termcollaborative projects and lines for more ambitious aspects have been defined2) May- December 2006 : Starting period: exploiting current common interestsIn the starting period, common activities will follow the current lines of activities. It isanticipated that it will consolidate the potential of collaboration on a long-term basis, help to define aworking research plan focussed on the priorities and set up the conditions for its implementation. Chronic obstructive respiratory diseases in adults- Plan a case-case study between EGEA and ECRHS (definition of asthma in longitudinalstudies for genetic analyses), involving respiratory epidemiologists and chest physicians- Develop exchanges regarding COPD epidemiologyEnvironmental determinants of respiratory health- Data access to develop physical activity themes (E3N, in collaboration with researchersalready involved in nutrition effects on asthma in that study) -

october 2006Others aspects- Explore the relevance of a quality management approach (ISO certification-like) in Creal,along lines followed in France in the context of European biological resource centre in asthma -starting June 2006- Set-up statistical \"clinics\" - Defining biostatistical problems encountered particularly in Crealto be discussed with a senior biostatistician from Inserm - starting may 2006- Assess the administrative constraints which may limit the development of the program suchas regarding common applications to national grants and find project management help at thatadministrative level- Increase language knowledge in Spanish or Catalan at Inserm and in French at Creal(greater need at Inserm for now) to decrease dependence to English in a project based in two latincountries.- Evaluate and improve management and coordination -3) January - December 2007: Developing \"de novo\" research initiatives based on agreedpriorities.Although this part will largely depend on the success and consolidation of step 2, some of theinitiatives that can be anticipated are the following:- Phenotyping aspects in chronic obstructive respiratory diseases in adults- Plan common analyses on the ECRHS and EGEA longitudinal studies- Assess interest and limitations of improving phenotypic (respiratory, potentially lung function)(as well as environmental, in particular regarding cleaning) characterisation in the E3N study, apotential setting for case-cohort studies on severe asthma and COPDInserm - Creal19/546/06/06- Environmental determinants of respiratory health and gene environment interactions- Develop data analysis regarding cleaning in the E3N study at Inserm in collaboration withresearchers from Creal, and evaluate how to develop an overall coherent international program on therisks of cleaning and assess areas for studies on gene environment research in that area- Develop coherent nutrition epidemiological research in respiratory diseases and assesspossibilities of studies on gene environment studies in that area.- Assess the possibilities of common work regarding gene environment interaction regardingrisks associated with early exposure to livestock and pets- Other General aspects:- Development of analyses with writing of at least 2 common papers- Exchanges of researchers (post doc and/or junior and/or senior)- Explore exchanges and codirections at the doctoral level- Second common Inserm-Creal/Ga2len meeting- Explore the need and feasibilityof organising a European course in respiratory epidemiology- Evaluate and improve management and coordination- Explore beyond the current Inserm groups (such as Institut F\u00e9d\u00e9ratif de site or researchcenter) and Creal (Imim and Barcelona Biomedical Research Park in Barcelona) the potentials tostrengthen the scientific activities of the proposed International laboratory of RespiratoryEpidemiology.Milestones / indicatorsMilestones will be 1) the obtention of the Inserm approval and further recognition by othernational and international bodies, the efficiency of the management structure, the obtention ofappropriate authorizations for data access 2) the publication of the first paper and the obtention of thefirst grant derived from this proposal 3) the set-up of a common program or major phase of an existingprogram underway 4) the recruitment of a researcher setting up a binational program.Indicators will be 1) the number of persons and days spent at the other institution(exchange), 2) the number of shared communications presented to meetings, 3) number of sharedpapers published in international journals, 4) international workshops organised commonly 5) thenumber of junior and senior researchers from other countriescoming in one of the institutions for asabbatical period (visibility and attractiveness), 4) the stability and sustainability of research programs,increase in the quality and impact of research.Inserm -
