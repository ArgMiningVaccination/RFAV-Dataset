McPhillips-Tangum, Averhoff, MD, MPH, and Kelly Howell, MPH Background: Although early childhood vaccination rates have increased, many adolescents are not up to date on recommended vaccinations. We assessed attitudes and practices of family physicians and pedia- tricians regarding adolescent vaccination to identify provider-level barriers that may contribute to lowimmunization rates. Methods: A 94-item self-report questionnaire was mailed to 400 physicians contracted with a man- aged care organization. Physicians were queried about demographic characteristics, source of vaccine recommendations, adolescent immunization practices, barriers to immunizing adolescents, and use ofreminder/recall systems. Results: Response rate was 59%. Most respondents reported routinely recommending vaccines for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (98%), Hepatitis B (90%), 60% routinely recommended varicella vaccine. Physicians reported that they were more likelyto assess immunization status, administer indicated immunizations, and schedule return immunizationvisits to younger adolescents (11 to 13 years old) than to older adolescents (14 to 18 and 19 to 21years old). Conclusion: Most respondents reported recommending the appropriate vaccinations during preven- tive health visits; however, older adolescents were least likely to be targeted for immunization assess-ment and administration of all recommended vaccines. (J Am Board Fam Pract 2005;18:13-9.) Adolescent immunization rates remain low despite the success of infant and childhood vaccinationprograms. Although routine adolescent immuniza-tions have been recommended since 1996, an esti-mated 35 million adolescents (ie, persons 11 to 21years of age, as dened by the American MedicalAssociation and the American Academy of Pediat-rics) lack one or more recommended vaccinations,placing them at risk for developing vaccine-pre-ventable disease. 1-3Factors contributing to low im - munization rates include missed opportunities, lackof population-based immunization registries that include adolescents, low public and peer awarenessabout immunization coverage in this age group,misperceptions about vaccine safety, and lack ofknowledge about the importance of immuniza-tions. 1- 4In addition, adolescents are one of the most difcult groups to reach for vaccination andother preventive services, in part because growingnumbers lack a primary care provider and adoles-cents, in general, have fewer contacts with physi-cians. 1,5- 6 Overcoming barriers at the provider level is cru- cial to increasing adolescent immunization rates.Previous studies have shown that lack of a providerrecommendation is often cited as a reason for notreceiving an immunization and that provider atti-tude and recommendation are strong predictors of vaccination of high-risk patients and indeed may bethe most important determinants of immunizationstatus. 7-9 The Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion (CDC) recommend that all previously unvac-cinated adolescents receive tetanus and diphtheria(Td) toxoids, varicella vaccine (if no history of nat-ural disease), hepatitis B, and measles, mumps, andSubmitted, revised, 17 August 2004.

Methods Study PopulationIn May 1999, we obtained a computerized list of allgeneral physicians, family physicians, and pediatri-cians actively contracted with a national MCO; thelist included name, address, phone number, gender,specialty, date of birth, and year of medical schoolgraduation. At the time the survey was conducted,the MCO had 4.9 million members in 28 states andthe District of Columbia and contracted with ap-proximately 34,000 physicians. Eligibility criteriaincluded a stated specialty in pediatrics, familypractice, or general practice and record of a com-plete mailing address, including street, city, state,and zip code. Based on a minimum expected re-sponse rate of 40%, a sample of 400 physicians wasrandomly selected to receive a questionnaire. Thissample size was chosen to provide a power of 80%to detect a difference of 20% between specialtieswith an /H9251of 0.05. Questionnaires were sent to physicians in 28 states and the District of Colum-bia. Physicians did not receive an incentive forparticipating in the survey. Questionnaire A 94-item self-administered questionnaire was de-veloped, piloted, revised and mailed to each physi-cian in May 1999 by a health care research centerafliated with the MCO. Nonresponders were sentfollow-up mailings in June 1999. Respondents re-turned the questionnaire to the research center viaa self-addressed envelope mailed with the survey. The questionnaire included demographic ques- tions, source of physician's vaccine recommenda-tions, questions regarding adolescent immuniza-tion practices, barriers to immunizing adolescents,the degree of importance placed on ensuring thatadolescents were up to date (UTD) on immuniza-tions, and tracking or reminder/recall systems usedby the provider ofce. Physicians who did not pro-vide care to adolescent patients were asked to indi-cate this on the survey and complete only the de-mographic portion of the survey. Most questionswere xed response; several open-ended questionswere included and later converted to multioutcomeresponses. Each questionnaire included the name of the physician and a study identication number. Indi-vidual identifying information was omitted afterreceipt of the questionnaire; thus, questionnairesremained condential, although not anonymous, atall times. The study design for this project was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Pruden-tial Center for Health Care Research. (When thisresearch was conducted, the Emory Center onHealth Outcomes and Quality was known as ThePrudential Center for Health Care Research, whichbecame the USQA Center for Health Care Re-search; in 2001, it was transferred to Emory Uni-versity to form the Emory Center on Health Out-comes and Quality.) Analysis Continuous data were collapsed into categories andcategorical data were dichotomized before analysis.Simple associations were tested using a /H9273 2test of association and corresponding pvalues are re- ported. A pvalue of .05 was used as the level of statistical signicance. All analysis was conducted inSAS (version 8.02; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Results Attributes of RespondentsForty of the 400 physicians who were mailed aquestionnaire were ineligible: one physician nolonger worked at the practice, 12 indicated thatthey did not provide care to adolescents, and 27questionnaires were undeliverable. Two surveyswere received from general physicians but wereremoved from the analysis because of the smallnumber of responses from that specialty. Of theremaining 358 physicians, 210 questionnaires werereturned for a response rate of 59%. Respondents and nonrespondents did not differ signicantly with respect to age, gender, or year ofmedical school graduation but did differ in spe-cialty. Pediatricians [97 of 145 (67%)] were morelikely to return the questionnaire than were family 14JABFP January-February 2005 Vol. 18 No. 1 http://www.jabfp.org on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Demo- graphic characteristics of survey respondents and nonrespondents are shown in Table 1. Source of Vaccine Recommendations Respondents were asked to select all their sourcesof vaccine recommendations from a checklist. Pe-diatricians were more likely than family physiciansto indicate the American Academy of Pediatrics(99% vs 48%, P/H11021.05) and the Advisory Commit- tee on Immunization Practices (55% vs 23%, P/H11021 .05) as their source of vaccine recommendations,whereas more family physicians than pediatriciansindicated the American Academy of Family Physi-cians as their source of recommendations (81% vs7%, P/H11021.05) (Table 2). Vaccines Routinely Recommended for AdolescentsOf the 210 respondents, 98% reported that theyroutinely recommended Td 90% routinelyrecommended vaccine, rec-ommended MMR and 60% routinely recommended varicella vaccine (Table 2). Pediatri-cians were more likely than family physicians toreport recommending hepatitis B (99% vs 82%,P/H11021.05) and varicella (80% vs 42%, P/H11021.05) vaccines; there were no differences by specialty inrecommendation rates for Td and MMR. One hundred and thirteen (54%) respondents indicated that they routinely recommended all 4vaccines of interest (ie, Td, MMR, hepatitis B, andvaricella), whereas 64 (30%) routinely recom-mended 3 vaccines, 23 (11%) routinely recom- mended 2 vaccines, 9 (4%) routinely recommendedonly one of the vaccines, and 1 ( /H110210.05%) respon- dent did not routinely recommend any of the vac-cines. More pediatricians than family physicians(72% vs 38%) reported that they routinely recom-mended all 4 vaccines. Immunization Activities Included in Preventive Health VisitsWhen asked what immunization activities (ie, as-sess immunization status, administer needed immu-nizations, and schedule return immunization visit)were typically included in preventive health visitsfor adolescents aged 11 to 13, 14 to 18, and 19 to 21years, results varied by age group (Table 2). Re-spondents reported that they conducted more im-munization assessments during preventive healthvisits for adolescents aged 11 to 13 (94%) and 14 to18 years (91%) compared with adolescents aged 19to 21 years (74%). Likewise, more respondents reported administering needed immunizations toadolescents aged 11 to 13 years (96%) and 14 to 18years (95%) than to adolescents 19 to 21 years ofage (77%). However, more family physicians thanpediatricians reported that they administeredneeded immunizations for adolescents aged 19 to21 years (84% vs 69%, P/H11021.05). Only 60% of respondents indicated that they scheduled returnimmunization visits for adolescents aged 19 to 21years, compared with adolescents aged 11 to 13years (78%) and 14 to 18 years (74%). Proportion of Adolescents UTP on Vaccine- Preventable DiseasePediatricians were more likely than family physi-cians to report that /H1135075% of their adolescent pa- tients were up to date on Td toxoids, hepatitis Bvaccine, and varicella vaccine, whereas there wereno differences between the specialties with respectto receipt of MMR (Table 2). In addition, 14% ofrespondents reported that 75% or more of theiradolescent patients were UTD on all 4 vaccine-preventable diseases of interest, 21% indicated thesame for 3 diseases, 30% for 2 diseases, and 13%for 1 disease; 21% reported that /H1135075% of their adolescent patients were not UTD on any of thediseases of interest.Table 1.

Downloaded from Use of Reminder and Recall System Only 18% of family physicians and 28% of pedia-tricians reported that their practice used a trackingor reminder/recall system to identify and contactadolescents who were due or overdue for immuni-zations (Table 2). There were no differences invaccine recommendations between respondentswho used a reminder/recall system and those whodid not, except with respect to hepatitis B recom-mendation. Of the 47 respondents who reportedthat they used a reminder/recall system, 100% rou-tinely recommended hepatitis B vaccine, comparedwith 140 (88%) of 160 who reported that they didnot use a recall/reminder system ( P/H11021.05).

Downloaded from 43%, P/H11021.05) reported \"difcult to obtain veri- cation of previous immunization\" as a barrier. For adolescents aged 11 to 13 years, more family phy-sicians indicated \"adolescents not aware of need forimmunizations\" (62% vs 45%, P/H11021.05) as a barrier than did pediatricians. In addition, more familyphysicians reported \"adolescents rarely visits\" (74% vaccine\" (21% vs11%, P/H11021.05) as barriers for adolescents aged 19 to 21; however, more pediatricians than family physi-cians found \"adolescents seek care from other fa-cilities\" to be a barrier for adolescents aged 19 to 21(41% vs 26%, P/H11021.05). With the exception of the barriers \"difcult to determine adolescents at risk,\" \"adolescents/par-ents refuse vaccination,\" and \"obtaining consentper state law,\" more respondents reported that theyexperienced barriers for adolescents aged 19 to 21 years compared with adolescents aged 11 to 13 and14 to 18 years (P /H11021.05). When we stratied by the number of barriers experienced, more family phy-sicians reported experiencing 7 or more barriers foradolescents 19 to 21 than did pediatricians (54% vs46%, P/H11021.05). There were no differences by spe- cialty in the number of barriers for adolescentsaged 11 to 13 or 14 to 18 years.Discussion The survey results suggest that most physicians recommend the appropriate vaccinations to theiradolescent patients and typically include immuni-zation activities in preventive health visits. Bothpediatricians and family physicians report that theyexperience barriers to adolescent immunization,particularly as adolescents aged. Family physiciansreported experiencing more barriers for older ad-olescents compared with pediatricians; however, itis likely that more adolescents aged 19 to 21 seekcare from primary care physicians than from pedi-atricians. Respondents, in particular family physicians, consistently placed less importance on varicellavaccine compared with hepatitis B, MMR, and Td.For example, only 68% of respondents overall re-ported that it was \"very important\" to ensure thatadolescents were UTD on protection against vari-cella, whereas 86% to 97% reported the same re-garding hepatitis B, MMR, and Td. In addition,most respondents (84% to 98%) reported that theyroutinely recommended hepatitis MMR, andTd, whereas fewer (60%) reported routinely rec-ommending varicella vaccine, even though only31% of respondents felt that most (ie, /H1135075%) of their adolescent patients were UTD on their pro-tection against varicella compared with 69% who reported the same for MMR and Td. This disparitymay stem from the fact that varicella vaccine isrelatively new\u2014less than 3 years had elapsed be-tween our survey and the CDC's recommendationto administer varicella vaccine to adolescents with-out a history of natural disease, and the vaccine hadonly been licensed and available for use in theUnited States for an additional 15 months. 10,11Ad- herence to varicella vaccine recommendations facesseveral additional challenges: there is a lack of di-rect medical cost savings, previous surveys havefound that some physicians are concerned aboutwaning immunity after vaccination and may prefernatural disease over vaccination, and varicella isgenerally a benign illness, with rare complications.In addition, previous studies indicate that physi-cians are concerned that varicella may shift frombeing a childhood disease to primarily an adultdisease, where the complications are greater. 10,12-16 To the best of our knowledge, only one previous survey has been conducted assessing physicianpractices with regard to adolescent immuniza-Table 3.

Downloaded from tion.17Our survey sample was randomly selected and national in scope, surveying physicians in 28 states and the District of Columbia. In addition,both pediatricians and family physicians were in-cluded. Despite the strengths of the study, therewere at least 3 limitations. First, we did not verifythrough chart review whether self-reported prac-tice reflected actual practice; thus, the true level ofcare was not independently veried. Second, ourstudy sample was small (n /H11005358). Last, although the response rate was nearly 60%, and respondentsand nonrespondents were demographically similar,it is possible that they differed in their immuniza-tion practices. This study provides a basic framework for un- derstanding physicians' attitudes and practices withregard to adolescent immunization, as well as iden-tifying barriers encountered at the provider level.Improvement is needed in knowledge about vari-cella vaccine use, use of reminder/recall systems,and overcoming barriers to immunizing older ad-olescents, particularly among family physicians.Table 4.
