My routine did change slightly when I became a professional snowboarder, as I began doing workouts that more closely catered to the muscle groups that I utilize most when I'm competing. I'm fortunate in that I don't solely tie my workouts to snowboarding, so I know that even when I do decide to move on from this sport, I'll continue making exercise a priority. I love the feeling both during and after a good workout and the satisfaction of knowing that I'm taking care of my body in the best way possible.\" -Arielle Gold, 22, Steamboat Springs, CO, [Olympic snowboarder](http://www.teamusa.org/us-ski-and-snowboard/athletes/arielle-gold) \"Growing up as a dancer, exercise was always a part of my life. For me, it is such a vital part of being the best version of myself. When I am working out in a joyous, challenging way, I am more mentality, spiritually, and emotionally healthy, and that holistic impact is so important to me.\" -Simone De La Rue, 44, Los Angeles, celebrity trainer and creator of [Body by Simone](http://www.instagram.com/bodybysimone/) \"Working out is one of my biggest passions. I love challenging my body and my mind by pushing myself to new limits every time I step into the gym. I am a very competitive person, and ever since I gave up collegiate volleyball, I have looked to strength training and powerlifting to allow myself to compete against myself each day. It's my favorite part of my day because it allows me to focus on myself and forget about all of the other chaos going on around me.\" -Bailey, 21, Minnesota, [certified personal trainer](http://www.instagram.com/bodyfitbalance/) and nursing student \"I grew up dancing. When I got to college, I realized I didn't want to compete professionally, but I still wanted dance to be a major part of my life. After a few years of not dancing on a regular basis and trying to supplement it with other types of physical activity, I realized how much I missed it. I started going to Zumba regularly, and now through my gym, I go to at least four different types of dance fitness classes a week. It feels so good to be back!\" -Mariel, 25, Cambridge, MA, tutor and graduate student \"As a kid, I was always active whether it was dance, lacrosse, tennis, or golf. You name it, I did it. When I went to college, I wasn't really sure how to continue my fitness let alone stay healthy. I wanted to get leaner and stronger, so after trial and error, I joined a Pilates studio near home. It's honestly the best decision I've made.\" -Samantha, 23, Horsham, PA, merchandising \"Health and fitness has always played an important part in my life, even while growing up. The combination of fueling my body with nutrient rich foods and being active in some way every day makes me feel more energized and confident both mentally and physically. I want to help women focus on their health and fitness to improve the way they feel because I believe it is important for all women to feel strong, empowered, and confident in themselves and everything they do, every single day.\" -Kayla Itsines, 27, Adelaide, "}
