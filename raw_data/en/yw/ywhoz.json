Apart from functioning as the information bearer, chromatin also integrates external signals and regulates the manifestation of this information. It has been shown by various studies that chromatin organization is dynamic, however, shows several non-random features which are driven by both active and passive components. Different regulatory processes e.g., chromatin remodeling, transcription activation and silencing, DNA repair etc., modify the 3D-genome organization. In this project we will study how these dynamic processes which act locally, at nucleosome/gene level, would affect the overall global chromatin organization. Our approach will be to integrate active mechanics and polymer-physics based models with experimental data obtained from sequencing (such as Hi-C adn ChIP-seq) and imaging techniques. | | | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Mechanisms regulating lung cell homeostasis and cellular remodeling are thought to be essential for reversing lung damage and restoring health. For example, several distinct populations of differentiated cells in the respiratory tract contribute toward the replacement of cells that are lost due to wear-and-tear and/or injury. As part of the Regulation of Cell Fate Theme at inStem, our goal over the past several years has been to understand how cellular plasticity in the lung is regulated. I will present our findings, derived from studies in mice and fruit flies, that signals like Notch and Wnt actively control the states of differentiated cells. Downregulation of these signals lead to alterations in cell states in the respective models. Ongoing research in the laboratory aims to deconstruct the role of the tissue microenvironment in the regulation of cellular plasticity, to broaden our understanding of how plasticity can contribute toward lung homeostasis, and to extend these findings to the human lung. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| To successfully invade new hosts, break host resistance, and move within and between plants, viruses, and their satellites have evolved a coordinated network of protein interactions. Beta C1 (\u00ce\u00b2C1) protein encoded by specific geminiviruses acts as a key pathogenicity determinant in systemic infection. \u00ce\u00b2C1 from diverse viruses undergoes multiple Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs), prominently ubiquitination and phosphorylation, inside the host cells. However, the relevance of these and other layers of PTMs has not been well understood. Here we identified the significance of novel SUMOylation and SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) of Synedrella Yellow Vein Clearing Virus (SyYVCV) \u00ce\u00b2C1. We observed that SyYVCV \u00ce\u00b2C1 undergoes SUMOylation in plants and its SIMs assist in this modification. Mutants of \u00ce\u00b2C1 in SUMO or SIM domains compromised function by altering its stability and function. In vivo studies indicated that mutants of \u00ce\u00b2C1 are unable to promote viral replication due to altered protein interaction and localization. SUMOylation in different motifs of \u00ce\u00b2C1 led to functionally non-redundant outcomes directly deciding the stability of the \u00ce\u00b2C1 protein. Further, extending our understanding of the biochemical and functional role of \u00ce\u00b2C1 during plant\u00e2virus interaction, we discovered a new cellular interactor of \u00ce\u00b2C1 called with RecA1 in plants and its homolog in bacteria to reduce the ability of host cells to maintain genomic integrity under stresses. Reduction in the coding capacity of plastids severely affected retrograde signalling necessary for viral perception and activation of defense. Induction of chloroplast-specific nuclease by \u00ce\u00b2C1 is akin to phosphate starvation-response in which nucleotides are recycled to augment the synthesis of new, potentially viral, DNA. Our results indicate the presence of a novel strategy in which a viral protein alters host defence by targeting regulators of chloroplast DNA and hijacks host PTM machinery to regulate the function of its pathogenicity protein. We predict that the mechanism identified here might have similarities in other plant-pathogen interactions. 1.

RNA localization, interactions with partners and even the lifetime of RNA in the cell are thought to be influenced by its structure. Over the years, my group has developed various capabilities that let us identify, analyze, probe, compare and visualize RNA structure, with the broader goal of understanding how structure enables function. In this talk, I will highlight specific studies from my lab where using structure-inspired approaches we have discovered families of non-coding regulatory RNAs in bacteria. Our work helps understand their mechanisms of translational control, their partnership with signaling proteins and ultimately their function in cells. Ongoing efforts in my lab seek to identify RNA families that coordinate with metabolic enzymes to determine cellular responses. Finally, understanding the principles of structural switching in natural RNAs allows the design of synthetic RNA switches that regulate translation. I will elaborate upon work from my lab where we couple whole-genome local RNA structure analysis with synthetic RNA switches and use this for specific nucleic-acid detection. 11:30 AM, Monday, Jan 17, 2022 | Remote VCThesis Seminar by Ms Sahana of Purkinje gap junction protein in larval zebrafish' 10:00 AM, Tuesday, Feb 01, 2022 | Remote VCThesis Seminar by Ms Sucheta Kulkarni on 'Identifying novel molecules which regulate the presynaptic vesicle transport pathway and role of UNC-16 in neuronal regeneration' 10:15 AM, Thursday, Feb 10, 2022 Remote VCSeminar by Dr Dhandapany Perundurai on 'Cardio Genomics and Precision Medicine' 10:15 AM, Tuesday, Feb 15, 2022 | Remote VCTalk by Dr Harsha G Suresh unanchored polyubiquitin chains and protein homeostasis' 09:30 AM, Monday, Feb 21, 2022 | Remote VCThesis Seminar by Ms Bharti Nawalpuri protein 03:00 PM, Monday, Feb 2022 Seminar by Mr Ashutosh Shukla on 'Stress, Amygdala and Innate Responses to Emotionally Salient Ultrasonic Vocalization Calls in Rats' 03:00 PM, Monday, Feb 28, 2022 | Remote VCTalk by Prof K.
