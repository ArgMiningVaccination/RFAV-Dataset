Homeopathic prophylaxis is NOT a substitute for pharmaceutical vaccination. Some Clinical History: In 1974, during an outbreak of meningococcal disease in Brazil, 18,640 children were protectd homeopathically against meningococcal infection, and 6,340 were not. The following results were obtained: 18,640 protected homeopathically - 4 cases of Meningococcal infection. Based on the infection (attack) rate in the unprotected group, 94 cases of infection should have been expected in the homeopathically protected group. Instead, there were only four - the homeopathic option had been 95% effective against meningicoccal disease. Study 2 The results of the first study led to the Brazilian government funding a larger study in 1998. It was conducted by two Professors of Medicine from the University Foundation in Blumenau, Brazil, and a Blumenau specialist physician and Health City Secretary. A total of 65,826 people between the ages of 0-20 were protected homeopathically against meningococcal disease while 23,532 were not. Over a 12 month period, the following results were obtained: 65,826 protected homeopathically - 4 cases of meningococcal infection. 23,532 not protected - 20 cases of meningococcal infection. Based on the infection (attack) rate in the unprotected group, approximately 58 cases of infection should have been expected in the homeopathically protected group. Instead, there were only four. Statistical analysis showed that the prophylactic gave 95% protection against the disease in the first six months and 91% protection over the year. It is also interesting to note that the researchers of this study were at pains to point out that the use of Meningococcinum for protection against meningococcal disease was not a new development in Brazil. They have also provided another 10 references to their country's use of prophylactics. Homeopathic Immunization in Cuba THE PREVENTION OF EPIDEMIC LEPTOSPIROSIS IN CUBA Cuba goes through a yearly cycle of Leptospirosis epidemic, especially after the hurricanes flood the countryside and water pollution reaches its height. (Leptospirosis: infectious disease caused by the spirochaete Leptospira transmitted to humans from rats, giving jaundice and kidney damage. Can cause death) Annually the population is exposed to the disease, most especially after hurricanes. Until Aug 2007, the Finlay Institute (a part of the Ministry of Public Health, Cuba) has been distributing its own allopathic Lepto vaccination. August is the height of the hurricane season. Annually, many are left homeless, flooded out and under the stress of disaster situation. There had been a sharp rise in the lepto epidemic. The usual expectacy of infection even with allopathic vaccination would have been around a few thousands, with some deaths included. Part of the reason for this is that the high cost of vaccination prevents putting but the most at-risk populations (ie children, pregnant women, elderly) on vaccination. The cost of such limited vaccination is about US $3,000.000. But in Aug 2007, Finlay put approximately 5,000,000 people (5 million) in 2 provinces on homeopathic nosode prophylaxis at the cost of about only US $200,000. That figure represents the entire population of the 2 provinces. The Homeopathic Prophylaxis consisted of 2 single doses about 2 weeks apart. But this time, within 2 weeks after Aug 2007, the rising lines literally dropped off the chart to ten infections only! Zero deaths from leptospirosis after Aug 2007. And in 2008, no deaths, infections less than 10 a month. The Cuban team readily admits that they have not invented anything new as far as homeopathic philosophy or application. They have simply followed what we homeopaths know to work. And since they have no pharmaceutical multi-nationals to stop them, they were able to do it on a massive scale unknown in the history of homeopathy.
