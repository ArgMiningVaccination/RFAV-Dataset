Renuvia works from within to bring effective ingredients in a small daily capsule. CERAMIDES & HYALURONIC ACID You may recognize Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and ceramides from many skincare products. They are very legitimate ingredients if used properly, both topically and orally. The tricky thing is though, not all ingredients are created equal. Without getting too scientific, HA exists in different molecular weights. Some of these are cheaper and used for topicals for their better absorption into skin from the outside, and others are more expensive and better for oral use. We use the patented, vegan, oral form of HA at the clinically researched dose shown to improve dry skin and reduce wrinkles. We also use a specific form of ceramides that are beneficial via oral administration to support skin moisture.
