It will enable you to lift up your life and get free of social conditioning that has been crippling us all for thousands of years. In addition, the book will show you how many of the complications to health brought about by medical procedures and drugs over the last century, based on false understandings, can be resolved. Ten common homeopathic remedies in very high (mega)potencies, can release commonly stored emotions, attitudes and false beliefs, thus allowing the body to heal itself of a wide range of physical complaints. Read what these crippling beliefs are, how they have allowed us to be led along, like lambs to the slaughter by the nose, into a cul-de-sac of personal, social and medical ignorance - and what you can do to get your life back on track. Healing your emotions, freeing yourself of your accumulated emotional baggage and getting your life on track, is not traumatic, not a slow process, does not require intense investigation into your childhood nor the re-experiencing of harrowing traumas. It does not require hours or years of counselling, psychology, hypnosis, auto-suggestion, religious conversion, past-life therapy, meditation, vegetarianism, self-analysis, relationship analysis, praying, New Year resolutions, will-power, months in the wilderness or sailing singlehanded around the world. Getting Back On Track shows you true healing. Not the way to unrestrained, detrimental emotions, not the way to violent outbursts of anger or floods of tears of grief, not the way to guilt-free irresponsibility. None of these is healthy, either. What you will get is personal growth, so that new insight gives you freedom from anger, freedom from grief, freedom from guilt, freedom from fear, and with this freedom, a new strength to take positive steps towards your own, and therefore planetary, healing. - Author: [Jill R Turland](/browse-by/author/jill-r-turland/) - ISBN: 9781951670009 - 363 pages - Paperback - Published in 2003 - Printed in United States "}
