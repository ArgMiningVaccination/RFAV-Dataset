It is based on the understanding that if obstacles to cure are removed, the human body has the innate ability to heal itself. Naturopathic Medicine is based on the following principles: The Healing Power of Nature Trust in the body's inherent wisdom to heal itself. Identify and Treat the Causes Look beyond the symptoms to the underlying cause. First Do No Harm Utilize the most natural, least invasive and least toxic therapies. Doctor as Teacher Educate patients in the steps to achieving and maintaining health. Treat the Whole Person View the body as an integrated whole in all its physical and spiritual dimensions. Prevention Focus on overall health, wellness and disease prevention. The latest \"buzz\" in medicine is \"Functional Medicine\". You will find MD's, chiropractors, physical therapists etc. all using the buzzwords. Well, Naturopathic Medicine is THE original Functional Medicine! Our goal has always been to search for the disruptor of normal function in order to design a plan to restore proper function, thus restoring health. Things to Know When Choosing a Naturopathic Doctor Dr. Urban is a Naturopathic Doctor who graduated from the National University of Natural Medicine in Portland Oregon. She is 1 of only 20 or so of credentialed ND's in the state of Wisconsin. Typically, each Doctor earns a 4 year college degree before going on to medical school for an additional 5 to 6 years. They pursue a rigorous scientific curriculum that includes all of the classes taught at a traditional medical school. Additionally, they undertake a comprehensive curriculum in natural medicine. They must pass national board exams in both traditional and natural medicine. They are the only profession with this dual training. These doctors hold licenses in other states and all regularly pursue continued professional development to provide their patients with excellent care. Did you know that in Wisconsin, anyone can call themselves a naturopathic doctor, or ND? This is because the state of Wisconsin does not have a practice act for this profession. This can be confusing and misleading to the patient, as there are people calling themselves \"Doctor\" without having legitimate credentials nor having an education from an institution that is recognized by the Department of Education. (Many of the online schools have created their own \"accreditation board\" to certify their own students to appear legitimate) This means a person who may not have even finished high school can take a 30 hour class online and actually call themselves an ND. Nationally, 20 states recognize and regulate the profession. The Wisconsin Association of Naturopathic Physicians is advocating for this regulation in our state. "}
