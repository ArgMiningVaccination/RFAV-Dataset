The leaves are simple, opposite, shortly petiolate or sessil e, broadly lanceolate or spatulate to almost linear, 0.6 -5 cm long, and 0.3 -1 cm wide. They are attenuated at the base, and the apex is acute blunt, with entire, glabrous or pilose (thin, fine, articulate hairs) margins. The inflorescences are dense, sessi le, silvery -white clusters of compressed spikes in the leaf axils; perianth segments are equal in length, acute, 1.5 -2.5 mm long with a short point. Bracts are ovate, concave, 0.3 -1 mm long and persistent; bracteoles are oblong -ovate, 1 -1.5 mm long, may be acute, and not deeply lacerated. Sepals are 2 -3 mm long, white or purplish, glossy with a green base, glabrous or with a few long hairs, and a strong midrib. The fruits are indehiscent, a small, flattened, obcordate or obovate utricle, 2 -2.5 mm long, enclosing the seed. Seeds are dark -brown to black, disc-shaped and shiny, about 0.8 -1 mm in diameter. They are light sensitive .[1] A decoction is recommended as an herbal remedy to treat wounds, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, cough, bronchitis, diarrhea, curati ve, protective or promote purposes. Its root can relieve inflamed wounds. A. sessilis is used as a local medicine often in mixtures with other medicinal plants, to treat hepatitis, tight chest, bronchitis, asthma and other lung troubles. The leaves and sho ots boiled and drunk as an antihypertensive remedy. [11] DISTRIBUTION In Noakhali district of Bangladesh, the plant is used to treat gonorrhea, low sperm count and leucorrhea. In several areas of Faridapur and Rajbari districts of Bangladesh, the plants ar e used by folk medicinal practitioners fpr treatment of severe pain. The tribals of Bargarh district, India use the plant to treat blood dysentery. Different communities of Uttra Khannada district of Karnataka, India use the plant to treat ulcers, cuts and wounds. The Irula tribals of Kalavai, Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India, sterol; it also contains 24 -methylenecycloartanol and cycloeucalenol. Saponins have been isolated from the leaves. Roots contain lupeol. Young shoots contain protein and iron . It also contains 5 -a -stigmasta -7- enol.[10] O ANTIHYPERGLYCIMIC ACTIVITY: Plant material collection: Aerial parts (leaves and stems) of A.sessilis were collected. Preparation of methanolic extract of aerial parts: Aerial parts were cut into small pieces, air -dried in the shade, and 1 00 g of dried and powdered leaves and stems was extracted with methanol (w:v ratio of 1:6, final weight of the extract 8.03 g). Chemicals and drugs: Glibenclamide, aspirin, and glucose Animals: Swiss albino mice (male) Oral glucose tolerance tests for eva luation of antihyperglycemic activity IAJPS 2017, 2349 -7750 w w . i a j p s . c o m Page 2847 The fastened mice were grouped into six groups of 5 mice each. Group 1: Received vehicle Group 2: Received standard drug Group 3 -6: Received extract (MEAAS) at doses of 50,100,200 and 400 mg per kg body weight. Following a period of one hour, all mice were orally administered 2 g glucose/kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected 120 minutes after the glucose administration through puncturing heart. Blood glucose levels were measured by glucose oxidase method. The percent lowering of blood glucose levels were calculated according to the formula described below. Percent lowering of blood glucose level= (1-We/Wc)\u00d7100, Where We and Wc represent the bloog glucose concentration in glibenclamide or MEAAS administered mice (Group 2 -6), and control mice (Group 1) respectively. Antihyperglycemic activity evaluation results Administration of MEAAS at doses of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg per kg body weight, the concentration of blood glucose in glucose -loaded mice was reduced significantly by 22.9, 30.7, 45.4 and 46.1% respectively. By comparision, a standard antihyperglycemic drug, glibernclamide, when administered to mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight, reduced blood glucose level by 48.9%. [2] Table 1: Effect of crude methanol extract [2] 1. ANTIDIARRHOEAL Material and Methods Collection and identification of Plant material: Fresh plant material of Alternanthera sessilis were collected during the month of May and June Extraction and Preparation of the Extract: After collection, the plant materials were air dried for one week. This was further subjected to another one week of drying in an oven maintained at 400C. The leaves were pulverized into a smooth powder. The pulverized plant material was mixed with distilled water and left for 72 hours. The mixture was stirred at 6 hours intervals using a sterile glass rod. At the end, the extract was passed through filter paper. The filtrates were concentrated with the aid of a vacuum pump and rotavapour at 400 C. The concen trated extract was refrigerated prior to use. Animals: Albino Swiss mice The experiment was performed by inducing diarrhoea using castor oil. Table: 2 Results and Discussion The results indicate that the aqueous extract of Althernantha sessilis poss esses significant antidiarrhoeal activity due to its effect on gastrointestinal propulsion and fluid secretion.[3] 2. ANTIMICROBIAL AND ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY Plant Material: Fresh plants of Alternanthera sessilis were collected and washed thoro ughly 4 -5 times with running tap water and then finally with sterile water and dried in shade at room temperature for 20 -25 days. The dried plant material was made into coarse powder and sieved, and then used for crude extraction. Solvents like water, etha nol, methanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, chloroform and petroleum ether were used for extraction. Extraction: 20 gm powder of each plant were soaked separately in 200ml water, ethanol, methanol acetone, ethyl acetate, chloroform, petroleum ether in conica l flask and kept in shaker for 24 hours. After the extract was filtered and collected into glass vials. The process was repeated for 3 times with same material but using fresh solvents. The extracts were collected and concentrated at 40\u00b0C under reduced pre ssure using rotary evaporator. The extract was stored at 4\u00b0C until further use. Test organisms: Bacillus pumillus, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, 2349 -7750 w w . i a j p s . c o m Page 2848 Antimicrobial activity assessment: The aqueous extracts of Alternanthera sessilis evaluated for antibacterial activity and antifungal activity using agar well diffusion method. Antibacterial activity of Althernanthera sessilis sessilis showed good antiba cterial activity against gram positive and gram negative organisms. It suggests the usefulness of the plants against antimicrobial activity. So it is anticipated that Alternanthera would be useful to treat diseases. This investigation may lead to the devel opment of natural antimicrobial agents.[ 4] 1. NUTRITIVE and preparation of sample Leaves of Alternanthera sessilis were harvested. The leaves were washed and dried to avoid destroying active compounds. Dried leaves were ground to homo genous powder using willwy mill grinder and stored in air tight container. Sample was subjected to biochemical analysis. Biochemical Analysis Biochemical analysis were carried out to find total Carbohydrate, Starch, Protein, Aminoacid, Vitamin B1 and Vita min B2 according to the procedure of Association of Official Analytical Chemist (Sadasivam and Manickam, 1992. The cooking quality was analyzed for total Carbohydrate, Starch and Proteins Results and Discussion The biochemical composition of Alternanthera sessilis leaves based on cooking time interval of 0 min, 5min, 10min and 15min (Table 2 and Chart 1) revealed that there was a gradual decrease in the composition of Carbohydrate and Starch. The composition of proteins remained approximately the same. Henc e Alternanthera sessilis leaves can be recommended to be co oked in an average of 5 -10 min.

Colour change from yellow to reddish brown indicated silver nanoparticles formation. These were then purified by repetitive centrifugation for 10 min at 7000 rpm. Finally the pellets were collected and dried. The chemical tests were carried out in ASNPs for vitamin C and proteins. UV spectrum analysis : Silver ions reduction was confirmed by measuring UV spectrum of reaction mixture. Distilled water was used as blank. The UV analy sis was done by double beam spectrophotometer, Shimadzu 1800, at resolution 1 nm from 250 to 450 nm. SEM analysis : FE -SEM (JEOL JSM 3600) was used to do the Morphological characterization of the samples. A small amount of dried sample was coated on the ca rbon tape. It was again coated with platinum then the material was subjected to analysis. RESULTS: UV-vis Spectra Analysis: Extracts from whole plants under study showed rapid conversion of silver nitrate into silver nanoparticles indicated by colour chan ge within few minutes of addition of extract in 3mM AgNO3 solution, from pale yellow to red -brown. The spectrum showed a maximum absorption in range between 420 - 450 nm.[6] Figure: 5 Figure:6 Scanning electron microscopy: The study of characterizatio n of ASNPs, revealed sperical shape of nanoparticles. 1. ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTY USING YEAST MODEL SYSTEM Materials and methods: Yeast sample collection: Yeast sample was collected from sugar factory effluent. Sample was collected in sterile plastic bottel es and brought to laboratory. Plant collection: Fresh leaves of A.sessilis leaves were used to eastimate all parameters. They were washed free of contaminations under running tap water and blotted dry between the folds of soft tissue paper. Extract prepa ration: The leaves were washed free of surface contamination with tap water, rinsed with distilled water and blotted gently with filter paper. 1g of fresh leave was homogenized and the residues were percolated the different solvents (Methanol, Ethanol and Water) in 5ml. The homogenates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant was used. Isolation of the Yeast: The sample was serially diluted using sterile saline. The sample was mixed thoroughly and streaked on the YPD agar plates the n incubated at 37\u00b0C in an incubator in inverted position. IAJPS 2017, 4 2349 -7750 w w . i a j p s . c o m Page 2850 Duplicates were maintained for 2 days incubation and the plates were examined for colonies formation. A single colony from a plate was picked out and it was sub cultured in YPD broth and it was used for further studies. Genomic DNA of the yeast cell was isolated and visualized and photographed using an Alpha Digidoc digital gel documentation system. Rapid Screening of Antioxidant Activity Dot Plot Assay: Aliquots (3\u00b5l) of A. sessilis extracts were spotted on a TLC plate and allowed to dry. The TLC plate bearing the dry spots was placed upside down for 10 seconds in the solution of DPPH. The spots exhibiting radical scavenging, antioxidant activity showed up as yellow spots in a violet backgrou nd. The intensity of the yellow colour depends on the amount and nature of the radical scavenger present in the spot. DPPH Photometric Assay : An exact amount(0.5ml) of the methanol solution of DPPH was added with 20 \u00b5l of the leaf extracts in the differe nt solvents and the crude aqueous extract (corresponding to 4mg) and 0.48ml of methanol and allowed to standard room temperature for 30 minutes. Methanol served as the blank. After 30 minutes, the absorbance was measured at 518nm and converted into percent age radical scavenging activity as follows: Scavenging activity (%) = RESULTS Rapid Screening of Antioxidant Activity Dot Plot Assay: A. sessilis leaf extract showed the DPPH scavenging activity in aqueous extract, followed by ethan ol and methanol extract.
