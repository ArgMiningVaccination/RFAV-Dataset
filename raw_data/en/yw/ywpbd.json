Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - 4/22/2023 I've been seeing Dr. Minna Yoon for years now for bio identical hormone treatment /balancing my hormones, feeling great and truly experiencing the fountain of youth. My skin, vitality and over all well being and health are vibrant and no one can believe I'm in my mid-sixties! - 6/27/2023 You'll pay a lot, and get a lot of nothing. I'll be moving on, lets leave it at that. The work we attempted has stalled out, it's in limbo? Who knows ... actually I do, I'm cutting my losses. - 2/8/2022 I worked with Dr. Yoon for a period of time and can relate to some of the negative reviews here in terms of: *Negligence--Not knowing when to refer out; now knowing what she doesn't know; not knowing when something is out of her scope; not having the knowledge/training of a primary care physician but making potentially dangerous treatment decisions without adequate monitoring and follow-up. I also noticed that she didn't seem to place much emphasis on getting an accurate diagnosis and instead took a chaotic \"D-Day\" approach to my mystery symptoms, randomly trying different treatments but with no clear plan if the treatments failed. When they failed, instead of referring me out, she hinted that my stress was the reason why the symptoms weren't going away (i.e., it's my fault) and became less invested in helping me get the proper care I needed, even if it meant referring me out (which she absolutely should have done). I put way too much stock in her and thought she knew best, and she didn't. *Attitude--In the beginning, she was very kind and cordial and then became more \"burnt out\" and abrupt with me over time. When she wasn't able to effectively diagnose and treat a major health condition, she essentially gave up on me and I had to do most of the legwork in the patient-doctor relationship, suggesting possible diagnoses and treatments. Her attitude toward me became dismissive and almost lazy. She also dismissed some other symptoms I was having (\"you don't fit the body type for that diagnosis\") that wound up being officially diagnosed by another healthcare professional. Toward the end of my \"relationship\" with Dr. Yoon, she stopped responding to my emails and gave off a careless attitude that honestly shocked me and is the kind of thing that would be reportable for most healthcare practitioners. (And no, I wasn't going overboard with emailing; I was very respectful.) Bottom line: While I respect integrative approaches, I learned the hard way that a naturopath is in no way a replacement for a primary care physician, and a practitioner such as Dr. Yoon who demonstrates such negligence can have dire consequences on your health (it did for mine, no exaggeration--I'm only getting proper care now with an MD for a serious autoimmune issue that Dr. Yoon overlooked and misdiagnosed). If you do want to see an integrative practitioner, either see an integrative MD or see a naturopath who is way more buttoned-up and professional in their approach as an adjunct and have them collaborate with your MD. - 8/25/2019 Thank you, Dr. Yoon for your attentive care. Every visit reenforces my opinion of how your skills and interactions bring relief to your patient's problems. - 8/5/2013 I would not recommend Minna and seriously question her ethics,honesty and practice. .I initially saw her for acupuncture for neck pain having found her through my insurance.She failed to tell me about her out of pocket fee for \"initial evaluation\"She insisted on an extensive blood panel which was an additional exhorbitant fee from a lab in which she has an\" interest\" .She then wanted to charge me an additional fee to simply go over the results at which point I drew the line and left...She also prescribed estrogen and progesterone after I told her about my recent dx and tx for breast cancer.The only pharmacy she recommended was one in which she has a \" interest\". If I would have known upfront about her tactics which I consider to be underhanded and dishonest I would never have followed through with an appointment. - 12/18/2016 I was a patient of Dr. Yoon's for several years while I lived in the Bay Area, and recommend her highly. She is a knowledgable naturopath with extensive training in multiple healing modalities. She listens actively and is a compassionate care giver. In my experience, she has always been up-front about her fees and the costs of various treatments, as well as explaining clearly why she recommends a particular course of treatment. I learned a lot while under Dr. Yoon's care. - 12/12/2009Updated review Ah, the serenity and focus has helped me to work on some personal physical issues are brought out by the work of Minna Yoon. She has a wonderful office and personable approach in which she listens in her evaluation of your needs that is very thorough. It's made my health all the richer. I only wish I can have the cups work on my shoulder every day. One need not be afraid of needles with Minna as your acupuncturist. I highly recommend her.8/1/2009Previous review I've gone to Minna for sometime now for help on my shoulder. She's been most helpful and through in her analysis. I recommend that you give cups a try. Love it. - 11/2/2009 Dr Minna Yoon is great and is very consistent in her healing methods. I came in for a Herniated Disc on my L5-S1 and had trouble functioning in my every day life due to pain. After my initial visit the pain level went from an 8 to 2. She is conveniently located off the N-Judah around 12th st and takes insurance. She is personable, patient and very caring which is important when providing health or healing services. I had to discontinue my visits because of my long term trip to LA but i definitely plan on making future visits when I come back from disability. - 7/26/2017 Dr. Yoon has been a strong influence on my life this past year. I sought her guidance for acne and melasma. Her deep knowledge coupled with insightful analysis helped me to approach my skin in ways that I've not been able to get from other medical practitioners. She has been patient and resourceful when I've seen setbacks. I highly recommend Dr. Yoon, especially for those who feel that they have hit a dead end with traditional, western medicine. - 11/1/2013 I saw Dr. Yoon a few years back and she was a part of my health journey, for which I am thankful. She's quite pleasant and really does get to know your life's picture as part of her practice and all the blood panels, plus hormone tests really helped me to see for myself the greater context that was playing a part in my health problems. However, for a few reasons I can't recommend her very high. One reason is that despite the added context, she wasn't able to diagnose something I suggested early on (hereditary hemochromatosis) which was diagnosed over a year later by a specialist that my roommate (who was a doctor) steered me towards (ie, she didn't do her job as a primary care doctor and send me to a specialist). Not only that, but when she finally came around to the idea that my suggestion was correct, she seemed confused, hadn't done her homework and shared her concern that she unsure of that diagnosis because I wasn't of an Inuit descent...when I did my own research, this particular genetic issue was of Irish genetics - and indeed runs quite high currently in Ireland where they screen for this inherited disease (that causes a lifetime of low quality life, various inflammations and eventually death). Aside from that, when it came to some of the hormonal issues I was having regarding progesterone, she tried one way of treating me for it and then gave up...I've since seen another doctor who is trying another way (successfully so far) and giving me better context into how LOW (not high) cortisol plays into my issues, along with various kinds of stress (like the high intensity exercise I favor over gym workouts). In the end, I felt she just gave up on me and several times told me flat out to 'Quit your job' which I argue, would cause just as much if not more stress. I have waited nearly two years to write this review as I feel sincerely bad to say anything bad about anybody. But seeing a few of the other reviews, I wanted to let people know mine too and hopefully give a balanced view of Dr. Yoon's services. I have to say I'm quite happy now with my two doctors (a holistic allopathic doctor and a naturopathic doctor). I've lost 20 pounds of weight, have improved my hormones, on a proper diet and cross fingers will keep going with this track. I'm really sorry that Dr. Yoon didn't work out, I really wanted to support my neighborhood community and hope she finds it in herself to improve her approach or limit her services to what she does well. Hope this review helps someone make a better decision about health care.
