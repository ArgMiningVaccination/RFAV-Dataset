Dr. Ernst in Arlington, WA is a chiropractor who has helped many people improve their health. Call our clinic today at (360) 659-8464 to see how we can help you. Most people understand that chiropractic adjustments are a successful way to relieve a variety of pain conditions, but a growing body of data indicates it can also enhance our immune system. In our office Arlington, WA, we help patients with both musculoskeletal problems and general wellness. Earlier studies have indicated that spinal adjustments can affect specific immune responses in both healthy participants and back pain patients. However there have been no major literature reviews of the overall effect of chiropractic care on immunity. In a recent presentation at the 9th Chiropractic, Osteopathy, and Physiotherapy Annual Conference in the UK, Jack Neil of the Anglo-European College of Chiropractic analyzed the current research on spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and immune responses. After examining the research up to January 2012, Neil found that spinal adjustments are associated with a central anti-inflammatory response. Research shows that SMT may lead to a down regulating of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in antibodies involved in the immune response. Furthermore, SMT may enhance the creation of tiny cells called leukocytes which support the white blood cells in fighting off a threat. SMT may also affect Natural Killer cells, interleukin-2 activity, TNF-a levels, cortisol, and b-endorphin levels. The mechanics behind these processes are still vague, however. There is not sufficient research yet to be sure whether these inflammatory improvements correlate with an improvement in symptoms. \"Most research to date has focused on asymptomatic patients with short-term improvements. The challenge now is to clinically observe long-term health benefits in symptomatic patients,\" Neil concluded. Although more investigation is required, current evidence indicates that chiropractic adjustments can result in positive changes in the immune system. These immunological changes may show us why chiropractic can lessen inflammation and pain while boosting general wellness. We have worked with many patients in Arlington, WA improve their health.
