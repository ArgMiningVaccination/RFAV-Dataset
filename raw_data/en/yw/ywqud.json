Created by the Omnibus Crime Control andSafe Streets Act of 1968, as amended, NIJ is authorized to support research, evaluation, anddemonstration programs, development of technology, and both national and internationalinformation dissemination. Specific mandates of the Act direct NIJ to: uSponsor special projects, and research and development programs, that will improve andstrengthen the criminal justice system and reduce or prevent crime. uConduct national demonstration projects that employ innovative or promising approaches forimproving criminal justice. uDevelop new technologies to fight crime and improve criminal justice. uEvaluate the effectiveness of criminal justice programs and identify programs that promise to besuccessful if continued or repeated. uRecommend actions that can be taken by Federal, State, and local governments as well as byprivate organizations to improve criminal justice. uCarry out research on criminal behavior. uDevelop new methods of crime prevention and reduction of crime and delinquency. In recent years, NIJ has greatly expanded its initiatives, the result of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (the Crime Act), partnerships with other Federal agencies andprivate foundations, advances in technology, and a new international focus. Some examples ofthese new initiatives: uNew research and evaluation is exploring key issues in community policing, violence againstwomen, sentencing reforms, and specialized courts such as drug courts. uDual-use technologies are being developed to support national defense and local law enforcement needs. uSix regional National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Centers and a BorderResearch and Technology Center have joined the National Center in Rockville, Maryland. uThe causes, treatment, and prevention of violence against women and violence within thefamily are being investigated in cooperation with several agencies of the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services. uNIJ's links with the international community are being strengthened through membership in theUnited Nations network of criminological institutes; participation in developing the U.N.Criminal Justice Information Network; initiation of UNOJUST (U.N. Online Justice Clearing-house), which electronically links the institutes to the U.N. network; and establishment of anNIJ International Center. uThe NIJ-administered criminal justice information clearinghouse, the world's largest, hasimproved its online capability. uThe Institute's Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program has been expanded and enhanced.

NCJ 166609iiiForeword Foreword In organizing the lecture series recorded in this volume, Jeremy Travis, Director of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), pulled together a \"dream team\" of speakers.They cover a rich diversity of disciplinary perspectives andspan a broad range of personal ideologies; in addition, eachpossesses an excellent research record and the ability to linkresearch to policy implications. James Q. Wilson, a political scientist and the leadoff speaker, has probably been the most influential voice on crime policyfrom academia in recent decades. His 1975 classic, Thinking about Crime, effectively articulated the deterrence argument and challenged many of the prevailing liberal views. And hisbook with Richard Herrnstein, Crime and Human Nature, broadly probed many of the biological and developmentalfactors associated with individual criminality. Norval Morris, a leading scholar in criminal law, has been a dominant contributor on the other side of the ideologicalspectrum. His very influential An Honest Politician's Guide to Crime Control was an early attempt to counter the rapidly growing \"get tough\" sound-bite epidemic that has so domi-nated public discussion of crime control policy. His Future of Imprisonment reported on a classic experiment in randomized assignment to treatment programs. As the longtime leader ofthe Center for Studies in Crime and Justice at the Universityof Chicago Law School, Norval Morris has also been thementor to an important group of scholars in crime andcriminal justice, including James Jacobs, Michael Tonry, andFranklin Zimring.ivForeword These two more senior scholars have been joined by excellent contributors one short generation behind. Peter Reuter is an economist who has been a leadingscholar of drug markets and their interaction with drug-war enforcement. CathySpatz Widom is a psychologist who has become widely recognized for her work onthe cycles of violence, showing that people who experience violence as childrenare more likely to engage in violence as adults. Mark Moore is a policy analyst whohas done important research on many aspects of crime and the criminal justicesystem, and he has been a most influential teacher of managers in policing,prosecution, and other areas of criminal justice through innovative managementseminars at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Even with authors so diverse in their perspectives and interests, some important common themes emerge from their lectures. Perhaps the most important is thedifficulty of addressing the \"what works\" question. The difficulties are manifold:some derive from the extremely limited level of funding available, some from thetechnical difficulty of carrying out careful testing in an operational environment,and some from a generalized suspicion about social science research. But greaterflexibility in research budgets seems to be emerging in recent years. This has beenaided by the allocation of funds to NIJ from the various Crime Act programs toperform research and evaluation studies. Another important common theme is the continuing need for evaluation of various kinds of intervention programs. One can hardly argue against such evalua-tions; it is critical that we learn which efforts are most effective and which arefutile. One problem that has plagued evaluations in the past has been the preva-lence of \"null effect\" findings, i.e., results showing that the intervention beingevaluated does no better than a control or the status quo. Too often, this happensbecause the intervention being tested is too narrow a \"technology,\" i.e., a strictlydefined approach that is presumed to be broadly applicable. Given this narrownessof approach, the diversity of individuals being dealt with, and the varying skills ofthose implementing the intervention, it is not surprising that most technologieswould fail to produce resonance among all three. It is thus important to recognizevForeword that any treatment of phenomena as complex as criminal behavior must involve a portfolio of interventions, one or more of which is applied\u2014perhaps at differenttimes\u2014according to the individual circumstances, and followup with the individu-als being treated. Only with this array of interventions and their extended durationcan we expect to bring about the changes needed for effective management ofcrime-prone situations and individuals. We still need greater readiness to carry out the same kind of probing evaluations of programs that have political support as we do with programs that raise moreskepticism. For example, I would be prepared to bet on the incremental crime-control benefit per dollar of cost associated with providing greater support servicesto high-risk young people\u2014as Cathy Spatz Widom argues for\u2014compared toextending already long sentences. It would be desirable to provide those supportservices broadly, especially to avoid any stigmatizing effects. But there will inevita-bly have to be a triage of focusing the limited resources available where they cando the most good. We all recognize that such choices are extremely difficult in sopolitical an arena as that surrounding crime and criminal justice. The bet is especially secure when an extension of sentence occurs through sledge- hammer approaches like mandatory-minimum or \"three strikes\" sentencing lawsthat put very disparate cases into the same legislated box and preclude the exerciseof judicial discretion that is needed to differentiate the most serious cases fromthose that are marginal. These gross approaches have been most evident in the \"drug war.\" About one- quarter of the Nation's incarcerated population\u2014and about two-thirds of those inFederal prisons \u2014are imprisoned on a drug sales or possession charge. This is a consequence of the incessant pursuit of the supply side of the drug market, eventhough students of the subject as well as practitioners in the field widely acknowl-edge that it is demand that drives the market: suppliers somehow find a way torespond to the demand. As Peter Reuter points out, many thought that theescalation of incarceration for drug offending over the past 15 to 20 years wouldviForeword raise the price of the drugs to compensate sellers for the greater risk implied. But we have seen just the opposite trend: the marketplace has been swamped withcheaper, higher quality drugs. Ironically, the increase in availability has beenaccompanied by a decrease in the demand for cocaine, the most serious drug interms of violence associated with its use and with its markets. Other factors in thesociety have been at work in a much more powerful way. Driven strongly by the drug war, intervention by the criminal justice system has been considerable. By 1996, the incarceration rate reported by the Bureauof Justice Statistics had surged to 440 per 100,000 population\u2014quadruple therate that had prevailed for the 50 years from the early 1920s to the early 1970s.The Sentencing Project has estimated that one-third of African-American malesin their twenties are today under the control of the criminal justice system; therate is even higher in urban centers. Mark Moore raises the question of whetherwe have come to overrely on the criminal justice system for addressing too manyof our society's problems. Such a greatly broadened scope of intervention maydiminish the impact of deterrence\u2014arguably the system's greatest leveragingpoint. It is difficult to use the threat of conviction or even incarceration as astigmatizing menace when it is happening to so many in the neighborhood. Another major thrust of the lectures was the problems of juveniles, especially minority juveniles trapped in urban ghettos and deprived of many of the influencesthat would facilitate their entry into the legitimate economy. This was particularlyemphasized by James Q. Wilson, who pointed to the growth in juvenile violence,much of it attributed to the recruitment of predominantly minority kids into thedrug markets\u2014and thus, into the world of handgun violence\u2014both of whichdramatically raised their homicide rates as victims and offenders. The problems these kids pose to the larger society will undoubtedly be exacerbated by welfare reform as their mothers scramble to replace welfare checks with jobs thatwill diminish their child-care time and attention\u2014or with criminal activity if theycan't find jobs. This calls attention to a point raised by a number of the authors aboutviiForeword the need to be concerned with the unintended consequences of what we do. The intensity of political rhetoric driving crime policy makes it all the more importantthat research feed information on unintended consequences into the debate. I would also like to extend Norval Morris's reference to \"the most corrupting lie is the truth poorly told.\" While his comment focused on the presentation of overlysimplified information by the press, I think his point is applicable to almost everyonewho comments on issues of crime or criminal justice. The phenomena are so multi-faceted\u2014in terms of type of crime, demographic group, and geographical location\u2014that aggregate statements miss many of the important distinctions. Disaggregationon these various dimensions is critical to assess meaningful conclusions. Indeed, one can anticipate that the same broad and disaggregated perspective is needed in pursuing a program of research on crime. One needs a rich mixture ofdisciplines and continual challenge to any intermediate findings, which mustalways be seen as potentially refuted or, more likely, modified in terms of the scopeof coverage of any particular finding. This process may seem to be expensive, but itis far less expensive than the cost of the wasted effort spent on ineffective programsand is necessary in order to develop the solid body of knowledge and techniquethat will enable us to get beyond Wilson's enumeration of dubious findings. NIJ has made an important contribution by bringing speakers of such quality and diversity to Washington. These scholars clearly felt free to challenge existingpolicy and to raise questions that should be addressed. NIJ's research program andthe public policy debate are very much helped thereby. It is encouraging that thisprocess will continue in a new series of lectures in the coming year. Alfred Blumstein, Ph.D. J.

Crime dominates evening news broadcasts, demandslarge shares of governmental budgets, influences ourdecisions about where to live, and plays a role in ourchoices on election day. Crime also inflicts enormouslosses on youths, families, and the Nation's sense ofsecurity. Yet there is no consensus about what we should do to meet the challenge of crime and the demand for justice. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) has initiated this lecture series to broaden the reach of research conductedunder its sponsorship and contribute to the nationaldebate on criminal justice policy. This volume presents the first of NIJ's Perspectives on Crime and Justice Lecture Series\u2014for 1996-1997. Someof the most distinguished academics in our field wereinvited to offer their thoughts on the topic of theirchoice. They were expected to challenge conventionalthinking, offer candid recommendations, and lead arobust debate. They did not disappoint. On behalf of NIJ, I wish to express my appreciation to the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation for its support of thelecture series. Their funding provided the planning andcoordination assistance needed to implement each lecture.xIntroduction We are pleased to announce that the Perspectives on Crime and Justice Lecture Series will continue; the 1997-1998 series will begin in December1997. NIJ has asked other scholars to examine new issues through the lens ofpublic policy as a way to bring the results and implications of current researchto the attention of decisionmakers at the local, State, and national levels.

Presentation by James Q. Wilson, Ph.D. University of California at Los Angeles December 10, 1996 Washington, D.C. Politically, Washington must pretend it can do a lot about crime. Practically, it can do very little. The President is not a police chief, a warden, or a probationofficer, and he can issue few commands to anyone who is.The size of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) hasgrown, but it is, at best, only one-fortieth the size of local lawenforcement in the country. By contrast, the Home Office inEngland has a great deal of influence over policing because itprovides half or more of the budgets of local constables. Here,of course, Congress also spends money on crime, but theFederal Government outlay is but a small fraction of whatlocal governments, communities, States, and private agenciesspend. We sometimes think that however small the Federalproportion is, it can influence the rest of the system. But inmy view\u2014and the view of many others\u2014this small tail willnot wag this very large dog. Ideas and local political pressuresdrive local law enforcement in this country. The role of the2What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? Federal Government is, at best, to try to shape the direction in which those movements occur. The vast majority of all offenders are tried before State-appointed judges, sent to State-run prisons, and released into the custody ofState-directed parole officers. The gap between what is possible and what is politically desirable has not prevented Washington from trying to do a lot. It has made over 3,000 offensesinto Federal crimes, even though most of the important offenses have beenState crimes for decades. The slow movement toward the Federalization of lawenforcement is worrisome to many Americans for reasons I fully share. If wehave 3,000 Federal criminal charges and if this is more than purely symbolicpolitics, then a Federal officer must investigate their violation. Federal investigations play a very important part with respect to some matters. But for the most part, having this many Federal crimes means that we ought tohave a Federal\u2014that is, a thoroughly national\u2014police force. No one devotedto our Constitution could embrace such a prospect cheerfully, and I do not.Even creating the FBI many decades ago\u2014an organization which soon becamea small elite unit\u2014was greeted with skepticism when it first occurred. Thepassage of the Mann Act in 1910 was a profoundly contentious issue becauseit, for the first time, set up a Federal criminal standard. It deeply dividedCongress. On what grounds, people argued, should prostitution become aFederal crime? The answer given, of course, was that it could become one ifprostitution affected interstate commerce. And so was created an odd Federaltask\u2014assigning a few FBI agents, mostly rookies, to the task of trying to followsuspected prostitutes across State lines. In short order, the Federal courts,including the Supreme Court, began to brood over the vague language embod-ied by Congress in this statute\u2014words like \"debauchery\" or \"other immoralpurposes\"\u2014that are undefined. The courts began to expand the Mann Act soit would now be a Federal offense for a woman voluntarily to cross a State lineto have sex whether paid or not, or to move to a location where debaucherymight occur, or to accompany a vacationing Mormon family who happened to3James Q. Wilson be polygamous.1 When a State court gets carried away in this respect, one can do something about it\u2014if only by moving to a different a State. When Wash-ington does it, the only alternative is Canada. Federal criminal laws now imply the creation of a Federal police force. No one wants to do it, of course, but we have a way of drifting into situations that noone intends. Even if we hold back from a drift in that direction, the effort atfederally managing the crime problem cannot, so far as I can tell, help us solvemany of our real problems. Despite Federal involvement, crimes are gettingharder, not easier, to solve. Clearance rates are not going up, and many aregoing down. Most offenders commit crimes in or near their own back yards,creating local neighborhood, not national, problems. An increasing proportionof serious juvenile offenders are heavily armed and contemptuous of thejuvenile court system. Many neighborhoods have critical problems even incities that have modest or declining crime rates. An alternative to creating a Federal police force is to improve the strength of local ones. I think that is what the program to place 100,000 officers on ourcity streets has in mind. Though I am devoted to policing, and though I amconvinced that good cops well deployed make a difference, I am struck by theabsolute inability of Washington to send these officers to the places wherethey are needed. The problem is very simple. There are 435 congressionaldistricts and 50 States in this Union, and each and every one wants its share ofthe 100,000 officers. Half the officers, by law, must go to smaller cities. Our 14largest cities have only 12 percent of the Nation's population but account for36 percent of all homicides and nearly half of all robberies. These places coulduse all 100,000 officers by themselves. Yet, many of the officers go to smalltowns like Midvale, Texas. In Los Angeles during 1960, there were three violent crimes reported to the police for every uniformed officer. By 1990, there were 10 violent offenses forevery uniformed officer. Using this rough, admittedly simplistic measure, Los4What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? Angeles needs a police force of 25,000 today instead of the 8,000 or so it has. My city, in short, might be able to catch up with where it was 30 years ago if it hadone-sixth of the 100,000 new officers\u2014and if we could persuade our local constitu-ents to pay for their retention when the 6 federally funded years have expired. Naturally, Washington has an important duty to investigate real interstate crimes, both blue-collar and white-collar, all crimes involving interstateconspiracies, and all international crimes that touch our borders. And thereare Federal reservations and buildings it must guard. But it seems to me its keyrole ought to be to do the one thing local authorities cannot and will not doon their own. That is to design and test new crime-control strategies. Citiesand States will not do this, not simply because it costs money\u2014money thatthey, by and large, do not think they have\u2014but because they would be provid-ing a free good to other cities and States. Good demonstration projects areexpensive and take a lot of time. How does a mayor or Governor justifyspending that money and taking that time when one or the other of two badthings will happen: Either the new program won't work, thus embarrassing thecity or the State and the mayor or the Governor; or it will work, but thebenefits will go without charge to every other city and State in the country? The Federal Government has a unique opportunity to be the research and development (R&D) arm for law enforcement. It is a task that no city or Statewill undertake in any meaningful way, and it is also one that with a few excep-tions private foundations will not support. I have spent many years trying to raisemoney for this cause from private sources, including foundations for police andcriminal justice research. I have had, on occasion, some good allies, but generallyto no avail. Foundations support causes not evaluations, at least in this area. When I speak of a Federal R&D effort, I trust everyone here understands that I am not talking about pure or academic research. There is a need for that, too,but it often gets funded by Federal assistance through entities such as theNational Science Foundation, the National Academy of Sciences, and the5James Q. Wilson various National Institutes of Health. I am speaking of the real-world testing of new ideas, especially those developed by practitioners in the field\u2014ideas thatcannot, I am sorry to say, be tested by the practitioner who developed them.No good idea will be seriously evaluated by anyone who has a patent on it. Atest requires objectivity, technical skills, and a long time horizon. A practitio-ner is subjective (he or she must struggle to get the idea launched in an oftenhostile environment), is skilled at creating ideas but not necessarily at testingthem, and has a time horizon shaped by tomorrow's newspaper story or nextmonth's budget hearing, not by the 2 or 3 years that an adequate testing in thefield involves. Happily, there have long been a few people in Washington who have under- stood this view, such as James \"Chips\" Stewart in the Reagan administrationand Jeremy Travis in the Clinton administration. Of late, largely as a result ofthe 1994 Crime Act, the Department of Justice has said, I hope with congres-sional support, that it will spend a significant fraction of its new crime-controlmoney on demonstration projects. I would think it would be even better ifCongress, in reauthorizing this agency, placed in that reauthorization a man-date that set aside for research a fixed percentage of the money that Congresswould later appropriate for law enforcement. While I am committed to aFederal demonstration role, I am well aware of how hard it will be to getmeaningful results. People sometimes compare the low level of funding for crime or violence research with the high level of such funding for cancer, stroke, or AIDS. Thisdifference is very large\u2014indeed it is vast, but this is not simply the result ofunequal interest groups besieging Congress. Doctors, in fact, tend to do betterwork than criminologists. And for good reason: Doctors are more likely tolearn useful things that their own profession can put into practice than arecriminal justice researchers. There is both a demand problem\u2014what shouldthe Federal Government ask for?\u2014and a supply problem\u2014what are competentsocial scientists willing to produce?6What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? Health research may lead down many blind alleys, but treatments and even cures often emerge. And when they emerge, they enter into a well-organizedmarket of eager producers and consumers. Compare that record with thehistory\u2014a long and generally sad one\u2014of much criminal justice research.These are ideas that have had their brief place in the sun. I think we can allremember random preventive patrol? Claims made on behalf of \"scaredstraight?\" Remember the arguments used for boot camps? And shock incarcera-tion? And intensive probation? And remedial education? And job training andsupported work projects? And making police response time faster? To be sure,some of these things, done by a few gifted people, may have made a difference,but by and large, the research has failed to provide adequate support for theirgeneral applicability. We now are committed to a new wave of good ideas, of which community- oriented policing leads the list. I am a believer in it. I support it, but I have toconfess that my belief rests at present more on faith than on fact. We hear ofmany cities engaging in promising starts, and then retreats, cutbacks, andhostility. For every San Diego or New Haven where it seems to have been asuccess, we recall a Cincinnati or a Houston where it fell apart. For every patrolofficer who fell in love with community policing there is a lieutenant who thinksit is just the fad of the day. The famous 100,000 police officers to be paid for bythe Federal Government are supposed to support community policing, but that islike saying they are supposed to walk to Europe. A good idea, maybe, but we lacka clear road, and, in any event, 100,000 officers aren't enough to make a differ-ence even if they get there. Despite all of these reservations, I think the Federal R&D role is the right one. Go back to community policing for a moment. Why did it begin to commandour attention? It began to command our attention because the NationalInstitute of Justice (NIJ) supported a project in Newark, New Jersey, to test theefficacy of foot patrol. Most police chiefs at the time believed that foot patrolwould not have an effect on the crime rate. The NIJ study found out that they7James Q. Wilson were exactly right: It did not have an effect on the crime rate. It just made the people in Newark feel better. Out of the contrast between a crime rate thatwas stable and an improving public morale came an insight. How people feelabout their city may be as important as what the city in fact does. If people feelbetter about their city, they will be encouraged to use public spaces in wayswhich, in the long run, may actually drive down the crime rate but in themeantime allow them to enjoy what is in fact the right of every citizen: to walkpeacefully with some degree of comfort and confidence around the streets oftheir own cities. We have, after all, learned about a lot of things that don't work, and we wouldn't have done that if somebody had not been doing an evaluation. Weused to think that random preventive patrol deterred crimes and that quickpolice responses prevented crime. We now know those ideas are not correct.As a result, the police have been encouraged to look in new directions. Goodpolice around the country are using specialized preventive patrol, and under-cover operations, and they are dealing with police responses more by evokingfrom the community a definition of problems to be resolved rather thanwaiting for citizens to dial 911. To me, the critical issues are two: If you think as I do that R&D is the central role the Federal Government should play in this area\u2014nearly to the exclusionof many other things it now tries to do\u2014how should this work be financed anddirected? And, what should it study? I do not think this study should bedirected from the U.S. Department of Justice. There are many people in thisroom from the Department of Justice, but I don't think the work should bedirected from that agency. I admit that today we have an excellent NIJ direc-tor. There have been a few good ones before him, but counting on that con-tinuing is like expecting flowers to bloom through asphalt pavement. Occa-sionally it happens, but it is not the best way to grow a garden. DOJ is anorganization of lawyers, and lawyers do what lawyers are supposed to do: Theyinvestigate, sue, and prosecute. If anyone doubts the gap that exists between8What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? empirical science and legal research, he has never set foot on a university campus. I have served on the campuses of three great universities, and in eachand every case the gap between law school research and empirical socialsciences was a vast and unbridgeable divide. The best social scientists\u2014thereare a few good ones\u2014operate on campus in almost compete isolation from lawschools, and the best law professors\u2014and there are many of them\u2014return thecompliment. And if you think universities are an odd exception to a generalpattern of compatibility, you have not understood how most judges treatempirical science when it is introduced into their courtrooms. Scientificnonsense acquires evidentiary standing in ways that satisfy nobody but theappeals court judges who later rule on the matter. NIJ ought to be part of a federally supported larger whole, which is generally committed to scientific alliances and the maintenance of rigorous analysis. Ileave it to Washington insiders to select that spot, but I do not think theJustice Department is that spot. As to the second question: It is a very difficultproblem to prescribe in advance what the research agenda should be. There aremany important issues\u2014for example, can anyone show that communitypolicing, somehow defined, really works? Can anyone show that if it works itcan be made to continue to work? That research area will persist for years.There are other important technological areas that are being researched forthe first time in recent years. But one issue especially concerns me, and I would like to raise it to the top of the agenda if I can. That is the problem of juvenile criminals. Criminal justiceand social science know about adult offenders. Adult crime rates, includingadult homicide rates, seem to have declined in the 1980s, and we have tried tostudy why. But the rate at which juveniles commit crimes, especially homicide,went up, and we are not sure why. The rate of offenses is higher on the averagefor young people than it is for older people. Many people are being sent toprison\u2014for perfectly good reasons\u2014at a time when their own crime rate isbeginning to decline. In every society, the crime rate peaks in the teenageyears among males. We send the people to prison 10 years later.9James Q. Wilson This gap indicates that something is not working. We know that today juve- niles have become a smaller fraction of the whole population. We expectedthat their crime rate would go down as the adult rate generally went down, butit didn't. That has become for many years the most worrisome feature of localsociety. Most of what we know about the effects of punishment on offenders,whether in terms of deterring them or incapacitating them, we know onlyabout adults. We have interviewed them constantly. Our sense of adultbehavior has been elaborated by everything from general discussion to sophis-ticated quantitative models. We don't know anything of the sort about juve-niles. Some people think that juveniles are immune to the criminal justicesystem because they are so impulsive as to give no thought to the conse-quences of their actions and so reckless as not to care what society or the largercommunity thinks of them. Scholars have argued that imprisoning a juvenileonly makes matters worse because he becomes indoctrinated to gang activity ora criminal lifestyle. We actually know next to nothing about whether any of these arguments are true. We have interviewed adult prison inmates but not, to the same degree,juvenile ones. We can construct the criminal careers of thousands of adultoffenders but of far fewer juvenile ones. One of the very few efforts to find outwhat difference incarceration made on juvenile offenders was done in Chicagoin the 1970s. 2 The authors followed the careers of a few hundred serious delin- quents and found that the more serious the penalty imposed by the court system,the lower the rate of their subsequent offending. This finding was strikinglysimilar to that of two other studies done in the preceding decade, using verydifferent institutional treatments in quite different communities. 3,4 Questions can be raised about such findings: Why did their crime rate go down? Did theyjust get smarter? Did they evade police detection or adopt forms of crime thatwere harder to detect? As near as I can tell, in the intervening 20 years virtuallynothing has been done to try to answer these questions.10What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? We know that States and counties differ in how they handle juveniles, but we have almost no idea as to whether those differences in treatment make a differ-ence in crime rates. The chief of the Family Court Division of the New YorkCity Law Department has recently published a troubling and unhappy accountof how that city handles juveniles. 5 The family courts have faced an exploding caseload since the late 1980s, but the penalties imposed even on the mostvicious hoodlums rarely have exceeded 18 months. That is because New YorkState law limits penalties for persons under the age of 16 to 18 months. The lawgoverning investigations is even more restrictive. The police cannot ordinarilysearch a home occupied by a young offender without either a warrant or theparents' consent, but the family court cannot issue warrants. When a youngsterturns 16, a different set of rules apply. They can be tried as adults, but the courtscan, and often do, make these persons into \"youthful offenders,\" a status thatkeeps the potential sentence very low. Now contrast this with what the Los Angeles Times has reported about juvenile offenders in the State of California. The newspaper surveyed young inmates ofthe California Youth Authority and came to the conclusion that juvenileswere actually serving longer terms than adults sent to prison for similar of-fenses. Juveniles, for example, served 60 months in California for homicide,while adults served only 41 months. 6 Let us assume that New York and Califor- nia do in fact differ that dramatically. Does this difference make a difference? Will one system produce more or less crime than the other system? Are thepeople in either State safer or more at risk because of what appear to be greatdifferences in how these systems work? We do not know. As far as I know noone is trying to find out. As the population once again becomes younger\u2014theelementary schools of Los Angeles are filled to capacity with persons eagerlyawaiting the junior high school years in which the legendary 6 percent of themwill become hopeless offenders\u2014we know that crime rates are very likely to goup, and we ought to care.11James Q. Wilson There are many obstacles to doing research of this sort\u2014some are legal, some are technical. These obstacles are serious, but scholars have had to cope withserious matters in the past dealing with adult offenders. I believe that, withgood will and adequate support and direction, they can do the same withjuveniles. An equally important evaluative effort is needed for the causes of juvenile crime, which are not well understood. Criminological research has cited almost anydefect that a social scientist can find in American society as a cause for juvenilecrime. In all societies, juveniles commit more crimes than adults. And in allsocieties, as near as we can tell, the juvenile crime rate has been going up.Whatever the cause is, it may not be a uniquely American phenomenon. The new welfare reform bill has created a splendid opportunity to investigate what suspect is the most serious cause of juvenile crime, and that is the weak-ness in the family structure. The new welfare reform bill requires underage,single-parent mothers either to live with their own parents or under adequateadult supervision as a condition of receiving Federal aid. No one knows what\"adequate adult supervision\" means. It must be supposed to mean somethingother than supervision by her own parents. Often the young woman's predica-ment is the result of the failure of her parent or two parents to supervise heradequately. A wonderful opportunity exists for cities, counties, and States to provide a variety of new mechanisms as alternative \"families\" for such persons. Single-parent moms would have to live in alternative homes or shelters as a conditionof receiving aid. They and their newborn children would experience true adultsupervision from caring adults, who worry about the future of those children.Such efforts should be run by private organizations. Various church andsynagogue organizations could take on the task of supplying alternative homesif the Federal Government were willing to direct its welfare money in thatdirection. It would then be up to NIJ and other bodies to find out what works.12What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? Can we change things for the children of young unmarried teenage moms in such a way that we reduce the rate at which these young people grow up onthe mean streets of our cities with only guns as their friends? To me, the hardest task is not to create the agencies, encourage the practitioner links, or design the research. The core problem is to persuade members of Congressand their constituents that they are doing something about crime by spendingmoney on R&D evaluation. People believe they know what should be done aboutcrime, just as they believe they know what plays the Washington Redskins shouldcall. It is very hard to persuade them that, in fact, they don't know and ought tofind out. Maybe the only way to do it is to smuggle an evaluation program, writtenin very small type, into the next bill that increases the number of Federal offensesto 6,000, imposes the death penalty on 50 more crimes, closes the border to illegalimmigrants, and promises an end to wife abuse. Question-and-Answer Session Patrick Murphy, U.S. Conference of Mayors, Washington, D.C.: I certainly agree that we need to have much more research, and yet the problem is the\"non-system\" of policing we have\u201417,000-plus local police departments. Idescribe this to foreign police administrators, and they say, \"But of course theyare coordinated by your State police agencies.\" Federal police are coordinatedby the FBI, but that does not occur locally. We are all devoted to our system oflocal police, but it seems to me that the Federal Government and the Statescould do more, in addition to research, to coordinate the work of these agen-cies for criminal intelligence, support of planning, and better exchange ofknowledge. Would you comment on the system problem?13James Q. Wilson JQW: I certainly would encourage dissemination of intelligence, a real im- provement in suspect identification, and dissemination of information. But, Iam not encouraged among what I see abroad as \"systems.\" Since 1980, theadult crime rate has been dropping more or less systematically in all citiesacross the United States. During this same period, in countries that have aunified system like England and Sweden, for example, crime rates have beengoing up dramatically. Today, the robbery rate in England is as high as ours,and the auto theft rate is twice as high; in the Netherlands, the burglary rate istwice as high. The advantage of a unified system is that you get coordination.The disadvantage of the coordinated system is that you may coordinate itaround a bad idea. To me, the desirable consequence of the American system, messy as it is, is in what we have learned about how to improve the criminal justice system.Rogue police chiefs, backed up by brave or indifferent mayors, have tried newideas against the advice of other police officers and have made them work. Sowe have to try to strike a balance between a nonsystem and risk of bad actionif we have a full system. With the American genius for making something outof nothing in our Constitutional order, we can do that. I would resist, as amatter of principle, converting our nonsystem into anything that looks like aEuropean system. Questioner (not named): Professor Wilson, for the purposes of this question, place yourself on the Supreme Court. Last week you heard arguments on theBrady Act. How would you vote and why? JQW: As a Justice on the Supreme Court I would try to vote on the basis of what the statute requires and what the Constitution mandates. In Congress, Iwould have probably voted for the Brady Bill with little hope that it wouldmake a significant difference. Gun control is a serious matter that cannotadequately be handled by Washington policies directing the way in which14What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? guns are sold in federally licensed gun stores. The problem is to figure out ways to keep guns out of public places; they are usually stolen in the first place. With respect to the Supreme Court question and arguments and briefs, I haven't thought of it as a constitutional matter\u2014I have been too preoccupiedwith its limitations as a practical matter. I would prefer that you asked mewhat I would do in Congress rather than what I would do in the SupremeCourt. Roger Conner, American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, Wash- ington, D.C.: I was discouraged to hear intensive supervision probation in your list of things that, while useful, have not necessarily reduced or preventedcrime. As a way to address juvenile crime, what do you think of more intensiveand close supervision of probation to reduce reoffending in this group? JQW: I think that's a possibility. To me, one of the things that explains juvenile crime is that many youthful offenders lack any involvement with amature adult who might give a kind of guidance. What they most need is tohave a mature adult inserted into their lives on a continuing basis. One wayfor that to happen is to be born into a two-parent family that is reasonablysuccessful. Failing that, and we are increasingly failing that, perhaps we candesign and apply an ad hoc parent. I am open to the possibility of using intensive probation for first-time or early juvenile offenders; this may well avoid their repeated involvement in crime.The experiment in intensive supervision probation that I was referring to, asevaluated by the RAND Corporation, was focused on adults. At that stage, itdidn't seem to make much of a difference. A different story might be true if wefocused on early juvenile offenders, where there is some reason to expect toalter, by the presence of a mature adult in their lives, the prospects of theircontinued offending.15James Q. Wilson This is being tried in the country. Many things are being tried that I don't know about. I haven't seen an evaluation of it and I would very much like to. Samuel Dash, Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.: Professor Wilson, in your address you did not make any mention of the crimi-nal drug problem in the United States, its relationship to crime, and whetheryou think that the Federal Government plays a more effective law enforce-ment role than the local and State organizations. Since drug offenses arecovered under Federal law enforcement and the Federal Government claims agreater and greater role in this area, do you think Federal efforts are moreeffective, at least there, than local and State prosecution? JQW: I do think the Federal Government has a major role in drug enforce- ment. I had that in mind when I referred to interstate commerce and interna-tional trafficking. The Federal Government has become deeply involved in thedrug problem. I think that making better use of Federal resources to deal withthe drug problem is a critical need. Even so, the critical problem in drug abuseis the demand for drugs. Demand reduction is fundamentally a local matter.(Yes, I strenuously defend the illegality of drugs.) Who is using drugs? We know from many studies that a very high proportion of the people arrested have been using drugs in the preceding 72 hours, asrevealed by the customary drug tests. Most of these people will be placed onprobation or sentenced to confinement and after that possibly given parole.This is a readymade group of people, already under the authority of the crimi-nal justice system, who can be told that their permission to be on probation orparole is contingent upon their subjecting themselves to frequent (meaningseveral times a week) random drug testing, and that the failure to satisfy thesetests would bring them back into the criminal justice system for increasinglylonger periods of time. That is a local responsibility\u2014something that localpolice and probation authorities have to do. They are often financially16What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? underequipped to do it, although some promising starts have been made with respect to drug courts. Although I believe the Federal Government has a crucial role to play, and it is largely on the supply side, I think the key to the drug problem is on the demandside. If we can make it extremely difficult for those who are already in thecriminal justice system to gain access to drugs, I think demand will be reduced.People will, I hope, be driven into treatment programs, and the supply of drugswill fall correspondingly. Questioner (not named): Dr. Wilson, you mentioned the disparity between medical research and crime research. There is a perception in the medical andlegislative communities that the research on violent crime is being intimidatedor suppressed by certain groups. In your perception, is that the case? JQW: Yes, if you want to think about the research on violent crime generally, in all aspects, there is a substantial degree of suppression. If you wish to discussthe genetic bases behind crime\u2014which we know to a certainty exist, becausemales always commit 5 to 20 times as much violent crime as females (and not asa result of particular childrearing practices)\u2014mention this fact, especially in thiscity, and you will discover that you are the object of an intimidating drive,launched by a small number of people, who will either silence you or prevent theFederal Government from funding you. Most of the available research that bearson genetic, biological, or early childhood effects on crime is from abroad. Evenabroad, it is increasingly difficult to pursue such questions. Other aspects of the causes of violence (and there are in fact many aspects to the causes of violence) are encouraged to be researched, and therefore there isa kind of imbalance in our body of knowledge. Politically acceptable causesattract research support; politically unacceptable causes do not attract interest.That is, in my view, gravely unfortunate.17James Q. Wilson Adrian Curtis, Justice Management Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.: The Attorney General always says that youthful offenders should be reached before they become youthful offenders. Everyone would prefer not to be mugged or to deal with the consequences afterwards. Crimelegislation has provided authorization to fund crime prevention. It hasn't beenvery strongly supported by the Congress or by the public. Do you think itwould be a good move to put more money into prevention efforts? Or demon-stration programs? Or do you think it is an issue to be dealt with locally? JQW: I think the Federal Government has a major role to play in prevention. I think the problem is with what has been described in the past as a preventionprogram. It is, of course, a caricature to describe prevention programs as thoseinvolving \"midnight basketball,\" but that slogan has caught on because it is notrefuted by any evidence that we know of for any better prevention practice. Wehave had a lot of efforts at supported work projects, many of them using veryrigorous evaluation methods. If you place juvenile offenders in job training andsupportive work environments and, after 18 months, compare their offendingrates to those of youths who did not experience this, no difference exists. Although remedial education programs are sometimes reported to be success- ful, the body of research suggests that they don't make a difference. To me, thecritical years in a child's life are zero to five. If you have a prevention effort,that's where you have to aim it. The government and the public understandthis. Everyone who has been a parent and has watched his or her childrengrow up in such remarkably different ways\u2014begin to express their characterand interact with their parents\u2014knows how critical that period is. If we aregoing to have an effective prevention program, I think we have to say thatthose are the critical years, and we have to focus our imagination on thoseyears. We have to develop, with Federal support and evaluation, programs thatwill provide differing ways of managing that period of life. We don't reallyknow what the best programs are, but there are lots of experiments out there18What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? (none of them really being evaluated by anyone). So we have something to build on. If we focused our prevention efforts around the core issue of the family, and took advantage of the great popular and political support for family issues, wecould move the prevention program ahead. But if we just talk about \"preven-tion,\" people will think we mean supported work projects, remedial education,or midnight basketball, and it won't succeed. Janie Jeffers, President's Crime Prevention Council, Washington, D.C.: Professor Wilson, through your lens, you paint a bleak picture for juveniles.What you saw as perhaps a glimmer of hope, as a result of the Crime Actlegislation, was the group homes, etc. Where do you see the support for thefamily, to shore up the family\u2014not to replace the family in what would be atbest an artificial and short-lived kind of activity? You spoke about preventionrelated to children between 0 and 5, but I'd like to hear where you see thefamily needing support, what interventions you think are appropriate, andwhat kinds of research in those areas should be done to avoid supplanting thepurpose and need for families. JQW: I wish I knew the answer to your question, but I do not. The growth in single-parent families cuts across all the Western industrial nations. The rate ishighest in the United States, but it is very large in Western Europe, England,France, and Japan. It is being driven by profound changes in Western culture.It is, in my view, the final working out of the 18th century enlightenment. Ifyou really believe in the emancipation of the individual, there will come atime when men will feel themselves freed from the responsibility of maintain-ing families. Men are a difficult species. It has taken many years of hectoring,bloodshed, religious indoctrination, cultural pressure, etc., to get them to takecare of the women they made pregnant and the children to whom the womenhave given birth.19James Q. Wilson If you really believe in emancipating the individual right down to the grassroots, and we have seen this in Western cultures, you will see the removal of the manfrom this family role. The best idea I can come up with is to change the way weraise at-risk children so that they will grow up in an environment during theirformative years in which they value a family experience and see men and womenworking together to help raise them. As they get that formative experience, itwill guide them into a desire to repeat that experience in their adult lives.Whether that will work or not, I don't know. Relative to the pressures that areworking against the family, I don't think there are any simple policy remedies. Idon't think tax rate changes, or forced financial support, or even tightening thedivorce laws (although there are worthwhile ideas in some of these initiatives forchange) will make a big difference. They are like small handfuls of sand thrownin the face of a gale wind. Unless we face the fact that we are dealing with a profound cultural transforma- tion throughout the West and attempt to change the influences on young peopleso that they will attempt to stand against that force, then I don't think we willsucceed. Ted Gest, U.S. News & World Report, Washington, D.C.: Could you give us some idea of the scale you are talking about when you say \"more research?\"Everybody in this room thinks we need more research on crime. Are yousaying that we need as much research as we have for various diseases? Butother people would point out that we already are doing more research throughthe 1994 Crime Bill and the National Science Foundation. Are you recom-mending a massive increase\u2014a sort of modern day \"Manhattan Project\" oncrime, or are you speaking about targeted modest increases in specific areas? JQW: My remarks this morning would have had greater force before the passage of the 1994 Crime Act. I think there has been a significant increase in research.The National Institute of Justice now has resources and commitment that it hasnever enjoyed in the past. That is all good. I'm not confident that we need a20What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? dramatic increase in funding. We don't have that many good researchers in this field. The few we have are very busy. More will be recruited, just as in theaftermath of the passage of the Law Enforcement Assistance Act. That openedup Federal research efforts. The criminological effort was revitalized whenoperations research, industrial micro-economics, etc., elbowed into this areawith a new way of looking at things. I would like to see Congress make permanent, if nothing else, the present commitment to research and demonstration efforts, by authorizing programsthat set aside a given fraction of however much money Congress may chooseto appropriate for the purpose of aiding significant Federal or local programs. I don't call for a Manhattan Project. I would be satisfied with the present level of resources if we could make it permanent so that the next administration,whatever it is, would not find it so easy to change. Morris Thigpen, National Institute of Corrections, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.: Would you mind commenting on the sentencing practices that we are seeing across the country today? What do you think ofthose in your own State of California\u2014the \"three strikes and you're out\" lawsand the whole truth-in-sentencing push that is occurring? JQW: It's difficult to comment on sentencing policies without taking into account the enormous public frustration with what is perceived to be our currentsentencing policy. In California, the sentencing policies before \"three strikes\"were lamentable. If you illegally kill another human being in the State ofCalifornia\u2014not as an accident\u2014from manslaughter to first-degree murder, youraverage time in prison would have been less than 4 years. The public may notunderstand certain details, but they don't like that. So when someone camealong with three-strikes legislation, people wanted the legislators to vote for it. We have had a lot of problems with this three-strikes bill. It focuses heavily on adult offenders. It reserves serious penalties for the second and third strike. It is somewhatunclear as to what prior offenses should count as a strike. Local district attorneys are21James Q. Wilson displaying a considerable amount of unstudied variance in how they define a prior strike and therefore in the proportion of people that they send to prison. Our problem is not simply to defeat these measures; it is to come up with something that is better. California hadn't done that. California didn't takethe killing of another human being very seriously except in very high-profilecases\u2014freeway strangling or whatever. If we do that (and many large States inthe country do), we have a problem. I don't know how to put that genie back in the bottle. Rather than modifying the three-strikes bill, I would prefer if something other than it had been passedin the first place. I would strongly prefer that people mobilize their answers onhow we handle juvenile offenders, who are eventually going to turn into thosepersons who are eligible for three-strikes. The only way to do that is to showthe public that we know enough about the subject so that we can direct theirattention effectively. Misguided in some aspects as these laws are, we have to realize that we didn't give the people any alternative to choose. Betty Chemers, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.: The juvenile justice system is clearly under great stress, with more and more juveniles being waived to theadult court. Do you think the juvenile court has outlived its usefulness? JQW: I wish I knew the answer to whether the juvenile court has outlived its usefulness. My sense is that the juvenile court is many different things in manydifferent States. In California it is in serious trouble. I believe in New York Stateit is approaching total collapse. In Indiana, as a matter of fact, it is workingrather well. We don't know what juvenile courts are doing. I believe that the essential22premise of the juvenile court deserves serious reexamination. The central premise of the juvenile court is that the court would stand in loco parentis. Itwould replace the parents for children who were runaways, truants, shoplifters,or engaging in activities indicating a failure of parental supervision. It was notinvented at a time when 13-year-olds carrying Uzis were mowing down inno-cent babies on street corners. How should the juvenile court be reshaped, if that is its role? Some of its functions should be split perhaps into several parts. It should be a State agencythat acts in loco parentis, and it should not limit its attention to youngsterswho have already shot, or mugged, or stolen at large. It should turn its atten-tion at the first sign of difficulty to people who begin to experience problems,where parents are doing a poor job. But other functions of the juvenile courtshould be shifted to a different kind of entity. Not necessarily the court, but adifferent kind of entity that has the task of identifying early on who the repeatoffenders are. Not after their first arrest or conviction, but after a second timeor a third time. Once you pass that transition\u2014the third standard deviation\u2014you are very likely to become a chronic serious offender. We need to identifythose people as early as possible and to deal with them by increasing themagnitude of penalties they face from at least the second offense on. Everytime they do something again, the penalty gets worse. I don't think the juvenile courts are doing this. I think they waive juveniles out of the system for the first, second, or third serious offense. Then finally, theyunload on them and put them in incarceration until they are 25. That's not theway we raise our children. We don't ignore their misdeeds until finally they burndown the house. In our daily lives, we use moderate rewards and penalties inraising our children so that they become habituated to a life of decency. Thejuvenile court does not follow the principles of decent family life. The court was founded on the principle of acting in loco parentis. We need juvenile courts that will be much more heavily funded than the present onesare, will take very seriously the first signs of repeat offending among juveniles,and will be very serious about the penalties they impose.What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime?23Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better?Some Consequences of Ignoringthe Unattractive * Presentation by Peter Reuter, Ph.D. University of Maryland February 11, 1997 Washington, D.C. United States drug policies are punitive (in both rhetoric and reality), divisive (certainly by race, probably by age, and perhaps by class), intrusive (in small ways for many indi-viduals and in large ways for some groups), and expensive ($30billion annually). Even more distressing, the Nation has a drugproblem more severe than that of any other rich Westernsociety, whether measured in terms of the extent of drug use,dependence on expensive drugs, drug-related AIDS cases, or thelevel of violence and corruption associated with these drugs. *This paper is derived from a lecture at the April 1992 American Philosophical Society 1992 meeting, which was originally published as \"Hawks Ascendant,\"Daedalus 1992. That paper was updated and delivered as a lecture at the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) series Perspectives on Crime and Justice in February 1997. The paper based on the NIJ lecture was published in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 141, No. 3, September 1997, and is reproduced here with minor stylistic changes. The research reported here was supported by a grant fromthe Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to RAND's Drug Policy Research Center. It drawsheavily on work done jointly with Robert MacCoun, who provided valuablecomments on the paper.24Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? Many contend that the problems are a consequence of our policies. Either it is the harshness of those policies that has generated the disease and violent crime thatsurround drug use (the standard liberal critique), 1 or it is the lack of effective stringency that explains why drugs are so widely used and available (the hawks'critique). 2 Yet this may give too much credit to the role of policy, a common fallacy in modern American discussions, particularly in the Nation's Capital,whose business is precisely policy. Whether or not there is an epidemic of experi-mentation with a particular drug, what fraction of experimenters goes on tobecome dependent, and the severity of health and crime consequences of depen-dence may be much more shaped by factors other than policy. Certainly whencomparing America's drug problems with those of other nations, most of therelevant differences appear to be rooted in broader features of societies. For ex-ample, the United States is characterized by greater hedonism, weak informalsocial control, a higher propensity for risk taking, inadequate provision of healthcare for the poor, unequal income distribution, and a high level of criminalviolence generally. It is also more intimately connected with cocaine- and opium-growing regions such as Colombia and Mexico. All these factors promote use ofillicit psychoactive drugs and/or worsen the problems associated with that use.If policy is only moderately important in controlling drug use, then perhaps wecan mitigate the harshness of our policies with little risk of seeing an expansionof drug use and related problems. Reducing our drug policy problems (i.e., the adverse consequences of the policies themselves) is worth a good deal, thoughit would obviously be even more desirable if we could also reduce our drugproblem. It is hard to be highly prescriptive, to say what good drug policy would look like, because one consequence of politicians' treating drug control as a moralcrusade has been an absolute lack of interest, bordering on gross negligence, inassessing the consequences, good or bad, of the emphasis on punishment. Wecannot say, even approximately, whether locking up more drugdealers orseizing lots of assets has any substantial effect on drug prices or whether higherprices would have much effect on American drug usage or related violence.25Peter Reuter There is no credible basis for describing a policy that would reduce, in any important dimension, the extent of America's drug problems by, say, one-thirdin the next 5 years. What I will offer is a set of reasonable conjectures, but a central message of this paper is that without systematic evaluation of the consequences of drug enforce-ment and punishment, the current stagnation of drug policies will almostcertainly continue. Characterizing American Drug Policies and Problems Policies. The most striking characteristics of the U.S. response to illicit drugs in the last decade have been its scale and punitiveness. The Federal Govern-ment spends about $15 billion annually on drug control. State and localgovernments probably spend at least as much. 3 Thus drug control is a $30-35 billion government program in the mid-1990s, massively up from about $6-7billion in 1985. By comparison, the figure for all public law enforcementexpenditures was about $110 billion in 1996. The intended punitiveness is reflected in budgets. About three-quarters of the national drug control budget is spent on apprehending and punishing drugdealers and users, with treatment getting about two-thirds of the remainder.State and local governments are even more enforcement oriented than theFederal Government. Budgetarily they exhibit a disdain for prevention, eventhough this is primarily a school-based activity, which seems naturally to flowfrom local governments. The total punishment levied for drug control purposes has increased massively since 1981, when the concern with cocaine became prominent. The number ofcommitments to State and Federal prison have risen approximately tenfoldover the same period. By 1994, there were almost 400,000 people in prison orjail serving time for selling or using drugs. The comparable figure for 1980 wasabout 31,000 (see exhibit 1).26Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? At the State level, one striking feature is the large number of persons being impris- oned for drug possession felonies. This does not include possession with intent to distribute, which is classified as a distribution offense. Approximately 50,000 weresentenced to State prison in 1992 for nondistribution offenses, mostly simplepossession; some may have been plea bargained down from distribution charges. Sentencing figures are of themselves insufficient to show that enforcement has become more stringent. That depends on the ratio of sentences (or years of prisontime) to offenses. Imprisonment may hardly have kept up with the growth of drugmarkets. The number of offenses might have risen as rapidly as arrests, sentences, andyears of prison time between 1980 and 1985, when cocaine consumption was stillexpanding rapidly. But from 1985 to 1995 it is very likely that the number of offenses(transactions) and buyers and sellers was essentially flat. The risk of being imprisonedfor a cocaine or heroin user or seller went up very sharply, perhaps nearly tenfold. How risky is drugselling or drug possession? The aggregate data suggest that in 1994 a cocaine user had an 8-percent risk of being arrested; for a heroin userthe figure may have been 10 percent. For drugselling, Robert MacCoun and Iestimated in a study of the District of Columbia, that in 1988, street dealers ofExhibit 1: Trends in Drug Enforcement, 1980-1994 1980 1985 1990 1994 Drug Arrests 581,000 811,000 1,090,000 1,350,000 Heroin 391,000 Local 19,000 111,000 137,000 State Prisons 19,000 39,000 149,000 202,000 Federal Prisons 4,900 9,500 30,500 51,800 Sources: Uniform Crime Reports, Correctional Population in the United States . Jail figures are author's estimates. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand except for Federal prison populations.27Peter Reuter drugs faced about a 22-percent probability of imprisonment in the course of a year's selling and that, given expected time served, they spent about one-third of their selling career in prison. 4 These figures on sellers are somewhat higher than crude calculations at the national level for more recent years. Does this make drugselling appropriately risky? One-third of a career in prison seems quite a lot. On the other hand, the risk per sale is very smallindeed. In our Washington, D.C., study a seller who worked 2 days a week atthis trade made about 1,000 transactions in the course of a year. His impris-onment risk per transaction was about 1 in 4,500; by that metric, drugsellingis a great deal less risky than, say, a burglary or robbery. Another way toassess the risk is to look at aggregate figures. It is estimated that Americanusers consume 300 tons of cocaine per annum. If these are sold in 1-gramunits, this represents 300 million transactions, which result in fewer than100,000 prison sentences. This generates a prison risk for a single cocainesales transaction of about 1 in 3,000. The punitiveness of American drug policy is not simply captured in numbers. It is also an element of rhetoric and other programs. The 1996 Presidentialcandidates competed, albeit briefly and unconvincingly, in efforts to demon-strate their toughness; no other aspect of drug policy merited a mention.Senator Dole accused the administration of failing to make adequate use of themilitary, particularly in the interdiction campaign. President Clinton re-sponded by proposing that teenagers be drug tested when they apply for adriver's license. More recently, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, in what wasbilled as a major address on domestic policy initiatives, proposed life sentencesfor those trafficking across State boundaries and death sentences for thesecond offense. Even the new Federal welfare reform package includes its very own antidrug clause. Unless a State affirmatively opts out, it must deny Federal benefits to anyapplicant who has been convicted of a post-1996 drug felony. As a deterrent, it28Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? presumes a peculiar long-sightedness on the part of offenders. It can reasonably be called spiteful, though it is not as mean-spirited as Senator Gramm's originalversion, which imposed loss of a wide range of public benefits for any drugconviction. It certainly serves no welfare goal to cut off those convicted at age18 for simple possession of small amounts of crack, as in California, from a rightto welfare at age 35. What Has Toughness Accomplished? Toughness should raise prices, make drugs less accessible, and reinforce mes-sages that drugs are disapproved of and harmful. This should lead to less druguse and eventually fewer drug-related problems. In fact, illegal drugs areremarkably expensive, not universally accessible, and generally feared. Never-theless, it is striking that, notwithstanding sharply increased stringency, pricesare declining, many of the young see drugs as quite easy to get, and the fear ofthe most widely used drug (marijuana) is declining. 5 Illicit drugs are very expensive by most measures. Marijuana is a cultivatedweed like tobacco, but while a cigarette costs, even with excise taxes, hardly10 cents, an equivalent amount of marijuana costs $5 or more. Heroin, aprocessed agricultural good like sugar, is vastly more expensive than gold,costing about $5,000 per ounce (wholesale), compared to gold's $400. All the same, cocaine and heroin prices have fallen steadily since 1981. By 1995, after adjusting for inflation, they were only about one-third of their 1981 levels.For marijuana, prices rose steadily and substantially from 1981 to 1992 and thenfell in the next 4 years back to their 1981 level. Even more surprising is JonCaulkins' finding that crack cocaine, singled out for tough sentencing both atthe national level and in some major States (e.g., California), is no more expen-sive at the retail level than powder cocaine in terms of price per pure milligram.29Peter Reuter This failure of cocaine and heroin prices to rise with tougher enforcement is a major analytic and policy puzzle. Declining demand, reduced labor marketopportunities for aging drug user/sellers, a decline in violence engendered byfew new entrants and lower margins, and the locking up of criminal users arejust some of the possible factors contributing to this. None of these has beensubject to systematic examination. If enforcement did not raise prices for the drugs, then it might still have been successful if it lowered availability. The only long-term data come from theannual survey of high school seniors and suggest otherwise. For example, 80 to90 percent of the students reported that marijuana is available or very availableto them\u2014figures that have been stable for two decades. The percentage ofseniors reporting that cocaine was available or readily available was 46 percentin 1995, compared to 30 percent in 1980, though down somewhat from its 1989high of 55 percent. The finding that marijuana is perceived as more available tohigh school students than alcohol or cigarettes has been widely reported. Drug use was estimated to be half as prevalent in 1995 as in the early 1980s, but it is now growing, albeit very slowly. In 1995 the percentage of those overtwelve who reported using an illicit drug in the previous month was 6 percent,compared to 14 percent in 1981. 6 The numbers dependent on cocaine and heroin have been fairly stable over a long period of time\u2014at about 2.5 million.It seems likely that the severity of the Nation's drug problem as measured bythe related violence and health costs has also been fairly stable over thatperiod of time, though declining somewhat since about 1990. In some cities it appears that local enforcement has driven open-air markets indoors. Driving around with police in Washington, D.C., one certainly observesmuch more circumspect behavior than was true in the late 1980s. This may be amajor accomplishment. Open-air markets not only ease access for users movingfrom experimentation to regular consumption, they also breed violence anddisorder. 730Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? In summary, increasing toughness has not accomplished its immediate objec- tives of raising prices and reducing availability. Drug use has declined, but themost proximate cause, as reported in the high school senior survey, seems to bea shift in attitudes as to the risks and approval of use of specific drugs. Thoughenforcement might influence those perceptions, there is no correlation be-tween crude measures of toughness and those perceptions. But toughness clearly has had other consequences as well.Divisiveness. It is hard to analyze drug enforcement in contemporary America without reference to race. 8 In 1992 blacks (12 percent of the general popula- tion) constituted two-thirds of admissions to State prison for drug offenses,compared to slightly less than one-half for all nondrug offenses. A similardisproportion existed for Hispanics; 10 percent of the population, they consti-tuted 25 percent of all those sent to prison for drug offenses. The origins of this disproportion are a matter of controversy. The standard critique is that the population of drug users is predominantly white; differencesin prevalence rates for drug use (even crack) are far too modest to overcome thevastly larger white population. Therefore, drugdealers should be primarily white.This argument is at best incomplete. Sellers are a select group of users; they arelikely to be poorer and more deviant than users generally, since selling is riskyand widely condemned. The urban poor are disproportionately minority. Racism may play a role, but a lot is driven by the police responsiveness to concerns about drugselling and the violence and disorder around inner-citymarkets. Focusing on those involved in the street selling of expensive drugs(essentially anything other than marijuana) is likely to generate disproportion-ate numbers of arrests among poor, young, central-city males, who are temptedinto this business both by the unattractiveness of their legitimate economicopportunities and the accessibility of these selling opportunities. 9 These populations are again disproportionately minority.31Peter Reuter Drugselling has indeed become a common activity among poor and minority urban males. For Washington, D.C., my colleagues and I estimated that overone-quarter of African-American males born in the 1960s were charged withdrugselling between the ages of 18 and 24. 10 Most were charged with a drug felony, and most will be convicted of that offense. But it is what happens after arrest that generates much of the controversy. In particular, the disproportion in sentences for crack offenses, for which arrests areoverwhelmingly of blacks and Hispanics, has been a major political issue. This,together with the difficulty of articulating any credible grounds for maintainingthe current Federal disparity, has increased suspicion in the black communitythat drug enforcement is an instrument of continuing white oppression. Tomand Mary Edsall report that focus groups in the early 1990s found that manyblacks believed that drug enforcement was part of an effort by the white commu-nity to oppress blacks. 11 Nor is this the only division in society arising from tough drug policies. For theyoung, the growing harshness of rhetoric and policy regarding marijuana\u2014arrests for simple possession having doubled in the last 5 years\u2014reduces thecredibility of government generally. The claims about marijuana's dangers inboth public rhetoric and school prevention programs seem grossly exaggeratedand indeed lack much scientific basis. For Department of Health and HumanServices (DHHS) Secretary Donna Shalala to say, as she did in a recentmeeting, that marijuana is comparable to crack in its dangerousness, is todisparage science and reason. 12 Marijuana is not good for health but represents less threat in that respect thando alcohol and cigarettes; no one dies of the acute effects of marijuana andeven the long-term effects are surprisingly modest. The negative effects ofmarijuana use on adolescent development are clearer but still modest. Theseare not arguments for legalization (indeed, they argue more for prohibition ofcigarettes and alcohol), but they create a tension when so much emphasis is32Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? placed on the health effects of the only one of these substances that is not legally promoted and is disproportionately consumed by the young. Intrusiveness. A whole array of legal innovations has been justified by the need to end the \"scourge of drugs,\" to use President Bush's memorable 1989phrase. Drug-dealer \"profiling\" by police has allowed them to undertakenumerous searches with barely plausible cause; most of those searched areagain either minority or young or both. 13 Drug testing of Federal employees (such as those in the Executive Office of the President) for purely symbolicpurposes has demeaned public service. Some States require that candidates forState offices be tested for drugs for symbolic purposes; the Supreme Court in1997 unanimously ruled against this requirement for Georgia. Preventivedetention, a particularly chilling power, has been extended in the context ofthe Controlled Substances Act. Drug policy is clearly getting harsher in this respect. Some jurisdictions are contemplating testing welfare recipients for drug use and disqualifying those whocannot remain drug-free. Abe Rosenthal of The New York Times , the most prominent of the columnist drug hawks, quickly pounced on President Clinton'sproposal that all teenage applicants for driver's licenses be subject to a drug test,suggesting that this was not nearly enough, and that the logic and facts spoke tothe need to do random tests of young adults as well, since they are the highestrisk group. 14 The Punitive Cycle. The response to emerging drug problems in this country is invariably punitive: the first twitch is to raise the statutory penalty for someoffense. This was true in 1996 when methamphetamine showed signs ofmoving out of its long-established western base in San Diego, Dallas, etc. Ithas not yet happened for marijuana at the Federal level, somewhat surpris-ingly, but various States are moving in that direction. For example, theVirginia Senate recently passed an increase in maximum sentences for marijuanapossession offenses; a second conviction can result in a 4-year prison sentence.33Peter Reuter This is truly a vicious cycle, since the argument for raising the sentence for offenses involving a particular drug are mostly that the current sentence is lessthan that for other drugs, which encourages sellers to pick that drug. Thissystematically generates sentence inflation. Indeed, many in Congress re-sponded to the claim of imbalance between crack and powder cocaine bysuggesting dramatically increasing penalties for powder. In May 1997 the U.S.Sentencing Commission, defeated in its previous effort at reducing the sen-tencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine by lowering the crackpenalties, made recommendations that would increase the powder penalties,while trying again to lower the disparity. The intrusive and divisive elements of our policies are not inherent in prohibi- tion. Even harsh punishment is not inherent in prohibition; consider howlightly we enforce laws against prostitution. 15 However, they arise remorselessly out of the logic of drug scares, under the assumption that tougher policies willmake a difference. There is some understanding that racial disparity and theloss of civil liberties are not trivial harms but this rubs up against the unques-tioned assumption that another major goal is importantly served by thesemeasures, namely reductions in drug problems. Comparing the U.S. and Western Europe Perhaps we suffer no more from illicit drugs and clumsy drug policies thanother developed countries with more wealth than self-control. Rob MacCounand I have been studying the experiences of 10 Western European countries,all of which have had significant problems with heroin and marijuana; somehave also experienced cocaine or methamphetamine problems. 16 European innovations in tolerant drug policy, such as the Dutch coffee shopsand the Swiss heroin maintenance trials, attract a fair amount of attention inthe United States. But most Western European drug policy is firmly in theprohibitionist legal framework and, with respect to drugselling, these countries34Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? are, by their standards, aggressive both in enforcing the laws and in the length of sentences served by traffickers. They are, with Sweden and France as inter-esting exceptions, very much less aggressive towards drug users than is theUnited States. They are, again with the exception of Sweden and France,strong supporters of needle exchange programs and other efforts to reduce HIVrisk behaviors among intravenous drug users. As the British Advisory Councilon the Misuse of Drugs famously said in 1987, \"Drugs are an important prob-lem. AIDS is a more important problem.\" 17 None of these countries has a problem with illicit drugs comparable to that inthe United States, mostly because they have not experienced a major epidemicof cocaine use. The highest reported figure we have been able to find for lifetimemarijuana use among high school seniors is 36 percent in Spain, compared tomore than 50 percent in the United States in recent years; for most Europeancountries the figure is closer to one-quarter. Heroin addiction in some countries,notably Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, approaches the U.S. rate of about 2-3 per1,000 population. But if one adds in cocaine, the U.S. figures for the prevalenceof addiction are at least twice that of any European country. Even starker is the difference in violence, though this is all impressionistic. I interviewed a senior Zurich police official during the period when the cityallowed drugsellers and buyers to operate openly in a park, called the Platzspitz,near the train station. The official was complaining about how bad the crimesituation had become because of the drug market. He showed me a list of the31 major crime incidents in the park in 1990. The list included a fight with apoliceman and precisely one homicide. This for a park in which many hun-dreds of drug dealers and buyers, using heroin and some cocaine, congregatedevery day! Similarly, in other European cities the drug market generates theftand disorder but not high levels of violence. AIDS related to intravenous drug use has been a significant problem in some European countries, with France, Italy, and Switzerland the most badly35Peter Reuter affected. But neither in terms of the fraction of intravenous drug users who are HIV-positive, nor in the fraction of the population that is HIV-positive, as theresult of drug use, do the figures for any European country approach those forthe United States. Should we attribute the smaller drug problems in Europe to their policies? Rob MacCoun and I see little basis for this. Take the violence for example. Thelow level of violence in crime generally, perhaps itself the result of the smallnumber of guns, is more plausible a factor than any policy action by police orthe criminal justice system. The absence of a significant cocaine epidemic canhardly be attributed to enforcement; prices are now down near to U.S. levelsdespite increasing seizures. The greater strength of families in SouthernEurope, the better safety net for those who are long-term unemployed, and thesmaller fraction of young males growing up in poor female-headed households,are plausibly more important. It is hard to do any formal testing with theavailable data, but this seems to us a reasonable interpretation. Interestingly, the choice of drug policy by nations is more influenced by views about the role of government, as well as by views about what constitutes thedrug problem. For example, the Swedish population accepts a paternalisticstate and will tolerate highly intrusive rules, including compulsory drugtreatment even without an arrest. In Spain there are no criminal penalties forthe possession of small amounts of any psychoactive drug; this represents less adecision about drug policy than a response to the long experience with theauthoritarian Franco regime, which has created a strong suspicion of any lawsthat allow the government to regulate private conduct. Europeans generallysee illicit drugs as primarily a personal and health problem, a position consis-tent with the lower levels of drug-related violence. The U.S. public sees illegaldrugs as a crime problem; almost all speeches and most newspaper articles referto \"drugs and crime.\" For a nation that sees crime as something to be solved bypunishment, that is enough to sustain a set of laws and programs that maketoughness their centerpiece.36Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? A Role for Research Clearly there are policy alternatives to our current regime, even if we stick with prohibition. For any proposal involving less harshness the central issue is assess-ing the consequences of a highly punitive approach. At a minimum it would beuseful to say whether longer prison sentences, more drug seizures, or moreintensive money-laundering investigations can increase prices or reduce avail-ability, and what effect these changes would have on drug use by current orprospective users and on drug-related problems. Not a single empirical paperattempts to answer that question. The closest one gets is a paper of 25 years ago,which found that higher prices for heroin increased property crimes in Detroit. 18 There has been a little progress lately in estimating the price elasticity of de-mand for various drugs and various populations 19 but that is just a small first step. Oddly enough, we can say a great deal more about the effects of treatment and prevention, which account for no more than 20 percent of this Nation's publicexpenditures on drug control, than about the consequences of enforcement. 20 Even more oddly, that is the result of the dedication to punishment; any otherprogram that is not punishment has to justify itself against the suspicion that itis kind to criminals (treatment) or is too diffuse (prevention). Since punish-ment is what drug users and drugsellers deserve, there is little need (in the eyesof politicians and perhaps the public) for these programs to demonstrate theireffectiveness. Thus, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has a researchbudget of $450 million; research on drug enforcement has to fight for its shareof the National Institute of Justice's (NIJ's) paltry $30 million annual budget,albeit that money is tripled by various evaluations and earmarks. Twentymillion dollars is certainly far too generous an estimate of the funding forresearch related to drug enforcement. One can usefully adapt a complaint of the public health research world to explain this situation. Prevention advocates object that whereas surgicalprocedures only have to be safe and medicines safe and effective, prevention37Peter Reuter programs have to be demonstrated safe, effective, and cost-effective. The corollary for drug enforcement is that it doesn't even have to be safe, let aloneeffective or cost-effective. Drug enforcement has become a crusade, andcrusaders scarcely need a map, let alone evaluation. The Federal enforcement agencies sponsor no research themselves, notwith- standing Federal program expenditures of about $10 billion. The Drug Enforce-ment Administration (DEA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) maygenerously be called nonanalytic; more accurately, they are anti-analytic. Notonly do they lack any capacity for internal policy analysis, they seem to lackeven the ability to contract with external research organizations. The DEA'sinability to report price data in a meaningful way, despite gathering about 5,000observations each year, is symptomatic of this. Surely no other Federal agency inthe 1990s would report the highest and lowest figures as a range, without anymeasure of central tendency. To report that the price for marijuana went from arange of $25-$450 in 1993 to a range of $40-$450 in 1994 is to simply informthe world that these data are irrelevant. Clearly a large research and analysis program is needed that has the depth and durability to develop more credible measures of the intensity of treatment andthe size of the drug problem in a particular community. We need to takeaccount of the enormous variation in the intensity of enforcement and severityof sentencing that seems to exist across cities and States. For example, inTexas in 1992 the median prison sentence for those convicted of drug traffick-ing was 10 years, compared to only 2 years for those in Washington State. Itshould be possible to build on the improvements in the drug data indicatorsbeing developed by various Federal agencies. Why is there so little research on drug enforcement? Surely part of the answer is simply that there is, as James Q. Wilson noted in a recent lecture, 21 shock- ingly little research on crime control generally. But another factor, I conjec-ture, is a curious confluence of liberal and conservative interests. Those who38Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? support tough drug enforcement see no gain in evaluation; Peter Rossi's oft- cited comment, \"If you don't like a program, evaluate it,\" is highly relevant.Liberals find the whole effort distasteful enough that they simply want nothing todo with it; in particular, they don't want to evaluate it for the purposes of makingit work better. They would much rather focus on the programs in which they havefaith and in which they passionately believe, namely prevention and treatment. Conclusion But a society that deliberately averts its eyes from an honest assessment of amassive and frequently cruel intervention that sacrifices so many other goalsfor the one desideratum of drug abstinence can scarcely expect to find a well-grounded alternative. I am struck by the lack of any nuanced debate aboutdrug policy, beyond the ungrounded and polarizing legalization shouting matchand the banal and marginal discussion of how the Federal drug budget shouldbe spent. Welfare reform, public housing policies, and income support gener-ally may do more to affect drug abuse and related problems than those pro-grams that claim to explicitly target them, yet there is rarely any seriousdiscussion of their role in drug policy. In John LeCarr\u00e9's The Honourable Schoolboy , George Smiley finds some evi- dence that a prominent Chinese businessman in Hong Kong may be a Com-munist spy. Launching an investigation in Hong Kong is both politicallysensitive and expensive, so he has to convene a meeting of the Foreign Office,Treasury, and other agencies to get authorization and funds. The ForeignOffice is aghast; if the investigation were to become public and the business-man were innocent, it would be a major political embarrassment. On the otherhand, the Governor in Hong Kong entertains and trusts this businessman, andindeed may recommend him for knighthood; it would be equally embarrassingif it turned out that he was a spy! They become increasingly panicked andpress Smiley for a judgment; is he a spy? Smiley inscrutably says he cannot39Peter Reuter answer without doing the investigation. The end of the story is of course that they give him the money and the authority, because the answer must be found. That is the situation we face with respect to drug policy. If we want to know the answer as to whether we can make prohibition less expensive, divisive, andintrusive\u2014and maybe reduce the American drug problem\u2014then we can'texpect anyone to give a persuasive answer who is not provided the money andauthority to find out what our tough enforcement actually accomplishes. Doing less rarely attracts much support for dealing with a problem that still concerns large parts of the community. But this may be the only responsiblerecommendation that can be made now. Locking up drug offenders forshorter terms, worrying more about the racial disparities in sentencingpolicies, and giving up fewer of our civil liberties for unlikely reductions indrug problems may be the best one can do at the moment. That would meanless intrusive, divisive, and expensive policies and perhaps little increase indrug problems. Researchers are always inclined to think that learning and understanding are important for policy. The failure of the repeated findings that drug treatmenthas a very high benefit-cost ratio to make a policy impact 22 is a sober reminder that the political decisionmaking here is driven by other considerations. Butwe might actually see something approximating a reasonable discussion of thealternatives in front of the Nation if a more credible base of empirical analysiswas available. In its absence we are doomed to rhetorical debate.40Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? Question-and-Answer Session Adrian Curtis, Justice Management Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.: Based on the Maryland State Legislature's consideration of the same kind of legislation that Virginia has passed and your testimony toCongress, what kind of reaction do you get from elected officials when you talkto them about \"less may be better?\" P. R.: I don't have enough one-on-one contact with elected officials to answer that. Because the Nation still believes that drug crime is near the top of the listof domestic problems and because of the ease with which people can be per-suaded that being less tough is a danger to the Nation in terms of worseningthe problem, I think that the political gains associated with this are very slight.I make no claims that this is a politically feasible path. I am a policy analystmore than a political analyst. In terms of policy, one can make a case that we punish beyond reason. You asked me whether that is sellable; I can't say much to that. That unreasonable disparities in sentencing exist is something that many officials accept as a problem. And that was the one issue on which a realleadership for reform could be found in Congress. But it is striking how hard itis to identify leaders in either the Senate or the House who support anythingmore than marginal shifts in drug policy. Most of the debate is about whetherwe should spend more on treatment and less on enforcement, which is not theright way to think about this problem. Each program should be evaluated onits own merits. Beyond that, it is striking how little high-level nuanced discussion takes place about drug policy in Congress. I have that sense about State Houses too,although I don't track them closely.41Peter Reuter Samuel Dash, Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.: In your talk, you touched from time to time on violence related to severe andaggressive drug enforcement, and you made some comparison briefly betweenEurope and the United States. Other than our being known as a violentcommunity, to what extent have the studies shown what people often believe,as you do, namely that aggressive drug enforcement has increased street crimelike burglaries and other types of theft offenses with violence? Do you haveevidence of that? P. R.: The answer is no; I do not have evidence. But I don't quite believe the proposition you attribute to me. I want to be careful about what it is thatpolicy accomplishes. Three kinds of violence are related to drugs: 1) thepsychopharmacological effects of the drugs themselves, 2) economic compul-sive violence (some of which has to do with crime by users who commit crimesto earn the money to purchase expensive drugs), and 3) the violence thatoccurs in the course of drug distribution. Some years ago, I wrote that because of our very intense enforcement, we have generated more violence in the markets, particularly on the dealer side. That is,by being very tough, we create lots of uncertainty in the market. We movepeople around a lot, so that market-sharing arrangements are very transient. Justthe fact that lots of dealers go off to prison from time to time means that every-body's \"looking for new connections\" all the time because the old connectionsmay be lost. The FBI puts out a figure each year on the percentage of homicides that are drug related. I don't think that figure ever reached as high as 10 percent. It isnow down around 5 percent. It is a figure that has little credibility, in partbecause the process that generates it only allows one \"cause\" per homicide. It's unclear to me whether enforcement is in fact an important part of the source of violence, as opposed to the fact that a unique confluence of crimino-42Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? genic forces affect American drug markets: Young, poorly educated males with lethal weapons, enormously valuable commodities, and large quantities ofcash. It's the fact that one can hold in his hand something that's worth manythousands of dollars that really makes this market different. It may be that theextent to which the police \"churn\" this market or shape it is really much lessimportant than the confluence of those factors. But we are now in the area ofconjecture in the absence of data beyond a couple of studies in two cities, Ithink in New York and the surrounding areas, for just 1 or 2 years. James Austin, National Council on Crime and Delinquency, Washington, D.C.: There is a policy that has been floating around that I would call \"co- erced treatment\" for probationers and parolees. If they fail drug tests, they arejailed for a certain period of time. What is your opinion of that policy, and isthere any evidence that it would work? P. R.: You are talking about Mark Kleiman's proposal of \"coerced abstinence.\" Kleiman, a close collaborator of mine over many years, has been advocating forsome years (with increasing success in terms of catching public policy interest)the notion that a very large share of all the heroin and cocaine in this countryis consumed by people who are in the hands of the criminal justice system\u2014whether on pretrial release, probation, or parole. They are on conditionalliberty. The public assumes that a condition of that liberty is that they are drugtested from time to time since their criminal activity is presumed to be relatedto the use of expensive drugs. In fact, the criminal justice system does a greatdeal of drug testing. What it doesn't do much is something consistent based ontesting positive. Kleiman believes that graduated sanctions are a way to provide a structured and efficient set of incentives to staying drug-free. The first time an offendertests positive he spends overnight in jail; the second time he spends two nightsin jail, etc. An argument can be made that if this were universally applied theconsumption of heroin and cocaine could soon be substantially reduced. Ithink it is a very insightful idea.43Peter Reuter NIJ has funded an evaluation of something close to this in the Washington, D.C., court system. Preliminary results suggest that a substantial number ofpeople on pretrial release respond to those incentives, either seeking treatmenton their own or without treatment. They can substantially cut back on theirconsumption of heroin and cocaine. How universally that may work in the quagmire that makes up the U.S. criminal justice system I don't know. But it is certainly worth testing, and it is something thatcould arguably make a big difference to our drug problems in the next 5 years. Thatwould be high on the list of such alternatives, but it is speculation at this stage. Eric Sterling, Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, Washington, D.C.: Peter, I was wondering if your proposal for research and investigation is one that alsomight be directed to foundations. Most of this audience is a public sector audi-ence. In thinking about all the possible research proposals to test the questionsthat you have raised, it might be useful if your remarks were reprinted in theChronicle of Philanthropy, because the question so often asked is, \"What works?\" You are asking the question what works in the area of enforcement, and theanswer is, \"We don't know.\" What body of research proposals and questionshave been put together that could be presented to a grants administrator saying,\"Here's a whole group of tests that we think ought to be made.\" P. R.: First, let me again go back to the comment Jim Wilson made in Decem- ber, which is how little foundations are interested in crime control generally.Jim Wilson, of course, sits on many boards and can talk to any foundationpresident that he cares to call. He said, however, \"I have many allies, but Ihave never been able to get a substantial body of continuing support forresearch related to crime control out of foundations.\" The foundations are, in general, a liberal wing of the American community, and they also find drug enforcement distasteful. I think that there is very littleinterest in funding research. It's also fair to say that this is the kind of research44Why Can't We Make Prohibition Work Better? that more appropriately should be done under government auspices. There is frequently need for access to data that can only be obtained in our currentpolicy regime if there is Federal sponsorship. To bring up a case of acute interest to me, DEA collects data on drug prices; it is called STRIDE [System to Retrieve Information From Drug Evidence] and isa very large and interesting dataset for analytic purposes. It is now availableonly to Federal grantees. With a foundation grant, one cannot access thosedata. I think that STRIDE should be a public dataset, but other data exist thatare appropriately unavailable to anyone other than Federal grantees. James Boden, Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President, Washington, D.C.: I'd like you to comment on allowing the medici- nal use of marijuana in California. It seems to me you indicated one of the fewopportunities to generate some agreement on prevention rather than enforcementmay be in the marijuana area. Marijuana has been to some extent de-vilified. P. R.: Marijuana is the \"cutting edge\" drug for policy reform. One could almost imagine this country 5 years from now with a different set of laws onmarijuana. It takes a lot of imagination, but it is possible. This is inconceivablewith heroin, cocaine, and other drugs. Proposal 215 was significant in that itsignaled general discontent with marijuana policy as it now stands. About halfof those who voted for it voted on the basis that they wanted more generalreform with respect to marijuana, and about half believed it was medicine. Marijuana may or may not have medicinal uses. It is, in fact, a question for biomedical research, and it is a question that has been on the table for a longtime. There has been a real reluctance to do this, in part I think, because itrepresents biomedical research's unease with the notion that smoking anaturally occurring weed could possibly be the best therapy that modern U.S.science could come up with. That's a very important factor, but obviouslythere was a real disinclination on the part of the policy world to allow research45Peter Reuter that would make a centerpiece of the drug war look as though it had some potentially good effects. The unwillingness to do research about the possiblemedicinal uses of marijuana is one of the minor casualties of the drug war. Ihave no idea whether research on this topic would produce a positive result.But I think that doing credible research in the near future may do somethingto move the issue of medicinal use of marijuana away from drug policy. Theyare really not related. Cocaine is a Schedule II drug and is used as a topicalanesthetic in a few operations; that is not a matter of controversy. The notionthat marijuana might have medicinal purposes, precisely because it is this stage in history , generates a great deal of controversy. I think it should probably be separated from the issue of drug policy reform.47James Q. Wilson The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices Presentation by Mark H. Moore, Ph.D. Kennedy School of Government Harvard University March 11, 1997 Washington, D.C. My subject is the legitimation of the criminal justice system in the United States. It is a subject that I take extremely seriously because it is easily taken for granted thatthe system will be seen as legitimate, and, as a consequence,fail to do the work that is necessary to legitimate the systemin the eyes of the citizens who observe it, are subject to it,and seek to use it. We citizens ask a great deal from criminal justice agencies. We ask them to protect us from criminal attack\u2014and notjust from the reality but also from the fear. When criminalattacks occur, we want criminal justice authorities to sootheour indignation by catching the crooks and giving them theirjust deserts (at the same time according them the full protec-tion of their constitutional rights). We expect them toachieve these ambitious goals without reaching too deeply48The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices into our pockets for money or intruding too deeply into our privacy and free- dom. We also want reassurance that whatever money and authority is entrustedto them will be used fairly, that they will allocate effort toward those in needrather than those with ability to pay, and that they will enforce the law withoutfear or favor. Increasingly, we ask them to take a step further and, in the wordsof Attorney General Janet Reno, \"help to reweave the fabric of community.\" My purpose today is to discuss how criminal justice agencies\u2014the police, the prosecutors, the public defenders, the courts, and correctional agencies\u2014canmeet these ambitious goals. In discussing this topic, I'll adopt a managerialperspective. That is, I'll adopt the point of view of those who manage theseagencies and look for some concrete ways to use the resources entrusted to themto accomplish their broad and diverse goals. But my focus will not be on thecommon concerns of management: the downward and inward management ofpersonnel policies and procedures. It will instead be on the efforts criminaljustice agencies can and must make to legitimate themselves in the eyes of thecitizens they serve. This includes a focused effort on the particular set of encoun-ters that criminal justice agencies have with citizens, in particular: 1. Ensuring quality in their individual encounters with citizens, not only when they are providing \"service encounters\" to \"clients\" who appeal tothem for help, but also when they engage in what I would describe as an\"obligation encounter\"\u2014when they ask clients to stand still for the orderlyprocesses of justice to be visited upon them. 2. Rendering their organizations transparent and accountable to citizen \"overseers\" and their representatives, who demand assurances that theagencies are achieving their complex purposes in an appropriate way. 3. Engaging citizens as \"coproducers\" of crime control and justice in opera- tions designed to help criminal justice agencies achieve goals that theycannot achieve by themselves alone but which must include citizens in avariety of different capacities.49Mark H . Moore Finally, and most important, is the effort to extend the effect of all three of these kinds of citizen contacts by offering a kind of moral leadership that teachespeople what it is that justice requires in a democracy and, through that device,\"to help reweave the fabric of community\" that is gradually becoming tattered. In short, I am going to be much more interested in how managers of criminal justice agencies engage external actors through political and legal processes than in how efficiently they give direction and control to their employees. Myargument is that in the past the goal of enhancing the legitimacy of criminaljustice agencies and the specific efforts that are required to accomplish thisgoal have been badly neglected and to some degree misdirected. I will alsoargue that this failure has weakened not only the standing of the criminaljustice system in the eyes of the community but also, as a consequence, the realperformance of the criminal justice system. Finally, I will argue that much ofthe increased focus on community justice should be understood as increasedefforts to legitimate criminal justice agencies and capture the substantiveoperational benefits that come from such efforts. Let me start, however, by recalling the important work that the 1968 President's Crime Commission did in framing society's understanding of theoperations of criminal justice agencies and in setting an agenda for reform.One of the most enduring products of the Crime Commission's work was theimage of the criminal justice system as a large funnel that channeled criminaljustice cases through a tangle of institutional complexity and local variabilityto their ultimate disposition. This image exemplified how criminal justiceagencies were supposed to operate. Everyone understood, of course, that this was not a \"system\" in the sense that the agencies were being explicitly directed toward a particular objective bysome coherent centralized authority. It was only a system in the far morelimited sense that the different agencies were linked together through aprocess in which one agency's \"outputs\" became the next agency's \"inputs.\"50The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices Thus, police had as an output the arrest of offenders. This, in turn, became input for prosecutors and public defenders. They then developed cases as theiroutput, which went on to become the input to courts and so on. This opera-tional interdependence was thought to require some coordinated planning, ifnot central direction and control. This so-called system of criminal justice was judged to be valuable to society in two broadly different ways. First, the system was an instrument of practicalpurposes, thought to be accountable for the efficient and effective reduction ofcrime largely through four distinct mechanisms: deterrence (both general andspecific), incapacitation, and rehabilitation. That practical goal and thosepractical means were what the system as a whole seemed to be designed to do,and that was what the citizens who paid to support the system wanted as a result.That's frame one, the practical frame. But the criminal justice system was also considered important in a wholly different way, not only as a practical instrument for achieving specific results,but also as an instrument of justice\u2014a way of holding offenders accountablefor their crimes and also protecting their constitutional rights. It is importantto understand that the second idea, the criminal justice system is in place to produce justice, not just to control crime , could constitute a stand-alone justifica- tion for criminal justice system processing. From this point of view, the systemdid not have to show that it was producing any practical effect, such as reduc-ing crime; it was enough that it produce justice . Views about what constitutes justice vary widely of course, both in general and in individual cases, but thepoint is that creating justice is a different idea than that of controlling crime.Further, the production of justice could constitute a separate and completejustification for the operations of the system. Now these two evaluative frames defined two different ways in which the individual agencies in the criminal justice system (and the system as a whole)could legitimate and justify itself in the eyes of the citizenry. The system could51Mark H . Moore legitimate itself as an effective and efficient means of reducing crime. Or, it could establish itself as an important instrument of justice, a means for ensuringthat citizens lived up to their responsibilities to one another and to the society.Since both were important, the goals of reform were to advance on both frontssimultaneously: to make the criminal justice system more efficient and effectiveand to make it fairer and more just. Like all useful social conceptions, the paradigm constructed by the President's Crime Commission highlighted some important features (such as society'sresponse to crime) at the expense of others that were equally or more impor-tant parts of a more complex, underlying reality. Such simplification isinevitable in a democratic policymaking process, of course. It may even behelpful insofar as the simplification does not emphasize everything that exists , but instead focuses on those areas needing improvement. And it is entirelypossible that the Crime Commission focused society's attention on theproblems that were most important to attend to at the time its members didtheir work. There certainly was then, as there is now, a great deal to be donein improving the efficiency, effectiveness, fairness, and justice of America'scriminal justice system. Still, hindsight can be used to see what particular features of society's response to crime were underemphasized in the Crime Commission's conception andare candidates for special emphasis today in current efforts to reform andlegitimate the criminal justice system. First, the central drama evoked by the funnel image was whether a particular case and an associated offender would make it all the way through to the endof the process\u2014that is, to prison. This diagram thus suggests that the wholepoint of the exercise was to incarcerate offenders. That was the event at theend of the line toward which everything else was proceeding. This orientationignored two important facts, however. One is that most cases do not make itall the way through the system. Consequently, an important, overlooked issue52The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices is what is to be done with cases that remain unsolved or offenders who are not convicted? The second fact is that most of the criminal justice system's con-crete work or cost occurs both before and after the moment of adjudication.The community must cope with the fact that many cases cannot be resolvedand that most offenders are returned to the community sooner or later. Thatimportant reality\u2014that we live with crime and with offenders\u2014was obscured. Second, because the funnel image made the processing of cases to imprisonment so important, it naturally tended to focus attention on serious criminal cases\u2014primarily adult felonies. These are the kinds of cases that are worth elaboratescrutiny. Lesser cases such as misdemeanors or juvenile offenses are judged notworth the trouble of such elaborate processing or the expense of a prisonsentence. Besides, a sharp focus on serious offenses and offenders seems closelyallied to the goals of producing an efficient and fair criminal justice system.After all, efficiency and effectiveness demand that scarce resources be reservedfor the most serious offenses and offenders. Fairness demands that the aggres-sive use of state authority be limited to crimes that are not only prohibited butintrinsically bad. That leaves little room for discretionary decisions by officialsof whether and how to press charges. Thus, the focus on serious crime ensuresconsistency and integrity, as well as economy, in the enforcement of laws. Third, the image presented a fundamentally reactive view of crime control and thereby underemphasized some potentially important preventive opportunities.Of course, the Crime Commission did not entirely ignore prevention. Deter-rence, after all, is a preventive concept that seeks to dissuade people fromcommitting crimes by threatening them with bad consequences if they do.Incapacitation and rehabilitation, too, can be seen as preventive ideas. Theymay not prevent a potential offender's first crime, but they may well have aneffect on future offending. And given the importance of criminal recidivism andoverall patterns of crime, preventing future crimes by those who have alreadycommitted one is an important preventive contribution. The Crime Commission also insisted that the root causes of crime include poverty, economic inequality, and53Mark H . Moore racism, and that crime can only be reduced significantly by alleviating these broad social conditions\u2014the ultimate preventive argument. Still, in retrospect it seems that the Crime Commission could have noted more prominently some important opportunities for preventing crime that liebetween the limited reactions of the criminal justice system, on one hand, andbroad social actions directed at the root causes of crime, on the other. Worthmentioning are some interventions that now go under the label of \"situationalcrime prevention\" and focus on reducing opportunities for criminal offending;others, now called problem-solving or order maintenance, focus on interven-ing in the circumstances that tend to spawn crime. And there are some impor-tant interventions that the criminal justice system can make that might alterthe trajectories of youthful offenders, such as more effective enforcementagainst domestic violence and child abuse and neglect, or more determinedand sustained responses to early juvenile offending, which were mentioned butnot emphasized in the Crime Commission report. Perhaps the most important omission of the Crime Commission however was that, in focusing attention on the publicly supported agencies of the criminaljustice system, it necessarily deemphasized the role that private individuals andinstitutions of civil society\u2014families, community groups, churches, merchantassociations\u2014play in controlling crime, both by themselves and as adjuncts tothe criminal justice system. The funnel diagram did not emphasize the centralrole played by victims and witnesses in activating and focusing the attention ofcriminal justice agencies on particular crimes, nor did it point to the importantrole played by citizens who make individual and collective efforts to guardtheir own property and intervene with fellow citizens who are behaving badly.Similarly, the Crime Commission did not draw attention to the role that localmerchants play in seeking to enforce orderly conditions on the streets thatfront their stores or in providing jobs to neighborhood kids. It did not empha-size the role of church groups in giving support to single parents struggling tosupervise and raise their children. Such private efforts were viewed as beyond54The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices the boundaries of the criminal justice system\u2014efforts that might be having an effect on levels of crime and disorder but were largely independent and beyondthe reach of the agencies of the criminal justice system. This omission was, inmy view, particularly important given the points made above\u2014that the fate ofmany offenders is not to be taken from the community and that eventuallyoffenders are returned to the community for handling there. The last omission of the Crime Commission and the one most closely related to the subject of this talk is its outright dismissal of the notion that importantsources of legitimacy for the criminal justice system exist beyond the pursuit ofefficiency and lawfulness. To the Crime Commission, a kind of legitimacyrooted in moral passion and political responsiveness was viewed with greatcaution. Behind moral passion, they saw the lynch mob. Behind politicalresponsiveness, they saw the threat of political control by the powerfulagainst the weak. Thus establishing important links between criminal justiceprocessing and moral passion and politics was viewed not as a way to anchorand legitimate the system but instead as a way to expose the operations ofthe criminal justice system to powerful tides of ignorance and bias. It wassomething to be avoided rather than sought out. To do its work, the CrimeCommission believed it was better that the agencies of the criminal justicesystem be insulated from both moral passion and politics. Their legitimacywas to be established in law and professional competence rather than inresponding to the moral passions of individuals and politicians. The paradigm constructed by the Crime Commission proved to be powerful. Over the next two decades, agencies of the criminal justice system pursuedthe agenda laid out for them with great enthusiasm. They made significantprogress in increasing their professionalism and technical knowledge and inreducing racial and class biases in system operations. By rights, this progressshould have increased the standing and overall effectiveness of the system.Instead, they decreased. The popular legitimacy of the system faded even as the system was becoming fairer and more effective. Legislatures took discretion55Mark H . Moore back from the hands of sentencing judges. Community groups demanded the establishment of civilian review boards and the removal of civil service protec-tions of police chiefs. Increasingly, citizens turned to private security arrange-ments to meet their desires for security. The criminal justice system, even as itbecame fairer and more professionally competent, was becoming increasinglyirrelevant to citizens' efforts to guarantee their own security and satisfy theirappetites for justice. The system's role in producing social justice seemed lessand less important. So the question that faces us now 30 years after the CrimeCommission's report is this: \"How can we restore the standing and effective-ness of the criminal justice system as a social institution that can both guaran-tee our safety and help us understand our obligations to one another in aconception of justice?\" The loss of popular legitimacy for the criminal justice system produces disas- trous consequences for the system's performance. If citizens do not trust thesystem, they will not use it. If citizens do not use the system, the expensiveapparatus we have constructed will be largely useless because the systemdepends fundamentally on citizen mobilization. Moreover, to the extent thatconfidence in the system is maldistributed, with poor minorities more suspi-cious of the system than the wealthier majority, the capacity of the system toact fairly is undermined, and with that, its future legitimacy, effectiveness, andcapacity to teach what we owe to one another. To the extent that the systemis viewed as inefficient or unjust, its ability to mobilize citizens to comply withlaws voluntarily will be undermined. Without popular legitimacy supportingcriminal justice operations, instead of having a collectively established crimi-nal justice system helping to enforce a widely shared conception of a just moralorder, we will live in a world of gated communities, each with its own concep-tion of right conduct, and each enthusiastically excluding citizens of othercommunities. To avoid this result, we must find a way to restore the popularlegitimacy of the Nation's criminal justice system.56The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices Legitimacy can be viewed as an abstract value, an ideal to be achieved. From this vantage point, what particular individuals and groups actually think aboutthe system and its operations is irrelevant. Of importance is the extent towhich the system can realize a particular set of values such as fairness orefficiency. Its success in doing so would be registered through technicalprofessional evaluations, not in popular sentiment. Alternatively, one canthink of legitimacy as something that exists in the minds of citizens . From this vantage point, legitimacy resides in people's views of the criminal justicesystem, not in performance or comparison to an ideal. From an operational and managerial perspective, the kind of legitimacy that is important, I would argue, is the second\u2014the kind that exists in the minds ofcitizens the system is supposed to serve. That may be very different from thefirst kind of legitimacy and may require different kinds of performance. Indeed,the big worry is that the ideals that many think should define legitimacy arenot embraced by ordinary citizens. In that case, of course, one would face astark choice between legitimating the system through political responsiveness(which threatens the ideals of justice), on one hand, and trying to make thesystem meet the ideal standards of efficiency and fairness, on the other.However, the fact is that many of the system's most important ideals are embraced by the populace. Citizens, too, like procedural fairness. They like asense of proportionality. They like efficiency and economy. And even if theydidn't like those things (which give us an enormous advantage), we as leadersand managers of criminal justice agencies would need to help citizens learn tolove them because, in the end, the system cannot operate without the supportof the citizenry for its fundamental values. This, then, is the problem to be addressed. How can we enhance the popular and moral legitimacy of the system while enhancing the legitimacy that comesfrom being technically proficient and aligned with important legal virtues suchas fairness and restraint.57Mark H . Moore My answer to this is simple: As managers of criminal justice agencies, we must pay attention to the quality of the interactions we have with citizens as clients , as overseers , and as coproducers of justice. In managing these interactions, we must stand for the important democratic values of fairness and restraint. Thisseems to be consistent with the challenge of establishing community justiceand using the Nation's criminal justice institutions to reweave the fabric ofcommunity. Let me explain why. Gary Abrecht, writing to America's corporate executives about how to improve the performance of their organizations, develops theidea that success lies in paying attention to the quality of what he calls \"mo-ments of truth\"\u2014the particular moments when customers encounter anorganization's operation and begin forming impressions about the companyand its product. From my point of view, labeling such mundane events as beingput \"on hold\" when one calls to order a product as a moment of truth seems alittle grandiose. But even in the commercial world, this grandiosity helps tofocus attention on the details of these all-important customer contacts. The \"moments of truth\" concept to me seems more appropriate when we are talking about the ways the Nation's criminal justice agencies might legitimatethemselves in the eyes of the citizens they serve. There really are importantmoments of truth\u2014i.e., when, as clients, citizens encounter the criminaljustice agencies asking for help or being obliged to stand still; when, as citizens,they contemplate the work of the criminal justice agency and decide whetherit is performing well or badly; and when, either as part of a community-basedpatrol or as a part of a jury, they are asked to participate in the production ofjustice. Those three moments of truth are what we have to pay attention to. The most obvious points of contact between citizens and criminal justice agencies consist of those moments when citizens call the system for help. Weimagine victims and witnesses calling the police for emergency aid or demand-ing justice from prosecutors. This is, of course, an important client group that58The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices criminal justice agencies must serve. If anyone is a \"retail customer\" of a criminal justice agency, it must be these individuals. And it doesn't take muchexperience in a radio patrol car or even in a prosecutor's office to learn thatmany citizens want things from criminal justice agencies other than theprosecution of criminal cases. We all know that citizens call the police formany things other than the response to serious crime. One of the most impor-tant ideas associated with community-oriented policing is to view thesenoncrime calls for services as worthy of response, rather than as distractingnuisances. The idea is that these calls may represent opportunities to interveneearly in situations that have become criminal matters. Or even if they are notthat, they may present an opportunity to establish a relationship with a citizenthat can become a \"bankable asset\" in the future. Similarly, prosecutors havefigured out that they must attend carefully to victims and witnesses to main-tain their cases through the long process of adjudication in felony cases, andthey must give close attention to less serious crimes adjudicated in misde-meanor courts. Agencies of the criminal justice system have important \"retail\" contacts with another group of clients as well: Those who become the focus of enforcementefforts. This group includes alleged criminal offenders, as well as those whohave been stopped for traffic offenses or asked to cooperate in some kind ofcrowd control. It has long been accepted that there is little chance of pleasingthese clients of the system and little prospect that they could become support-ers. Unlike the clients identified above who need help from criminal justiceagencies, these individuals are obligated to do something they did not chooseto do or are being punished for doing something they ought not to have done.As recipients of obligations and penalties rather than services, these clients areunlikely to be satisfied. In any case, it is doubtful that satisfying them shouldbe the goal of the enterprise. Consequently, with respect to these encounters,the only goal is to satisfy others that the encounter proceeded properly\u2014that there was in fact reasonable suspicion, that the stop was made in accord withthe law, or that a sentence was handed down without fear or favor.59Mark H . Moore More recently, however, this pessimistic view of how we ought to interact even with our \"obligatees\" has changed. Some believe that arrestees, defendants, andprisoners can tell the difference between being treated badly and well, fairly andunfairly, and that this difference ought to matter to those who manage criminaljustice agencies. There was a remarkable moment in my life about 10 years agoin New South Wales. We were talking about how to use surveys to measure thequality of police service that the New South Wales Police was delivering to thecitizens of Sydney. We talked about doing both a general population survey anda survey of those who called the police. Then someone in the group askedwhether we should survey arrestees. Everyone laughed, and conversation movedon to another topic. But about 10 minutes later one of the hardest-nosed cops inthe room said, \"You know, I've been thinking about that question of whether weshould survey arrestees. At first I thought it was really a dumb idea. But I've gotguys in my command who, no matter whom they arrest and under what circum-stances, the suspect comes into the station house bloody and mad. With otherguys, no matter whom they arrest, the suspect is clean and calm. I think thedifference matters. I'd like to know what arrestees experience as well as thepeople who call us.\" So, it may be important to try to satisfy those we obligate aswell as those we serve. After all, most of those we arrest, prosecute, and imprisonwill spend the bulk of their lives as citizens, not as arrestees, defendants, orinmates. And we may need their support as well as the support of those who arevictims and witnesses. It is also worth noting that citizens want things from criminal justice agencies both as groups and as discrete individuals. Particularly important are groups thatform around residential communities. Sometimes there are particular interestgroups that become important as well, such as small business associations orwomen who fear domestic violence or parents of teenagers who fear drugs andgangs. One can easily imagine that it might be important to think of such groupsas having \"accounts\" with criminal justice agencies and that it would be impor-tant for those who manage criminal justice agencies to attend to the characterand quality of the relationships they are maintaining through those accounts.60The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices From my perspective, what is important about these encounters with clients, both those receiving aid and those receiving obligations (and individuals aswell as groups), is that all such encounters leave a residue of experience andfeelings and that these in turn become the bases for enhanced or diminishedlegitimacy of the system. Citizens, like customers in commercial transactions,remember when they have been treated well and badly, and they respond withmore or less loyalty and interest. They may even come to identify and valuethe aims of those who treated them well and learn to suspect and despise theaims of those who treated them badly. Their interactions with the criminaljustice system are opportunities for communicating values as well as for build-ing support and legitimacy for criminal justice agencies. While the most intense moments of truth between citizens and criminal justice agencies may occur when citizens have discrete transactions with thesystem that involve their particular interests, the most common moments oftruth may be when citizens hear something about the performance of the system and form a view of whether it is performing well or badly. These are themoments when they interact with the system as overseers , not as clients or coproducers. The views of citizen overseers are important not only becausethey affect their willingness to support the criminal justice system with taxesand grants of authority, but also because their views about whether the systemis just may affect their willingness to obey the law. Citizens want to know thatthe system has written rules that are fair, that the laws are enforced fairly, thatthe system can respond to some important differences among individuals, andthat the whole system is designed to operate to good effect. The views of citizen overseers may be profoundly influenced by concrete experiences they have had as clients of the system. Citizen overseers may alsobase their views on the experience of their friends and family. For this reasonclient contacts are very important. When we were doing some work with theMollen Commission on controlling police corruption, I remember meeting andinterviewing one of the most corrupt and brutal cops that the Commission had61Mark H . Moore encountered. I interviewed him knowing that the New York City Police Department was working very hard to develop community policing andestablish better working relations with poor communities in New York. I hadthe sense that this one cop could single-handedly wipe out the day-to-daydiligent efforts of hundreds of officers trying to establish better working rela-tionships in communities. My heart sank as I realized how vulnerable theoverall legitimacy of the system was to the destructive influence of a relativelysmall number of bad encounters between officers and citizens. The point I want to make is that if we wish to engage citizens as effective overseers of criminal justice systems, it is important for us to find ways to makeour operations transparent and to present them in a comprehensive, consistent,and reliable way. Many in the criminal justice world have been reluctant to takeon such a responsibility for fear that their operations would become too exposedand too vulnerable to political interference. However, I think that a lot ofpeople have had the opposite experience: When they've made the effort toexpose and be open about their operations, they win support and enthusiasmfrom the citizens. This can then stand them in good stead on occasions whenthe system fails. It takes a certain amount of courage to decide to make one'sorganization's workings visible and accountable to citizens, but that openness iscrucial to getting the most from the particular moment of truth when a criminaljustice agency interacts with a citizen-overseer rather than a client. The third way that citizens make contacts with criminal justice agencies is through their important role as coproducers of justice. Victims and witnesses areimportant coproducers as well as clients and customers of the system, and theirefforts are essential to making the system work. (One can even imagine thatsome offenders are coproducers in the sense that they must work diligently ontheir own if rehabilitation is to succeed.) Here are some of the many other waysin which citizens can become coproducers: They serve on juries; they organizethemselves in block groups; or they serve in sentencing councils to providementoring to kids or to help monitor offenders released in communities. Indeed,62The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices families of offenders might turn out to be important allies in efforts to reduce future offending, and not only in juvenile cases. The notion of people in the communitiesas coproducers is being advanced currently by those concerned about communityjustice. People are inventing new ways to engage citizens in the concrete operationsof the system; in doing so, they not only increase the power and impact of the systembut also its standing with communities. These contacts with citizens as coproducers, if managed well, provide an opportunity to increase the legitimacy of the system. Each contact forms animpression; each contact provides an opportunity to express and advocate for aparticular set of values through the operations of the system. When the policearrest a suspect and read him his rights in front of victims and witnesses, whenprosecutors explain how a particular case will be handled and why, whendefense attorneys explain the case against their client, or when citizen-jurorsare given their instructions by a judge, certain lessons about the basic values ofthe criminal justice system are taught: Measured indignation about criminaloffending tempered by respect for the rights of citizens, the need to shareresponsibility in the exercise of social control, and the ambition to be fair. It isfrom this material that a constituency for justice and a criminal justice systemcan be constructed. Aristotle observed that the first virtue of a state was the quality of justice it could produce among its citizens. Justice has a large meaning in that idea:Right relationships among individuals and among individuals, society, and thestate. Within this broad notion of justice, right reactions to criminal offendingare only one small topic. But in many ways the handling of criminal justiceissues provides the most exacting test of justice, the hottest crucible, the placewhere our commitments and understanding to one another are tested mostseverely. An important base for all other interactions may be established basedon the quality we can produce in these particularly demanding relationships. Rightly understood, I believe it is the task of criminal justice agencies to take on the burden of producing quality justice in society's response to crime and63Mark H . Moore criminal offending. It falls to the Nation's criminal justice agencies to teach two of the hardest lessons that citizens in democracies must learn. The firstlesson is the most obvious: It is wrong to give offense to other citizens, thatone has to be restrained and respect other people's lives and properties. Thesecond lesson is far less obvious but potentially as important: Namely, it iswrong to take offense too easily or to respond to offense disproportionately.The second lesson requires of us that we be tolerant. In many ways it is muchmore difficult to be tolerant than to be offended when we are attacked. How-ever, by building a constituency for these values of neither giving offense nortaking offense easily, we increase the legitimacy of criminal justice institutionsand enhance their efficiency. We also accomplish the broader goal of reweav-ing the fabric of a liberal community\u2014\"liberal\" in the old-fashioned sense. Wecan come to understand what we most fundamentally owe to one another.After all, it is in the interstices of social interaction created by the restraint weimpose on ourselves and the wide latitude we give to others that the maximumof liberty and security is found. And it is this maximum we seek through thevarious initiatives of the community justice movement. If we are to producejustice, we must learn to love it and teach it. That is what the movement tocreate community justice is all about. Question-and-Answer Session Jenni Gainsborough, National Prison Project of the American Civil Liber-ties Union (ACLU), Washington, D.C.: I enjoyed everything that you said and agreed with it. The importance of establishing legitimacy is fundamentalto the criminal justice system. I wonder how you deal with two groups thatseem to me to be largely responsible for undermining legitimacy of the system:Politicians and the media. It seems to me that most people's contact with thesystem is not through the everyday meeting with the police officer, beingarrested, or any of the other things you talked about. What they know about64The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices crime is what they see on the 6-o'clock news and what their politician tells them. That certainly is completely contrasted to what you were saying abouttolerance and understanding of the necessity for justice. Is there anything wecan do at that level? M. M.: This has to do with how criminal justice agencies manage their relations with citizens as overseers, both through elected politicians and through the media.You and I could both do a very discouraging analysis. (Norval Morris will complainprobably about the way politicians have shamelessly exploited the crime issue forelectoral advantage and how inadequate the media coverage of crime and thecriminal justice system turns out to be with its emphasis on individual lurid casesand official misconduct, rather than trying to present to the citizens an accuratepicture of what happens in society.) I share your diagnosis. The question is, Do Ihave anything useful to say about what can be done to improve the quality ofthose interactions? I think the first idea is that one may be able to crash through some of the false impressions created by the media by doing a better job in all of the thousandsof individual encounters with citizens as clients and as coproducers. Instead oftrying directly to build a constituency for justice at the wholesale level throughthe media, it may be possible to do it at the retail level by trying to get peopleto understand and benefit from each individual transaction in the criminaljustice system. That would be statement number one. Statement number two would be that if the criminal justice system organizes itself to be responsive to groups as well as individuals, it might be able to findanother important point of contact between itself and the citizens\u2014a separatechannel of communication between its operations and citizens. That contactmay build support for the agency and establish a basis for communicatingappropriate values. So far, I'm arguing for the idea that we actually try to usethese encounters that occur between criminal justice agencies and citizens toget our message through the welter of noise and falseness that is out there.65Mark H . Moore I think many police organizations were quite startled to discover the success of the citizen academies. It turned out that if a police agency invited citizens tocome and ride in police cars and see what was going on, they responded withan enormous amount of intelligent interest and reason. I think a lot of otheragencies are beginning to take a lesson from that particular \"book.\" So my firstanswer is \"Don't do it at the wholesale level, do it at the retail level.\" The next statement is this: \"To the extent that you are going to do it at the wholesale level, I think it's very important for criminal justice agencies to takeleadership roles in getting their message out. I would advocate that policechiefs, corrections officials, chief justices, and others engage more actively inpolitical discussions about the purposes of the system and back up their ideasabout how the system ought to operate with relatively accurate and faithfulaccounting of what their organizations are doing. We might find an initialreluctance among citizens to have their public officials\u2014particularly officialsfrom criminal justice agencies\u2014being as prominent as I'm recommending, butthis might gradually yield to appreciation for the leadership that they canprovide. I think that the substantive values to which leaders of the criminal justice agencies commit themselves are very important. It is very tempting for leaders ofcriminal justice agencies, particularly police and corrections, to commit them-selves to what one might think of as technical, instrumental goals associatedwith reducing crime rather than justice goals that are associated with structuringrelationships properly throughout the society and delivering high-quality ser-vices to citizens. So I hope that the people who lead police and correctionalagencies will commit themselves to a set of values that is associated with theproduction of quality justice rather than with mere crime control. Jim Boden, Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the Presi- dent, Washington, D.C.: You talked a little bit about the decrease of the legiti-66The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices macy of the criminal justice system in recent years. Would you address briefly what effect the role of drug policies and our emphasis on drug control has had on that? M. M.: This is a good question. I think 2 or 3 weeks ago you had a speech from my colleague, Peter Reuter, on drug control policy. I'm in favor of laws againstcocaine and heroin use, and I'm perfectly willing to commit the authority andresources of the Nation's criminal justice system to trying to reduce the easyavailability of these drugs in our Nation's communities. Having said that, I want to acknowledge that this is a very, very expensive use of the criminal justice system in the sense that it chews up a great deal ofauthority and money as a means of preventing an increase in the rate of druguse and abuse. We have a particular responsibility in this area to use theauthority of the state, which I think of as a scarce and valuable commodity,with effect and fairly. I think we have been a bit indiscriminate in the way thatwe have used authority in the drug war. I don't want to eliminate our effortsaltogether, but I would like to see us make a more sustained effort to focus onthe places where it would do a lot of good and not cost us so much\u2014and wherewe can be relatively sure, not only in our eyes but in the eyes of the citizenry,that the laws are being brought to bear with effect and fairness. What I worryabout is that we have used authority a little too indiscriminately in drug policy. Ted Gest, U.S. News & World Report, Washington, D.C.: I won't use this forum to try to rebut the criticism of the news media, but I will ask a question totry to make some of your comments a little more specific. Referring to formerPolice Commissioner Bratton of New York, who essentially has expressed thethesis (you can rephrase it if I haven't expressed it correctly) that over the yearslaw enforcement got into a syndrome where it said, \"We can't do much aboutcrime so we won't try to take a leading role.\" How much of that do you agreewith, and how much would you apply that thesis (to the extent that you agreewith it) to the rest of the justice system? Are there any models that Mr. Brattonand his supporters have put out that might be appropriate for the courts, correc-67Mark H . Moore tions, etc., to try to be more aggressive in their roles in the justice system and in reducing crime? M. M.: Let me say a couple of things to that. First, I would be pretty satisfied with a criminal justice system that only delivered justice, and I would hope thatwhatever crime control benefits that I got from that happened as a residualeffect. In my view, the principal justification for the system lies in the quality ofthe justice we produced, rather than in the crime control effect. That's the firststatement I'd make. The second statement is that I believe (and spend a lot of my working life) in trying to help the criminal justice system achieve crime-reduction and fear-reduction effects as well as produce justice. I don't think I would have spent asmuch of my life on this subject if I didn't think that criminal justice agenciescould have a very important effect on levels of crime and fear in the society.So, yes, I do believe that criminal justice agencies can make an importantdifference, even in so difficult an area as drug abuse\u2014but perhaps equally inthe areas of crime control and fear reduction. I think that Commissioner Bratton's bold statement\u2014reacceptance of respon- sibility for controlling crime\u2014was a very important moment in leadership ofthe criminal justice system. I think it was quite a heroic individual stance\u2014one that exposed him and his agency to a real prospect of failure and ridicule.This bold commitment is what I like about it in some ways. It is an interestingexample of the way in which one can crash through the political debate atsome level. Bratton in some sense made himself and his organization transpar-ent. He nominated the terms in which he was prepared to be held accountableby the public. In doing that, he staked himself out (and with him the rest ofhis organization) on the accomplishment of that goal. I think the pressuresthat he unleashed actually helped him to run the organization and to increaseits performance and effectiveness.68The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices A lot of public-sector managers, and particularly criminal justice agency managers, don't really understand that accountability is their friend ratherthan their enemy. The only chance they have of focusing the attention of thelarge organizations they lead is to make themselves accountable and use thatattention to get improved performance. I think Bratton showed us a manage-rial style and stance as well as a particular set of programmatic activities thatcan plausibly be effective in controlling crime. Yes, I believe that the criminal justice system can control crime; I believe it should accept crime control as one of its important responsibilities. But Iwould add to the important responsibilities that it should accept the responsi-bility to guarantee the quality of justice and reduce fear as well. Third on thelist would be giving quality service to individuals as a way of legitimating allthe other responsibilities. Ruth Davis, The Pymatuning Group, Inc., Alexandria, Virginia: I've been impressed with the answers you have made to the questions. I'd like to getdown to what I call the street aspects of the criminal justice system. To me,the criminal justice system is a process\u2014it has an infrastructure and theattributes of an organization. When one is involved in it, leadership, salesman-ship, and management are needed. Most of what we talk about is leadershipand salesmanship. Management is the hard part; that's where one has to putthe product or service in the market. If one accepts the fact that managementnot only has requirements but it has some rights\u2014such as the ability to selectemployees (using the word loosely in this regard), the ability to decide whichservices can or should be provided, the ability to charge for those services, andthe ability to measure performance and to do something about it\u2014it's verydifficult for me to see what it is that we are allowing the management of thecriminal justice system to manage. It has the attributes of management in theschool system and everything else. We know a lot more about how to manageschools, but anything that has to do with the public\u2014the public makes itsown opinion\u2014is very difficult. I have difficulty seeing what we are providing69Mark H . Moore to the system that allows for good management, and what it is that we can really manage in the system as we see it today. M. M.: That is right up my alley. I like to think a lot about the successful management of criminal justice agencies. Three comments come to mind.First, my very first experience in managing a criminal justice agency wasworking for the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1974 and 1975 here inWashington. I remember testifying with my boss on the Hill at one stage, andone of the congressional representatives said to him, \"Mr. Bartels, how manypeople work for you?\" And he said, \"About half.\" It was a wonderful remark,got the same laugh there as he got here. But there was hell to pay when hewent back to the office. Jack Maples who worked with Bratton said to me, \"I have an enormous advan- tage over you in understanding how to manage criminal justice agencies. I knowsomething you don't know.\" I said, \"Well, what's that?\" And he said, \"Most copsdon't work most of the time.\" That was Maples' (not my) view. I take the pointthat there is a sense out there that officials in criminal justice agencies are notworking hard and are shielded by civil service and union protections. Let me say three things about the possibility of managing even in those circumstances. First, it is important to remember that the civil service andunion protections arose because of pretty sloppy and miserable managementin those agencies. It was perfectly appropriate for employees who were beingasked to do hard jobs or were being badly treated by their organizations to getboth civil service and union protections. So I don't begrudge them thatprotection\u2014I understand at least some of its sources. It has always been my view\u2014I realize it is an ideal view\u2014that authority is a crutch in management\u2014the thing that bad managers rather than good managers use. Goodmanagers (like good cops) are people who learn how to accomplish things withminimum use of authority. So one hardly even notices that they are in positions ofauthority. Everything seems so right or it seems so inevitable that things be done this70The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices way that one just goes ahead and does it. And the mailed fist of real authority never has to be shown. What I'm saying is that managers are \"copping out\" when they say,\"We can't get the job done because we don't have authority.\" Having said all that, let me make the last statement, which I think is impor- tant in relation to the point I was making earlier about Bratton. I've spent 25years of my life not only doing criminal justice stuff, but also studying public-sector management. In school, I learned, like everybody else, that the impor-tant and powerful instruments of management were things like organizationalstructure, human resource policies, management information systems, andcontrol systems. I learned a lot about those things. What I gradually came torealize, however, is that those things weren't worth a damn without a powerfulexternal pressure. All those things could do was distribute voltage through anorganizational system. What made an organizational system run was a voltagegenerator that existed someplace else. In the world of private-sector manage-ment, that voltage generator is the desire for survival, to find a market nicheand beat the competition and to supply goods and services that consumerswant. That desire turns out to produce a lot of voltage going through organiza-tions, which the managers can then effectively deploy, getting the people towork without having to use authority. In the public sector, what is the analog? My only answer to that is that I think political accountability is to the public sector what customer accountabilityand competition are to private-sector organizations. If I had to choose betweentrying to fix a public-sector organization by fixing its internal control systems,on the one hand, or making it accountable to a powerful outside body that isinsistently demanding a change, on the other, I would pick the second everytime. In fact, the second is so much more powerful, that if I found myselfrunning an organization that was going in direction A and there wasn't anypressure forcing it to go back in direction B (which I thought was the rightdirection), I'd probably work hard to build an outside pressure to move ittoward direction B. That would be a more effective way of getting the job71Mark H . Moore done than trying to fix the internal system. The reason is that without that outside pressure, when I go to ask my troops to do something different, theylook past me and say, \"Why?\" Let me make this very concrete. This was a hard lesson for me. I was working with the Philadelphia Police Task Force. We were doing a review of thePhiladelphia Police Department in the aftermath of two terrible events. Onewas the MOVE investigation, in which the police had dropped a smoke bombon a house to roust a radical group and the bomb caught on fire and destroyeda city block. About 20 people were killed. The other was a corruption scandalthat reached just below the commissioner level inside the organization. Youmight have thought that this organization would be on its knees with this kindof dramatic performance failure. So we were trying to fix the police depart-ment and work out a basis on which it could reconstitute itself. We sent out a survey to the citizens of Philadelphia and asked them the follow- ing question (fully expecting the survey to come back and tell us that the policedepartment was bad, which would give us leverage for making importantchanges): \"On a scale of one to five, what do you think of the PhiladelphiaPolice Department?\" It came back about 4.5. Pretty good, right? Teachingratings I'd be glad to have. Then it asked a whole series of discrete questions:\"Do you think the cops are rude?\" [Oh yeah, terrible, awful.] \"Do you think theysleep on the job?\" [Yeah, sure. We see them sleeping on the job all the time.]\"Do you think they take bribes?\" [Yes\u2014a lot of people thought they did.] \"Doyou think they sexually harass defendants?\" [One-third of the people thought thecops did that often.] And yet, they rated the department at 4.5! I was discussing these results with a room full of captains from the Philadelphia Police Department, and they were all kind of looking down at their shoes,embarrassed that I didn't understand. Finally, one guy was goaded beyondendurance by my ignorance. He looked up at me and he said, \"Look, Doc, yougotta understand; when you're shoveling shit, you gotta be indulged a little72The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices bit.\" People in the room relaxed a little, and everyone sort of agreed. This was his understanding\u2014and that of everyone in the room\u2014of the relationship theagency had to the citizens of Philadelphia. And what's more, the citizens ofPhiladelphia agreed. I suddenly understood. That deal that had been struckbetween the citizens of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Police Departmentcould have been struck (maybe had been struck) in cities throughout the country. Now if the above is true, there is no leverage for change in that police depart- ment. And the only way that the leverage can come for changing the policedepartment is to have somebody step forward and say, \"How about this as analternative deal?\" When that person steps forward and asks that, it will workonly if he or she is met with a resounding chorus that says, \"Yeah, we likethat!\" That chorus had better come from outside the department as well asinside the department, or nothing is going to happen. That's the momentwhen the opportunity for leadership is there. Bill Burnham, Visiting Fellow, National Institute of Justice, U.S. Depart- ment of Justice, Washington, D.C.: To encourage you a little, a story first about my former employer: When I was in a group saying how many peopleworked for the Secretary General of the United Nations, the answer was 10percent. So you're batting pretty well! A point in your main presentation that wasn't picked up was the enormous amount of damage a few bad individuals in a system can do. Would you thereforeagree that any effort and any investment of resources by senior management onfinding such people is, in the long run, one of the best uses of resources? (I speakas a former member of the British Prison Service.) M. M.: Yes; I believe it's important to focus attention on people who are persistent and dangerous offenders both in the citizen population and in ourown organizations. I think it's terribly important to be able to root them out.We could go on at great length about controlling corruption in criminal justiceagencies, which is a subject of great interest to me.73Mark H . Moore As you know, there is an image out there that there are a few \"rotten apples in the barrel\" and that we need to control them. The other notion is that there isa system of corruption that supports not only those few bad apples at the tail ofthe distribution, but also the large number of people interior to the right tail ofthe distribution, but still pretty bad actors. You either hear the story that, \"Wego after the people at the right tail (rotten apple theory)\" or \"We go after theaverage performance of the organization (the cultural change model).\" I think it is almost silly to have that debate because I think the answer is that you have to do both of those things simultaneously. Each one helps to rein-force the other. I think it is very dangerous to concentrate exclusively on thebad guys, because when they get taken out of the system the rest of the organi-zation doesn't quite understand why. That is, they will react against theauthority. You can be running a class as a teacher, and there may be somebodyin the class who is driving everybody else in the class wild by talking too muchand being a jerk. You will let this go on for a long time hoping that the classwill discipline the miscreant, but the class won't do it. Then one day youthink, \"I'll be a hero as a teacher and discipline this student so that the otherstudents can benefit.\" Right? I'm always astonished that, in the next 5 seconds,that first student has become everybody's best friend, and you've become thebiggest jerk in the world. I think that this is a rather common thing thathappens inside organizations. The organization will routinely close ranksaround people who have been singled out for misconduct if one hasn't built anorganizational climate in which the authority is allied with the people in theorganization and a cultural commitment has been made. That conduct issomething no one wants inside their organization. Again, making that point more concrete and with more evidence from within policing (rather than from the weird world of academia): Patrick Murphy,when he was talking about dealing with police corruption in New York Cityalways told a wonderful story. Murphy, as you know, had developed a system.He rejected the advice to concentrate on controlling corruption by setting up a74Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence powerful Internal Affairs Department (IAD) that would investigate the worst offenders. Instead, he used the centralized IAD as a general staff operation to monitor\"ambient levels\" of corruption in a precinct. These reports would then be used as abasis for discussion with the precinct commanders on what they were doing tocontrol corruption. He gave the resources for controlling the corruption to thedecentralized precinct commanders rather than leaving it sequestered in IAD. When asked why it was that he did that, he would give a very eloquent speech. He said, \"Well, in the old days in the New York City Police Department therewould be some corrupt cops, and the people from IAD would come down, walkinto the precinct house, put handcuffs on the officers, and lead them away.Right after they led them away, the precinct captain would get all the troopstogether in the precinct (because morale was now slipping), and the precinctcommander would say, 'Those bastards from downtown just took Joe andWillie, two of the finest cops I've ever known.' \" In that moment, the culturethat was supportive of corruption was being advantaged. Authority was align-ing itself with the support of corruption and marginalizing the effort at corrup-tion control. Murphy said he wasn't going to stand for that. He was going tomake the precinct captain put the cuffs on the corrupt cops. As soon as Murphy's program was in place inside the New York City Police Department, things changed fast. The reason they changed fast is that the peopleat the captain level, who couldn't find it in their stomach to control corruption,left. And that made room for people who thought \"thank God, somebody hasfinally seen the value of someone like me who is hostile to corruption,\" and thosepeople began coming up through the ranks and taking the captain positions. Onceyou have 70 captains focusing on this problem rather than a few people in IADtrying to make investigations against a \"wall of silence,\" you've got a lot moresocial control inside the department than you had before. So, you don't always want to go just after the bad guys; you want to go after the supporting infrastructure as well.The Legitimation of Criminal Justice Policies and Practices75Cathy Spatz Widom Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities forBreaking the Cycle of Violence Presentation by Cathy Spatz Widom, Ph.D. University of New York at Albany April 8, 1997 Washington, D.C. We have all read newspaper reports about the deaths of young children due to child abuse or neglect: Lisa Steinberg, Jessica Cortez, Emily Hernandez, Joey Wallace,Nadine Lockwood, and most recently, Elisa Izquierdo. Butwhat happens to the children who survive? The babiesabandoned on streets or in hospitals, children left unattendedfor days without food in filthy roach-infested apartments, orchildren brutally abused. These children may not be wellknown. Indeed in New York City, no one in the city's childwelfare administration or the school system noticed thedisappearance of 8-year-old Justina Morales for 15 months,although she was known to child welfare officials. As we nowknow, Justina Morales was murdered in December 1995 andher body disposed of in a trash can. 176Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence The names of these children appear in distressing newspaper stories like the case of 16-year-old David Newbury and Mark Rea in Milwaukee, who sexuallyassaulted and clubbed to death a classmate. David's court record revealeda childhood history of beatings, cruel words, and indifference. Before beingsentenced to life in prison, David told a probation officer, \"I lived like I was treated.\" 2 Today, I have three goals: to briefly describe how childhood victimization andviolent criminal behavior are related, to illustrate promising strategies andopportunities to intervene, and to suggest some important principles to guideinterventions prior to formulating or proposing new policy. This talk is anattempt to bridge the world of research with that of policy. You should knowthat I do not pretend to be exhaustive here in describing programs, but ratherto illustrate with a few examples. Over 10 years ago, as Jeremy Travis mentioned, with initial funding from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), I began research to address the relationship between early childhood abuse and neglect and later delinquent and violent criminal behavior. This is a study of 1,575 children from a metropolitan area in the Midwest who were followed for a 25-year period after the abuse or neglectincident. These were substantiated cases of physical and sexual abuse andneglect, which occurred early in the lives of these children (before age 12). 3 Using official criminal records of arrests, we found that childhood victimiza-tion increases the likelihood of delinquency, adult criminality, and violentcriminal behavior. At the same time, however, we found that the relationshipis not inevitable, suggesting an opportunity for long-range violence preventionthrough appropriate intervention. I want to call your attention briefly to five major points. 4 First, the risk of arrest: Childhood victimization clearly increases a person's risk of arrest. To place this in perspective, the odds are almost two times higherthat an abused or neglected child will be arrested as a juvenile for a violentcrime than a control group child.77Cathy Spatz Widom Our research was conducted in a metropolitan county area in the Midwest, using court cases from the years 1967 to 1971. But others have found similarresults. In New York, for example, as part of the Rochester Youth Develop-ment study, Thornberry and his colleagues collected information on childabuse and neglect for the children who were part of their study. 5 They also found that child maltreatment was a significant risk factor for delinquency.Similarly, another evaluation by Matt Zingraff and his colleagues, usingmaltreated children and two nonmaltreated comparison samples from anothergeographic area of the country, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, foundthat maltreated children had higher rates of delinquency as well. 6 Thus, in three quite different prospective studies from different parts of the countryusing cases from different time periods, childhood abuse and neglect have beenfound to increase a person's risk of delinquency. Second, we have also learned that abused and neglected children are arrested at an earlier age, have more arrests, and are more likely to be repeat violent offend-ers. 7 Abused and neglected children are involved in criminal behavior almost a year earlier than the control group children. This is important because we knowthat age of onset is often negatively correlated with the severity of the disorder. 8 Third, there is a cycle of violence. And violence does beget violence. That is,being physically abused as a child leads to an increased risk of an arrest forviolence. However, our findings indicate that being neglected as a child alsoincreases the risk of arrest for violence. I'll come back to this. Fourth, there are differential patterns for population subgroups. Childhood victimization seems to have pervasive consequences for criminal behavior andviolence in some respects, that is, it affects females as well as males\u2014and as youknow, females are at low risk for being arrested, particularly for being arrested fora violent crime. On the other hand, there seems to be a differential impact ofchildhood victimization on the criminal consequences for African-Americanchildren as compared with white children. 9 This we do not yet understand.78Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence Fifth and finally, other findings suggest that childhood victimization also has the potential to affect other domains of functioning. We've conducted in-person followup interviews with a subset of the original sample (work sup-ported by the National Institute of Justice, the National Institute on AlcoholAbuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), the National Institute of Mental Health(NIMH), and now the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)). 10 We have found that abused and neglected children are also likely to manifest cognitiveand intellectual deficiencies; 11 mental health consequences including antiso- cial personality disorder,12 posttraumatic stress disorder,13 and higher rates of suicide attempts;14 alcohol abuse for women;15 unemployment; and lower rates of marital stability.16 These outcomes reported so far most likely represent only the tip of the iceberg of areas potentially affected in a negative way by child-hood victimization. Enough of the bad news. The good news is that there is an emerging \"science of prevention\" 17 and that there are some programs that have been shown to be effective. For the most part, our current system of interventions is highly reactive in nature, geared toward treatment, rather than proactive with preventive effortsaimed at reducing vulnerability and risk. In the case of child victims, thejustice system gets the failures of other systems. By the time these children aretreated or seen, it is often after referral by court personnel, when they aretypically manifesting a long history of antisocial behavior. However, at numerous points in a child's life and environment there are opportunities to intervene. This is particularly true for abused and neglectedchildren and especially those who come to the attention of public officials. 18 I have selected a typical case to illustrate such opportunities for intervention. This is the case of a male child who was brought to the attention of the courts through a neglect petition when he was 6 years old. His mother was unem-ployed and his father's whereabouts was unknown at the time. He had eight79Cathy Spatz Widom siblings, born during an 8-year time period. He was the fifth child. For some time before the neglect petition, he had been cared for by his maternal grand-father. By the time of his petition, he had been abandoned for some years. Atthe age of 7, he was made a ward of the county. During this time, his mothershowed only sporadic interest in him, and indeed, many of the other childrenin the family were cared for by other people scattered throughout the city.Eventually, some of the other siblings were adopted. At age 9, he was pickedup by the police for running away on two separate occasions. He was heldovernight, and the incident was recorded. Then, he was sent to a foster home.During this time, his mother would take him away from the foster home, takehim out of school, and return him to the foster mother with only the clotheson his back. At that time, the public school system referred him to theChildren's Bureau because of the constant disruption of his school attendancedue to his mother's moving from place to place. At age 12 and again at age 13he was picked up and charged with being ungovernable. The first time, he wassent to a group home for a short stay. The second time, he was placed onprobation. By age 20 he was well on his way to becoming a repeat violentoffender. By age 32 he had 13 separate arrests for violence, and by all accountshe might be considered a dysfunctional young adult. By that time he had spentseveral years in correctional facilities. What promising strategies or programs might have made a difference in his life? Before his birth, home visitors might have worked with his mother toimprove her parenting skills through public health and family support systemservices. Home visitation is one type of program that involves several models.Some rely on public health nurses who establish contact with mothers duringtheir pregnancy and provide frequent visits after birth, whereas others rely onparaprofessionals who meet with the mother after discharge from the hospital.One reason for using home visitation is to reach families who might nototherwise have access to services, such as rural families living in isolated areas,urban poor isolated families, or families who might be unwilling to travel toservice providers, such as abusive or neglectful families.80Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence Another advantage of the home visitation program is that, after having developed a relationship with the parent, home visitors can provide services and models foreffective parenting. One program, developed by David Olds and his colleagues, 19 uses prenatal and infancy home visitation by nurses to prevent a wide range ofhealth and development problems, including prevention of child abuse. Theprogram was based on the premise that nurse home visitors were in an optimalposition to identify and help change factors in the family environment thatinterfere with maternal health habits, infant caregiving, and parental personalaccomplishment in the areas of work, education, and family planning. Thisintervention was assessed through a randomized trial with 400 first-time high-riskmothers. Compared with families without these services, home-visited clients had fewer low-birth-weight babies, fewer reported cases of child abuse and neglect,higher rates of child immunizations, and more age-appropriate child development. Now our young man also might have been enrolled in a program for pre- schoolers at risk for impairment of intellectual functioning and eventualschool failure, such as the Perry preschool project. 20 In this project, low- income, black, 3- and 4-year-olds were randomly assigned to preschool andcontrol conditions. Children in the experimental group attended high-quality,cognitively oriented early childhood education for 1 to 2 academic years.Teachers made weekly home visits, and monthly parent meetings were held.Longitudinal followup data to age 19 indicate that the Perry preschool chil-dren showed lower rates of placement in special education classes, lower graderetention, better performance on standardized measures of achievement, betterhigh school graduation rates, and lower rates of welfare assistance than thechildren with no preschool. Further followup at approximately age 27 showedthat the preschool program had dramatically reduced the rate of arrests andchronic offending. 21 Another opportunity that we missed for our young man was when the publicschool system, recognizing this child's inschool problems, complained aboutthe disruptive influence of the child's mother. Truancy has been increasingly81Cathy Spatz Widom recognized as a major problem in our country. A number of communities have begun to design truancy-reduction programs that often involve schools, lawenforcement, families, businesses, judicial and social service agencies, andcommunity and youth service organizations. Such programs involve intensivemonitoring, counseling, and other family-strengthening services that areoffered to truants and their families. And in these cases, there is at leastpreliminary evidence to suggest that these programs may be effective. 22 Although too late for our young man, a series of community-based interven-tions with children and adolescents, aimed at violence prevention, was initi-ated in 1992 at various sites across the country. 23 Now, these programs are not designed to intervene with abused and neglected children, yet we hope thatthe information obtained from the evaluations of these promising interven-tions will be helpful. But for all of these promising strategies (and others not mentioned), we will need to use caution in moving from small pilot tests such as these to large-scaleprevention trials. It is very tempting to generalize from programs that haveshown promising results. However, it is very important to resist the temptationsince there may be features of experimental projects that are difficult or evenimpossible to reproduce in a large-scale social program. What have we learned from these promising strategies or interventions to help guide the development of further programs to break the cycle of violence? I'dlike to mention six principles very briefly: 1. The earlier the intervention, the better. Interventions need to be insti- tuted early\u2014before the behaviors have stabilized and become less amenable tochange. 24 Early childhood is a period during which the central nervous system is changing rapidly and profoundly and the attitudes and habits of children areformed. 25 Without interventions, deficits or dysfunctional behaviors at one age lay the groundwork for subsequent dysfunctional behaviors.26 For example,82Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence severe malnutrition in infancy or brain damage from physical abuse may lead to impaired cognitive and intellectual functioning, which in turn affects IQand obviously affects school performance, which in turn affects that child'sability to function adequately as an adolescent and young adult. Servicesshould begin early, preferably during the prenatal period or shortly after birth,and should extend through the early years of a child's life. Early interventionsshould focus on eliminating factors that decrease a child's capacity for normalcognitive and neurological maturation. Aiming early intervention efforts atchildhood victims has the potential to influence their behavior before theirfirst offense. This is not to say that all childhood victims should automatically become suspects. But given the increased risks associated with early childhood victim-ization, police, teachers, and health workers need to recognize the signs ofabuse and neglect and take action to intervene early. Later interventionshould not be ignored, but later i nterventions are more labor intensive and more difficult since they must deal simultaneously with the existence of problem behav-iors and the prevention of further additional problem behaviors. If earlier identifi-cation of abuse and neglect leads to positive interventions then this should reducethe risk of future violent behavior. 2. Don't neglect neglected children. Increased attention needs to be paid to neglected children. Although neglect cases have not received as much atten-tion as cases of physical or sexual abuse, some researchers have suggested thatchildren who experience neglect may be as vulnerable to long-term problemsand to dysfunctional behavior as are victims of physical or sexual abuse. 27 Our research demonstrated a clear link between neglect and later violent criminalbehavior. These findings are of particular concern since the incidence of neglectis more than twice that of physical abuse, and neglect cases represent themajority of the cases taxing the child protection system. In contrast to theepisodic and explosive nature of physical abuse, neglect is a chronic conditionwhich, in some ways, may be more amenable to intervention strategies.83Cathy Spatz Widom Few justice programs address the needs of neglected children. The dispropor- tionate number of these cases has at least two consequences for public officials:First, they will be called upon to deal with more cases of abuse and neglect,and second, since childhood victimization in the form of neglect is linked tolater criminal behavior, a larger share of tomorrow's offenders will be today'svictims of neglect. 3. One size does not fit all. It is also important to recognize that one size does not fit all, for families or children. What works for one child in one contextmay not work for a different child in the same setting, the same child inanother setting, or the same child in another period in his or her development.Characteristics of the child will influence the extent to which interventionsmay be effective. For example, temperament exacerbates in some cases orminimizes in other cases a child's level of risk to develop problem behavior. 28 We have found that there is a small group of children, less than 7 percent,within the larger group of abused and neglected children in our sample whohave indications of severe behavior problems at an early age. 29 These children with behavior problems made more placement moves than children withoutsuch indication. And these children with behavior problems are seven timesmore likely to be arrested as a juvenile and four times more likely to be arrestedfor a violent crime than children without those indications. Now, whetherfrequent moves reflect an early predisposition of the child to antisocial behavioror whether they reflect a response to it, children with numerous placements arein need of special services and are not well served by routine responses. Ratherthan waiting until after multiple placement failures, better identification of thesechildren prior to placement would permit assignment to specialized treatmentprograms based on an assessment of the child's needs, which includes taking intoconsideration the child's developmental status at the time. To be effective, interventions need also to recognize that children do not develop in a vacuum but, rather, in a social context. Characteristics of parentsor caretakers and of the neighborhood and the community in which the child84Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence lives also exert potent influences on the child's development. While the first important influence on the child is the family, children and families areinteracting members of a larger social system including schools and communities.There is growing evidence that the long-term impact of childhood trauma,whether it is direct victimization as in child abuse and neglect or witnessingviolence in one's family or community, may depend on characteristics orpractices of the family or the community in which the child lives. 30 This takes me to the next point. 4. Surveillance is a double-edged sword. One advantage of home visitation programs is that they can provide a watchful eye in the home. Unusual bruises,signs of spousal abuse, or indications of drug abuse can be noted by an indi-vidual with a trained eye. Similarly, an advantage of better training for policeofficers and school teachers to identify child abuse and neglect is the potentialfor the provision of services to these children and their families. On the otherhand, surveillance is a double-edged sword associated with potentially seriousnegative consequences, particularly when some segments of the population areat risk for different levels of surveillance. Families who, because of certaindemographic characteristics such as poverty, unemployment, or single parent-hood, have frequent contact with public service agencies are more oftenexposed to closer scrutiny. Special care needs to be taken, then, in respondingto and handling cases of childhood victims to prevent damage from thedestructive edge of the double-edged sword. Our differential findings regardingthe long-term criminal consequences of abuse and neglect by ethnicity cannotbe ignored. If there are differences in the community's or system's response toabused and neglected children as a function of differences in ethnic or racialbackgrounds, then it is important to identify these differences, particularly ifthey relate to subsequent levels of violence in these children. At a minimum,intervention agents need to be sensitive to the possibilities of differentialtreatment on the basis of race or ethnic background and take steps to avoidsuch practices.85Cathy Spatz Widom 5. Interventions are not one-time efforts. Many intervention efforts involve a single dose of relatively short duration. However, we have learned that pro-grams such as home visitation, the Perry preschool, and Head Start cannot beviewed as a \"single shot in the arm\" or a one-time inoculation procedure.Rather, may require shots\" and perhaps morelong-term followup. The original Elmira study, continued through the child'ssecond birthday, was associated with definite benefits. 31, 32 However, the effects disappeared when the children were reevaluated at 25 and 50 months of age.33 Perhaps we need to view early childhood intervention programs in the sameway that we view other services to children, such as fluoride treatments. Theymay need to be continued with varying intensities at various points in child-hood and adolescence. 6. Resources should be accessible. It is not enough just to increase resources, because accessibility is as important as the resources themselves. Concretebarriers\u2014such as transportation, language problems, and fragmented services\u2014may prevent children at risk or their families from taking advantage ofexisting resources. But barriers can be psychological as well. According to oneresearcher, 34 schools that provide free meals for low-income children have found that these children will not eat the meals if other children or teachersknow they are free. Max Frankel, 35 in a column entitled, \"Less Medicare, More Magic,\" argued to preserve the universality of social security to avoid thestigmatization of the elderly poor. Likewise, the potential for stigma associatedwith early child and parent intervention programs would be minimized byuniversal coverage. Abusive and neglectful families may be more likely toaccept parenting and child intervention programs that are offered to all in thecommunity rather than targeted ones that might embarrass or stigmatize. Thismay be particularly important for intrusive interventions in family life, such ashome visitation programs. Programs offered to all children and all familieswould also avoid implications of discrimination as well. Service providerscould determine the intensity of services required depending on the particularneeds of the child, the particular family, and the resources of the community.86Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence So, what do I conclude? Comprehensive parent and early childhood inter- vention programs are clearly the option of choice. Estimates of the cost ofhome visiting for 1 year are between $1,500 to $3,500 per family. Considerthat the total number of newborns born in Washington, D.C., in 1992 was10,960. 36 If early parent and child intervention services were provided to all mothers of newborns in the District, the total cost per year would be roughly$38.3 million, using the higher cost estimate. Assuming that such a programwere to begin in 1998 and continue for 5 years, at the end of that time wewould expect that the entering kindergarten class in the District in the fall of2003 would show dramatically improved health and academic preparedness.Even though $38.3 million per year sounds like a lot for a social experiment,such a program would probably pay for itself. At least in the original Elmiraproject, the cost of this early prevention project for high-risk families wasequivalent to government savings associated with lower utilization of Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children, food stamps, Medicaid, child protectionservices, as well as tax revenues due to maternal employment. 37 Furthermore, these cost savings do not take into account the costs associated with servicesfor older children and adolescents involving special education, foster care,court expenses, and juvenile detention and incarceration. 38 John Leventhal,39 a pediatrician at Yale, has suggested that home visiting for high-risk newbornsand their families might be covered by medical insurance or managed careplans similar to the cost of medical care. He cites one report that estimated thetotal costs for each form of transplant\u2014kidney, bone marrow, or liver\u2014in theUnited States to be about $1 billion per year. 40 Home visiting, which clearly has the same potential to be lifesaving for some children and to improvemarkedly the development of many others, is relatively inexpensive per familycompared with transplantation. Leventhal suggests that in the course of achild's lifetime, a successful preventive service should be viewed as a modestinvestment to ensure that the child's first few years of life are spent in a safeand nurturing environment. 4187Cathy Spatz Widom Universal parent and child intervention programs beginning during preg- nancy are clearly preferable. However, if policymakers are not persuaded bythe substantial benefits likely to come from the kinds of interventionefforts suggested here, then the criminal justice literature indicates thatinterventions targeted at abused and neglected children at a minimum arecritical since these children clearly are at high risk for hurting themselvesand hurting others. Problems with attempts to predict future delinquency or adult offending often complicate proposals for early intervention. The situation for victimsof child abuse and neglect is different. Abuse and neglect cases are those inwhich a decision to intervene has already been made and where publicofficials are already involved. Nonetheless, one important unresolved issuefor me is whether targeted intervention strategies can be developed thatprotect the privacy of the children and their families and guard against thepotentially negative outcomes associated with increased surveillance. I have two simple take-home messages. First, there are promising programs that we should evaluate and build upon. Second, children are able tochange given the chance and a little help. Not all abused and neglectedchildren grow up to become violent offenders. And while we do not yetfully understand the factors that make the difference in their lives, we needto intervene early\u2014and the earlier, the better. This is consistent withother social goals: reducing crime, increasing educational achievement,and preventive health care. The cycle of violence hypothesis proposes thatyesterday's and today's childhood victims will become tomorrow's offendersand perpetrators of violence. Rather than focusing on responses to childabuse or neglect in court proceedings that \"treat\" offenders, preventionefforts should target childhood victims to reduce their risk of becomingoffenders in the future.88Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence Question-and-Answer Session Duane Ragan, Office for Victims of Crime, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.: Did you include any of the children who had been in Head Start? C.S.W.: I did not include Head Start evaluations in this talk, but certainly some of the children not in the Perry preschool program would have been inHead Start. I know there is controversy about the long-term effects of HeadStart, but in some of the work that I've seen, the effects have been quitepowerful. I didn't include them here because I simply didn't have the most up-to-date followups. Also, I really wanted to tie in the connection to the crimi-nal justice community, the issue of reduced arrests and chronic offending. Christopher Stone, Vera Institute of Justice, New York, New York: Do you know if there are any child welfare agencies in the country that have heldthemselves or are held accountable/responsible for the future development ofthe kids who are currently their wards? C.S.W.: Remember, I'm a researcher; I don't work in child welfare. There are child welfare people here. Certainly, Nicholas Scoppetta in New York City nowis trying to take a position, saying that \"I'm going to be held accountable forthis.\" I suspect that there are people who are doing that. Whether they aretaking as public a stance as Scoppetta, I don't know. He is certainly getting heat. Nicholas Scoppetta, Administration for Children's Services, New York, New York: The question was directed more toward holding us accountable for the future consequences of abuse and neglect. What I've been talking about isholding the system accountable for delivering what we are supposed to bedoing, not simply the nobility of our intentions.89Cathy Spatz Widom C.S.W.: Well, you see, I think that, if you don't have the kinds of slippages that you are having in the agency, if you are able to accomplish what youwould like to do and do it early enough in the process when you have thesedefinite cases of child abuse and neglect, you will see a reduction of problemsin the future. So, if you will be held accountable for dealing properly andresponsibly with those kids, then I think the rest will fall into place. Edward Cotton, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Springfield, Illinois: I wondered whether, in the early intervention programs, particularly some of the models that are used nationally, you looked at strate-gies to use with dropouts. Since these programs are voluntary, the ones welooked at had extremely high dropout rates\u2014whether at-risk families wereidentified in the hospital and said \"no\" or said \"yes\" and were never availableafter that. I guess I want to put things in perspective. These programs arevoluntary, the dropout rate seems to be very high, and I wondered if you coulddiscuss any strategies to address that. Because it doesn't matter if a program isgreat if people are not going to come to it or if they drop out of it. C.S.W.: That's a good question. One of the things that I cut out of my presen- tation (but is in the paper) is a talk about some of these barriers. A womannamed Karol Kumpfer 42 has done some work on parent-training programs that I think is creative. One thing that she has been able to do is to get very highparental attendance rates at her program meetings. One way she has done thatis by really paying attention to some of the nitty-gritty issues like transporta-tion, daycare, and all these other things that will actually enable parents toattend. That doesn't get at your issue, which is parents who simply don't wantto or are not themselves \"together\" enough. I think (this is the caution thatyou heard here in this talk) we need to solve\u2014we need to do some preliminarywork to figure out what is the best way to get parents to enroll, to commit tobeing in these programs, and then to be kept involved in these programs.Because, clearly, if only a very small fraction of the families who are offeredthese services are taking the services, most likely those avoiding them are90Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence going to be the families who are most in need of the services (the most dys- functional). Before we plunge into major programming\u2014I guess I shouldn'thave said 1998, then, for the newborns in the District\u2014I think we need somepreliminary work to deal with these very practical issues. But I don't know, otherthan Kumpfer's work, whether there is other literature that talks about that. Donald Murray, National Association of Counties, Washington, D.C.: Dr. Widom, I was very interested in your highlighting the problems of accessibilityto services. In so many of our communities we see a lot of fragmentation wherethe community doesn't have a strategy. In terms of holding the communityaccountable, making sure all the players are at the table, we're excited by whatGovernor Hunt in North Carolina is doing. I'm sure you've heard about it. Atthe county level, half the counties in the State (shooting for the whole State)have set up boards just to focus on children 0-to-3 years of age. He has put in alittle less than $100 million, but so far the results have been spectacular. C.S.W.: I certainly hope that someone is evaluating from when the program began to 5 years from now, so we can learn what were the good things thatwere done\u2014what were the things that made a difference\u2014so we can then takethem to another community. Donald Murray, National Association of Counties, Washington, D.C.: The central thing is getting the community to come up with a collaborative strat-egy based on the thinking of all segments of the community. That's usually notdone. It's just a very simple idea. David Lloyd, Family Advocacy Program, U.S. Department of Defense, Arlington, Virginia: I'm afraid that you picked a poor example: A child that's the fifth of eight children with umpteen different fathers already is in a familythat is probably not going to be one that participates in any type of voluntaryearly intervention program. It kind of reminds me of Richard Gelles's call forremoving those children from their families permanently, thinking about91Cathy Spatz Widom terminating parental rights early, and moving them into adoption (with the caveat of ensuring that they receive the treatment services to deal with whathas already happened to them). Too many of those children do not receivethis either in foster families or in adopted families. But my larger concern has to do with the conflict that we have in child welfare philosophy. The good news, I guess, is that child abuse and neglect is a low base-rate phenomenon. Even if we double or triple the estimates of how frequently itoccurs, it is still a relatively (thank goodness) infrequent phenomenon. Com-bined with that, we have kind of unitary terms to describe very discrete thingshappening. Neglect is not a unitary phenomenon. There are children neglectedfor their medical needs, which tend to be rather one-time-only issues. There arechildren whose educational needs have been neglected, and it is difficult todifferentiate these children from truants when they hit a certain age level. Thenthere is neglect that is clearly poverty related; this probably should not beconsidered parental neglect but rather economic neglect or American societyneglect. Then there is parental disinterest, which is, I think, the hardest one todeal with. It is the lack of attachment. Because we treat all forms of neglect thesame, we don't really understand the phenomenon very well. Perhaps we woulddo better to really study the neglect cases, to really learn from those parents inthe same way that we have interviews with serial killers, to try to learn whatmotivates them and to devise better strategies. The evaluation of Hawaii Healthy Start over a longer time and some other early intervention programs leads me to a great deal of concern about whetherwe will get the payoff for the amount of money that it takes to do this with thehard-to-reach families, where the propensity for later delinquency and criminalbehavior is the highest. I'm not at all convinced that having paraprofessionalswork in a home where there are eight children of umpteen different fathers isreally going to pay off when we have a low base-rate phenomenon\u2014whetherwe are going to see that much change. There are a whole lot of other benefitsfrom early intervention in addition to reduction of abuse and neglect and92Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence dealing with the consequences of abuse and neglect. But I think until we get our minds wrapped around what it is we are really trying to do in child welfarephilosophy, we are going to continue to have a lot of problems in terms ofpreventing further delinquency and adult criminal behavior. C.S.W.: Well, let me respond to that. First of all, although many of my cases do have multiple fathers for the children in the family, that wasn't one of thecharacteristics of the family that I described here. There were eight children;you're probably right\u2014they probably could have been sired by differentpeople. This case illustrates why I am arguing that it is not enough just to focuson the child. Successful interventions do not simply focus on a child. If onereads this literature, if one thinks about child development, it becomes appar-ent that the child is very much affected by the complicated dysfunctions ofthese parents as well as the communities. I think that it is a very importantpoint. Also, we know a lot more about neglect than we did many years ago.There are many forms of neglect that the child welfare/child protection systemdoes talk about. In my own work, however, I'm talking about a simple kind ofneglect\u2014it's a very powerful one, though. I'm talking about early neglect. Wehave eliminated the educational neglect that comes at a later point in time,especially if that's the only evidence of neglect. But these are cases of life-threatening failure to provide services to children: severe lack of food, cloth-ing, shelter, and medical attention. I'm not talking about psychologicalmaltreatment. My cases are from almost 30 years ago, now. I think what is important is to recognize the effects of deprivation of these fundamental needs in early childhood. There was a psychologist by the nameof Abraham Maslow who talked about a hierarchy of needs. At the verybottom of that hierarchy is the need for security, sustenance, the basic thingsin life. If we don't have that, if a child doesn't have food, clothing, shelter, ormedical attention, how can that child go to school and be a well-functioningchild? How can such children pay attention or keep their heads up in school?93Cathy Spatz Widom We don't know enough about the linkages and effects because the field of child maltreatment, in terms of research, is relatively new and vastlyunderfunded. But I think that in the case of my research, which connectsneglect of this sort with violent criminal behavior at a later point, we can'tdismiss the connection. Marc Mauer, The Sentencing Project, Washington, D.C.: Could you elabo- rate on what you spoke about as the potential negative consequences ofincreased surveillance? Wouldn't people make the argument that if moreproblems are found, the response should be more services? What is the prob-lem with doing that? C.S.W.: This is something that troubles me a lot. Although I really want to argue that we need to intervene in the lives of abused and neglected children,what stops me from endorsing that 100 percent (I don't know if you pickedthat up in my talk) is that we have these very troubling race-specific findings.Specifically, we find that for the African-American children in our sample(compared with the (control) African-American children\u2014those are kids whogrew up in the same neighborhoods, the only difference (at least on paper) isthat one group was abused and one group doesn't have an official record ofabuse), we find that the effects of childhood victimization are really enormous,very powerful, and much larger than the effects for white children in oursample who were similarly abused and neglected. We have been trying to findan explanation for this seeming difference in what should be a general phe-nomenon. It even seems to affect males and females. So why should it affect one group? One of the things that we think about is relevant to something Janet Reno talks about\u2014seeing a 3-year-old child or a 6-year-old child on the street at thewrong point in time. The community needs to respond to that child\u2014takehim or her home or whatever needs to be done. That is clearly a child in thewrong place. One hypothesis is that if we have a neglected child, it means that94Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence somebody's not paying attention to that child. That child may be out on the streets at the wrong time. If one has a child that is out on the streets, thatchild has more opportunities to get into trouble and to be picked up by thecops. And if that child happens to be an African-American, once that childgets connected to the juvenile justice system, it is very difficult to get out ofthe system. The child's attitudes may change, the child may develop hostili-ties, all kinds of things. So we are concerned that somehow, by following thesechildren and their families, we may not be responding to them and givingthem services in the same way. That's why I say if we can find a way to target these children with full appre- ciation of the delicate balance between making things better or worse forthem, then targeting would be the most effective. But I think we need to do alot more creative work to figure out how to do that. Marsha Renwanz, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.: I've heard you speak several times and am always struck by the importance of your findings about neglectfor the reasons that you mentioned, number of cases, etc. Given that we'renow embarking on this nationwide experiment with welfare reform in thedifferent States, do you have plans to look at several States in terms of risks ofearly neglect\u2014catastrophic neglect for infants and toddlers\u2014that you haveidentified? Will those risks be assessed by you or other researchers? C.S.W.: There is a project that some people are working on in the District of Columbia to develop a proposal to provide services for abused and neglectedchildren. The notion is that there will be an evaluation component to it, andI've been asked to help them with the evaluation component. I am way behindon all the other things that I was supposed to be doing when I was preparingthis talk, so I'm trying to figure out how I can be involved. This is the onlyprogram that I know of, and that is in the infancy stage. But I am sure that thereare lots of people in this room who know of programs in their communities. The95Cathy Spatz Widom real question is whether, as I said to the gentleman from North Carolina, there is a serious evaluation that is planned. And I'm even happy to say, \"Let's have2 years of this program without an evaluation\"; get your program going. Maybejust collect some base-rate information. But let us evaluate these programs.Let us not simply run programs without learning something from them in asystematic way. Rosemary Chalk, Board on Children, Youth, and Families, National Re- search Council, Washington, D.C.: I want to pursue the whole issue of targeted versus universal interventions. David Lloyd earlier expressed hisskepticism about the home visitation approach, based on the results of theHawaii effort. I think it's very important to distinguish the home visitationmodel used in Hawaii from that used in the Olds study. There are differenttypes of skills involved, differences in terms of the timing of the intervention.Using the Olds model the intervention seems to have the greatest impact onadolescent first-time mothers, and the impact may have been moderated bytheir ability to delay a second pregnancy. So we may not be talking about eightchildren in the household, maybe now about four. We know that neglectoccurs in families that have very high numbers of children\u2014that's often afamily characteristic. The whole issue of spacing pregnancies becomes a keyoutcome measure in looking at the effects of some of the home visitationinterventions. I haven't heard you say anything about neighborhoods. It may be that one strategy to use in trying to balance this question of targeting families versusuniversal interventions is to look at the kinds of neighborhoods in which casesof abuse and neglect tend to concentrate and see whether we can think ofsome selection criteria. If we have a neighborhood context, we might want totarget the intervention on any first-time mothers in that neighborhood,regardless of their family situation or individual characteristics. We could usegeographic criteria and look at the role of unrelated adults within that neigh-96Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence borhood as support systems and as support resources who may be helpful in maintaining the quality, timing, and dosage of the intervention that would beoffered through some type of organizational approach in its initial stages. C.S.W.: I'm glad you brought up the issue. I appreciate the point about the Hawaii program. One of the programs that I didn't mention follows a model thatuses paraprofessionals versus the public health nurse model\u2014they are verydifferent. You can imagine different costs associated with them. One thing Ithink we need to do is to examine the extent to which these two models mayhave different effectiveness. If one were to engage in a larger scale intervention,I would like to see both models tried and pitted against one another. I did mention neighborhoods though, and I think that neighborhoods and communities are terribly important. There is a difficulty in targeting neighbor-hoods. I thought about saying, \"Let's take six cities: D.C., Detroit, Gary, etc.,\"cities with big crime problems. The difficulty is that, if we target by neighbor-hood, we are essentially picking African-American and minority communities.I have a real problem with the issue of stigmatization. James Comer, for example, in his work and programs on schools, specifically chose to do his work in the school system. He worked with the entire schoolsystem, so there would not be these issues of unwillingness to accept theresources that might be offered. I think taking a geographic area that does havea high crime problem (like D.C.), taking these kids and starting with thepregnant mother, one is going to get those very high-risk families. As long aswe keep track, do a needs assessment at the beginning of such an experiment,and then follow through, we would be able to determine whether it is only themost high-risk mothers and families that are benefiting. But in the United States 50 or 75 years ago, there were public health nurses going into communities and doing exactly what David Olds' program is doing now,especially in rural or isolated areas. So it is not drawing from the British or drawingfrom the French, it is going back to a historical time in the United States.97Cathy Spatz Widom Rebecca Burkhalter, Burkhalter Associates, Inc., Washington, D.C.: My question relates to the fact that many of these children we are talking about aspreschoolers or infants are going to be in the hands of daycare workers morethan anyone else. I was involved in that for many years. One thing thatdisturbed me, and I am wondering if it has changed, was the absence of re-quired skills and training in daycare workers. We really said, \"Well, if she is anice person. . . .\" It didn't matter if she was qualified in early childhooddevelopment. If these people are going to be dealing with high-risk infants,they need to know something about children. Are we going to require more?And are we, as a Nation, going to feel that they are regular teachers and notjust daycare workers and babysitters? C.S.W.: I have no particular expertise to answer the question you're asking me. I would rather turn it back on the audience. Shay Bilchik, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.: To build upon a couple of points that were made about the Hawaii Healthy Start model versus home visitationthrough nurses (and targeting), right now we are in the middle of a projectwith David Olds in which we are replicating some of his work in six differentcommunities, using that model in a targeted way through the Weed and SeedOffice (partnering with Health and Human Services, the Weed and SeedOffice, and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention). Weare finding 100 first-time mothers in those communities to show how we couldinterrupt that pathway with delayed subsequent births and less welfare depen-dency. I know that David Olds is about to come out with a 15-year update onhis original study that hopefully will show even more promising results. C.S.W.: I'm very excited about that. I can't wait to see the results. But one thing that I think we have to remember, getting back to Rosemary's commentand others', is that anything that we can do to help the development of thesechildren from a very early point is going to have positive benefits. So if we can98have fewer low-birth-weight babies for these high-risk mothers, if we can have better health care\u2014all of these things that one would think we would be ableto do routinely\u2014in turn are going to lead to healthier children, children whocan perform better academically, and that is such a critical life point for thesechildren. It is a time when they become so susceptible to delinquent peergroups and all the other bad things. Once they are in that risk category, it issimply a playing-out of problem behaviors. Shay Bilchik, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.: Cathy, the most promising part of your talk and of the work in this area is that it highlights the gap that existsbetween the ideal that you're talking about and what we are presently provid-ing to these families. For policymakers it is critical to know that the gap issignificant and that there needs to be a substantial investment just to get us toground zero in doing this kind of work.Child Victims: In Search of Opportunities for Breaking the Cycle of Violence99Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse Presentation by Norval Morris, LL.M., Ph.D. University of Chicago Law School May 13, 1997 Washington, D.C. For 17 years after the end of World War II, I wandered the prisons of England, Australia, the United States, and a variety of Asian countries. I then found a degree of residentialstability, and for the past 35 years from an excellent base inChicago, I have done my best to understand the phenomenaof the treatment and prevention of crime. Now, stimulatedby the invitation to participate in this series of lectures, I amobliged to give a partial accounting, an apologia. If it provesa disastrous effort, blame Jeremy Travis; if it attracts yourinterest, praise Jeremy Travis. My plan is to reflect upon the current public and political dialogue concerning crime and its treatment, to consider therelationship between knowledge and practice on that topic,to discuss the extent to which our problems are unique to thiscountry, and to discuss why it is that we know so much better than we do.100Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse It is not easy to try to speak truth to power. Those with power grow confident that truth is an adjunct of power; they do not welcome the naysayer whopropounds a different truth. Power nowadays resides in Washington, andWashington purports to know what to do about crime and drugs and sentenc-ing convicted criminals\u2014and uses its power of the purse to try to impose itsideas on the rest of the country. Likewise, the national media purport to know the citizenry's prejudices about crime and profit by catering to and reinforcing those prejudices. The naysayergets rare and brief mention. So one who risks playing that naysayer cannot expect a rapturous reception, rather the contrary. Nevertheless it seems to me clear that the policies of bothpolitical parties about crime and drugs and sentencing are profoundly mis-guided and that it is my miserable duty to say so. Safer societies are not builton capital punishment, mandatory minimum punishments, three-strikes rules,and fierce drug policies that every informed observer knows to be misguided. Of course, I do not deceive myself that my perspective on truth is truth, but it is certainly not misled by the temptations of power. I think it was a French theologian of the Middle Ages who said, \"The most corrupting lie is the truth poorly told.\" That text, in my view, precisely captures the mischief of the public and political dialogue about crime and its treatment. The media and politiciansalike select and sensationalize dramatic and grossly unrepresentative crimesand criminals so that emotion dominates reason and social injury overcomessocial protection. The current political and public dialogue about crime is utterly bereft of sense. On one side are the mindless punishers, confidently planning to reduce crimeby relying on the supposed efficacy of condign punishment of convicted101Norval Morris criminals by larger and larger doses of imprisonment and increasing use of the death penalty. \"Nothing else works\" is their war cry. On the other side arethose who suggest that only a program designed to eliminate social inequalitycan be effective in dealing with crime. But for the most part a malaise com-pounded of fear, apathy, and inertia prevails, with being \"tough on crime\"functioning as a condition precedent to holding elective office. If ingenuous utopianism is unhelpful, so also is the posture of cynical dystopianism, which knows that nothing works, nothing can change. Not allcrime is a natural phenomenon. Crime does not consist of inevitable episodeswhich can in no way be foreseen or guarded against. The histories of thiscountry's prohibition of alcohol and inept treatment of drugs and guns revealthat the development of violent crime on a scale far higher than in othercomparably developed countries can be stimulated by legislative action. So, let me turn to the relationship between practice and knowledge in this field.I served on the Police Board of the City of Chicago for 8 years. Each month we held a public meeting. At every such meeting the superintendent (whoever hewas for the time being\u2014they came and went with the political winds) wouldannounce the crime statistics, district by district, comparing the last month'sfigures for the current year with the figures for the same month in the previousyear. If crime had decreased in a district, he would compliment the districtcommander and his troops on their efficiency, diligence, and great value to thecommunity. If crime had increased in a district, he would castigate the com-munity for their lack of moral and ethical values and note their need for evenmore intensive policing. He never lost; he was always right. In recent years, legislators advocating increased severity of punishment bewail the alleged sentimentality of the judiciary and impose mandatory-sentencinglaws, truth-in-sentencing laws, and three-strikes laws to constrain judicialdiscretion. Thus excessive severity flourishes. If crime decreases, the legislators102Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse congratulate themselves loudly on their contribution to social welfare. If crime increases, they reflect on how much worse things would be had they not actedand congratulate themselves loudly on their contribution to social welfare.Like the several superintendents of Chicago's police, they never lose\u2014they arealways right. Their nostrums are working, and the dosage must therefore beincreased; or their nostrums are not working sufficiently, and the dosage musttherefore be increased. Recently, the prison population has quadrupled by reason of the current attitude to punishment and the length of time prisoners are required to serve.If thereafter crime decreases, prison has \"worked\" (as some say in the UnitedStates and now in the United Kingdom). If crime thereafter increases, it isclear that the dosage must be increased and more and longer imprisonmentimposed. Again, whatever happens, it has succeeded; it is the appropriate andnecessary remedy. To think otherwise is to be a maudlin sentimentalist, moreconcerned with the wretched prisoner than the injured victim. Where does the discipline of criminology stand in relation to these police, court, and corrections scenarios that you all recognize? The answer, I regret, is \"on thesidelines.\" Does this mean that knowledge is irrelevant to the field of our inter-ests? I think not. When I came to Chicago 35 years ago, there was an appreciablegap between knowledge and practice in crime control. In the intervening threeand one-half decades, that gap has grown wider, not thinner, so that it is now achasm, a gulf, not merely a gap. Relevant knowledge has been acquired; practicehas degenerated. What do we know about crime control? Let me make a comparison with the history of medicine (which is not to suggest that crime is a disease). I choosethe year 1914. In that year a great deal was known about the prevention ofdisease: the contributions of pure water, sewage control, general sanitation, theelimination of rodent infestation, vaccination, anesthetics, and similar disease-prevention and pain-reduction methods were known and applied. What was103Norval Morris very much less well known was what to do about a disease or an injury when one had occurred. Now consider crime control in 1997. We know a lot about the soil in the home and in the community in which crime and delinquency flourish. I couldtake any one of you to any city, fly you over it, drive you through it, have youtalk to no one, and then ask you to mark on a map those areas with high crimeand delinquency rates. You would do it about as well as the chief of police ofthat city. We cannot state the etiology of crime and delinquency in a general,all-embracing theory, but we certainly are well aware of the environment,associations, and family conditions in which crime and delinquency flourish.But, given a criminal or delinquent event, our knowledge of what to do aboutit remains scant. Has medicine changed in the intervening 83 years? It certainly has. Knowledge of interventions for the relief of suffering from disease and injury has increaseddramatically and, subject to the continuing constraints of inequitable socialsystems, is applied with skill and efficacy. There are many reasons for this phoenixlike mutation of the barber into the surgeon, but not the least was the gradual emergence of a treatment classifica-tion system related to reasonably precisely defined diseases and injuries. Thiswe lack in criminology. A similar lack in medicine would mean, I believe, thatmore than one of every three of us in this room would not be here\u2014we wouldbe dead. Lacking serious evaluations of our treatment interventions and lacking clinical trials, we rely on unreliable, retrospective, statistical matching techniques andevaluations by partisans (conscious or self-deceiving) of the outcome of thestudy. And recently we have been collecting these unreliable studies into whatwe pretentiously call megastudies or meta-analyses, multiplying error by no means ideologically one-sided: meta-analyses can104Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse establish that \"deterrence works\" as well as that \"treatment works\"; the trick lies in the spurious belief that adding together a steady flow of faulty studies obliter-ates their defects. And, in any event, all these outcomes are related to definitionsof the group to be treated and by a diversity of treatments, both so wide as todefy useful outcome analysis. 1 Two of my ideas have been put to the test of independent clinical trials. A planfor a prison for repetitively violent offenders was tested in the Federal correc-tional center at Butner, North Carolina; a plan for structured plea bargaining,involving the victims of the crime should they wish to be involved, was tested incourts in Dade County, Florida. I had nothing to do with the evaluative pro-cesses for either of these experiments. Neither produced the results I had bothhoped for and predicted. The clinical trial in the prison did not reduce recidi-vism. Only one-third of victims attended the plea bargaining sessions. Were theyfailures? Not at all. A great deal was learned from the Butner prison about therole and organization of prison programs; a great deal about speedy trial and theneeds of crime victims was learned from the Dade County courts. Both weredifficult to run, indeed, in a sense the prison trial broke down early because thedistinctive features of the Butner prison were copied by other Federal and Stateprisons (and a few prisons in other countries) before the clinical trial could berun, so that the researchers lost the control group rather than the treatmentgroup. But both contributed to knowledge far more than any philosophic studyby an academic criminologist. It will take decades to develop even the outline of a prevention and treatment classification system in criminology equivalent to those in medicine; neverthelessit is the only rational path to the effective prevention and treatment of crime. But in the meantime we already have enough knowledge to do a lot better than we now do. Setting the future aside, what of the present? It seems to methat bad crime control policies have driven out better crime control policies.105Norval Morris Over the half-century of my observations, the police, the courts, the correc- tional authorities, and the scholars of criminology have all greatly improvedthe quality of their work. The police have become better trained, less venal, less brutal, less corrupt, and much more efficient. They have recognized the limitations of their role and theirneed for collaboration with the various communities they serve. And slowly theyare coming to understand the need for the closest collaboration with privatepolice, who, in most industrial countries, outnumber them and are the mainproviders of police services for other persons than the poor. The courts handling criminal matters have been increasingly burdened by swelling caseloads, but they have developed better case management systems and there issome improvement (though far from enough) in the appointment of theirsupport personnel. The staff of the prisons and probation services are far better trained, far better led, and clearly more efficient and decent than their predecessors whom I met 50 years ago. And finally, in this catalog of virtues, scholarship and research concerning the criminal justice system and the statistical data on which policy decisions should be based haveimproved dramatically. We now know a great deal more than we did 50 years ago, notonly about the soil in which crime flourishes but also about what to do about it. Why, then, given all these advances over the same time period, have problems of crime in our society grown worse rather than better? Starkly opposing the encouraging positive developments in the work of the police, the courts, and corrections that I have listed, one must acknowledgetwo powerful negative forces. Legislators, Federal and State, of both parties,have politicized their interventions on crime control in ways which are almostuniformly counterproductive and are widely known to be counterproductive.Cheaply, they buy votes by stimulating the fears of many and sacrificing the106Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse freedom of others. This process continues today, urged on by distressingly superficial proposals by the leaders of both political parties. Every informedstudent of drug policy, including such tough-on-crime observers as James Q.Wilson and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, acknowledges that mass arrests of retaildrug sellers, source-country eradication programs, and interdiction efforts areineffective. Wilson advanced this opinion in the late 1980s. Yet, inexorably,year by year the budgets for these initiatives increase, and politicians claim tobelieve that they work. 2 The politicians, Federal and State, have been abetted in this mischief by thegreatly increased attention that the media (print and electronic) pay tosensational aspects of criminality. For them it is cheap and popular, easy toacquire and display, and by statistical reality there is always plenty to acquireand display. Hence, Gresham's Law applies: False political promises and the sensationalism of the media drive out rational policy. As Dean Pound of the Harvard LawSchool suggested, if the 18th century was the century of the Enlightenment, and the 19th century the century of Empiricism, our century has been the century ofEmotionalism. For many years I have associated with prison administrators, senior police, and judges and lawyers involved in the criminal courts. A leading impression thatI am left with is that the public perception of crime and its treatment is farremoved from the realities with which the wardens and judges and police dailydeal. Over the last 20 years, the correctional people\u2014prison and probationadministrators\u2014as well as a substantial number of judicial and police leadershave been radicalized. They believe, as I do, that many of our crime controlpolicies do more harm than good. But talking with them with a drink in handis an experience far removed from listening to them speak in public. In publicthey avoid criticism; in private there is little else. Radicals they have become,yes, but publicly silent radicals.107Norval Morris And this is true of many elected officials. In private, they will admit that much of our crime control policy is cruel, wasteful, and ineffective. In public, theysay otherwise. For example, consider the 100:1 difference there was betweensanctions for crack and for cocaine in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. It isdoubtful that any member of Congress believed this extreme distinction madesense and yet virtually none was prepared to vote to support the U.S. Sentenc-ing Commission's proposed elimination of the differential. With few exceptions, the functionaries of the media seem to me to parrot what is said in public and fail to bring to bear on crime and punishment the cyni-cism on which they pride themselves. \"Crime does not pay,\" I am told. The hell it doesn't! It clearly pays the news- paper publishers and the TV giants. It pays many of us in this room, evenhelping my family somehow to survive on an academic salary. But it pays thepublishers extraordinarily well\u2014and increasingly they rely on it to fill theairwaves and newspapers. Crime news is cheap to acquire. For local TV, one camera and one camera crew led by an inexperienced or about-to-retire reporter suffice to gather thepolice handout and have the arrested suspect led disconsolate across the pathof the camera's eye. The stereotypes of the criminal and the prisoner in the public's mind thus become projections of the exceptional and unrepresentative criminals they haveseen or read of in the daily flood of television and newspaper sensationalism. Politicians properly caring for their election or reelection, who also wish responsibly to advance social welfare, require the existence of a reasonablywell-informed public. Here is where the corrupting half-truths of the mediaproduce the dominating sensationalism of crime news and the false promises ofquick and emotionally satisfying punitive responses to criminals. \"The most108Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse corrupting lie is the truth poorly told.\" Populism is pressed on the politicians in this way, and of all the great cities of the United States, the District ofColumbia\u2014followed closely by Los Angeles\u2014seems to have the disease inits most virulent form. Let me give some numerical details to this flood of sensationalism about crime, this corruption of truth poorly told. The Center for Media and Public Affairs in this city keeps a record of the number of crime stories on the ABC, CBS, and NBC evening national televi-sion news broadcasts. From 1991 to 1995 inclusive, the frequency of crimestories increased by a factor of four\u2014four times as many in 1995 as in 1991!For the years 1993 through 1995, crime was at the top of the list of newsstories,outranking the war in Bosnia, health issues, the economy, and the Federalbudget. In 1996, however, crime fell to second place, being bumped out of firstplace by the Presidential campaign. Please note that over these 6 years, thisgrossly increasing preoccupation with crime stories came at a time of steadilydeclining crime and violence. 3 This skewed focus on the sensational aspects of crime is, of course, evengreater in local, as distinct from national, television sound bites. Aided and abetted by this flood of misinformation, the politicians\u2014Federal, State, and local\u2014foster the view that the public demands our present \"gettough\" policies. This may be true, but it is difficult to be sure, because opinionpolls on that question give a variety of answers depending mainly on the formof the questions asked. A careful study by Professor Katherine Beckett soon tobe published by Oxford University Press establishes that, when one analyzespolitical statements and public opinion polls on given issues in this arena, itbecomes clear that the political statements antedate the opinion polls. Theyinteract, of course, but there is no \"chicken and egg\" argument here. It is thepolitical statements and the way that they are reported that generate changesin the opinion polls, not the reverse. 4109Norval Morris Heated argument surrounds the question of whether this outpouring of media violence increases the actualities of violence, but there is no argument whatso-ever that it shapes the public stereotype of the criminal and thus leads tounintelligent public policies concerning the prevention and treatment ofcrime and violence. One quality deeply influencing the political and public dialogue in this country is the belief that our problems of crime and punishment are profoundly differentfrom those of other Western industrialized countries. We have far worse prob-lems, I am constantly told, because our vast, racially and ethnically heteroge-neous population, dedicated to the protection of individual freedom, generatescrime on a scale far different from those other countries. This thought is regu-larly offered to justify the unusual severity of our system of punishment. Until recently there was a pervasive myth that crime in the United States far exceeded that in other Western industrialized countries, that it was annuallyand inexorably increasing, and that its cruel advance could be met only byunrelenting severity. In the last few years it has come to be appreciated thatsince 1990 we have witnessed a decline in the incidence of most categories ofcrime, including homicide, but the public still holds to the view that crime inthese Excited States is far worse than in Western Europe, Canada, Australia,or New Zealand. This belief is wildly wrong, but it is held as an article of faithby most people. We have hard data on this\u2014data gathered by identical means in those other- wise similar countries by projects in which the Department of Justice played aleading role. The blunt conclusions are these: Crime rates in the United Statesare slightly on the high side compared with the average of those countries, butin only two categories of crime are we clearly at the top\u2014homicide and gunrobbery. We do not lead in property crime, theft, robbery, rape, or burglary.We certainly do lead in homicide and gun robbery\u2014far ahead of the field. 5110Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse As my excellent ex-colleagues Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins demon- strate in a book soon to be published, crime is not the problem. Violence is theproblem. To confuse the two, as we do in our sentencing policies and commu-nity protection policies, is a sin against the light, generating inefficiency andproducing cruelty. 6 This is an essential insight, highly relevant to shaping our crime preventionand control measures, but it is only the beginning of what serious, comparativecriminological research could supply. Fifty years ago, from internationalcomparisons of \"two and three strikes and you're out\" laws in continentalEurope and England in the last quarter of the 19th century, and in Englandand this country in the first half of the 20th century, I learned of the futilityand the inexorable failure of such legislation. Now we seem doomed to learnthat lesson again. 7 We may also lead other countries in this popular \"which is the worst\" competi-tion in the ingestion of prohibited drugs. It is impossible, however, to makereliable international comparisons on that topic, because no other countryrelies to the extent that we do on the criminal law to reduce the ingestion ofdrugs. They all prohibit the usual drugs\u2014no Western country legalizes thosedrugs, as some people still seem to believe (and that certainly includes Englandand the Netherlands), but none either makes the criminal conviction the frontline of defense. All prefer policies of harm reduction in which criminal pro-scriptions play their proper, lesser, and supportive role. By international standards, therefore, our crime problem is not unique; it is quite ordinary and is likely to stay quite ordinary. What is unique is our problem ofviolence and our extraordinary use of imprisonment as a punishment, ourimprisonment rate being over six times that of any of those other countries. Until it is better understood that our problem is not crime per se, but crimi- nal violence, there is little chance of our making headway toward rational111Norval Morris prevention and punishment of crime and violence. It sounds like a small point, but it is of central importance. The human animal, particularly the young adult human male, has a propensity to violence in all cultures and all ethnicities, yet produces very different ratesof violence. Break these diversities down by categories of crime, age, culture,instrumentalities of violence, and other relevant distinctions and relate thedisaggregated differences to the role of the criminal justice system, and knowl-edge of more effective primary and secondary prevention efforts will inevitablyadvance. The neglect of these comparative opportunities between countries and be- tween States within our own vast country encourages emotional rather thanrational responses to the genesis and commission of delinquency and crime.Research on these issues is urgently needed and requires Federal support. Itshould take up the slack of our alleged demonstration projects, which aregenerally retrospectively analyzed by their advocates or those close to themand are widely understood to belong to the skills of Madison Avenue ratherthan to social science. Rudyard Kipling, too often seen as a xenophobe, put the case for comparative criminological research with poetic power: \"And what should they know ofEngland, who only England know?\" Recently, that astonishing Polish poet,Wislawa Szymborska, put the same thought even more sharply: \"Get to knowother worlds, if only for comparison.\" Comparative criminological research should be pursued, not to denigrate or emulate foreign practice; rather it should be pursued to advance knowledge ofwhat we do and what we might do better. Volume 21 of Crime and Justice: A Review of Research , entitled \"Ethnicity, Crime, and Immigration,\" edited by Michael Tonry, was subsidized by the U.S. National Institute of Justice and thegovernments of five European countries. The book brings together data on race,112Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse ethnicity, and crime in nine countries. It is a model of what comparative research would produce. It is an opening wedge to a core of policy-related knowledge. The public and political discourse to the contrary notwithstanding, until the United States develops responsible policies about drugs and guns, there is littlelikelihood of bringing even relative peace to our destroyed inner-city areas. Ido not mean that drugs and guns describe the entirety of the problem. They donot, but sensible drug and gun policies are conditions precedent to change. The strident peddlers of cheap and swift solutions to the problems of crime in this country have become too powerful by far. Rethinking our policies on gunsand drugs is an urgent necessity. I am told that even rational policies nowwould take decades to have significant effect. That may well be so, but thepreachments have been made and ignored for many decades already. Let me add a third item to this preachment\u2014we must also join the rest of the allegedly civilized world in our punishment of homicide. Capital punishmenthas no place. This would have no effect on homicide rates, but it is an impor-tant symbol of rationality. Let me make the case for that also by a comparison with another country, taken from my storehouse of anecdotage. In October 1958, I was invited by theGovernor-General of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to be Chairman of the Commissionof Inquiry on Capital Punishment. Then and now, Ceylon did indeed suffer ahigh homicide rate, a rate which tested the beliefs of an abolitionist. But as wetook testimony and visited the courts, prisons, and villages of that lovely countryand came to learn of its culture, economy, and politics, the reasons for this ratebecame apparent and seemed independent of the different likely punishmentsfor killing. It became clear that if one action would diminish the rate of these killings it would have been a precise survey of landholdings. Lacking this, with a testamentary law113Norval Morris that divided land equally among the male survivors of the deceased owner, brother fought brother over who owned that coconut tree on or near the borderof their lands. These conflicts were fueled by the liquor laws, which put highgovernment taxes on alcohol, but did nothing to inhibit the production of\"palmyra toddy,\" a vicious, homegrown, fiery beverage. These conflicts foundtheir instrumentalities of violence in the curved coconut knife. And the wholemixture was fertilized by racial and religious intolerance between Tamils andSinghalese. Compared with these pressures, the death penalty was a trivial factorin the brew that sustained homicide rates in Ceylon. 8 Let me leave Ceylon and suggest that similar analysis of homicide in allcountries with abnormally high homicide rates is the clue to an understand-ing of those rates. In some societies the homicide numbers inflate\u2014inCeylon for the reasons suggested above, in Colombia for reasons of politicalturmoil and cocaine production and distribution, in the United States . . .well, why? Could it be the obvious analogs of the coconut knife, palmyratoddy, and racial intolerance? The unconscionable search for votes in legislatures, Federal and State, by increasingly expansive and unenforced laws concerning capital punishmentwill have no measurable effect on homicide rates and none on other rates ofviolence and crime. With well over 3,000 inmates now on death rows andabout 60 executions a year, the present laws relevant to capital punishmentare fundamentally unsatisfactory to retentionists and abolitionists alike.Major and, in my view, unwise, Federal initiatives may in time somewhatreduce the delay between the pronouncement of the death sentence and theexecution, but it remains an exercise in hubris to think that we can distin-guish the more wicked homicides from the less wicked homicides and con-fine executions to the former. I am told that the Archangel Gabriel canperform this feat. I know I cannot. I know the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates cannot. While we live in a constitutional democracy, there is onlyone way out.114Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse Back to Ceylon to conclude. An eighth-century Buddhist king solved the capital punishment problem. To increase the symbolic and deterrent effects of execu-tion, he proclaimed that the heads of executed murderers would be set onpikestaffs high on the castle walls for all to see. Suitably gruesome heads werethen removed from citizens who had recently died of natural causes. Bloody andcontorted, they were indistinguishable from the real things. They were thenexposed high on the castle walls to demonstrate the grim fate of murderers. I canthink of no similar ruse available to us. Again, on this topic we had better jointhe rest of the civilized world. Mine is a traditional preachment. Enact sensible and enforceable laws about guns, drugs, and the punishment of crime. Learn from such responsible studiesas have been done and from the experience of other countries. It has takenmany decades of emotional and mindless wars on crime and drugs for us toreach our present absurd situation. It will take decades to get back on track,but sometime we must take the first steps, and for drugs, guns, and sentencing,the first steps are obvious and long, long, long overdue. You say I have devoted this talk to demolition rather than to construction, to carping criticism rather than to creative suggestions. You are right, butI make no apology. Our legislatures, Federal and State, have forgotten aprimary obligation\u2014 primum non nocere \u2014in the first place, don't make the disease worse. I conclude with a sentence of my mentor and friend, Glanville Williams (who died last month), one of the 20th century's two greatest English-speakinganalysts of the criminal law: \"Criminal law is an instrument to be used tofurther the well-being of society and not to diminish that well-being.\" Do we have the integrity, the political will, indeed the courage, to try so to use it ?115Norval Morris Question-and-Answer Session Patrick Murphy, U.S. Conference of Mayors, Washington D.C.: What has happened in gun control in the past 10 years or so, with the police becomingvocal, has had impact. Recently, police chiefs have been speaking out more onsome of the social issues. Your superintendent in Chicago, someone I regardvery highly, is very outspoken today on the issue of children. He's become aspokesman for a new organization, Stop Crime\u2014Invest in Kids. A number ofchiefs across the country have associated with that, and a smaller number ofchiefs with drug reform. I wonder if it is your view that the opinions and publicpositions of the police have an impact on legislators and the public. N.M.: Matt Rodriguez certainly pursues the possibility of minimizing the number of ill-educated, poor children who have handguns and automaticweaponry. That would seem obvious and important and good. It is of courseperfectly true that there has been a great change, particularly in the big-citypolice forces. I met with the IACP [International Association of Chiefs ofPolice] yesterday, and it is not as enthusiastic nationwide but it is encouraging.I think the point you are making is that I overstated the impression about notspeaking out. Well, perhaps. I talk to lots of people about why they are so silent. It's true that some of the police chiefs have become less silent and that's very encouraging andvery important. I wish the press took greater notice of it. Their reply\u2014many ofthem\u2014is, \"Well, it's easy for you!\" They are quite right. It takes no great courageto say what you think when you have that wonderful thing called tenure. It's alittle harder when your job and your family's health and well-being turns on thewhim of a political superior. But it is encouraging, and I am encouraged by thosechanges. I think we should all try to foster them. In relation to guns, there is an116Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse increasing line of good ideas. Jeremy Travis and James Wilson mentioned that in the first lecture here, and Jeremy is supporting them. Ted Gest, U.S. News & World Report , Washington, D.C.: I wanted to ask you to elaborate a bit on the public opinion polls, if you could. My reading ofthem\u2014and I read them pretty carefully too\u2014is that . . . I think you said that itdepends on what question you ask. When you ask the public if they wanthigher sentences, they say, \"Yes.\" When you also ask them (as we at U.S. News and others have), \"Do you favor preventive or rehabilitative approaches, even in comparison to prison sentences?\" They also say they do. So I wonder ifthe public opinion is really as one-sided as you make it out to be and if theproblem is that the politicians just don't act on certain parts of it. N.M.: Well, you are, of course, right. I had in mind the central importance of the form of the question, but I don't think you would deny that it is seen (atleast politically) as a guaranty either of resignation or non-reelection to beother than \"tough on crime.\" Part of that, I think, has been fostered by perva-sive opinion polls in one form. What I thought was interesting (and I thinkyou will find interesting) is Katherine Beckett's book, in which she establishesthat the public statements by politicians seem to antedate what the opinionpolls produce rather than the other way around. Obviously, I'm not suggestingwe not have a First Amendment; it's the great strength of the country. But I am wishing that there could be an increase in the number of good reporters(and there are some very good reporters). But it isn't the stuff that most peopleread. Most people read the \"tough on crime\" stuff, I think. And most politi-cians believe that too. I have a storehouse of anecdotage on that, most of itnot capable of being reported. Vince Schiraldi, Justice Policy Institute, Washington, D.C.: You talked a little about the need for research, but what struck me was that you talkedabout the widening gap between research and practice. I just wonder if ournumbers are not good\u2014if we perhaps don't already have quite an amount ofresearch at this time, and what we actually need to do is package and market it117Norval Morris better, the way the folks who want to lock more people up do. I wonder if you could say a little about that. A lot of good stuff exists in books of yours andother people's. Most of the public doesn't get a chance to see it. N.M.: Let me try and state what I believe more precisely. I think we have a lot of knowledge concerning the prevention of crime and delinquency\u2014that is tosay, primary prevention. We have a lot of knowledge relevant to that, and Ithink we should apply much of it. But the quite different step of trying todevelop a relationship between treatment interventions and crime/criminalsituations has not yet been taken. That will be very important for the future.So, we can do better with the storehouse of knowledge we have, but to doreally well, we have to begin clinical trials\u2014and there are very few. In my life, I have been associated with two clinical trials: one in relation to the Federal prison at Butner, North Carolina, in which a stratified random sampleof inmates sent to a new prison program was compared with a sample ofinmates in a traditional program. Another was in Dade County in five courts,an experiment concerning plea bargaining. The prison program broke down asa clinical trial because other prisons appropriately (and early) emulated one ofthe things being tested, which was voluntary programming. It simply worksbetter than compulsory programming. Second, the then-Federal parole boardstarted giving prisoners predicted release dates subject to good behavior. Thetwo things we were mainly testing at Butner prison were fixed release datesand voluntary programming. So we lost the control group and the clinical trialbroke down. But a great deal was learned about running prisons. And much ofit has been applied. In Dade County, plea bargaining is totally within the control of a prosecutor. If the prosecutor's office decides it will not do plea bargaining, plea bargainingwon't happen. They can stop it; you don't need legislation. So for the clinicaltrial we persuaded five courts in Dade County to notify the alleged criminaland counsel that there would be a pretrial meeting under the administration of118Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse a judge (not the trial judge, but a judge), at which the prosecutor would be present and to which the victim would be invited. At that one meeting, totallyoff the record, there would be a decision made of how to settle this question\u2014by confession, plea, or compensation\u2014and everyone would be heard, includingthe victim. We ran it for quite a protracted period; the outcome was entirelynegative, judged by severity of punishment and disposition of cases. They cameout much the same in the treatment group as they did in the control group.Only about a third of the victims came. I, at first, thought that was bad, but ifa third of victims want to come and do come, and are treated respectably,that's fine. The thing that most changed was speedy trial. If there couldn't be asettlement at that one meeting, the case was set down for trial. So it was a leapforward in knowledge. But we ignore this stuff. So I do believe that the crime/criminal relationship makes up a treatment entity. Available treatment resources, community-based or institution-based,make up other entities. We haven't done the matching. Samuel Dash, Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.: I think the last couple of questions and particularly your responses touch onthis but maybe not sufficiently. You've been involved enough in empiricalresearch, and there has been so much empirical research, particularly sincethe late 1960s and 1970s, on how to understand crime and how to intervenein crime. But very little of it called for more than the study and the publish-ing of the results. I remember when Roscoe Pound and Felix Frankfurterwent to Cleveland to study the Cleveland crime survey. They wrote awonderful book, but in the introduction, Frankfurter said, \"Prior to ourcoming here, there wasn't an understanding of why the people in Clevelandcouldn't control their crime. Now that we have been here and given themthe answers, there is no excuse.\" Haven't you thought (and perhaps you touched on it) that every research program, particularly those funded by the National Institute of Justice or anyother major foundation, ought to have as part of its methodology a require-119Norval Morris ment that there be an implementation and evaluation? The books sitting on the shelves gathering dust don't really communicate to the people as Frankfurternaively believed. Now, I agree\u2014you are quite right\u2014that politics, emotionalism, is the mortal enemy of research facts. But if it can be shown that this is not only informationin a book, but there is an implementation of it\u2014via a demonstration programand evaluation\u2014and that this is highly publicized, would this at least be a betterway to go? N.M.: Sam, there are always such countervailing pressures. The preoccupation with reducing the incidence of repetition of crime, which I take it is whatpeople talk about so much in evaluations, is really quite difficult to do. Thereare so many other pressures about. You don't make that same complaint aboutmedical research. Every serious medical research has some incremental betterunderstanding about a problem. And mostly, implicitly or explicitly, abouthow we can move forward. There aren't \"sort-of solutions\" to this \"repeating.\"It seems strange, but you didn't make man. People have all sorts of complexprocesses, and crime is going to continue at varying rates (not very seriousrates, actually, except for violence) no matter what we do. What we have tostart doing is less harm. It is a much harder case to make\u2014much harder! I go back to my analogy of the doctor in 1914. Since 1914, first of all, there was the cataclysm of the 1914-1918 War, with massive injuries and an extraordinaryrange of acquisition of knowledge about what to do and what not to do aboutthem. But second, there was the beginning of clinical trials. Each month, articlesfrom the New England Journal of Medicine are featured in the press. . . . I don't see anything like that in our field. I'm not making the \"crime is a disease\" point; I'msimply talking about the fact that if we want to do better in this field, we have alot of knowledge (Frankfurter was right presumably) about how to stop doingharm, and we are gradually acquiring knowledge about how to do better. But no,I don't think people who try to find out facts of issues understand the politics orunderstand the other pressures that inhibit change.120Crime, the Media, and Our Public Discourse D. Alan Henry, Pretrial Services Resource Center, Washington, D.C.: It seems that the most current and popular way for legislatures to address theproblem of violence is evidenced by the 42 States that have, within the past 3years, expanded their laws to target children and to charge them as adults. Wesee currently that the House has just passed a bill that would expand signifi-cantly the age and the charge groups, which traditionally had been in thejuvenile system, that would be brought into the adult system. I wonder if youcould comment on that, telescope ahead, and tell us how you see the adultcourts and adult correctional systems dealing with this and whether you thinkit will address violence. N.M.: Well, it seems to me a perfect paradigm, an example of politics and emotionalism dominating good sense. The movement you speak of seems to bebased in part on the belief that the juvenile courts of the United States aresentimentally lenient. I go periodically to visit the first children's court in thiscountry, the Children's Court in Cook County. It is overcrowded. Its leadingcharacteristic is the continuance. It doesn't have anything like the sort ofsentimental care for the child that it is supposed to have. Good people areworking in it. It's flooded. So all of this about controlling violence in childrenby procedures of their trial is an irrelevancy. Trying juveniles as adults is not even likely to result in more severe punishment. It is a little more severe in theduration of detention prior to trial. Really, I think it is a perfect example ofspinning wheels to no effect whatsoever, except perhaps some emotionalsatisfaction for some people. Timothy J. Flanagan, Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas: Professor Morris, could you comment a little bit on who's leading and who'sfollowing in the public debate about life within prisons? It seems to me thepolls show that the American public still has very strong expectations aboutthe provision of rehabilitative services within prisons, but the politicians areonly hearing the message of \"fewer services\" and \"tougher prisons.\"121Norval Morris N.M.: Well, I think that this is one of the problems that has radicalized the prison administrators. I visit quite a few State prisons, and the general viewthat I get from senior people is that they think that roughly one-quarter of thepeople in their institutions\u2014these are the crowded inner-city ones\u2014shouldn'tbe there. I think they are probably right. To run the institutions, activities forprisoners are essential as an administrative matter. And there is no doubt thatsome prisoners are assisted as a result of rehabilitation programs, in terms ofcost-benefit. It's not a huge amount of funds to expend, and the programs dohelp some prisoners. The thought that prisons are thus made into countryclubs can only be held by people whose knowledge stops at the front gate. You have all been kind enough to throw up questions that illustrate my point: in this field, emotion dominates reason.123Notes Lecture 1: What, If Anything, Can the Federal Government Do About Crime? 1.

The home visitation program in Elmira, New York, was analyzed and the net cost was determined: $3,173 for 2years of intervention (including personnel salaries andbenefits, travel expenses, supplies, staff training, and amodest overhead charge). By the time the children wereage 4, low-income families who had received a nurse homevisitor during pregnancy and through the second year of thechild's life cost the government $3,313 less than compari-son group children. Government savings were estimated asthe difference in utilization of AFDC, food stamps, Medic-aid, and child protection services minus tax revenues due tomaternal employment (Olds, D., C.
