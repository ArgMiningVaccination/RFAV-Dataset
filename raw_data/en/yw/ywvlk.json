Design: A rand... 2010 ABSTRACT. Objective. Otitis media is 1 of the most frequent diseases of early infancy and childhood and 1 of the most common reasons for children to visit a physi- cian. In the past 2 decades, there has been a substantial increase in the diagnosis of otitis media worldwide. In the United States, 93% of all children have had at least Health Sciences & ... 2006 Evidence report/technology assessment Acute Otitis Media (AOM), a viral or bacterial infection of the ear, is the most common childhood infection for which antibiotics are prescribed in the United States. In 2001, the Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center conducted a systematic review of the evidence comparing treatments of AOM. This review updates the 2001 review findings on diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated AOM, assesses the evidence for treatment of recurrent AOM, and assesses the impact of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV7) vaccine on the microbiology of AOM. DATA SOURCES and Searches of PubMed\u00ae and the Cochrane databases were conducted from January 1998 to July 2010 using the same search strategies used for the 2001 report, with the addition of terms not considered in the 2001 review. The Web of Science was also searched for citations of the 2001 report and its peer-reviewed publications. After review by two investigators against pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria, we include... Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 2017 Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanos... Medycyna wieku rozwojowego A growing interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is observed in treatment of patients with cancer. The use of CAM often leads to delay or resignation from anticancer treatment. Estimation of the extent of application of CAM methods among children and adolescents treated for cancer, as well as analysis of factors contributing to this decision. A survey based on a questionnaire was performed among 100 patients treated for cancer, including 47 girls and 53 boys, aged 5 months to 25 years (median 9.4 years). The questionnaire was filled-in by patients aged over 16, or by parents. It was found that at least 43% children with cancer were treated with at least one CAM method. The most often used methods were: spiritualism, herbal medicine, bioenergotherapy or diet (46.5%, 42%, 37% and 28% of CAM users, respectively). Odds ratio of the use of CAM methods was 23-fold higher (p<0.0001) in families with earlier own experience. The use of CAM was independent of place of res...
