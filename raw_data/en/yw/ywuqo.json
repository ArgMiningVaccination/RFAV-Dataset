Hi Lindsey, how has your perspective on work-life balance evolved over time? When the pandemic hit this year, I think it gave many of us a chance to reassess what work-life balance actually looks like. As a massage therapist during the lock down, I was suddenly deprived of much of my income, but I also had this fantastic realization of how much I was trying to fit in to one day or one work week. The pace I had been forcing myself to maintain was not sustainable. I have since let go of my massage practice (after 20 years!) and have transitioned to only doing online Intuitive Healing Sessions and teaching about essential oils (which I had already begun to transition to an online platform). My massage practice had been out of my home office, and though I do miss the hands on work with my beloved clients, it feels freeing to have my home be my home and not my office too! It turns out, the slow down from forced lock down was exactly what I needed to get some perspective on how I spend my days. I feel more protective of my time with my family (and my alone time) now. Can you open up a bit about your work and career? We're big fans and we'd love for our community to learn more about your work. What do you want the world to know about your brand or story? I am passionate about my work as an intuitive healer. It feeds my soul! For me, it means tuning into my client's energy and from there connecting them to their own Divinity to access healing for their spirit and their soul's evolution. Often times people come to me to work on an emotional issue or relationship dynamic they are struggling with. Or they are feeling overwhelmed and can't manage their own energy or are unconsciously managing everyone else's energy as a coping mechanism. One common thing I also see now is overwhelm. So many of us are dealing with an immense amount of stress, with little awareness or understanding of how to manage it in our systems. My job is to support them in grounding, releasing and unwinding held trauma and stress within the body, so they can feel safe and supported. I often bring essential oils into healing sessions to support the body in shifting and transforming stuck energy. They soothe our nervous system and support immune function. The more stressed out we are, the more our immune systems struggle! The sensory experience of scent, and touching the body to apply the oils is incredibly healing as well. They (essential oils) connect us to nature and give our bodies a bioenergetic recharge, which supports us when we are feeling depleted and/or our adrenals are fatigued. The pure healing magic of essential oils and plants in general never cease to amaze me. What do I want the world to know about my brand? I want people to know that healing is possible and that feeling grounded, loved and supported is for everyone, not just for those who can afford it. I offer sliding scale options and encourage those who need support to reach out. I also teach an online aromatherapy certification that takes students deep into the study and practice of consciously working with essential oils for emotional, spiritual and physical healing. If you had a friend visiting you, what are some of the local spots you'd want to take them around to? This is fun! I would have my friend join us in the summer, as it is my favorite time in the Vail Valley. I would plan for a dip at the Iron Mountain Hot Springs (Roaring Fork Valley) and a hike on Vail Mountain when the wild flowers are blooming. We would stop by for lunch at The Rose in Edwards, CO. Maybe a picnic at Nottingham Lake with some stand up paddle boarding. And hopefully having a burger and the perfect margarita made by Edgar at the Boneyard Bar and Grill (Eagle, CO) while we listen to music on the back patio and enjoy the beautiful views. The Shoutout series is all about recognizing that our success and where we are in life is at least somewhat thanks to the efforts, support, mentorship, love and encouragement of others. So is there someone that you want to dedicate your shoutout to? My teacher, Wendy De Rosa, has played a huge role in my current practice. I have been studying with her, and continue to learn from her still, as well as working as an Assistant in her Intuitive Healer Training Program. She is a teacher that embodies her work and walks the talk. Her guidance and program have given me a container to develop my gifts and encouraged me to put myself out there. I am incredibly grateful for her.
