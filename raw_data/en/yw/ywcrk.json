Once encountered with pathogens or antigens, the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system trigger a strong immune response to eliminate them from the system and protect the body. Thus, well-balanced immunity is pivotal for maintaining human health, as an insufficient level of immune defense leads to infections and tumors. In contrast, the excessive functioning of the immune system causes the development of autoimmune diseases and allergies. Strong immunity requires adequate nutrition, dietary interventions, and sufficient intake of certain vitamins (vitamin C, vitamin D, and folic acid) and minerals (magnesium, zinc, and selenium). Therefore, nutritional and micronutrient deficiencies lead to compromised immunity. Several natural ingredients have shown potent immunomodulatory properties. The immune-enhancing properties of many plants and fungi are due to containing bioactive phytoconstituents such as polyphenols, terpenoids, -glucans, vitamins, etc. Probiotics and prebiotics can be used as innovative tools to reduce intestinal inflammation and downregulate hypersensitivity reactions. Plant sources of melatonin, a multifunctional molecule with proven anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, have been discovered relatively recently. The bioactive compounds augment the immune response by directly increasing the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Many phytoconstituents prevent cell damage due to their powerful antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. The present review attempts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune-enhancing properties of some bioactive compounds from plants, fungi, animals, microorganisms, and other natural sources.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-04-01", "cleaned_text": "Natural Ingredients to Improve Immunity [https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16040528](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16040528) [Multi-Targeted Natural Products as Therapeutics]( /journal/pharmaceuticals/special_issues/93CN46HT0Q )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In recent decades, the rapid growth of the frequency of various infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, allergies, cancers, and autoimmune disorders has brought much suffering to human beings. At the beginning of the 21st century, Parkin and Cohen [ [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] summarized that an insufficient level of immune defense leads primarily to the occurrence of severe infections or/and tumors, while the excessive functioning of the immune system causes the development of allergic or/and autoimmune diseases. Thus, well-balanced immunity is pivotal for maintaining human health [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Therefore, the importance of using natural substances with immunomodulating properties to prevent or augment the treatment of the abovementioned conditions is becoming quite obvious [ [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. While innate immunity lacks immunological memory, it is a hallmark of adaptive immunity [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Many vitamins and minerals are also very effective in supporting the proper functioning of immunity [ [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The high cost of synthetic drugs, their anticipated toxicity, and various adverse effects are undesirable for patients. In contrast, herbal substances as health promoters have gained increasing attention in both scientific circles and among consumers [ [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Some medicinal plants can exhibit immunomodulatory effects such as phagocytosis promotion and macrophage activation, modulation cytokine secretion, immunoglobulin production, and lymphocyte proliferation [ [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In addition to the significant growth of interest in so-called superfoods (berries, nuts, green tea, sea products, and honey, among many others) in the era of the coronavirus pandemic [ [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)], COVID-19 has prompted a search for new effective natural remedies for immunomodulation to prevent this disease. Natural phytotherapeutics were regarded as effective immune boosters in the case of COVID-19 disease [ [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Despite the progressive successes in developing various vaccines against COVID-19, the importance of natural substances as immune-enhancing agents cannot be underestimated [ [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Recently, herbal medicines have been considered the drugs of choice to enhance immunity in pre- and post-COVID-19 patients [ [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The natural ingredients of garlic (Allium sativum) boost immunity by increasing the functions of innate immune system cells such as lymphocytes, -T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, which kill invading pathogens [ [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. -Glucans are a category of naturally derived ingredients (from some plants, fungi, and bacteria) that modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the immune response generated by -glucans varies based on the structure [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The appropriate intake of some polyphenols, vitamins, and minerals helps boost immune functions and fight infections, including COVID-19 [ [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The immune-boosting properties of flavonoids help fight cancer, inflammation, and viral infections [ [18](#B18-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Nowadays, scientists have concluded that using nanoformulations helps successfully solve the problem of poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability of some natural constituents quercetin, gingerol, etc. [ [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Nanodelivery of drugs makes it possible to provide targeted delivery of bioactive components and helps significantly reduce their dosage. [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Similarly, vitamin D increases the Th2 cell response and suppresses Th1 cell activation [ [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Overall, deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals can lead to the weakening of the immune system [ [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It should be also mentioned that propolis, a famous beekeeping product, is widely used for managing upper respiratory tract infections, which occur when the level of immunity decreases [ [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It is also worth adding that research in recent years has revealed that appropriate administration of the hormone melatonin plays a significant role in improving immunity [ [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 2. Medicinal Plants as Immunomodulators [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), For example, the immune-stimulating properties of Echinacea, ginger, and fresh citrus juice have been well-known worldwide for several decades [ [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [34](#B34-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [35](#B35-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In recent years, an increasing number of herbs with immunostimulating properties have been researched and discovered for official medicine based on the study of plant species from different parts of the globe. Herbal preparations are regarded as effective and inexpensive natural immunomodulators [ [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Williamson summarized that the molecular pharmacology of herbal drugs is a tremendous challenge, as phytoextracts are multicomponent substances with multileveled modes of action compared to synthetic pharmaceuticals [ [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] noted that modern approaches to medicine in the 21st century, as a rule, require the isolation and purification of one or two active compounds from medicinal plants. However, the isolation of an active compound could lead to the loss of its pharmacological activity [ [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. For instance, the effectiveness of multi-component herbal prescriptions in traditional Chinese medicine is highly appreciated by modern health care practitioners. It should be noted that individually, many of the ingredients in these combinations do not possess therapeutic activities because of the simultaneous and synergistic action of several bioactive compounds [ [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The modern technologies such as metabolomics, genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and computational strategies open the way for choosing better drug candidates with immunomodulatory effects extracted from medicinal plants [ [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [42](#B42-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It was found that phytoconstituents from such Coriander (Coriandrum sativum) was regarded as the most commonly used ingredient in homemade remedies in Sri Lanka during the COVID-19 pandemic [ [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Herbal preparations are regarded as effective and inexpensive natural immunomodulators [ [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Recent findings of Al Kury et al. [ [45](#B45-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] demonstrate that an extract from the aerial part of Xanthium spinosum (Asteraceae family) that unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids from plants sources also play an important role in the maintenance of immunity in the context of autoimmune and allergic diseases. [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Recently, Sun et al. [ [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] concluded that increased solubility, bioavailability, and efficacy of herbal formulations with immunomodulatory effects can be achieved using nano-engineered delivery systems. Chaudhary et al. [ [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] found that the synthesis of new antimicrobial drugs using 'green nanoparticles' from plant extracts has attracted a lot of attention from scientists in recent years. 2.1. Coneflower (Echinacea ssp.) [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Phytopreparations from the coneflower rhizome with roots or herbs are also widely used in the 21st century in the pharmaceutical industry. They are the best-selling herbal drugs in the USA and Europe as effective natural immunomodulators [ [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In addition to these phytoconstituents, several other bioactive chemicals have been identified in Echinacea species. Thus, their N-alkylamides also possess significant immunomopharmacological effects [ [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Primary metabolites such as polysaccharide arabinogalactan from E. purpurea could also enhance macrophage activation [ [52](#B52-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It was suggested that treatment with standardized Echinacea extracts at 2.4 g/day over 120 days is beneficial for prophylactic use and a dose of 4.0 g/day during acute stages of colds [ [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The extract from the fresh aerial part of E. purpurea (10-250 \u00b5g/mL) could effectively modulate the human [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Vimalanathan et al. [ [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] showed the broad antiviral actions of E. purpurea against SARS-CoV-2. Recently, Kolev et al. [ [56](#B56-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] demonstrated in randomized clinical studies the ability of E. purpurea hydroethanolic extract to prevent respiratory tract viral infections during the COVID-19 pandemic in the long term. 2.2. Artemisia afra/annua [57](#B57-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [58](#B58-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. A. afra also possesses powerful antimicrobial properties due to the presence of bioactive terpenoids. The essential oils of A. afra showed antimicrobial properties against 41 bacterial strains, indicating broad antimicrobial activity, which favors its use as a preservative in the food and cosmetic industries [ [59](#B59-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Three compounds of A. afra, scopoletin, betulinic acid, and acacetin, have shown potent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species and Candida albicans [ [60](#B60-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Appalasamy et al. reported the antimicrobial properties of A. annua. However, the compounds in A. annua were not found to be effective against Candida albicans [ [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The extract of A. annua also showed dose-dependent inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-) in activated neutrophils. At 25, 10, and 5 concentrations, A. annua inhibited TNF- secretion by 89%, 54%, and 38%, respectively. It also inhibited the secretion of prostaglandin E2 by activated neutrophils [ [62](#B62-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It is pertinent to mention that some studies have reported hepatotoxic effects of A. annua, where consumption of A. annua herbal tea was associated with acute cholestatic hepatitis. Therefore, the authors recommend its discontinuation for use in malaria due to its ineffectiveness and toxic effects on the liver [ [63](#B63-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. A 2012 report by the European Food Safety Authority classified several Artemisia species in a category that \"contain naturally occurring substances of possible concern for human health when used in food and food supplements.\" Moreover, the Medicine Control Council of South Africa has also banned the use of A. afra for the treatment of malaria due to its lack of efficacy [ [64](#B64-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 2.3. Ginseng (Panax ginseng) [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Many isolated ginsenosides (including Re, Rf, and Rg2) possess noticeable positive effects on innate and adaptive immunity [ [65](#B65-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [66](#B66-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [67](#B67-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [68](#B68-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Sun et al. demonstrated that oral administration of 200 and 400 mg/day ginseng polysaccharides in cyclophosphamide-induced immunocompromised mice significantly improved immunity by increasing NK cell cytotoxic activity and increasing the secretion of perforin and granzyme [ [69](#B69-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 2.4. Spices [70](#B70-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] demonstrated that four capsules of ginger extract (750 mg) were used daily for six weeks by obese women with breast neoplasms to reduce systemic inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Y\u00fccel et al. [ [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] described gingerols' anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory potential and their nanoformulations. The presence of a significant amount of eugenol in the essential oil as well as polyphenols (including apigenin, quercetin, and ferulic acid) in basil' or 'Tulsi' (Ocimum sanctum) from the Lamiaceae family could be the substantial reason for its excellent anti-inflammatory and immunostimulating activity [ [71](#B71-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The main biocompounds thiosulfinate compound [72](#B72-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. orally applied at doses of 3-9 mg/kg/day reduced parasitemia in mice infected with Plasmodium malaria and prolonged their survival by improving host immune responses [ [73](#B73-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The cumin (Nigella ssp.) seeds [74](#B74-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] that exhibit significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical trials revealed that Nigella seed oil has substantial potential to alleviate inflammation in the case of rheumatoid arthritis [ [74](#B74-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00528-f001)presents the most important medicinal plants and spices with immunomodulatory effects. 3. Selected Natural Compounds with Immunomodulating Properties [75](#B75-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Polyphenols can also reduce inflammation by suppressing proinflammatory cytokines and causing immunomodulatory effects against autoimmune diseases and allergic reactions [ [76](#B76-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. According to Mollazadeh et al. [ [77](#B77-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)], the positive effects of curcumin on human immunity could be related to its ability to increase IL-10-mediated effects. [78](#B78-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [79](#B79-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It contributes to a reduced respiratory tract infection risk [ [79](#B79-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 3.1. Quercetin [75](#B75-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), levels, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein in patients suffering from metabolic disorders. However, no effect on IL-6, TNF-, or high-density lipoprotein was observed [ [82](#B82-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. However, a randomized, crossover study in 20 athletes showed that intake of four quercetin-based chews 15 min before a 2 h run did not reduce post-exercise inflammation or immune changes caused by increased levels of various cytokines, such as GM-CSF, The four quercetin-based chews provided to runners were made using 1000 mg quercetin, 1000 mg vitamin C, 400 mg each of isoquercetin, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, 120 mg epigallocatechin 3-gallate, and 40 mg niacinamide. Although quercetin levels significantly increased in the quercetin-based chews group, no statistically significant difference was observed in the postexercise inflammation levels compared to the placebo group [ [83](#B83-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [84](#B84-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [Figure 2](#pharmaceuticals-16-00528-f002)presents an overview of the immunomodulatory properties quercetin and preparations from ginseng. 3.2. Propolis [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Propolis is recommended for managing upper respiratory tract infections, flu, colds, wound healing, fighting bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and treating acne or burns [ [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The antioxidant properties of propolis primarily contribute to its medicinal properties. A meta-analysis and systemic review of six studies with 406 participants concluded that propolis use significantly lowered serum TNF- and CRP levels in study participants [ [85](#B85-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 50 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients showed that the treated group receiving Iranian propolis (1000 mg/day) for 90 days showed a significant reduction in serum levels of CRP, TNF-, glycosylated hemoglobin, and insulin [ [86](#B86-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. A randomized, double-blind trial conducted in 60 elderly subjects (average age: 72.8 years) living at higher latitudes (2260 m above sea level) demonstrated that propolis intake (0.8 g; 24 months) significantly reduced serum IL-1 and IL-6 levels, but serum TNF- levels were not statistically significant. However, the propolis-treated group showed significantly higher levels of TGF-1 [ [87](#B87-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [88](#B88-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Diabetic foot is a major diabetes-associated complication. The use of propolis has been proposed to heal diabetic foot ulcers due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and wound-healing properties. A randomized trial conducted on 31 diabetic foot ulcer patients showed that propolis spray (3%) applied to wounds for eight weeks reduced the wound area by 4 cm2 and facilitated wound healing via increased tissue deposition at the wound site. [89](#B89-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. A meta-analysis of six studies comprising 406 participants demonstrated that propolis intake significantly reduced serum levels of CRP and TNF- [ [85](#B85-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted on 31 dengue hemorrhagic fever patients in Indonesia, patients were given two capsules of 200 mg of PropoelixTM three times a day for seven days. The PropoelixTM-treated group showed faster recovery, as evidenced by increased platelets compared to the placebo group. Moreover, the treated group had a significantly lower TNF- level on day seven than the placebo group. Overall, the treated group had lower hospitalization stays and better recovery [ [90](#B90-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 3.3. Glucans [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [60](#B60-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It was found that -glucan contains various types of glycosidic linkages, -(1,3)/-(1,4)/-(1,6), which vary depending on the source [ [91](#B91-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. -Glucans are a dietary source of soluble fermentable prebiotic fibers that provide a substrate for host microbiota within the large intestine, producing short-chain fatty acids and increasing fecal bulk. [92](#B92-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [93](#B93-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Water-insoluble -(13)-D-glucan extracted from G. and inhibiting IB and JNK1/2 phosphorylation. At the molecular level, the anti-inflammatory activity of -(13)-D-glucan was due to the inhibition of the NF-B and JNK MAPK pathways, with TLR2 receptors playing a central role [ [94](#B94-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [95](#B95-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In a similar observation, Murphy et al. reported that the extraction process of -glucans from the same source also creates a difference in immunomodulatory properties. In this study, the \"in-house\" extract of the edible mushroom (IHL) Lentinula edodes was compared with commercially available (Carbosynth-Lentinan, CL) lentinan extract. The CL extract is rich in -glucans and contains lower concentrations of -glucans. In human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, both IHL and CL extracts reduced NF-B activation at lower doses, but the IHL extract was more effective in lowering NF-B activation. However, the CL extract was more potent in inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2, TNF-, IL-22, IL-8, and the IHL extract. These findings demonstrate that -glucans from the same source can have different immunomodulatory and pulmonary protective properties, which may have implications for treating disorders caused by a cytokine storm in COVID-19 [ [96](#B96-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [97](#B97-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Gordon et al. reported that a combination of lentinan and didanosine increased the number of CD4 cells and neutrophil activity in some HIV patients [ [98](#B98-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [99](#B99-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In another study, the aqueous and Cordyceps militaris mushrooms containing -D-Glcp polysaccharides were studied for their immunomodulatory properties. The aqueous extracts stimulated the expression of various (TNF-, IL-1, COX-2) in THP-1 macrophages, while the alkaline extract did not elicit any immune response. However, alkaline did show potent anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-stimulated cells by inhibiting proinflammatory genes. Furthermore, the purified -(13)-D-glucan from C. militaris was the most potent anti-inflammatory agent under in vivo conditions and reduced the migration of total leucocytes but did not affect neutrophil migration [ [100](#B100-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. A clinical study conducted in healthy male adults (n = 39) demonstrated that capsules of C. militaris (dose: 1.5 g/day, 4 weeks) significantly enhanced cell-mediated immunity. The treated group displayed higher NK cell activity and lymphocyte proliferation index and induced the secretion of IFN- by Th1 cells compared to the placebo group. Therefore, C. militaris effectively enhanced cell-mediated immunity in adults without causing side effects [ [101](#B101-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [102](#B102-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus cornucopiae) containing a -glucan concentration of 24 mg/meal for eight weeks increased the serum levels of IFN- and IL-12, whereas IL-10 and IL-13 did not change considerably. Moreover, the treated group showed increased activity of NK cells. It may help fight infection and cancer due to its immune-boosting properties [ [103](#B103-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [Figure 3](#pharmaceuticals-16-00528-f003)presents an overview of properties of propolis and -glucans. 3.4. Melatonin [104](#B104-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It is a hormone that is an indole derivative of serotonin [ [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [105](#B105-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [106](#B106-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The richest the Coffea arabica (6800 ng/g) and black pepper (1093 ng/g) [ [106](#B106-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It has been found also in cherries, grapes, pistachio, olives, walnuts, tomatoes, maize, rice, and some longa, Tanacetum parthenium, Hypericum perforatum, etc.). [107](#B107-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Reviews highlight the important role of melatonin as a potential adjuvant in the treatment of COVID-19 due to its ability to influence mechanisms that alter immune regulation; melatonin has been included as a preventive and therapeutic option against COVID-19 along with vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium [ [108](#B108-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. These nutrients show synergistic effects and play a central role in maintaining the function and integrity of the immune system, so even a minor deficiency can impair metabolism and immune responses [ [105](#B105-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [109](#B109-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [110](#B110-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Considering the high effectiveness of oral melatonin as an adjuvant therapy added to standard treatment, the safety, and availability of the drug, it is suggested to conduct additional studies with larger sample sizes and longer observation periods on the use of melatonin for the prevention of complications and the treatment of COVID-19 patients of varying degrees of severity. 4. Micronutrients: Vitamins and Minerals [111](#B111-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Some dietary micronutrients have been recognized as key components of the world-famous Mediterranean diet [ [112](#B112-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Each stage of an adequate immune response requires many specific elements, including zinc, selenium, magnesium, and vitamins, which play vital, often synergistic roles. As is known, many vitamins can be obtained from natural sources. For instance, a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables contain high amounts of vitamin C. However, some vitamins have a synthetic origin nowadays. [113](#B113-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. As it was revealed recently, micronutrients are important immunomodulatory tools for COVID-19 management [ [75](#B75-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 4.1. Vitamin C [114](#B114-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. For example, vitamin C from fresh fruits and vegetables reduces cellular oxidative stress, improves immune functions by enhancing innate and adaptive immune responses, and acts as a cofactor for several enzymatic reactions. Moreover, the accumulation of vitamin C in neutrophils enhances chemotaxis and phagocytosis activity, leading to the killing of bacterial cells. It also promotes the clearance of spent neutrophils from the infection site and prevents tissue damage [ [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The preventive role of vitamin C in the common cold is well documented. Studies have shown that vitamin C supplements (1-2 g/day) reduce the severity of the common cold in children and adults. [115](#B115-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In a randomized clinical trial conducted in 200 patients, supplementation with vitamin C and vitamin E in combination with triple therapy of antibiotics (lansoprazole + amoxicillin + clarithromycin) for 14 days increased the clearance rate of Helicobacter pylori by increasing antibiotic effectiveness and augmenting immune functions [ [116](#B116-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [117](#B117-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 4.2. Vitamin D [118](#B118-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, exerts anti-inflammatory effects through the presence of immune cells, including B and T cells, DCs, and macrophages expressing the vitamin D receptor and 1-hydroxylase. It was found a significant association between vitamin D deficiency and increased incidence or exacerbation of infectious diseases and inflammatory autoimmune diseases. However, the impact of vitamin D on the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases and the relationship between inflammatory diseases and vitamin D are still controversial [ [119](#B119-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [120](#B120-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [121](#B121-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In a study involving 100 participants (50 with COVID-19 and 50 healthy subjects), it was noted that patients with COVID-19 had significantly lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels than healthy controls 32.06 \u00b1 17.22, numbers of lymphocytes, TCD4+, TCD8+, and NK cells were significantly decreased in patients with COVID-19 (p < 0.0001), and IL-12, IFN-, and TNF- were significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 compared to controls. In contrast, IFN- was reduced in the COVID-19 group; these data suggest a possible relationship between vitamin D concentration, immune system function, and risk of infection with COVID-19 [ [122](#B122-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [111](#B111-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Interestingly, vitamin D receptors and other related enzymes are expressed by both innate and adaptive systems, probably explaining the immunomodulatory properties of vitamin D. Therefore, vitamin D deficiency is often linked with allergies, infections, and autoimmune disorders [ [123](#B123-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [104](#B104-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. In a clinical trial, sarcopenia patients aged 65 were given 20 g of whey protein, 3 g of leucine, and 800 IU of vitamin D twice daily for 13 weeks. After the intervention period, IL-6 and IL-1Ra levels increased, but IL-8 levels were reduced. The study concluded that vitamin D and whey protein supplementation may reduce the immune response in sarcopenia patients [ [124](#B124-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [125](#B125-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 4.3. Folic Acid [126](#B126-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [127](#B127-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. A study that identified key genes and effective compounds through the analysis of effective compounds and drug targets against COVID-19 showed that folic acid acts on SARS-CoV-2 N through molecular docking and antagonizes the inhibitory effect of the protein on the RNA interference pathway, which is the perspective of the therapeutic use of FC supplements [ [128](#B128-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Importantly, these results were confirmed by the more severe clinical course of COVID-19 and the worse outcomes associated with micronutrient deficiencies, especially low levels of folic acid [ [129](#B129-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. However, isolated clinical folic acid deficiency cases are extremely rare; most of the symptoms coincide with cobalamin deficiency; the proliferative effects of folic acid may increase the risk of cancer [ [130](#B130-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]; it is suggested to follow practical advice on micronutrient provision and monitoring during nutritional support [ [131](#B131-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. To conclude, knowledge of the main mechanisms of the interaction between the virus and the host has expanded the use of folic acid supplementation and the opportunities for developing new medications. 4.4. Magnesium [132](#B132-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Hypomagnesemia can lead to various chronic inflammatory diseases [ [76](#B76-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [133](#B133-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. According to the results of this study, magnesium levels were lower in patients with more severe symptoms of COVID-19, and the median magnesium level in patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 was 38.33 mg/L. In contrast, the median magnesium level in the group with mild symptoms was 39.46 mg/L, giving a p value of 0.002 between the two groups. This study shows that higher magnesium levels may protect against severe symptoms of COVID-19 [ [134](#B134-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Mechanisms include its calcium channel-blocking effects, which lead to inhibition of interleukin-6, CRP, nuclear factor K, and other potentially disruptive factors. In addition, magnesium deficiency is associated with increased IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine and a likely target for the treatment of COVID-19 [ [135](#B135-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [136](#B136-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [137](#B137-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [138](#B138-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. As it was observed by Fiorentini et al. [ [138](#B138-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)], toxic hypermagnesemia occurred if oral magnesium doses were higher than 2500 mg/day. Generally, magnesium was regarded as a safe and cost-effective mineral that could help restore the damaged homeostatic equilibrium of the human body [ [137](#B137-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 4.5. Zinc [139](#B139-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The richest source of zinc is found in foods obtained from animals, such as seafood, meat, and milk products [ [140](#B140-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Some cereal-based products and vegetables were also regarded as appropriate natural sources of zinc. A meta-analysis and systematic review conducted by Jafari et al. aimed to investigate the effect of zinc supplementation on immune factors in a total of 35 randomized controlled trials with 1995 participants. It was observed a significant decrease in circulating serum CRP (weighted mean difference (WMD): 32.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): from 44.45 to 19.62, p < 0.001), high sensitivity C reactive protein concentrations (WMD: 0.95; from 1.01 to mean difference 95% [141](#B141-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [142](#B142-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [143](#B143-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [144](#B144-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. A randomized controlled trial in children (n = 512) aged 6-23 months demonstrated that zinc supplementation (7 mg/day) combined with a multiple micronutrient powder for nine months did not affect cytokine secretion or the number of T cells. However, zinc supplementation altered the numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils [ [145](#B145-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Daily ingestion of zinc supplements (40 mg/day in adults) was generally considered safe [ [146](#B146-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [147](#B147-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. 4.6. Selenium [148](#B148-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Selenium may be a potential agent for preventing viral infections, including coronavirus, according to the mechanism of enhancing the proliferation of NK cells. T-lymphocytes also have a positive effect in combination with vitamins D and E [ [149](#B149-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Considering that increased oxidative stress and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines are critical components of coronavirus disease, selenium reduces the level of viral infection, reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, strengthens the immune system, and is necessary for critically ill patients. Moreover, selenium deficiency is often associated with the severity and mortality of the disease, providing new insight into the relationship between selenium deficiency and the severity of COVID-19 [ [150](#B150-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [151](#B151-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [152](#B152-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The main sources of organic selenium are beef/sheep liver, red meats, poultry, eggs, seafood, dairy products, some fungi, brazil nuts, broccoli, and whole grain foods [ [111](#B111-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. WHO recommends that the daily intake of selenium by adults should be 40-70 \u00b5g/day, depending on body condition and gender (weight, pregnancy in women, etc.) [ [111](#B111-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It should be noted that selenium in doses above 400 \u00b5g/day demonstrates harmful actions [ [149](#B149-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Recently, Vahidi et al. [ [153](#B153-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)], during a study of the anticancer properties of selenium, concluded that its nano-formulations could be developed for targeted delivery to tumors and that they would significantly decrease the dosage of selenium to minimize the possible adverse effects. 5. Probiotics, Prebiotics, Synbiotics, and Immunity [154](#B154-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The first records of ingestion of live bacteria by humans were over 2000 years old. Prebiotics have been defined as nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species already resident in the colon and thus attempt to improve host health [ [155](#B155-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Various molecules can be prebiotics, but most are dietary fibers. They serve as substrates for probiotic commensal bacteria that release short-chain fatty acids in the intestinal tract along with some other metabolites. A synbiotic contains both prebiotics and probiotics, which can stimulate and increase the survival of autochthonous microbiota and probiotic bacteria, particularly lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. [156](#B156-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Lactobacillus strains can enhance the humoral immune response to infections [ [157](#B157-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] and vaccination [ [158](#B158-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [159](#B159-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Probiotics promote the digestion and absorption of nutrients and maintain gut microbiota homeostasis. As beneficial natural inhabitants of the human microbiome, probiotics play an important role in producing various nutrients, preventing infectious diseases caused by intestinal pathogens, and modulating the immune response [ [160](#B160-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Probiotics are chosen as alternatives because they act as natural immune enhancers [ [161](#B161-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The mechanisms by which probiotic strains modulate the immune response are not completely known. Probiotics affect innate immunity by preventing bacterial adherence and translocation and improving the mechanisms of pathogen destruction. Prevention of the initial step of tissue colonization by pathogens may improve the treatment of some infectious diseases. For example, Saccharomyces boulardii significantly reduces some adverse effects of Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy by preventing adherence of this pathogen to the mucous membrane of the stomach [ [162](#B162-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [163](#B163-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Species from the genus Lactobacillus release various bacteriocins that inhibit taxonomically related gram-positive bacteria. Some are active against a much wider range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and molds. Adhesion and invasion of an intestinal epithelial cell line (Intestine 407) by adherent invasive E. coli isolated from patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were substantially diminished by co- or pre-incubation with the probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 [ [164](#B164-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. E. coli Nissle is known to secrete microcins to antagonize its competitors [ [165](#B165-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. These findings have shown that probiotics avert epithelial injury induced by pathogenic bacteria, contribute to an improved mucosal barrier, and limit enteric pathogen access. [166](#B166-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. It was investigated and found that flagellin is the major stimulatory factor of E. coli Nissle 1917 [ [164](#B164-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [167](#B167-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)], possibly related to alterations in mitogen-activated protein kinases and pattern recognition receptor pathways. Probiotics can also inhibit the binding of LPS to the CD14 receptor, reducing the overall activation of NF- and produce proinflammatory cytokines [ [168](#B168-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Kim et al. showed that conjugated linoleic acids produced by probiotics interact with IkB kinase and heat shock protein 90 to activate the NF-kB signaling pathway in human gastric epithelial cells infected with H. pylori [ [169](#B169-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Lv et al. have shown that probiotics generally cannot eliminate H. pylori, although they decrease the density of colonization, thereby maintaining lower levels of H. pylori in the stomach [ [170](#B170-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [171](#B171-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Thus, reinfections can be partly prevented by probiotic intestinal cell-mediated responses. Pediococcus acidilactici K15, as well as LAB, was found to be the most effective in inducing IgAs, which are mainly induced via IL-10, as well as IL-6, secreted by K15-stimulated dendritic cells. In a clinical trial, an increase in salivary sIgA concentration by K15 ingestion was confirmed [ [172](#B172-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The health benefits ascribed to one strain of probiotic may not be obligatory when applied to another strain [ [173](#B173-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. D\u00edaz-Ropero et al. showed that the consumption of L. fermentum CECT5716 enhanced the production of Th1 cytokines by spleen cells and increased the IgA concentration in feces. Therefore, this probiotic has an immunostimulatory effect. However, the consumption of L. salivarius CECT 5713 induced IL-10 production by spleen cells, demonstrating anti-inflammatory effect [ [174](#B174-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [175](#B175-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The prominent probiotic Escherichia coli NISSLE 1917 is used in the treatment of intestinal diseases such as diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease because it has high adhesive properties and demonstrates immunomodulation and anti-inflammation abilities [ [176](#B176-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The effects of Bifidobacterium infantis supplementation in an inflammatory bowel disease mouse model demonstrated relief of intestinal epithelial injury and increased production of cytokines, such as transforming TGF-1, IL-10, and IL-35, which play an immunosuppressive role in maintaining the body's immune tolerance [ [177](#B177-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The research of Xiao Joe et al. using principal component analysis and cluster analysis heatmaps showed that the novel candidate probiotic mixture is effective against the nervous necrosis virus as a consequence of stimulation of innate and adaptive immunity [ [178](#B178-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Probiotics from the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera have exhibited feasible antiviral activities against rotavirus [ [179](#B179-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] and enterovirus [ [180](#B180-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Randomized controlled trials found that supplementation with probiotics or prebiotics as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 might positively affect the outcome of COVID-19, and improvements in fatigue, anosmia, breathlessness, nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms were reported [ [181](#B181-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [182](#B182-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The administration of probiotics in the diet of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms related to COVID-19 and those with mild-to-moderate systemic symptoms can be an alternative for preventing cytokine storms [ [182](#B182-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [183](#B183-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Intestinal DCs are located within gut-associated lymphoid tissue and express pattern recognition receptors such as TLR-2 and TLR-4. Prebiotics or their fermentation byproducts can bind to these receptors and trigger the maturation process involving upregulation or downregulation of membrane CD83, CD86, HLA-DR, and DC-SIGN molecules and induce the secretion of cytokines. The activation of DCs through particular pattern recognition and immunity receptors defines the polarization of effector T cells to either the T-helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, or Treg phenotype [ authors showed that butyrate, acetate, and soybean oligosaccharides could enhance the activity of NK cells in comparison with the control group [ [185](#B185-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [186](#B186-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The symbiotic combination of enriched inulin with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 enhanced NK cell activity in the blood [ [185](#B185-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Studies in poultry flocks indicated that the probiotic strain Enterococcus faecium combined with prebiotics inulin and fructooligosaccharides might inhibit pathogen proliferation, insomuch as significantly extending the lag time for pathogenic E. coli O1/O18 and Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis strains [ [187](#B187-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [188](#B188-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Probiotics are a priori nonpathogenic; therefore, they are never supposed to cause or potentiate any disease in humans. The safety of medicinal probiotics is still being discussed. The safety of probiotics was confirmed as apparent due to the absence of toxicity by randomized trials in different target populations, conditions, and age groups in a specific clinical scenario majority of human clinical studies, probiotic dosages typically range between 107 and 1011 colony-forming units /day. The appropriate dose, duration, and composition of a synbiotic needed to confer a health benefit are likely to be specific to outcome and baseline host target site microbiota, as well as coexisting environmental factors such as medication, habitual diet, and host genetic factors [ [198](#B198-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. [199](#B199-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] that they might have some side effects, and safety issues may arise due to the use of living microbial cells [ [200](#B200-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The topic of probiotic safety is still being discussed [ [201](#B201-pharmaceuticals-16-00528), [202](#B202-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Evidence from clinical trials is mixed and controversial [ [194](#B194-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. The long-term colonizing probiotics have potential risks, such as that the probiotic could displace a microbe performing an important function; negatively impact the structure and function of the surrounding microbiota; and if the normal gut barrier is breached, the probiotic could access the systemic circulation, resulting in invasive infection [ [203](#B203-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Suez J. and colleagues [ [204](#B204-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)] found that resident gut bacteria in a subset of individuals resist the mucosal presence of probiotic strains, limiting their modulatory effect on the microbiome. Evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse. The elicited cytokine production via probiotic supplementation might cause inordinate immunological effects. Theoretically, probiotic administration might lead to auto-immune disease development or certain inflammations [ [205](#B205-pharmaceuticals-16-00528)]. Building a strong safety profile for probiotic strains will solidify their use in individuals that can benefit the most from microbial modulation. 6.
