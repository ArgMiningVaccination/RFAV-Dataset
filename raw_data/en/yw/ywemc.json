We appreciate the c ommittee 's consideration of our previously submitted comments. There continues to be a need for more transparency regarding drug pricing. T his bill will help shed light on the \"black box\" that drug manufacturers are permitted to operate in with respect to their pricing. The bill will facilitate the disclosure of some of the data needed to address and understand why prescription drug prices continually increase, many times in very dramatic ways. When considering drug price transparency measures, we support legislation that adheres to the following principles : The measure l imits the disclosure of proprietary or trade secret data and limits publication of data that is non- public, or that is unrelated to the price of the prescription drug. The measure place s pharmaceutical manufacturers on similar footing with respect to financial disclosures as other sectors of the health care industry. The measure provides advance notification of excessive significant drug price increases by pharmaceutical manufacturers. To this end, we view that proposed draft language as a first step to provide much- needed transparency in this market. As we shared in previous letters, several states Page 2 of 3 have already enacted legislation imposing similar reporting requirements , and reporting in those states has begun to yield interesting insights. For example, Oregon's 2019 \"Insurer Reports on Prescription Drugs Drug Price Transparency Program\" documented that Humira, a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, topped both the list of the top 25 costliest prescriptions and the greatest increase to plan spending.1 Only armed with information of this kind can stakeholders begin to understand the real impact that prescription drug spending has on health care affordability . With respect to the current draft of the bill before the committee, we request the following changes that are necessary to strengthen these important consumer protections : We request that the bill mandate submission of health insurer information to the Insurance Department (Department) rather than the Board of Pharmacy. Carriers are accustomed to submitt ing data to the Department , and the D epartment has a mechanism in place to receive carrier information. I t is also critical that competitive and proprietary information be protected. The Board of Pharmacy is comprised of engaged and active market participants whose access to sensitive market data could result in a conflict of interest. Additionally, we request that the penalties section of the bill be amended with respect to insurers . The Department already has broad authority over carriers , including the ability to levy fines and even revoke licensure in some cases. T hus, we do not believe levying civil penalties is necessary to ensure compliance. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important matter. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at sorrange@ahip.org , (703 -887-5285). Sincerely, Regional Director, State Affairs America's Health Insurance Plans i AHIP is the national association whose members provide insurance coverage for health care and related services.

August 26 , 2020 The Honorable George Keiser, Chair Health Care Committee North Dakota State Legislature State Capitol 600 East Boulevard Bismarck, ND 58505 Dear Chair man Keiser and Committee Members: Cigna is a national health insurance provider that has been on the front lines of providing patient access and coverage during the COVID -19 pandemic. Express Scripts is a pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) that cares for over 80 million lives in the Uni ted States. Together, Cigna and Express Scripts have created a new health services leader. The combined companies are increasing predictability, choice, affordabili ty and access to quality care through connected, personalized solutions that advance better health outcomes. We appreciate the ability to submit comments on the three bill drafts the committee is considering . Prescription Drug Cost Transparency : We support the suggested language changes as proposed by PCMA. We believe that it is imperative that the Insurance Commission er, as the regulator, collect and aggregate the data instead of the Board of Pharmacy. The Department of Insurance is well -situated to handle such competitive data. The highly sensitive and proprietary information is best collected by th e enforcement agency. Additionally, s pecific to the \"disclosure of pharmacy benefit manager information\" section, we have concerns w ith the April 1st deadline. R ebates are paid -out to clients on varying schedules, typically after a quarter ends. Therefore on or before April 1, we would only be able to provide the information reque sted through the third quarter; thus, there would be a need for a restated report in July to provide a full picture of the preceding calendar year. This same date change would be requested for the \"disclosure of health insurer spending information\" section as well. We would support changing the reporting da te to July 1 to ensure we can provide a comprehensive report to the State. Prescribing of Biosimilar Drugs : We support the revisions made to the bill as they will remove barriers to the use of biosimilar medications. The language pertaining to notificati on has been adopted in other states and modifies the current notification requirement so that it can be done by electronic means. Guaranteed Issue : The Association of Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) has drafted language to address guaranteed issue as states continue to consider this. This language addresses the committee's intent in ensuring pre -existing conditions are not a barrier to affordable insurance coverage. A stable marketplace will incentivize broad enrollment in continuous coverage while m aintaining a balanced risk pool. I would encourage the committee to consider this language as you move forward. Sincerely, Margaret Reynolds, State Government Affairs Principal 900 Cottage Grove Road, B6LPA Bloomfield, CT 06002 651-341-3161 margaret.reynolds@Cigna.com Margaret Reynolds State Government Affairs Principal August 14, 2020 SENT VIA EMAIL: gkeiser@nd.gov The Honorable George Keiser , Chair man Health Care Committee North Dakota State Legislature State Capitol 600 East Boulevard Bismarck , ND 58505 RE: Comments on Draft Bills Relative to Prescribing of Biosimilar Drugs and Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Dear Chairman Keiser: On behalf of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), I appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on the draft bills from the November 2019 meeting relative to the Prescribing of Biosimilar Drug s and Prescription Drug Cost Transparency. P CMA is the national trade association for PBMs, which administer prescription drug plans for more than 266 million Americans with health coverage provided by large and small employers, health insurers, labor unions, and federal and state -sponsored health p rograms. Prescribing of Biosimilar Drug s PCMA supports, and is encouraged by, the North Dakota Legislative Health Care Committee's proposed revisions to the biosimilar drug dispensing statute. These revisions meet the stated goal of removing barriers to t he use of biosimilar medications. The language pertaining to notification in the November draft is what has been adopted in the vast majority of the country and modifies the current notification requirement so it can be done via various mean s, including el ectronic transmissions . Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill Draft PCMA supports meaningful transparency across the supply chain, including transparency that empowers patients, prescribers, clients, and policymakers to make informed decisions that lead to optimal health outcomes and lower costs. PBMs provide patients and physicians with real -time electronic tools to determine formulary coverage and cost -sharing at the point of prescribing. We also feel the need to ensure the protection of competitive and proprietary financial information. Therefore, we are very concerned about the data being collected by the Board of Pharmacy. The FTC issued a letter on this issue when the Mississippi legislature passed a law grant ing the Board of Pharmacy with the authority to regulate PBMs. The Honorable George Keiser , Chair man Health Care Committee August 14, 2020 Page 2 \"[b]ecause pharmacists and PBMs have a competitive, and at times, adversarial relationship, we are concerned that giving the pharmacy board regulatory power over PBMs may create tensions and c onflicts of interest for the pharmacy board.\"1 Similarly, t he FTC has opposed regulatory boards composed of market participants in other industries. In North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission, the United States Supreme Court looked into the question as to whether the state board could decide that a certain procedure could only be performed under the supervision of a dentist, thereby driving lower priced non -dentists out of the market. The FTC questioned the North Caroli na Board of Dental Examiners' ability to regulate an industry in which they were active participants noting, 'common sense and economic theory.... dictate the conclusion that Board actions in this area could be self interested\" 2 We believe that the Depart ment of Insurance would be the appropriate agency for such competitive data. The Board of Pharmacy is comprised of active market participants whose access to market sensitive data could result in a conflict of interest and undermine competition in the pres cription drug marketplace . The industry worked with various stakeholders in Texas throughout the process there to amend similar language on disclosure. A key amendment included in the final passage of Texas HB 2536 aggregates the rebate information reported by PBMs and health plans before publishing the data. This important clarification protects proprietary, private business and competitively sensitive information. PCMA respectfully requests the insertion of similar language such as the following : \"The Insurance C ommissioner shall collect and aggregate all the collected data and publish the aggregated data from all reports for that year required by this section in an appropriate location on the department's Internet website. The combined aggregated data from the reports must be published in a manner that does not disclose or tend to disclose proprietary or confidential information of any pharmacy benefit manager or health plan [Carrier/Insurer]\" in the section entitled \"Disclosure of p harmacy benefit manager information \" and the section entitled \"Disclosure of health insurer spending information\" . PCMA also suggests the following language be included so the data submitted to the Department of Insurance is not subject to open records requests, except for the aggregated and de- identified data that is in the published report. Rulemaking - Forms - Services - Records. 4. A report received by the board commissioner is an exempt a confidential record as defined by section 44- 04-17.1. 1 FTC letter to Representative Mark Formby, Mississippi House of Representatives, (March 22, 2011). 2 Emory University School of Law, \"Legal Studies Research Paper Series\". Joanna Shepherd 2013 The Honorable George Keiser , Chair man Health Care Committee August 14, 2020 Page 3 North Dakota open records laws have three classes of public records . Given the sensitive nature of the information within this bill's scope, it is more properly deemed \"confidential information\" rather than \"exempt record.\" In addition, PCMA respectfully request s the section involving penalties be either updated or removed from the proposed legislation. If anything, administrative penalties imposed by the regulator would be more appropriate to levy than criminal penalties. Drug manufacturers are responsible for setting the list price of drugs. No evidence exists to suggest that rebates cause higher drug prices. A study of list prices and rebates for the top 200 most prescribed drugs between 2011 and 2016 indicated that there is no correlation between rebates and list price increases or launch prices for individual drugs.3 Of these drugs, there were prices that increased significantly, some that increased slightly, and some rebates that were high, and some that were low. Top brand drugs that offered little to no commercial s ector rebate during this time period still increased their prices, and manufacturers are increasing drug prices regardless of rebate levels negotiated by PBMs. Among the top 200 brand drugs by 2016 sales, the launch prices for drugs introduced from 2012 to 2016 were double the launch prices for those introduced prior to 2012. There was no correlation found between the prices and rebates. Again, pharmaceutical manufacturer s set drug prices. Therefore, the language on page 3 beginning on line 18 relating to the factors that led to drug price increase will likely yield better information if the language is amended to read as follows: \"a definitive statement regarding the factor or factors that caused the increase in the wholesale acquisition cost and an explanation of the role of each factor's impact on the cost.\" PCMA requests that the due date for annual data collection be changed to July 1 to ensure comprehensive reporting of information for the preceding calendar year. This request will allow for a complete and accurate accounting of information that by its nature lags at least one quarter behind. Stated differently, w hile information can be reported on April 1 of each year, it will not represent complete information for the preceding calendar year. PBMs negotiate on behalf of their clients and consumers to help drive down the cost of prescription drugs by using market -based tools that encourage competition among drugmakers and drugstores. PBMs support and practice transparency that empowers patients, their providers, plan sponsors, and policymakers, so that there is informed decision- making that can lead to lower prescription drug costs. We appreciate your inte rest and commitment to keeping the costs of drugs affordable for the 3 Increasing Prices Set by Drugmakers Not Correlated with Rebates, Analysis prepared by Visante on behalf of George Keiser , Chair man Health Care Committee August 14, 2020 Page 4 citizens of North Dakota and look forward to working with you in your efforts to pass meaningful legislation.

As I explain in this Article, however, new regulatory developments in some states threaten to undercut competition in the PBM industry and disrupt the cost-savings PBMs currently generate. The regulatory scheme that was adopted by Mississippi in 2011, and that is currently under legislative consideration in several other states, shifts regulatory control of PBMs from the neutral Insurance Commissions to the states' Boards of Pharmacy. The fundamental problem with this structure is that the Boards of Pharmacy are made up of pharmacists, the direct market adversaries of PBMs. In several different areas of the prescription drug market, PBMs and pharmacists are in direct competition over profits. Thus, the pharmacist-controlled Boards of Pharmacy have both the incentive and the opportunity to exert their regulatory authority in ways that benefit pharmacies at the expense of PBMs; reductions in PBMs' profits generally lead to more profits for pharmacists. Indeed, I describe two important regulatory changes that the Board has enacted in its first two years that harm PBMs and benefit pharmacies. The power to regulate a market adversary gives pharmacists unprecedented power and will undercut competition in the prescription drug market. I explain how this regulatory scheme will not only hurt the PBM industry, but will also increase the prices that consumers and third parties pay for prescription drugs .

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2Although most people have never heard of a \"pharmacy benefit manager,\" 95% of insured Americans have prescription drug coverage that is administered by one.2 Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) act as the middlemen among pharmacies, drug manufacturers, insurers, and consumers with prescription drug coverage. They influence how much consumers pay for drugs, which pharmacies they use, and even which drugs they take. By negotiating discounts with pharmacies and manufacturers, substituting less expensive drug alternatives when appropriate, and filling prescriptions for chronic conditions by mail, PBMs save consumers and third parties that pay for prescription drugs billions of dollars each year.3 However, recent regulatory developments in some states threaten to disrupt the PBM industry and the cost savings they currently produce for consumers of prescription drugs. The regulatory scheme currently in place in Mississippi-- and under legislative consideration in several other states--gives regulatory control over PBMs to the states' Boards of Pharmacy. Although this regulatory scheme is innocuous on its face, pharmacists--who serve on the Boards of Pharmacy--are market adversaries of PBMs. In several different areas of the prescription drug market, PBMs and pharmacists are in direct competition over profits. Thus, the pharmacist-controlled Boards of Pharmacy have both the incentive and the opportunity to exert their regulatory authority in ways that benefit pharmacies at the expense of PBMs. Indeed, although the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy has only had regulatory authority over PBMs for a little over a year, examples of regulations that harm PBMs have already emerged. Unfortunately, this regulatory scheme will do more than just hurt the PBM industry, it will also increase the prices that consumers and third parties pay for prescription drugs. PBMs administer the prescription drug benefits for health plan sponsors such as employers, labor unions, and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). PBMs engage in various activities to manage their clients' prescription drug benefit efficacy and costs. For example, PBMs negotiate discounts on prescription drug prices from pharmacies in exchange for the pharmacy's placement on the preferred network for plan participants. PBMs also negotiate discounts and payments from drug manufacturers in exchange for the manufacturers' drugs placement on the preferred list of medication for various ailments. In addition, PBMs interact electronically with pharmacists that are filling prescriptions to substitute generic drug substitutes or lower-priced alternatives when *3 appropriate. These practices that are central to the PBM business model produce lower prices for prescription drugs. Indeed, research shows that consumers with PBM-administered prescription drug coverage pay between 15% and 50% less for drugs than do non-insured customers buying the exact same drugs.4 Yet, despite evidence of the significant cost savings that PBMs generate for consumers and health plan sponsors, critics of the PBM industry have successfully lobbied state legislatures for increased regulation of these companies in recent years. These regulations include a variety of rules related to licensing, investigations, duties to clients, disclosures of financial terms with manufacturers, and the extent to which savings must be passed on to consumers. Until 2011, despite the various regulatory schemes, all states gave regulatory authority over PBMs to a neutral insurance commission. In 2011, Mississippi became the first and only state to shift regulatory authority over PBMs from the Insurance Commission to the Board of Pharmacy. The Board of Pharmacy is composed entirely of pharmacists.5 Legislatures in Oregon, Hawaii, and Oklahoma are currently considering proposals to allow the state Boards of Pharmacy to regulate PBMs. In the last legislative session, Washington, New Hampshire, Alabama, and Louisiana considered similar proposals. The fundamental problem with this regulatory scheme is that PBMs are the direct market adversaries of pharmacies in several segments of the prescription drug market. For example, when PBMs negotiate price discounts for prescription drugs at network pharmacies, they put direct pressure on the profits of both network and non-network pharmacies. In addition, when PBMs attract customers to mail-order pharmacies with lower drug costs, they reduce the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies. Granting Boards of Pharmacy regulatory control over PBMs creates an inherent conflict of interest by giving pharmacists regulatory control over their natural competitors in the marketplace. Under this new regulatory scheme, a Board has both the incentive and the power to exercise its regulatory power in ways that weaken PBMs' competitive positions, and in turn, benefit pharmacies. The power to regulate a market adversary gives pharmacists unprecedented power and will severely undercut competition in the prescription drug market. Moreover, this regulatory scheme will increase the prices of prescription drugs for both consumers and health plan sponsors.THE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3Even though the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy has only had regulatory authority over PBMs for a little over a year, two regulations have already emerged that harm PBMs and benefit pharmacies. First, the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy has the power both to require PBMs to turn over sensitive financial information and to share that information with pharmacies. This practice will benefit pharmacies by giving them business information about their market adversaries and it will weaken the PBM industry and produce significant harms for consumers and health plan sponsors. Second, on January 23, 2013, the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy enacted a rule imposing a fiduciary duty on PBMs. PBMs' new fiduciary status will compel them to adopt certain defensive measures, curb various cost-saving practices, incur additional *4 legal and administrative costs, and increase the reporting of sensitive business information. As a result of these changes, the cost of prescription drug coverage administered by PBMs will increase. Moreover, many of the consequences of a fiduciary duty will undermine PBMs' competitive positions in the prescription drug market relative to retail pharmacies that do not have fiduciary status. Thus, the newest regulation further demonstrates that the Board is utilizing its regulatory authority to disadvantage PBMs while benefitting pharmacies. This Article proceeds as follows. In Section I, I describe the role of PBMs in administering prescription drug coverage and the structure of the PBM industry. I also discuss empirical evidence that shows that PBMs produce significant benefits to consumers and health plan sponsors by lowering both the prices of prescription drugs and the cost of prescription drug coverage. In Section II, I discuss the specific arguments that critics make in their demands for more regulation of the PBM industry and the empirical evidence showing that more regulation is unnecessary. I also briefly describe the history of federal and state regulatory efforts toward the PBM industry. In Section III, I discuss the existing regulatory scheme in Mississippi and the current proposals in Oregon, Hawaii, and Oklahoma to grant Boards of Pharmacy regulatory authority over PBMs. Then, I present an economic analysis of these approaches and explain why granting regulatory authority to a market adversary will undercut competition in the prescription drug market. As a result of these approaches, both consumers and health plan sponsors will pay more for prescription drugs and prescription drug coverage. I. BACKGROUND ON PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS Many private sector entities that offer medical insurance also offer prescription drug coverage to their members. These health plan sponsors may include employers, labor unions, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), and other entities. Health plan sponsors often hire PBMs to manage prescription drug benefits for their members. Ninety-five percent of Americans with prescription drug coverage receive their benefits through a PBM.6 In this section, I describe the role of PBMs in administering prescription drug coverage and the structure of the PBM industry. I also discuss empirical evidence that shows that PBMs produce significant benefits to consumers and health plan sponsors by lowering both the prices of prescription drugs to plan participants and the overall cost of prescription drug coverage to the health plan. A. The Role of Pharmacy Benefit Managers PBMs engage in various activities to manage prescription drug benefits for client health plans. First, PBMs assemble networks of retail pharmacies where plan participants can easily fill prescriptions by simply providing a copayment (copay).7 When a consumer presents a prescription to the pharmacist at a retail pharmacy, the pharmacist inquires whether the consumer has prescription drug benefit coverage. If there is coverage, the pharmacies' computer systems ensure that the prescription is filled according to the *5 consumers' specific coverage plan. The consumer pays the retail pharmacy the copayment that is due according to the plan. PBMs negotiate specifics of this plan. More specifically and most importantly, PBMs negotiate the price for prescription drugs at the retail pharmacy. The prescription drugs are then paid for by a combination of consumer payments (copays, deductibles, or co-insurance) and health plan sponsors' payments to the pharmacy.8 By harnessing the buying cloutTHE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4of the many consumers covered by client sponsors' prescription drug plans, the PBMs can negotiate discount prescription drug prices for both health plans and consumers.9 Second, PBMs work with health plan sponsors to create the list of preferred drugs for different medical conditions (the formulary) for which the plan will provide coverage. The health plan offers participants incentives, such as lower copayments, to use the formulary drugs.10 As a result, drugs listed on the formulary face considerable consumer demand, and in turn, produce significant sales for drug manufacturers. Manufacturers negotiate with PBMs to obtain formulary status for their drugs. The primary bargaining tools that manufacturers wield in these negotiations are price discounts and rebates that drug manufacturers pay to PBMs to have their drugs listed on the formulary. Drug manufacturers compete intensively with each other for formulary status, and thus the rebates or discounts can often be substantial.11 The PBMs then use these rebates to lower prices for the formulary drugs. As a result of this negotiation between PBMs and drug manufacturers, both consumers and health plans pay lower prices for prescription drugs.12 Third, many PBMs employ mail-order pharmacies to keep prescription drug costs low. Many prescription drug plans encourage covered consumers to fill prescriptions for ongoing, chronic conditions through mail-order pharmacies. These pharmacies can offer discounts because of the efficiencies they achieve by high-volume dispensing and the dispensing of longer, 90- day prescriptions. In addition, when PBMs own a mail-order pharmacy, they can ensure that customers receive formulary drugs, generic substitutes, or cheaper alternatives when appropriate in order to keep prescription drug prices low. Indeed, empirical research has shown that mail-order pharmacies offer prescription drugs at significantly lower prices than their retail counterparts.13 Fourth, PBMs process and pay prescription drug claims for their health plan sponsor clients. That is, they ensure that when a consumer with prescription drug coverage fills a prescription at a pharmacy, the pharmacy and drug manufacturers receive the correct payments or reimbursements. PBMs can offer significant savings through the economies of scale they achieve in claims processing. As of 2011, the top three PBMs each manage about 20% of the almost four billion prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. every year, requiring large, sophisticated infrastructures.14 *6 Finally, PBMs may perform various other services to efficiently manage the pharmacy benefits of consumers. For example, as pharmacists fill prescriptions, PBMs' computer systems check for drug interactions among a consumer's current prescriptions, determine whether a generic version of a prescribed drug is available, calculate whether enough days have passed before a prescription can be refilled, analyze physician prescribing patterns, and provide treatment information and monitoring of covered individuals with certain chronic diseases.15 B. Structure of the Pharmacy Benefit Management Industry Approximately sixty PBMs operate in the United States today.16 Industry experts estimate that 95% of patients with prescription drug insurance coverage receive their benefits through a PBM.17 This translates into more than 215 million Americans with prescription drug coverage administered by PBMs.18 Although the relative size or market share of PBMs vary according to the specific measure used--i.e. prescriptions per year or individuals covered--the market is generally considered to have at least ten significant competitors.19 The three largest PBMs-- Medco Health Solutions, Express Scripts, and CVS Caremark--account for roughly 20% of the almost four billion prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. every year.20 Express Scripts and Medco have recently merged, increasing market concentration among the largest PBMs. However, several PBMs owned by insurers and retailers, as well as smaller stand-alone PBMs, have become viable competitors to larger PBMs that have traditionally had a stronger market presence.21 Indeed, these smaller PBMs are increasingly winning employer accounts away from Medco, Express Scripts, and CVS Caremark.22 The intense competitionTHE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5in this market has forced PBMs to lower the prices of their services in order to remain competitive, resulting in declining PBM profit margins in recent years.23 *7 C. Benefits of Pharmacy Benefit Management PBMs produce significant benefits for consumers and health plan sponsors by lowering both the price of prescription drugs to plan participants and the overall plan costs of prescription drug coverage. Moreover, PBMs improve health outcomes by making prescription drugs more affordable, thus allowing more Americans to take their medications as prescribed. Consumers with prescription drug coverage administered by PBMs pay significantly lower prices for prescription medication. PBMs negotiate significant rebates from drug manufacturers by offering their drugs exclusive formulary status in exchange for rebates. PBMs also harness the buying clout of their many enrolled consumers to negotiate discounts at retail pharmacies. Consumers benefit from these negotiated rebates and discounts by paying lower prices for prescription drugs. Several studies have measured the rebates PBMs are able to negotiate with drug manufacturers.24 Based on an annual survey of health plans, the average rebate that PBMs negotiated from drug manufacturers in 2012 was $16.70 per prescription for each brand name drug dispensed at a retail pharmacy.25 That is, PBMs were able to negotiate a payment of $16.70 each time a prescription for a brand name drug was dispensed to one of their covered consumers. Similarly, the average rebate that PBMs negotiated for each prescription of a generic drug dispensed at a retail pharmacy was $6.13. Other studies have examined the discounts PBMs negotiate with retail pharmacies.26 A study by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) that explored pharmacy benefits for federal employees found that PBMs were able to negotiate significant discounts on both brand name and generic prescriptions.27 PBMs were able to negotiate prices on brand name drugs that were, on average, 18% less than the prices that non-covered consumers paid for the same drug at the same retail pharmacies.28 Negotiated discounts on generic drugs were even greater; PBMs negotiated prices that were, on average, 47% less than the prices non-covered consumers paid for the same generic drugs at retail pharmacies.29 Most contracts between PBMs and plan sponsors require that PBMs share with the plan sponsor a very large fraction of the discounts they negotiate with manufacturers and pharmacies.30 As a result, the rebates and cost savings negotiated by PBMs have led to significantly lower health plan costs and lower drug prices for consumers.31 The FTC has *8 found that, compared to customers without prescription-drug insurance, customers with PBM-administered prescription drug coverage paid 15% less for brand name drugs that did not have generic alternatives.32 Similarly, customers with PBM-administered drug coverage paid 25% less for brand name drugs that did have generic alternatives.33 The difference in prices was greatest for generic drugs: insured customers paid 50% less for generic drugs than did non-insured customers buying the exact same drugs.34 In addition to lowering the prices that consumers pay for prescription drugs, PBMs have employed several other tools to reduce both prescription drug spending and overall health care spending. Many PBMs have reduced drug spending by increasing the use of generic drugs. Generic drugs are bioequivalent to brand name drugs; they contain the same active ingredients as brand name drugs, and are chemically identical in strength, concentration, dosage form, and route of administration.35 However, generic drugs are substantially less expensive: the average total prices for generic drugs are approximately 25% of the prices of brand name drugs that have no generic alternative.36 By substituting generic drugs for brand name drugs when appropriate, PBMs have lowered prescription drug spending for covered consumers.37 PBMs' use of mail-order pharmacies also significantly reduces prescription drug spending. Mail-order pharmacies produce various cost saving, including the realization of economies of scale by dispensing larger prescription sizes (i.e. 90-day insteadTHE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6of 30-day), dispensing more formulary drugs that produce manufacturer rebates, and increasing substitutions from brand name to generic drugs.38 These cost savings have translated into significant savings for consumers. The average price that consumers and health plans paid for brand name generic drugs dispensed from mail-order pharmacies was 27% less than the price that consumers without prescription drug coverage paid at retail pharmacies for the exact same drugs.39 For generic drugs, mail- order pharmacies dispensed drugs that cost 53% less than what consumers without prescription drug coverage paid at retail pharmacies.40 PBMs also reduce prescription drug spending with various other cost-saving approaches. Some PBMs employ therapeutic interchange programs to substitute *9 clinically appropriate and less costly drugs with physician approval.41 Others use a prior authorization process that requires the PBM to approve the dispensing of certain drugs before the health plan sponsor will pay for it.42 Similarly, step therapy plans require patients to try less expensive drugs before the plan sponsor will pay for more expensive drugs.43 Most PBMs employ various other utilization controls, such as limits on frequent refills, to control costs.44 PBMs' cost-cutting tools produce significant savings for consumers. Estimates of the magnitude of PBMs' cost-savings range from 30%45 to 35%46 of total prescription drug spending. More affordable prescription drugs may mean that more Americans will be able to afford to take their medication as prescribed. Higher priced prescription drugs result in more people skipping doses or not filling prescriptions at all.47 Thus, by saving consumers money, PBMs are also improving health outcomes and, in many cases, they may be saving lives. II. REGULATION OF PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS Despite the substantial cost savings outlined in the previous section, PBMs also face substantial criticism. In this section, I discuss the specific arguments that critics make in their demands for more regulation of the PBM industry and the evidence showing that more regulation is unnecessary. I also briefly describe the history of federal and state regulatory efforts toward the PBM industry. A. The Need for Regulation Critics of the PBM industry argue that the PBM business model creates fundamental conflicts of interest. They argue that these conflicts of interest arise as a result of the incentives created both by PBMs' contracts with drug manufacturers and retail pharmacies and by PBMs' ownership of mail-order pharmacies. As a result, critics argue that more regulation of the PBM industry is needed to protect the interests of consumers and plan sponsors. Critics allege that the rebates drug manufacturers pay to PBMs to have their drugs listed on the formulary create incentives for PBMs to heavily favor certain drugs over others.48 This could be detrimental to consumers and plan sponsors if the favored drugs *10 either cost more or provide inferior therapeutic benefits as compared with other alternatives. Similarly, critics claim that PBMs' confidential contracts with retail pharmacies create potential conflicts of interest. For example, they argue that PBMs can unfairly increase the spread--the difference between the prices plan sponsors pay for a drug and the amount the PBM reimburses the retail pharmacy-- to increase PBM profits.49 This could harm pharmacies, plan sponsors, and consumers by generating overpayments from plans and reduced payments to retail pharmacies. However, the largest controversy involves PBMs' ownership of mail-order pharmacies. Critics assert that by both administering the pharmacy benefits for plan sponsors and dispensing drugs via their mail-order pharmacy, PBMs have the opportunity to create various \"self-dealing\" arrangements to increase their profits.50 For example, PBMs could encourage plans to adopt certain payment structures that steer consumers to purchasing more drugs from the PBM-owned mail-order pharmacy.51 InTHE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7addition, critics allege that PBMs can persuade their mail-order pharmacies to dispense more brand name drugs or expensive drugs that yield higher rebates from drug manufacturers.52 Finally, PBM opponents allege that PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies increase their profits by repackaging drugs and selling them at a higher price.53 All of these practices could be harmful if PBMs' increased profits came at the expense of consumers. In response to these allegations, several government entities--The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the General Accounting Office (GAO), and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)--have analyzed the PBM industry to determine whether any of these alleged conflicts of interest produce undesirable consequences for consumers and plan sponsors.54 The studies all conclude that PBMs benefit consumers and health plan sponsors by significantly reducing the prices that consumers pay for prescription drugs.55 In response to the specific allegations by critics, both the FTC and GAO found that PBMs pass on a significant portion of the payments they receive from drug manufacturers.56 In fact, the GAO concluded that PBMs' sharing of manufacturer payments reduce total annual drug spending by as much as 9%.57 Similarly, the GAO *11 found that PBMs achieved significant discounts for drugs purchased at retail pharmacies; customers with PBM-administered drug coverage paid 18% to 47% less than non-covered consumers paid for the same drug at the same retail pharmacies.58 In regards to the allegations concerning PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies, the FTC found no evidence of self-dealing arrangements. It found that PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies generally are no less likely to substitute generic drugs for brand name drugs than are either retail pharmacies or mail-order pharmacies not owned by PBMs.59 Similarly, it concluded that there is no evidence that PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies substitute more expensive drugs for therapeutically similar cheaper drugs.60 Finally, the FTC found that PBMs rarely dispense repackaged drugs through their owned mail-order pharmacies, and, as a result, the financial impact of repackaging is negligible.61 Both GAO and FTC found that as a result of PBMs' cost- saving practices, the prices that consumers paid for prescription drugs dispensed from PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies are significantly less than the prices of drugs dispensed from retail pharmacies.62 B. History of Regulatory Efforts Despite the lack of evidence, suspicion of PBMs has led both state and federal governments to pursue various frameworks for regulating the PBM industry.63 In general, the federal government's efforts to regulate the PBM industry have been much less expansive than the states' efforts.64 The FTC, the federal agency tasked with promoting consumer protection and eliminating anti-competitive business practices, has focused its oversight of PBMs on pursuing antitrust issues related to the PBM industry.65 Beyond that, many FTC officials believe it is unnecessary to regulate the PBM industry and are openly opposed to such regulation.66 The Department of Labor, the government agency that regulates employee benefit plans, has not sought to regulate the PBM industry.67 Indeed, some regulatory scholars believe it would be impossible for preexisting regulatory agencies to effectively monitor the nuanced commercial interactions that allow PBMs to lower healthcare costs;68 they fear that misguided administrative actions by regulators that do not fully understand the complexity of the PBM industry and business model could have a negative impact on the integrity of the healthcare system.69 Some advocate for the creation of an entirely new federal regulatory *12 agency devoted to monitoring the PBM industry.70 However, the creation of such an agency is unlikely given government concerns that the costs of bureaucratic red tape would negate the savings that the PBM industry presently provides to consumers.71 The federal government's reluctance to regulate PBMs has encouraged the critics of PBMs to turn to the states for PBM regulation.72 Over the past decade, nearly every state has considered legislation to regulate PBMs, and seventeen states have enacted some regulation.73 The states have chosen different aspects of PBMS to regulate, including information disclosureTHE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8licensing, investigations, duties to clients, and rebate sharing.74 The diversity of regulatory structures enacted in different states has caused redundant, complex litigation.75 Still, there are two common themes that unify PBM regulation across most states.76 First, almost all states require PBMs to register with their state's insurance commissioner.77 Second, states generally require PBMs to submit annual audits.78 Beyond these common themes, states' regulatory frameworks contain numerous idiosyncratic features distinguishing them from other states.79 III. REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS Despite the assorted regulatory environments that PBMs face in different states, all states that have elected to regulate PBMs have done so through their Insurance Commission. However, in 2011, Mississippi became the first and only state to shift regulatory authority over PBMs from the Insurance Commission to the Board of Pharmacy.80 Legislatures in Oregon, Hawaii, and Oklahoma are also considering proposals to allow the state Boards of Pharmacy to regulate PBMs. In the last legislative session, Washington, New Hampshire, Alabama, and Louisiana considered similar proposals.81 In this section, I discuss existing and proposed regulatory schemes that grant Boards of Pharmacy regulatory authority over PBMs. Then I present an economic analysis of these approaches and explain why granting regulatory authority to a market adversary threatens competition in the prescription drug market. As a result of these approaches, *13 both consumers and health plan sponsors will pay more for prescription drugs and prescription drug coverage. A. Regulation by the Board of Pharmacy Prior to 2011, all states placed regulatory authority over PBMs with a neutral insurance commission.82 The state insurance commissioners are either political appointees or elected officials that have nothing to gain or lose from regulatory decisions that affect PBMs.83 Several states, however, have recently taken steps to shift regulatory control of PBMs away from insurance commissioners and to the state Boards of Pharmacy.84 Unlike the neutral insurance commissions, the Boards of Pharmacy are composed of pharmacists that are the direct market adversaries of PBMs.85 1. Mississippi On April 26, 2011, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour signed Senate Bill 2445 amending the Mississippi Pharmacy Practice Act.86 This law shifted regulatory authority over PBMs from the Mississippi Insurance Commissioner to the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy. Under the new amendments, PBMs need to clear several regulatory hurdles to legally operate in Mississippi. The law requires PBMs to obtain a license from the Board of Pharmacy,87 and to submit annual balance sheets and income statements to the Board of Pharmacy.88 Although these requirements do not differ substantially from what was required of PBMs prior to enactment of the new amendments,89 the critical difference is that PBMs must turn over the necessary information to the Board of Pharmacy instead of a neutral insurance commission. Of greater concern is that the new amendments to the Mississippi Pharmacy Practice Act allow the Board to conduct financial examinations of PBMs' businesses,90 and require PBMs to share potentially sensitive business information with the Board.91 Although the Act specifies that PBMs will not be required to disclose proprietary information, it provides no guidance on what is considered proprietary. Thus, the scope of protection for sensitive financial information is unclear. Moreover, the Board of Pharmacy is permitted to share the business information it *14 obtains from PBMs with any health plan sponsor, pharmacist, or pharmacy.92 As I explain in the next section, allowing the Board to share sensitive business information with pharmacies, the market adversaries of PBMs, threatensTHE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9to undercut competition in the PBM industry and increase the cost of both prescription drugs and prescription drug coverage. These amendments to the Mississippi Pharmacy Practice Act include a sunset provision repealing these regulatory changes on July 1, 2013.93 2. Proposals in Other States Legislation currently under consideration in Oregon, Hawaii, and Oklahoma would alter regulatory structures for monitoring PBMs by shifting power to the States' Boards of Pharmacy. In the last legislative session, Washington, New Hampshire, Alabama, and Louisiana also considered similar proposals.94 The regulatory provisions in the proposed legislation are similar to those enacted in Mississippi. On January 14, 2013, the Oregon Representative Committee on Health Care introduced House Bill 2123, which would require the Oregon Board of Pharmacy to regulate PBMs.95 The proposed legislation would require PBMs conducting business in Oregon to obtain a license from the Oregon Board of Pharmacy.96 It would alter PBMs' pricing schemes by requiring PBMs \"to permit covered individuals to fill mail-order prescriptions at a retail community pharmacy [sic] in the same manner and at similar price that individuals fill orders at mail-order pharmacies.\"97 Thus, this provision would eliminate the market advantage that PBMs' mail-order pharmacies currently have over retail pharmacies. On January 17, 2013, both Oklahoma and Hawaii introduced legislation altering the states' regulation of PBMs.98 Hawaii's legislation grants the Board of Pharmacy relatively open-ended regulatory authority over PBMs by allowing the Board \"to adopt rules ... to regulate all pharmacy benefit management companies.\"99 In addition to requiring PBMs to \"obtain a license from the State Board of Pharmacy,\"100 Oklahoma's legislation specifically grants the Board the ability to demand proprietary business information from PBMs. It would allow the Board to demand disclosures from PBMs and, as necessary, \"subpoena witnesses and information.\"101 It would also require PBMs to disclose sensitive financial information including \"the difference in the amount paid to providers for prescription services rendered to covered individuals and the amount billed by the pharmacy benefits manager to the covered entity or plan sponsor to pay for prescription services rendered to covered individuals.\"102 In *15 other words, Oklahoma's legislation explicitly allows the Board of Pharmacy to demand confidential information about the business practices of PBMs. B. Economic Analysis of Regulation by a Market Adversary The amended Mississippi Pharmacy Practice Act creates an inherent conflict of interest by giving pharmacists regulatory control over their natural competitors in the marketplace. The power to regulate a market adversary gives pharmacists unprecedented power and will undercut competition in the prescription drug market. Moreover, this regulatory scheme will increase the prices of prescription drugs for both consumers and health plan sponsors. Pharmacists and PBMs are market adversaries in two different areas of the prescription drug market. First, pharmacists and PBMs negotiate prices that plan sponsors will pay for prescription drugs at retail pharmacies; the lower the price that PBMs can negotiate, the lower the profits for pharmacies. Second, retail pharmacies directly compete with PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies for prescription drug sales; the more prescription drugs sold by mail-order pharmacies, the fewer drugs sold by retail pharmacies. Because PBMs are the direct market adversaries of pharmacies in several segments of the prescription drug market, pharmacists have the incentive to take actions that benefit themselves at the expense of PBMs. Reductions of PBMs' profits generally lead to more profits for pharmacists. By granting the pharmacist-controlled Mississippi Board of Pharmacy regulatory authority overTHE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10PBMs, the amended Act grants pharmacists the power to act on these incentives. That is, under the amended Act, the Board has both the incentive and the authority to exercise its regulatory power in ways that weaken PBMs' competitive positions, and in turn, benefit pharmacies. Indeed, because PBMs' mail-order pharmacies are direct competitors to retail pharmacies, Mississippi's PBM regulatory framework is similar to allowing a board composed of taxi drivers to regulate a market competitor, private town car companies. Imagine the consequences if the taxi board had the authority to set rules governing the town car business model or demand confidential business information from town car companies. The taxi board would have both the incentive and the ability to take regulatory measures that competitively disadvantaged town car companies while benefitting taxi drivers. The incentives facing the pharmacist-controlled Board of Pharmacy are no different than the incentives facing a taxi board. There are numerous ways that the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy can exploit this regulatory power to establish rules and practices that give pharmacists a competitive advantage at the expense of the PBM industry. The Board of Pharmacy could establish various rules or practices that improve pharmacists' bargaining position as they negotiate with PBMs for retail prescription drug prices. Similarly, the Board could establish rules that restrict cost-saving practices that attract consumers to mail-order pharmacies and away from retail pharmacies. In the next sections, I discuss two concrete examples that demonstrate how the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy has already established rules and practices that competitively disadvantage PBMs while benefiting pharmacists: requiring *16 PBMs to turn over sensitive financial information and imposing a fiduciary duty on PBMs. Unfortunately, the Board's recently adopted regulations not only reduce the profitability of PBMs, they also hurt consumers and sponsors. Future Board practices will have the same impact.103 PBMs' business strategies that reduce profits for pharmacies-- negotiating price discounts at retail pharmacies and implementing cost-saving practices at mail-order pharmacies that attract customers away from retail pharmacies--also lower the prices that consumers and health plans pay for prescription drugs. Thus, by restricting these business strategies in an effort to improve pharmacists' profits, the Board would increase the prices that health plan sponsors and consumers pay for prescription drugs. In a letter addressing the likely consequences of allowing the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy to regulate PBMs, the Federal Trade Commission opined on the wisdom of allowing boards to regulate market adversaries: Although we offer no specific recommendations on the ideal structure for regulating PBMs, it is our understanding that no other state has placed PBMs under the regulatory control of its pharmacy board. Because pharmacists and PBMs have a competitive, and at times, adversarial relationship, we are concerned that giving the pharmacy board regulatory power over PBMs may create tensions and conflicts of interest for the pharmacy board.104 Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission has opposed regulatory boards composed of market participants in other industries. In the Matter of North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners,105 the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners \"determined on its own that teeth whitening was a practice that could be performed only under the supervision of a dentist and used the imprimatur of state authority to drive lower-priced non-dentists from the relevant market.\"106 The board consisted of six licensed dentists, one licensed dental hygienist, and one consumer member.107 In their analysis of the regulatory framework of the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners, the FTC stated that when a state regulatory body is controlled by participants in the very industry it purports to regulate, \"common sense and economic theory ... dictate the conclusion that Board actions in this area could be self interested.\"108 The FTC questioned the board's ability to regulate the North Carolina dental industry in an unbiased fashion given the economic and political pressures influencing the members of the board.109 The FTC also noted the lack of supervision of the board's decision making by impartial state actors.THE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11*17 The United States Supreme Court has also recognized the danger of regulatory boards composed of market participants pursuing their own interests rather than the interests of the state.110 In Patrick v. Burget ,111 a surgeon in Oregon declined an invitation to join a local medical clinic and instead began an independent practice in competition with the clinic.112 Subsequently, the surgeon experienced difficulties \"in his professional dealings with clinic physicians.\"113 These difficulties ultimately culminated in the local hospital's peer-review board terminating the surgeon's privileges to use the hospital on the ground that petitioner's care of his patients was below the standard of the hospital.114 The peer-review board consisted of members of the local medical clinic that the surgeon had declined to join.115 The surgeon filed suit alleging that the peer- review board violated the Sherman Act by initiating proceedings in order to reduce competition rather than to improve patient care. The Court ruled in favor of the surgeon and noted that a member of a private regulatory body \"may be presumed to be acting primarily on his or her own behalf.\"116 The Court added that state supervision is necessary to ensure regulatory bodies actually further state regulatory policies.117 The design of Mississippi's PBM regulatory framework is as troubling as the regulatory frameworks discussed in Patrick and North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners , and could raise antitrust issues similar to those in Patrick .118 Mississippi's Board of Pharmacy is controlled by pharmacists that oppose the PBM industry. As was suggested by the FTC and Supreme Court, it is safe to assume that the members of a professional board that are market adversaries to the groups they are charged with regulating will act in their own self-interest. Moreover, there are no statutory safeguards to protect the PBM industry when members of the Board of Pharmacy pursue policies benefitting pharmacists at the expense of the PBMs. Mississippi has no program to actively supervise the Board of Pharmacy's decisions; there is no Mississippi statute that *18 provides for direct judicial review of the Board of Pharmacy's actions.119 Although the PBM industry can challenge decisions by the Board of Pharmacy in court, until a court rules, PBMs will suffer substantial financial losses and consumers and health plan sponsors will pay more for prescription drugs. Thus, under the amended Mississippi Pharmacy Practice Act, the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy has both the incentive and the opportunity to exert its regulatory authority in ways that benefit pharmacies at the expense of PBMs. Even though the Board has only had regulatory authority over PBMs for a little over a year, two examples of regulations that harm PBMs have already emerged. 1. Disclosure of Sensitive Business Information The first example of a regulation by the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy that competitively disadvantages PBMs while benefitting pharmacies is the Board's ability to demand sensitive business information from PBMs. This business information includes not only standard financial statements such as balance sheets and income statements, but also \"any other information relating to the operations of the pharmacy benefit manager required by the board.\"120 Although the Act specifies that PBMs will not be required to disclose proprietary information, it provides no guidance on what is considered proprietary. Thus, the scope of protection for sensitive financial information is unclear. Moreover, the amended Act gives the Board the power to share PBMs' financial information with pharmacists, the direct market rivals of PBMs: \"The board may provide a copy of the financial examination to the person or entity who provides or operates the health insurance plan or to a pharmacist or pharmacy.\"121 Thus, the amended Act grants the Board of Pharmacy the power to require PBMs to turn over sensitive financial information, and then allows the Board to share that information with pharmacies. This practice will benefit pharmacies by giving them business information about their market adversaries while weakening the PBM industry and producing significant harms for consumers and health plan sponsors.THE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12As an initial matter, if the Board requires PBMs to turn over additional financial information than was previously required, the collection, preparation, and presentation of the additional information will increase costs for the PBMs.122 These costs will likely be passed on to health plans and consumers. More importantly, if the Board forces PBMs to turn over sensitive financial information, it will reduce PBMs' bargaining power to negotiate discounts with pharmacies and rebates with drug manufacturers, thus increasing drug prices for consumers. Both pharmacies and drug manufacturers are less likely to offer the same price terms to PBMs when they know their rival pharmacies or manufacturers can learn *19 the specifics of the arrangement. When rivals can see the arrangement and offer the same or better terms, it blunts the incentive to offer PBMs favorable terms in the first place.123 Moreover, pharmacies and manufacturers will be less likely to offer \"deals\" when they know that everyone they do business with can see the terms of the deal and will likely demand the same terms.124 Finally, uncertainty about rivals' offerings induces pharmacies to offer greater discounts and manufacturers to offer greater rebates to try to outdo the \"unknown\" deals.125 But when the arrangements are no longer unknown, this incentive to outdo unknown price terms disappears. Hence, disclosure of sensitive financial information will reduce the discounts and rebates that PBMs can pass on to consumers and health plan sponsors. As a result, prescription drug spending will increase. Indeed, federal antitrust agencies have explained how sharing information among competitors can harm consumers; it \"can blunt a firm's incentive to offer customers better deals by undercutting the extent to which such a move would win business away from rivals\" and \"also can enhance a firm's incentive to raise prices by assuaging the fear that such a move would lose customers to rivals.\"126 Thus, granting the Board the power both to require PBMs to disclose sensitive business information and to share that information with pharmacies will reduce competition in the market for prescription drugs. Pharmacies and manufacturers will no longer compete as effectively for PBMs' business when business arrangements are no longer private. Moreover, PBMs will no longer be able to intensely compete for contracts with health plan sponsors by offering exclusive prices that they were able to negotiate with pharmacies and drug manufacturers. Finally, the increase in drug prices and reductions in competition could spill over to states beyond Mississippi. PBMs' business practices are likely similar across states so that disclosing information about PBMs' practices in Mississippi will inform pharmacies and manufacturers about PBMs' practices in other states. They can use the information from Mississippi for their benefit in other states. For example, pharmacies and drug manufacturers in Alabama may demand the same pricing arrangements as PBMs negotiated in Mississippi. Thus, disclosure of sensitive financial information in Mississippi could reduce competition across the industry and cause prescription drug prices to increase nationwide. 2. Imposing a Fiduciary Duty on Pharmacy Benefit Managers The most recent example of the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy exploiting its regulatory authority to disadvantage PBMs is the imposition of a fiduciary duty on PBMs. Adopted by the Board of Pharmacy on January 23, 2013, the new amendment to the Mississippi Pharmacy Practice Regulations states that PBMs \"shall operate to the best interest of the patient or citizen of Mississippi, including costs related to the patient or *20 citizen.\"127 A duty to act in the \"best interest\" has been interpreted by courts to be a fiduciary duty;128 thus, this new regulation gives PBMs a fiduciary duty to covered consumers. As a fiduciary, a PBM would owe consumers a duty of loyalty by acting \"on behalf of the principal and only for his benefit.\"129 This fiduciary duty includes a \"duty to give information\" that is independent of any disclosure requirements contained in the statute or private contracts and a \"duty to account for profits\" that may require PBMs to share more of their profits with health plan clients.130THE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13Fiduciary duties generally exist in situations where contracts cannot easily solve potential conflicts of interest. In these situations, the threat of litigation that accompanies a fiduciary duty can deter opportunistic behavior.131 However, the PBM marketplace is not one in which contracts generally fail to protect against opportunistic behavior. Health plan sponsors can enter into any contract they choose, and because of the intense competition among PBMs for contracts with health plan sponsors, the sponsors have considerable leverage to obtain desired contract terms.132 As a result, the sponsors can require a limited fiduciary duty for PBMs or the disclosure of sensitive business information in the contract. Even though health plan sponsors could contract for a fiduciary duty for PBM partners, many would choose not to because of the established consequences of this heightened legal duty. A fiduciary duty entails a broader set of legal obligations than those typically specified in PBM contracts. With the new legal obligations come new litigation risks; PBMs could be liable in tort actions in addition to being subject to liability claims for breach of contract.133 These new litigation risks will increase certain legal, administrative, and operating costs for PBMs. PBMs, in turn, will pass on these additional costs to health plan sponsors and consumers, increasing the cost of prescription drug coverage. First, the increase in the risk of litigation for fiduciaries will increase certain legal and administrative costs for PBMs. The legal obligations accompanying a fiduciary duty present new uncertainties and complexities. PBMs will either expand the efforts of their existing litigation departments or consult with outside counsel to help them understand *21 their new status and advise them on certain defensive business practices to adopt in order to avoid litigation.134 Second, liability concerns may deter PBMs from engaging in certain cost-reducing practices. For example, because fiduciaries cannot profit at the expense of their clients, PBMs may be concerned that owning a mail-order pharmacy and employing incentives to direct covered consumers to that pharmacy will be interpreted as profiting at the expense of their clients.135 Because mail-order pharmacies are able to offer lower priced prescription drugs,136 deterring PBMs from utilizing mail-order pharmacies will increase the prices that consumers and health plan sponsors pay for prescription drugs. PBMs may be hesitant to contract at all with certain health plan sponsors because of the increased litigation risk that accompanies their fiduciary duty in these relationships. For example, sponsors that wish to provide only a limited network of retail pharmacies or place fewer preferred drugs on their formularies may expose PBMs to claims for breach of duties of care and skill if these arrangements appear to depart from best industry practices.137 Similarly, health plan sponsors may allege a breach of fiduciary duty if PBMs negotiate rebates from manufacturers or discounts from retail pharmacies that are less favorable relative to the terms negotiated by other PBMs or by the same PBMs in contracts with other health plan sponsors.138 If PBMs agree to contract with health plan sponsors despite the fiduciary duty, they will only be willing to incur the increased litigation risk if they receive higher fees from health plan sponsors. These fees will increase the cost of prescription drug coverage for consumers. Moreover, fiduciary status will impose additional reporting requirements on PBMs that would likely lead to the disclosure of sensitive business information.139 As previously discussed, such disclosure will undermine competition in the PBM industry and increase prescription drug prices for consumers and health plan sponsors. It will also competitively disadvantage PBMs while benefitting pharmacies. Thus, imposing a fiduciary duty on PBMs will compel these companies to adopt certain defensive measures, curb various cost- saving practices, incur additional legal and administrative costs, and increase the reporting of sensitive business information. As a result of these changes, the cost of prescription drug coverage administered by PBMs will increase. Moreover, many of the possible consequences of a fiduciary duty, such as a reduction in the utilization of mail-order pharmacies or increased reporting of sensitive business information, will undermine PBMs' competitive positions in the prescription drug market relative to retail pharmacies that do not have fiduciary status. That the Board of Pharmacy would impose a fiduciary duty on PBMs when a heightened legal duty is unnecessary--health plan sponsors' contracts can already safeguard against opportunistic behaviorTHE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE: THE..., 9 NW J. L. & Soc. Pol'y 1 \u00a9 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14and even contractually impose a fiduciary duty on PBMs--demonstrates that the Board is exploiting its regulatory authority to disadvantage PBMs while benefitting pharmacies. *22 Indeed, no state regulatory agency has ever independently enacted a rule imposing a fiduciary duty on PBMs. Over the past decade, there have been bills introduced in over thirty states that sought to impose a fiduciary standard on PBMs.140 However, legislatures in twenty nine of these states decided against imposing a fiduciary duty after considering the likely consequences. Maine, in 2003, is the only state that enacted such a law, but that law was subsequently repealed by the Maine legislature in 2011.141 The District of Columbia also enacted a fiduciary provision in a 2004 law. That law, after years of litigation, was unanimously overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2010.142 CONCLUSION PBMs save Americans billions of dollars each year by lowering both the prices that consumers pay for prescription drugs and the prices that health plans pay for drug coverage. However, new regulatory developments in some states threaten to undercut competition in the PBM industry and disrupt the cost savings PBMs currently generate. The regulatory scheme that was adopted by Mississippi in 2011 and is currently under legislative consideration in three other states-- Oregon, Oklahoma, and Hawaii--shifts regulatory control of PBMs from the neutral Insurance Commissions to the states' Boards of Pharmacy. The fundamental problem with this structure is that the Boards of Pharmacy are made up of pharmacists, the direct market adversaries of PBMs. In several different areas of the prescription drug market, PBMs and pharmacists are in direct competition over profits. Thus, granting Boards of Pharmacy regulatory control over PBMs creates an inherent conflict of interest by giving pharmacists regulatory control over their natural competitors in the marketplace. Under this new regulatory scheme, the Board has both the incentive and the power to exercise its regulatory power in ways that weaken PBMs' competitive positions and, in turn, benefit pharmacies. The power to regulate a market adversary gives pharmacists unprecedented power and will severely undercut competition in the prescription drug market. Unfortunately, this new regulatory scheme does more than just undermine competition in the PBM industry, it will also increase the prices that consumers and third parties must pay for prescription drugs. Total annual prescription drug spending in the U.S. is currently around $263 billion, but industry estimates suggest that this number would be at least $100 billion more if it were not for PBMs' cost-saving practices.143 It would be reckless for states to enact or maintain regulatory schemes that threaten to undo *23 these cost savings and increase prescription drug prices in our current state of ever-increasing healthcare costs.

A decade-old study by the FTC reported that even when there was less competition in the PBM industry, PBMs passed on over 50% of the cost savings to health plan sponsors. FED. TRADE COMM'N , supra note 4, at 57-60. However, as competition for sponsor contracts has intensified, evidence suggests that PBMs have agreed to share more of the cost savings to remain competitive.

Patrick v. Burget, 486 U.S. 94, 100 (1988) . It can be difficult to assess whether a regulatory board is acting in the interest of the state and should be immune from Sherman Act liability. The Court uses a two pronged test to evaluate whether the actions of a board should be deemed state action and thus shielded from the antitrust laws: first, the Court considers whether the challenged activity is \"clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy;\" second, the court considers whether the anticompetitive conduct is \"actively supervised by U.S. . 116Patrick 118The Supreme Court \"established a rigorous two-pronged test to determine whether anticompetitive conduct engaged in by private parties should be deemed state action and thus shielded from the antitrust laws.

Box 1018 Jackson, MS 39215-1018 Dear Representative Formby: The staffs of the Federal Trade Commission =s Office of Policy Planning, Bureau of Competition, and Bureau of Economics 1 are pleased to respond to your request for comments on the likely competitive effects of the pharmacy benefit manager (\"PBM\") related provisions of Mississi ppi Senate Bill 2445 (\"SB-2445\" or \"the Bill\"). The Bill, among other things, would \"shift regulatory authority over PBMs from the Insurance Commissioner to the Board of Pharmacy.\" You asked the FTC to examine the Bill to determine \"whether the proposed legislation is anti-competitive and will likely result in the increased cost of pharmaceutical care for consumers.\"2 We are concerned that SB-2445, if enacted as passed by th e Mississippi State Senate, may increase pharmaceutical prices and reduce competition. First, allowing the Pharmacy Board to regulate PBMs will likely undermine the PBM's ability to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, which in tu rn, will raise those prices for both insurers and consumers covered by insurance. Sec ond, the Bill appears to allow the Pharmacy Board to obtain from PBMs financial and any ot her business information it desires and to provide that informa tion to third parties. 3 If pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacists, and pharmacies gain access to whatever in formation the Pharmacy Board requires the 1 This letter expresses the views of the Federal Trad e Commission's Office of Policy Planning, Bureau of Competition, and Bureau of Economics.

The Commission has, however, voted to authorize us to submit these comments. 2 Letter from Hon. Mark Formby to Jon Leibowitz, Chairman, Federal Trade Commission (March 1, 2011). This comment addresses SB-2445, as requested, but staff notes that similar legislation was passed by the Mississippi House of Representatives on March 3, 2011. It is our understanding that the two bills will be considered and reconciled by a conference committee an d that these comments are being requested for the purpose of informing those discussions. 3 SB-2445, Section 73-21-157 (2)(a-b). PBMs to produce, they could have acce ss to competitively sensitive information, potentially facilitate collusion, and increas e prescription drug pr ices. Third, SB-2445 would change current law to require nonres ident pharmacies that deliver prescription drugs to Mississippi residents to have a Mississippi-licensed pharmacist-in-charge.4 This requirement would add to out-of-state pharm acies' expenses the fees and other costs associated with licensure, continuing edu cation, and registration of a pharmacist in Mississippi, in addition to the costs imposed by requirements for pharmacists in the state in which the nonresident pharmacies operate.5 These additional costs would likely be passed on to Mississippi cons umers and health plans. Interest and Experience of the Federal Trade Commission Congress has charged the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\" or \"Commission\") with preventing unfair methods of competition an d unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.6 Pursuant to its st atutory mandate, the FTC seeks to identify business practices and regulations that impede competition without offering countervailing benefits to consumers. For several decades, the FTC and its staff have investigated the competitive e ffects of restrictions on the bus iness practices of health care providers,7 issued reports and studies regardi ng various aspects of the pharmaceutical industry,8 and brought numerous enforcement actions in the pharmaceutical industry.9 The Commission has significant expertis e in the competitive issues surrounding PBMs. Of particular relevance to SB-2445 is the Commission's \"C onflict of Interest Study\" regarding PBM practices. In respons e to a Congressional directive in 2003, the FTC analyzed data on PBM pricing, generic substitution, therapeutic interchange, and repackaging practices. The study examined whether PBM ownership of mail-order pharmacies served to maximize competition a nd lower prescription drug prices for plan sponsors. In its 2005 report based on the study (\"PBM Study\"), the FTC found, among other things, that the prices for a common basket of prescription drugs dispensed by PBM-owned mail order pharmacies were typically lower than th e prices charged by retail pharmacies. 10 The study also found competition affo rds health plans substantial tools with which to safeguard their interest s. Consumers benefit as a result. 4 SB-2445, Section 73-21-106. 5 The current law requires, among other things, registration of the non-resident pharmacy, which is generally a less-restrictive alternative to duplicative professional licensure. 6 Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.

They act as clearinghouses for hea lth plans, covered individuals, and retail pharmacies, and may provide a variety of relate d services. These include: 1) developing networks of local pharmacies; 2) provid ing access to mail order pharmacies; 3) developing drug formularies and negotiating discounts and rebates from drug companies in exchange for preferential placement in the formulary;14 4) providing analysis of physician prescribing patterns; and 5) providi ng treatment information and monitoring of covered individuals with cer tain chronic diseases. Of particular relevance to SB-2445, PBMs negotiate drug prices with pharmacies participating in the PBMs' networks and pa yments for prescription drugs and services with health plan sponsors. In addition, contracts with health plan sponsors specify how the plan will share in any rebates or discounts the PBM obtains from pharmaceutical manufacturers.15 PHARMACIES , 23 (Aug. 2005) STUDY \"), available at http://www ftc.gov/reports/pharmben e fit05/050906pharmbenefitrpt.pdf . 11 See Hearings on Health Care and Competition Law and Policy, June 26, 2003, available at http://www ftc.gov/ogc/healthcareh earing s/030626ftctrans.pdf .

Kilgore (Oct. 2, 2006), available at http://www ftc.gov/b e/ V060018.pdf . 14 A formulary is a list of approved or preferred drugs for the plan. 15 These payments are paid to the plan sponsor, retained by the PBM, or shared between them depending on the specifics of the contract between these parties. See PBM STUDY , supra note 10, at 59-60; John Richardson, Health Strategies Cons ultancy, Health Care Hearings, supra note 11, at 23-24 (PBMs \"can be paid through administrative fees, share of rebates, or some combination.\"); Thomas M. Boudreau, Express Scripts, Health Care Hearings, supra note 11, at 124. Typically, contracts also specify a plan's audit rights with respect to formular y and payment sharing. See PBM STUDY , supra note 10, at 58. 3 PBMs negotiate lower p harmacy costs by forming a preferred or exclusive network of retail pharmacies.16 Retail pharmacies offer discounts to PBMs depending on the type and number of hea lth plans covered by the PBM and the exclusivity of the network \u2014 the more exclusive the network, th e higher the discount. This mechanism can make customer volume respond very strongly to prices, creating an incentive for pharmacies to bid aggressively on prescripti on drug prices and poten tially reducing the prices that public and private health plans and consumers pay for pharmaceuticals.17 PBMs also use mail-order pharmacies to manage prescription drug costs. Many PBMs own mail-order pharmacies. Plan s ponsors sometimes encourage patients with chronic conditions who require repeated re fills to seek the discounts that 90-day prescriptions and high-volume mail-order pharm acies can offer. Mail-order pharmacies, including those owned by PBMs, compete directly with retail pharmacies. 18 PBMs also establish relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, who compete to have their drugs placed on a PBM's formulary by offering discounts or rebates. Likely Effects of SB-2445 Several provisions of the Bill could harm competition and consumers. First, the bill empowers the Pharmacy Board to regulate PBMs and may impede PBMs' ability to negotiate effectively contracts with pharmaci es that save money for Mississippi health plans and consumers. Second, the Pharmacy Board would have vague and potentially unlimited authority to demand disclosures of sensitive PBM business information, without any confidentiality pr otections, which could restrict PBMs' ability to negotiate contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturer s and pharmacies to provide the best prescription drug programs and prices for Mi ssissippi consumers. Third, changing the law to require an out-of-state pharmacy to have a Mississippi li censed pharmacist-in- charge if it wants to sell pres cription drugs to Mississippi consumers could raise the costs of doing business without any countervailing benefits. Collectively, these requirements may increase the prices that both public and private health plans, and ultimately Mississippi consumers, pay for prescription drugs. (a) Shifting Regulatory Authority of PBMs from the Insurance Commissioner to the Pharmacy Board 16 A PBM may have several networks that differ in degree or scope of exclusivity. 17 See PBM STUDY , supra note 10, at 3; General Accounting Office, Effects of Using Pharmacy Benefit Managers on Health Plans, Enrollees, and Pharmacies at 11 (Jan. 2003) (\"GAO Report\"), available at http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-03-196 (noting when Blue Cross Blue Shield introduced a plan with a smaller network of retail pharmacies, it included deeper discounts in its retail pharmacy payments); Letter from FTC staff to Patrick C. Lynch, Rhode Island Attorney General and Juan M. Pichardo, Rhode Island Deputy Senate Majority Leader, State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (Apr. 8, 2004), available at http://www ftc.gov/os/2004/04/ribills.pdf (discussing these issues more extensively). 18 See PBM STUDY , supra note 10, at i, 18-19. 4The current law places regulatory aut hority over PBMs with the Insurance Commissioner, who has discre tion over what information PBMs must provide on their annual financial statements and reports. The Pharmacy Board currently receives copies of those annual reports. SB-2445 would shif t the regulatory author ity and power to the Pharmacy Board, which consists of seven members, all of whom must be pharmacists. Thus, pharmacists, who negotiate retail pres cription drug prices with PBMs and compete against PBM-owned mail-order pharmaci es, would now be regulating PBMs. Although we offer no specific recomme ndations on the ideal structure for regulating PBMs, 19 it is our understanding that no other state has placed PBMs under the regulatory control of its pharmacy board.20 Because pharmacists and PBMs have a competitive, and at times, adversarial rela tionship, we are concerned that giving the pharmacy board regulatory power over PBMs may create tensions and conflicts of interest for the pharmacy board.21 Indeed, the antitrust laws recognize that there is a real danger that regulatory boards composed of market participants may pursue their own interests rather than those of the state.22 We urge the Mississippi legislature to consider 19 We note that most professions, including medical professions, have self-regulatory boards whose principal function is to regulate the activities of their own profession. In many cases, the membership of these boards also includes members from outside the pr ofession to represent the public interest, including consumers' interests.

See generally HHS Dental Hygienists Report at 73,165 (HHS noted that \"[t]he dental hygiene profession has progressed less quickly than most other health professions. This is largely due to the regulation of the pr ofession of dentistry, a condition that is unusual in health regulation since most other professions are provided with autonomy in governing their constituents.\" HHS further noted \"T here is a demonstrated, adversarial relationship in organized professional circles between dental professionals and hygiene professionals.\"). 22 See Patrick v. Burget, 486 U.S. 94, 100 (1988); Opinion of the Commission, North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners at 9 (Feb. 8, 2011), available at: 5this concern. (b) Information Disclosures to the Ph armacy Board and Others SB-2445 gives the Pharmacy Board comple te discretion over what information PBMs must provide and allows the board to share that information with pharmacies and health plans. Moreover, there are no confiden tiality provisions for sensitive financial or business information.23 The bill requires each PBM to file an annual statement with the Pharmacy Board. This statement \"shall be on forms prescribed by the board and shall include: (a) A financial statement of the or ganization, including its balance sheet and income statement for the preceding year; and (b) Any other information relating to the operations of the pharmacy benefit manage r required by the board under this section.\" 24 Moreover, the bill authorizes the Board to \"provide a copy of the financial examination to the person or entity who provides or operates th e health insurance plan or to a pharmacist or pharmacy.\" 25 These provisions could result in sharing co mpetitively sensitive cost information among competing pharmacies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In particular, such information sharing could undermine competition between pharmacies to be included in PBM networks and between pharmaceutical ma nufacturers to offer discounts to PBMs. Both outcomes could raise prescription drug pr ices for consumers. We note, however, that if there are appropriate confidentiality safeguards in plac e, health plan sponsors (and their consultants) may find specific cost inform ation helpful as they seek to select among PBMs, understand their enrollees ' prescription drug use, a nd ensure that they are receiving appropriate rebates from PBMs. In some circumstances, sharing information among competitors may increase the likelihood of collusion or coordination on matters such as price or output. 26 The antitrust agencies have explained how coordinated interaction harms cons umers: coordinated http://www ftc.gov/os/adjpro/d9343/110208commopinion.pdf . 23 But see SB-2445 at \u00a7 73-21-107 (4) (unlike the provisions related to PBMs, this Section prevents the pharmacy board, without written consent, from inspecting drug wholesalers' \"(a) Financial data; (b) Sales data other than shipment data; or (c) Pricing data\"). 24 SB-2445 at FTC/DOJ GUIDELINES FOR COLLABORATIONS AMONG COMPETITORS \u00a73.31(b) (discussing potential harms to competition when competitors exchange or disclose sensitive business information). See also DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION , STATEMENTS OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT POLICY IN HEALTH CARE, Statement 6 (Aug. 1996) (same); available at http://www.ftc. gov/bc/healthcare/industryguide/policy/hlth3s.pdf ; Letter from FTC Staff to Sen. James L. Seward, New York Senate (Mar. 31, 2009) (disclosure of sensitive business data in one market segment may chill competition in multiple market segments); available at http://www ftc.gov/os/2009 /04/V0 90006newyorkpbm.pdf ; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION , HORIZONTAL MERGER GUIDELINES \u00a77 (2010) (describing anticompetitive effects of coordination among rivals), available at http://ftc.gov/os/2010/08/100819hmg.pdf [hereinafter FTC/DOJ HORIZONTAL MERGER GUIDELINES ]. 6interaction \"can blunt a firm 's incentive to offer customers better deals by undercutting the extent to which such a move would wi n business away from rivals\" and \"also can enhance a firm's incentive to raise prices by assuaging the fear that such a move would lose customers to rivals.\"27 For example, pharmacies may compete with one another by offering deeper discounts or lower dispensing fees in order to be included in a PBM's limited network or to become a preferred provider. Knowing that rivals will see, a nd can respond to, one's prices can dilute incentives to bid aggressi vely. Thus, depending on the information the Board requires, the disclosure provisions may undercut the most efficient pharmacy network contracts, leading to higher prescription drug prices. Similarly, if the Pharmacy Board requires PBMs to provide detailed information about their rebate arrangements with pharm aceutical manufacturers, then tacit collusion among the manufacturers ma y be more feasible. 28 Absent such knowledge, manufacturers have powerful incentives to bid aggressively for formulary position, because preferential formulary treatment offe rs the prospect of substantially increased sales. Disclosure of such confidential fi nancial and business information thus may raise the price that Mississippi consumers pa y for pharmaceutical coverage by harming competition among pharmaceutical companies for preferred formulary treatment. In sum, allowing the Pharmacy Board to demand confidential business information from PBMs and to disclose it presents a significant threat to competition that could lead to higher prescription drug prices for Mississippi consumers. (c) Requirement that Nonresident Pharmacies have a Mississippi-licensed Pharmacist-in-Charge Section 73-21-106 of the Mississippi Code currently requires a nonresident pharmacy to register with the board. In addition, the nonresident pharmacy, among other things, must \"[c]omply with al l lawful directions and reque sts for information from the regulatory or licensing agency of the state in wh ich it is licensed . . . [and] maintain at all times a valid unexpired license, permit or registration to conduct the pharmacy in compliance with the laws of the state in wh ich it is a resident.\" SB-2445 would amend this section to add the requirement that the pharmacist-in-charge of a nonresident pharmacy \"hold a Mississippi pharmacist license, be licensed to practice pharmacy in the state of residence of the nonr esident pharmacy, and be curren t and in good standing with the licensing boards of both states.\" 29 27 FTC/DOJ HORIZONTAL MERGER GUIDELINES \u00a77. 28 See, e.g., Svend Albaek et al., Government Assisted Oligopoly Coordination? A Concrete Case, 45 J. INDUS . ECON. 429 (1997). 29 A nonresident pharmacy is \"Any phar macy located outside this state that ships, mails or delivers, in any manner, controlled substances or prescription or legend drugs or devices into this state.\" SB-2445, Section 73-21-106. 7 8 This additional requiremen t could increase the costs of mail-order pharmacies that provide pharmacy services to Mississippi c onsumers and potentially reduce the incentives or increase the costs for health plans and PBMs to offer mail order options to beneficiaries. As noted above, in its 2005 PBM Study, the FTC found that the prices for a common basket of prescription drugs di spensed by PBM-owned mail order pharmacies were typically lower than the pr ices charged by retail pharmacies.30 Similarly, a Maryland study found that statutory impediments to the use of mail-order pharmacies for maintenance drugs can be costly for a State and its citizens. 31 In the absence of countervailing health and safe ty rationales for the new licen sure requirement, FTC staff urges the Mississippi legislat ure to consider carefully whether requiring a nonresident pharmacy to employ a Mississippi-licensed pharmacist could unnecessarily hamper affordable access to pharmaceutical goods and services. Conclusion Our analysis of SB-2445 suggests that its passage may increase pharmaceutical prices for Mississippi consumer s. FTC staff recommends that the Mississippi legislature seriously consider whether there are benef its to consumers from the additional, more restrictive regulations in SB-2445 that would outweigh the competitive harm and consumer costs identified herein. Finally, FT C staff recommends that if the Mississippi legislature concludes PBMs should be subject to additional oversight, that the legislature consider giving additional authority to the Mississippi Commissioner of Insurance rather than to the Board of Pharmacy.

United States Court of Appeals For the Eighth Circuit ___________________________ No. 18 -2926 ___________________________ Pharmaceutical Care Management Association Plaintiff - Appellant v. Mylynn Tufte, in her official capacity as the State Health Officer of North Dakota; Mark J. Hardy, in his official capacity as the Executive Director of the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy; Steven P. Irsfeld, in his official capacity as President of the North Dak ota Board of Pharmacy; Wayne Stenehjem, in his official capacity as the Attorney General of North Dakota Defendants - Appellees ____________ Appeal from United States District Court for the District of North Dakota - Bismarck ____________ Submitted: October 15, 2019 Filed: August 7, 2020 ____________ Before SMITH, Chief Judge, GRUENDER and BENTON, Circuit Judges. ____________ GRUENDER, Circuit Judge. This case concerns Pharmaceutical Care Management Association's (\"PCMA\") claim that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq., , and Modernization \"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w -101 et seq. , preempt two sectio ns of the North Dakota Century Code (the \"legislation\") regulating the relationship between pharmacies, pharmacy benefits managers (\"PBMs\"), and other third parties that finance personal health services . After PCMA and the State of North Dakota1 cross -moved for summary judgment, the district court determined that only one provision in the legislation was preempted by Medicare Part D and entered judgment in favor of North Dakota on the remainder of PCMA's claims. We affirm in part, reverse in par t, and remand with directions that judgment be entered in favor of PCMA. PCMA is a national trade association that represents PBMs . PBMs are third- party health plan administrators that manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of health insurance plans. In this role, PBMs negotiate prescription drug prices with drug manufacturers and pharmacies, create networks of pharmacies to fill prescriptions for insured individuals, and process insurance claims when prescriptions are filled. In 2017, North Dakot a passed N.D. Cent ury Code sections 19-02.1 -16.1 and 19.02.1- 16.2, which, according to North Dakota , \"sought to define the rights of pharmacist[s] in relation to [PBMs], and to regulate certain practices by PBMs.\" The legislation regulates the fees PBMs and \"third- party payer[s]\" may charge pharmacies, N.D. Cent. Code \u00a7 19-02.1 -16.1(2); limits what copayments PBM may charge , id. \u00a7 19-02.1-16.1(4); dictates the quality metrics PBMs and third- party payers may use to evaluate pharmacies and structures how they may reward performance , id. \u00a7\u00a7 19-02.1- 16.1(3), (11), -16.2(4) ; prohibits , subject to certain exceptions, PBMs from having \"an ownership interest in a patient assistance program and a mail orde r specialty pharmacy, \" id. \u00a7 19.02.1 -16.2(3); 1PCMA sued Mylynn Tufte, State Health Officer of North Dakota, Mark Hardy, Executive Director of the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy, Fran Gronberg, President of the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy, and Wayne Stenehjem, Attorney General of North Dakota, in their official capacities. Because of the nature of PCMA's cla ims, w e refer to the defendants collectively as \"North Dakota .\" Appellate Case: Entry ID: 4943050 -3- regulates benefits provision s and plan structure s, id. \u00a7\u00a7 19-02.1-16.1(3), (4), (5) (8), (9), (11), -16.2(5) ; and requires certain disclosures on the part of PBMs and prohibits PBMs from setting limits on information pharmacists may provide patients, id. \u00a7\u00a7 19-02.1-16.1(6), (7) , (10) , -16.2(2) . A PBM or third- party payer that violates any section of the legislation is guilty of a class B misdemeanor. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 19-02.1- 16.1(12), -16.2(6). Shortly after the legislation's enactment in 2017, PCMA filed a complaint seeking a declaration of preemption and an injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the legislation. At summary judgment, t he district court determined that none of the statutory provisions were preempted by ERISA and that only one of the provisions was preempted by Medicare Part D. PCMA appeals, renewing its argument that both ERISA and Medicare Part D preempt the entire legislation. We review de novo the district court's preempt ion and statutory interpretation rulings. Pharm . Ass'n v. Rutledge , 891 F.3d 2018). With certain limited exceptions, ERISA preempts \"any and all State laws insofar as they may now o r hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a) (emphasis added). \"The breadth of this section is well known,\" Rutledge , 891 F.3d at 1112, and courts have struggled for decades to cabin its reach in order to prevent the clause from becoming \" limitless, \" Gobeille v. Liberty Mut. Ins. , 577 U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 936, 943 (2016); N.Y. State Conf . of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins ., 514 U.S. 645, 65 5-56 (1995) (rejecting an \"uncritical literalism\" that extends ERISA's preemption clause to the \"furthest stretch of its indeterminacy\" ); see also Cal. Div. of Labor Standards Enf 't v. Dillingham Const r., N.A., Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 335 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring) (counseling courts to avoid reading the clause too broadly because , \"as many a curbstone philosopher has observed, everything is related to everything else\"). Endeavoring to clarify ERISA's \"unhelpful text,\" Travelers Ins., 514 U.S. at 656, the Supreme Court has determined the clause preempts a state law that \"relates to\" an ERISA an ERISA plan, id. Here, we need not address the \"connection with\" element of the analysis because we conclude the legislation is preempted due to its impermissible \"reference to\" (8th Cir. 2017) (\"Where a State law is preempted because it has a prohibited 'reference to' ERISA or ERISA plans, we need not reach the question of whether it is also preempted under the 'connection with' prong of the analysis.\"). A state law has an impermissible \"reference to\" ERISA plans where it (1) \"acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans\" or (2) \"where the existence of ERISA plans is essential to the law's operation.\" Gobeille , 136 S. Ct. at 943. PCMA asserts that the legislation is preempted because it imposes requirement s by reference to ERISA plans through its definitions of \"third- party payers\" and \"plan sponsors. \" According to PCMA, these references \"ensure[] that the existence of an ERISA plan triggers application\" of the legislation's provisions. The district court disagreed, determining that, because the legislation also covers entities that are not ERISA plans, it neither acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans nor does it make the existence of an ERISA plan essential to the operation of the regulatory scheme . We agree with PCMA that the legislation is preempted be cause its references to \"third -party payers\" and \"plan sponsors\" 19-02.1-16.1 -16.2 regulate \" [p]harmacy benefits manger[s]\" and define a \"[p]harmacy benefits manager\" as \"a person that performs pharmacy . . hird- party payer\" is defined as \"an organization other than the patient or health care provider involved in the financing of personal health services. \" Id. \u00a7 19- 03.6- 01(6). This definition includes ERISA plans, which are necessarily \"involved in the financing of personal health servic es\" and are distinct from \"the patient or health care provider.\" See id. ; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1) (explaining that, for the purposes of ERISA, an employee benefit plan is one that is established \"for the purpose of providing\" \"medical, surgical, or hospital c are or benefits\") . The legislation also Appellate [p]lan sponsor [s],\" which it defines as \"the employer in the case of an employee benefit plan established or maintained by a single employer, or the employee organization in the case of a plan established or maintained by an employee organization. \" N.D. Cent . Code \u00a7 19-03.6 -01(5) (emphasis added). This definition is verbatim from ERISA, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(16)(B) , and these \"plan qualify as ERISA fiduciaries , see id. \u00a7 1002(21)(A). Two of our prior cases dictate that regulating by implicit reference to ERISA plans results in preemption. First, in Gerhart , we determined that an Iowa statute was preempted because it had a prohibited \"reference to\" ERISA. 852 F.3d at 729 - 30. Although we found that the Iowa act at issue contained an \"express reference\" to ERISA, see id. at 729, we also noted that \" the Iowa law . . . makes implicit reference to ERISA through regulation of PBMs who administer benefits for 'covered entities,' which, by definition, include health benefit plans and employers, labor unions, or other groups 'that provide[] health coverage ,'\" id. (emphasis added). We explained that because \"[t]hese entities are necessarily subject to ERISA regulation ,\" the requirements \"necessarily affect [] ERISA plans, \" and, as a result, the Iowa law contained an \"impermissible reference to\" ERISA . Id. at 729-30. One year l ater, in Rutledge , we f ollowed this reasoning in evaluating an Arkansas statute that was \"similar in purpose and effect\" to the Iowa law at issue in Gerhart. See Rutledge , 891 F.3d at 1112. There, w e determined the Arkansas law contained an impermissible \"reference to\" ERISA plans , see id. at 1112 -13, because the challenged law regulated PBMs that administered a \"pharmacy benefits plan or program,\" see Ark. Code. Ann. \u00a7 17- 92-507(a)(7) (2017), which in turn was defined as any plan or program that \"pays fo r . . . pharmacist services, \" id. \u00a7 17-92-507(a)(9). We concluded the Arkansas law \"implicitly referred to ERISA by regulating the conduct of PBMs administering or managing pharmacy benefits\" on behalf of ERISA plans. See Rutledge , 891 Gerhart and , so too here . The North Dakota legislation's definitions of and references to \"pharmacy benefits manager,\" \"third -party payer ,\" and \"plan sponsor\" the legislation's provisions apply to plans \"subject to ERISA regulation. \" Id. \"Because benefits affected by [the statute] are provided by ERISA -covered programs, the requirements imposed for the management and administration of these benefits necessarily affects ERISA plans.\" Gerhart, 852 F.3d at 729. Thus, the existence of an ERISA plan is essential to the law's operation because \" it cannot be said that the . . . law functions irrespective of the existence of an ERISA plan.\" Id. at 729- 30 (internal quotation marks, ellipses, and brackets omitted) . As the State of Arkansas did in Rutledge , North Dakota argues that Gerhart should be limited to its consideration of the Iowa law 's \"express reference\" to ERISA plans and that Gerhart's \"implicit reference\" analysis is dicta inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent.2 But we have already rejected this argument. Rutledge , 891 F.3d at 1112 (\"The state argues that Gerhart should be limited to its consideration of the Iowa Act's 'express reference' to ERISA, and that Gerhart 's 'implicit reference' analysis i s dicta inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. We disagree .\"). Instead, Gerhart and Rutledge control, and a statute that implicit ly regulates ERISA plans as part of its regulatory scheme is preempted by ERISA and 2Citing Dillingham Construction, 519 U.S. at 325, North Dakota argues that our cases construing the scope of ERISA's preemption clause conflict with Supreme Court precedent. The State sugge sts that if a law regulates a class of third-pa rty administrators or claim processors whose customers merely include but are not limited to ERISA plans, it logically follows that the law does not act immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans and that the existence of ERISA plans is not essential to the law's operation. See also Pharm . Care Mgmt. Ass'n v. District of Columbia , 613 F.3d 179, 189- 90 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (reasoning similarly) ; Pharm . Care Mgmt. Ass'n v. Rowe , 429 F.3d 294, 304 (1st Cir. 2005) (same) . The Supreme Court recently granted a writ of certiorari in Rutledge , 589 U.S. ---, 140 S. Ct. 812 (2020) (mem.), to resolve this question . But regardless of whether Gerhart and Rutledge were rightly decided, we are bound by those panel decisions unless they are abrogated by the Supreme Court or overruled by this circuit sitting en banc . See Mader v. United States, 654 F.3d 794, 800 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc). Appellate 6 Date Filed: 08/07/2020 Entry ID: cannot be saved merely because the re ference also includes entities not covered by ERISA . See id. (rejecting Arkansas's argument that \"we are not completely bound by\" the Gerhart panel's reasoning). Accordingly, the North Dakota legislation is preempted because it \"relates to\" ERISA plans \"by regulating the conduct of PBMs administering or managing pharmacy benefits. \" See Rutledge , 891 F.3d at 1112 ; see also Metro. Life Ins. v Massachusetts , 471 U.S. 724, 739 (1985) (\"Even indirect state action bearing on private pensions may encroach upon the area of exclusive federal concern.\" (brackets omitted) ); Express Scripts, Inc. v. Wenzel, 262 F.3d 829, 833 (8th Cir. 2001) (\"State laws that are not targeted at ERISA plans, but which indirectly force a plan administrator to make a particular decision or take a particular action may be held to 'relate to' employee benefit plans.\") . Next, North Dakota urge s in a footnote at the end of its argument regarding ERISA preemption that, if we find the legislation to be preempted, we should \"remand for a determination of which provisions are saved from preemption under ERISA's Savings Clause.\" The district court did not address this issue and North Dakota provides no argument as to which provisions might be saved by the savings clause. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A). We therefore conclude that North Dakota has waived this issue. See Mahler v. First Dakota Title L td. P'ship, 931 F.3d 799, 807 (8th Cir. 2019) (finding an issue waived where plaintiff mentioned it only in passing and did not include the issue in the statement of issues); Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc. , 680 F.3d 1316, 1318 -19 (11th Cir. 2012) (holding that appellee's failure to raise an affirmative defense on appeal waives any right to claim such a defense on appeal).

And because Gerhart and Rutledge dictate that ERISA preempts the North Dakota legislation in its entirety, we need not address that determination. See Duffner v. City of St. Peters, 930 F.3d 973, 976 (8th Cir. 2019) (noting that \"[w]e may affirm on any ground supported by the record\").

In Opposition to North Dakota Prescription Drug Price Transparency Legislation August 17 , 2020 Position: The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) opposes the North Dakota draft transparency legislation, which would require significant reporting mandates , will not help patients , could threaten access to needed prescription medications , and potentially chill the innovation of future treatments. Discussions about cost and affordability of medicines are important. N o patient should have to worry about whether they can afford the healthcare they need. However, the notion that spending on medicines is the primary driver of healthcare cost growth is false and ignores cost savings that medicin es provide to the healthcare system overall. Medicines lead to fewer physician visits, hospitializations, surgeries and other preventatible procedures - all of which translate to lower healthcare co sts. New medicines are making crucial contributions to medical advances, changing the direction of healthcare as we know it. With more tha n 4,500 medicines in the pipeline (74% which have the potential to be first in class medicines and 42% of which could be personalized medicines ), patients have greater hope than ever before. However, this transparency bill is likely to skew important discussions of policy issues in ways that are systematically biased against innovation and ignores the value of medicines to patients , the overall healthcare system , and the economy of North Dakota. Proposals to mandate additional disclosure of proprietary i nformation by biopharmaceutical companies would neither benefit patients nor decrease healthcare c osts. The biopharmaceutical industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the United States. Companies currently report extensive information on costs, sales, clinical trials, and total research and development (R&D) expenditures in 10 -K filings . Proposals to mandate public disclosure of additional confidential and proprietary information by biopharmaceutical companies ignore the large amount of information already publicly reported on an annual basis by companies and are based on the faulty assu mption that prescription drug spending is the major driver of increases in healthcare costs. The reporting requirement s for manufacturers do not reflect the total investment of industry because of the long- term nature of research and development. Manufacturers pursue research efforts that include many failures and iterations on the path to development of a single approved drug. In fact, according to Tuft's Center for Study of Drug Development (CSDD), only 12% of medicines in the pipeline make it through the approval process by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1 An 88% failure rate underscores how expensive and risky drug development is. Drug costs are the only costs in the health care system that diminish over time due to market changes , such as brand to brand competition and patent expirations . It is important to note that medicines are the only part of the health care system where costs decrease over time. When brand name medicines face brand competition, or when they lose their patent protection and generic drugs become available, prices drop, often significantly. In fact, it is projected that from 2019 -2023, there will be approximately $105B in savings due to competition from generic and biosimilar products as patents for brand 3 IQVIA Institute Drug Channels Institute 4 Berkeley Research Group (BRG).

Accessed February 2018. Analysis includes individuals with any source of health care coverage, public or private; this includes individuals who had health coverage without coverage f or prescription drugs, which can be expected to account for less than 2% of those with health coverage. 8 http://lab.express- scripts.com/lab/drug -trend -report 9 North Dakota job data 2 medicines expire . 2 In addition , nearly 90% of all medicines dispensed in the United States are generic and cost penni es on the dollar.3 Generics offer a cheaper alternative for patients when their healthcare provider deems a generic appropriate. One component of health spend that is not decreasing, however, is healthcare insurance, which is seeing significant increases instead . Deductibles for patients have tripled and coinsurance has doubled between 2007 -2017. Kaiser showed patient costs are increasing faster than insurer's cost. Health insurance and plan administration costs are rising at more than twice the rate of drug spending. According to new research from the Berkeley Research Group (BRG), rebates, discounts, and fees paid by manufacturers are on the increase while the share received by manufacturers has decreased over t ime.4 In fact, nearly half (46 %) of total spending on brand medicines went to the supply chain and other entities in 2018. This is a 13 %- point increase from 2013 , when other stakeholders retained 33 % of brand medicine spending. This data reaffirms that we need to look at the entire supply chain in order to solve patient affordability challenges . Misaligned incentives must be fixed in the supply chain, including the broken rebate system, to ensure patients benefit at the pharmacy counter from the significant discounts and rebates. In addition, brand and generic biopharmaceutical companies, unlike other sectors of healthcare, rebate $37 million in rebates to the state of North Dakota and federal government in 2018, which is 5 0% of total Medicaid spend on prescription drugs in the state.5 If the intent of the North Dakota legislation is to improve access and affordability to needed medicines, the language of the bill is misguided. The legislation does nothing to address how much consumers ultimately pay for a medicine , an amount determined by insurers , not biopharmaceutical companies. This legislation should do something to help patients afford their prescription medicines, such as passing on the rebates directly to the patients at the point of sale at the pharmacy counter . Instead, these rebates are going to the plans and other supply chain stakeholders. Recent data shows that insurers are increasingly requiring patients to pay exorbitant out- of-pocket costs to access the medicines they need, far more than other health care services covered by an enrollee's health plan. A recent IQVIA study that looked at out - of-pocket patient spend for brand name medicines from 2 015-2019 and showed that patient 's spend on deductibles and coninsurance accounted for more than 2/3 of total out -of-pocket spend for brand medicines in five out of seven therapy areas examined For two therapy areas (oncolo gy and multiple sclerosis), it accounted for more than 90%.6 This occurance is contrary to the purpose of insurance \u2014to spread the costs of health care utilization so that patients can access needed care, including medicines. Today, a patient pays only about 3% for out -of-pocket hospital costs , but 13% or more for their medicines.7 Additionally, insurers are increasing utilization management techniques to aggressively restrict a patient's use of medicine. Currently, three major pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate steep discounts on prescription dr ugs for more than 70 % of all prescriptions filled in the United States \u2014Express Scripts alone covers 90 million American s.8 The biopharmaceutical industry supports over 1 ,130 jobs in North Dakota , with a generous annual compensation of $75,891 per year , as compared to the average job salary in North Dakota of $56,049 .9 Furthermore, m ore than $14.4M in revenue is generated in both state and federal taxes.

Prescription medicines have transformed the trajectory of many debilitating diseases and conditions, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, and heart disease, resulting in decreased death rates, improved health outcomes, and better quality of life for patients. Better use of medicines could eliminate up to $213 billion in US health care costs annually, which represents 8% of the nation's health care spending.10 Therefore, instead of focusing on reporting of information that does nothing to help the patient, perhaps the conversation should focus on better use of medicines, which yields significant health gains by avoiding the need for other, more costly, medical s ervices. This North Dakota legislation is not the way to accomplish improved access and affordability, therefore, PhRMA respectfully urges North Dakota lawmakers to oppose this bill . The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) represents the country's leading innovative biopharmaceutical research companies, which are devoted to discovering and developing medicines that enable patients to live longer, healthier and more productive lives. Since 2000, PhRMA member companies have invested more than $900 billion in the search for new treatments and cures, including an estimated $79.6 billion in 2018 alone.

Sincerely, Alex Sommer, J.D. Prime Therapeutics Alexander.sommer@primetherape utics.com MEMORANDUM TO: Representative George Keiser , Chairman of the Interim Health Care Committee FROM: Prime Therapeutics LLC DATE: 8/13/2020 RE: Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill Draft - Disclosure of Pharmacy Benefits Manager Information to the State Board of Pharmacy INTRODUCTION As currently drafted, the Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager (\"PBM\") to disclose competitive financial data to the state board of pharmacy. The bill also provides the state board of pharmacy with discretion to disseminate the data. This memo analyzes the problems associated with the disclosure and recommends the data be classified as a \"confidential record\" and be disclose d only to the Insurance Commissioner. DISCUSSION A. The Disclosure Requirement The bill provides in pertinent part as follows: 1. On or before April first of each year, a pharmacy benefits manager providing services for a health care plan shall file a report with the board . The report must contain the following information for the previous calendar year: a. The aggregated rebates, fees, price protection payments, and any other payments collected from each drug manufacturer; b. The aggr egated dollar amount of rebates, price protection payments, fees, and any other payments collected from each drug manufacturer which were passed to health insurers; c. The aggregated fees, price concessions, penalties, effective rates, and any other financ ial incentive collected from pharmacies which were passed to enrollees at the point of sale; and d. The aggregated dollar amount of rebates, price protection payments, fees, and any other payments collected from drug manufacturers which were retained as revenue by the pharmacy benefits manager. 2. Reports submitted by pharmacy benefits managers under this section may not disclose the identity of a specific health benefit plan or enrollee, the prices charged for specific drugs or classes of drugs, or the amount of any rebates or fees provided for specific drugs or classes of drugs. 3. Within thirty days of receipt of a report under this section, the board shall provide the reported information to the commissioner in a format ready for publication on the commissioner's website. The information the board provides to the commissioner may not disclose or tend to disclose proprietary or confidential information of any pharmacy benefit manager.1 B. Problem of Disclosing Information to a Competitor A PBM's disclosure of its competitive financial information to the state board of pharmacy may lead to a Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") complaint or lawsuits resulting from an anticompetitive restriction on trade . This is because t he state board of pharmacy is made up of pharmacists, the direct competitors of PBMs. Pharmacists and PBMs are competitors in two different areas of the prescription drug market.2 First, pharmacists and PBMs negotia te prices that plan sponsors will pay for prescription drugs at retail pharmacies; the lower the price that PBMs negotiate, the lower the profits for pharmacies.3 Second, retail pharmacies directly compete with PBM -owned mail -order pharmacies for prescription drug sales; the more prescription drugs sold by mail -order pharmacies , the fewer drugs sold by retail pharmacies.4 As currently drafted, the Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill gives the pharmacist -controlled board of pharmacy the opportunity to exploit the disclosure of the PBMs' competitive data in ways that benefit pharmacies at the expense of PBMs. Wielding the competitive financial information disclosed by PBMs, the board could establish various rules or practices that improve pharmacists' bargaining position as they negotiate with PBMs for retail prescription drug prices.5 Similarly, the board could establish rules that restrict cost -saving practices that attract consumers to mail- order pharmacies and away from retail pharmacies.6 In a letter addressing the likely consequences of allowing a state board of pharmacy to regulate PBMs and gather competitive financial data from PBMs , the FTC opined: Because pharmacists and PBMs have a competitive, and at times, adversarial relationship, we are concerned that giving the pharmacy board regulatory power over PBMs may create tensions and conflicts of interest for the pharmacy board. Indeed, the antitrust laws recognize that there is a real danger that regulatory boards composed of market participants may pursue their own interests rather than those of the state . . . . [A]llow ing the Pharmacy Board to demand confidential business 1 Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill, Pages 4- 5 (emphasis added). 2 Exhibit 1 (Joanna Shepherd, The Fox Guarding the Henhouse: The Regulation of Pharmacy Benefit Managers by a Market Adversary , 9 NW J.L. & SOC. POL'Y.1 (2013), p. 9 ). 3 Id. 4 Id. 5 Id. at 10. 6 Id. information from P BMs and to disclose it presents a significant threat to competition that could lead to higher prescription drug prices.7 Similarly, the FTC has opposed regulatory boards composed of market participants in other industries. In 2010, the FTC filed an administrative complaint charging the North Carolina Dental Board with violations of federal antitrust law. The FTC alleged that the board's concerted action to exclude non- dentists from the market for teeth whitening services in North Carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of competition. At the time, the dental board consisted of six licensed dentists, one licensed hygienist, and one consumer member. In its analysis of the regulatory framework of the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners, the FTC stated that when a state regulatory body is controlled by participants in the very industry i t purports to regulate, \"common sense and economic theory . . . dicta te the conclusion that Board actions in this area could be self interested.\" 8 In response to the FTC's administrative complaint, the North Carolina Dental Board argued for the state-action exemption from antitrust law and moved to dismiss the complaint . The state -action exemption provides immunity for (1) public actors performing state - mandated activities or (2 ) private actors working under the oversight of the state. Ultimately, in North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. F.TC., 574 U .S. 494 ( 2015), the United States Supreme Court held that the North Carolina Dental Board was a sovereign entity controlled by active market participants that did not receive active supervision by the state, and therefore, the board's anticompetitive actions were not entitled to immunity from antitrust law. As was suggested by the FTC and Supreme Court in North Carolina Dental, it is safe to assume that the members of a professional board that are competitors to a group they are charged with regulating may act in their own self -interest. Requiring the disclosure of a PBM's competitive and proprietary financial data to the state board of pharmacy creates an inherent conflict of interest by giving pharmacists an advantage over their natural competitors in the marketplace . Ultimately, this may lead a potential lawsuit or FTC complaint. To avoid the inherent conflict of interest i n providing financial data to a competitor , the Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill could simply require a PBM to disclose the data to the Insurance Commissioner - a neutral third party. Note that the Insurance Commissioner is already reviewing PBM's competitive, proprietary financial data for other reasons. 9 Also note that in states that have adopted similar legislation, the reports go to the insurance regulatory authority.10 7 Exhibit 2 (Letter from Susan S. DeSanti et al., Director Fed, Trade Comm'n, et. Al. to Mark Formby, Representative, Mississippi House of Representatives (Mar. 22, 2011)). 8 Exhibit 1 (Joanna Shepherd at p. 10 (quoting Opinion of the Commission, NC Bd. of Dental Examiners, Docket No.9343 (Feb. 8. 2011)). 9 See N.D.C.C. 26.1 -27.1-06 (2) -(3) (\"[T]he commissioner shall examine any contract between the covered entity and a pharmacy benefits manager and any related record . . . t he covered entity shall disclose annually to the commissioner the benef its of the payment received by the pharmacy benefits manager received under any contract with a pharmacy benefits manager . . . [a]ny information disclosed to the commissioner under this section is considered a trade secret under chapter 47 -25.1). 10 See e.g. , Minnesota (Minn. Stat. \u00a7 62W.06), 1369.502), 92-505), and Iowa (Iowa Code \u00a7510C.2) . C. Protection from Open Records Requests Reports containing a PBM's competitive financial data should not be subject to open records requests. As currently drafted, the Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill gives the state board of pharmacy the discretion to disclose a PBM 's competitive financial data. In pertinent part the bill provides: 4. A report received by the board is an exempt record as defined by 44 -04-17.1.11 In North Dakota \"all records of a public entity are public records, open and accessible for inspection . . . [e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided by law.\" 12 Because the open records law does not apply \"if otherwise specifically provided by law,\" public records need not be disclosed if they fall within a specific exemption from the open rec ords law. 13 There are 3 classes of public records under ND law : (1) Confidential - disclosure of these documents is generally prohibited; (2) Exempt - disclosure is discretionary; and (3) Subject to open records law - disclosure of these documents is required.14 As drafted, the reports containing PBMs' competitive financial data are \"exempt records.\" Therefore, it is in the pharmacy board's discretion to disclose a PBM's competitive financial data via an open records request. As explained in Section B, supra, the members of the board of pharmacy are competitors of PBMs, and therefore, may act in a manner that disadvantages PBMs. Indeed, imagine a scenario where a pharmacist or drug manufacturer makes an open records request for the competitive financial data . It's not hard to imagine the board coming up with some viable reason to provide the information. If, in fact, the board does disclose PBMs' data on rebates, fees, and price protection paym ents via an open records request, it will reduce PBMs' bargaining power to negotiate discounts with pharmacies and rebates with drug manufacturers because both pharmacies and drug manufacturers are less likely to offer the same price terms to PBMs when they know rival pharmacies and manufacturers can learn the specifics of the arrangement. Ultimately, the open records request disclosure of the competitive data would likely lead to reduced discounts and rebates that PBMs can pass on to consumers and health plan sponsors. Therefore, the reports containing PBMs' competitive financial data should not be classified as \"exempt records\" but rather \"confidential records\" - not subject to open records requests. D. ERISA Preemption The legislation contemplated in the Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill is likely preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq. 11 Prescription Drug Cost Transparency Bill, Page 6 (emphasis added). 12 N.D.C.C. \u00a7 44-04-18. 13 See ND AG Open Records Manual, August 2019, Page 23. 14 Id. at 24 -25 (citing \u00a7 N.D.C.C. 44- 04-17.1(3) and \u00a7 44 -04017(5)). is the proposed legislation \"relate s to\" ERISA plans \"b y regulating the conduct of PBMs administering or managing pharmacy benefits.\"15 On August 7, 2020 in Tufte , the Eighth Circuit struck down North Dakota legislation from 2017 which \"sought to define the rights of pharmacist[s] in relation to [PBMs], and to regulate certain practices by PBMs.\"16 Specifically, the legislation required disclosures of drug pricing and keeping the rei mbursement rate above certain levels. Ultimately, the Court remanded the case to the lower court with directions to enter judgment in favor of PCMA because the Court concluded the 2017 legislation \"is preempted because it relates to ERISA plans by regulat ing the conduct of PBMs administering or managing pharmacy benefits. \"17 Pursuant to the Tufte decision, as written the PBM disclosure requirements is likely preempted by ERISA. Prime would like to work with the committee to avoid a similar preemption result with respect to the PBM disclosure requirements. CONCLUSION Granting the state board of pharmacy control to collect PBMs' competitive financial data creates an inherent conflict of interest by giving a group of pharmacist s regulatory control of their natural competitor s in the marketplace. Under the current reporting scheme in the Prescription Drug Transparency Bill , the board of pharmacy will have the opportunity to weaken PB Ms' competitive positions, and in turn, benefit pharmacies. This issue could likely be resolved by requiring the data disclosure to the Insurance Commissioner and classifying the competitive financial data as \"confidential record s\". Prime wishes to continue working with the committee on this bill to avoid future PBM litigation. ATTACHMENTS 1.

I appreciate the opportunity to share with the committee a few comments on the current draft of the Drug Price Transparency legislation. As you know, many states have passed legislation aimed at improving transparency in drug pricing and accordingly, to address the issue of skyrocketing drug prices. Sanford Health recognizes the importance of providing North Dakota consumers with affordable, access to quality health care services and treatments. Prescription drugs play an important role in the management of health, particularly for those with chronic illnesses. The proposed bill intends to facilitate the disclosure of some of the data needed to address and understand why prescription drug prices are rising , and hopefully provide incentiv es for the distribution chain to act in a fiscally responsible way . Just recently (May, 2020) the Minnesota legislature passed Drug Price Transparency legislation. While the legislation does not plac e a cap on drug prices, however, it does require drug manufacturers to provide data to the state conce rning drug price increases, new drug pricing and other information. As part of the Minnesota legislation, the Insurance Commissioner will annually report on the implementation of this section including its effectiveness in promoting transparency in pharmaceutical pricing; enhancing the understanding of pharmaceutical spending trends; and assisting the state and other payers in managing pharmaceutical costs We are committed to working with North Dakota on t he critical issue of drug price transparency and this legislation. In that spirit, we offer the following suggestions: 1) Consider adding provisions requiring wholesalers to disclose their business practices in a similar manner as the Pharmacy Benefit Manag er (PBM). This will provide information and awareness of unknown discounts and rebates offered and retained by the pharmacies 2) Consider including another entity in the North Dakota prescription drug chain, Pharmacy Service Administration Organizations (PSAO) into this legislation. A Pharmacy Service Administration Organization (PSAO) is a contracting entity hired by pharmacies to manage their PBM contracts. While I cannot speak to all existing relationships between PSAO's and pharmacies, in our current n etwork, we have approximately 76% of all pharmacies contracted through these organizations. That represents 159 of the 209 network pharmacies. Where these organizations can provide critical support in contracting and negotiation, there can also be conf licts of interest due to ownership influence. 2 | P a g e Revised 8/19 In regard to PSAOs, West Virginia attempted to legislate requirements of disclosure and transparency in these arrangements to support their local pharmacies.1 Maryland passed a similar bill which has been cha llenged on the constitutionality of this measure. Despite these challenges, many other states are attempting to pass similar legislation that would shed light on PSAOs . It seems they have realized the same interesting details from this 2013 General Accounting Office (GAO) study, which indicates that the majority of PSAOs are owned and operated by pharmacy wholesalers or group purchasing organizations (13 of 22). That puts a pharmacy into an interesting situation where one company controls their pro duct supply and purchase cost as well as their reimbursement. It is not difficult to imagine how each piece of that information could be used to benefit the wholesaler to the detriment of the pharmacy.2 Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to answer any questions and provide clarification.
