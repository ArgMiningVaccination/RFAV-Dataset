Words supplied to make sense clear <...> Words or signs omitted by the ancient scribe {...} Superfluous signs ix Abstract This dissertation explores the meanings of pain in ancient Egypt by attending to various ways in which ancient Egyptian texts frame, articulate, problematize, and explain pain . This dissertation takes as its starting point the view that pain is a deeply cultural and historical phenomenon, and that a particular culture's ideas and practices surrounding pain are intimately connected to that culture's understanding of the human pe rson (what man is, what man ought to be, what man's place is in the world, etc.). As the most salient concepts or categories that are used to theorize about the human person in ancient Egypt are maat and the human heart, this study seeks to articulate Egyptian understanding of pain in these terms as well. More specifically, this study argues th at the Egyptian notion of pain -which is far more expansive than English \"pain\" and encompasses the notions of illness, anguish, suffering and evil -can be best conceived of as a rupture in maat , and submits that for the Egyptians, it is the human heart that serves as the locus of the immanent reality of pain. The central argument is fleshed out by the means of a careful reading of the ancient Egyptian tex ts. After compiling the list of relevant vocabulary, I looked into the magico -medical texts, literary narrative texts and non -narrative literary texts. While sharing in broad orientation, these texts frame pain differently. Pain in magico -medical texts is understood as an object of empirical observation and performative action. In the literary narratives, pain serves to foreground the interpersonal relationships and elicits audience empathy. In the non -narrative literary texts, pain is an essential componen t of longing. x Acknowledgements I would like to express my deep gratitude to my dissertation committee \u2014 Professors Jan Johnson, Brian Muhs, and Herv\u00e9 Reculeau \u2014for their help and patience over the course of this project.

Last but not least, I am grateful for Nebeth, my 15 -year-old mi niature schnauzer, who kept me company all along. 1 CHAPTER 1 Introduction: Pain as a Topic of Egyptological Rese arch Pain is a universal part of the human condition. Notwithstanding the enormous advances made in modern medicine to understand and overcome it, pain remains just as inescapable a mystery today as it was in ancient times. In a world where almost everything is explained in scientific and positivist terms, it is tempting to equate pain with a neurophysiological mechanism, and to equate understanding pain with acquiring a precise knowledge of that mechanism. But prima facie , a person is not a machine, and a perso n suffering pain is not a machine with electric signals. Pain simply cannot be abstracted from the person suffering pain.1 One of the key the aspects constitutive of personhood is culture. In recent years, there has been a number of studies that examine the construction of different meanings of pain in different cultures and epochs.2 The current dissertation participates in this trend by focusing on ancient Egypt. More specifically, it investigates different modes of cultural expression in which pain wa s framed, problematized, explained and given meaning in the ancient Egyptian texts. The vast historical and cultural gap between the ancient Egyptian and the twenty -first century societies surely poses a daunting challenge, but it is precisely these challe nges that offer an opportunity to rethink some contemporary assumptions and beliefs regarding pain. This dissertation, therefore, addresses contemporary ways of thinking about pain as much as it seeks to shed light on ancient Egyptian pain. I should also stress that while this dissertation's topic of inquiry for maybe new to 1 In keeping with this principle, the contemporary medical community is increasingly opting for a humanities - oriented approach in updating the heuristic model of pain. According to the current biopsychosocial model, the ways in which individuals experience and respond to pain are formed out of a complex web of interactions among biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. For a widely cited overview of the model, see Gatchel et al. 2007, 581 -624; for an accessible introductory account of the contemporary development of the different m odels of pain, Kugelman 2017. 2 See 1.2 Previous Scholarship below. 2 Egyptological scholarship, the principal ways through which the inquiry is carried out remain firmly grounded in traditional Egyptological methods with a heavy emphasis on philology; I have simply chosen pain as a lens through which to interpret the Egyptian texts. It is my hope that by combining a careful reading of the ancient Egyptian texts with interdisciplinary approaches to pain, this project will contribute to ongoing cultural and historical discourse on pain while adding to the discipline of Egyptology an interesting and thou ghtful exercise. 1.1 Pain: Problems of Language and Definition Before proceeding, it would seem desirable to establish a definition of pain, one that would serve as a reference point for the rest of this dissertation. The problem is that for something seemi ngly straightforward and self -evident, pain is notoriously elusive and difficult to define, and no single definition seems capable of perfectly capturing the \"essence\" or meaning of pain.3 In this section, I would like to examine in brief some conceptual challenges involved in defining pain. The goal here is to step back from the \"obviousness\" of the given category and reflect on fundamental problems that the very topic of pain is known to pose. The most oft -discussed challenge stems from the seemingly pa radoxical nature of pain.4 On the one hand, pain seems to consist of objective conditions, often identifiable with physical damage to our body parts or with the neurophysiological mechanism underlying the sensation of such damage.5 Pain conceived as such is observable and shareable. It can also be objectively measured and quantified, if given the right kinds of procedures and instruments. On the other 3 For instance, Thomas Lewis, a prominent researcher of pain, writes in the preface to his book Pain saying (1942, v): \"I am so far from being able satisfactorily to define pain ... that the attempt could serve no useful purpose.\" Lewis Degenaar, a philosopher, writes ( 1979, 29) : \"I thought I knew what pain was until I was asked to say what the word \"pain\" means.\" 4 Most recent studies cited in this dissertation include a discussion on the p aradoxical nature of pain. For an in -depth philosophical account that specifically deals with the paradox, see Hill 2005; Aydede 2009. 5 For the history of theories of pain mechanisms, see, e.g. Melzack and Wall 2008; Moayedi and Davis 2013. 3 hand, pain is thought to be an immediate and subjective experience. When you feel pain, what you feel is not the tissue being damaged or the C -fibers being fired: you just feel pain. And this pain is anything but observable or shareable. Its existence, intensity, or nature is something that only the person undergoing the experience has an access to , and as such, it resists external assessment or verification. The subjective aspect of pain often gets tied up with the mental (or psychological or emotional) aspect of pain, which further complicates our understanding of pain. It is quite customary to speak of two different kinds of pain -physical and mental -as though there exist two ontologically distinct categories of pain.6 But positing two kinds of pain invites an array of questions associated with the perennial dilemma of mind -body duali sm: If physical pain refers to the body being in pain, what is \"being in pain\" in the case of mental pain? Or, if physical pain refers to the body causing the pain, what causes mental pain? If the answer is \"the mind,\" what is mind? If mind is that which i s not the body, then how can something that is not the body be in pain or cause the body to be in pain? If mind is just another name for neurophysiological processes, then how is mental pain any different from physical pain, which, too, can be explained in terms of neurophysiological processes?7 This is not the place to discuss dualism at length.8 For our purposes, it suffices to say that however \"natural\" it may seem to think of pain in dualistic terms, scholars suggest that, to a great extent, doing so is an acquired habit that arises from a 6 Cf. Morris (1991, 9ff) who refers to the phenomenon as the \"Myth of Two Pains.\" 7 Hence the amusing joke cited in Bourke 2014, 10: \"What happens when a neurologist has a stomachache? He makes an appointment with a gastroenterol ogist who asks him, 'where does it hurt?' The neurologist replies, 'In my head, of course!'\" 8 Broadly speaking, there are two different types of dualism. The kind associated with Descartes is called substance dualism, according to which mind and body are composed of two fundamentally different kinds of substances. The second kind is called property dualism: mind and body represent two different kinds of properties of a single substance. In addition to these two, there are many other varieties of \" -ism\" tha t have spawned based on different interpretations of the manner by which the interaction between mind and body is thought to take place. For an overview with bibliography, see Robinson 2020. 4 historically contingent development in the relatively recent past. Often, the root of this conception of pain is traced back to the 17th century, to Descartes's proposition that mind and body are independent entities with distinctive functions. A feature of this dualistic outlook is that the body works like a machine, and from this resulted the famous mechanical model of pain.9 This model gained wide acceptance as modern scientific medicine started to take shape in t he subsequent centuries, and eventually came to influence the popular conception of pain today.10 Another conceptual issue surrounding pain involves the problem of language. An article in the journal Pain reads, \"Pain...is difficult to convey to others, and relies significantly on language to be communicated. The language used to describe pain is therefore an important aspect of understanding and assessing another's pain.\"11 In a clinical context, this view is common, for obvious reasons: How can a physician know about the pain a patient is experiencing, other than through the patient's own description? Outside of a clinical context, however, the exact role of language in relation to pain has been subject to extensive critical discussion . Some see pain as so utterly private that any attempt to express pain accurately using language, which is inherently social, is simply not possible.12 For others, pain is not only expressible, but also capable of expanding the pre -existing language repertoire.13 Still others 9 Morris 1991, 72 -77; Boddice 2017, 27; Kugelman 2017, Scholars often cite from Descartes' Treatise of Man (1662) the diagram of a kneeling man with a nerve pathway stretching from his foot to his brain. The actual account that Descartes proposed was, however, a little more nuanced than modern schola rs often make it out to be. Duncan 2000 . For a short history of development of pain concepts since the 17th century, Zimmermann 2006, 1 -19. 10 One could say that the contemporary efforts towards a more unified or holistic conceptualization of pain by humanities -oriented medicine are meant to \"emancipate\" the medicine from undue influence of Cartesian principles. For instance, the main reason the IASP definition is more widely accepted than others (see below) is the inclusion of emotion as integral to t he pain experience, which has been perceived as a long -awaited departure from the dualistic approach to pain. 11 Strong et al. 2009, 86. 12 This view is most famously associated Scarry 1985, which I review below. 13 See, for instance, Bending 1997; Bacchini 2012. 5 would say that a person cannot make sense of her own pain if not for the cognitive structure laid down by language.14 Today, the most oft -cited definition of pain is the one offered by The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). It defines pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.\"15 The definition takes into account the conceptual challenges discussed above and attempts at capturing both the folk and clinical/scientific usage of the term \"pain.\"16 Having been formulated by the world's experts and adopted by official organizations suc h as the World Health Organization (WHO), the IASP definition certainly carries a high degree of authoritativeness. It is however interesting to observe that in 2020, some revisions were made to its original 1979 formulation.17 The revisions were prompted by the advances in understanding of pain made by the scientific and clinical communities over the last forty years, the IASP explains .18 This attests to the historical contingency of the modern discourse of pain. The updated IASP definition may qualify as a \"universal\" characterization of the human experience of pain today, but within another 40 years (or even less), it may require another revision so as to keep up with advances in science and changing needs of the concerned community. Quite naturally, ther e arises a question regarding the relevance and applicability of a definition of pain 14 This view is associated with Wittgenstein's famous argument against private language ( Philosophical Investigations \u00a7\u00a7243 -315), which has been adopted in a few humanities pain studies, such as in Bourke 2014 and Ablow 2017. 15 Raja et al. 2020. 16 Aydede 2019. 17 The original 1979 formulation defined pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated wi th actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.\" Merskey et al. 1979. On the background and history of the IASP definition of pain, Cohen et al. 2018. The word \"described\" in the phrase \"or described in terms of such damage\" in t he original definition implied that verbal communication was required for pain to exist. The new definition's wording does not require any verbal description. In addition to the change in wording of the definition, revisions have been made to the Notes acc ompanying the definition. Finally, the etymology of the word \"pain\" has been added, \"to raise awareness among readers of its transactional, punitive meaning in contrast to other archaic words that emphasized the location of pain or its negative effect upon mood.\" Raja et al. 2020. 18 Raja et al. 2020. 6 such as the one by IASP for the purpose of this study. What may be sufficient in the contemporary clinical context of pain assessment and management, may not be sufficien t to be used as a reference point or framework for studying pain at a broader cultural level in a distant society such as ancient Egypt, from which we are separated by a few millennia. Finally, i t is also worth noting that any definition of \"pain\" is inev itably shot through the prism of modern English. Some crucial considerations in this regard are the cross -linguistic and cross -cultural variations in encoding the word for pain.19 Not all languages have words exactly corresponding to \"pain.\"20 Adopting a d efinition of pain centered on the English term \"pain\" may appear commonsensical because of English's status as the lingua franca in contemporary scientific and academic discourses . Nevertheless, given the particular etymology and semantic scope of \"pain,\" it seems rather problematic to use it as a reference point for all pain.21 19 On this issue, see Fabrega and Tyma 1976; Diller 1980; Wierzbicka 2012; Kim et al. 2016. 20 For instance, a common word for pain in Korean is kotong , which is formed from Sino -Korean \"bitter,\" \"distressed\") and tong ( \"pain,\" \" sorrow ,\" \"torment,\" and \"hardship\" among others. Another common word for pain is apeuda which can mean \"to feel/be pain\" as well as \"to be ill.\" I should stress that it is not the case these words have several different meanings, for instance, for kotong , one corresponding to \"pain\", another \"agony,\" another \"hardship,\" etc. Rather, \"pain\" is one of the many instances that kotong could be used to translate, and non -\"pain\" instances far outweigh \"pain\" instances, with the result that when an ordinary native speaker of Korean hears the word kotong , what she thinks of is not identical to what an ordinary native English speaker would think of upon hearing the word \"pain.\" Hence, while both kotong and apeuda can mean \"pain,\" it is difficult to see \"pain\" as their primary meaning. Cf. Goddard and Wierzbicka (2014, 127) aruge that \"different ways of thinking about pain, linked with different languages and cultures, colour the way people of different linguistic and cultural backgrounds and express their pain.\" 21 According to OED, the English word \"pain\" derives from Anglo -French peine , from from Greek poin meaning \"payment,\" or \"penalty.\" While the original meaning has weakened over the centuries, the word still retains the connotation of punishment , as in \"on pain of death.\" The problem of taking the English word \"pain\" as the point of reference is addressed by Anna Wierzbicka, a prominent linguist known for her theories of semantics. According to her ( 2012, 316) : The English word pain is not one o f those which \"cut nature at its joints.\" Its meaning is a conceptual construct, perhaps not uniquely English, but not truly universal either. It is natural, and reasonable, for English -speaking students of what they think of as \"pain\" to continue thinking about the phenomena in question as \"pain,\" and to continue using the English word pain as a convenient shorthand. When it comes, however, to identifying the universal aspect of the human condition which Anglophone psychology and medicine associate with th e word pain, it is also desirable to try to understand it \u2014at some point \u2014from a universal human perspective. And it is important to note that from such a perspective we can't even say that \"different languages reflect different conceptualizations of pain\" \u2014as if \"pain\" were a preexisting ontological category independent of the English language. 7 In view of these problems, I would like to proceed by acknowledging that what we mean by pain is a conglomeration of m any different experiences and situations that go far beyond what any single definition can adequately capture.22 At the same time, I would like to draw attention to the fact that however heterogeneous conceptualizations of pain may be from culture to cultu re, or even among individuals within the same culture, people still manage to talk about pain. What is that which makes communication of pain possible? At this point, it will be worthwhile to review the existing research on the cultural history of pain, wh ich will help establish the basic contours of the subsequent analysis and discussion. 1.2 Prior Scholarship : Cultural History of Pain Elaine Scarry's The Body in Pain (1985) is considered to be the definitive work which influenced all the subsequent literary and cultural studies on pain.23 Scarry takes the problem of representation as her central problematic. According to Scarry, pain \"resists objectification in langua ge,\" 24 because there is simply no \"object\" of reference in the world corresponding to pain: all there is the body that feels pain. She continues: 22 In this respect, I follow the view of Fabrega and Tyma (1976) who suggested that pain need not be defined too rigorously in a linguistic or cultural approach to pain . Cf. Wittgenstein's notion of family, which resemblance can provide a helpful model of understanding here. Wittgenstein draws attention to how one and the same concept can be applied to a variety of situations not because these situations share a set of n ecessary and sufficient properties but because they share \"a complicated network of similarities overlapping and crisscrossing similarities in the large and in the small.\" Philosophical Investigations \u00a766. He refers to these similarities as \"family resembl ances.\" We can think of different kinds of pain as sharing family resemblances. 23 Scarry 1985. On the influences of Scarry's work on modern scholarship on pain, see van Ommen, Cromby & Yen 2016. 24 Scarry 1985, 5. In addition, Scarry argues that this pre-linguistic state is universal in nature, and such a view has rightly been criticized by many for underplaying the sociocultural and historical specificity of pain. At times, Scarry acknowledges the role of culture in construction of pain, but ultimatel y, she argues that such \"cultural differences, taken collectively, would themselves constitute only a very narrow margin of variation and would thus in the end work to expose and confirm the universal sameness of the central problem.\" Ibid., 5. For critici sms of Scarry on the ground of her universalizing rhetoric, see Bourke 2011. Norridge (2013, 9) specifically points out that linguistic and cultural biases are inherent in Scarry's selection of sources. In addition to her universalizing account of pain, Scarry's work has been criticized for, among others, \"a blithe disregard for the ordinary canons of argument\" and academicism more outr\u00e9 2001. According to Norridge (2013 , 7), Scarry wrote the book out of an intellectual climate heavily influenced by poststructuralist psychoanalysis and 8 Physical pain does not simply resist language but actively destroys it, bringing about an immediate reversion to a state anterior to language, to the sounds and cries a human being makes before language is learned.25 That pain resists linguistic representation means that pain cannot be adequately expressed or communicated among people. In the second half of the book, however, Scarry proceeds to show how this otherwise unrepresentable pain gets represented in the realm of literature and art, owing to the faculty of human imagination: \"While pain is a state remarkable for being wholly without objects, the imaginati on is remarkable for being the only state that is wholly its objects.\"26 In other words, the imagination makes it possible to represent pain by supplying it with the missing object. While her arguments have not always been met without resistance, her work has been of central significance in pain scholarship as it raises questions about the constitutive relationships between subjectivity, language and the body. David Morris' The Culture of Pain (1991), is another key literary theoretical work on pain.27 Morr is' central premise is that the modern scientific worldview has robbed pain of its rich meanings. He is highly critical of the medical approach to pain that reduces pain to tissue damage or nerve impulses. He argues that this approach, grounded in the mech anistic ontology of the human body, is inadequate to deal with pain because pain is not only physiological but also psychological, social, and cultural. Throughout the work, Morris strives to demythologize the widespread cultural assumptions about pain and to recover pain's lost meanings. He notes that, in many ancient societies, doctors were also priests, because treating pain required mediating between the physical and spiritual worlds. In other words, ancient doctor -priests not deconstruction, as well as the post second world war sentiment epitomized in Adorno's dictum, \"to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.\" 25 Scarry 1985, 4. 26 Scarry 1985, 1 62. 27 The same author also discusses at length the literary approach to the topic of suffering. See Morris 1996. 9 only treated pain by inter preting different omens and signs, they provided an explanation for pain. This is an interesting remark that is worth examining more in depth.28 The book explores a wide array of representations of pain in the western literary canon, from Homer and Virgil through Dante and Shakespeare to Joyce and Beckett, to name just a few. In the final chapter, \"Future of Pain,\" the readers are exhorted to dispose of the mechanistic understanding of pain and to learn to think for themselves about pain. In The History of Pain (1995), the French historian Roselyne Rey takes a long view and presents evolving medical accounts of pain from classical antiquity to the 1950s. Unlike Morris, who is very critical of the dualistic account of pain, Rey sees it as inevitabl e and asks, \"Isn't an in-depth analysis of pain also a means of probing the relationship between mind and body, and of examining the dualism that somehow underlies our various ways of thinking?\"29 For Rey, pain is, first and foremost, based on an anatomica l and physiological foundation, and it is the advances in medical and scientific understanding of pain mechanisms that serve as the reference point for writing the history of pain. The importance of individual, social and cultural characteristics of pain i s not entirely dismissed, but they are treated as background information. As the focus is laid on the biomedical, rather than the philosophical -religious, the history of the Middle Ages, during which no significant scientific discovery was thought to be ma de, is not dealt with in depth, while nearly one -third of the book is devoted to the 19th century. Lucy Bending's The Representation of Bodily Pain in Late Nineteenth -Century English Culture (1997) explores the cultural constructedness of pain specific to the late Victorian era.30 She is among the first scholars to raise explicit objections against Scarry's claim that pain utterly 28 I will discuss the Egyptain example in Chpater 3. 29 Rey 1995, 2. 30 Albow 2017 is another work on pain during the Victorian era. 10 resists language on the grounds of \"a range of representational tactics\" employed by the writers.31 The first two chapters pres ent the Christian and medical understandings of pain and examine the ways in which the tension between these two dominant discourses shaped the late Victorian understanding of bodily pain. In chapter 3, the relationship of pain to language is discussed, an d Scarry's thesis of the inexpressibility of pain is denounced as unsound. The rest of the book is devoted to the analysis of the rhetorical strategies of Victorian writers such as Robert Louis Stevenson and Oscar Wilde, who creatively exploited the litera ry and social conventions of their time and turned pain into a shared experience. Esther Cohen's The Modulated Scream (2010) is a pioneering work on medieval scholarship about pain. Cohen holds that though the immediate quality of pain can never be known to anyone other than the person in pain, it is also a social construction that is shared, discussed and transmitted in a variety of forms.32 She turns to scholastic, legal, medical and biographical texts in order to tease out late medieval Christian Europe an attitudes towards pain. The central observation she makes is that despite the differences in the vocabulary of pain among different professional discourses, there was an overall coherence centered on the teleological view of pain, that pain is a salvific instrument of God. Accordingly, pain was accepted as a given reality and even valorized for moral, legal, or social purposes.33 Pain: A Cultural History (2012) by historian Javier Moscoso covers the period of 500 years from the Renaissance to the present. The focus is laid on pain as a cultural and historical phenomenon, but the author explicitly distances himself from other historians with a disclaimer 31 Bending 1 997, 83, 86 -9, 32 Cohen 2010, 3. 33 According to the author, the general acceptance of pain went hand in hand with the physicians' efforts for pain management and alleviation. The popular perception of \"the medieval man\" who ignored or deliberately exacerbat ed pain for pain's sake, according to the author, is \"the brainchild of historians...\" and results from \"a tendentious selection of evidence.\" Ibid., 90 -91. 11 that his book is more \"a book on the historical epistemology of (a certain type) of experience, on the rhetoric and persuasive means historically employed to generate conviction about the reality of pain.\"34 In other wo rds, the author is more interested in unraveling the mechanisms by which the raw data of pain are transformed into something publicly recognizable and meaningful than producing \"a mere accumulation of cases\" of what a certain people of a certain culture in this or that period felt or thought about pain. Significantly, Moscoso describes the object of his study as a \"social drama\": ... its historical variations share some common elements; it implies recognizing that, independently of its cultural expressions, there is a constant traveling down the path of suffering and facing harmful experience. Pain's drama appears in a sequential form; it displays a dynamic structure that includes a moment of rupture that demands reparation.35 The book is organ ized according to 8 topoi\u2014representation, imitation, sympathy, correspondence, trust, normativit y, coherence and reiterations \u2014which also correspond to the titles of each chapter. It is not always clear how the content of the chapters \u2014the objects and their analy ses\u2014is connected to the titles. Overall, the ways in which the author interweaves the analyses of the particular objects (paintings, plays, scientific discoveries, etc.) with the broader historical developments and issues allows him to present different meanings of pain as a cultural and social phenomenon. The Story of Pain by Joanna Bourke (2014) is another history of pain that emphasizes the socially and historically determined experience of pain. The author demonstrates the historica l shifts from the 18th century to the present day in the ways people in the English -speaking world communicate and experience pain by drawing on a wide range of sources from poems and letters to medical journals and archival records. Similar themes explore d in Scarry are taken up again, 34 Moscoso 2012, 2. 35 Moscoso 2012, 6. 12 but from a manifestly different philosophical perspective. According to Bourke, Scarry commits \"an ontological fallacy\" when she treats the metaphoric ways of conceiving pain as descriptions of an independent entity and give s agency to this reified pain rather than to the person in pain. Such an approach can easily become solipsistic and therefore is unfit for doing the proper history of pain which takes place in the social milieu, she argues. Bourke opts for a more intersubj ective approach. Drawing on Wittgenstein, she regards pain as neither fully subjective nor private as it is always mediated by the conceptual structure of language, in addition to social and environmental interactions and bodily comportment. She suggests t hat pain should be viewed a \"type of event\" instead of as a feeling, or sensation itself; pain functions more like an adverb than a noun in that it describes \"the way we experience something, not what is experienced.\"36 When it comes to the history of pai n as it relates to the classical period, there have been a number of studies discussing aspects of pain in relation to medicine, poetry, drama and philosophy.37 Experiencing Pain in Imperial Greek Culture (2018) by Daniel King is a recent publication that is specifically devoted to the study of pain in antiquity. He notes that thus far, the study of pain in antiquity has only been approached from either the perspective that privileges the scientific unders tanding of pain or from the perspective that emphasizes the cultural meaning. King's aim is to reconcile these two perspectives by attending to \"embodied pain experience.\"38 He begins his discussion with the analysis of the medical treatises and identifies the model of physiological pain extant in medical diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of patients in pain. Medical practitioners during the Imperial period possessed extensive 36 Bourke 2014, 7. 37 For pain in ancient medicine, especially Hippocratic material, King 1988 and Horden 2008. For Homer, Holmes 2007. For other Archaic poetry, Allen 2009. For tragedy, Budelmann 2007. In relation to emotions, Konstan 2006 and 2018. 38 Describing an experienc e as \"embodied\" (or \"lived\") has become quite common in scholarly parlance across different discplines these days, including Egyptology. Cf. Excursus A at the end of Chapter 2. 13 anatomical understanding of the body and were very proficient in communicating this. He then expands on this by drawing on the emotional and social implications of pain from various philosophical, novelistic, and rhetorical texts. Writers like Plutarch and Lucian, the author observes, contributed to expanding the medical conception o f pain into broader terms including hardship and trial by drawing on different literary and generic traditions. The author also explores the ways the Imperial writers helped construct different kinds of \"gazes\" toward the pained body and the different kind s of responses they elicited from the viewer. Synthesizing his analysis, King argues that embodied pain experience during the Imperial period was underpinned by the emergence of a particular understanding of the physical body (what he terms the anatomico -aesthetic model of the body), which in turn was closely connected to the alleged degeneracy and cultural decline of classical antiquity. Another work in the field of Classics is the edited volume titled Pain and Pleasure in Classical Times (2018). David Ko nstan's \"On Grief and Pain\" explores the concept of grief (lup\u00ea, which also designated physical pain) as treated by Aristotle. According to Konstan, Aristotle did not include lup\u00ea under the label path\u00f4s (emotion) because Aristotle considered lup\u00ea as more e lementary than other emotions (anger, pity, shame, etc.). For Aristotle, for something to count as emotions, it has to involve moral evaluations of human behavior. Grief, however, is aroused and is shared by irrational animals. In Egyptology, there is not much work dedicated to the topic of pain. In this respect, the paper \"Everybody Hurts: Understanding and Visualizing Pain in Ancient Egypt\" by Tara Prakash is a welcome contribution.39 She starts by providing a brief overview of modern trends in pain rese arch. She notes that the emotional aspect of pain and cultural specificity of pain are 39 Prakash 2021, 103 -125. 14 among the topics that scholars have become increasingly interested in and presents her own investigation of the Egyptian visualization of pain as contributing to this br oader ongoing discourse on pain. Prakash examines three types of depictions of pain from the Old Kingdom tombs: spanking scenes, scenes of landowners or herdsman being forced to pay taxes and mourning scenes. According to her, pain is visualized in these s cenes with specific contextual cues, such as connections among figures, poses, activities and captions. Subtler cues are also employed such as physical contact, overlapping bodies, and raised arms about to strike. Prakash notes that the Egyptians frequentl y visualized other emotions with contextual cues as well. She then suggests that the boundary between physical pain and emotional suffering was fluid, and that the Egyptians viewed physical pain and emotional suffering to be related and perhaps correspondi ng phenomena. In order to lend further weight to her argument, she also considers the semantic scope and usage of the Egyptian word mr. She cites a few passages from different texts where mr seems to be indicating something other than physical illness or i njuries.40 She also adduces the results of other lexical studies on mr.41 1.3. Meanings of Pain beyond the Definition of Pain The time periods and cultures covered in the works reviewed above are vast and varied. Yet, there are several points of convergence. First, they emphasize how pain tends to obscure the traditional border between mind and body, objective and subjective, or culture and nature , a 40 Specifically, she cites two spells from the Pyramid Text, a passage from the Eloquent Peasant , and another passage from the Man's discourse with his Ba . 41 Unfortunately, the sources she cites are not publicly available. Marie -Lys Arnette, \"Des mots pour d'arch\u00e9ologie orientale, November 2017) and Marie - Lys Arnette, \"Douleur et emotion: des mots pour des maux, suite des investigations\" (lecture, Universit\u00e9 Paris -Sorbonne, Paris, France, September 8, 2018). 15 point already made in 1.1.42 There seems to exist a consensus among these scholars that the biomedical paradigm falls short in its ability to explain or provide an adequate framework for understanding pain ; as important as genetic factors and physiology are, these do not fully determine the way people exper ience and respond to pain. Secondly, and more significantly , the works reviewed above all draw attent ion to how, before the scientific worldview of biomedicine became the dominant paradigm, fields such as religion, philosophy, art and literature played an important role in enabling people to make different meanings out of pain. Examination of the representations and discourses of pain in these areas reveals that meanings imbued to pain are closely related to a society's worldview, especially to an understa nding of human nature, i.e., what a human being is and ought to be. In what follows, I would like to provide a brief sketch of some of the well -known instances that offer glimpses into different dimensions of pain's meaning . While not exhaustive, these accounts shall be sufficient to demonstrate that pain can accrue special meanings outside the realm of medicine One aspect that is frequently left out of contemporary discourse on pain but has been central to the conceptualization of pain across many different cultures through the ages, is the question of how pain affects people's ability to attribute mean ing to their lives. This question stems from the common human desire to structure our lives not just around quotidian events, but also around something bigger: a certain purpose, a happy and meaningful life. Faced with pain, people's day -to-day life is di srupted, and the prospect of lasting happiness seems unattainable. People then often ask: Why me? Why now? What is the meaning of all this? When satisfactory answers are not available, even greater distress and pain can result. Attempts to transcend or 42 In addition to the works reviewed above, refer to the interdisplinary collection of essays contained in Coakley and Shelemay 2007. 16 reconcile with the apparent meaninglessness of pain frequently find expression in philosophical and religious discourses. For instance, in Christianity, there exists an understanding that Christ redeemed the world through his pain. Simply acknowledging this c omprises a form of divine knowledge, since one is accepting as true what has been revealed by God himself (as Christ is traditionally believed to be God incarnate). Even more divine is to imitate this God incarnate, that is, to participate in the redemptio n by suffering pain. For those who accept this account, e.g., the martyrs and saints, pain presents an opportunity and means to become God -like. Pain is also central to the path to knowledge in Buddhist tradition. The Four Noble Truths, which comprise the foundation of Buddhist philosophy, are organized around the very notion of pain.43 Pain is the true nature of all existence. Birth, aging, illness, and death are all pain, and by coming to see and acknowledge this, one takes the very step (the first noble truth) towards the ultimate knowledge, which is liberation from pain. In this view, the more you are familiar with pain, the better, since it gives you greater desire and motivation for embarking on the path. Pain can also figure prominently in moral disco urse, as something intimately related to the notions of empathy or compassion that are essential for inculcating moral virtues and promoting social harmony. While in Western moral discourse, it is only in the last century or so that empathy as a concept ha s started gaining currency,44 a moral tradition in the Far East has long accorded central importance to one's receptivity or responsiveness to others' pain. T he virtue of ren ( \"humaneness\", \"benevolence\" ) in Confucian moral thought forms the 43 Translators have pointed out the Pali word dukkha (Sanskrit: dukha ) does not adequately translate into either \"pain\" nor \"suffering.\" This may be true, but it also seems to be the case that over time, a word can gain different meanings owing to the tran slated usage. For instance, the same word kotong in Korean is used both for the Latin word dolor in the Catholic usage and for the Buddhist dukkha . 44 There has been some substantial discussion and research in recent times on the empathy concept (which often includes the distinction between empathy, sympathy, pity, compassion, etc). For a broad yet balanced survey that discusses both historical and phil osophical aspects of the empathy concept, see Stueber 2019. 17 foundation for individual moral excellence as well as for the proper governance of the state and family. According to Mencius, a Confucian sage as revered as Confucius himself, ren begins from the commiserating heart, i.e., the heart that cannot bear to se e the suffering of another, or which is susceptible to be pained by another's pain .45 As ren is not an abstract principle, but something that underlies concrete moral actions in the interpersonal realm, connecting individual to individual, and individual t o society,46 it is not surprising that ren's root should be explicated in immanent and experiential terms that foreground the affective dimension of pain. That one can be pained by other's pain is a first tangible proof that human nature is capable of undoing the barriers between the self and the other. When people cultivate and effectively embody ren, they understand how to act \u2014and in fact do act in all circumstances \u2014in a way that diminishes pain and promotes well -being. With valorization of a virtue such as ren, then, pain can take on an immensel y moral and collective dimension of meaning. Pain is also frequently linked with the notion of beauty. For instance, in the classical Greco -Roman tradition, as attested in both literature (e.g., Sophocles' Philoctetes ) and in visual arts (e.g., the statue of Laoco\u00f6n), the display of excruciating pain is thought to arouse a sense of aesthetic pleasure in the audience. For the German Romantics, tragedy represented the sublime, the apex of human creativity. There is also a tradition that has valorized the link between pain and beauty from the opposite direction. Something beautiful, such as the spectacle of falling of cherry blossoms, is thought to evoke a very subtle kind of pain. 45 The famous example used to illustrate the point reads: \"if anyone sees a child about to fall into a well, he will immediately feel alarmed and distressed. He feels thus, not because he intends to gain the favor of the child's parents, to gain the praise of his neighbors and friends, or because he cannot stand the sound of the child's cries.\" (1 Gongsun Chou 6), cited in and translated from Lee 2004, 62. 46 According to the standard interpretation , the character for ren () represents a combination of the characters for person () and two ( ), embodying its inherently interpersonal dimension. 18 In each of these cases, pain is not treated as an independent object or phenom enon to be scrutinized in itself but as a reality woven into the very fabric of human existence. What is more, pain is not perceived as something entirely negative, but as a window to achieving more meaningful lives . Be it religious knowledge, moral virtue or aesthetic sensibility , these discourses share in common a fundamental orientation towards what is good and worth pursuing. It is this shared understanding of substantive values, i.e., beliefs and practices that people a re motivated to promote and preserve, that pain becomes representable and imbued with more durable and collective meanings. To inquire into pain in these discourses is therefore to inquire of the vision each discourse takes to be ultimate reality and human ity's relation to it. One of the fundamental objectives of this dissertation shall be articulating the meanings of pain in relation to enduring Egyptian values. 1.4 Methodological Approaches I have thus far introduced pain as the topic of research in ver y broad terms and sketched out the perspective taken in the dissertation. The remainder of this introductory chapter is devoted to explicating the methodological framework informing the contextualizing strategies pursued in this dissertation. While this di ssertation is informed by other works of cultural histories of pain in its theoretical orientation, it adopts a different methodological approach in order to execute its professed objective. This is because ancient Egyptian sources are far patchier compared to modern, medieval or even classical records, and also, without a continuing tradition of transmission and reception from antiquity to modern era, the cultural milieu in which ancient Egyptian texts are written is not as readily accessible.47 Overall, I suggest a rigorous way of 47 Cf. Baines 2021b: \"[e]ven the vast record from Deir el -Medina is far more fragmentary and difficult to order than the Inquisition report underlying Montaillou.\" 19 reading the texts, which proceeds from lexical -level analysis to philological and literary analysis, then to a discussion of textual genres and higher -level context analysis. In this way, I demonstrate how the significance of pain does not depend solely on particular words, phrases or formula, but rather emerges from the varying levels of context. I draw on insights from such various fields as semiotics, linguistics, anthropology and various strands of literary theory. As i t is very frequent in the field of Egyptology to import a concept without much theoretical reflection, which results in quick reification and mutation of the concept that becomes incomprehensible to those outside Egyptology, I take some time to explicate t he concepts and theories, even at the expense of drawing attention away from the immediate topic of pain. Where possible, I try to connect them with pre -existing terminology and concepts already current in the Egyptological scholarship. The chapter closes with outlines of the remaining chapters of the dissertation. 1.4.1 Lexicography and Linguistics The obvious first step consists of compiling a list of pain -related words and providing the description of their meanings. The identification of the meanings of words for dead languages is not a straightforward process in general, and it is especially so with words relating to pain. In so far as lexicography is concerned, I rely on existing compilations of reference works and translations. All the major dictio naries and lexicons are consulted,48 and the meanings are cross - referenced with each other and checked against the known attestations in the primary sources. 1.4.2 Philology and Poetics 48 For the list of the dictionaries and lexicons consulted, see 2.1.1. 20 The vast bulk of my dissertation is devoted to analyzing and interpreting the key passages that feature pain, selected from different \"genres\" of texts.49 Instead of a comprehensive catalogue of terms, I focus on a selection of passages that shed light on the range of dynamic ways pain figures in the texts and organ izes the discourse. For each passage, I provide philological analysis , which consists of transliteration, translation and grammatical notes. This is followed by a detailed analysis of various literary devices such as repetition, parallelism, framing storie s and emplotment. The analysis of literary forms can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of Egyptian conceptualization of pain. Consider the following example of parallelism from Sinuhe (B 131 -135): a ty nb yw r b nb mr.(w) n dsn d n w wn ky n t rf every heart burning for me, women and men wailing; every mind being in pain for me, saying: is there another strongman who can fight for him? The lines a and c convey a similar idea but in two different ways. Based on the fact that ty and b are similar in meaning,50 and that nb and n are repeated, it can reasonably be expected that their predicates, m.(w) and mr.(w) , would share some me aning in common. From this, one may conclude the experience of pain for the Egyptians had some affinity to the experience of fire. While this is one of the ways literary analysis can shed light on Egyptian understanding of pain, what I am more interested i n is the ways in which these verbal forms can activate the aesthetic experience of pain, which I shall henceforth refer to as the poetics of pain. 49 See below 1.4.3 for the discussion on genres. 50 The distinction between b and ty is more pronounced in medica l texts. See Walker 1996, 147 -186. For the idioms and metaphors concerning heart, see Toro Rueda 2003. 21 The term poetics may require some explication. It is widely used across the fields of cultural and literary studies, and in its most expansive usage, it refers to the patterns of a cluster of literary forms centered on a theme: the poetics of pain, the poetics of war, the poetics of exile, etc. In its more restricted meaning, poetics refers to the study of liter ary forms or theory of literature, whose central question can be summed up as, \"W hat makes a work of art a work of art?\" While a concern with poetics in the Western literary tradition traces back to Aristotle's Poetics , the point of departure for this diss ertation is the poetic function formulated by Roman Jakobson, a linguist of the Prague School and central figure in Russian Formalism. In his seminal paper, \"Concluding Statement: Linguistics and Poetics,\" Jakobson outlines six language factors and the cor responding six language functions that constitute any act of verbal communication.51 Posited as one of these six functions, the poetic function focuses on the message factor, i.e., the linguistic form, rather than the referent or the content.52 Jakobson th en provides a structural definition of the mechanism by which the poetic function accomplishes what it accomplishes: \"the poetic function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination.\"53 This formulation is of great theoretical import and is worth unpacking. The basic concept underlying this formulation is the distinction between two types of relations that exist between signs \u2014syntagmatic and paradigmatic \u2014as conceived by structural linguistics. The signs along the axis of selection are said to be in paradigmatic or equivalent relations to one another, in that they can all potentially occupy the same slot in a sequence; the signs form a group in absentia . along the axis of combination are in syntagmatic or contiguous 51 Jakobson 1960, 350 -377. 52 The oft -cited definition reads, \"the set ( Einstellung ) toward the message as such, focus on the message for its own sake.\" Jakobson 1960, 356. In another classical article of his, \"What is Poetry?\" Jakobson writes: \"poeticity is present when the word is felt as a word and not as a mere representation of the object being named or an outburst of emotion: when words and th eir composition, their meaning, their external and internal form acquire a weight and value of their own instead of referring indifferently to reality.\" Jakobson 1987 [1933], 378. 53 Jakobson 1960, 358. 22 relations in that they are com bined for a sequence; it is a relation in praesentia . For instance, in the sentence \"a big cat is on a rug,\" the word \"big\" has been selected among the words such as \"large,\" \"fat\" or \"small,\" etc., with which it fo rms a paradigmatic set, and is combined with words like \"a,\" \"cat,\" \"is,\" \"rug,\" etc., to yield an intelligible sequence of meaning. In ordinary speech, where the other functions of language (referential function, in particular) are dominant, the two axes are kept distinct. In the above sentence, the way \"big\" or \"rug\" has been selected from their respective paradigmatic sets is indifferent to their relation to \"cat\" as long as the formed sentence is grammatical and (frequently, though not necessarily) accu rately refers to the extra -linguistic fact of there really being a big cat on a mat. In contrast, in an utterance where the poetic function is dominant, the axes collide. In the sentence \"a fat cat sat on a mat\", the words \"fat,\" \"sat\" and \"mat,\" are selec ted in a way that echoes the sound of \"cat,\" which means, these signs, in addition to forming a syntagm, also form a paradigm with the phonetic element /\u00e6t/ in common. Put differently, there is equivalence among the elements forming the sentence, and Jakob son saw this kind of projected equivalence as the fundamental principle underlying any poetic or literary utterances. The perceived beauty of an utterance is an effect of this equivalence. 54 Beautifulness, however, is only one of the effects of poetics, a nd in subsequent chapters I will frequently talk about other effects that may arise.55 There are many different kinds of similarity relations that can be exploited to construct a sequence at different levels. In the above example, similarity is expressed in the consecutive repetition of the same phonemes for a short sequence of one sentence. It could also be created through an arrangement in patterns of syllable stress that can be repeated over a sequence of 54 Building upon Jakobson's framework, some scholars ar e now exploring the psychological and neural mechanism underlying the aesthetic appreciation, with the help of technological advances in neuroscience. Tsur 2008. 55 For a more thorough theoretical explication and significance of Jakobson's poetic function, see among others, Maslov 2018. 23 fourteen lines to construct a sonnet. Or, it could be any kind of parallelism or repetition set into larger thematic structures.56 By far the most common instance of manifestation of poetic function in Egyptian texts is the kind exemplified by the Sinuhe passage above, where ab and cd not only comprise a sequence but also\u2014as indicated by their synta ctic parallelism and semantic parallelism \u2014a set.57 The reason we can infer the meaning of m, a hapax, is precisely because of the device of parallelism. Observing the equivalence between m and mr is, of course, important. But it is also important to recognize the rhythm of these words. Repetition of units of similar length with similar syntact ic patterns sets up a bodily rhythm of a sort ,58 which, when mapped onto a chain of ideas, establishes a corresponding rhythm in thought. In my view, this rhythm, too, contributes to the meaning of pain in this passage. To focus only on the semantic equiva lence between m and mr at a lexical level is to sever pain from its poetics, and in the subsequent chapters, I will be particularly attentive to analyses that reach beyond the level of lexemes and semantics. Poetic function is also at play in the orderi ng of narratives, i.e., in plot construction. Taking Genette's succinct definition of a narrative as \"the representation of an event or of a sequence of events,\"59 these events can be sequenced so as to echo one another, as in a ring composition where the events are arranged chiastically (ABBA, ABCB'A', etc.). In Egyptian literary works, the poetic function is also frequently manifest in different layers of embeddin g or 56 Jakobson & Pomorska 1983 [1980], 107: \"the parallelism of units connected by similarity, contrast, or contiguity actively influences the composition of the plot, the characterization of the subjects and objects of the acti on, and the sequence of themes in the narrative.\" Cf. Chatman 1978, 127 where character is taken as a paradigm, \"the set of traits, metaphorically, as a vertical assemblage intersecting the syntagmatic chain of events that comprise the plot.\" 57 Egyptologis ts use the term \"thought couplet\" (Foster 1975) to refer to parallelism. A thought couplet consists of two lines, in which the second line complements, expands on, or contrasts with the first. 58 Whether there can be a rhythm in the absence of a meter is d ebated. Dobbs -Allsopp makes a convincing case for Hebrew poetry that poetic rhythm can be present without meter. 2015, 99ff. 59 Genette 1982, 127. Though influential, this definition is not by any means unanimous. For different definitions of narratives wit h bibliography, see Ryan 2007, 22 -35. 24 framing. We can think of different levels of frame stories or the presence of multiple registers or genres as constitutive of a sequence in which the principle of equivalence is at work. To use Sinuhe as an example, within the overarching autobiograph ic frame, different genres of texts are concatenated, and they form a sequence that runs parallel to the ongoing plot. The differences between the genres are still palpable (analogous to fat, cat, sat), but they are each treated as a unit equivalent to one another, together making up the plot. For texts like Sinuhe , then, the analysis of the poetics of pain includes not just attending to the language at the level of line or couplet, but also to the macro structure, at the level of plot or narrative discours e. I will return to the significance of the above passage in Chapter 4, where I discuss the poetics of pain in the literary narratives. 1.4.3 Genres Another level of contextualizing the meaning of pain consists of the consideration of the textual tradit ion, or the genre, in which individual texts are participating. Closely related to the word genus used for biological classification, genre essentially describes the practice of classifying texts.60 The question of genre brings into focus an important inte rpretive principle that a lexical survey or literary analysis alone cannot address. There have been extended discussions on genres within Egyptology.61 In terms of genre classification systems (such as what falls into literary and non -literary) and labels used for designating specific texts groups (narratives, teachings, laments, etc.), I follow the practices current today in Egyptological 60 Literature on genre is extensive. On genre in general, Williams 1977; Fowler 1982. On genre in linguistic anthropology/sociolinguistics: Hanks 1987; Briggs and Bauman 1992; Bauman 1999. 61 For an overview of the history of \"genre theory\" in Egyptology, see Schenkel 1996, 21 -46; Vinson 2004, 38 -46; Lepper and Enmarch 2013, 2 -3. Also valuable is Gumbrecht 1996, 31 -8 which contextualizes the developments in literary debates in Egyptology against the developments in literary studies at large. In general, there has been a shift in orientation from the formalist to anthropological perspectives. 25 scholarship.62 These will be introduced as the chapters progress. My primary concern in this introductory chapter is to draw attention to certain conceptual aspects of genre formation that are congruent with my overarching aim of examining historical and cultural horizons of pain's meaning. In this and the following sections, I explain how the generic perspective can enhan ce understanding of the meanings of pain in the Egyptian texts by mediating the poetics of pain on one hand, and enduring cultural values on the other. To this end, I start by turning to a strand of genre theory that has been influential in other disciplin es but has not received as much attention in Egyptology: the theory of speech genre by Mikhail Bakhtin. A Russian literary critic of the twentieth century, Bakhtin wrote extensively on theories of literature and on the closely related topic of theories of language. Reacting against Saussure's approach which privileged langue (system) over parole (use), Bakhtin emphasizes the communicative aspect of language and takes utterance as the primary locus of analysis.63 In his essay \"The Problem of Speech Genres,\" Bakhtin writes: These utterances reflect the specific conditions and goals of each such area not only through their content (thematic) and linguistic style, that is, the selection of the lexical, phraseological, and grammatical resources of the language, but above all through their compositional structure. All three of these aspects \u2014thematic content, style, and compositional structure \u2014are inseparably linked to the whole of the utterance and are equally determined by the specific nature of the particular sp here of communication . Each separate utterance is individual, of course, but each sphere in which language is used develops its own relatively stable types of these utterances. These we may call speech genres .64 Bakhtin's approach to genre is particularly compelling in that it not only considers formal and 62 In addition to the essays included in the edited volumes 1996 (ed. Loprieno) 1999 (ed. Moers), the most extensive treatment on genres is found in Parkinson's 2002 monograph. See especially Parkinson 2002, 22 -36 for the summary of his perspective on genre. An edited volume of a more relatively recent date (2013, eds. Enmarch and Lepper) includes a few essays that touch on the question of genre, but none provides a thorough theoretical discussion. 63 To be sure, although Bakhtin's utterance overlaps with Saussure's parole , it is not the direct equivalent. Holquist 1983, 310. 64 Bakhtin 1986, 60. Emphasis mine. 26 functional contexts as inseparably joined, but also highlights the reflexive relation between the two: a particular sphere of communication creates its own speech genre; it is by the particular speech th at the sphere of communication is defined. Bakhtin then goes on to make distinctions between the so -called primary genre and the secondary genre. The two differ in the nature of the relationship between the sphere of communication and the utterances. Prima ry genres refer to everyday speaking styles that are immediately determined by social situations. Secondary genres, to which all kinds of artistic and scientific discourses belong (usually in written forms), have more complex and mediated communicative sit uations. Bakhtin explains the nature of secondary genres in relation to primary genres as follows: During the process of their (secondary) formation, they absorb and digest various primary genres that have taken form in unmediated speech communication. The se primary genres are altered and assume a special character when they enter into complex ones. They lose their immediate relation to actual reality and to the real utterances of others . For example, rejoinders of everyday dialogue or letters found in a no vel retain their form and their everyday significance only on the plane of the novel as a whole, that is, as a literary -artistic event and not as everyday life. The novel as a whole is an utterance just as rejoinders in everyday dialogue or private letters are...but unlike these, the novel is a secondary utterance.65 That secondary genres are not determined by immediate social situations is an important insight, and it pushes back against the tendency among those who distinguish genres in socio -functional terms to assimilate genres to a specific occasion ( Sitz im Leben ), which results in a proliferation of genres.66 The extent to which secondary genres \"absorb and digest\" the characteristics of primary genres can vary. The mentioned example of everyday dialogue or letters in a novel can be seen as an extreme case, adduced to illustrate the point that even utterances that cannot formally be distinguished from primary utterances, once appropriated into the frame of a secondary genre, \"lose their immediate relation to actual reality.\" We can use this insight from 65 Bakhtin 1986, 62. Emphasis mine. 66 This tendency is mentioned in Parkinson 2002, 35. 27 Bakhtin to think about the mediated nature of the represen tation of pain in the Egyptian texts. The Egyptian texts that are examined in this dissertation all belong to secondary genres, which include not just the literary genres, but also non -literary genres like the medico -magical texts. Though the language empl oyed may have derived certain elements from everyday language at one point (this, of course, can only be speculated), overall, it is far removed from everyday language. Their compositional structure and content are not a direct transposition of everyday experience. This means that the language and representation of pain in these texts, too, are not directly determined by the immediate contact with pain, i.e., by any specific instance or individual experience of pain. While this may sound like common sense, stating it explicitly can help dispel the bias of treating pain references in medico -magical texts as more \"real\" and closer to everyday experience of pain than those found in literary texts. The most salient aspect of Bakthin's theory of speech genre is its potential for providing a conceptual framework that registers both the intersubjective and historical dimensions of pain. Embedded in the Bakhtinian generic perspective is the idea of dialogicity, that all utterances are responses to prior utterances.67 Bakhtin saw that secondary genres, unlike primary genres, undergo \"the process of historical formation.\"68 This is to say, metaphorically speaking, secondary genre is the product of texts entering a prolonged dialogue with other texts. This observation e mphasizes the interconnectedness of the texts as well as to the interconnectedness of people. It also resists treating genre as a set of abstract rules that are unilaterally imposed on 67 Bakthin 1986, 91: \"Each utterance is filled with echoes and reverberations of other utterances to which it is related by the commu nality of the sphere of speech communication. Every utterance must be regarded primarily as a response to preceding utterances of the given sphere (we understand the \"response\" here in the broadest sense). Each utterance refutes, affirms, supplements, and relies on the others, presupposes them to be known, and somehow takes them into account.\" It is worth mentioning the concept of \"intertextuality,\" another concept that has been frequently invoked in discussion on Egyptian literature, results from Kristeva' s 1980, 64 -91translation and interpretation of Bakhtin's notion of dialogism. 68 Bakhtin 1986, 62. 28 individual texts. Genres do not exist outside the individual texts, but emerge as texts choose to adhere to (or transform) the form and content of prior texts. In this view, the occurrence of the same formulae, devices, etc., across the texts are not mere repetitions; rather, each constitutes an active response to a prior ins tance. Now, what would constitute the sphere of communication for Egyptian texts? What I have in mind here is not the social function or the performative context, but the communicative situation borne out of their status as written artifacts. All the text s that are examined in the subsequent chapters are written on papyrus (with a few exceptions of those found on ostraca), which have survived the vagaries of time only because they had been carefully stored. In my view, even without active production of tex ts, simply preserving the texts is akin to participation in the dialogical process. Sometimes we see texts claiming their content had been handed down from older texts.69 Although these statements cannot be taken at face value, at the very least, they inform us of the Egyptian concern for \"maintaining the dialogue.\" Each generation becomes a potential participant, and the dialogue can span centuries. And like in face -to-face dialogue, the content of what is communicated is not limited to what is explicitly said, but rather includes the entire package of assumptions, beliefs, values, attitudes, etc. Bakhtin notes that the utterance is filled with dialogic overtones [...]. After all, our thought itself \u2014 philosophical, scientific, and artistic \u2014is born and shaped in the process of interaction and struggle with others' thought, and this cannot but be reflected in the forms that verbally express our thought as well.70 It is within such dialogical context that I would like to situate the poetics and cultural meanin gs of pain. Insofar as textual genres serve as the medium of participation for shared knowledge and traditions, the poetics of pain does not remain an autonomous aesthetic entity, but its meaning 69 Further discussed in 3.3. 70 Bakhtin 1986, 92. 29 becomes enlivened by shared ways of thinking and feeling abo ut pain, transferable across a vast span of time and space. 1.5 Chapter Organization The remainder of the dissertation is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, pain is examined at lexical, syntactic, and phraseological levels. I compile the words and phras es related to pain and examine their semantic and grammatical properties. The primary goal within the scope of this chapter is to lay a lexicographical foundation for more thematic in -depth textual analysis in the later chapters. Chapters 3 through 5 con stitute the main body chapters. The corpus examined in the dissertation is broadly divided into two categories: non -literary (or functional) and literary. The texts examined in Chapter 3 belong to the first category. The literary genre is further divided i nto narrative and non -narrative texts, which are examined in chapters 4 and 5, respectively. Texts examined in each chapter differ in content, form and purpose; each has its distinct epistemological underpinning and distinct ways of justifying references t o pain. I therefore tailor my contextualizing strategies accordingly and modulate the internal organization of the discussions from chapter to chapter. I achieve overall coherence among the chapters not by imposing a unifying framework but by revisiting in each chapter the following questions: a. Did the Egyptians distinguish different kinds of pain, comparable to the way physical pain is distinguished from emotional pain in modern Western society? What is the role of the heart in ancient Egyptian thought in relation to pain? Can a better understanding of the role of the heart in ancient Egyptian thought clarify the conceptual ambiguities involved in pain? b. What is the role of language vis -\u00e0-vis pain in Egyptian texts? Are there any significant differences amo ng the textual genres the way language is used in framing and explaining pain? 30 c. What meaning(s), if any, did ancient Egyptians give to pain? What is the ethical significance of pain and suffering in ancient Egyptian thought? How did they understand pain in relation to their core values and beliefs? With these questions in mind, in Chapter 3, I turn to Papyrus Edwin Smith and Papyrus Ebers , the two best preserved medical texts from ancient Egypt, and examine pain from the perspective of ancient Egyptian me dicine and healing practices. In the first part of the chapter, I trace and unpack the textual references to pain in the records of medical diagnosis and treatment. I show that overall, pain is primarily understood in reference to a disruptive processes/st ate or elements involved therein rather than in reference to painful sensation felt by patients. However, whereas pain is framed as a physiological problem, subject to empirical observation and measurement during the examination and diagnosis, in the treat ment stage, pain is viewed as a reality or force to be contended with. In the second part of the chapter, I delineate the context within which the Egyptian understandings of and responses to pain examined in the first part operated as a part of coherent d iscourse. The role the pharaonic kingship played in the development and flourishing of medical practices cannot be over exaggerated, especially the aspect of the pharaoh as the guarantor of maat . By interweaving various strands of evidence, I suggest that the Egyptian medical accounts of pain are likely to be closely associated with the pharaonic kingship and maat . Chapter 4 examines a wide range of texts grouped under the label of literary narratives, which include Sinuhe , the Shipwrecked Sailor, and the Eloquent Peasant from the Middle Kingdom; the Two Brothers and Horus and Seth from the Ramesside period; and the Misfortunes of Wenamun and the Tale of Woe from the Third Intermediate Period. Informed by narratological theories, I consider pain in term s of plot by paying close attention to the ways which the formal features of the narratives such as parallelism and repetition, framing devices, patterns of 31 indexical expressions, etc. give shape to pain undergone by the characters in the narratives. I als o consider how representation of pain elicits affective response from the audience. In Chapter 5, I turn to two groups of poetic texts that are known for their particularly effusive emotions: the so -called literary laments (alternatively known as pessimis tic discourses) and the Ramesside love songs. The primary concern in this chapter is to address the relationship between aesthetics, emotions and pain. The select passages from these genres are subject to poetic analysis that centers on the sense of \"movem ent,\" and pain is explored as an aspect of longing on the part of both the speakers and audience. Chapter 6 concludes the dissertation. Here I bring together the various strands of analysis and findings of each chapter into a unified whole and use this a ccount as a vehicle for a final reflection on ancient Egyptian meanings of pain. I end by exploring the theoretical and methodological implications of this dissertation and making some suggestions for future research avenues. 32 CHAPTER 2 Lexicography of Pain 2.1 Introduction This chapter provides a lexicographical survey of pain in ancient Egyptian. It goes without saying that, for a dead language like ancient Egyptian, the procedures for identification of the meanings of words are far from straightforward.1 Moreover, the inherent ambiguity and multifaceted nature of pain creates additional challenges for both data collection and analysis. An exhaustive lexicography of pain in ancient Egyp tian therefore would require a monograph length study. Within the confines of one chapter, I will focus on compiling the common words for pain in ancient Egyptian and on explicating their basic meanings, which can be used as a reference tool for in -depth a nalysis in the subsequent chapters. 2.2 Data Collection 2.2.1 Egyptian Words for Pain The pressing question is: how does one go about looking for the expressions for pain? I began with compiling the list of the Egyptian words that have been translated as pain2 and looking at their textual attestations. To this end, I consulted the various Egyptological resources available \u2014dictionaries, text editions and commentaries. More specifically, my initial word list was compiled using the Digitalisierte Zettelarch iv (DZA), the digitized card catalogue used to assemble the of the Worterbuch der agyptischen Sprach (Wb.), and the Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae (TLA). Using the reverse translation function of the DZA and TLA, I searched for the 1 On methodological challenges for lexicography of dead languages, see Ashdowne 2015, 350 -366. See also the seminal articles by Gunn 1941 and Gardiner 1948 that describe the various challenges specific to ancient Egyptian lexicography. 2 This entails that the meaning(s) of the Egyptian pain words already reflects the modern scholars' understanding of the meaning of pain. 33 Egyptian words for Schmer z and schmerzen . Because Leiden and Krankenheit are frequently listed with Schmerz in the definitions of word like mn and mr, I also used Leiden and Krankenheit (as well as their verb counterparts) for the next round of the search. The Egyptian words from these searches were then re -searched in other dictionaries dictionary and Worterbuch der medizinischen Texte (MedWb); I also tried to recall the Egyptian texts that deal with pain and went back to those texts to see if any explicit reference to pain is made, and if so, ad ded these expressions to the list. Finally, I consulted the individual text editions, philological commentaries and scholarly articles on specific words on the list if available. The list of the words thus compiled is summarized in Table 1. Table 1.

This can initially save a lot of time compared to using the Belegstellen volumes of the Worterbuch . 3 The downside of TLA, however, is that it only provides the transliteration and translation of the texts and no hieroglyphic transcription. What is more, s ometimes the TLA's transliteration and translation would differ from those provided in other publica tions, and it is difficult to judge for oneself which makes better sense unless you have a reliable copy of the hieroglyph transcription or the photograph of the original texts. Hence, even though one could start collecting examples using TLA, eventually t he examples have to be cross -referenced from the more \"conventional\" sources. Also, the textual references cited in the TLA are not exhaustive. Sometimes, much less exhaustive dictionaries such as Faulkner or Lesko would cite examples that are not cited in the TLA; sometimes I would simply fall upon examples that are not listed in any of the lexicons. All in all, the collection of the textual references was aided by TLA, but it still had to be significantly complemented by non -digital resources. 2.3 Claus al and Sentential Analysis In this section, I examine each word from 2.2.1 at clausal and sentential levels, using the textual references collected based on the method outlined in 2.2.2.4 The examples come from a wide range of texts, from monumental ins criptions to literary texts and private letters, and from a vast time range, from the Old Kingdom to the Third Intermediate Period. Where the peculiarity 3 For instance, for h (Wb. I, 12.2 -3), the Belegstellen gives \"2. Theb 6 (vom Namen).\" Each of these references have to be looked up separately from their respective publications. 4 Examples are representative but are not exhaustive. Not every single example is cited in the discussion, as many of them are repetitive (either verbatim repetition or very similar usage). 39 of the chronological or generic context has significant effect on the grammar and meaning of the word being examined, it will be discussed either in the paragraph or the footnotes. I have placed relatively less weight on finding the perfect translational choices for individual words than on making plain the syntactic environment in which the words appear for the following two reasons. First, while all the words in the list more or less signify pain, in many of these examples, they sound awkward when translated into English as \"pain.\" This should not be understood as having to do with the Egyptian words the mselves, but more to do with the constraint imposed by the syntax and semantics of the English word \"pain.\" Most significantly, \"pain\" is a noun, and in order to translate Egyptian pain verbs, it has to be rendered \"to suffer pain,\" \"to have pain,\" \"to be in pain,\" etc. While this may suffice to convey the general meaning, it does not do justice to the original syntax. Secondly, there is the problem of the language barrier I face as a non -native English speaker. Even if I were to come to develop a keen kno wledge of the various shades of the Egyptian words discussed in this chapter, I am not confident that that understanding would be directly reflected in the English translational choices I make. Only in -depth literary analysis would allow me to delineate su fficiently the meanings of the Egyptian words and how they signify pain in their contexts, and these tasks are reserved for the next three chapters. These two limitations on translation can be partially offset by rigorous syntactic analysis. Whether certain Egyptian words might be better translated as \"pain\", \"suffering\" or \"grief\" can vary from a person to person based on a number of factors; whether Egyptian words in particular instances be analyzed as adjectival or verbal, transitive or intransitive, varies much less. Syntactic analysis is especially helpful for words like mn and mr which appear interchangeable in many translations but differ signifi cantly in their syntactic behavior. 40 The basic grammatical framework and terminology used in this chapter (and for the rest of the dissertation) are based on Gardiner5 and Hoch.6 In addition to the traditional grammatical categories such as subject, di rect object and indirect object, I also consider the argument structure.7 Argument structure refers to formalization of the relation between the predicate and the argument (participant integral to the event or state expressed by the predicate) it selects. In essence, argument structure is concerned with how semantic features of verbs are associated with grammatical patterns. Depending on the semantic properties of a predicate, arguments can be as signed different semantic roles .8 While there is a frequent correspondence with grammatical categories and semantic roles (for instance, the role of agent usually corresponds to the subject of a transitive verb, while the role of patient/theme corresponds to the object of a verb), this is not always the case. For a common example, when a sentence in active voice turned to passive voice, the subject and the agent no longer correspond. In Gardiner and Hoch, terms such as logical subject and logical object are used to distinguish the semantic relation between the predicate and the argument from that of the purely grammatical one, in special cases such as the suffix pronoun of the infinitive or passive participles.9 The basic idea underlying semantic roles is similar, although labeling an argu ment by its semantic role has a benefit of being more intuitive and less abstract. 5 Gardiner 1973. 6 Hoch 1997. 7 In Egyptology, Vernus (2012) and Winand (2016) have applied the framework of argument structure for gaining a more fine -grained understanding of the meaning of the Egyptian lexemes. 8 There exist several different terms for a similar concept, among which are: participant roles , deep seman tic cases, thematic roles and theta () -roles . The standard set of semantic roles also vary from author to author. The roles listed in Table 3 represent the most commonly identified ones. 9 GEG \u00a7126; Hoch 1997, \u00a757. 41 Table 3. Semantic Roles Agent initiator of action, capable of acting with volition. The boy kicked the ball. Patient the entity undergoing the effect of an action, undergoes change of state. The boy kicked the ball . Goal the ending point towards which something moves. John went home . Source the starting point from which something moves. She ran from the angry dog. Theme the entity moved by action or whose location is described. The book is on the table. Experiencer the entity which is aware of the action or state but is not in control John has a headache. Instrument the means by which an action is performed or something comes about. Bill opened the door with a key . Beneficiary the entity for whose benefit the action is performed. Fred baked his mother a cake. Stimulus the entity which is perceived or experienced. Mary smelled the flower . In linguistics literature, pain is classified as a subtype of experiential situations .10 The domain of experience as understood in linguistics literature encompasses sensual perception, bodily sensations and feelings, cognitive processes, and emotional reactions.11 Experiential situations are ch aracterized by low transitivity.12 Figure 1 below repres ents the components of a basic experiential situation.13 Expertum is the content of what is being experienced and is generally expressed by the predicate . Experiencer refers the main participant of the situation, one 10 The account given here is based on t he information and references provided in Verhoeven 2007, Fedriani 2014 and Luraghi 2021, all of which take a functional, typological approach to language. Verhoeven 2007 draws on various function -based approaches (e.g.,Van Valin and LaPolla 1997) and prov ides a - syntactic study of experiential expressions in Yucatan Mayan. It also provides an accessible overview of the relevant linguistics theories and terminology. Particularly useful is Chpater 3 where she discusses, among others, th e previous approaches to experiential constructions, the question of universality vs. culture -specificity of concepts in the domain of experience, the distinction between bodily sensation and bodily state, etc. Both Ferdriani 2014 and Luraghi 2021 draw on Verhoeven 2007 and examine experiential constructions i n ancient languages \u2014Latin and Homeric Greek, respectively . 11 In linguistics literature, pain is primarily identified as a bodily sensation, and secondarily, as an emotion by metaphorical/metonymic ass In addition, according to the transitivity hierarchy of different types experiential predicates proposed by Tsunoda (1985), perception (verbs of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell) ranks the highest, followed by cognition (thinking and knowing), emotion, and sensation. For Egyptologists with linguistics background, this topic would provide a rich avenue for future inquiry. 13 The diagram is from Verhoeven 2007, 52, which is al so reproduced in Luraghi 2021, 2. Cf. Fedriani 2014, 19. 42 who experiences.14 Stimulus is the second participant, which represents the cause that triggers the experience , or that to which the experience is d irected. These two participants, experiencer and s timulus (indicated bold in T able 3 ), are the first and second arguments of experiential predicates .15 Treating Egyptian p ain predicates as encoding an experiential situation, my analysis below will delineate their semantics in reference to the semantic roles of experiencer and stimulus. Figure 1. Components of an Experiential Situation (from Verhoeven 2007 ) 2.3.1 h/h As a h translated as \"to suffer\" or \"to be miserable.\" It picks out a single argument of experiencer, which is encoded as the subject. (1) m h{} n ww 14 The neither agent - nor patient -like status of the experiencer is often understood as what accounts for a great diversity in the ways in which experiential situations are encoded. Different linguis ts have expressed the difficulty of defining the experiencer role. For an overview, see Fedriani 2014, 20ff. Verhoeven ( 2007, 52) additionally notes that \"the experiencer participates through its physicalness and intellectuality in the situation which may be linguistically rendered by the use of material or immaterial body or person part nouns. (Im)material person parts are involved in the situation as parts of the experiencer. They are thus thought of as being on a secondary level; their participation being given by the experiencer. \" 15 Fedriani 2014, 15: \" the Experiencer and the Stimulus are particularly intriguing semantic roles to explore phenomena at the syntax -semantics interface, since their conceptual characterization is complex in different respects and can have a number of consequences at the level of linguistic coding. A relational comparison on the ontological axis identifies Experiencers as human by definition, whereas Stimuli can, but need not, be animate. This makes Experiencers good candidates for attaining syntactic and pragmatic primacy over Stimuli. Stimuli, in turn, can be interpreted as Source - or Cause -like and are therefore entitled to be expressed as subject as well, due to their status as initiators of events.\" Further on characterization of these two roles, refer to Chapter 2 of the sa me volume. 43 \"I should not suffer because of/from shiplessness.\" bf rf \"So his heart becomes shorn, while his face miserable , because his heart acts against him.\" ( Ptahhotep 4, 8-9)18 In (1), h is a negatival complement of the prospective form of the negative verb m. The 1cs suffix pronoun represents the subject experiencer. The prepositional phrase n ww can be taken as an adjunct or possibly a dative object (in which case, it represents the semantic role of stimulus, a second argument). In (2), the stative h.w, though not a predicate per se ( i.e., it is not a predicate of a main clause), is still in a p redicative relationship with its antecedent rf. Here, the 3ms suffix pronoun f is the experiencer. In both cases, h seems to connote a situation suffering related to a lack of some sort.19 In (1), h is related to the state of not having a ship (the s olar barque that the deceased needs ride on to join Re's journey); in (2), though it is not about an actual lack, h.w parallels the stative fk.w \"to be shorn\" (=lacks hair), and it seems h.w, with its connotation of lack, was chosen for a rhetorical pur pose of extending the metaphor. The substantive form of h is attested as hw and in its later variant h.20 There are instances that seem to indicate suffering specifically related to a lack of something, comparable to the usage in (1) and (2). hw in (3) refers to a suffering related to lack of food, in light of the sentence that immediately follows. The sentence in (4) is preceded by an exhortation not to brag 16 Lapp 1997. 17 TLA ( lemma -no. 305) has k.w as simply a verb relating to heart. Cf. Wb. I, 22.4. Here, I follow Allen's interpretation (2015, 188) of a possible scribal omission of the suffix pronoun after b. While k.w is not attested anywhe re else, fk.w is (e.g., Kamose Stele). The word in question seems most certainly connected to fk, \"be ruined, wasted.\" Wb. I, 579.16f. 18 This example is from BM 10409 (L2), following the column and line number assigned by Zaba 1956. Other citations of Ptahhotep in the chapter, unless indicated, follows the sequential numbers assigned by Devaud's edition of pPrisse. 19 Cf. Meeks 1977 77.0060 lists the idiomatic expression h m \"manquer de\" under h \"souffrir.\" See also Merikare E91 in example (183). 20 Cf. Breasted 1930, 138. 44 to those who are childless ( wty msw f),21 and is supposed to show how one's life success cannot be gauged by the number of children one has. Here, we can perhaps understand hw's connotation of lack as heightening the paradox: people who are not lacking in children are not necessarily better off than who lack children. In (5), too, hw brings out the paradox, as a play on the contrast with m, \"to be full.\" (3) nn hw msw r -gs \"There is no suffering for him to whom I give. I allot a lot of meat to those who sit by my side.\" (Stela of Montuser 9 kt r s \"There are many a father who is in distress , and a mother who has given birth, (yet) another being more content than she.\" ( Ptahhotep D171) (5) w m-b r hw \"He who trusts (lit. one with a full heart) is towards (prone to) a lack/ suffering .\" (Merikare E39)23 In other instances, hw/h does not seem to be associated with a state of lack (or at least, the association is not as salient) but refers to pain, distress or sorrow in a general sense, especially in the literary laments. (6) b w r sd h \"My ba is too foolish to suppress pain .\" (Man and Ba 18) (7) shrr m r hw \"The pacifier a distress -maker.\" (Peasant 280) (8) pk w mk w m hw \"Reckon me, I am in distress .\" (Peasant R 26, 6) (9) h pw w b n m \"Responding to the ignorant is pain .\" (Khakhper reseneb vso. 4 -5) 21 . 23 For Merikare , the line numbers are according to P St -Petersburg 1116A, which is the most complete surviving manuscript. For the edition, Quack 1992. 45 In (6), h is the object of the verb sd, which is in infinitive form after the preposition r. (7) consists of two participles and m of predication inserted between the two. Syntactically, hw is in the bound construction with the participle of the verb r, but in terms of semantics, its relationship with the verb, namely, the semantic role of theme, is still retained. In (8) hw is the object of proposition m, and the prepositional phrase as a whole serves as an adverbial predicate of an independent cla use. The subject experiencer is represented by the 1cs dependent pronoun w, after the initial particle mk. In example (9), h is first member in the tripartite A pw B sentence. In magico -medical texts, hw/h refers to an injury or physical ailment. I t frequently occurs as an object of preposition followed by a suffix pronoun or demonstrative. In Edwin Smith, where it occurs 12 times, it refers to a specific injury or wound, i.e., the localized physiological damage.24 In Ebers, where it occurs in the context of stomach related problems and a magical incantation, it seems to refer to an entity underlying the ailment. (10) r sw t hf \"until the period of his of him having this injury .\" (pEdwin Smith 4,16) (12) r nm gb w m h \"until the arm becomes well, free of pain .\" (pEbers 37, 15) (13) w h pn hy r qb m r pyt... \"this pain has down to rectum and (pEbers 37, 16)25 (14) nn b h dw... \"I have brought this and given in place of this, replacing the pain that is raging...\" (pEbers 57, 21) 24 See Breasted 1930, 135 for the discussion. 25 Notice that though (12) and (13) come from the same text, same column, and indeed the same recipe, the spellings differ. It is also worth mentioning that although the content of the latter half of the column 37 is repeated in the latter half of the column 38, in 38, 16, instead of h like 37, 16, h is used. 46 It also occurs in the BD where it parallels the word mr and is the (semantic role of) theme of dr. (15) drsn h mr mn f dr ws r hf \"may they drive off pain and illness he suffers; may Osiris drive off his pain .\" (BD 130 = pNu 15) 2.3.2 nd/n Like h, nd/n is a one -place predicate that selects a subject experiencer. The known attestations are predominantly in stative constructions, which are custom arily translated as \"to be afflicted.\" In (16) -(18), y nb, f and st serve as the respective antecedents, which express the role of the experiencer. In (19), nd is a negatival complement of the negative imperative m, and the 3ms suffix f is the experiencer. (16) wn m mnt r ty n y nb n.w \"I was a nurse taking care of all who arrived afflicted .\" (Hatnub 16, 9 -10)26 (17) sprf r pr f nd.w md.n sw mt \"He arrives at his house afflicted , the journey having pressed him hard.\" ( Khety 13, 6)27 (18) nn w s pw mr nn sb s pw n st nd.t \"Isn't that a wailing of a miserable person? Isn't that a crying of an afflicted woman?\" (BM EA 9997 3, w.w m r mw m r fn \"Do not let him be afflicted, do not let him be afflicted , do not make foul water, do not make white water, do not make maggots\"! (pLeiden I 348, spell 36)29 It is only with the knowledge of the generic context (or the situations implied by the genre) that the word's meaning can be further specified in each passage. In (16), the fact that it comes from a graffiti at the major expedition site as well as the verb of motion y suggest that n.w here refers to the fatigue or exhaustion that commonly accompanies a long journey. In (17), too, 26 Anthes 1928. 27 Repeated in 16, 3. Column and line numbers for Khety follow J\u00e4ger 2004. The cited variant is from tLouvre N 693 rto. 8. 28 Leitz 1999. 29 Borghouts 1971. 47 words like spr and mt suggest that nd.w has to do with the fatigue from a long journey. The passage comes from the Teachi ng of Khety or the so -called the \"Satire on the Trades\" where all professions but that of scribe are negative portrayed in highly exaggerated language, and nd.w is meant to highlight the hardship of wty, \"field workers.\"30 (18) comes from a healing incantation,31 and two things are relevant to for grasping the meaning of nd here. First, parallelism enabled by the repetition of nn... s pw n... suggests that st nd.ti is complentary in meaning to mr, \"miserable person.\" Second, the woman here refers to none other than Isis, who is crying over Horus'condition. Isis' anguish over the well -being of her son is a trope that is frequently featured in medico -magical spells. (19), too, comes from a healing incantation. As the negative command with nd is followed by three more negative commands with specific symptoms, nd is to be understood as meaning a state or expereince that is caused by those symptoms . 2.3.3 hm The word hm has several different spellin gs, such as hm(t) or even hm. It is not widely attested, being only attested from the New Kingdom and onwards. It mainly occurs in the Ramesside royal hymns in the context of praising the protection and wise governance by the king. As a verb, it is translated as \"to suffer.\" As a noun, it has been variously translated as \"affliction,\" \"woe,\" or \"lament.\"32 (20) \"There is no sleeper among you one who suffers from a lack ( i.e., none of you go to sleep at night, lacking anything).\" (K RI II, 340f = CG 34504)33 30 Wb. I, 214.7 -9. 31 This is a particular type of spell called historiola (lit. \"little story\"), in which mythical precedents serve as a model for healing. Historiola is further discussed in the next chapter. 32 In addition to the cited examples, there is a possible attestation in Cai ro JE 44065 (= stela of Padisobek from Hawara ), where the deceased narrates his illness and impotence that he suffered in his lifetime. The reading is, however, extremely uncertain, and no reliable hand -copy exists.

As a one -place predicate, it selects a subject experiencer and can be translated as \"to suffer\" in a general sense. In (24), the subjunctive form of wd is used as the object of r 'to know,' to form a \"that\" clause (alternatively it can be analyzed as the nominal form to mean \"how much you suffer\" instead of \"that you suffer\"). The experiencer is expressed by the 2ms suffix pronoun, maat) perishing from the beloved land.\" (Great Abydos Stela of Ramses IV, 14 = K RI VI, 23) As a two -place predicate, which selects a second argument of theme, wd has a meaning and usage comparable to English \"to endure\", \"to tolerate,\" or wd \"Furthermore, will any of you tolerate having his wife denounced to him? Then, I would tolerate (it, too).\"38 (Heqanakht II -43)39 (26) wty{w} wn-bf wdw sfnw 34 Medinet Habu the first Libyan war (year 5), line 67 SAOC 12:33; OIP 8, pl.28. 35 Medinet Habu the Sea People war (year 8), line 28 SAOC 12:56; OIP 8, pl.46. 36 Wb.

According to Fisher -Elfert (1999, 74 -75), the expression indicates a gesture of complaint, comparable to rt r tp/, \"a hand on the head.\" 37 The example comes from a hymn of Ramses IV, on the occasion of the king returning to Thebes for renewal or regeneration. The section in which this particular phrase occurs sings of all the evils no longer endured under the current reign of peace. Foster 1994, 96. 38 A similar instance of a n-w rhetorical question followed by + subjunctive is also found in Peasant B1 148 - 150. 39 Allen 2002. 49 \"One who is without greed, who endures irritation...\" (Louvre C 167, 9)40 (27) n wd.nf n ib m r wd \"Would that I had a heart able to endure .\" (Khakhper reseneb rto. 13 -14) (29) n wd.tw sm n mdt \"The reply to a speech is not tolerated .\" (Khakhper reseneb vso. 5) In (25), the first wd is an infinitive after r of futurity, where w mn expresses the subject experiencer and sr.w nf mtf, the object theme.42 As for the second wd, only the first argument (the subject experiencer, ) is explicitly expressed, while the second argument is implied: the same sr.w nf mtf from the preceding sentence is the object theme of the second wd as well . In (26), wdw is an active participle in bound construction with sfnw, which, like in (7), retains the semantic relationship as the theme. In (27), wd is in a nominal sm.nf after negative n, indicating inability. The 3ms suffix pronoun expresses the subject experiencer, and the following NP bsw is the direct object theme. In (28), wd is the object of r (here indicating ability). The first argument is b, and the second argument is on ly implied by the context: in the section preceding the cited passage, the speaker has been lamenting how his own heart is unresponsive to the great suffering he is under. What is implied as the object theme of wd here is therefore the suffering the speak er is under. In (29), wd is passive with an impersonal pronoun tw. The NP sm n mdt is the single argument (theme) of the predicate, but had this been in active voice, it would be a second argument, expressing the object theme. The noun wdw occurs very frequently in the medical texts. It is followed by the pustule 40 Landgr\u00e1fov\u00e1 2011. 41 For pBerlin 3038, Grapow 1958. 42 Following Allen 2002, 47, sr.w nf mtf is taken as a prospective passive, instead of a circumstantial passive smf with final w. If taken as a circumstantial passive, this would decrease the valency of wd to a one -place predicate. 50 determinative (Aa2).43 There are conflicting views on exactly what wdw refers to, whether it refers to an inflammatory process, pathogenic substance, principle of putrefaction, or pain itself.44 A variety of verbs take wdw as an argument. (30) -(36) come from the rubric of the recipes from pEbers, where wdw is the object pa tient of different verbs of healing. In (37) - (40), wdw occurs as a single argument of a few different one -place predicates, especially of verbs of motion.45 (30) kt nt dr wdw \"Another for driving out pain .\" (pEbers 27, 5) (31) kt nt sm wdw \"Another for slaying pain .\" (pEbers 24, 12) kt nt s wdw \"Another for breaking pain.\" (pEbers 30, 3) (33) kt nt sf wdw m t \"Another for subduing pain in the belly.\" (pEbers 23, 4) (34) kt nt dr w w dt wdw \"Another for driving out pain and taking out pain.\" (pEbers 26, 20) (35) kt nt srw ty srwy wdw \"Another for treating the heart and removing pain .\" (pEbers 45, 18) (36) kt nt tp mr f sst wdw \"Another for head that is ill, discarding pain .\" (pEbers 48, 7 -8) (37) kt nt ssnb wbnw wdw pr \"Another for healing the wound when pain occurs.\" (pEbers 30, 4) (38) wdw pw th r psd f \"It is pain which trespassed on his back.\" (pEbers 40, 6) (39) r wdw r tyf \"Pain falls on his heart...\" (pEbers 101, 10) 43 Interpretation of this determinative varies. Gardiner ( 1950, 539) describes it as a pustule or gland see it as two fingers on an open wound. 44 A thorough discussion on wdw with bibliography is given in Tessenow Kolta 2000. 45 The movement of wdw is referred hbhb wdw (pEbers 103, forth.\" (pBerlin 3038 -7) Interestingly, wdw frequently occurs in the incantations where different harmful supernatural forces or evil entities are enumerated.

Its attestations are concentrated in the autobiographical inscriptions and the literary laments. The generic context and the range of predicates with which it is frequently collocated seems to indicate that its meaning partially overlaps with hw/h, and hm.

IV, 1076, 10) With a seated man determinative (A1), mr/mr means one who is miserable, a wretched man or a pauper. We have already seen in (18) above, where it is paralleled by nd. Usually, it constitutes a part of the common stock phrases in autobiography from the OK and onwards, referring to those living on th e margins of society, whom the elites are responsible to provide protection from the powerful and strong.

In (60) and (61), mr occurs as part of the epithets of different deities (or the likes), to whom is the credited the role of a righteous judge.

Example (15), where it refers to Isis. 54 London Medical Papyrus. Leitz 1999. 55 Gasse 2.3.6 mn As -place as \"to suffer\" or \"be in pain\" in a general sense. In (62), mn.nk is a nominal sm.nf after negative n, expressing the negation of the present. The experiencer is expressed by the 2ms suffix pronoun, which encodes the grammatical subject as well. (62) n sf.n k n mn.nk n sksk.n k \"you do not pity, you do not suffer , you do not destroy.\" (Peasan t B1 348) In the magico -medical texts, mn frequently occurs as a two -place predicate that selects a body part or illness localized in a body part as the second argument. (63) r ik s r mn r-bf \"If you examine a man who suffering in his stomach...\" (pEbers 37, 10) (64) r ik s r mn n m r-bf \"If you examine a man suffering the blockage in his abdomen...\" (pEbers 39, 21) (65) m s r mn tw nw pwyt \"...like a man who is suffering the heat of the anus.\" (pEbers 36, 7) (66) wnn. n wsr r mn f m- tw n tf nty m f \"Thereupon Osiris was suffering in his head from the heat of his atef crown, which sits on his head ...\" ( BD 175 = pCha, 44)56 (67) s r -rt m wrt \"Now Isis is suffering in her rear as a pregnant woman, her months being completed according to the number of pregnancy...\" (pLeiden I 348 vso. 11, 4) (68) mnd pw nn mn.n st m -bt m msts w n tfnt \"These are the breasts which Isis had pain in in Chemmis during her bearing of Shu and Tefnut\" (pEbers 95, 7 -8) In (63) -(65), s (referring to the patient) is the subject experiencer of the pseudo verbal r+mn progressive circumstantial predicate. In (63), the body part r-bf is expressed as an independent argument, corresponding to the direct object and patient of the predicate.57 In (64) and (65), the 56 Schiaparelli 1927. 57 For the list of different body parts that occur as the direct object of mn in the medical texts, see MedWb 366 -367. 55 body parts r-bf and pwyt, are not themselves independent arguments. The second arguments in these examples are rather the sources of pain (or diseases), n and tw, respectively,58 and the more appropriate semantic role would be the stimulus rather than the patient. The body parts are only obliquely encoded. In (64), the body part is realized as locative phrase and in (65), as an indirect genitive. (66), which is part a of spell fro m the Book of Dead, features the same construction as (63), where the experiencer is realized as the subject, and the body part f is realized as the direct object. Here, the stimulus is introduced by the preposition m-. Both (67) and (68) refer to Is is' pain experiences related to her pregnancy. (67) is interesting for the choice of pwy59 as the body part involved in birth pain, and for the clause starting with m of predication,60 which, instead of directly expressing the stimulus,61provides the back ground information on the experiencer. In (68), instead of the r + mn + body part construction, A pw B construction is used to encode the similar information, where mn is a relative sm.nf. While having a body part as (a part of) the second argument is very common, this does not seem necessary. (69) nm.n nr pwy m - nw n r mnf mr pn \"I saved that god from those who made him suffer this illness/pain\" (BD 102 = pJuja, 827)62 (70) qs D17) (71) b pw mn.nf gwt heart that has suffered your absence.\" (pMoskau 167, Frg. II, 2)63 58 For the list of different diseases or medical conditions that occur as the direct object of mn in the medical texts, see MedWb 365 -366. 59 Wb. I, 535.14 -537.1; n mnty sy, \"examination of a woman aching in her rear, her front, and the calves of her thighs.\" 60 The first wrt is followed by the additional female person determinative (B1), in addition to the pregnant woman determinative (B2). The second wrt only has B2. 61 Compare with (72) and (158) where msss is used. 62 Munro 1994. 63 See pMoskau pMoskau pw ntt r mns qsn mss s \"My ladies, look, it is the woman who is suffering , her giving birth being painful.\" (pWestcar 10, 4) In (69), the second argument is simply mr pn, \"this illness,\" without any reference to a specific body part. In (70) and (71), the second argument is realized by w and gwt, which are rather abstract negat ive conditions. In (72), the 3fs suffix pronoun s is the logical direct object of mn, but its referent coincides with the referent of the subject, the relative ntt, which refers back to st. In other words, mn here is used reflexively, and both the subject and direct object encode the experiencer. While the circumstantial clause qsn msss explains the cause of the pain, it lies outside of the argument structure of the predicate r mn , so it can't be considered as its argument. A substantive mnt (frequently written without t), too, is widely attested. In the magico - medical texts, it refers to an injury, illness or pain felt by the patient. (73) (the list of ingredients...) r m t w.t wt mnt rs \"make (all the ingredients) into one and bandage the injury with it.\" (pEbers 46, 19)64 (74) r nk mntf rf \"If (physician) inquire (about) his pain from him (patient)\" (pEdwin Smith 8, 1) (75) ptr sw tp r mnt mf \"Look, it is the head that causes suffering in him. \" (pLeiden I 348, spell 17, 10, 6) Outside the medical texts, the term is used as a general term for something evil that involves suffering or pain that is not related to the phys ical injury or illness. In (76) -(78), mnt is the object of verb r. In (79), the opposition in meaning between mnt and t parallels the contrast between m and r. Examples (80) -(82) all come from the same text of Khakhper reseneb , and mnt figures as the argument of different verbs ( s, sr, dr) and of adjectival predicates ( w, wdn). (76) stwt m r verb gs \"anoint\": pEbers 80, 7. 57 \"one who is supposed to balance is being a doer of evil.\" (Peasant B1 281)65 (77) mk r mnt nbt r r \"you shall do any evil against my saying...\" ( E138) (78) n r any evil on anyone.\" (BD 125 = pNu 11) (79) mf r m m t m mnt \"he sees knowledge as ignorance, what is excellence as evil.\" (Ptahhotep D577 \"I would enlighten him (my heart) about my pain ...and I would express to him my suffering (caused) by him.\" ( Khakhper reseneb rto. 8) (81) dr nf cast off my pain rto. 14) (82) w.w(y) wdn heavy is my pain !\" (Khakhperreseneb vso. 4) There is a compound expression, sn-mnt, with meaning \"distress\" or \"calamity.\"66 This expression occurs in the context of describing the disruption of the world order. The expression will be dealt in greater depth in chapter 5. (83) bgw m pt nw m dwt sn-mnt m... \"Shouting is in the heaven, woes in the underworld, distress in....\" (pBerli n di nk t pn m sn-mn(t) \"I shall show to you the land in calamity .\" (Neferti 38)68 (86) wnn t m sn-mnt \"The land was in calamity.\" (Restoration Stela 8) 65 This line parallels the example (4).

Neferti 54. 58 2.4.7 mr69 Among all the words in this list, mr is most widely attested, not simply in terms of the number of attestations, but also in terms of the generic and chronological range of the texts in which it is attested. When translated into English, the semantic range of mr seems to overlap with that of mn, for mr too covers the meaning of \"to be ill\", \"to be in pain\" or \"to unlike mn, mr is an adjective verb (verb of quality), so its syntactic behavior differs from that of mn. As expected of its adjectival root, its use as an attributive ad jective and predicate adjective is common. (87) kt nt dr s mr m t nt s \"Another to expel painful excrement from the belly of a man.\" (pEbers 10, 9) (88) t pw mrt nt bw \"It is a painful disease of the btw serpent.\" ( Ptahhotep 301) (89) rwy sd dpt.n f sn t mr \"How happy is he who relates what he has experienced when something painful passes.\" (ShS 123-125). (90) mr nfy r nr.w \"Wrongdoing the gods.\" (Qaw 6) (91) mr.wy r nb tm m rk \"How painful it is to me, my lord, to not see your face.\" (BD 175 = pCha, 14) In (87) -(89), mr is used as an attributive adjective, following the noun it modifies. As can be seen, the nouns modified are not sentient and cannot be the experiencer. They themselves are not in the state of mr but have the quality of mr. And having the quality of mr, they can potentially be experienced by the sentient subject as causing pain (stimulus). In (90) -(91), mr is used as predicative adjective. In both cases, the subject (or the subject element?) expresses the stimulus; the oblique with the preposition r expresse s the experiencer. 69 There is an ongoing debate on whether the chisel grapheme is to be read mr or mr. See now Schweitzer 2011, 142-144 with previous literature. Throughout this dissertation, I follow the conventional reading mr. 59 In the following examples, the stative of mr is used as the adverbial predicate (stative) of the relative clause headed by the relative adjective nty/ntt. Notice that here, the antecedents are sentient (or body part of the sentient bein g) and represent the experiencer. (92) rd r ry t nt s nty mr \"place (it) against lower belly of the man who is ill.\" (pEbers 35, 10 ) (93) d mdw ft w pr.t r t nbt nt s ntt mr.t70 \"recitation when applying the recipe on every limb of a man that is ill.\" (pEbers 1, 11) (94) r t bk.t mw ntt mr.t \"as for this female servant Imw who is ill...\" (Cairo Bowl, 2 -3) It is also used as a verbal predicate (including relative or nominalized relative).

The 3ms suffix pronoun refers back to smk, \"your temple,\" a body part, rather than the whole person of the experiencer (Osiris). In (96) and (97), mr is a circumstantial smf used as a virtual relative . The suffix 70 The later variant (pHearst 6, 10) has an adjectival predicate (... mr sy ) but of adjectival sentences by means of nt- or wn/wnn is thought to be ungrammatical. See Loprieno, Muller and Uljas 2019, 718. 71 Spitting is a practice asso ciated with preventing or removing injuries. Allen 2015, 307 n. 94. 60 pronouns f and s refer back to the body parts tp and pwyt respectively. These t hree examples show that mr in verbal constructions do not require the subject to be the experiencer, unlike mn. In (98), mrf is a past (indicative) smf following the negative n. In (99), the verbal status of mr is indicated by the presence of w, which cannot precede an adjectival sentence. The whole clause of rmms w serves as the grammatical subject and theme of the predicate.72 In (100), the mr with the omitted 1cs subject is a prospective smf preceded by the particle k. The prepositional phrase n can be thought of as an adjunct, or part of a predicate forming an idiomatic expression for mr... n , \"to malinger.\" A body part that mr is frequently collocated with is the heart. In the magico -medical texts, recipes such as kt nt dr mrt b73 or prt nt dr mr b74 are listed among the recipes for ailments of other internal organs. Outside the magico -medical texts, mr is used frequently used in the construction that features a dative second argument, which the W\u00f6rterbuch gives an idiomatic translation Mitleid haben , \"to sympathize, pity.\" (101) s nf mns snq f sw \"Her heart will be pained for him, she will give him her breast so that he may suck it.\" (PT 508) (102) rrf m-t r smn pwy n sfn.n f bf mr n dqr.n f r n r st \"Would he act75 in such a way to rectify the end for whom he has tormented, his heart being pained for whom he had fixed to live in a foreign country?\" ( Sinuhe 162) (103) w tysn mr nf r-qr sp -sn \"And their (gods) hearts were pained for him (Bata) greatly.\" ( LES 19, 6) (104) w ty n pr - .w.s mr nf r-qr sp sn \"And the heart of the Pharaoh lph was pained for him (Bata) greatly.\" ( LES 26, 6) (105) wn.nsn mr r b n mf 72 Alternatively it can be analyzed as w\u00f8 mr(.w) rmm s w, \"it is painful, the way she mourns you.\" Vernus 2014, 277. 73 pEbers 44, 5 74 pHearst 4, 2. 75 The verb form here is, indicated by the germination, an emphatic smf 61 \"They were painful onto heart.\" (Kamose stela = tCarnarvon I rto. 7)76 In the first four examples, the heart is the subject, and the possessor of the heart is the experiencer; the dative expresses the stimulus.77 In (101), mr is in prospective form in parallel with s in the subsequent clause. The context suggests that mr here expresses something quite tender and int imate, suggestive of maternal love: the (dead) king (=stimulus) has just arrived to the abode of the gods, and to the mother goddess (=experiencer),78 he is like a premature baby,79 and she wants to make sure that he gets fed. In (102), mr is stative with bf as the subject . (103) and (104) come from a Late Egyptian story, where ty instead of b is used, but mr occurs in the same stative form, like in (102). These examples will be considered further in Chapter 4. (105) is a bit of anomaly. If we were to translate strictly based on the grammar, taking mr as stative with sn as the antecedent, it would yield, \"the y were in the state of pain on account of his majesty's heart.\" But the narrative context requires that sn be the stimulus and mf, the experiencer. In \"proper\" Middle Egyptian, what is expected following the auxiliary verb wn.in is an adjectival nfr sw construction.80 Some of the later attestations of mr occur in syntactic environments that are characteristic of the Late Egyptian. In (106), mr is the adjectival predicate of the clause preceded by a non - enclitic particle p-wn.81 In (107), the stative of mr is used as the complement of the auxiliary 76 There are two Kamose stelae. The text on the Carnarvon tablet contains parallel lines from Kamose stela I. For transcription of Kamose texts, Helck 1983, 82 -97. 77 In addition to the examples considered here, refer to the attestations in the CT as cited in Nyord 2009, 92 n. 526. 78 Variously referred to as \"the lady of Dep,\" \"Bastet,\" or \"she of the midst of Nekheb\" is the same spell. 79 Suggested by the verse immediate following it, wh ich says: s .t m nk nw hrw k, \"'my son,' she says, 'take my this breast and suck it,' she says, 'since you have not come to the (full) number of your days.'\" 80 E.g., wn. n nfr st hr bf r... \"it was more beautiful upon his heart than...\" attested in Peasant B2 131 -132 and Kagemni II, 6-7. 81 Usually, p-wn is followed by the subject + adverbial (first present) construction. Junge 2005, 87. 62 verb pr, stacked after another stative sr.k[w ].82 In (108) (a), mr is adverbial predicate with sw as its subject experi encer. Note this sw is not the 3ms dependent pronoun, but the 3ms proclitic pronoun of the First Present,83 which, in a different manuscript of the same text has the variant wf, as seen in (b). In (109), mr seems to be analyzed by the scribe as an infinitive of r+infinit ive construction. That mr is not elsewhere attested in r + infinitive construction makes it likely that this is an instance of hypercorrection, which was rather common in Late Egyptian.84 In (110), mr is an adverbial predicate of a circumstantial clause, and its subject, suffix pronoun w, refers to the whole clause serving as the object of m-r. (106) p-wn mr p rt ww \"...because the career of a soldier is painful .\" (pChester Beatty V rto. 5, 9 -14) (107) r wn r bk m t nw.t mt w r pr sr.k[w ] mr.kw \"When I was working in the Maat barn, I became bedridden, being ill.\" (HO pl.

The stacking of the stative of sr and mr is attested also in the Two Brothers 4, 8 (= LES 13, 14 -15). 83 Junge 2005, 112 -113. In Loprieno et al. 2019, they are referred to as pronominal \"preformatives.\" 84 Junge 2005, 112. On the nature of the quality of writing of the particular text from which this example is drawn, see Gardiner 1928, 8 -9. Gardiner does not single out this example, he makes a general note of \"the extreme inaccuracy of the text, its superfluous additions and its unaccountable omissions.\" 63 Two points regarding the ways in diachronic changes in syntax may affect the meaning of mr. First, in earlier Egyptian, the status of mr as either adjectival or verbal (including stative) readily decides the semantic role of the argument, as either experiencer or stimulus/theme. In Late Egyptian, however, where everything becomes adverbial, the semantic role has to be decided from the context. Second, while the change of syntax in itself does not affect the meaning of the word directly, the attestations of mr in the texts written in lower registers (genres other than literary texts and monumenta l inscriptions) allow us to witness the pain situations that are not attested in the earlier texts (or the textds written in higher registers whose syntax, more or less, adheres to that of the Middle Egyptian). This in turn has the effect of \"broadening\" t he semantic range of mr. The substantive mr is written the same way as the predicative mr. In magico -medical texts, especially in medical verdicts, mr stands for a specific medical condition in question, be it a trauma, a gastric disease, a tumor, etc.85 Outside magico -medical text, it is used as a general term for pain as in (114).86 (111) mr ry \"Pain/illness I will treat.\" (pEdwin Smith 1, 2) (112) mr \"Pain/illness I will contend.\" (pEdwin Smith 2, 6) (113) mr n rw ny \"Pain/illness not to be treated.\" (pEdwin Smith 2, 15) (114) wn.n sty pn w wrt n mr n ryt rf \"Then the peasant wept very greatly because of the pain of what was done against him.\" (Peasant B55-56) 85 See Breasted 1930, 45 -47; MedWb 380. 86 The distinction between pain and illness seems not so meaningful in Egyptian context. MedWb 378 gives Krankheit and qualifies by adding a note \"Wohl stets mit dem Begriff 'schmerzend' verbunden zu denken.\" 64 The feminine mrt also designates pain, illness and disease in magico -medical texts, and to an extent, mrt seems interchangeable with mr.87 Outside the medical verdict formula, mrt is far more common than mr. (115) kt nt mrt m gs-tp \"Another for pain of half -head (=migraine).\" (pEbers 47, 14) (116) dr mrt prt m - pnd \"Driving away a disease/pain which is caused by a worm.\" (pEbers 20, 23 -21, 1) (117) kt 6 nwt rt.n st r r s{s} <f> r dr mrt myt tpf \"Another: the 6th of that which Isis made for Re himself to drive out the pain in his head.\" (pEbers 47, 5-6) In the PT, it is specifically used to refer to Seth's aggression and is customarily translated as \"evil.\" In a private letter dating from the late Old Kingdom, no Sethian aggression per se is mentioned, but the word is determined by the Seth determinative.88 (118) swt n m sn m - mrt nb(t) rt.n st rsn \"It is he who saved them from every evil that Seth did against the m.\" (PT 587) (119) y nn ry mrt rf n snf st \"Come to us, he against whom evil was done by his brother Seth...\" (PT 606) (120) n w mrt r wt r bt im n bkt tn snnwt \"Shall misfortune89 overcome (your) humble servant my fellow servant?\" (pBoulaq 8, 6) 2.3.8 nqm The word nqm appears almost exclusively in the \"magical\" context. As a one-place predicate, it has n ppy nfr -k-r... \"...and Neferkare will not let it be afflicted by virtue of the mouth of Pepi Neferkare...\" 87 Hence, MedWb treats them in a single entry; pEbers 247 and pHearst 75 are identical recipes, yet what is mrt in the former (pEbers 47,9) is mr (pHearst 6,1) in the latter. 88 Cf. Baer 1966, 2 n.3. The Seth determinative for mr is also known from a letter to the dead (Qaw Bowl, 3), a coffin (Outer coffin of Sepi, ll.119.311), and Anthes 1928, 31. 89 Following Baer 1966, n. n who specifically notes that the literal meaning of \"pain, sickness\" does not suit the context. 90 In Metternich stela (l. 6), nqm is contrasted with rw, \"rejoice.\" Gardiner 1930, 21. 65 (PT 684) (122) m nn () nqmf n nqmt nbt \"As for everything that is and was there - I will not allow him be afflicted of any affliction ...\" (Chicago Letter to the Dead OIM 13945, 2) (123) mk grt maidservants who make Seni afflicted ...\" (Chicago Letter to the Dead OIM 13945, 5) (124) nn prk nqmk srwk nn n sk \"you will not exist, you will be afflicted , should you go to sleep, you will not awaken.\" (Bremner Rhind 30, 26) m n irty=fy... \"You shall flow out, undead, one who afflicts the temple, one who shuts the eye, one who enfeebles the side (of the body) ...do not afflict the temple of the NN born of NN, do not shut his two eyes...\" (pBudapest 51.1961, Spell 3)91 In (121) -(123) the subjunctive form of nqm is used as the object of th e verb rdi. In (121), which is the continuation of the same PT spell in (95),92 nqmf is to be understood as parallel in meaning to mrf, hence , the referent of f appears to be the same smk. (122) and (123) both come from the Chicago letter to the dead,93 where nqm is determined by the Seth determinative (C7), instead of the usual evil bird.94 Notice in (122), the cognate substantive nqmt is added for intensification.95 In (123), nqm is in bound construction with both a perfective active participle rdyt96 and proper noun sn. And it is the latter which expresses the subject of the subjunctive and 91 K\u00e1kosy 1981. 92 The determinative used here is the hair determinative. In addition to the determinative, because the word frequently occurs in association with the body part sm, \"temple,\" it is frequently translated as \"to be bald.\" Nevertheless, nqm here parallels with mr and unless there is further positive evidence to link nqm with baldness, it seems more reasonable to take the meaning of the word as roughly synonymous with mr. Cf. Gardiner 1930, 21. 93 Gardiner 1930, 19 -22; Wente 1990, 213. 94 See Gardiner 1930, 21 and plate X, photo I&II. 95 Cf. Loprieno 1995, 89. 96 Gardiner (1930, 22) notes that writing out y in the perfective active participle is unusual, and in this case, it might have to do here with the dual. 66 the experiencer of the predicate. (124) is an incantation uttered against a hostile entity; nqmk is a prospective smf where k is the subject experience r. The substantive nqmt , \"affliction,\" is not widely attested. In addition to (42) and (122), it occurs once more in the same Chicago letter do the dead seen in (126). Notice how nqmt serves as the object of the verb dr, \"to drive away.\" (126) .dr n( ) nqmt nbt ntt r mt () \"Drive away for me all affliction which is against my wife...\" (Chicago Letter to the Dead OIM 13945, 6) 2.3.9 yt The lexeme yt been already encountered in examples (21) and (87). For determinatives, it frequently has G37 stacked with Aa2 ,97 although sometimes only Aa2 is used. It is similar to mr/mrt and h in that it is used as a general term for disease or illness, and that it is attested across various genres of texts. But unlike the other terms, it is not attested as a verb . (127) kt w t dr yt m t nt s \"Another for emptying out the belly and driving out the disease in the belly of a man.\" (pEbers 8, myt-t \"What you find is that this illness of his stayed like before...\" (pEbers 41, 1) (129) sr r sp w m yt nn kkt-nt-sryt \"...who sleeps through the night until dawn, free from illness and witho ut hacking cough.\" (pWestcar 7, 18-19) (130) yt pw gr r s mt \"It is a disease , namely, the silence against what been 8, 2)98 97 pustule determinative.

The Wb. has two separate entries, swn (with a wn hare; IV, 68.14) and snw (with a nw pot; III, 428.1 -3), which is cross -referenced to the former. For both, it gives leiden, \"to suffer\" as definition. Faulkner treats the two under one entry where snw is given as a variation of swn. Unlike the Wb., Faulkner gives \"to perish\" as the definition. The attestations of snw are all in the Pyramid Text. While both \"to suffer\" and \"to perish\" seem possible, in light of the fact that its negation is paralleled by n tm \"not be destroyed\" in (136) or n \"endure\" in (137), \"to perish\" sounds like a more fitting choice. (134) b.n n k r tk n r.nf snwk \"Horus has gathered all your limbs for you, for he could not let you suffer/perish .\" (PT 364) (135) n r.n rw snwk \"Horus cannot let you suffer/perish .\" (PT (136) n tm qs k n snw wfk NN n wt s w m nr. \"Your bones will not be destroyed, your flesh will not suffer/perish , NN, your limbs will not be far from you, for you are one of the gods.\" (PT 412) (137) n NN pn n .t n swnw ppy pn t last perpetually. This Pepi will not suffer/perish ever.\" (PT 469) Outside the PT, only swn is attested. In CT, it occurs without a determinative, in a very obscure context. (138) iw rri sn in swnsn sk wi swn.k(w) \"The pig has passed by. Is it when I suffer that they will suffer ?\" (CT II 118, c -e). It is also known from Ipuwer where it occurs in the r+infinitive construction. Here, too, both 68 \"perish\" and \"suffer\" seem to work. (139) w ms srw qrw r swn \"Oh, the starved officials are perishing/suffering 5, 2) (140) ns pr.yw w{.t} r \"commoners who come and go99 are perishing/suffering .\" (Ipuwer 5, 4) Additionally, Fisher -Elfert has suggested that swn in Ipuwer is more appropriately translated as \"to be homeless,\" based on the following passage where the substantive swny is contrasted with nb dm \"the owner of mn swny m nb dm \"He causes him to land, one had no (successful) landing; one who was homeless(?) is (now) the owner of domains.\" ( Man for Son 4, 8) Substantive swnyt is attested once, in a medical incantation, where it is paralleled by mrt. It was first translated by Erm ans as das Leiden,101 and it is possible that all the subsequent translations of swn as \"to suffer\" could have originated from here. (142) dr mrt mt wk swnyt mt tk \"I will drive off the illness which is your body, pain which is in your limbs.\" (pBerlin 3027 3, 2) When we turn to what seems to be the s -causative, sswn , the Wb again gives two entries. The first sswn, which is written with a wn flower with no determina tive, is simply glossed as a verb in relation to the water of eye, whose sole attestation is the PT spell below. (143) sswn the eye of Horus, the waters of which he (Seth) has caused to suffer .\" (PT 144) The second sswn is written with a wn bunny and determined by the evil bird. The Wb. gives the translation bestrafen, \"to punish,\"102 but TLA additionally gives zerstoren, \"to destroy\" and 99 On the use of this phrase, Enmarch 2008, 112. 100 Enmarch (2008, 104) suggests a possible pun in Ipuwer 5, 2 with the root swn, \"to exchange, sell.\" 101 Erman 1901, 19. He has a question mark next to it though. 102 Cf. Gardiner 1909, 41, who sees the term employed in \"chastisement\" of enemies. 69 leiden lassen, \"to let suffer.\" If we recall that that the English wo rd \"pain\" originally meant payment or penalty, i.e. , suffering inflicted as punishment for an offense, the association between \"to punish\" and \"to let suffer\" seems quite plausible. Below are some examples. (144) r dr st - influence of the god, gods...to destroy/punish/let suffer the enemy (i.e. the disease -causing demon), the chief of those who cause disturbances to enter into this my flesh...\" (pEbers 1, 3-6) (145) r sswn t swt r dr bs n st \"to destroy/punish/let suffer the rebellion throughout the foreign lands, to drive out the influence from the foreign region.\" ( Urk.

It is attested once in Ptahhotep , in a genitive construction with rswt \"dream,\" which has been subject to many different interpretations.104 A compound expression sswn b occurs twice in Ipuwer , which has been suggested as conveying mk sswn rswt pw bs.(w) rs \"Look, it is a destruction of dream . It ought to be covered over.\" ( Ptahhotep D359 nf sswn b pw \"It is doing it wrongly; it is destruction of heart .\" (Ipuwer 11, 5) 103 sswn sometimes is followed by the fire determinative. For instance, t mt tp k sswn s st \"my uraeus which is on you, it destroys them.\" ( Urk IV, 613, 15 = Poetic Stela 9) 104 For instance, Parkinson (1997, 258) renders it \"look, gossip is a self -destructive dream, at which one covers the face,\" while Allen (2015, 199) gives \"look, it is a nightmare (lit. a dream's causing pai n) that ought to be covered over.\" 105 Enmarch 2008, 175. 106 Version L1 (f, 2 -4) has w msk m [sp] n rswt sswn s pw t[w] rs \"Gossip is like a case of dream; it means it dissolves. Beware of it.\" Version L2 (6, 3 -4) w msk m sp n [rswt] sswn s pw tw rs 70 (150) n .n.tw n {}<k>107 m w d{yw} r s s[swn] b pw \"one does not call to you, free of aggression against it, it is destruction of heart .\" (Ipuwer 12, 6 -7) 2.3.11 snn The next item snn does not have many attestations. As a one -place predicate which selects a subject experiencer, it seems to mean \"to suffer.\" The W\u00f6rterbuch cross -references it to swn, and its occurrence in a CT spell is indeed reminiscent snw in the PT. (151) n tmt wt n snnw [...] \"your limbs haven't perished, your [...] have not suffered.\" (CT I 81, l) Other known occurrences are from the literary l aments. The construction in (152 ) is rather unusual.108 Whether the 1cs dependent pronoun is analyzed as a subject or object, it expresses the experiencer. And in this particular example, b is not simply a body part of the experiencer, but the enti ty responsible for pain. In (153 ), nsn is ethical dative, which doesn't count as a core argument; pswt, the subject experience r, is the only argument. In (154 ), snn is stative, and its antecedent, f, is the experiencer. (152) snn w r b wdw sw p t rf \"I'm suffering because of my heart. It is painful to hide my innermost because of it.\" (Khakhperreseneb rto. 13) (153) tw.tw wt f snn \"The road is netted, while he stands suffering .\" (Ipuwer 13, 5) 107 For the emendation, Enmarch 2008, 186. 108 Gardiner (1909, 104) notes that w must be the subject, just as sw is the subject of wdw. Cf. Vernus 1994, 329 - 32. Being followed by a dependent pronoun, it may seem like a participle used as an adjectival predicate, but the morphology here suggests that it's an imperfective participle. Only perfective participles are known to predicates. GEG \u00a7374; Allen 2010, 336; Loprieno et al. 2019, 651. Also, only the second and third -person dependent pronouns are known to be used as a subject, for the adjectival predicative use of participle, at least in Middle Egyptian. Allen 2010 , 71. In the first person, the nominal sentence with the independent pronoun nk is mostly used. Loprieno et al. 2019, 654 -655. 71 2.3.12 n The word ni is often determined by the evil bird, but sometimes by the man striking with stick (A24) or the hand to mouth determinative (A2). The use of the latter could be a result of the confusion with its homonyms ni \"to inquire\"109 or \"to conjure\"110 which are also determined by A2.111 As a two -place predicate, ni selects the body part as the second argument (patient), similar to mn. In (155), ni is used in the r + infinitive construction, followed by the body part. (155) nr [bn] tw i r nt112 rd.wy w r mt r pwy.t m -dtn \"Had I not been suffering in my feet, I would go to jump with you.\" ( LES 4, 9-10) To an extent, ni overlap s in meaning with mn. What we saw in (72) with mn in reference to Redjedet's labor pain, elsewhere in the same text, ni is used. (156) w m nn hrw pr wn. n rd-dt r nts qsn mss s \"One of these days, it happened that Redjedet was suffering , her giving birth being difficult.\" (pWestcar 9, 21 -22) To cite a few more attestations of n in reference to labor pain,113 (157) comes from Hatsheptsut's divine birth cycle at Deir el -Bahri. (158) and (159) are part of spells for a woman in labor. Whereas in (158 ), the stative form is used, (159) uses the r + infinitive form like (156 ). (157) (title of the queen ( Urk IV, 226, 4) (158) d-mdw sp 4 r nm n sn w r wpt nt st -mt nty r ms(.t) n.t \"Recited 4 times over a dwarf of clay, which is placed on the vertex of a woman giving birth, while suffering .\" (pLeiden I 348 vso. 12, 6) 109 Wb. IV, 495.8 lemma -no. 155500. 111 Actually, these cases are ambiguous. In pEbers 48, 3 & 59, 11, for instance, ni could mean \"to inquire,\" rather than \"to suffer.\" Also, a case in the doomed prince, it has been suggested the word could mean \"to conjure\" instead of \"to suffer.\" 112 Here, ins tead of the usual G37, A2 is used for the determinative. 113 Cf. The pain of childbirth ( mr msw ) is an ailment mentioned in the Oracular Amuletic Decree (Edwards 1960, rt. 116), where the gods promise: wn ds tr m(w)t nb r mr nb msw , \"we shall keep her safe from any death and any pain in giving birth.\" 72 (159) d.tw r' pn sp [...] [...] tp n st -mt nty r nts \"This saying be recited [...] times over leaves of the [...] tree, placed on the head of the woman who is suffering.\" (pLeiden I 348, vso. 12, 9) The heart, ty, is the body part that is most frequently collocated with ni. Literally, \"to suffer in heart\", it is comparable to mr + b/ ty. It is often translated idiomatically as \"to have pity\" or bw-pw dt ntt tyt \"I did not abandon. I did not cause you to suffer in you heart .\" (pLeiden 371, 9 -10) (161) w pyf sn r nt tyf r-qr sp sn \"And his big brother suffered pain in his heart greatly.\" ( LES 17, 4) (162) wn.ns r nt tyst nf r-qr sp sn \"Then she suffered pain in her heart greatly.\" ( LES 49, 8) ni can also select a generic illness or pain as the second argument. (163) bw-pw dt nt[t] mr .r nbt m -dt m s r n nb \"I did not cause you to suffer pain (from) anything I did with you in the manner of a master.\" (pLeiden 371, 18 -19) In addition, s omething more abstract, such as speech, can be selected as the second argument. (164) w tw r nt n p ns r-qr sp sn \"And one (pharaoh) suffered very much at what she said, the heart of pharaoh, lph.\" ( LES 26, 6) (165) .n p-r-r-ty (r) n{n}[t] t wb.yt .d.yt n f \"Then Pre -horakhty suffered on the account of the reply that was said to him.\" ( LES 3, 10) (166) mk sr m wnn m nw w nb stp \"Look my condition is like someone who is in pain , all my limbs being dismembered...\" (Sphinx stela of Thutmose IV = Urk IV, -717a. See also the note on the passage (161) in Gardiner and Sethe 1927, 23 -24. 115 Cf. an incantation for an amulet for migraine from the magico -medical papyrus dated to the Third Intermediate Period (pBoulaq 6, 3 and 8): ky r <n> m t nt nn gs-m, \"another spell for an amulet for pain of the head (in) the half of the temple.\" 73 Like mr, qsn is a lexeme with an adjectival root and is used in a wide range of contexts to describe a quality of an action or situation. It is customarily translated as \"to be difficult, painful, arduous\" etc. In (167) -(170), qsn occurs in w + \u00f8 + stative + rf construction,116 where the experiencer is expressed by the dative. (167) sf wrt nr p(w) w qsn rs \"This herdsman delivers greatly (well?); it is painful f or her.\" (Tomb of Watetkhethor, Room B1, West Wall, third register)117 (168) w qsn r r-qd r-ntt dns tw r \"It is entirely difficult for me, because you are heavier than I.\" (pKahun VI.12 x+2, 5)118 qsn rf \"It doesn't occur for looking at his belly; it's painful for him.\" (pEbers 51, 21 -22) (170) w qsn rf wn r f \"It is painful for him to open his mouth...\" (pEdwin Smith 3, 3)119 (171) w qsn r rt nn w.k(w) wrt \"It is difficult to do this while I am completely alone.\" (Tomb of Ankhmahor, East Wall, middle Register)120 As the subject is not expressed, in cases like (167) and (168), the stimulus has to be supplied by the context. (168) is a caption to the Old Kingdom tomb painting of a cow delivering a calf, so whatever the cow is experiencing is the stimulus ; (169) is Horus' grievance when subjected to a sexual aggression by Seth, so whatever Horus had experience d is the stimulus . In the instruction for making medical diagnosis, such as in (170) and (171), the movement that produces pain in the patient is specified in the accompanying clauses. (172) is different from the rest. The 116 Omission of subject is particularly frequent with adjective verbs. See Vernus 2014, 288 -290. 117 Kanawati and Abder -Raziq 2008. 118 Collier and Quirke 2004. 119 Identical or similar phrases occur in 6, 5 -6; 7, 3 -4; 7, 16; 8, 7 -8. 120 Kanawati and Hassan 1997. 74 experiencer in this case is encoded as a part of the stative, in its 1cs ending. What comes after r, rt nn, is the theme. Far less commonly, qsn occurs in a finite smf construction. We have already seen in the examples (72) and (156) where qsn serves as a verbal predicate of the nominal msss.121 The following examples display the same pattern, where rrt and m serve as the subject. (172) mt qsn rrt m nw r t nbt \"Look, what is being done in the Residence is more painful than anything.\" (pUCL 32200, 5 -f \"You shall tell him, 'look at your shoulders and your breast.' When he does, looking done by him122 is painful .\" (pEdwin Smith 10, 10) It is also used as adjectives as in the example below.123 (174) qsn.wy wt wty mw road ( Kanais Inscription Text B, 2) (175) kt rrt qsnt \"another treatment against the painful 95,19) (176) prt n s m mr qsn \"a recipe for a man in a painfu l illness.\" (pBerlin 3038 167) The exclamatory use of qsn in (174) is comparable to that of mr in (91). As will be examined shortly below, a road is one of the most common entities to which the quality of qsn is attributed. In (175) and (176), qsn is attributed to the substantive mr or mrt. Whether there is any sem antic difference, for instance, with yt mrt (pBerli n 3038 172), cannot be decided here. To an extent, 121 It should be noted, however, that verbal constructions of adjective verbs are not clearly distinguishable from adjectival sentence s unless the latter employ pronominal subjects (dependent pronouns) or the dual, exclamatory - wy ending. For instance, TLA analyzes qsn in (72) and (156) as an adjective while Loprieno et al. (2019, 663) analyzes as a smf. 122 For the translation of the ph rase pr m-f, see Breasted 1930, 320. Breasted's translation makes a more sense than the one in Loprieno et al. 2019, 731, where pr is analyzed as a subjunctive and translated as \"it is difficult to see whether (anything) happens as a result.\" 123 Loprien o et al. 2019, 663 -664. 75 however, the meaning of qsn seems to be interchangeable with mr. For instance, one manuscript of Ptahhotep uses qsn in place of mr for the same verse encountered in example (21). (177) yt pw qsnt nt btw \"it is a painful disease of the btw serpent.\" ( Ptahhotep D301) The quality of qsn is with nm \"pleasant, sweet.\" For instance, s imilar to the diagnostic tests seen in (169) or (173), another diagnostic test in pEdwin Smith uses n nm instead of qsn. (178) n nm.n n f dgf n qbtf \"It is not pleasant for him to look at his breast.\" (pEdwin Smith 1,26) In M iddle Kingdom and New Kingdom autobiographical texts, the phrase snm qsnt (or similar) occurs in a chain of self -laudatory epithets of the deceased. (179) is one such example among many.124 In view of the fact that this particular example occurs in the section specifically devoted to the deceased's way with speech ( mdt, s, rw), the epithet seems to be referring to an ability to defuse tension or relieve a difficult situation with eloquenc e.125 (179) sr mdt r nw kr qsnt .w nb f r rw[f] \"one who lifted up the word to the interior of the shrine, who found (the right) phrase, who made pleasant what is painful , whose voice his lord CG case one is wondering what reliving pain with eloquence looks like, a passage from a Middle Kingdom literary text gives an idea. In (180), the participle snm refers to the ba, who, by posing a rhetorical question with the expected answer of \"no,\" tries to cajole the ir owner into thinking death is not painful. (180) snm n mnt n w qsnt pw \"Who sweetens the West for me (by saying) 'is it something painful ?'\" (Man and Ba 19- 2) 124 Cf. Stela of Sehetepibre = CG 20538 rto. 10 -11; Tomb of Djefaihapi (Siut I), Great hall, east wall, south half, 248; The autobiography of Rekhmire, Urk IV, 1082, 1. Also, a similar phrase nk s ws snm hw, \"I am one who raised the fallen, who made pleasant (for) the sufferer,\" in a Ramesside stela of Bak -aa (K RI II, 386, 388). 125 Mentuhotep's inscription is particularly rich in the epithets relating to eloquence. See Doxey 1998. 76 As seen in (174), the condition of a road is frequently attributed with the quality of qsn. In (181), which comes from the same inscription as (174), Seti I presents himself the snm par excellence : having excavating a well, he has managed to snm the road that had been qsn since time immemorial. In (182), the same theme is picked up by Seti's successor. The narrative of Ramses II's excavation of the well is made all the more dramatic when the condition of the road is given a heavy emphasis. (183) and (184) relate the mountainous terrain characteristic of Syro -Palestine geography. In addition to the lack of water, it is the vulnerability to ambush attacks that made the roads in these regions qsn for the Egyptians.126 (181) r nr nswyt \"since gods (= primeval times) the road was painful , (but) is made pleasant during my reign.\" (Kanais Inscrirption Text B, 7)127 (182) w r wts r mw r rk nr \"There is a lot of gold in the foreign country of Iket, but her way is very painful because of (lack of) water....it has been in this painful condition because of water since the time of the gods .\" (Quban stela of Ramses II, year 3, line 9&20 bw nty ry qsn m- ww \"...the place where he is lacks in water, is hidden in the trees, and many are its roads made painful by the mountains.\" ( Merikare E91-92) (184) ssn mountains and painful bottlenecks.\" ( First Hittite Marriage Inscription, Abu Simbel, 34)129 Another feature worth mentioning is qsn's collocation with b. In (185), qsn is used as an attributive adjective modifying sp, and together, they serve as the subject of r b nr; the whole 126 Cf. A passage from a Ramesside literary text reads: t gwt-wt n.t m sw kp.w n bt, \"the bottleneck is endangered by Shasu Bedouins hidden under the bushes.\" 127 KRI I, Karnak wall stela line 27. 77 clause in turn serves as the second member of the bipartite nominal sentence. In (186), qsn is a predicative adjective with nn as its subject, which refers forward to sqr smsm . As with other pain words that are collocated with the heart words, the possessor of the heart corresponds to the experiencer. The focus, however, is laid on the thing causing the pain (stimulus) than on the experiencer, com parable to usage of mr in (105). (185) r r nsw nb nty r pr snn.tf srw nb...sp qsn r b nr \"as for any future king who will destroy all my plans...a deed painful on the heart of the gods.\" (Kanais Inscription Text C, 11 -12) (186) n...qsn.w(y) b sqr smsm r bt nb r.nk \"As long as I live...this is more painful on my heart, (namely) starving of my horses, than any crime you committed.\" (Piye stela 65 -66) Substantive qsnt occurs frequently in the Upper Egyptian autobiographical stele dated to the First Intermediate Period. References to famine are common in these inscriptions,130 and among the deeds the deceased boasts is how he stave d off famine during the years of qsnt. (187) w sn.n() nrty(?)131 rnpwt qsnt \"I kept Gebelein alive in the years of hardship ...\" (Stela of Iti of Gebelein, 2 -3) (188) w .n() pr mn rnpt qsnt... \"I supplied the house of Amun during the years of hardship ...\" (Stela of Rehui of Qurna, 3)132 (189) w .n() sn n nwt tn m qd m sb nr f m rnpwt qsnt... \"I measured out Upper Egyptian barley as sustenance (keeping -alive) for this whole town in the gateway of the Count and Chief Priest Djefi, in the years of hardship ...\" (Stela of Senni, 2 -5)133 It seems that the word qsnt acquired a specific association with the shortage of food from this widespread of use in the First Intermediate Period inscriptions.134 The First Intermediate Period 130 Vandier 1936; Bell 1971. The famine during the First Intermediate Period is most vividly described in the inscriptions of Ankhtify from Mo'alla. See Vandier 1950. 131 Written w-m-trw. 133 Cf. CG20502 and CG 20503. 134 Vandier 1936, 61. 78 is often referred to as the \"dark age,\" during which Egypt is thought to have suffered from famines and low floods.135 The memory of the First Intermediate Period is thought to have played a significant role in shaping the pat terns of cultural representation throughout the rest of the pharaonic history.136 In a passage from Neferti , the text that was long regarded by Egyptologists as being inspired by the disorder of the First Intermediate Period, but is now thought to be of muc h later production (the Second Intermediate Period or early 18th dynasty),137 qsnt is attributed to the foraging of the Syrians.138 In a royal inscription from the Ramesside period, qsnt occurs in reference to a drought in the land of Hatti. (190) bw-nfr nb rww pt.w fw s.tw t-w-t \"All good things are gone, thrown down to the ground because of the famine (caused) by those foraging of the Syrians who roam the land.\" ( Neferti 32) (191) r-r m-t m.tst -qn... \"After this, they realized their land is in this condition of famine ...The great chief of Hatti said...'our lord Seth is an gry with us; the heaven does not give water to us...\" (First Hittite Marriage Inscription, Abu Simbel, 30 -31) 2.4 Summary and Discussion 2.4.1 Determinatives The Egyptian pain words are predominantly determined by the bad bird determinative, G37. The range of words determined by G37 is very wide \u2014from something seemingly value - neutral words such as r \"to be small,\" or sgnn \"to anoint, to soften\" to words signifying evil such as bn, w, sft. Supposing we accept Goldwasser's classifier theory and see G37 as 135 Cf. Hassan 1997 & 2007. 136 Cf. Assmann 2002 [1996], 81 -114. See also E. Morris 2020. 137 See Chapter 5. 138 See also Neferti 18-19 where the disruption in agricultural activities by the Asiastics is described. 139 The grammar is rather erratic in these inscriptions. The Amarat -West and Karnak versions of the same passage, for instance, has only one n for the negative. 79 representing a conceptual category,140 what kind of conceptual relations can be posed between the pain words and other words that are determined by G37? Arlett David's 2000 work is a lexicographic study of G37, influenced by Goldwasser's classifier theory.141 She broadly categorizes all the terms determined by G37 collected from Worterbuch and Faulkner into two distinct semantic conceptual categories.142 Under the first category, the words associated with the concept of \"inferiority\" are placed. The words in this category are further divided into various subcategories, such as the concept of pain and suffering,143 concept of smallness and youth, concept of death, concept of stupidity, etc.144 The second category represents the concept of \"perturbation.\" Again, the words are divided to subcatego ry. The biggest subcategory is that of the concept of evil, under which 29 words are included. Other subcotegories are smaller, with no more than nine words, and about half of them only have one word.145 David posits the words ns and bn as the most prot otypical members of each group. For David, that words in these two categories share the same determinative is contingent on the accidents of history.146 Her argument is based on the evidence from the Old Kingdom and First Intermediate Period. G37 is first a ttested in the Fourth dynasty, as a logogram for ns \"be small\" in the sense of \"young\" or with diminutive meaning; later during the Old Kingdom, by the process of metaphorical association, G37 came to represent an abstract category of inferiority. 140 On the clas sifer theory, see below in the Excursus A. 141 See, for instance, Goldwasser's preface to the work in David 2000, vii -ix; 32 -33; 56 -57; 75 -76. 142 David 2000, 3. Additionally, she posits a third group, where the terms can potentially evoke positive ideas. 143 This constitute the biggest subgroup (\"douleur, souffrance, As expected, some of the words in this subgroup appears in other subgroups. Under \"maladie\" reappears hw, mn(t) and mr; under \"mis\u00e8re, besoin\" appears mr, snw and nw, which are related to (inflection -wise?) mr, snnw and n. 144 David 2000, 6 -7, table 1. 145 David 2000, 7 -8, table 2. 146 David 2000, 17 -18; 31; 39ff. 80 The wor ds determined by G37 at this stage are better thought of as the marked counterpart of the unmarked concept of the same category (small, negative, plural vs . big, positive, singular). Differently put, the concept of inferiority that G37 carried during this time was relational and was not associated with the notion of absolute bad. It is only in the course of the First Intermediate Period, the concept of evil ( bn) emerged, as a type of inferiority \u2014moral inferiority, in particular. From this period and onward, words associated with this extended sense started being determined by G37. As David subsumes pain under the first category instead of the second categor y, one of the implications made is that in the Egyptian system of thought, pain has more to do with the concept of inferiority than the concept of perturbation (it is closer to ns than to bn). Many of the examples seen in this chapter, however, indicate that pain is closely related to the notion of perturbation as well. As early as in the PT, references to pain occur in the context of Seth's aggression, the epitome of wrongdoing. Not only that, some of the pain words are occasionally determined by the S eth animal C7+S12, the determinative intimately associated the idea of the disruption of the normal order, i.e. , perturbation.147 While I am not advocating here that the pain words should be moved to the second category, it is still worth pointing out that David's study does not provide any positive Egyptian evidence that justifies categorizing pain concept and pain words under the first group rather than the second. Winand points out, \"[w]hen entering into the detail of verbal semantics, the system of class ifiers does not actually add much to the information, but it can nevertheless help to confirm some results.\"148 I subscribe to a similar view. Looking at the system of determinatives does not 147 For instance, h is once attested with the Seth animal determinative in pEdiwn Smith (17, 13). Words like in, mr, nqm and yt, too, can be followed by the Seth animal determinative. See te Velde 1967, 22 -23. 148 Winand 2016, 136. 81 lead to a fine -grained understanding of the meaning of the pain w ords. One takeaway from David's study is the insight the words determined by G37 as having historically constructed relations. Ins tead of saying G37 represents a cognitive category, we could think of in terms of how the long tradition of using the same G37 for pain words and for words like ns and bn would have created a tendency in the users to more readily associate pain with ns and bn than with words determined by other determinatives. 2.4.2 Physical Pain and Emotional Suffering Previous studies had already suggested that the Egyptian language does not sharply differentiate between physical pain and emotional suffering, one study even raising the possibility that the Egyptians viewed emotiona l pain and grief as a variant of physical pain.149The lexicographical survey in this chapter indeed showed that several key pain words (ih, mn, mr and qsn) in the Egyptian lexicon can be used both for different kind of pain situations across different genre s of texts. What can we infer from this apparent lexical distintion between physical pain and emotional suffering? Before we can say anything conclusive, it is pe rhaps worth asking to ourselves: how is that we are able to distinguish these instances in the first place, if there is no lexical distinction in Egyptian? The answer lies in our ability to draw inferences from the context. For instance, when a formula such as s r mn + body part (or condition), \"a man who is pained in/suffers from...\" occurs in the magico -medical texts, we understand it as referring to physical pain. When an expression such as b/ty + pain + dative occurs in literary texts, since b and ty are be 149 See Excursus A below. 82 translated into English as heart/mind, the common tendency is to conceive of the e xpereince in terms of emotional suffering .150 Now, interpreting different instances of pain according to our own categories is not altogether wrong; to a great extent, it is inevitable, since the scholarly descriptive language very much depends on these ca tegories.151 Having said that, it is still important for scholars to strive to elucidate the meanings in a way that is consistent with the Egyptian worldview and cultural practices. The subsequent chapters will serve precisely that purpose. 150 According to Luraghi 2021, the majority of experiential verbs in Homeric Greek selects subject experiencer as the first argument (hence, nom inative alignment). The second argument (the stimulus) of these verbs, however, can be expressed in different cases of accusative, dative or genitive. Luraghi argues that construction variation is far from random. More specifically, she observes that NomAc c construction is connected with sight, volition, consciousness, awareness and attention, while the NomGen construction is connected with bodily needs and sensations, low awareness, and uncontrolled craving. The NomDat construction is restricted to the fie ld of emotions and encodes interactive situations, in which not only the experiencer, but often also the stimulus is a human being. It might be possible to think of b/ty + pain + dative in terms of this last NomDat construction in Homeric Greek. 151 Cf. Neumann and Thompson 2022, 2: \" Unfortunately, while a mind -body dualism is not applicable to all cultures, it is hard for modern scholars, particularly those who developed their disciplinary knowledge in Western contexts, to jettison it from our own descriptive language: we frequently refer to bodies, ideas, sensing versus perception. It is a dualism that much of our own written language structures and reinforces.\" 83 Excursus A: Lexicography of Pain and Emotions in Ancient Egyptian Lexicography has been central to Egyptology since the beginning of the field,152 and recent times, there has been a few works specifically devoted to theoreies and methods of lexicography .153 Even so, in light of the fact that research into a domain like pain is fairly new, it would be worthwhile to review some of the recent studies in lexicographical studies in pain and the related field of emotions so as to get a general sense of, among other s, how the particular challenges arising from the nature of these topics (subjectivity, cross -cultural variability, etc.) are currently being hand led in the field. On the topic of pain, there has not yet been a comprehensive lexicographical study. Arnette 's ongoing study on ancient Egyptian pain terminology and metaphors is mentioned by Prakash,154 where she is reported to have suggested an absence of a sharp distinction between physical and emotional pain in the ancient Egyptian lexicon. As it has not been published separately, not much can be said on it. O'Dell, in her PhD dissertation (2008) that surveys representations of various emotions in hieratic and demotic narrative and poetic papyri, devotes a few brief sections to the words relating to pain.155 She, too, argues for the lack of distinction between physical and emotional pain, but goes a step further by suggesting that the Egyptians viewed \"emotional pain, such as sorrow and grief as a variant of physical pain.\" She states that the absence of a clear boundary between physical and emotional pain in the Egyptian lexicon is comparable to the situation in archaic and classical Greek. She cites David Konstan who works on ancient Greek materials to 152 For the history of Ancient Egyptian lexicography, Polis (eds.) 2012. 154 Prakash 2020, 110. See Chapter 1 , n.34. 155 O'Dell 2008, 14 -15, 88 -90 and 19 6-199. 84 support her claim. According to Konstan 's reading of Aristotle, Aristotle did not include the concept of grief ( lup\u00ea, which also designated physical pain) under the label path\u00f4s (emotion) because Aristotle considered lup\u00ea as more elementary than other emotions (anger, pity, shame, etc.).156 Base d on this, Konstan suggests that the lack of lexical distinction between physical and emotional pain in ancient Greek \"may have been motivated by something more than a lexical accident... may itself be informative about the Greek view of sorrow as a sentimen t.\"157 As O'Dell 's work is one of the first works to broach the topic of pain in relations to emotions, her observation remains valuable. An article \"Pain Infliction, Inflictors and Healers in Egyptian Religious, Magical and Literary Perceptions\" by Joseph Amgad (2019) also needs to be mentioned. The ways in which the author divides various textual attestations first into the categories of psychological, physical, religious , and social, then further into the categories of pain feelings, inflictions , and hea ling, are confusing, as the author does not provide neither an explanation nor justification for th em. Nevertheless, the number of examples that are collected are commendable and are useful for doing further research. There have been a few lexicographical studies on Egyptian emotions. The study of emotions in Egyptology has almost exclusively been associated with the so -called classifier studies inaugurated by Goldwasser.158 Goldwasser argues that classifiers ( i.e., determinatives) constitute a system of ca tegories, which not only helps us understand the meaning of lexical units and phrases, but also Egyptian categories of thought. One of the categories she posits is a superordinate category of [ SENSES AND EMOTIONS ] represented by the hand to mouth 156 For Aristotle, for something to count as an emotion, it has to involve moral evaluations of human behavior. But as grief is shared by irrational animals, it did not occur to Aristotle that it is on par with other emotions. 157 Konstan 2006, 246 as quoted in O'Dell 2008, 198. 158 See, for instance, Goldwasser 2002 & 2005. 85 determina tive (A2). According to her, all the words determined by A2 are based on the non - linguistic, image -like notion159 that things are put in/come out from the body through the mouth. Emotions such as anger, jealousy and love are categorized into the same catego ry as eating and drinking because in Egyptain thought, emotions are conceptualized as something that resides in the container -like body, similar to the way eating and drinking is conceptualized as putting something into the container -like body. The existen ce of this cognitive -semantic category, then, is what has come to serve as the starting point for the Egyptological lexicography of emotions.160 Natalie (2017) draws on Goldwasser and proceeds from the understand ing that the figurative nature of hieroglyphic writing makes it possible to get to more fine -grained understanding of emotions as the Egyptians themselves conceived of them . She isolates the determinatives that are used to determine the Egyptian words for emotions of joy, sadness, fear and anger. She then categorizes all the known Egyptian words for each emotion by the determinatives. For each of these four emotions, she makes a distinction between the words that express an emotion vs words that describe how an emotion is felt . It is not entirely clear the criteria by which such a distinction is made, but there appears to be a certain pattern, as the expressions that involve the heart are consistently categorized under \"h ow it is felt\". Of the findings she presents , the emotion of joy displays greatest lexical richness, 159 This is called an image -schema according to cognitive linguistics, from which Goldwasser draws. Cognitive linguistics is explained further below. 160 Additi onally, the said lexicographical studies on emotions are framed as lexical semantics. In brief, lexi cal semantics approaches the meaning of a word by looking at the various relations that the word is caught in. It differs from compositional semantics in that instead of seeking an essential attribute of the thing that the word refers to, it seeks to go be yond individual words by referring to the ways in which words are related to syntactic structure. It is worth noting that lexical semantics itself is not a unified field and draws on different sub -branches of linguistics. See Geeraerts 2010 for an overview with an extensive bibliography of the main historical and contemporary trends of research in lexical semantics. On the relevance of lexical semantics to lexicography, see Geeraerts 2016. 86 (twice as many lexemes compared to other emotions), and this leads her to conclude that the Egyptians undoubtedly had a culture of joy.161 Goldwasser's the ory draws heavily on cognitive linguistics,162 and many lexicographical studies on emotions too draw heavily on cognitive linguistics, especially on what is called the conceptual metaphor theory (henceforth CMT).163 The central postulate of cognitive linguis tics is that cognition is embodied,164 and the instances of metaphors wherein abstract concepts are expressed in terms of bodily experience is one of the tangible evidence for this postulate.165 Ines Kohler's \" Rage like an Egyptian\" (2016) is a lexicographic al study that specifically focuses on the emotion of anger.166 She provides a thorough overview of cognitive linguistics and the previous Egyptological studies inspired by cognitive linguistics. She then proceeds to show the ways in which Egyptian conceptualization of anger derives from conceptual metaphors grounded in embodied experience. More specifically, she identifies 14 main words belonging to the lexical field [ ANGER ], and organizes the passages (usually very short) into 10 conceptual metaphors, where anger is spoken in terms of or relation to a body part (hear t), the color red, animals, a disease, etc. Finally, she presents the Egyptian worldviews relevant to each metaphor. 161 Beaux 2017, 238. 162 For an overview of application of cognitive lin guistics in Egyptology, Nyord 2015. 163 On cognitivist semantics, Dingfang 2009; Geeraerts 2010, 182 For its application in Egyptology, Nyord 2012, 141 -174. 164 I.e., all abstract concepts ultimately derive from our immediate experienc e of physical action and perception. 165 According to CMT, metaphors are not just a linguistic phenomenon or a rhetorical device but a fundamental cognitive mechanism whereby the conceptual structure of one domain of experience (usually a more concrete, tangible, physical, or familiar one, the source domain) is transferred to another conceptual domain (usually an abstract, intangible, or complex one), the target domain. For instance, for the conceptual metaphor of ARGUMENT IS WAR, the concrete experience of w ar (source) is applied to the abstract concepts of argument (target). Lakoff and Johnson 1980. It is common practice to write conceptual metaphors in small caps and the linguistic expressions in italics. 166 There are two different publications with the sam e title. The 2011 publication is an article in English; the 2016 publication is a monograph in German. 87 Sven Eicke's \"History of Horror: A Diachronic Overview of Fear(s) in Ancient Egyptian Texts\" (2020) is another study that adopts CMT.167 In addition to CMT, Eicke adopts something called emotionology , formulated by Carol and Peter Stearns in order to consider emotions as culture -specific phenomena from a social constructivist perspective.168 After a brief overview of the theoretical framework, he provides a list of fear -words and provides examples from a variety of texts ranging from the Old Kingdom to Greco -Roman times from different genres. Certain Egyptian fear words are considered more cl assical or prototypical than others, not based on their distribution across different genres or the number of known attestations, etc., but because they simply are.169 He constantly uses phrases like \"real emotion\", \"emotion in the true sense,\" without expl icating what is meant by \"real\" or \"true.\" For instance, in regards to the emotions represented in the Egyptian texts, he says that they are far from being \"real\" because they were subject to the rules of decorum.170 Without addressing these problems, he th en proceeds to identify the global conceptual metaphor that underlies the expressions. Camilla Di Biase -Dyson and Ga elle Chantrain's \"Metaphors of Sensory Experience in Ancient Egyptian Texts\" (2021) is another lexical semantics study that draws on CMT. Unlike 167 Eicke 2020, 25 -51. 168 Emotionlogy is thought to be distinct from emotion in that it represents \"the attitudes or standards that a society, or a definable group within a society, maintains toward basic emotions and their appropriate expressions; ways that institutions reflect a nd encourage these attitudes in human contact.\" Cited by the author from Stearns and Stearns 1985, 813. 169 In the introduction, he provides a working definition of fear as \" a phenomenon that is a physical and/or psychological reaction, usually but not alway s to a previous perceived stimulus, which can be of various kinds; it is basically uncomfortable and can vary in its intensity and dura tion.\" Eicke 2020, 17. After he lists the Egypt ian fear words with their dictionary meanings, he then says: \" on the basis of the entries in these three dictionaries alone, it can be seen that some words appear \u2014apparently \u2014to be \"more\" fearful than others, while in some lexemes the question arises as to whether there is any kind of fear at all. For example, one gets the impres sion that nrw is a \"classic\" word for fear, at least more prototypical than fyt, which seems more like an expression of a respectful honor.\" Ibid., 31. One would then expect that he proceeds in a way that shows his impression is correct after all. But instead, he uses his impression as the premise for making particular translational choices he makes and makes certain claims about metaphors. 170 Ibid., 29. His assumption is that only everyday utility texts that are not subject to decorum can express \"real\" feelings. This is something that needs to be proven before it could be used as a premise for argument. 88 the previous two works that focus on one specific emotion, this study sets out to study something broader. According to them, it is a phenomenon well -attested across languages that emotions are metaphorically described in terms of sensory experience s (smell, touch, sight, sounds, etc.),171 and such expressions are said to carry a greater affective load than other comparable expressions in that they can evoke an affective response in the brain and lead to physical reactions evoking the source domain.172 For their approach to emotions, they draw on definitional framework by Klaus Scherer, who distinguishes emotion from feeling on one hand and from temperant (\"affect disposition\") on the other.173 Their goal is to demonstrate that Egyptian examples fit into the model. They list many Egyptian words that can be taken as sensory words when translated into English, and they provide the examples where these sense words are used metaphorically to describe emotions. 171 I.e., metaphors of emotions use a type of sensor y perception as their source domain. 172 For instance, one line of research has shown that expressions involving taste metaphors (like \"sweet\") activate primary and secondary gustatory areas more than literal language (like \"kind\"). Biase -Dyson and Chantrain 2021, 604. The cited study is by Francesca Citron and Adele Goldberg 2014. 173 Apart from the brief mention, there is little explication/discussion on the definitional framework, and the authors themselves seem to be switching back and forth in what is mean t by emotions. Sometimes emotions are bodily, sometimes emotions are concepts, sometimes simply \"a temporary state of mind.\" 89 CHAPTER 3 Pain in Egyptian M agico -Med ical Texts 3.1 Introduction Pain and medicine are intimately related. Situations of pain may arise in any area of life, but they are more concentrated in the area of medicine, for medicine is specifically about diagnosing and treating pain. It is therefore not surprising that modern pain studies are carried out in clinical settings, or that the history of pain becomes intertwined with the history of medicine. As is well known, ancient Egyptian civilization was known for its long -established intellectual traditions surrounding medicine, which frequently captured the Greek imagination and curiosity.1 References to pain and medicine are not uncommon in Homer,2 and the following characterization of Egyptian medicine, however fictitious and idea lized, is worth citing so as to get us start thinking about pain in the context of Egyptian medicine. In the Odyssey , Helen serves her guests with the wine mixed with a special drug from Egypt: ...a drug ( pharmaka ) to quiet all pain and strife, and bring for getfulness of every ill ... Such cunning drugs had the daughter of Zeus, drugs of healing, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon, had given her, a woman of Egypt, for there the earth, the giver of grain, bears greatest store of drugs, many that are healing when mixed, and many that are baneful; there every man is a physician, wise above human kind; for they are of the race of Paeon.3 This chapter explores Egyptian understandings of and approaches to pain in magico -medical texts. In the first part of the chapter, I trace and unpack the textual references to pain in the 1 Von Staden 1989, 1 -3; Jouanna 2012, 3 -20 (English translation of a 2004 article published in French). 2 For pain and medicine in Homer, see Holmes 2007. 3 Odyssey 4, 219 -32, translation by Murray 1919. According to Lang (2012, 174), \"the reputation of E gypt for both the power of its ingredients and the expertise of its inhabitants in producing pharmaka was a standard trope of Greek discourse for Peace 1253; Oration 36, 124. Theophrastes Enquiry into Plants 15.1, citing the Odyssey passage. 90 records of medical diagnosis and treatment. It was already shown in the previous chapter was that words like mn, mr, h and qsn in the magico -medical texts have their meaning specified to bodily pain (as opposed to moral suffering, for instance); it was also suggested that often it sounds more natural to translate them in to English using words such as illness or ailment, among others, than pain. This chapter suggests that this translation difficulty has to do, in part, with the fact that in Egyptian magico -medical texts, pain is better understood in reference to disruptive processes/state or elements involved therein than in reference to painful sensations. During the examination and diagnosis, pain is framed as a physiological problem, subject to empirical observation and measurement. In the treatment stage, pain is viewed as reality or a force to be contended with. Either way, pain is conceived as having a concrete, objective reality. The chapter also uses pain as an opportunity to think about Egyptian medicine and pharaonic values. From a modern perspective, that pain ca n be framed both as a physiological problem and a force to be contended with may appear contradictory. For one thing, the former does not seem to require the notion of agency, while the latter does. When a natural phenomenon is assigned agency of its own, though people would no longer use the word \"primitive\", a host of labels are summoned, from religion and spirituality to psychology and metaphor, i.e., labels that are used for something that goes beyond the immediate reality or beyond what can be ascertai ned by science, and therefore considered (albeit implicitly) less \"real.\" Applying these terms are not all together inappropriate , but doing so can hinder us from seeing Egyptian medicine and Egyptian understandings of pain on their own terms. The second p art of the chapter is devoted to delineating the context within which the Egyptian understandings and responses to pain operated as a part of coherent discourse. By interweaving a selection of primary sources from the Old Kingdom to the Ptolemaic era, I sh ow how Egyptian medicine is intimately connected with the 91 institution of pharaonic kingship and the notion of maat . Based on this account, I then suggest that Egyptian medical understanding of pain, too, is closely related with the pharaonic kingship and maat. 3.2 Pain in Magico -Medical Texts4 Before I delve into textual analysis, a brief note on the corpus is in order. The primary texts examined in this chapter are papyrus Ebers and papyrus Edwin Smith. Both are paleographically dated to the Second Intermediate Period to early New Kingdom and r epresent the largest and best preserved among the extant medical papyri. Papyrus Ebers, now housed at the library of the University of Leipzig, measures approximately 18 m in length and 30 cm in height. The papyrus covers a broad range of topics .5 In tota l, the collection consists of 110 columns6 or 877 paragraphs,7 and covers various medical ailments (stomach problems to burns, eye disease, cardiovascular problems, and such) to gynecological and cosmetic concerns. Papyrus Edwin Smith, housed in the New York Academy of Medicine, is only second in size to Ebers. It measures 4.7 m in length and 32 cm in height, consisting of 17 pages on the recto and 5 pages on the verso.8 It is commonly referred to as the Surgical Papyrus or Wundbuch 4 For a comprehensive overview of Egyptian magico -medical texts, see Westendorf 1999, 4 -79. Nunn's general introduction (1996, 24 -41) is also good in that it includes various interesting trivia that are not usually treated in t he scholarly overviews. See also Nyord 2020 for up -to-date bibliography. 5 It was originally purchased by Edwin Smith in Luxor 1862, but G. Ebers, an Egyptologist, purchased it from Smith in the early 1870s and re -named it with his own surname. The first publication is by Ebers in 1875. There is a hieroglyphic transcription by Wreszisnky in 1913; the definitive translation is the one in German by von Deines, Grapow and Westendorf (1958), which Ghaliounghui translated into English in 1987. 6 Actually, Ebers consists of 108 columns total, but the scribe made a mistake in numbering them. The last column is assigned the number 110 and columns 28 and 29 have been dropped out. Ghalioungui 1987, 3. 7 There are two numbering systems in use. The first method is by column and line, the second, the paragraph numbering system. This chapter cites Ebers using both numbering systems. The same applies to citation of passages from Edwin Smith. 8 It was first p urchased in Luxor in 1862 by the American Edwin Smith (collector, adventurer, money lender, antiquities dealer, and possibly a consultant and practitioner of the forgery of antiquities). The original provenance is unknown, thought it mostly likely to have come from the Theban region, either from a temple library or a tomb. The Rhind mathematical papyrus may have come from the same tomb. Nunn 1996, 26. For a detailed history of the papyrus after its discovery, Breasted 1930, 20 -5. 92 (\"book of wounds\") i n German, and has been highly regarded for its \"scientific\" nature.9 More specifically, the 48 cases on the recto provide detailed descriptions of various traumatic injuries that are organized according to the same order followed in Gray's Anatomy .10 All the cases in the recto of Smith and some portions of Ebers are presented in sw (instruction manual) format.11 Following a fixed structure of protases and apodoses, the sw shows a formal and logical approach to medical examination and diagnosis.12 More specifically, after a title, they start with a string of conditionals of the form, \"if you examine a man who...(suffering from symptom a, b and c),\" followed by in the form of apodosis, \"then you shall say...(the name or cause of the illness),\" and \"then you shall do...(treatment procedures).\" Earlier scholars understood this format as the direct reconstruction of the actual medical encounter.13 Although sw texts make up only 7 -20% of all the medical texts,14 the casuistic concreteness and the systematic approach to organizing knowledge provide insight into the nature of the problems the Egyptian physicians faced and the concepts and the tools that guided their choices. As such, in the absence of explicit formulation of pain aetiology in the Egyptian corpus,15 sw texts serve as important clues from which we can infer Egyptian ideas about the 9 Breasted 1930, 15 10 Nunn 1996, 29. 11 The exact meaning of the word sw has been disputed. It derives from the verb s, \"to be experienced,\" \"knowledgeable\" ( Wb. IV, 543.7 -544.7), attested since the Old Kingdom. Scholars have variously translated the term as \"instructions,\" \"indicators,\" and \"diagnosis.\" The noun sw, \"experience, skill,\" is known outside magico - medical texts since the Middle Kingdom. For further discussion, see Breasted 1930, 79 -80; Westendorf 1 998, 82086; Sanchez and Meltzer 2012, 33 -34; Pommerening 2014, 9. For the semantic analysis of s, Winand 2016, 124-125. 12 Nunn, who was a physician himself, notes that sw texts \"visualize the ancient Egyptian doctor's examination of the patient, and we can gain considerable insight into the processes by which he arrived at diagnosis.\" Nunn 1996, 27. 13 Breasted 1930, 6 -8; Nunn 1996, 113 -114. 14 Pommerening 2014, 10. 15 Cf. Lang 2013, 103: \"Explicit references to physiological and pathological ideas are pr esent but rare, and theory is not discussed in detail in any extant work. Many of the terms used \u2014whether for disease, disease causes, bodily organs, symptoms, or ingredient in remies \u2014do not occur outside the medical texts and are of uncertain and possibly multiple meanings that depended heavily on contextual understanding, one that we have great difficulty recovering.\" 93 concept and the causes of pain. Accordingly, the analysis provided in the first three subs ections (3.2.1 -3.2.3) are exclusively from the sw texts. 3.2.1 \" If You Examine a Man Pained in...\" A typical sw text begins with the phrase r k s, \"If you examine a man who...\" The word is of interest because it characterizes medical conditions as objective and measurable.16 As indicated by the determinative with forearm carrying a measuring rod (D40),17 the primary meaning of is is to make an assessment of an object with reference to a given unit of measurement. The same idea is at work in medical examination, too, but the question arises: what exactly is the physician measuring, and with reference to what? Aside from the gloss to Case 1 of Smith, which will be discussed below, the methods of examination are not explicitly discuss ed in Egyptian medical texts. It is only by tracing the language used to list the symptoms that we gain some ideas about the object and procedures of medical examination. As we shall see, the focus is laid on observing and describing the symptoms of pain d uring the examination, which takes into account complex physiological processes in the body . It is worth noting that the verb in medical examination seldom takes a direct object other than s.18 Taking the phrase r k s literally, what Egyptian p hysician examines is a man. Of course, the man examined is not just any man, but a man in pain, and not just a man in general pain, but a man pained in a specific body part. The phrase r k s is frequently followed by r mn + body part (stomach, head, etc.).19 From this introdu ctory formula, we learn that pain 16 For , see Wb. III 223.2 -3 and TLA lemma -no. 113400, as well as MedWb 644 -646. See also Winand 2016, 133-134 for the semantic analysis. 17 Less commonly, a man carrying a measuring rod (A24). 18 For the cases that take a direct object other s, see MedWb 654 13). The examples from Ebers come from the so -called \"book of the stomach,\" which forms a group of 20 individual tex ts. In Smith, r mn + body is less frequently attested (but see Sm \u00a71 (1, 3); 94 is not itself the object of examination, but the patient is the object of examination, and the pain is an event pertaining to the direct object s, the patient.20 After this introductory formula, symptoms are listed. The c lauses are of several different types, but all serve to connect the different symptoms to the primary site of pain. In Ebers, the clauses starting with w can be seen: Ebers \u00a7191 (37, 10 -11) wf mnf gbf mnd f gs n r-bf... If you examine a man who has pain in his stomach, he has pain in his arm, his chest, the side of his stomach...21 Ebers \u00a7192 (37, 17) -bf wf qsf ... If you examine a man who has pain in his stomach, he vomits a lot... Normally in Middle Egyptian, wf smf is taken as an independent clause, and having an independent clause in the middle of a conditional is difficult to explain.22 Perhaps the w clauses can be taken as syntactically independent, but semantically subordinate to the main r clause.23 As such , we can perhaps understand these w clauses as providing the general conditions the patient is under at the time of examination. Sm \u00a742 ( 14, 17)). As Smith is mainly concenered with external wounds and injuries, words for specific types of wounds and injuries are used in the place mn in the forumula. 20 Note the contrast with another common introductory formula where the verb wp is used instead of , which takes the disease or the condition as the direct object. Refer to MedWb 182 -183 for the attestations of wp. 21 Magico -medical texts pose special lexicographical and philological problems that are not easily resolved. Transliterations and translations provided here are based on several different sources, the mos t important of which is the Grundriss, as well as Wreszinski's (1913) transcription and Ghalioungui's (1987) English translation of German in Grundriss for Ebers, and Breasted (1930) and Sanchez and Meltzer (2012) for Edwin Smith. For the anatomical termin ology, in addition to Grapow (1954), Walker (1996) have been consulted. 22 Refer to Westendorf 1962, \u00a7\u00a7 232 -235. 23 For more on conditional clauses, see, among others, Satzinger 1993; Kruchten 1994; Allen 2002, 91 -93. 95 Clause types other than w clauses also occur and frequently with the verb gm, either gmm k or r gm k.24 These clauses are better thought of as the continuation of the examination formula, which provide a more specific indication of the type of examination.25 For gmm k clauses, gemination of m in gm indicates that the adverbials are to receive the emphasis .26 Ebers \u00a7199 (39, 21 -40, 1) r ik s r mn n m r-bf gmm k sw mf wf r b.wk m mrt m-nw nt If you examine a man who has obstruction in his stomach, you find that it moves under your fingers like grease inside the hide. Ebers \u00a7205 (41, 13 -14) r k s r mn r-bf r gm k sw .nf mr wf mnf wtyfy... If you examine a man who has pain in his stomach, if you find it having crossed the canal, while he has pain on his both sides... The object or the content of these clauses consists of the descriptions of findings expected at the moment of the examination. As opposed to the cases with the w clauses, gm clauses interrupt the description of symptoms to bring to light the agency of the physician in the process of examination and gives weight to the power of observation. Frequently, the gm clauses are preceded by a special verb form with infix n or r, which are used to express an action that is consequent on the preceding action.27 These clauses do not describe the symptoms, but denote the physician's action as a part of examination that will allow him to observe otherwise unnoticeable symptoms: Ebers \u00a7188 (36, 4 -8) r ... m.rk sw s sy 24 Hoch 1994, 918. 26 On n ominalization, see Hoch 1994, \u00a7148. 27 Allen 2000, 308 -309. 96 gmm k tf t... If you examine a man constipated in his stomach ... then you are to look at him lying stretched out, you find that his inside is burning... Ebers \u00a7203 (40, 18 -19) r gmk s.nf r gsf mny... If you examine a man who has pain in his stomach, you are to place your hand on him, if you find that he has become constricted on his left side... In the first example, m.rk sw s sy indicates that the physician is to have the patient take a posture different from the usual examination. The following gmm k clause gives the detail that the physician will be able to notice. In the second example, rd.nk r.tk indicates placing a hand on the patient in order to learn the processes inside the body. This will be discussed in greater detail below. Moving on to Smith, the same r ik s formula is used, but it is followed by the type of wound, most frequently wbnw, not by r mn.28 In Smith, gmm k is frequently employed to incorporate the extensive descriptive details of the symptoms that are based on sensory perception, such as sight and smell.29 In the example below, gmm k is followed by a chain of 7 adverbials: Smith \u00a77 (3, 10 -12) gmm k rf tms 28 wbnw occurs 142 times in Smith. The word specifically designates an injury to fleshy tissue. Breasted 1930, 81 - 83. Other types of wounds dealt in Smith are sd \"smash,\" pn \"split,\" thm \"perforation,\" and sm \"crushing.\" 29 For the full list of the cases in Sm ith that incorporate these sensory faculties, see Breasted 1930, 40 -41. 97 ndtf psd f sdy w rf m t rmf31 You find that his forehead clammy with sweat, the ligaments of his neck tense, his face ruddy, his teeth and his back [ -], the odor of the chest of his head like the urine of sheep, his mouth bound, his eye brows quivering. His face is like as if he wept. The level of descriptive details given here illustrates rigorous observation and precision in communication in medical diagnosis. Presumably, communicating precisely the result of such rigorous observation is difficult. The descriptive terms draw on many aspects of daily experienc e, from nature to the mechanical arts. Breasted notes that the language of Smith \"convey[s] the impression of a man actually involved in the process of building up a terminology in a field of observation not yet possessing a fund of current terms. \"32 Comp aring the appearance of the brain surface to molten copper provides another example of the use of vivid description of the wound. 33 Although identifying an ancient Egyptian anatomical term is usually laden with a great difficulty, the description given he re is so spot on that it leaves little doubt as to what the term must be referring to:34 Smith \u00a76 (2, 18 -21) r k s n wbnw -n-kft m tp f r n qs n nntf r.rk pn prw m mt n nt nhdhd np p r bwk m ht whnn n rd 30 Notice that ndtf psd f, \"his teeth and his back\" is not followed by any description. According to Breasted (1930, 182), this is likely to be a scribal omission. 31 This final claus e is headed by w, which renders this clause independent, unlike the preceding adverbials. 32 Breasted 1930, 10. 33 Presumably, what we have here is the earliest reference to the brain anywhere in human records. Breasted 1930, 166. 34 See Visual Index Vc in Sanchez and Meltzer 2012, 25 for the picture of the copper compound that is very similar in appearance to the copper slag. 98 If you examine a man of a gaping wound in his head, which penetrates to the bone, smashing his skull, and rending open the brain of his skull: You shall palpate his wound. What you find in that smash which is in his skull is [like] those ripples which occur in molten copper, a thing in it throbbing and fluttering under your fingers, like the weak place of an infant's crown... In addition to detailing what the brain looks like, the passage also describes how it is supposed to feel. Notice that the molten copper passage is preceded by the directive to touch or palpate the wound .35 In fact, what the gmm k is mainly interested in conveying is the detail the physician will find specifically by palpating the wound, that is, by what he feels under his fingers ( r bw.k). The words nhdhd and npp are unknown outside this text. 36 They seem to have been formed by reduplication of a biconsonantal with a prefixed n, which occurs mostly with verbs of motion, signifying the repetition or intensity of the type of motion conveyed in the root.37 Morphologically and contextually, then, we expect these words to convey s ome kind of motion, subject to tactile perception. At this point, it is worth turning to the vital piece of information that comes from Smith's commentary section. One of the unique features of Smith is that many phrases and terms are provided with the special glosses.38 One such obscure phrases glossed is k s.39 Smith \u00a71 (1, 3 -6) r k s p mn [pw ... mi i]pt t m pt t mnt m pt p mnt m bw r [r ...] n t t m pt [...] p mnt m mtt t mnt s r r mt ty As for \"you examine a man,\" [it means] counting someone ...

Sm \u00a74 (2, 3) and \u00a75 (2, 36 nhdhd and npp always occur together: Sm \u00a76 (2, 20 -21), Sm \u00a78 (4, 10 -11). The word nhd and nh occur in Eb \u00a7855 i (100, 21) to predicate mtw nw ty, of the Breasted 1930, 168 -169; G EG \u00a7276. 38 For the full list of the terms and phrases glossed, see Breasted 1930, 69 -71. 39 See Breasted 1930, 105ff for a more detailed commentary on this gloss. As for the form of medical glossary in general, ibid., 61 -62. 99 measure, or counting of so mething by the fingers, in order to [learn...]. It is measuring things with the oipe-measure which [...]40 pain is counted likewise, (and) the examination of pain of a man, in order to learn the movement of the heart. The lacunae in the text make it difficult to understand its meaning. One obvious point is that the medical examination of a man consists in making a quantitative assessment of a sort. In this passage, references are made to two different kinds of measureme nt, derived from daily life. The first kind of measurement uses the oipe -measure.41 The oipe -measure is used to measure the volume of objects, such as grains, that cannot easily be counted . It essentially consists in dividing the whole.42 The second kind o f measurement is numerical counting. Using your fingers, you can add up the total of individual objects in a set or group to measure their number. Medical examination resembles both measurement by oipe -measure and by numerical calculation, but the purpose of measurement in a medical examination is to learn the \"going\" or the \"movement\" of the heart . The text continues by defining the movement of the heart: Smith \u00a71 (1, 6 -8) w mtw 43 ty nt pw mtw f m- tp m st -b nt pw [mdw f nt] mt nb n t nbt There are vessels44 from it in [every] limb. [As for] these, whenever any priest of Sakhmet or any physician places his hands and his fingers [upon the head, upon the occiput], upon the place of heart, upon the two legs: he is ex[amining] the heart. This is 40 For the lacuna, Ritner suggests \"is what is like\" as a possible r estoration. Ritner 2006, 102 n. 18. 41 On oipe-measure, P ommerening 2010, 132 -137. 42 There are other Egyptian measurement units, but the oipe -measure is singled out probably to reinforce the meaning of p, \"counting.\" Also, it seems that the oipe-measure had a particular significance in the medical context because of its association with the eye of Horus. Cf. Hearst 14, 2 -4: \"As for this oipe-measure, it was the eye of Horus that was measured and examined. Isis brought it to her son Horus to open up the inside of his body and to bring down the evil things that were inside his body.\" 43 The verb form of here is of interest. The Smith has a lacuna, so based on the parallel in Ebers, Breasted restores . In Ebers, because the clause is followed by the adverbial r-ntt, having the germinated form makes sense. The Smith passage, however, has that r-ntt replaced by nt pw , which is sentence initial. On the nominals, see G \u00a7190, 2; Loprieno, Muller & 377 -378. 44 To be more precise, mtw does not refer only to blood vessels but to anything long and thin such as ducts, nerves, tendons, and muscles. A network of mtw does not squarely correspond to any one \"system\" known in modern medicine such a s nervous system, circulatory system or respiratory system. For more on mtw see Breasted 1930, 108; Nunn 1996, 44 -49; Bardinet 1995, 63 -68. 100 (means) that its (the heart's) vessels are at the back of the head from the place of heart. This means that it speaks out of every vessel of every limb. The passage here has an almost exact parallel in Ebers.45 There, the same passage serves as an introduction to the so -called \"vessel book,\" a treatise on the mtw -vessels and the heart.46 Here in Smith, it is cited to expound on the phrase k s, specifically in order to develop further the idea that was already introduced in the previous lines (l s.3-6).47 The verb now takes ty as the direct object, not s as in the previous lines. This serves to clarify that when one is said to examine a man it is really the ty that is being examined. But why ty? The following nt pw clauses explain why:48 because it connects a ll the limbs of the body through the vessels, and because from these vessels, the heart speaks ( mdw f). The gloss does not stop here but continues to explain what it is that the heart can tell the physician: Smith \u00a71 (1, 8 -9) df49 t r [dit rt]50 f r mtw f n mk f n rdwy f [...] tyf r r sw pr m m-d t s r r pryt m He says \"measuring\" regarding [the placing of] his [hands] on the vessels of head, of his occiput, of his two feet, [...51] his heart in order to learn the indications that occur therein, that is to say, \"measuring a man\" in order to know that which has occurred the rein. 45 Eb \u00a7854a (99, 2 -5). See Breasted 1930, 107 for a line -by-line comparison. The one significant difference is that in the Ebers version, instead of nt pw mtw f m m st-b, it has r-ntt mtw f n tf nb. This difference may be attributed to the fact that the Smith version was specifically adjusted to serve as a gloss to the case of head injury, in contrast to the Ebers version, which was meant to lay down more fundamental principles common to all cases. 46 Eb \u00a7\u00a7854 -855 (99, 1 -102, 16). 47 The previous section ended with the clause r r mt ty. Note that the parallel passage in Ebers bears the title of st n swnw r mt ty r ty, \"the secrets of the physician, knowing the movements of the heart, knowing the heart.\" 48 On the function of nt pw , Loprieno, Muller & Uljas 2019, 377 -378. 49 Who or what this 3ms pronoun must be referring to is not clear. It could refer to an authoritative figure or source that anyone reading a medical treatise would recognize. It is also possible, in view of the fact that the beginning of the text is broken, the identity of the figure or the source was already mentioned in a gloss to the previous case(s). In any case, the phrase df... r is one of several phrases that is commonly employed throughout Smith for glossing. 50 Judging by the context, dtf rt seem s a more appropriate restoration (several editions restored it this way) than what is suggested by Breasted, wbn, \"wound.\" 51 Possibly, \"measuring the vessels of\" following the restoration in Grundriss. 101 Here, the purpose clause r r from the first section and t ty from the second section are combined to introduce something new, namely sw pr im . To examine a man in pain means to examine the movement of the heart; the reason the action of the heart is measured is because it tells you what has occurred in the body parts. Breasted notes that for the Egyptian physician, \"the heart is a gauge by means of which the patient's condition may be appraised.\"52 In Ebers, knowledge of the movement of the heart is referred to as st n swnw , \"the secrets of the physician.\" A physician who possesses these secrets is able to decipher the heart's movements as intelligible indicators of the deeper changes in the patient's constitution. To him, a patient's heart is like an informant, who reports the unseen processes deep beneath the surface. Even though the physician himself does not undergo pain, this knowledge allows him to understand the nature of the patient's pain. With this gloss in mind, the directive r.rk wbnw in Smith can be understood, specifically, to take note of the heart's speech in order to gain further access into the interior processes of the body. In Ebers, we already saw the directive rd.nk rtk. Even when the directive is not explicitly given, based on references to the movement of heart that occur in the middle of the descriptions of the symptoms of the patient, we can infer that the practice would have been a part of the physician's examinatio n by default:53 Ebers \u00a7188 (36, 4 -9) r ik s r n r-bf dns f r wnmt w tf ns.t bf sf r mt mi s r mr tw nw p t If you examine a man who has obstruction in his stomach, heavy for food, his body is constricted, his heart is weak to move like a man sick with the heat of anus... 52 Breasted 1930, 109. 53 The following passage from a n autobiographical stela belonging to a physician named Nufer from the early 18th dynasty seems to indicate that this skill is something that is associated with an ideal physician: nk s wn mt s(w)nw r yt ny t, \"I am a truly excellent scribe and a phyisician effective of fingers, who owns many medic al manuals and probed diseases of the body.\" Edwards 1965, 25 -26, pl. XI.2, l. x+9. 102 Ebers \u00a7207 (42, 8 -10) r k s r n w bf wf iw rf d w bf dbdb If you examine a man with an obstruction, his heart flutters, his face is pale, and his heart thumps... Given the centrality of this practice to medical examination, it would have been important to convey accurately the information about the specific movem ent of the heart to understand the conditions of the heart under consideration.54 In these two examples, using the reduplicated verb, the heart's movement is explicated by comparing it to cases that produce a similar movement (the weak place of an infant's crown; a man sick with the heat of anus). Still, the ambiguity in meaning seems almost inevitable, and it is not surprising that the vessel book in Ebers includes many glosses concerning the movement and speech of the heart: Ebers \u00a7855 e (100, 14 -16) r md b tm mdt ty pw mtw r -pw n ty nb n wnt swsy r r.tyky pr w m msn As for \"the heart is faint,\" it means the heart doesn't speak, or the vessels of the heart are mute. Their indications do not exist under your hands, as the air fills them.55 Ebers \u00a7855 (101, 2 -5) r n b b pw m ty ky d b m ty pr hf p.nf tf bf r wt As means -heart in the ty-heart. Another statement: the ib heart in the ty heart. He came out and went down, having reached the throat area (?), his heart is under the condition of wit. 54 This brings us to the question of the method of the measurement. The analogy with the oipe-measure would seem to point to some sort of quantitative information. Breasted (1930, 105-106) thinks of this in terms of counting the number of pulses per a given measure of time. But this would require not only a portable time -measuring device, but an array of other features that we do not have any evidence fo r. Bardinet (1995, 86) therefore rejects Breasted's view and suggests that what is being measured is simply the degree of illness in the affected body part. Somewhere between the two is a view (by Dominique Spaeth, cited in Halioua 2005, 25) that the Egypt ian physicians examined the pulse qualitatively (in terms of strength and rhythm) and semi -qualitatively (slow or accelerated). In Traditional Chinese Medicine, no time measuring device is required for pulse diagnosis. 55 Because the heart's movement is so frequently described in terms of speech, sometimes it can be confusing whether it the verb is referring to the heart's speech or actual speech. For instance, Sm \u00a77 (3, 3) reads w qsn wr bf r mdt , \"it is painful for him to open his mouth, and his heart is feeble to speak.\" Here, it's not clear whether it's mdt is referring to the heart's movement or the patient's ability to talk. 103 So far, I have focused on the ways in which physicians use his sensorial perception and knowledge and thus notice the abnormal conditions manifest in the patient. Remarkably in Smith, the patient's physiological sensation of pain becomes incorporated into the examination process as well. In the example below, the physician instructs the patient to attempt certain movement, and the pain the patient feels as the result of the movement is listed with other symptoms. Smith \u00a719 (7, 15 -17) r ik s <n> thm gs f ry sqr pf... If you examine a man in his temple, a wound being upon it: You should inspect his wound, saying to him, \"look at your two shoulders.\" His doing so is painful, his neck turns around only little. His eye on his side with that injury is blood -shot... Sometimes, the pain produced by the motion is the only symptom. This is the c ase for the condition referred to as nrwt, \"sprain\": Smith \u00a730 (10, 9 -10) r k s n nrwt m s n n pr m-f If you examine me a man for a sprain in a vertebra of his neck: You should say to him. \"Look at your two shoulders and your chest.\" When he does, the seeing which happens to him is painful. Smith \u00a748 (17, 15 -18) r k nrwt m s n f If you examine [a man for] a sprain in a vertebra of his back, you should say to him: Extend now your legs. Contract them. He shall extend them and contract them immediately because of the pain he makes in the vertebra of his back in which he suffers. 104 Also, as seen in the example below, we see pain being used as the deciding factor for making the diagnosis after the process of elimination: Smith \u00a742 (14, 17 -18) r k mnf nw nw qbtf n wnt wn wr If you examine [a man for a sprain in the ribs of his chest], and he suffers in the ribs of his chest, there being no dislocation, it not having been broken, while that man keeps suffering in it, and shudders greatly. The presence, or absence of pain would have been made known to the physician by the patient's report. Hence, the patient's ability to communicate with the physician is important throughout the examination process. However, even when the patient is unable to do so, the physician takes note of the patient's inability and incorporates this into his observation: Smith \u00a720 (8, 1 -3) r ndk rtyfy m s n rtf m rrt rd n r f rrtf If you inquire of him his injury, he is not able to speak to you, lots of tears falling from his eyes and he has to take his hand to his face so as to wipe his eyes with the back of his palm like what a child does, and he does not know what he does. Smith \u00a722 (8, 12) r nis{.n?} k nf iwf dgmy n mdw.n f If you call him, he is dazed and is not able to speak. 56 Breasted 1930, 143 -144. 105 In the context of Egyptian medical examination, then, pain can be understood as various symptoms that patients display that a physician can discern by his various senses. 3.2.2 \"You Then Shall Say...Pain I Will Treat!\" In a clinical encounter, examination is followed by diagnosis. As the etymology of the word suggests (from diagign 57 diagnosis implies an act of discerning or knowing one thing apart from ot hers. In modern clinical terminology, a symptom refers to a mere phenomenon of abnormality. Only when a physician takes the symptom and interprets it does the symptom become intelligible and meaningful, which constitutes the first step in leading to a diag nosis. One can say that pain is given an explanation and/or a name through diagnosis. In sw text, too, we see the examination being followed by the diagnosis. Diagnosis section begins with the formula is d.rk or d.nk, \"you then shall say\". The gr ammatical form, the narrative contingent tense of sm.rf 58 or sm.nf59indicates that the clause is to serve as an apodosis of the r k clause regarding the examination, which, in turn sets up the expectation that the content of this clause would function as something corresponding to diagnosis. Whatever the physician is to say, it will some sort of an explanatory account of the symptoms h e has observed during the examination. In many cases, however, the content of the diagnosis does not immediately meet the expectation set up by the grammatical and logical forms. More specifically, instead of providing an interpretation of the observed de tails, in many cases diagnoses offer a trivial, almost verbatim, 57 The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology . 58 Westendorf 1962, \u00a7\u00a7270 -275. 59 Westendorf 1962, \u00a7\u00a7280 -283. 106 repetition or summary of the examination section. This is most pronounced in Smith. The two examples below suffice to illustrate this repetitive nature: Smith \u00a712 (5, 16 -17) sw sb m tyt nt fnd f r k s n sb m fnd f mr ry Indications of a fracture in the vault of his nose If you examine a man for a fracture in the vault of his nose What you find is that his nose... You then shall say concerning him, \"one who has a fracture in the vault of his nose , an ailment I will treat.\" Smith \u00a717 (7, 1 -5) sw sd m mndt f r k s n sd m mndt f ... sk sw df snf m rf ms rf m rf dgmy mr n rw.ny Indications of a smash in his cheek If you examine a man for a smash in his cheek ... while he discharges blood from his nostril, from his ear on the side that has that injury, while he, at the same time, discharges blood from his mouth, while it is painful when he opens his mouth because of it, You then shall say concerning him, \"one having a smash in his check, while he discharges blood from h is nostril, from his ear, from his mouth , and speechless, an ailment not to be treated.\" The repetitive tendency seems related to the very nature of the medical conditions that Smith specializes in. Even today, when you go to see a physician after breaking your nose, the kind of explanation that a physician can provide appears quite limited. A physician may take a CT scan or an X -ray, but this does not amount to explaining the cause of the broken nose, or of the pain of the broken nose. In Smith, the primary concern seems to be in adhering to the established format of the genre. The step of mak ing a formal pronouncement would have been perceived as 107 constitutive of the proper sw, something that had to be included, even when the content did not add anything new.60 Notice that in the three examples cited from Smith, the diagnoses all end with the statements which Breasted refer to as the \"verdicts.\"61 The three variants differ according to the treatability of the conditions. The positive variants, mr ry, \"illness/pain I will treat\" and mr n, \"pain/illness I will contend with \" are attested in other texts, but the negative variant, mr n rw.ny , \"pain/illness which is not to be treated\" is unique to Smith.62 According to Breasted, it is the verdict that is the focal point of the diagnosis in Smith.63 The repetitive portion is f or formality; it does not identify the cause of the condition or explain pain. The primary concern is expressing the course of his procedure. Ebers, having been compiled from a wide range of sources and covering a wide range of medical issues, contains s everal different types of diagnoses.64 The most common kind diagnostic statement uses an A pw bipartite nominal construction.65 While pw is easily mistaken as a copula, however, it is, strictly speaking, a subject element.66 Moreover, since pw retains its original deictic feature,67 its meaning must be determined from its context. In the medical 60 Taking note of this \"underdeveloped\" aspect of the diagnoses found in Smith, Breasted adds (1930, 7): \"...the development of a full diagnosis is a relatively recent matter. Even in European medicine it was customary to describe only the conspicuous symptoms in a diagnosis until the advances made by Sydenham in the Seventeenth Century. In view of the fact that the elaborate diagnosis of the present day was so recently preceded by a simple description of the more noticeable symptoms, we may not expect the surg eon of nearly five thousand years ago to have gone very far in this direction.\" There are, however, a number of unusual cases in Smith where diagnoses do not repeat the findings of the examination but state conclusions reached through an inductive process. There are twelve such cases in total, and according to Breasted (1930, 49), they constitute \"the most important body of materials in the whole treatise... the earliest existent evidences of an inductive process in the history of the human mind.\" See Breaste d 1930, 49 -51 for the description of these cases. 61 Breasted 1930, 46. See the previous chapter. 62 Cf. Breasted 1930, 47. See Westendorf 1962, \u00a7245 for the grammatical note. 63 Breasted 1930, 48. In some cases (e.g., \u00a7\u00a76, 8, and 34), the verdict constitutes the entire diagnosis. 64 For typology of different types, see Radestock 2015 and 2020. 65 The initial element, A, serves as the predicate of pw. Allen 81; Loprieno, Muller & U ljas 2019, 373. 66 It derives from the Old Egyptian masculine singular distance neutral demonstrative adjective. Jenni 2009. 67 Loprieno, Muller & Uljas 2019, 368 108 diagnoses, pw seems to refer to the conditions just described (the observed symptoms from the examination). Below are a few examples: Ebers \u00a7188 (36, 8 -9) d.rk rf spw pw n m st You then shall say regarding it: it is the case of liver. Ebers \u00a7191 (37, 12) d.rk rs qt-m-r pw mwt pw ns.nf68 You then shall say regarding it: it is \"that which enters by the mouth\"; this is death which he has traveled. Ebers \u00a7192 (37, 19) d.rk rf sw pw nw stt f n h.n(sn) r np wf You then shall say regarding it: it is the rotten products of his phlegm, which are not able to descend to his groin. Ebers \u00a7193 (38, 5 -6) d.rk rf sn pw s n stf You then shall say regarding it: it is a gathering of feces that has not yet settled down. Ebers \u00a7198 (39, 14) d.rk rf snf pw s n s.t(w) f You then shall say regarding it: it is blood of swamp, which is not bound. Ebers \u00a7197 (39, 9 -10) d.rk rf n pw n pr k You then shall say regarding it: it is unevenness69 of your house. Ebers \u00a7831 (96, 17 -18) d.rk rs t pw r mts You shall say regarding it: it is a scratch on her uterus. Ebers \u00a7832 (96, 20 -21) 68 That qt m r is not split by pw (into qt pw m r ) suggests that qt-m-r is a bound construction (an 85980. Originally means \"unevenness,\" but when used of the heart, a pathological condition. Lloyd 1975, 63 -65; Grundriss IV/2, 86 n. 4; Westendorf 1999 , 581. 109 d.rk rs tm mws pw n smns You shall say regarding it: it is that she is not regular in her menstruation. Ebers \u00a7833 (97, 3 -4) d.rk rs t pw nt snf r mts ft nts You shall say regarding it: it is a congestion of blood in her uterus. In view of the fact that the common use of the A pw construction is to name or explain (conventionally translated into English as \"it is A,\" or \"it means A\"), the use of the nominal bipartite construction seems to fit well with that the expected function of a diagnosis.70 It is, however, not all that clear at what level these diagnoses are meant to name or explain the symptoms, for instance whether they are meant to provide an account of underlying physiological/pathological process or a causal/ etiological explanation. In her detailed typological study of medical diagnoses in Egyptian medical treatises, Radestock identifies five different types and refers to the type of diagnoses just cited as \"paraphrases of states of suffering.\"71 According to her, the paraphrase group c onstitutes the biggest group among the five types and can be further divided into seven subgroups.72 I myself am not able to see such fine distinctions between all the different types of diagnoses, though. It suffices to say that the criteria by, or the le vels at, which diagnoses are made are not uniform. Sometimes the diagnoses are 70 The subject element pw is explanandum ; A is explanans , to use the Latin terminology. 71 I am mainly referring to the materials from her 2020 article published in English. More detailed analysis and discussion can be found in her dissertation published in 2015 in German. 72 Radestock 2020, 110 -111. 110 made by referring to a bodily organ73 sometimes they are made by identifying a pathological entity74 or pathological condition.75 Some of the diagnoses in Ebers do not contain any A pw construction and consist of independent verbal clauses. Unlike an A pw construction, which is unmarked for mood or tense, the verbal constructions have a temporal reference and/or convey modal meaning. They impart information sequentially to the p hysician's understanding of the underlying physiological process. In the first example below, the prospective form expresses what will happen once the treatment is administered to the patient. In the second example, the w sm.nf form expresses the physi cian's appraisal of what must have happened prior to the current state. Ebers \u00a7199 (40, 2) d.rk rs hyf m r f m s You then shall say regarding it: it shall come down from his mouth as mucus. Ebers \u00a7204 (41, 6) d.rk rf w yt You then shall say regarding it: It made a shore, it having gathered sand. The following example combines A pw sentence and w sm.nf construction , which results in a more comprehensive diagnosis. It identifies the cause of the condition and describes the development of the disease. Ebers \u00a7196 (39, 4 -6) nwt pw nt sw n ss.n.tw f n w b r sp wrw w r.nf sd w sw ryt w E.g., \u00a7188, \u00a7831, \u00a7833. As for \u00a7188, I am following the editors of the Grudriss , who translate spw in this passage as Fall von , \"the case of.\" See MedWb 733. Alternatively, spw here can be understood as what is translated into German as Mittel , \"remedy.\" If understood as the latter, the diagnosis here is being made in reference to the treatment. The nuance of the two interpretations differs. Grundriss acknowledges that making distinctions between the two meanings is difficult. MedWb 740, \u00a71. Althugh I am opting for the first interpretation, the la tter interpretation is also quite plausible, especially when it is taken into account the fact that the treatment in this case requires a sp n s t n smyt rrw swnw , \"a secret remedy of herbs which a physician has prepared\" that has to be drunk by the pat ient multiple times in order to p, \"cleanse,\" and n, \"hydrate,\" the liver. 74 E.g., \u00a7192. 75 E.g., \u00a7193, \u00a7832. 111 It is a congestion of a heap, which cannot be lifted. The heart does not endure a bad case of illness. It has formed a tumor. The pus rots. The damage struck. Finally, some diagnoses feature a participial statement introduced by the particle n. They a re found among the instructions on diagnosing different kinds of tumors and swellings.76 In the examples below, the A pw sentences first identify the specific type of tumor/swelling responsible for the symptoms. The participial statements then go a step fu rther and identify the more fundamental entity or process (relating to the vessels) responsible for the particular tumor/swelling just identified. As indicated by the germination of r in the participle irr, the action of this latter entity on the anteceden t is understood not as one -time event but generic or habitual.77 Ebers \u00a7864 (106, 10 -12) d.nk rs t pw nt bs nw tf mr ry n tw r ptyt nt m tf rr sw You shall say regarding it: this is a tumor of the coverings of his belly. An illness I will treat. It is heat in the bladder in front of his belly that makes it. Ebers \u00a7872 (108, 6 -13) d.nk rs t pw nt mr ry n mtw rr st ws grt prs m ( )tw r mt You shall say regarding it: this is a vascular tumor. An illness I will treat. It is vessels that make it, while it also arises from injuries on a vessel. Ebers \u00a7876 (109, 13 -14) d.nk sft pw nt mt n sqr n mt rr st You shall say: this is a sft-appearance of the vessel. It is the smack on a vessel that makes it. 76 Eb \u00a7\u00a7857 -62 (103, 19 -106, 2) are ( nnt); \u00a7\u00a7863 -75 (106, 2 -109, 11) tumors (t); \u00a7\u00a7876 -77 (109, 11 -110, 9) are concerned with additional swellings. 77 Allen 2010, 338 -339 on the difference between perfective and imperfective participles in participial statements. 112 Note that in the first two examples the participial statements come after the verdict, which, as we saw in Smith, usually come at the end of diagnoses. It is likely that these partic ipial statements are later additions. Moreover, in view of the fact that this treatise is placed right after the vessel book, in which such participial statements are a regular feature, it is possible that the diagnoses here represent the efforts to integr ate knowledge of the heart and vessels into the pre -existing tradition(s) on the diagnoses of the tumors and swellings. Here we may be witnessing the process by which the Egyptian medical diagnoses grew more elaborate over time with the broadening of the e xplanatory framework. Overall, while lacking a unified frame of reference, or nomenclature,78 Egyptian medical diagnoses reflect endeavors to understand more fundamental processes underlying various painful conditions. Before moving on, I want briefly to consider the question of demons and similar hostile volitional agents as the purported cause of pain. As we shall see shortly, in the treatment stage, references to such entities are common.79 Yet, it is rare to see them mentioned in the diagnos es. Only in some glosses do we come across them, and they betray efforts to figure out where these \"supernatural\" forces fit into the whole picture.80 To illustrate, a case in Smith mentions how a 78 In this regard, it is worth taking note of the fact that even in mo dern medicine, where the diagnostic criteria are fairly standardized, some conditions are diagnosed based on the causes, some are based on the underlying mechanism, and some are determined by grouping a range of relevant symptoms (syndrome, disorder). Cf. Ghalioungui (1966, 127): \"there is no concept more abstract or more elusive than that of disease. To primitive man, disease was a symptom. All archaic medical treatises are symptomatic pharmacopoeias. But as soon as the primitive mind started to work, it s tarted to theorize, and nothing could then stop it in its accelerated course. The earliest grouping of symptoms to clearly defined syndromes, re -appearing with reasonable faithfulness to type, may have been a contribution of the Egyptian physicians who des cribed, under the names of aaa, spn, skwt, tmit, etc., certain symptom associations, although it is not clear from their writings whether these names defined the symptom - complex or the external agent to which disease was then attributed.\" 79 See the spells from Ebers cited below. References to demons are also very common in the later New Kingdom materials. Refer to Lucarelli 2010 for the demons and diseases. 80 Cf. Eb \u00a7855u (102, 4 -5): r q b mht b n w n r- ry-hb rr st qf sm m spw prr b th rs, \"as for the fading of the heart and forgetfulness of the heart, it is the breath of the activity of a lector priest that does this. It enters the lung several times, and the heart goes forth distracted because of this.\" 113 swelling caused by a closed skull fracture is to be disti nguished from that which is caused by qt m rwty , \"that which enters from outside\" (4, 7 -8). The phrase qt m rwty is then glossed as: Smith \u00a78 (4, 16 -17) r qt m rwty w pw n n r n rwty mt r -pw n sqt.n qmt wf As for that which enters from outside, it means the breath of an outside god or a dead being. It is that which the product of his flesh has caused to enter. Some grammatical ambiguity exists. Breasted interprets n as a rarer form of negation and translates the phrase as \"not the int rusion of something which his flesh engenders.\"81 Alternatively, it could be understood in light of the aforementioned examples of diagnosis from Ebers that feature a participial statement with pattern A pw + in B [rr sw ]. Regardless of how one resolves the ambiguity, the gloss shows that a certain distinction is made between something that enters the body on its own and something that has been led to enter by the body. This once again reveals the depth of Egyptian medical thought. 3.2.3 Treating Pain Once the patient has been examined and diagnosed, he is to be treated for his pain. As a logical next step, treatment follows the diagnosis in sw texts. The section is marked by the phrase r.rk, \"you shall do/make,\" which is connected to the verb seq uence in the examination and the diagnosis ( r k...d.nk...).82 It then gives instructions on how the patient is to be treated. In Ebers, the treatment usually consists of pharmacological prescriptions, with the list of the ingredients and the instruc tions on how to make and use them. For treating traumatic injuries, 81 Breasted 1930, 212 & 214. MedWb 55 n. 1, however, points out Breasted's interpretation is far from being satisfactory. Others have taken n as a non -enclitic particle, while n before qmt as negation. For instance, Bardinet (1995, 500) gives the translation, \"si quelque chose que produit le corps. \" Similarly, Westendorf (1998, 720) translates it as \"also/f\u00fcrwahr etwas, das zum Eindringen das sein Korper hervorbringt.\" This interpretation, however, does not explain the presence of t in qmt. 82 On the significance of the pairin g and sequentiality of d and r in sw texts, see Fischer -Elfert 2021. 114 such as those recorded in Smith, surgical operations such as the use of stitches, the application of an adhesive plaster, the realignment of dislocated bones, and so on, are prescribed. Ho wever, these mechanical aspects of the treatment are often included in the examination section instead of the treatment section. 83 According to Breasted, such placement likely reflects the Egyptian view that the mechanical processes do not constitute a r eal treatment. It is only that which involves the characteristic agency of the physician \u2014the preparation and application of medicaments and recipes \u2014that constituted real treatment from the Egyptian perspective. Outside the sw texts, treatments are intro duced by the simple titles such as rrt, \"what to be done,\"84 prt, \"recipe,\"85 or just kt, \"another.\" Frequently, titles of treatment are followed by a verb of elimination ( dr, sm, sf, etc.) + sickness/cause of pain,86 or by a of healing m, srw and sqbb ) + body part/wound.87 In the previous chapter, we saw that r mn can take either the body part or sickness as direct object. In treatment titles, we see that body part and sickness are treated very differently. That which is causing the body the pain needs to be aggressively countered and driven out; the body itself is meant to be cared for. The word prt is of key interest. According to MedWb, it refers to a finished mixed drug that can be administered in various ways.88 It also corresponds to the modern notion of prescription, which not only describes the actual medication, bu t also its individual components, its preparation and the instructions for applying it.89 Here we are reminded of the passage cited at 83 E.g., the stitching of flesh wound in case 10 or the applying adhesive plater to draw together a wound in case 47. For other examples, see Breasted 1930, 42. 84 Sometimes, rrt is used as a substitute for r.rk. MedWb, 83. 85 Wb. I, 549.1 -12 86 Cf. in the previous chapter with wekhedu as the object of elimination. 87 MedWb 284ff. 88 MebWb 289ff. See MedWb 290 for different ways of administration. 89 As indicated by a label such as t- m dmdt nt p rt ... \"the beginning of the scroll of recipes for...\" or t- m prt nt... \"the beginning of the recipes for..., \" it seems to constitute the very core of what Egyptian medicine is about. Another common, similar word is sp. However, sp is a broader term. Also, whereas prt is predominantly used in prescription headings, sp is mainly used in diagnoses. MedWb 740 -741. 115 the beginning of this chapter where Helen mixes into wine a drug that quiets all pain and strife .90 The Greek word used here for drug is pharmakon ,91 and i ndeed, prt survives into Coptic and is sometimes translated into Greek .92 It should be noted that v erb pr, \"to go around, to encircle\" from which prt derives, has a strong ritualistic association.93 From early on, many rituals and ceremonies involved walking around a place or object of interest for the purpose of purification and protection. The word also evokes cosmological significance, as it is associated with the sun god's cosmic ci rcuit.94 It is likely that the original etymological associations were mostly not evoked in ordinary uses of the word, similar to the way we do not usually think about the etymology of words that we use frequently. For a heuristic purpose, however, it is w orth dwelling on these associations, especially because they seem to illuminate the fundamental idea that undergirds the Egyptian understanding of the body and pain. Whether it is drunk or applied topically, prt affects the body of the person who uses it.95 The human body which prt affects can be conceived as a kind of place, analogous to a temple space that is being walked around or the cosmic circuit that the sun god travels. More specifically, just as the temple area or cosmic space, prior to encirclin g, is a place that has the potential to be disrupted, so an ailing body can also be conceived of as a place that has the potential to be disrupted. With encircling, the temple and the world become 90 A pharmakon which is n\u00eapenthes (, something like \"un -griefed\" = grief / pain / sorrow; + ), acholos (, without anger), which makes a forgetfulness (all in the adjective , epil\u00eathon -- + (l\u00eath\u00ea means \"forgetfulness\")) of all evils. I thank Emily Austin for breaking down the Greek terms in this passage for me. 91 It is a well -known w ord in the context quite relevant to Egyptology. Plato's Phaedrus (275a) and Derrida's Plato's Pharmacy Egyptian people script as a pharmakon . For the notion of pharmakon in ancient Greek, see Artelt 1968; Lloyd 1979, 44. 92 Ritner 1993, 54-55. 93 Ritner 1993, 57ff. Ritner notes that the magical ritual of \"encircling\" for purification is almost coeval with Egyptian civilization itself. See also Johnson and Ritner 1990 for a discussion of the meaning of prt in Demotic. 94 Ritner 1993, 62 n . 285. 95 It does not necessarily have to be a living body, though, since the embalming materials are frequently referred to as prt. 116 cleansed of the elements causing the disruption and a state of order is restored. Similarly, prt removes disruptive elements from the body and restores health. From here, we can proceed to make a finer distinction. Pain can be understood either as 1) a disruptive process or state in a place, or 2) elements or age nts underlying or causing such a process or state. The verbal uses of the pain words in the magico -medical texts seem to refer to the first kind; the nominal uses, the latter. This serves as a steppingstone to consider the \"magical\" aspect involved in trea ting pain, which is frequently overlooked when all the emphasis is laid on empirical observation and reasoning process.96 The contrast between science and magic becomes entangled over the presence and absence of pain, and its removal, in the human body. Because magic is often thought to be dealing with immaterial forces, such demons and various spirits, it becomes readily associated with the mental aspect of pain, while science, dealing with the observable and material world, becomes associated with bodily pain. Perhaps related, the efficacy of magical treatment is often described in terms of the underlying psychology. The vi ew is not without merit. For the purpose of this dissertation, however, I would like to steer away from that path. Instead, I would like focus on an aspect that is more readily intelligible, namely, the dramatic aspect that seems to inhere in Egyptian way of encountering with pain.97 When we try to visualize the process of driving out disruptive elements from the body, we can see all the ingredients for a drama.98 There is a spatial dimension (place) as well as a 96 Scholars have been divided over whether medicine and magic constitute two separate branches of thought and practices. For an overview, s ee, among others, Ghalioungui 1973; Ritner 1993; Pinch 2006, 133 -46. 97 Here, I am taking the cue from Moscoso's approach, briefly introduced in Chapter 1. The Egyptian model of driving out the disruptive elements in order to re store health can be thought of as a type of \"moment of rupture that demands reparation.\" Moscoso 2012, 6. 98 Cf. Moscoso 2012, 6: \"As concerns its dramatic nature, pain mobilizes all the elements of theatrical representation. The experience of harm has it s actors, plot, stage, costumes, props, scenography, and of course, its audience.\" 117 temporal (implied by the sequence of events ; before and after) dimension. There is also an antagonist (the disruptive elements). One element that is missing is the protagonist who will carry out the action. The physician steps in to play that role. The physician does not, however, enact this role de novo . In Egyptian tradition, various stories involving Horus, Re, Isis, Thoth, and others provide the template according to which physician can enact the drama against pain. As such, in a very general way of speaking, the physician's activity can be thou ght of as continued action here -and-now following the exemplary model embedded in those stories. Let me illustrate with specific examples. Cited below are three spells at the very beginning of Ebers. The placement of these spells at the beginning is signi ficant. It suggests that even without further specification, they are to accompany all subsequent prescriptions.99 This means that even if the actual mechanism by which the chosen method of treatment be non - magical, it is already placed within a magical fr amework, a form of encircling. These spells can also be viewed as an introductory note or a commentary of sort that sets the scene for the drama that is about to unfold: Ebers \u00a71 (1, 1-11) t- m r n w prt r t nbt nt s pr.n w r snf sw 99 Ritner 2001. Although Ebers was gathered over time, and the scribe(s) copying the texts may not have planned out ahead the organization of the entire text, at least when it was started, the scribe probably thought he knew what he was doing and placed at the beginning what he thought should be placed at the beginning of a proper medical treatise. 118 nk pw mrrw n r snf w d-mdw ft w prt r t nbt nt s ntt mr.t s-m n sp The beginning of an utterance for the application of a remedy on any limb of a man: I came forth from Heliopolis with the great ones of the great estate, the lords of protection, the rulers of eternity. Surely, I came forth from Sais with the mother of the gods, they having given me their protection. With me are formulae that the lord of all made in order to drive out the influence100 of a god, a god dess, a male dead, a female dead, etc., which are in this head of mine, in this neck of mine, in these shoulders of mine, in these flesh of mine, in these limbs of my body, in order to destroy101 the accuser, 102 the chief of those who cause to enter103 a disturbance in this flesh of mine, a dullness into these limbs of my body, as something that enters in my flesh of mine, in this head of mine, in these shoulders of mine, in (this) body of mine, in these limbs of mine.

If the language of the examination and diagnosis is focused on describing or referring after the facts, the language of the spells is pe rformative. Close reading of the content of the spells reveals that they are primarily about protecting and/or enhancing the efficacy of the physician's art.107 Each spell is to serve a specific purpose. The first one is for topical prt, the second one is for bandaging, and the third one is for drinking prt. Each draw on mythic episodes and divine utterances that are deemed relevant to the respective purpose. Notice that features such as the vocatives,108 rhetorical question,109 and various forms of repetiti on and parallelism,110 which are 105 On what the fire and water represent, see Westendorf 1970, 145 -151. He suggests that this is an abbreviation for \"I entered the fire, I came out of the fire; I entered the water, I came out of the water.\" Effects of certain pain are described in terms of fire and water. For instance, in the legend of Isis and Re, Re describes his pain saying, \" it is not fire, it is not water, though I feel colder than water and hotter than fire.\" See below. 106 Westendorf 1955, 383 -402. 107 Bardinet 1995, 39. See also Fischer -Elfert 2005. 108 E.g., st, \"O, Isis\" or r, \"O, 109 E.g., n-w tr s .nk, \"do you remember...\" 110 For the first and second spells, I have indicated them by indenting. 120 absent in the examination and diagnosis or in the description of the recipes, are pervasive in these spells. These formal features are important clues to understanding the mechanism by which the physician enacts the drama of healing. A type of analogical reasoning is at play here, which merits further explication. 111 In an analogical mode of thought, relationship between events is explained in term of formal similarity rather than causality: A and A' are related to one another, not because A caused A', but because A' resembles A. The cited spells exploit the formal si milarity between the mythic and the current events. For instance, as for the second spell, the event of Horus 's suffer ing evil serves as the archetypal event (A) to which the particular event of the patient 's suffering evil (A') can be likened. Once the my thic p arallel is located, the patient's situation is no longer understood as an isolated incident, but as a part of a meaningful pattern, embedded in a more universal, cosmic narrative .112 This in turn helps \"knowing\" the unknown, the outcome of the current suffering :113 when the patient's suffering (A') is interpreted in light of Horus' suffering (A), then the outcome of the patient's suffering (B') can be interpreted in light of the outcome of Horus' suffering (B), which means, the patient will be released from suffering.114 These mythical precedents are commonly referred to as historiolae , and they become ubiquitous in the healing spells of later times across the Mediterranean.115 As its literal meaning 111 The discussion here is informed by Tambiah's account of persuasive analogy in ritual performance. See Tambiah 1968, 175-208; Tambiah 1973, 199 -229. 112 Cf. Theodor 1987, 195 as cited in Frankfurtur 1995, 473: \"fit the specific human circumstance int o the larger pattern of sacred existence and power as known in the religion of the people.\" 113 Cf. Frankfurtur (1995, 466) notes that spells \"link between a human dimension where action is open -ended and a mythic dimension where actions are completed and tensions have been resolved.\" 114 What this shows is that while this type of knowledge is not bas ed on sense perception or empirical verification, it is not devoid of logic. 115 Faraone 1988, 284 provides a succinct yet lucid formulation of historiola as short mythological stories that provide a paradigm for a desired magical action. Cf. Faraone 2018, 2 29-236. Frankfurter 1995, 455 -476 is the most widely cited article for any subsequent scholarly discussion on the topic of historiola. The definition provided by Fritz Graf in Brill's New Pauly (2006) reads thus: ('Little story'). Modern term describing br ief tales built into magic formulas, providing a mythic precedence for a magically effective treatment. ... historiolas should not be understood as abridgments of 121 \"little story\" suggests, the story elements ar e usually kept short. Surviving from the Ramesside period, however, is a much longer example of historiola with a significantly developed narrative structure. Though not included in Ebers or Smith, this Ramesside anti -venom incantation is worth examining, as it fleshes out the experience of pain in an unprecedented way. The text is commonly known as the Legend of Isis and Re ,116 and it reads like a folktale, sharing features in common with literary narratives from the same period.117 Isis, wanting to know the secret name of Re, sets up a ruse to pressure Re to reveal the name himself.118 She fashions a scorpion out of clay, mixed with the spittle Re dribbled. Isis then strategically places the scorpion on the path Re routinely takes. When bitten, only Isis will be able to provide the cure.119 Indeed, the scorpion bites Re when he sets out for his daily solar journey the next day. The sun god's immediate response to the event is described thus: Isis and Re = P. Turin 1993 rto 3, 6 -8 nr wdf rf n w snb r m py m - tf The great god opened his mouth, the cry of his majesty, l.p.h. reached up to heaven. His ennead said \"what is it? what is it?\" his gods said, \"what! what!\" (but) he could not find his speech to answer concerning it. His lips were quivering, all his limbs were trembling, well-known myths or as ad hoc inventions, rather the narrator understands them as proof of an a ll- embracing order into which he integrates his rite. In Vedic studies, the term Legendenzauber has been used to refer to the similar concept. West 2008, 336 -339. 116 Papyrus Turin 1993. Now housed with catalogue number CGT 54501.

Names of deities were associated with source of power and knowledge and the topic of the hidden and ineffable name of the sun -god (Re and various syncretized versions of Re) was prevalent in Egyptian religious literature. 119 Spells against scorpion sting are co mmon. For a useful collection of scorpion spells, see Borghouts 1978, 51 -85 (nos. 84 -123); for scorpion stings amongst the community of workmen from Deir el -Medina (the same place P. Turin 1993 comes from), see Collier 2016, 100 -112. 122 The poison120 having seized upon his flesh, like the inundation seizing after him. It is an instance like this where the situation surrounding pain is spelled out in non -technical language that allows us to recognize pain more readily. Somebody screaming from pain and causing a great commotion is a scene familiar to us from everyday life. Notice, however, that the language describing Re's symptoms is reminiscent of that of the sw texts. A physician would catch symptoms such as quivering lips and trembling limbs during an examination. The last sentence is like a dia gnosis in that it first names the pathogenic entity and describes its action in a sm.nf clause and compares it to a natural phenomenon using m. Re's dramatic speech follows. There is a high concentration of the pain words, mn and mr, as well as of verbs of perception such as m, r and dp in the passage: Isis and Re = P. Turin 1993 rto 3, 8 -10; 13 -14 dm.n.tw t mr/ <nn> r st b nn m sw rt/ t s pw/ nn nbt r msw syw Something painful has stabbed me. My heart does not know it. My eyes did not see it. My hand did not make it. [I] cannot recognize it among any of the things that I have made. I have not tasted a suffering like it. There is nothing more painful than it. [...] something I do not know bit me. It is not fire; it is not water. My heart is on fire, (my) body is shaking, all (my) limbs are giving birth to a chill. 121 In the texts examined so far, we did not get to hear first -person account of pain. Here, through the voice of Re, t he experience of pain is described from the perspective of the one who is suffering pain. Representation of god's pain in such an explicit manner is not all that common in earlier Egyptian texts. Even in highly religious texts such as Pyramid Texts or Coff in Texts, 120 The word mtwt refers to any poisonous fluid. Notably, it refers to the poisonous semen of Seth in the mythic narrative of Horus and Seth, where Seth rapes Horus. Te Velde 1967, 37 -39 and 45. 121 The account is repeated once more in rto 4, 4 -5 with slight variations and more details: wn n m dft nn m st nn nn mw pw qbb.kw r mm.kw sdd rt nn smn nn gm pt w r r m tr n mw, \"I was bitten by a snake, unseen.

I cannot see as heaven beats down rain on my face in the time of summer.\" 123 incidents of violence and pain are presupposed and alluded to, rather than being reenacted. Finding his pain insufferable, Re finally reveals his true name to Isis. Only then, does Isis recite her spell for cure . The story concludes with the spe ll proper. It is noteworthy that the event of Re's healing following th is not incorporated into the narrative. Instead, the text switches to giving an instru ction on the attendant ritual act and pharmacological recipe \u2014all written in red ink\u2014along with a vignette of the image required for the ritual : Isis and Re = P.

(As for the remedy by) the plant is scorpion plant, ground with beer or wine, to be drunk by the one who has a scorpion sting. A legitimate method, (worked) a million times. I would like to suggest that a crude yet i ntuitive way of describing the effect of having an extended narrative such as this would be comparing it to the sense of \"being transported\" people often experience when reading a story or watching a drama. Like a drawing or a statue, a narrative is a form of representation ( mimesis ), and just as there always exists an inherent gap 122 The names of the deities are not written in red ink. 123 On the significance of licking, Ritner 1993, 93. 124 between the thing being drawn and the drawn thing, so there is between the world being narrated and the narrated world. One could imagine how t he greater the degree of resemblanc e between the two worlds would result in the readier experience of being transported .124 The narrative representation of Re's experience of pain facilitates the transportation , because the patient is already undergoing the pain of the scorpion sting , just like Re . In fact, with Re's account of pain in first -person, it could even appear as though the god's pain and my pain are one and the same. By the time Isis recites her spell, then, the two worlds have merged so seamlessly that it is as though Isis i s no longer reciting the spell for Re, but for the patient. That the event of Re's healing is not incorpo rated into the narrative makes much s ense in this light . It is the event of patient's own healing that serves as the conclusion proper to the narrative. Pain's relation with narrative will be considered in depth in the next chapter. *** So far in this chapter, I have examined the ways in which pain is framed in magico - medical texts. Overall, there is no particular focus on painful sensations in various medical situations as recorded in Ebers and Smith. Be it in illness or injury, pain is primarily conceived of as an objectively assessable state; only occassionaly does pain as felt by the patients receive attention. From the language of the sw texts, especially the texts regarding examination and diagnosis in particular, we see that pain is being understood in terms o f physiological processes or pathological conditions susceptible to empirical observation and explanatory generalization. The language employed in medical examination and diagnosis is largely drawn from daily life and natural phenomena (measuring grains, m olten copper, urine of sheep, and so on). The degree of knowledge concerning human physiology and pathology, of course, is not advanced judging 124 Cf. the so -called suspension of disbelief. 125 by the modern standard, but the fundamental principles do not seem all that different from those employed in mod ern medicine. The ways pain is approached in the treatment stage, however, seem to diverge from our own. It is not uncommon to see pain being identified with \"supernatural\" forces such as demons and malevolent spirits. Through the agency of the physician, remedies and incantations alike become charged with a force that can drive out these forces . Here we see that Egyptians regard situations surrounding pain as a type of reality that can be actively negotiated or manipulated. The language employed in treatm ent is reminiscent of that employed in the political and religious spheres. For instance, similar sets of vocabulary are used for describing pharaoh's dealings with foreigners and for a physician's dealings with pain. 3.3 Pain in the Context of Pharaonic Medicine The kind of understandings of, or attitudes toward, pain examined in the first section resist being neatly captured into a coherent framework that is readily available to us. This in large part has to do with the fact that the way Egyptians conceive of medicine (assumptions, beliefs, ideas that undergird medical knowledge and practices) is very different from the way we today conceive of medicine. For instance, there is an idea deeply ingrained in the modern mi nd that science and magic do not \u2014or should not \u2014go hand -in-hand. Ancient Egyptians, in contrast, did not seem to have viewed science and magic as mutually exclusive, but complementary.125 On a related note , medical anthropologists have pointed out that there are two fundemental assumptions on which modern Western medicine rests \u2014the autonomy of nature and the autonomy of individual \u2014that are not shared by other medical and healing systems around the world: 125 Cf. Ritner 2001. 126 In Western medicine, nature (biology to practitioners) is opposed to spirit; it is autonomous from human consciousness (subjective experience); each of its parts is atomistic, independe nt from the whole; and it stands not only independent from culture but prior to it. Furthermore, nature is a realm separate from morality and society . Nature, so isolated is regarded as universal. It is not dependent on the parameters of space and time. Na ture-biology is the basis for truth itself... The individual is a sovereign being, a distinct unit, prior to society and culture and autonomous from them...Individual orientation is as much part of biomedicine as it is of western culture. Sickness is residen t in the individual, in physiology, and diagnosis and therapy focuses exclusive gaze on the individual body. Suffering is the private response of the subject , and as long as that subject is competent, the moral responsibility of the physician is limited to the individual sufferer.126 In light of this, the discussion of the current chapter would benefit greatly if provided with an account of Egyptian medicine: the context in which magico -medical texts were compiled and transmitted, and in which the understan dings of pain examined above were embedded and operated as a part of coherent medical discourse. Given the limitation of space and scope, it is not feasible to provide a comprehensive history of Egyptian medicine. I will rather attempt at a succinct accoun t that is specifically tailored to show with evidence a distinct orientation of Egyptian medicine. At the end, I will return to discuss how the provided account contributes to the understandings of pain in Egyptian medicine. 3.3.1 Magico -medical Texts an d Centralization of Knowledge In the later Old Kingdom, the Egyptian bureaucratic and administrative system becomes more complex and better described through increasing use of titles, including those of physicians. This suggests that physicians functioned as part of a highly organized bureaucratic and administrative system. The titles of various high -ranking physicians with elaborate tombs in the Memphite region are known from the 5th Dynasty.127 The Old Kingdom biographical 126 Kleinman et al. 1992, 8 -9. Italics mine. The original passage has many in -text citations, but they have been omitted here. 127 Ghalioungu i 1983, 64. 127 inscription of Weshptah provides a glimpse into this trend.128 A vizier and chief architect to Nefarikare (5th Dynasty), Weshptah is visited by the king and his retinue (among whom include the lector priests and physicians) at the construction site he has been overseeing. Suddenly, he suffers a stroke and falls unconscious. The king has a chest of old writings searched for a cure for Weshptah's condition. When the efforts fail, the deeply saddened king prays on behalf of Washptah and makes all arrangements for Weshptah's burial: His majest y had the royal children, the lector priests ( ry-hb) and physicians (wr swnw ) come along ... Then his majesty had the chest of writings brought ... illness(?)...They said to his majesty that he had lost consciousness... then the heart of his majesty felt very bad more than anything...[then his majesty] prayed to Re....129 As for why medicine was centralized so early on in Egypt, one is tempted to posit the practical reality of the pharaoh needing people to attend to his health: high-ranking physicians in the court are like the pharaoh's private physicians. But it also can be understood on cultural (or ideological) grounds, in line with the broader trend that developed toward the late Old Kingdom, when great efforts were made to c ompile massive bodies of knowledge by the pharaonic office. The reference to the \"chest of writings\" in Weshptah's inscription is valuable, as it represents the earliest historical reference to medical literature.130 Medical texts that are dated to thousand years after the incident narrated above would often include references to old chests of writings as claims of great antiquity.131 Not that this passage warrants taking those later claims at face value, 128 A mastaba tomb at Saqqara. A discussion of this text is found in Ghalioungui 1983, 73 -74. 129 Urk I, 42, 6 -17. For translation of the text, Strudwick 2005, 318 -319. 130 Breasted 1928. 131 For instance, a passage in Berlin Medical Papyrus 3038 15, 1 refers to the chest of writings dating from the First Dynasty: gmyt m s w swtw m as old writings in a chest conta ining documents under the feet of Inpw in Hm, in the time of the Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Sp t(y)...\" Wreszinski 1909, 33. A very similar passage is found in Ebers 103, 1 -2: m gmyt m sw r rdwy npw m n m n n -swt-bty Spty m-rw, \"...among that which was found in writing under the feet of Inpw in Hm. It was brought to the Majesty of King of Upper and Lower Egypt Sp ty.\" Wreszinski 1913, 213. Spty was the New Kingdom spelling of one of the names of King Dn of the First Dynasty. Hainline 2020, 190 n. 34 & 197 n. 49. 128 but the passage serves as an incidental witness of the way the royal court deemed medical knowledge as worth of being collected and preserved. The collection of medical texts was not an isolated phenomenon. The pyramid texts are attested for the first time in the late 5th Dynasty. Pyramid texts are a collecti on of mortuary spells of diverse origins.132 Also dating roughly from the same period is the Palermo stone, the earliest extant royal annals.133 Starting from the 1st Dynasty and down to the 5th Dynasty, it provides year by year accounts of important events. Putting things that had been scattered in various place s into one place is a form of imparting order.134 Scholars speak of centralization of knowledge during the late Old Kingdom as having established \"a model of order\" that was emulated in the centuries to come.135 The notion of order is important for the discussion of this chapter (as well as for the discussion in the following chapters). It may sound abstract at this point, but it is in reference to the notion of order - maat - that Egyptian understandi ng of pain can be best explained or accounted for.136Pain exists where there is a rupture in maat . It is what a person in pain lacks and therefore strives after. 132 Hainline 2020. 133 Schafer 1902; O'Mara 1979; Wilkinson 2000; Hsu 2010, 68 -89. 134 Not just symbolically but also practically. Compare, for instance, how much easier it is to study for the exams or do the taxes when all the notes or receipts are in one place instead of scattered all over the places. Having a strong centralized kingship which takes keen interest in collecting medical recipes would have been very advantageous for the development of medicine, because this amounts to building a huge central database that would remain relatively stable through the ages, making it easier to be accessed and transmitted. 135 Kemp 2006, 62. Cf. Assmann 1996, 63f. 136 Much ink has been spilled on the topic of maat . Baines (1995, 12) has summarized maat as \"both the harmonious cooperation which was projected as a social ideal and the constant struggle to maintain the cosmos against the forces which threatened it.\" The following description by Morenz (1973 [1960], 113) conveys the similar idea, but more comrephensively : Maat is right order in nature and society, as established by the act of creation, and hence means, according to the context, what is right, what is correct, law order, justice and truth. This state of righteousness needs to be preserved or established, in great matters as in small. Maat is therefore not only right order but also the object of human activity. Maat is both the task which man sets himself and also as righteousness, the promise and reward which await him on fulfilling it. Further on maat , 1997 & 2001. 129 3.3.2 Egyptian Medicine as a Pharaonic Institution In Egyptian thought, pharaoh is the fulcrum of the social and cosmic order. He is the prime recipient of gifts from the gods as well as the prime donor and patron to humanity and to the gods.137 This role or duty of the sacred kingship is enacted through various activities such construction o f temples, providing provisions for the dead (evident in the tp d nswt formula), conducting military campaigns, and so forth. My claim is that medicine needs to be understood in similar terms, as one of the various ways in which pharaonic duty of main taining maat was concretized. A relief on an entrance pillar in the White C hapel of Senwosret I at Karnak as seen in Figure 1 below illustrates the point.138 The relief shows a statue of the king placed before an image of the Imiut139 in the form of a sm scepter, within a kiosk.140 Outside the kiosk are three figures, each identified by the associated deity or the title of the office. The top two are wn- mwtf, \"pillar of Hermopolis.\"142 The pair represents two specific and complementary ritual competencies in domains in which sm priest and lector priest serve as ritual agents. 143 The third figure at the bottom bears the title wr swnw , \"great 137 Baines 2021, 82. Literature include: Moret 1902; Frankfort 1948; Posener 1960; O'Connor and Silverman 1995. For a s ummary of previous scholarship with bibliography, see Winnerman 2018, 7 -13. 138 The White Chapel is a small limestone bark shrine ( 6.8m x 6.5m x 3.8m), known for an exceptionally high quality of relief works. Its sixteen pillars (four interior pillars surrounded by a peristyle of twelve pillars) are decorated with raised reliefs on all four sides. The scene under question is carved on the south side of the pillar that is standing on the left (north) side of the western entrance. See Lecau and Chevrier 1 956-1969, pls. 1a and 13. 139 Literally, he who is in his wrappings ( my-wt). For a brief overview on Imiut , see DuQuesne, 2012.

Entrance Pillar of White Chapel of Senwosret I at Karnak (from Lecau and Chevrier 1956 -1969, pl. 13)145 The feature most relevant to the point I want to make concerns the orientation of these figures. Both the king and the three figures face away from the scepter, which means \u2014if we recall that this is on the entrance pillar \u2014 they face away from the interior of the chapel and toward the outside. This means that the knowledge and the benefits thereof are not being brought in to be 144 This does not mean, however, one and the same person cannot become proficient in several different domains. Dating from the similar period (12th Dynasty) is the graiffito at Hantnub left by Heryshefnakht who bears the titles of wr swnw , wb of magicians.\" Anthes 1928. 145 A high -resolution photo of the scene can be found in Arnaudies et al. 2015. 131 offered to the gods, but are issuing forth from the gods to the world, through the king, through the officials, for the benefit of the huma nkind.146 Not least significant is the fact that this particular chapel is associated with the sed -festival of the king. With the king's rejuvenation, humankind experiences renewal of the benefits as well. Related to the foregoing is a passage from Merikar e, the text that offers a deep reflection on the meaning of kingship during the time of chaotic circumstances.147 The passage occurs toward the end of the text and has been often cited in discussion on the place of magic and kingship in Egyptian society, wh ich are described as the gods' gifts to mankind: For their hearts, he shines; to see them he sails. He has raised for Himself a shrine around them, they weep and he is listening. He has made for them rulers from birth, commanders to sustain the back of the weak. He has made for them magic, as a weapon to resist the events that happen, watching over them, both night and day. He has killed the malcontents amongst them, like a man striking his son for the sake of his brother. God knows every name.148 The section is a continuation of the previous section, which has described the creation o f humankind as the flock of god: mankind is intimately cared for by the creator god and provided with all the things necessary to flourish in life. If the pr evious section is focused on the things belonging to the natural world,149 the current section is about the installment of \"cultural\" institutions. The language is full of affects and portrays these institutions in highly personal and 146 Cf. Bardinet 1995, 35 -36: \"Aupr\u00e8s du roi l'Art Ils agissaient au nom sur terre et seul garant, selon le devait assurer \u00e0 bienfait dieux qui animait les corps. La sant\u00e9 est donc avant tout un don du roi.\" 147 Merikare E135 -137. Parkinson notes (1997, 212) that text portrays the king as a \"troubled shepherd struggli ng to uphold order.\" 148 Translation here is based on Parkinson 1997. 149 I.e., heaven, earth, winds, plants and animals. 132 relational terms. The shrine is for people to come and weep; hereditary kingship is for protecting the weak; magic is to carry people through whatever vicissitudes life brings.150 While no direct reference to medicine is made, in light of medicine's close relationship with both kingship and heka , and in conjunction with the kind of portrayal that medicine receives in the relief discussed above, the passage invites us to reflect on the perception of medicine in classical Egyptian thought. As a part of pharaonic institution and pr actice, therefore, it was probably inevitable that Egyptian medicine's rise and fall be tied to the rise and fall of pharaonic kingship. The autobiographical inscription of Udjahorresnet provides an illuminating witness.151 Udjahorresnet's career spans over the late 26th Saite dynasty and the first Persian period.152 The inscription recounts his deeds under Cambyses and Darius I, which in essence, were to ensure the continued interaction between humanity and the gods with the foreign rulers in the office. The greater portion of the inscription is devoted to recounting his career during the reign of Cambyses. Among the many titles he bears is wr swnw , the title conferred to him by Cambyses.153 The passage relevant to current discussion comes from the portion where Udjahorresnet's recounts the restoration of the \"House of Life\" commissioned by Darius I: His Majesty King Darius commanded me to return to Egypt....in order to restore the departments of [...] the Houses of Life ( pr-n) after they had fallen into ruins. I placed 150 The relationship between kingship and magic is reinforced by parallelism: r.nf nsn qw [m] st s - r.nf nsn kw r w r n pryt rswt [ r] s gr m hrw 151 Known as the Vatican Naophorous; Vatican Museum cat. 22690. Transcription, translation and commentary of the full text is found in Posener 1936, 1 -29. Partial translation and commentary in Gardiner 1938; Further discussion and bibliography of the inscription in Lloyd 1982 and Baines 1996. 152 The inscription therefore provides important historical source for understanding the dynamics between the Persian rule and the Egyptian traditions. The Greek sources (Herodotus Persian rule in Egypt as oppressive. The Udjahorresnet inscription is one of few sources which suggest that things were not exactly the way the Greek sources portrayed. 153 Throughout the text, wr swnw is the most frequently evoked title, and unlike other titles, the event of being granted of the office of this title is specifically narrated in the biographical section. 133 them in the charge of every learned man in order to teach them all their crafts. His Majesty commanded that they be given every good thing in order that they might fulfil their a ssignments. I equipped them with all their ability and all their equipment which was on record, in accordance with their former condition. His Majesty did this precisely because he understood the effectiveness ( t) of this art, to revive all those who are under sickness, to commemorate the name(s) of all the gods, their temples, their offerings and the conduct forever.154 Typically, the \"House of Life\" is understood as referring to the temple scriptorium, the institution for scribal learning.155 In this spe because of Udjahorresnet's title as wr swnw , scholars have tended toward interpreting it as an institution specifically related to his office, a medical school of a sort.156 The wording of the last sentence of the passage merits closer analys is as it features Udjahorresnet's own characterization of the institution: r.n mf nn tp-nrsn sm bsn t The function of the of art ( mt tn ) associated with the institution is spelled out in two parallel r + s-causative clauses: to attend to the sick; to perpetuate the names and worship of the gods.157 The parallel relationship between the two clauses reveals that the restoration of pr-n is not exclusively for promoting medicine. In fact, given that the second clause is much longer and has t in it, the non -medical function appears to be what Udjahorresnet is more intent on foregrounding. The wording of the main clause in which these two clau ses are embedded needs to be considered as well, for it allows us to see the continuity in the entire narrative where the restoration of pr-n is meant to be seen as but one in the series of restoration of other institutions 154 Posener 1933, 21 -25. 155 For the pr-n, \"house of life,\" refer to bibliography in Lazaridis 2010, 8 -9. Refer also to Monkhouse 2008, 23 - 57, especially its Table 1, which lists all the known attestations for the pr-n. 156 For instance, Gardiner (1938, 158) fills in the lacuna (represented by the square brackets in the excerpt) with \"the department(s) of the Houses of life dealing with medicine (lit. acting as a physician).\" That there survives a famous episode of Darius' d ealing with Egyptian physicians in Herodotus has led some scholars to link this passage to the contemporary history. 157 Cf. Posener's comment p in 1936, 24. 134 that do not have much to do wi th medicine. If we are to take the nominal sm.nf seriously here, the reason why Darius I made this restoration is precisely because he understood the effectiveness158 of the art associated with this institution.159 The wording here contrasts with r.n mf nn r rd.n sf, \"his majesty did this precisely because I had caused him to perceive...\" that constantly punctuates the account of the restorations made under Cambyses.160 The difference in wording could be explained by several different factors,161 but the general impression borne here is that unlike Cambyses, who constantly had to be \"nagged\" to do the right things,162Darius was somehow capable of doing the right thing on his own. Despite the contrast, the repetition of r.n mf nn r is enough to impart the sense of continuity over the different episodes in the inscription. Let us reconstruct the story arc. Elsewhere in the same inscription references to a nn, \"turmoil\" are made.163 During the time of the turmoil, Udjahorresnet acts virtuously towa rd his neighbors, typifying the model of an ideal Egyptian.164 He climbs up the ladder in the new administration and, with great persistence and patience, initiates the ignorant foreign ruler into Egyptian customs and beliefs. At Udjahorresnet's bidding, the cult center of Neith at Sais165 is restored: the foreigners are driven off from the temple area, 158 On the meaning of word(s) throughout the text, see Lloyd 1982, 169 n.10. Lloyd translates this t in this line as \"usefulness.\" He translates w in other lines as \"beneficial powers,\" deviating from the scholars who had translated the word as \"splendor.\" It is worth noting that the root of has a strong association with magic. Sometimes w is more appropriately translated as \"magical spells.\" See Ritner 1993, 30 -35. 159 According to Diodorus Siculus (I, 95.5), Darius I is said to have studied theology with Egyptian priests. Klotz 2015. 160 In lines 23, 26 and 30, following the line numbers first assigned by Posener. 161 For instance, it could be a reflection of changes in P ersian policy. References in both Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus reflect a tradition hostile to the rule of Cambyses II in Egypt. 162 As such, this serves as a precursor to the relationship between native priests and Ptolemaic kings in later times. Cf. Mende s stele ( CGC 22181; Sch\u00e4fer 2011, 250 ) reflects efforts made by the native priests to explain maat and rituals to Ptolemy II. 163 Posener (1936, 19 and 169) understands it as referring to a political disorder. Lloyd (1982, 177) specifically understands it a s \"the Persian invasion as an eruption into Egypt of the chaotic forces which were believed to pose a constant threat to the preservation of the ordered universe, and which it was one of Pharaoh's prime tasks to keep in check.\" 164 Cf. the discussions on mr and qsnt in Chapter 2. 165 Cf. the first spell of Ebers above. 135 the sanctuary is cleansed and re -staffed, and rituals are reinstalled. As Baines notes, the deeds described can be seen as Udjahorresnet embodying the essenti ally royal role of setting order in place of disorder.166 Once the temple is restored, then comes the restoration the temple scriptorium, one of whose functions included attending to the sick. The restoration of pr-n is meaningful , at least from Udjahorre snet's perspective, not primarily because it allows to attend to the sick, but because it signifies the restoration of the order, one of the consequences of which is restoration of health to the sick. Dating from the roughly same period as Udjahorresnet i s the famed ethnography of Egypt by Herodotus.167 Herodotus' enthusiasm and high esteem for Egyptian medicine (and for Egyptian culture in general) notwithstanding, he does not seem to grasp wherein the t, \"effectiveness,\" of Egyptian medicine lies. His a ccount of Egyptian medicine is that of an essentially \"etic\" kind.168 Diodorus Siculus a few centuries later similarly understands Egyptian medicine from the contemporary Greek perspective: For the physicians draw their support from public funds and admin ister their treatments in accordance with a written law which was composed in ancient times by many famous physicians. If they follow the rules of this law as they read them in the sacred book and yet are unable to save their patient, they are absolved and go unpunished; but if they go contrary to the law's prescriptions in any respect, they must submit to a trial with death as the penalty, the lawgiver holding that but few physicians would ever show themselves wiser than the mode of treatment which had bee n closely followed for a long period and had been originally prescribed by the ablest physicians.169 166 Baines 1996, 92. In particular, the general thrust is remarkably reminiscent of the restoration stela of Tutankhamun. 167 See, among others, Lloyd 2002, 413 -435. 168 Herodotus' comments on t he Egyptian practice of purgation and the high degree of specialization among Egyptian doctors are found in Histories II, 78 and 85. It is interesting that while Herodotus himself does not make explicit connection between Egyptian medical practices with ot her ritualistic practices, these accounts are nevertheless found near each other. For instance, II, 78 talks about the number and antiquity of written records in Egypt; II, 83 -84 talks about calendar and divination, and from II, 86 and onwards on burial pr actices. Herodotus' etic account of Babylonian medicine is also interesting. Histories , I, 197: \"Having no use for physicians they [the Babylonians] carry the sick into the marketplace; then those who have been afflicted themselves by the same illness as the sick man's, or seen others in like case, come near and advise him about his disease and comfort him, telling him by what means they have themselves recovered of it or seen others recover.\" This, in turn, offers an indirect glimpse into the institutional context of Egyptian medicine at the time Herodotus was writing. 169 Diodorus of Sicil y1.82.3 as cited in Ritner 2000, 107. 136 To be sure, Diodorus is not explicitly criticizing Egyptian medicine,170 but the passage has nonetheless been cited in the past for decrying the conservative nature of Egyptian medicine compared to more forward -looking and scientific Greek medicine.171 Setting the issue of historical accuracy of the account aside,172 it makes one ponder why this particular practice of Egyptian medicine caught Diodorus' attention. He seems to think it odd that punishment for medical \"malpractice\" is decided based on wheth er physicians followed the old rules, regardless of the mortality of the patients. That this would appear odd t o him, I would like to suggest, could be indicative of the difference between the ways in which the Greek s and Egyptian s conceived of their respe ctive medicine.173 It is possible that for the Greeks, medicine was defined primarily in terms of its instrumental use for saving individual lives.174 For the Egyptians, however, in light of Egyptian medicine's long history as a pharaonic endeavor for mainta ining maat , it is possible 170 In fact, Bourke (2012, 12) sees this passage as an implicit approval: Diodorus displays a certain degree of objectivity in his presentation of Egyptian medicine, describing the organisation of this medicine rather than judging it. However, we note an implicit approval of this public and traditional medicine. The remuneration of doctors from public funds serves the interest of the patient, since he is treated for free when he is away from home. The need to respect t he written tradition when applying treatment is justified by the wisdom of the lawmaker, who balances the result of a long tradition established by the best doctors and the unpredictable individual competence of each doctor. Aristotle in the fourth centur y also mentions the Egyptian doctors' obligation to conform to the law: \"In Egypt, doctors have the right to alter their prescription only after four days; and if one of them alters it earlier, he does so at his own risk.\" Aristotle, Politics 3.15, 1286a 1 2-14 as cited in Bourke 2012, 12. 171 For instance, Von Staden (1989, 4) explains the reasons for such conservatism: The amalgam of magic, law, and empiricism that characterizes the medicine of the Pharaohs might partially account for the extraordinary stab ility and inertia of Egyptian medicine... as late as the second century A.D., Egyptian pharmacology is still associated with magic spells and incantations, which indeed are richly represented in Pharaonic medical papyri. When medical theories and practices a re supported and sanctioned by ritual, by belief in magic, and by priesthood, they can become relatively immune to the revisionary processes that tend to be associated with scientific growth. When, in addition, medical practices are frozen and protected th rough codification and punitive legal sanctions, as they were in Egypt (e.g., by means of death penalty for physicians who violated codified therapeutic prescriptions, according to Diodorus), the odds against significant change rise considerably. A thorou gh critique of von Staden's view is provided by Ritner 1989. 172 For reliability of Diodorus' accounts of Egypt, see Africa 1963, 254 -258. 173 Of course, there were different schools of medicine among the Greeks, each with its own principles and methodologies. By \"Greek conception of medicine,\" I therefore do not want to imply that there was only one kind of medicine among the Greeks nor every G reek thought about medicine the same way. 174 In addition to highly effective empiricism, figures like Plato stressed the need for medicine to be supplemented by a a logical method grounded on \"true reason.\" See Nutton 2004, 57. 137 that even down to the Ptolemaic period, the physicians viewed their task of attending to the sick individuals as a part of pursuing the collective, or cosmological good , maat . By and large, the vitality and efficacy of Egyptian m edicine was powerfully and intimately linked to the past. 3.3.3 Medicine, Maat and Pain In the two preceding sections, I have tried to show how Egyptian medicine, h aving been institutionalized by the central kingship from early on, did not operate as an independent body of knowledge and practice, but in tandem with other bodies of knowledge and practices \u2014be it ancestral worship, religious festivals, mortuary rituals , etc.\u2014that were considered integral for the pharaoh's maintenance of order in the world. It then seems reasonable that , in order to arrive at a cohesive understanding of the Egyptian conceptualizations of pain as articulated in the first part of the curren t chapter (3.2) , we keep Egyptian medicine's orientation towards the pharaoh and maat at the forefront. In this section, I would like to provide a brief account of how this distinct orientation of Egyptiann medicine towards maat and the kingship is intimately related to the Egyptian cosmology , and delineate the role of the physician as an enactor of maat . It should be born in mind that maat signifies the pattern for the orderly working in all aspects of existence (cosmological, ecological, moral, political, etc).175 It is significant that Egyptians did not think the world to have always existed, or as somet hing that came about on its own. In Egyptian thought, the world came about from a deliberate act of an agent: creation by the god(s).176 In the E gyptian creation account, maat refers to \"the pattern of existence that was 175 See n.136 above. 176 The E gyptian account(s) of creation is diverse and complex. Refer to, inter alia, to Allen 1988 for further. Broadely speaking, three strands of accounts can be identified, based on the place of origin. The first, most widely known is the Heliopolitan account t hat describes the process of creation in terms of the \"genealogical relationships\" among the Enneads. Here, it is Atum, often syncretized with Re in both the PT and CT, that serves as the principal creator. The second account is referred to as the Memphite Theology, because in this account, it is the Memphite god Ptah that serves as the creator god. According to this account, Ptah creates the world via speech, and for this reason, it has been frequently compared to the biblical account of creation (as outli ned in the book of Genesis and 138 both established and first enacted\" in the beginning ( sp tpy ).177 Regularity can be observed in the ways in which sun rises and sets, the Nile floods and recedes or the seeds sprout and grow, because they are imprinted with maat.178 Since i t was based on this regularity as an expression of maat that allowed the Egyptians to make calculations and predictions, we could say that maat was what made \"natural science\" possible in ancient Egypt.179 In light of the fact that Egyptian medicine works within (or according to) maat , and that maat includes the knowledge of nature, it should not be surprising if Egyptian medicine's approach to pain includes the knowledge of nature as well as a form of inductive reasoning based on empirical knowledge. From individual to individual, certain regularity (physiology and anatomy) would have bee n observed. Against this regularity, it was possible for irregularity to be studied, and this is what the physicians seem to be doing during the examination when they take note of patient's symptoms. Now, a lthough maat includes the knowledge of nature, it is not fully contained/limited by it. From this follows, Egyptian medicine is not limited by the knowledge of nature either. In Egyptian account, maat is something that has to be constantly enacted. Although religion, magic, rituals, etc., are often concei ved of as the domains of knowledge and practice that oppose natural knowledge in modern thought, in Egyptian view, they are vital to humanity's proper and effective engagement with natural knowledge as they provide the means to enact maat . On this the Gospel of John). Finally, the third, Theban account features Amun (\"he who is hidden\") as the principal deity responsible for creation. According to Allen (1988, 60 -61), the Theban account seves as an answer to the questi on of ultimate causality...Amun is the Egyptian conceptualization of the First Principle, the ultimate cause of creation...the Egyptian concept of Amun is that of a transcendental creator: the ultimate cause who existed before, and independent of, his creation . It should be noted that in Egyptian thought, these accounts are not mutually exclusive of one another, but complementary. 177 Allen 1988, 57. 178 The regularity could of course be disturbed from time to time, but occasional disturbances do not mean that t he order does not exist. In fact, one cannot even conceive of the thought that something is disturbed or irregular, unless one first has an idea of what it is like for things to be not disturbed or regular. 179 Here, by \"natural\" or \"nature,\" I simply mean that which is subject to empirical observation and verification. 139 note, it is noteworthy that the Egyptian creation account accords central significance to heka , the force or power by which the creator god \"animates, compels and protects\" the creation.180 In Egyptian view, the body suffering from pain and illness, as an instance of a rupture in maat , very much calls for heka by a capable and legitimate agent. The agentive role of the physician who enacts the drama of treating pain was already mentioned in 3.2.4 above. It has been also mentioned that the phraoh serves as the princ ipal enactor of enactor of maat took on dramatized forms of display imitating after the gods, especially Horus's contending against Seth. Owing to this connection, Bardinet proposes to interpret the myth of Horus and Seth as an \"explanatory schema\" for the physicians' sch Seth \u00e9tablir l'ordre, \u00e9 pour \u00abGrand divinit \u00e9 (le pr \u00eatre joue le \u00e9 de auteur ind \u00e9pendant.181 According to Bardinet's account, as treating pain involves dealing with dangerous forces, the 180 Ritner 2005. See also Ritner 1993, 17 -18 and 23, especially n.23 where he says \"...magic in Egypt is viewed as a force (like \"life\" or \"strengt h\") which is consumed and permeates the body but never as a tangible, material substance.\" I wonder if the notion of heka as understood by Ritner has some overlap with the notion of qi (which is often rendered into English as \"energy\" or \"vital force\"; it is a central principle that underlies the eastern Asian medicine as well as martial arts) in eastern Asian thought and practices. In any case, it maybe helpful to think of heka as a sort of battery and relationship between heka and maat using the following analogy. A watch with a fully charged battery works in the way it is supposed to, as an accurate indicator of time (i.e., according to maat ). Eventually, when the battry runs out, the watch stops working properly (i.e., rupture in maat ); in order to make the watch work properly again, the battery has to be recharged. As the watch does not charge itself, an external agent equipped with the proper knowledge and power needs to step in to charge the battery (i.e., restoration of maat ). Cf. Te Velde 1970, 84 -85, where the relationship between maat and heka is also discussed. 181 Bardinet 1995, 44. Cf. ibid., 37: \" Il con faire conna itre ceux -ci dans tout le pays.\" 140 physician has to to rely on, not just bureaucratically, but also symbolically and substantively on the pharaoh, who, in Egyptian account, is the archetypal enactor of maat. Put differently, physician themselves are not themselves independent agents of healing; it is only the king who serves as the \"true\" agent.182 3.4 Conclusion This chapter considered pain in the context of ancient Egyptian medicine. Overall, pain is understood in reference to a disruptive processes/state or elements involved therein instead of in terms of painful sensation. The first part of this chapter examined pain in magico -medical texts. At different stages of the medical encounter, different kind of attitudes towards pain by the physicians and healers could be observed based on types of language used. The language in medical examination and diagnosis is non -exclamatory and descriptive, largely drawn from daily life and natural phenomena. In this stage, pain figures as an object of empirical observation and explanatory generalization. The language emplo yed in treatment is reminiscent of that employed in the political and religious spheres. Here, pain figures as an object of negotiation and manipulation. That the Egyptians would view pain as a physiological process (object of science) and a force to be c ontended with (object of ritual/magic) does not readily make sense from the modern perspective. In the second part of the chapter, I delineated the institutional and cultural matrices 182 To be sure, Bardinet qualifies the statement by adding : \"Bien entendu, cet aspect th \u00e9orique ne doit pas par de grand renom a leur niveaux, est une constante ret rouv\u00e9e par ailleurs.\" But the at the end, he also \u00e9tait pas uniquement formel.\" Bardinet 1995, 44. 141 in which Egyptian medicine is embedded so as to show that the Egyptian m edical discourse and practice regarding pain are actually highly coherent. In light of Egyptian medicine's distinct orientation towards the pharaoh and maat, I suggested that Egyptian medical understanding of pain could be viewed in terms of a rupture of m aat (or resulting from a rupture in maat) and Egyptian practice of treating pain in terms of doing maat . While it is difficult to find a conclusive systematic formulation that spells out the relationship among all the elements that underlie the Egyptian m edicine, it is still possible to see that Egyptian medicine had an epistemological and institutional underpinning that is quite distinct from the way medicine is commonly conceived of today. 142 CHAPTER 4 Pain in Egyptian Literary Narratives 4.1 Introduction In this chapter, I explore the relationship between narrative and pain in Egyptian thought by turning to the selection of Middle Egyptian and Late Egyptian literary narratives.1 The perspective taken for this chapter is, as befitting of the narrative genre, narratological, and I start my analysis by examining the ways in which pain as an event is integrated to the plot.2 Studying pain at many removes can make one prone to reify pain and treat it as an abstract concept. Considered pain as a part of a plot, however, pain can be approached more concretely, as the purpose/function of literary narrative is to simulate an event in such a way that the audience can experience it. My goal in this chapter is precisely to bring to the fore the experientiality of pain. The relevant concept in my critical readings of the narratives in this chapter is Mikhail Bakhtin's chronotope. Literally meaning \"time -space,\" it refers to \"the intrinsic conn ectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature.\"3 The chronotope materializes otherwise intangible and abstract categories, temporal and spatial, by means of linguistic representation, thus conjuring an image that can be observed in the mind's eye.4 We 1 For the distinction between literary and non -literary, Quirke 1996; Jay 2008, 2 -7. 2 For the definition of narrative, I here adopt the one by Genette, \"the representation of an event or a series of events ,\" because this definition, however minimalistic, brings out the core distinction between story (event) and discourse (representation). Explicitly positing discourse as a separate category allows to tease out various elements that mediate the presentation and perception of the story (temporality, mood, etc.), which facilitate formal analysis of narratives. For an overview of the other definitions with bibliography, see Ryan 2007, 22 -35. Simply put, the story is what is told ( histoire ), and the discourse is how the story is told ( r\u00e9cit). The distinction was first forth by the French narratologist Todorov 1980 [1966] and and was later widely adopted by others, such as Chatman (1978) and Genette (1980). The story -discourse distinction grew out of the structural ist tradition but closely related to the Russian Formalist tradition as well. Cf. Shklovsky's fabula and sjuzhet . See Pier 2003, 73 -97 for an overview. Note that the Aristotelian distinction (as adopted and explicated by Fo rster 1927) between story and plot ( muthos ) only partially overlaps with the structuralist distinction. For an overview of the dichronic affinities among the ancient and modern theories of narratives, Liveley 2019. 3 Bakhtin 1981, 84. 4 Bakhtin 1981, 250: \"The chronotope makes narrativ e events concrete, makes them take on flesh, causes blood to flow in their veins. An event can be communicated, it becomes information.\" 143 tend to think of the world represented in the story as quite independent of the world inhabited by the audience: this is the function of fictionality, after all; the fictional world is not as real as the world I live in. Bakhtin's notion of chronotope, however, challenges the distinction between the worlds inside the text and the world outside the text. For Bakhtin, the chronotopes are interpermeable, and he attributes this interpermeablity to the faculty of cre ative human agency: [t]he work and the world represented in it enter the real world and enrich it, and the real world enters the work and its world as part of the process of its creation, as well as part of its subsequent life, in a continual renewing of t he work through the creative perception of listeners and readers . Of course, this process of exchange is itself chronotopic. 5 In our discussion of Isis and Re in the previous chapter, we saw how the narrative mediates the way between the mythical world and the patient's world , so that they would even appear to converge. The convergence depends on establishing some kind of sameness (analogous relationship). I suggested that it is like the patient being transported into the world of the myth, and Re's pain and the patient's pain serve as the point of contact that facilitat es this movement. In the literary narratives, too, pain serves as the point of contact between the story world and the reader's world. The difference, however, is the directionality. Unlike in healing incantations \u2014 where the patient is already in pain, and the story of the pained deity is conjured up to \"match\" the pain of the patient \u2014in literary narratives, the audience has to come to match the character's pain.6 Various literary devices \u2014different forms of parallelism and repetition, framing devices, and p atterns of indexicals \u2014are employed to facilitate such transportation/chronotopic exchange and my analysis in this chapter shall focus on the interplay of these devices. After I present my textual analysis, I will return at the end of the chapter to present some implications of the patterns emerging from the representation of pain in the Egyptian literary narratives. 5 Bakthin1981, 254. Emphasis mine. 6 The phenomenon is also known as narrative empathy. On narrative empathy, see Keen 2006, 207 -236; Hammond and Kim 2014, 1 -18. 144 4.2 Pain in Middle Egyptian Literary Narrative Texts Three Middle Kingdom literary narratives \u2014The Eloquent Peasant , The Tale of the Shipwrecke d Sailor , and Sinuhe \u2014are among the best known and most studied texts.7 They have a roughly similar plot structure in which the protagonist leaves home and faces an obstacle that causes pain in one way or another. But the painful experiences also serve as opportunities to explore new roles, such that at the end of the narrative the protagonist returns home, having undergone some (presumably positive) changes. Though sharing in this rather simple and straightforward plot structure, they differ from one anoth er in terms of narrative strategies they employ,8 which affect the way pain is fleshed out in each text. 4.2.1 The Eloquent Peasant The story of the Eloquent Peasant is set in the Herakleopolitan period , but the text is generally accepted to have been composed in the early to mid -12th dynasty . The fact that this classic of Middle Egyptian literature survives in multiple manuscripts, which is rare for Egyptian literary materials, suggests that the text must have enjoyed a great popularity and was extensively circulated.9 The Eloquent Peasant shares many features with the so-called literary laments .10 What distinguishes the Peasant from the other laments is the frame story within which the main 7 On Middle Egyptian narratives, refer to, among others: for a diachronic account of the development of Egyptian literature in relation to literacy, Baines 1983, 572 -599 and Baines 1999, 17 -41. On different types of Middle Kingdom literary genres, Parkinson 1996, 297 -312. For a socio -historical account of Middle Kingdom literature with the special emphasis on the performative context, see Parkinson 1999, 63 -82. Parkinson's 2002 volume provides a comprehensive surv ey of the theoretical issues. For the history of specifically the Egyptian narrative literature, Jay 2016, 19ff. 8 Comprehensive study of the grammatical forms and narrative frames of these three texts are found in Jay 2008. My analysis is builds upon that work. 9 Parkinson 2012, 1. 10 For this reason, sometimes the Eloquent Peasant is grouped together with other laments under the category of Wisdom literature. Since the laments be dealt in the next chapter, in this chapter, I will mainly focus on the narrative features of the text. 145 speaker's speeches are embedded. The frame story of the Peasant presents the journey and travail of the main speaker in a straight forward and sequential fashion, using a simple, impersonal language . To briefly summa rize the main plot: a peasant is robbed by a provincial officer on the way to the capital of Egypt and tries to seek justice by petitioning the higher official with his eloquent speeches. His case is deliberately left unanswered, however, because the impre ssed pharaoh and high official want to hear more of the peasant's eloquent words. A total of nine petitions ensue, which make up the bulk of the text. Unlike the simple narrative hitherto, the embedded petitions employ a higher stylistic register character ized by specialized vocabulary and rhetorical devices and expound on a single theme \u2014the nature of maat \u2014in an episodic and cyclical manner. Also, being a mixture of accusations, charges, laments, demands, and reflections,11 they are charged with \"the urgent pragmatic passion,\" which prevents the text from \"being a listing of rhetorical tropes but instead provides a passionate meditation on appearance and reality.\" 12 If the frame story narrates the peasant's pain, the embedd ed petitions enact the peasant's pain. At the end of the ninth petition, the frame story returns, where the peasant's case is finally heard and answered. The juxtaposition of the simple frame narrative and the high rhetoric of the embedded petitions impart s a distinct flavor to the stylistics of the text as a whole; it also adds depth to the experience of the peasant's pain.13 Let me elaborate. Pain occurs toward the end of the first bookend of the frame story. According to Parkinson, the transition from th e frame story to the petitions \"is carefully staged in the gradually evolving dialogue between the peasant and the 11 Blumenthal 2004, 2 -7. 12 Parkinson 2012, 8 13 The juxtaposition of the two gives the text a remarkably similar feel to the Hebrew Book of Job. 146 villain.\"14 What disrupts this otherwise smoothly staged transition is the swift sequencing and phrasing of the events directly leading to th e peasant's pain: Peasant B1 5 3-56; R 11.2 -11.5 .n t n ryt rf Then he (Nemtinakht) took for himself/on his own behalf a branch of green tamarisk against him. Then he pummeled his (the peasant's) every limb with it, his donkeys having been seized and taken into his (Nemtinakht's) estate. So, this peasant wept15 very greatly, because of the pain of what was done to him. Note the first two main clauses with the .n + s m.nf construction. The use of .n + s m.nf in Middle Egyptian narratives functions to set the plot in motion.16 In the Peasant , the relative scarcity of this construction makes this usage stand out and signals the particular relevance for the development of the plot.17 That the construction is used twice in a row without anything intervening between them (like a parallel circumstantial sm.nf) creates a swift tempo, which contrasts with the relatively s lower tempo hitherto. It also serves to separate the two actions (taking the tamarisk branch and pummeling the peasant with it) instead of characterizing the second action as a direct result of the first. The action expressed in the second .n clause (pummeling) is instead linked with the action expressed in the following parallel circumstantial clause (seizing of the donkey).18 As Collier notes, \"the separation of the two components of the 14 Parkinson 2012, 4. Cf. Ibid., at 44, where he says the dialogue between the peasant and Nemtinakht preceding the beating scene \"prepares the audience for t he subsequent discourses.\" Note, Parkinson's use of \"narrative\" and \"discourse\" is different from Genette' usage mentioned in n. 2. By \"narrative,\" Parkinson means the frame story and by \"discourse,\" the petitions. 15 Parkinson (2012, 54) notes that weepi ng is the usual fate of a spurned petitioner, citing an example from Neferkare and Sasenet. A petitioner ( sprw ) from Memphis goes to court to present his complaint but is unable to do so because of loud music. As a result, he leaves r rmyt r wrt, \"weep ing very loudly.\" x+2, x+14. The transcription and translation of this text is found in Posener 1957, 125 -131. 16 Jay 2008, 30 -31. 17 Ibid., 32. 18 Technically, nm wf sq r sptf can be taken as two parallel circumstantial clauses ( nm wf and sq r sptf). Here, I am considering them as one, because sq r sptf is not directly parallel to the previous .n clause, but only indirectly by virtue of being parallel to (or the result of) nm wf. Also, unlike nm wf, which is passive but still 147 beating gives dramatic effect and constitutes the highlight of th is section of the text with the seizure of the donkeys treated as a further element of the punishment.\"19 The wn.n clause that follows tells of the peasant's pain and weeping. Unlike the .n construction, which is marked for narrativity, the constructi on used here \u2014the sm.nf construction \u2014expresses past -tense action in a more neutral way.20 The phrase n mr n ryt rf, \"because of the pain of what was done to him,\" is significant. This prepositional phrase here relates back to the events just narrated (the perfective passive participle sums up the beating and the confiscation of the donkey), and with n, creates a causal link between those events and the peasant's behavior (i.e., it answers the question: why did the peasant cry greatly?). More signific antly, the clause as a whole anticipates and stages the rest of the texts. The use of the word mr here is worth further consideration. Prakash mentions this particular passage and argues that the word mr encompasses both physical pain and emotional suffer ing.21 While this may be correct, I suggest that what is more fundamental to the peasant's pain here is the experience of evil and injustice, which cannot be reduced to either the physical or the emotional level. Moreover, it is not only the peasant \u2014the characte r of the story \u2014who is subject to the experience of evil, but the audience is also subject to the experience of evil. Although the audience does not immediately share in the physical or emotional aspect of the peasant's pain, owing to the privileged vantage point available to the them (unlike the peasant for whom the beating and the seizing of his donkeys happened out of nowhere, the audience \"saw it coming\" as they have been following the development of the plot; they are also informed by their conveys an action, sq r sptf does not convey an action but a state resulting from the action from the previous clause. So together, it counts as one action. 19 Collier 1996, 535. 20 Jay 2008, 35. 21 Prakash 2020, 109: \"Because he has just been beaten, on one level, the mr of the peasan t certainly seems to include his physical pain from his injuries. But he was also deceived, and his donkeys were stolen. Thus, his pain may be more than simply physical. It could also encompass a degree of emotional anguish and distress.\" 148 own experien ces in the real world where the similar kind of injustice is not uncommon), they can still \"participate\" in the peasant's pain. In order to demonstrate the foregoing point, it is necessary to look more closely to the development of the plot and see what kind of information has been made available to the audience at this point in the story. Approximately halfway between the beginning of the frame story and the scene of the peasant's beating, Nemtinakht is introduced. Until this point, the story has been de tailing the peasant's trip from Wadi Natrun to Herakleopolis. The introduction is brief, simply identifying his name, his father's name, and his boss's name. Without further ado, the story continues: Peasant B1 20 -24; Bt 22 -27; R 6.7 -7.3 d.n nmt .nt pn mf w n s byw r bf df n sp nb mn w nw n s t pn mf And this Nemtinakht said when he saw the donkeys of this peasant that are pleasant to his heart, saying \"would that I had any effective image/amulet so that I may steal the belongings of the peasant with it!\" These brief lines suffice to portray Nemtinak ht as evil, laying bare his motivation,22 which lies at the nexus of cognition and emotion: first he sees the donkeys; he finds them desirable23; he gives his passion a more intentional form by contemplating the means to fulfil his desire.24 In the ensuing narrative, Nemtinakht puts into public action what is in his heart.25 He traps the innocent peasant on wt nt rm nbt, \"a public road (lit. \"the road of every man\").\"26 Insofar as the legal 22 Several Middle Egyptian texts elaborate on the theme of unknowability of what is in the heart. See Parkinson 2012, 229 for the list of examples and discussion. It is through the literary artifice of juxtaposition of a narrative statement and an inner speech that the audi ence is able to know what is in Nemtinakht's heart. 23 The word byw, a stative form used as the predicate of the virtual relative clause modifying the peasant's donkeys; is not well attested and its meaning is a little ambiguous. Traditionally translated as \"pleasant\" and \"desirable\" but it can also mean \"selfish,\" which suggests that the usage here may have a negative connotation. 24 The heart as the potential source of evil recurs throughout the poem. Parkinson 2012, 40. 25 Cf. Man and Ba 105-106: wn seizing his fellow's things.\" 26 According to Parkinson (2012, 44), the reference here suggests that the peasant is an everyman and is a first indication of empathy between him and the audience. In order not to step on the sheet, the peasant 149 technicality is concerned, Nemtinakht's act is warranted,27 but given his evil intention, his action is unambiguously evil. The dialogue exchanged between the two further reveals the viciousness of Nemtinakht (B1 32 -52). Parkinson notes that the mood in this exchange, while amusing, \"trembles on the brink not only of seriousness but of great sorrow.\"28 On one hand, it is amusing because it is at this point that the peasant starts displaying his skillfulness in fine rhetoric, utterly inconceivable in Egyptian society at this time. On the other hand, it is serious an d sorrowful because the injustice suffered by the weak and the innocent is indicative of a world out of balance. By the time the peasant is beaten, robbed, and weeping from great pain, the audience, too, has become a witness to the evil. Taken against the text as a whole, the passage where the peasant's pain is mentioned occurs towards the very beginning. But in terms of the plot of the frame story, it is already at the climax, and everything from here on is ordered toward the resolution. The driving force of this resolution is mdt nfrt , \"the good/beautiful speech.\"29 The importance of fine rhetorical skills in overcoming pain is hinted at in the dialogue immediately following the peasant's beating and weeping: Peasant B1 57 -61; R d.n nmt-nt sgr d k rk n t tm sb nrk 27 The path the peasant and his donkeys are p assing by is very narrow. B1 25 -27: ns pw n ws s pw qn.n f r sw n dw w wt r mw kty f wt r m, \"it was a narrow one, it was not a broad one. Only to the width of a skirt, did it extend. Its one path was under water, while its other path was under barley.\" Nemtinakht has his servant fetch a sheet from his house and spreads it over the path. In orde r not to step on the sheet, the peasant walks his donkeys close to barley field, and as a result, .n m.n w m nn w rf m bt nt m, \"one the donkeys filled his mouth with a clump of barley.\" B1 40 -41. Nemtinakht seizes the donkey as the price for the barley. 28 Parkinson 2009, 55. 29 Cf. Parkinson 2012, 8. According to Uljas ( 2013, 2) , mdt nfrt refers to any skillful use of language i n general, perhaps having the connotation of \"acculturated\" communication. Its negative counterpart is mdt b nt \"bad/evil speech\" or mdt st \"wretched speech.\" 150 So, Nemtinakht said, \"Don't raise your voice, peasant. Look, you are (going) to the harbor of the L ord of Silence.\" So, the peasant said, \"Will you beat me, will you rob my property, will you even seize the complaint from my mouth? O Lord of Silence, may you give me back my things, then I will not cry and alarm you.\" To the weeping peasant, Nemtinakht responds with a threat of death,30 but the peasant retorts ironically.31 The verb form of nm is a subjunctive or an emphatic nominal, posing a rhetorical question. Unlike the beating and seizing of the donkeys, which has been done to him against his will, he cannot or will not be deprived of his speech. The Lord of Silence whom Nemtinakht evokes to allude to death, is used by the peasant to address Nemtinakht and to express his determination not to budge (i.e., the only circumstance in which I will be silent is when I get my things back). Since Nemtinakht does not return the peasant his goods, the peasant does not remain silent, and goes on to make his petitions. Since the rhetoric of the laments with which the embedded petitions share many features, will be considered in the next chapter, here I will only briefly look at them, mainly in terms of the effect created by juxtaposition with the frame narrative. Before each petition, a narrative statement is inserted to indicate the following is an nth petition by the peasant. If the frame story narrates the peasant's pain in an objective way, the embe dded petitions enact it in a personal manner . We saw a similar kind of juxtaposition in Isis and Re in the previous chapter. From the bottom of his heart, the peasant cries out that he is suffering and is in need of help: Peasant B1 100 -102; R 16.5 -16.8 ( at the end of the first petition) dr sr mk w tp.kw p w mk w m nhw32 30 On the frequent association of silence and death, see Assmann 1984, 199 n. 38; Brunner -Traut 1984, 759. On the different connotations of silence employed in this line, Parkinson 2012, 55 -56. Parkinson notes that the sense of irony is added here because this last thing is something that cannot be taken away. 31 This line is loosely cited centuries later in the Letter of Menna (oChicago OIC 12074 + \"you are in the situation of the man who says \"you kill <me>, my donkeys being taken away, and lament being robbed from my mouth.'\" Gardiner 1923, 25. 32 R has hw instead of nhw. 151 Repel need, look I am burdened. Take account of me. Look, I am in loss. Peasant B1 167 -170; R. 26.3 -26.833 (at the end of the second petition) dr sir-n-mw nb mk w r He who repels the need34 of all on water, look I am under the way of boatlessness. Anchor of all who drown, rescue the shipwrecked, for I am anguished at your very side! Even in these brief lines, instances of the poetic ingenuity \u2014which exemplifies the said mdt nfrt of the peasan t\u2014abound. As can be seen, repetition and parallelism operate not only between proximate lines, but over larger chunks. B1 100 -102 at the end of the first petition is paralleled by B1 167 -170 at the end of the second petition. For instance, though dr sr is repeated, in the first instance it is used as an imperative; in the latter, it is used as a part of an epithet with the following genitive phrase: sr-n-mw. Or, consider tp.kw and r mtnw w. These do not seem to be directly parallel to one anothe r at first besides carrying the general meaning of hardship and helplessness. Visually, however, the determinative of tp shows a man under a load or bearing a load; r as a preposition means under but is often used to mean carrying or possessing. The association of the two words is frequently employed in royal inscriptions when describing foreigners bringing tributes to Egypt.35 The more immediately relevant example is found in Man and his Ba : w tp.kw r mr n-gw q-b, \"I am burdened under the need for want of an intimate friend (lit. \"he who enters the heart\").\"36 Together with the repetition of the narrative statements, poetic parallelism like this establishes an additional link between the petitions, 33 In R, the parallel is more obvious: dr sr [] mk w tp.kw [(m?)] nw hw \"Drive off [my] need, look I am burdened [with] woe. Look, I am in your hand, that you may judge me. Look, I am in suffering, recuscer of the weary, rescue [me] in the vicinity of your side. Parkinson 2012, 144. 34 Cf. mr in Chapter 2. 35 E.g., Karnak inscription of Seti I: r tsn nb [p] r pssn, \"bearing all their goods, loaded on their backs.\" OIP 107, Pl. 32, 15 -16. 36 Man and Ba 127-128. 152 imparting unity and coherence to the text as a whole. As a result, the pain and suffering of the peasant is reinforced and intensified. As the petitions progress, the themes grow increasingly broader and deeper. From one particular incidence of suffering that befell the peasant, a universal im plication is drawn. It becomes clearer that this is not just about the peasant's pain \u2014physical and/or emotional \u2014alone. The peasant's speech ultimately targets at the fundamental cause of his pain: disruption of maat brought about by the abuse of power by t hose in authority. In addition to giving a vivid and poignant description of the reality of disruption of maat , the peasant uses his speech to pour out his heart: Peasant B1 306 -309; B2 32 -36 w grt t m.t() b tp(.w) pr s m t n ry ngt pw m dn t mw s sw wn r r mdt Now my belly is full, and my heart is laden, coming out of my belly due to its state , it is the breach of a dam, whose waters have flown out, when my mouth opens to speak. In addition, through speech, the p easant intends to move Rensi, the direct recipient of the petitions, to action: Peasant B1 347 -353; B2 81 -87 n sf.n k n mn.n k n sksk.n dbw n mdt tn nfrt prrt m r wr sy sy w sy gmw.tw kft s sbw s r m You do not pity, nor suffer, nor yet destroy. You do not repay me for this perfect speech which comes from the mouth of Re himself. So speak maat , do maat for it is mighty, great, enduring. As its revelation is found good, it attains the blessed ness. Notice how the peasant's speech is likened to the word of god (mdt tn nfrt prrt m r n r sf). The 153 peasant makes it clear that he is more than complaining about of his individual pain: he is speaking maat by presenting his case as empirical evidence, so to speak, for the threat that Egyptian society is under when those who are supposed to uphold maat fail to do so. Elsewhere, the expect ed Egyptian norm is that one remains calm, \"free of hea t\"37; being agitated by someone else's words is seen as a vice. But here, failure to heed and act upon the peasant's speech would be equivalent to another failure to uphold maat .38 Rensi, if he is inte nt on upholding maat at all, must respond. At the end of the ninth petition, the text returns to its frame narrative. Rensi finally takes action, passing the peasant's petitions on to the pharaoh. The pharaoh is deeply moved by the peasant's words. It is said of the peasant's words: wn.n nfr st [ r bf] ntt m t pn r rf, \"they are more beautiful [on his heart] than anything in this entire land\" (B2 131 -132).39 The conclusion to the story \u2014Nemtinakht is punished and the peasant is rewarded \u2014 affirms the validity of maat . 4.2.2 The Shipwrecked Sailor Featuring the motif of shipwreck, The Shipwrecked Sailor is one of the earliest examples of its genre in the hist ory of literature.40 The tale is simple in style and tone, making it look more \"oral\" than other Middle Egyptian literary texts.41 Scholars have noted that the text derives from 37 Cf. the related ideal of the silent man, grw. 38 Cf. Assmann 2002 [1996], 118 notes the significance of eloquence and the \"downward responsibility\" of the ruler: The assertion of political was no longer a matter of apodictic self -glorification, but was ac complished via a 'rhetoric of motives' that justified political measures in terms of responsibility. This rhetoric was by no means purely formulaic or symbolic. The ruler being aware of his 'downward' responsibility and accountability; he reigned not by fo rce but by the power of the word. 39 A parallel is found in Kagemni 2, 6-7. Gardiner 1946, 32, pl. xiv. For more examples of this expression with comments, see Parkinson 2012, 311. 40 See Morrison 2014 which presents the comparative study of literary shipwrecks from Homer and Shakespeare to modern novels. The Egyptian Ship wrecked sailor is briefly discussed in his chapter 3. 41 Baines 1990, 57. It has been described as folktale -like, containing allusion to esoteric religious knowledge. Derchain -Urtel 1974. 154 the expedition texts.42 It is difficult to reconstruct the exact process by wh ich the expedition reports become incorporated into the part of belles lettres .43 The experience of travel readily lends itself to the quest structure, onto which various aspects of human life, including pain, can be superimposed.44 As can be observed in Greek epics or biblical patriarchal narratives, for instance, leaving home creates a disruption in the normal course of life. 45 Away from home, the self is called into question and it must contend with forces bigger than itself, suc h as fate, gods, and community, among others. The homecoming at the end of the story completes the quest structure. In the Egyptian context, coming home and being buried on Egyptian soil is a sine qua non for a happy life. Hence, a story of an Egyptian pro tagonist who leaves Egypt, suffers much abroad, and comes back to Egypt gives a concrete form to the quintessential Egyptian value of social order, maat .46 The quest structure is dynamically embodied in The Shipwrecked Sailor with its intricate story with in a story within a story structure. It can be represented as ABCDC'B'A'.47 A and A' 42 Enmarch 2011, 97 -121. Large -scale practice of state -sponsored exp editions were a major feature of state activity from the Early Dynastic Period, and the inscriptions that were left on rock faces and stelae at various sites outside the Nile Valley, such as Sinai, the Red Sea Coast, the Eastern Desert, and Nubia, reveal d iverse activities ranging from mining and trading to military campaigns. 43 According to Parkinson (2002, 60 -64), during the Middle Kingdom, there's a comparatively high degree of intertextual permeability between literary and monumental texts. According to Enmarch (2011, 99), \"it is reasonable to assume that a significant proportion of the country's administrative elite, not to mention a large number of peasants, would have had at least some experience of expeditionary life.\" Baines (1999, 34) suggests that there is a special value attached to narrating the experience of travel and adventures. This is as reflected in the Middle Kingdom appeals to the living: m mrr n mwtn... as you desire that your local gods favor you...reach (home) in peace and tell your expeditions to your wives...\" Sethe 1928, 88.21 -23. 44 On the underlying quest -structure of travel narratives, Moers 1999, 52ff. For the criticisms, see Quack 2003, 152 - 153; Fischer -Elfert 200 4, 414; Schipper 2005, 294 -296. 45 For theorists like Todorov, an element of disruption that challenges the status quo comprises the minimal requirement for a complete plot: \"L'intrigue minimale force l'\u00e9quilibre r\u00e9tabli; le second \u00e9quilibre est semblable au le s deux ne sont jamais identiques.\" Todorov 1968, 96. 46 Cf. Moers 1999, 51&53: the motifs of travelling and border -crossing in travel narratives serve as the metaphors for the transgression of Egyptian cultural norms. 47 Baines 1990, 67. On the different na rrative levels (using Genette's terminology), see Suhr 1999, 99 -100, & the diagram in 2016, 89; Vinson 2015, 417 -482. 155 represents the return of a sailor and his captain from a failed expedition, consisting mostly of the direct speech of the sailor. B and B' are the first -person narrative a ccount of the sailor's departure and return from the expedition that had taken place at some time in the past. C and C' continue the first -person narrative of the sailor but features the sailor's time on the island and the encounter with the snake. Finally , D is the first -person narrative of the snake. This D, which literally constitutes the core of the text, is the story of pain. Shipwrecked Sailor 126 -132 wn mf n pr.n r s nn w n m.ny nn w bsn .n mt.kw nsn gm.n st m yt wt I was with my brothers, children among them. We totaled 75 snakes, consisting of my offspring and my siblings, without I bringing to mind to you the little girl whom I brought by prayer. Then a star fell down, and those went up in fire because of it, and it happened while I was not with (them), (they) burned up, while I was not in their midst. Then I die d for them, I having found them as one pile of corpses. Finding your close kinsmen in a pile of corpses sounds horrifying . The snake says he \"died\" for them, which may be metaphorically taken as meaning extreme sorrow (obviously it is not literal, seeing that he is very much alive at the time of telling the story). But the word the snake himself uses to describe his experience is mr, \"pain,\" as evident from the lines immediately preceding the story (at the point of the transition from C to D): Shipwreck ed Sailor 124 -12548 rwy sd ry prw m w pn How happy is he who relates what he has tasted, something painful having passed. Let me then tell you something similar that happened in this island. 48 Note that at this point in the papyrus, the scribe switches from columns of text to horizontal lines. Allen 2015, 34. The reason is not fully known, but it may be related to the visualization of the framing of the stories. Note also that the text switches back to vertical columns at 177, two columns before the transition from B' to A.' 49 The form of sn can also be interpreted as the pro spective: \"so that the painful experience passes.\" Cf. Parkinson 2002, 190 n.59. 156 In addition to characterizing the experience as something painful, these lines serve as the thematic principle structuring the entire text. On the level of discourse (event of telling the story), the utterance of these lines precedes the telling of the pai nful event. On the level of the story (content of the story), however, it is an afterthought in which the snake is bearing witness to his past suffering. The snake's utterance of these lines is paralleled by the sailor's utterance of similar lines at the point of transition from A to B, where the sailor says: Shipwrecked Sailor 21 -23 m - s m.kw r b n t... Let me tell you something similar that happened to me myself. I went down to the mining region of the sovereign... The repetition here is not simply for the sake of repetition. The repetition of the same form that is used to recount the two disparate events establishes a link between the two events. Not only does form of the sailor's storytelling resemb le that of the snake's, but the stories told in each are similar to each other ( mtt ry) as well. To see how they are alike, we turn to the event of the shipwreck, which is narrated twice by the sailor, first in B, and then repeated almost verbatim in C: Shipwrecked Sailor 32 w rf wmyt nwyt mf nt m 8 n t n s .n dpt mt nt w ms n sp w m50 .n rd .kw r w51 n ww n w-wr A gale came up while we were at sea, before our reaching the land. The wind rose repeatedly, the water therein of 8 cubits. It was the mast which broke it for me. Then the boat died, those in it, not one of them survived Then I was put on an island by a wave of the sea. 50 The C version adds r w mk w r gsk. 51 The C version has .n() n.kw r w pn instead. 157 The penu ltimate line, .n dpt mt ntw im s n sp w m, \"then the boat died, those in it, not one of them survived,\" echoes the final line of the snake's story, .n mt.kw nsn gm.n st m yt wt, \"then I died for them, I having found them as one pile of corpses.\" The meanings of two lines are not exactly parallel. But, once again, the poetic function is at work: it is the formal similarity that carries over, which in turns forges a similarity in meaning. The repetition of the sense of \"death\" and \"one\" conveys the grief and loneliness resulting from the loss of the loved ones. The sailor, just like the snake, lost (or, at least he thought he lost) his peers. He is left alone, an experience like de ath. The likeness of the two events is further reinforced in the account of the sailor's first few days on the island: Shipwrecked sailor 41 -45 r.n hrw 3 w.kw b sr.kw m nw n kp n t qn.n wyt I spent three days alone, my heart being my only friend, lying inside the wooden cover, having embraced the shadow. Here, the imagery of death -like experience and solitude is intensified. Washed ashore on the island, the sailor survived, but only barely, like the snake. Parkinson sug gests the expression \"embracing the shadow\" probably refers to the state of unconsciousness.52 He is utterly alone (w) and the only companion ( snnw , lit. \"second one\") he has is his own heart. This, too, mirrors the snake's solitude, who had had no one bu t himself since the holocaust. Although the sailor's experience is never explicitly described as painful, by virtue of its being likened to the snake's experience, it is understood as painful. The pain constitutes the core of the story, but it does not exhaust the meaning of the story. The story would not have been told if it focused only on the painful experience itself. The 52 Parkinson 1997, 98 n.7. 158 story has come about only because the snake and the sailor chose to sd dpt.n f, \"tell what he has tasted.\" As in Peasant , where t he role of nfr mdt is foregrounded, here the emphasis is laid on the act of sd-ing in the face of pain, rather than on the final product. Pain may be inevitable in life, but you face it bravely by telling the story about it. There is even some joy ( rwy ) in this, when you see pain passing by. Parkinson notes: ...the thrust of the poem is that, since the whole cosmos - even the divine - is prey to disaster, all that one can do is to bear it bravely, attain a degree of self -realization and self-control, and 'v iew' one's experience without despair (there is much play with 'seeing'). The serpent's survival offers the audience some hope, which is embodied in the sailor's survival...In this survival, art has a role: the telling and retelling of misfortune enable peop le to overcome or to endure it.53 The appropriate response expected from the audience of sd-ing is seeing and listening. Although less obvious, another parallel to lines 124 -125 occurs at the point of transitioning back from B' to A,' after the sailor ha s finished narrating his story to the captain: Shipwrecked Sailor 179 -81 m [...] mk nfr s m n rm See me, after I reached land,54 after I saw what I have tasted. Listen [...]55, Look, to listen is good for a man. The use of repetitions internal to the unit attests to the cleverness of the poetic architecture. The first couplet makes use of the nexus of the verb m \"to see\" + first -person pronoun twice. It first occurs in the main clause in the form of the imperative followed by the first -person dependent pronoun as its direct object. The nexus is followed by the compound preposition r-s. The second 53 Parkinson 1997, 90. 54 Allen (2015, 50) notes the sense of m is \"see how I have turned out,\" and the sense of r-s s t as \"after returning from my ordeal.\" 55 Allen 2015, 50 reconstructs the lacuna ty-; Baines 1990, 60, suggests [to me] or [to my speech]. 159 instance occurs in the subordinate clause as the object of the compound preposition r-s, in the infinitive form with the suffix pronoun. The second couplet uses of the verb sm, which, as in the first couplet, appears in the imperative and the infinitive. Externally, the relative dpt.n echoes line 124 in the snake's speech. The verb of which this relative phrase serves as object is m \"to see,\" which may not be seen as directly parallel (neither synonymous nor antonymous) to the verb sd \"to tell.\" verb sm, \"to listen,\" in the next column, the complementary association becomes clearer: pain is something one experiences ( dp), the story of which one can then recount ( sd) so that others can see ( m) and listen ( sm).56 The repetitive st ructuring leaves the text open -ended, which allows for more cycle(s). The audience who sees and listens to the story of pain can potentially be the teller of their own pain, which in turn invites yet others to see and listen, and so on. It is comparable to mise en abyme57 in that it motivates further reflexive duplication, but the potential of its actualization lies outside the text, in the future. Before moving on, I would like to point out how the mechanism of this tale bears a remarkable resemblance to t hat of historiola such as the Isis and Re discussed in the previous chapter. The serpent in the story represents a deity.58 That the serpent's experience of pain is a mtt ry to the sailor's experience of pain, which is then expected to serve as a mtt ry to the expereince of the internal audience (= the count) and of the external audience, is similar to the 56 Once again, the array of verbs of cognition and experience here is reminiscent of the passage in Isis and Re from the previous chapter. See P. Turin 1993 rto 3, 8 -10, 13 -14 cited in Chapter 3. Cf. Enmarch 2011, 104 -105. In the course of his discussion on the relationship between expediton inscriptions and the Shipwrecked Sailor , Enmarch cites the following passage from the inscription of Harwe rre and points out its similarity to the Shipwrecked Sailor 179-8 (Sinai no.90 in Gardiner, 97 -99): mn n m n w m.n r r.n mnt m, \"Do be downcast of face because of it! Look, Hathor can turn it to success - I myself have seen and done the like!\" In n.26, Enmarch notes that the juxtaposition of the verbs m and ry also occurs in medical literature. 57 Cf. Vinson 2015, 471 -482. 58 His body is overlaid with gold and eyebrows like lapis lazuli. 160 way Re's experience of scorpion bite is to serve as a precedence fo r the patient's scorpion bite. Also significant is that t he sailor tells the story of the serpent's overcoming pain and his own story of overcoming pain not merely for \"entertainment\" but to bring about a certain practical end, that is, to help the overcom e pain.59 This, too, is similar the purpose of reciting historiola: to bring about the event of healing in the patient.60 In both cases , the story of the experience undergone by the deity represents a model for the audience/patient to structure, or make sense of, their own expereince. 4.2.3 Sinuhe Sinuhe is unquestionably the best -known classic of the Middle Kingdom literary compositions. Written in the first half of the Twelfth Dynasty, the text has survived in multiple manuscripts copied as late as the New Kingdom period.61 The plot itself is simple: a royal courtier named Sinuhe flees from Egypt, lives in exile in the Levant, and returns home. But the poetic language and structure takes this simple story to a new level. The most notable feature is that it is stylized as a tomb autobiography. This has several important implications for the portrayal of pain owing to the features born out of the original interactional and social dynamics. 59 On the moralizing aspect of the story, cf. Baines 1990, 66: \" A reading in moral terms might seem forced because of the supra -moral and supra -personal character of these events, but it shou ld be retained, since the snake presents it explicitly in this light, as, by implication, does the frame for the entire text.\" Per aps related, perhaps incidental, it is interesting that both texts allude to the secret knowledge of the identity of the sun g od. It has been suggested that number the number of the total snakes present in the island before the catastrophe, seventy -five, is an allusion to the seventy -four forms of the sun god as enumerated in the Litany of Re. Derchain -Urtel 1974, 83 -104. These f orms form a restriced and sacred knowledge, just like the true name of Re alluded in Isis and Re. Baines 1990, 62 -63. 60 Here, it may be worth noting how Parkinson 1999, 74 -75 connects magic's function of \"encircling\" ( prt; on prt, see the discussion in the previous chapter) integral to the magical texts to the New Historicist's conception of literature as an instrument for containing subversive elements. According to him: ...the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor concerns the inescapability of unexpected disaster, and alludes to the ultimate ending, the destruction of the cosmos. This bleak information is contained in a neat series of tales within tales which is very reassuring to the reader...The audience of the Ta le can experience the uncertainty of reality, and learn of the cataclysmic end of the earth, but at a safe distance. 61 To date, five Middle Kingdom papyri, two New Kingdom papyri and twenty -five New Kingdom ostraca, all in hieratic have been found. See Allen 2015, 55 -56 for the description of the manuscripts. 161 We talked abo ut the centralization of knowledge in the previous chapter. Another important feature of the centralization was the centralization of tombs. The ancient Egyptian concept of a good and complete life included burial in a well -equipped tomb, which included a biography of the deceased. According to Baines, tomb biographies rose out of the highly performative context of the elite self -representation vis -\u00e0-vis the king and other elites in the \"fictionalizing frame of role-playing and performance.\"62 Inscribed in hieroglyphs, these texts are characterized by highly formal language and a formulaic compositional scheme, and their content is almost exclusively devoted to recounting the episodes of royal favor received by the deceased.63 The media on which the texts ar e inscribed \u2014parts of tomb architecture and decoration \u2014are closely bound up with the content of narrative, because the royal favors often consisted of some material or logistical help with the construction of the tomb. The Sinuhe narrative makes use of this frame. From the start of the narrative, it is made obvious to the audience that all the events are portrayed as being narrated from the perspective of a completed life. Though the events are told as they are happening to and experienced by Sinuhe qua protagonist, this same Sinuhe qua narrator knows that they are ordered toward the specific end goal, the tomb. Incorporated into the overarching autobiographical frame are the various sub -units which draw on a wide range of literary genres, such as historical annals, narratives of conquest and combat, encomia of the king, royal decrees, meditative prayers, and ceremonial lyrics.64 These units are interwoven into the plot -line and play a role in carrying the plot forward, albeit in a limited sense. The profusio n of genres imparts to the text an encyclopedic feel, which is particularly suited for fleshing out a full range of human experience, including, of course, pain. 62 Baines 1999, 24. 63 The early development of Egyptian biographies, see Stauder -Porchet 2017. 64 Parkinson, 1997, 21 -22. 162 Different genres employed throughout the text bring with them particular kinds of affects that are appropriate for the events that are being narrated or described. For instance, the story proper begins with the historical event of the death of Amenemhat I: Sinuhe R 5 -11 sbt 30 r rwty Regnal year 30, third month of inundation, day 3 The god's ascent to his horizon, Dual King Sehetepibre, going off to the sky, united with the sun -disk, the god's body mingled with the one who made it. The residence was in stillness, hearts in grief, the great double gate shut, the entourage with hea d on lap, the elite in mourning. With the use of the annalistic infinitive, followed by six parallel adverbial clauses all leaning on one w in the beginning, the mood created is somber and formal. The preposition m means \"in/on/with\" and conveys an ob ject in place. The grief is there but calm and under control.66 Compare this with the panic that Sinuhe responds with upon hearing the news: Sinuhe B 2 -4 ps b sn wy m t nbt nf {r} w m nfnft r n st dg r dt w mt bt r rt wt mws My heart became confused, my arms spread out, trembling fell on my every limb. In leaping I took myself off, 65 nyt here is a variation of nwt \"entourage,\" which is the meaning taken here. 66 Cf. Collier 1996, 542 takes note of the passage's what he calls \"lexical cohesion\": The mourners are characterized metaphorically by place ( nw) and metonymically by the Egyptian notion of the core of the human being ( b) reflecting a movement o f lexical cohesion from the outer to the inner. Moreover, there is a powerful evocation of centrality - the residence as the center of the kingdom and the heart as the center of human life. 163 to look for a place to hide, until putting myself between the two bushes, toward the path's making of its going. In addition to the vivid report on Sinuhe's reaction \u2014in both physiological and psychological terms r, \"to/until,\" indexes Sinuhe's disoriented movement: instead of staying put in Egypt, he is heading to the Levant. Another feature that the autobiographical frame grants is the immediacy of the presence of the narrator without the face -to-face context. As can be seen, in Sinuhe , this distinctive first - person narration is exploited to report not only the external events that happen to the protagonist but also his inner thoughts and sensations. This allows the audience to feel as though they have seen and know Sinuhe inside and out.67 The ensuing flight scene is of special interest bec ause the account of Sinuhe's topographical movement is constantly punctuated by Sinuhe's inner thoughts. By following this account, the audience is also able to follow Sinuhe's exterior as well as his inner journey: Sinuhe B 15 -23 rdt wt n mt hrw s n w .n t p.n ptn n.kw r w n w() ntb.kw mw d.n dpt mt nn st b sq w... My giving a path to my feet downstream: I touched the Ruler's Walls, made to bar the Asiatics. I crouched down in a bush in fear that the watchmen on duty on the wall might see. My making off at the time of dusk: At dawn I reached Peten, and landed at the island of the Great Black. Thirst fell and overtook me, so that I was scorched, my throat parched. I said, this is the taste of death. My lifting up my mind and collecting my limbs... 67 Cf. Suhr 1999, 95. 164 Although Sinuhe's life journ ey seems to be fraught with suffering and pain, it is difficult to isolate a specific event or definitive moment of Sinuhe undergoing pain in the text. Instances of Sinuhe's fear, grief, joy, fatigue, thirst can be explicitly pinpointed, but not that of pa in. In fact, though the word mr is mentioned twice in the text, in both cases it is not predicated of Sinuhe. Does this mean that Sinuhe does not experience pain? Quite the contrary. It would be hard to argue that he does not. In fact, Sinuhe's pain is the kind of pain that induces the audience to participate in a far more personal and intimate way than Peasant or Sailor . It is the pain of longing. Sinuhe longs; the audience watching Sinuhe too longs. To demonstrate how this is achieved, I start my analysi s from the middle of the text where two instances of mr bookend Sinuhe's duel with the hero of Retijenu. The duel marks the halfway point of the text and also the climax or turning point of the plot.68 The first instance of mr occurs right before the actual combat begins. It is said of those who have come to watch the duel: Sinuhe B 132 -135 ty nb m b n n-w wn ky n t rf Every breast smoldered for me, women and men were wailing. Every heart being in pain for me, saying, \"is there another mighty man who can fight for him?\" Here, the word mr is in stative with b nb as its antecedent, dative n with the first -person suffix pronoun, referring to the narrator, Sinuhe. The on -lookers of the fight have their heart aching for Sinuhe. The second reference appears after Sinuhe has won the duel. In the middle of Sinuhe's passionate prayer, he petitions a nameless god to have pity on him and bring him home: Sinuhe B 156 -162 nr nb wrt n tpk d w r nw 68 Cf. Hays 2014, 37. 165 smwn k r rd t mi bw wr w b m ptr wrt r bt t m t msk w mf m-m-s pw pr sp nfr d n tp rrf m t r smn pwy n sfn.n f bf mr n dqr.n f r n r st Any god who destined this flight, may you be appeased and put me towards/at home, surely you will cause that I see the place in which my heart spends the day, (for) what is greater than uniting my corpse with the land in which you birthed me in? This is \"help!\"69 so that a good event would befall, as the appeased god would grant me,70may he act as such to ennoble the end for (of?) the one whom he had afflicted, his heart being in pain for the one whom he had pressed to live in a foreign country... The word mr is again in stative and has bf as its antecedent, where the 3ms suffix pronoun refers to a god to whom Sinuhe attributes his life's fate.71 Whichever god is responsible for all this, his heart must be in a state of pain for Sinuhe. So, in both cases, pain is predicated, not of Sinuhe, but of those who are watching Sinuhe. But what is it about Sinuhe's situation that warrants this response from the watchers? After all, Sinuhe is successful. He has just beaten the Asiatic champion. He has Amunneshi's trust, is happily married with lots of children, and owns lots of cattle and possessions.72 But there is still a sense of something missing. In Peasant and Sailor, it is something that happened while being away from home that brought pain. In Sinuhe , it is th e very fact of being away from home that contributes to pain. Examination of the immediately surrounding passages reveals that Sinuhe is feeling homesick. A couple of lines prior to the first reference of mr, where Sinuhe has just heard the news of the cha mpion's challenge, he cries out: Sinuhe B 117 -22 nmn w m k n ww m r b ky dr hd sw k n wt ngw r m rf 69 This is an A pw sentence with the imperative m m-s, \"come after\" (Egyptian idiom for help) as A. See Allen 2015, 111 for further. 70 I took d as circumstantial, describing the circumstance of the previous clause, but it can also be taken as prospecti ve in parallel with the previous clause. 71 Contra Allen 2015, 111 where the translation \"may he act in such a way as to improve the end for one he has afflicted, whose mind is pained\" seems to suggest that pain is of Sinuhe's. 72 B 78 -97. 166 n w wn tw ptr smn dyt r w I am surely like a bull of the wild in the midst of another herd, whom the alpha bull attacks while the steer fastens on to him. Is there a dependent loved to the same degree as the chief servant? No bowman is allied with a reed -man. Who can fasten papyrus to a mountain? The rare emphatic particle like nmn73 and rhetorical questions all contribute to conveying Sinuhe's bitterness. He has been trying really hard to fit in to his new home, but is this what he gets in return? The day dawns for the fight, the champion had brought all the neighboring tribes against Sinuhe (B 129 -31). The locals are ganging up on one foreigner. That he is indeed a loner and an outsider is apparent to all who have come to watch the duel. It is in this context the first reference to mr occurs. Although the duel itself does not pos e much of a challenge to Sinuhe \u2014he wins it easily and ends up with even greater possessions and honor than before \u2014it has awakened in Sinuhe the existential awareness of being a foreigner, which makes him reassess his life in the Levant: Sinuhe B 149 -156 wr wr nw ----- sy n qr w d t n nfr pr ws st swy m ----- E A fugitive flees because of his surroundings, but my reputation74 is in the Residence; A creeper creeps for hunger, but I give bread to my neighbor. A man leaves his land for nakedness, but I have white clothes and fine linen; A man runs because he lacks someone he can se nd,75 but I am rich of dependents. My house is good, my place is large, but my memory is in the palace. The passage as a unit is marked off from the surrounding text by the framing spatial expressions 73 GEG \u00a711, 6. 74 Cf. Allen 2015, 109: \"the word is normally found in the expression mtt nt b or mtt b, denoting innermost thoughts or feelings.\" 75 I.e., messengers. 167 m nw in A and m in E. In A-D, the first half of e ach couplet delineates the state of disintegration or lack (designated A1, B1, etc.) As Allen points out, these lines can be read as a generalization, but also specifically applicable to Sinuhe's situation before he became settled in Retjenu.76 The second half of each couplet communicates the opposite, the state of wealth and abundance that Sinuhe is now inhabiting (designated A2, B2, etc .).77 E deviates from the pattern established in A -D. Here, too, the first half , E1, serves as a background against which the contrast in the second half , E2, gains its significance. But instead of the past lack, it is the current abundance that occupies the first half. E1, swy m , together with A1, mtt m nw, echoes back to the beginning of the text and expresses Sinuhe's longing for home. The deviation in E however serves the rhetorical function and conveys the longing more powerfully. Compared to the memory of the palace ( swy m ; E2), any wealth and abundance ( nfr pr ws st; E1) is as good as other states of lack (A1, B1, C1, and D1). And it is precisely here, immediately following this passage that the second instance of mr occurs. Now, if the bystanders and the nameless god are expected to feel pain for Sinuhe, the audience of the narrative (and the purported the visitors to the tomb) are similarly expected to have their heart mr for Sinuhe. The gamut of emotions that are mapped ont o Sinuhe's life journey evokes in the audience strong feelings as well, as Sinuhe's situation of pain appeals to Egyptian values. By Egyptian values, I mean the king and maat , and the longing for afterlife. Recall from the previous chapter how putting obje cts\u2014be they medical recipes or mortuary spells, their origins could be diverse \u2014into one central place is a form of imparting order. When 76 Allen 2015, 109. See also Stauder 2014, 174 -177 for illustration of how the very language employed i n the passage dynamically embodies Sinuhe's split identity. 77 Cf. A llen 2015, 109: \"an emphatic sentence in which a generalization in the first line serves as a background to the contrasting situation of Sinuhe in the second.\" The rhetorical structure here can be understood as a form of then - now structure which we shall discuss in -depth in the next chapter. 168 the king collects such objects in a central place, he imparts order and unity. And once imparted order and unity, only then, they find their true efficacy. So are the royal subjects. Being away from home ( nw) is akin to having one recipe or one spell found by itself: hardly useful ( , \"effective\" ). Most importantly, away from the king, one cannot have a proper burial, a perquisite to become , \"the blessed/transfigured one.\"78 This longing for \u2014both earthly and heavenly79\u2014 would have deeply resonated with the Egyptian audience, making the audience particularly receptive to Sinuhe's experience. 4.3 Pain in Late Egyptian Literary Narratives 4.3.1 Ramesside Literary Narratives Compared to the older classics, the stories dated to the Ramesside period are light in tone and humorous.80 Folktale and mythological motifs abound, and there are more characters and actions than in the Middle Egyptian narratives. The events are presented in an episodic manner81 and are told in the third person. The demarcation between the story and the narrative in these 78 Cf. B 191: sbt r m, \"passing to blessedness.\" 79 Cf. t, \"horizon.\" 80 If the scholarly discussions on Middle Kingdom literature have revolved around the functional context and intertextuality, the discussion on the New Kingdom materials have centered on the topic of linguistic register, which refers to a variety of language defined according to its use in social situations. The notion w as first introduced to Egyptology by Goldwasser (1990), and subsequently taken up by other scholars interested in pragmatics, such as Junge (2001, 18 -23), David (2006) and Polis (2017) among others. The language variety in which the Late Egyptian stories a re written is referred to as \"literary,\" when compared to the language of the contemporary documentary narratives. The existence of the variety was recognized as early as Hintze 1950 and 1952, and the distinction between the literary/non -literary language is systematically laid out in Groll 1976, 237 -46. By the New Kingdom, the Egyptian language had undergone significant transformations, and the varying responses to these linguistic changes across different sectors of society resulted in different language varieties (registers) of Egyptian. More specifically, after the linguistic innovation of the Amarna period, the documentary texts started being written in a form of language that conforms closely to the contemporary spoken language, while the monumental te xts (both non-royal autobiographical and royal inscriptions) continued employing (what they thought was, but in reality, a bastardized form of) Middle Egyptian. For more on the linguistic situation during the New Kingdom, see now Stauder 2013, 3 -55. 81 Bain es 1996, 60 . In particular, passing of time becomes the explicit marker of organizing the episodes. According to Jay (2008, 145), fronted temporal adverbials especially play a significant structural role in Late Egyptian stories in general , as they are use d very frequently and are often rubricized. 169 tales is obvious and rigid. In addition, it has been suggested that they lack the same level of self - reflection compared to the Middle Egyptian materials.82 Such features of the Ra messide literary narratives require us to adopt a different reading strategy when we look for representations of pain and examine their effects. From a structural point of view, Ramesside narratives are similar to Demotic narratives. Tait has observed that in Demotic narratives, emotions have a narrative aspect of signaling some sort of a shift or progress in plots.83 In other words, representations of emotions inform the audience of the relational dynamic between the characters and of the characters' motiv ations to action. My analysis below is informed by Tait's insight. I turn to the two longest and best preserved of all the extant Ramesside literary narratives: The Tale of Two Brothers and The Contendings of Horus and Seth . 4.3.1.1 The Tale of Two Brothers Preserved in a single manuscript of nineteen columns dated to the later 19th Dynasty, The Tale of Two Brothers features a highly entertaining plot that draws richly upon mythological and folkloristic motifs.84 The story op ens with an idyllic description of the life of Anubis and Bata, 82 Cf. Jay 2016, 36: \"while a deeper kind of psychologization has been identified in the earlier tales, static characterization tends to be the norm. Such static characterization may well be tied to Ong's psychodynamics of orality, for it conforms well to studies showing the d ifficulty of members of oral cultures have with self -analysis.\" 83 Tait 2009. More specifically, he observes that emotion expressions typically appear at the beginning of a new episode, in recognizable, largely fixed phraseology. Emotions expressions are l ike temporal expressions (a few days later, the moment x...etc.) and movement expressions (went up aboard, sailed and arrived). More on temporal and movement expressions in demotic narratives, Tait 2011, 400 -402; Jasnow 2007, 436. The particular emotion that Tait uses to demonstrate his point is anger ( r). In the text of P. Spiegelberg, for instance, the expression \"became angry like sea\" ( r subj. m-qty ym ) is used to refer to the characters' public displays of anger that is followed by the characters' ma king decisions and taking actions, which propels the story forward. Tait also includes to the category of emotions expressions such as tr, \"to become troubled,\" sby \"to laugh,\" bn-pwf gm p t wf n- mf ,\"he didn't know on wnf rf n sgp wf d, \"he opened his mouth in a great cry, saying...\" Jacqueline Jay (2016, 116) too briefly considers the role of emotions in Demotic narratives and notes that emotions associated with phrases such as wnf rf n sgp or f sgp provide a catalyst for further action. 84 BM 10183 or Papyrus d'Orbiney after its original owner. Since its discovery and early publication, the tale has received a wide attention from scholars because of the parallels with narratives of other cultures, like Joseph and Potiphar's wife. For the his tory of reception, see Hollis 1990, 16 -47; Wettengel 2003, 1 -16. 170 two brothers.85 The peace is disrupted when Anubis's wife unsuccessfully tries to seduce her brother -in-law. Fearing the repercussion of the incident,86 the wife sets out to drive a wedge betw een the brothers. The first reference to \"pain\" occurs when the wife fakes an assault by Bata: Two Brothers 4, 5-5, 10 (= LES 13, 9-14, 10) st t mt n pyf sn sn.t sm d(t).n s ws r pr nty qnqn.t n bw pys n- r tm rd t mw r rtf m pyf sr w bwpw s st r-tf w pyf kkw ws sr.t r r mdw m sm bn wn wf r rtf m sf Now, the wife of the elder brother was afraid because of the proposition she had made. Then she brought fat and bandages and she became like one who has been beaten deceivingly, out of intention to tell her husband, 'It was your yo unger brother who beat (me).' And her husband quit for his house in the evening in his daily custom, and he reached his house, and he found his wife lying down, being ill deceivingly. And she did not put water on his hand in his habit, she having not kindl ed fire before him, his house being in darkness, while she was lying down vomiting/spitting. And her husband said to her, \"who had words with you?\" Thereupon she said to him, \"no one spoke with me except for your brother...If you let him live, I am going to kill myself...because I am suffering87 (on account of) the evil proposition/plan that he was going to do yesterday! 85 Hollis 1990, 84 -88 for an in -depth discussion of the opening scene. 86 Adultery was punishable by death, the best -known example of which occurs in the second tale of the Westcar Papyrus. The grave consequence of adultery is also mentioned in mentioned in various Instruction texts. For specific examples, see Hollis 1990, 97 -98. 87 Wente 2003, 6 n.7 takes n as to mean \"to curse\" noting that the determinative of the verb (A2: a seated man with hand to mouth) favors \"curse.\" The verb n is commonly translated as \"to denotes from \"to recite (a spell).\" It, which can be used for the purpose of cursing, but probably doesn't have the similar semantic as that of the English \"to curse.\" The Egyptian word that is comparable to the English word \"to curse\" is the verb swr, Ritner 1993, 43 -46. Note, ni with A2 also occurs in a passage from the Doomed Prince (= LES 4, 9-10): l <bn> tw r nt rd.wy w r mt r pwyt m -dtn, \"if I were <not> hurting in my feet, I would proceed to leap up with you.\" Once again, Wente suggests an alternative 171 The section opens with an st clause, which not only provides the relevant information for the action in the following two main clauses (i. e. it explicitly states that it's out of fear that the wife does what she does),88 but also serves to tie the whole section89 together, by virtue of its predicate ( sn.t r p sm d(t).n s,\"was afraid because the proposition she had made\") anticipat ing the predicate of the very last main clause of this section ( r nt py sm bn, \"am suffering (on account of) the evil proposition/plan\" ).90 The first two main clauses, the initial form and the non -initial form immediately following it,91 tell of the wife's feigning injuries by applying fat and bandages.92 No pain -term examined in Chapter 2 occurs here, but the word qnqn , \"to beat,\"93 occurs twice. \"To distinct from \"to feel pain,\" and so is \"to be be aten\" from \"to be pained.\" For sentient beings like humans, however, translation, \"if I could but enchant my feet,\" saying that the restoration of a negative bn is uncertain and the determinative of the ver b favors \"to enchant.\" However, Wente's alternative translation does not make sense when the plot is considered. Here, the prince's speech is supposed to provide an explanation why he cannot go leaping with others at the moment. If the reason why he cannot go leaping now is because he is not able to enchant his feet, as suggested by Wente's translation, then when he finally goes leaping after many days, it should be because the prince can now enchant his feet that he could not before. How is that the prince is all of sudden able to enchant his feet? For something as major (in terms of having a significance consequence to the development of the plot) as acquiring a power to enchant one's feet, one would expect it to be explicitly mentioned in the story, but t his is not the case in our text. It simply says, after many days, the boy went leaping. I suggest what is implied in \"after many days\" is the prince's recovery from his feet pain from the long journey (reference to bandaging of his feet is made in 5, 10). Unlike developing a power to enchant one's feet, recovery from pain after many days of rest is a natural and common phenomenon and is more likely to be elided in narration without hindering the reader's comprehension of the plot. 88 This function of the pa rticle st remains the same in Middle Egyptian and Late Egyptian. Jay 2008, 187. More on the particle st with comprehensive bibliography, Jay 2017. 89 Note, the demarcation of the section is not arbitrary; nor is it just in terms of the content, in respect to the plot progression. It is formally marked by the fairly consistent and pattered use of the initial and non -initial sentence forms. See supra n.96. 90 This is comparable to the poetic device called the envelop construction discussed by Pardee (2012, 87 -90), specifically in relation to the plot progression in Ugaritic narrative poetry. 91 The distinction between initial and non -initial sentence forms was introduced in ern\u00fd and Groll 1993, 164 -168. Jay (2008, 160 -162 &167; also Broze 1996, 157ff), discusses the role of wn.n clause as the most common initial narrative form in Late Egyptian tales. As it stands at the head of a series of non -initial continuative clauses -which are the most basic form for presenting a sequence of events in LE -and is often rubricized, it seems to be marking the formal division of the text into sections. Note, there are no strict rules governing the decision to start a ne w section, and it is best to see as an indication of the pause in the narrative when a wn.n clause appears (eg. the passage from Horus and Seth discussed below). 92 Cf. Westendorf 1981, 57ff. 93 Wb. V, 55.4 -56.9; TLA lemma -no. beating usually produces pain, and qnqn.t , \"to be in the state of having been beaten,\" therefore, can easily be associated with the state of being in pain. The next three continuative c lauses have the subject shifted to the husband.94 At first, this shift in the subject seems to draw attention away from the wife, but it just makes the scene all the more dramatic when she appears as the object of gm and the antecedent of the two statives, sr.t and mr.t, in the third clause. The lat ter of the two, mr.t, is modified by the same adverb, n-, that modifies qnqn.t a few clauses back, signaling a loose parallel between the two expressions. Since the wife has not actually been assaulted and is not suffering from real pain, she has to rely on external manifestations of pain to present herself as such. In the next continuative clause, which is made longer than all the previous continuatives by the circumstantial clauses, the subject switches back to the wife, and here we see the wife p utting on what is called \"pain behavior\" in modern parlance.95 She withdraws from her daily activities, lies down and r b, \"drools,\"96 which all co mmunicate non -verbally that she i s in pain, or ill. This leads the husband to ask the wife what happened, w hich in turn gives the wife the floor to speak. She relates to him the incident in reverse, and as a grand closure to her deceptive story, she gives him an ultimatum, 94 More precisely, the subject shifts back to Anubis, as the st compound ( st clause + wn.n + continuative) with the wife as the subject and as the focalizer is more of a deviation from the flow of main narration, which has Bata and Anubis as the subject and the focalizer. This deviation, though necessary for providing the relevant information required to make sense of the plot progression, takes a toll on the audience's attention and therefore has to be compensated by repeating the narration of the same event twice with some adjustments. That the big brother returned home in the evening is already narrated in 4, 3 -4 (=LES 13, 5), but is repeated in 4, 7 -8 (=LES 13, 12 -13) where the big brother is not referred to as her husband. 95 Pain behavior refers to the various actions or postural displays that serve to communicate the fact that pain is being experienced. Pain behaviors can be verbal (e.g., verbal descriptions of the intensity, location, and quality of pain; voc alizations of distress; moaning, or complaining) or nonverbal (e.g., withdrawing from activities, taking pain medication, or pain related body postures or facial expressions). Keefe and Pryor 2007. 96 While withdrawing from activities and lying down are among the more universal pain behaviors, drooling appears more specific to Egyptian culture. This explains the disagreement among scholars over a correct translation of the term b. Several translations (e.g., Lichteim, Wente) have \"vomiting,\" while Rowinska and Winnicki (1993, 85 -89) argue that the verb is to be translated as \"spitting,\" conveying the wife's contempt of Bata. Here, I have translated as \"drooling\" in light of Ritner 1993, 83. Ritner poin ts out that dripping spittle was felt to characterize illness as well as old age. This nuance survives into a fourth century love spell preserved in Old Coptic, in which the accumulation of saliva is an omen of the victim's mental and physical distress: \"I f a large amount of saliva forms in your mouth as you speak, understand that she is distressed.\" PGM IV, 11.131 -33 in Betz 1986, 40. 173 unless he does something, she will die, which is paralleled in the Doomed Prince .97 Toget her with the ensuing p-wn tw r nt py sm bn, \"because I am suffering (on account of) the evil proposition/plan,\" the wife's speech constitutes the most explicit first -person account of pain in the entire corpus of the Late Egyptian stories. This scene as a whole, while not involving \"real\" pain, tells much about the character of the wife, who uses the pretense of pain to her advantage. The event also moves the plot forward. Immediately following the wife's speech is a new section beginning wi th a wn.in clause that tells of Anubis, who becomes super angry and chases Bata with a spear. Bata is forced to flee, and we are brought to another very dramatic scene (albeit in a different sense) where the next reference to pain occurs. Full of strife an d grief, the scene is the most emotionally charged scene in the entire story: Two Brothers 7, 7-8, 1 (= LES 16, 15-17, 6) wn.nf r rf n p-r-r-.ty wf r f r p mw w p nr r mf wf r gnn p nty pyf sn r m m-r n msw Then he swore by Re -Herakhty, saying, \"As for your coming to kill me unjustly, you carrying your spear, on account of a prostitute's vulva,\"98 and he took a knife of reed, and he cut off his phallus, and he threw it into the water, and the catfish swallowed it, and he became weak, and he became \"he is wretched.\" And his elder brother became greatly 97 It also occurs in the love songs (Chapter 5). In a later Demotic tale ( pCarlsberg 422), a similar episode is found, this time a son to his father, when the father opposes the son's marriage to a certain girl: \"These things which I am saying, if they do not happen, death is the one who is with me as a friend and life is the one who is with me as an enemy. \" Ryholt 2002, 364. 98 More on the term, see Westendorf 1994, 349 ff. For a lexicographical analysis, Servajean 2012, 103 -113. 174 pained/sick of heart, and he began99 to weep fo r him loudly, he not being able to cross over to the place where his younger brother was because of the crocodiles. The section is made of a wn.nf r sm clause which relates Bata's dramatic oath, followed by eight continuative clauses. The first six r elate Bata's actions and physical state of Bata,100 and the last two, Anubis's emotional response. If we were to examine pain from a clinical perspective, the first six clauses would take priority: Bata has just created a situation that calls for immediate medical attention. From a literary perspective, however, it is the last two that are more significant. The first clause of this two has r nt tyf as the predicate. The wording here is unusual. As shown in Chapter 2, expressions involving the pain word (mr, n) and the heart word ( b, ty) occur frequently in the literary corpus. But in most of these cases, they are followed by the dative object, indicating where the pain is directed, which is not the self, but others. Here, there is no dative object . It is just Anubis and his heart.101 What is this pain about, then? The text does not explicitly say, but if we may take the liberty of reading between the lines, this seems to be the kind of pain associated with remorse. Scholars have pointed out that Bat a's emasculation expresses the physical affirmation of his innocence.102 If what is expressed in the six continuative clauses does really prove Bata's innocence, it also proves that Anubis is guilty as charged: it was really on the account of the \"prostitut e's vulva\" that Anubis came to kill Bata unjustly. The violence and irreparability of Bata's self -emasculation make the wrongness of Anubis' action particularly evident, and as a result, Anubis' heart feels that pang of guilt. The final continuative clau se doesn't have the pain word in it, but has as its main 99 Instead of \"he stood, and he wept.\" See Junge 2005, 84. 100 Scholars have interpreted Bata's self -emasculation in terms of Bata trying to add weight to his testimony and to prove his innocence, and in relation to the legend of Osiris. Hollis 1990, 103 -114 for further discussion and bibliography. 101 ni here has the same argument structure as mn. See Chapter 2. 102 See Hollis 1990, 104 for the summary of the interpretation by different scholars and bibliography. 175 predicate rm, \"to weep,\" which is closely associated with pain.103 It is followed by the dative object. The 3ms suffix could be referring to Bata, but it could also be referring to Anubis (ethical dative). In sharp contrast to the previous continuatives, the current clause is made far longer by the circumstantial. Identifying the exact nature of the relationship between the main clause and the circumstantial is not easy, especially when it involves a subtle emotional nuance. I suggest that Anubis's not being able to get to where Bata is because of the crocodiles concretizes the irreversible rupture in the relationship between the brothers, something this section as a whole poignantly portrays.104 On B ata's part, he is already aware of the reality.105 For Anubis, this is just dawning on him. Before going berserk, he was plowing the field with the little brother and \" their hearts were very pleased because of their work at their beginning of work.\" He is n ow back to his ordinary senses, but there is a gulf (literally) between him and the brother. The days of solidarity are past him, and the life will never be the same. The weeping in this context, therefore, doesn't seem to be indicating sympathy for Bata, but mostly the grief over the loss of shared life, which is made all the more painful by the fact that it is Anubis himself who brought it about.106 The pain expression involving heart occurs two more times in the tale. Both instances follow the more conve ntional usage, being followed by the dative object. In both instances, the dative object refers to Bata.107 The first of these occurs at the Valley of Cedar with the gods as its subject: 103 See above in the discussion of the Peasant . 104 Compare this scene to the reunion scene in 14, 3 -4 (=LES 23, 2 -3), where the language of \"oneness\" comes t o the fore. 105 7, 1-2 (=LES 16, 5-6): nn w r pr m-djk r nn w r pr m st wk ms{n} \"I will never with you forever, I will not be in a place where you.\" Similar expression also in 8, 3 (= LES 17, 10 -11). 106 Compare Anubis weeping here to that in 3, 3 (= LES 22, 16 -23, 1), when Anubis finds Bata lying dead. 107 In addition to these two instances, a negative emotion expression involving the heart occurs in 11, 1 -2 (=LES 20, 15), which uses the word w, \"to rot, putrefy\" with a pus determinative: w tyf r w r-qr sp -sn... \"and his (the washer of the pharaoh) heart became rotten very much...\" See Toro Rueda 2003, 298 -299. 176 Two Brothers 9, 3 -6 (= LES 19, 2-8) prt pw r.nf m pyf bn wf r n srw n p{y st}t r-rwf wn.n t pst r d n w msn r d nf bt k n t pst n-wk dy w.tw f p-r-r-ty st-mt n bt tm{k}<f> mst w He went out from his villa and encountered the Ennead as they were going about governing the entire land. Then the Ennead spoke in unison, saying to him, \"Oh, Bata, Bull of the Ennead, are you not here alone, you having deserted your town before the face of the wife of Inpw, your big brother. Look, he has killed his wife, therefore you have returned to him the account of any wrong against you,\" their hearts being pained for him very much. And Pre -Harakhti said to Khnum, \"Build a woman for Bata that he may n ot live alone.\" The reference to pain here is interesting because the notion of the god(s) feeling pain for humans, which is only implied or poetically evoked in Sinuhe , is here explicitly incorporated into the plot.108 Similar to Sinuhe , the gods feeling pain for the protagonist (and helping the protagonist out of that pain) does not happen out of the blue, but the expectation that it will has been gradually building. At the beginning of the story, when Bata was still living with his brother and his wife, it was made clear that Bata is a hard -working family man. He would go out to the field, herd cattle and bring home every good thing for his brother and his wife.109 When he arrives at the Valley of Cedar, Bata continues to do the same. Although he h as switched from cattle herding to hunting wild animals,110 he stills bring home every good thing ( t nbt nfrt ). Here, he does not have any family, but he hopes he could start one ( n-bw grg n f pr).111 The obvious 108 The idea that the god(s) would grant someone's desire out of sympathy (instead of according to justice or on a whim, for instance) seems to be closely connected with the idea of personal piety, which refers to the intimate religious attitude towards the go d who listens to prayers. As mentioned, the idea is already present in Sinuhe , but in the Two Brothers , (the text dated to the so -called age of personal piety), it is just made more obvious/ objective(?), largely owing to the third -person narration. In add ition to the passage cited here, there's another instance that shows the personal god hearing prayer in 6, 4-6 (= LES 15, 11 -13). 109 1, 2 (= LES 9, 13 -14); 1, 4-7 (=LES 10, 4 -7). 110 8, 9 (= LES 18, 11 -12); 10, 1 (= LES 19, 12 -13). 111 9, 2 (= LES 18, 16). 177 obstacle to Bata's family plan is that he d oesn't have anyone ( w nn w nf) with whom he could start a family.112 That Bata is presented as being far from home and utterly alone creates a situation comparable to the one encountered in Sinuhe , where the audience is made to sympathize with the protagonist. Hence, by the time the Ennead enters the scene and starts speaki ng in unison, \"Oh, Bata...aren't you here alone, having deserted your city...\" it is as if the audience, too, is part of that unison ( w msn). The gods' hearts ache for Bata, so does the audience's. What the audience can't do for Bata, however, is to help Bat a start a family, but the gods can. Pre -Harakhty's having Khnum fashion a woman for Bata is a propos , both in terms of plot development and of audience engagement. Too bad for Bata, acquiring a wife does not bring him happiness, only more trouble. Being disloyal and conniving, the wife treats Bata badly, which again puts Bata in a situation where someone ends up feeling pain for him. After having died once because of the wife, Bata comes back to life in the form of a bull, but the wife wants to have him killed again.113 She places her new husband, the pharaoh, under an oath and corners him to the position where he is forced to kill Bata the bull.114 The pharaoh, who has developed a great liking of the bull, feels much pain over the situation: Two Brothers 1 6, 5-6 (= LES 26, 6) w tw r nt n p ns r qr sp -sn w ty n pr- .w.s mr n f r qr sp -sn And one (pharaoh) suffered very much at/because of what she said, the heart of pharaoh, lph, being pained for him (Bata) very much. Like the passage dealing with Anubis' pain above, the pharaoh's pain is spread out in two main 112 8, 9 (= LES 18, 11). One -person household was not a thing in ancient Egypt. 113 Like in the case with Anubis' wife, it is fear that Bata's ex -wife to do what she does. 16, 1 -2 (=LES 25, 14 -15). 114 16, 3 -4 (=LES 26, 2 -3). 178 clauses. The repetition r qr sp -sn grabs attention. The pain conveyed in the first clause is not directly about Bata, but about the wife's speech, indicated by the dative object n p ns, \"at/because of what she said.\" The tale does not reveal much detail about the content of the wife's speech to the pharaoh, save for how she wants to eat the bull's liver.115 The second clause is about Bata. The wording is same as that of the one involving the Ennead. But unlike the Ennead who, out of their sympathy for Bata, step in and actively \"help\" by fashioning the wife for Bata, the pharaoh here remains passive; instead of intervening to rescue Bata, the pharaoh proceeds to kill Bata the next day. As such, the pharaoh's pain for Bata does not seem to contribute much to the plot the way the Ennead's pain for Bata. I suggest that the statement's main role is to convey the d egree of affection the pharaoh has for Bata. Earlier, it is said that the pharaoh loved Bata r qr sp -sn r rm nb nty m p t r-rf, \"very much, over any human being in the entire land.\"116 If you have no choice but to kill somebody that you love r qr sp-sn, of course, it hurts r qr sp -sn. 4.3.1.2 The Contendings of Horus and Seth The longest of the New Kingdom stories, The Contendings of Horus and Seth takes a variety of pre -existing mythic episodes surrounding the rivalry between Horus and Seth and interweaves them into one that ultimately ends with Horus' victory. At a surface level, it appears as if there is little narrative logic connecting one epis ode to another. This has led some modern scholars to complain about the long -windedness of the story.117 That being said, the tale presents 115 16, 4 -5 (=LES 26, 3 -5). 116 15, 6 (= LES 25, 6 -7). 117 Posener (1971, 240) describes it as \"an interminable trial before the ennead convened under the presidency of Re.\" Oden (1979, 354) notes, \"the tale does tarry, and it does try a reader's patience.\" Wente (2003, 91) says, \"perhaps the one with the least literary merit, for there is very little in the way of suspen se to maintain the reader's interest throughout the narrative.\" Broze's in -depth structural analysis of the tale (1996), however, shows that this is not simply the case. According to her, the cohesion of the text is primarily achieved on the level of form, in terms of 179 a rare opportunity to get a glimpse into the lively world of the gods as imagined by the ancient Egyptians. The value s very dear to the Egyptians such as justice and family solidarity118 get transposed onto the gods, and the otherwise austere Egyptian gods are depicted as subject to human fragility.119 Two references to pain are made. The first occurs in reference to Pre -Harakhti at the end of the first round of proceedings at the court. All the gods have expressed their view in favor of granting the office of Osiris to Horus, except for Pre -Harakhti, who is insistent on giving it to Seth. This results in impasse where all the gods are frustrated. Finally: Horus and Seth 3, 10-4, 1 (=LES 40, w bb p nr r dwn f wf r d n p-r-r-ty krk w .n p-r-r-ty r nt t wbt d nf wf psf (A) sgb r-bnr p bt .rk y r- qr wsn r mt r nysn mww p r w.tf -----(C) ...and Baba121 the got up, and he said to Pre -Harakhty, \"your shrine is empty.\" Thereupon Pre -Harakhti suffered (on account of) the statement that was said to him, and he lay down on his back, his heart (f eeling) very bad. Thereupon the Ennead went outside, and they let out a loud cry before the face for Baba the god. and they said to him, \"get out, this offence which you made is very great!\" And they departed to their tents. both graphics and narrative (as opposed to the causal relevance of the events that modern readers are more used to). See especially her comments on the significance of the repetition of structure in at ibid., 175 -176. 118 Cf. Sweeney 2002, 143 . 119 Cf. Baines 1999, 37: \"This is a narrative about the world of gods that takes material, episodes, situations, transitivities from the divine context and reincorporates it into a story -telling framework that has a distinctly anthropomorphized cast...As th e audience reads or listens, it does not believe in the things the narrative tells, even though they embody what is deeply true. In certain directions they go beyond what we would otherwise see in a literary story.\" 120 The form of ww here should be stative , and the presence of r here, according to Gardiner ( LES 41a, 3, 11a) is something that is \"thoughtlessly borrowed from the adverb r-ww, which is used twice (6, 5 and 8, 5) in the text. 121 More on Baba, see now Leitz 1994, 103 -117. 180 Thereupon the great god spent t he day, lying on his back in his pavilion, his heart (feeling) very bad, and he was alone by himself. There have been some debates on what Baba's insult must have really meant,122 although there are no conclusive interpretations regarding it. For the present purpose, though, we can conclude that it is bad enough to make Pre-Harakhti suffer and bad enough to make the Enneads yell at Baba and kick him out. Here, the word ni, as in A nubis's wife's speech, has the speech/proposition, rather than the heart, as the object. Although the gods have been all very mad at Pre -Harakhty, they avoid an open confrontation with him. Instead, they use the Baba incident as an excuse to go back to the ir respective tents ( r nysn mww). This leaves Pre -Harakhty all alone. The continuative clause following the last .n clause in the passage (B) repeats almost verbatim the content of the continuative clause following the first .n clause (A), the o nly difference being the newly added m pyf s \"in his pavilion.\" This newly added phrase conveys the solitude of Pre -Harakhty as it forms a contrast with the phrase r nysn mww \"to their tents.\" And if this contrast is too subtle to drive the message home, the last continuative clause (C) explicitly says that Pre -Harakhty is alone. The added emphasis on aloneness conforms to the pattern we have seen a few times, that pain and solitude go hand in hand. Accordingly, the cure comes from finding oneself i n the company of others. The episode that directly follows tells of Hathor coming to visit Pre -Harakhty.123 Once Hathor's dance cheers up Pre -Harakhty, Pre - 122 According to the in terpretation put forth by Walls (2001, 99), the passage alludes to the Book of Dead, Utterance 93, where Baba is blamed for Re's sexual impotence. Broze (1996, 238 -243) argues that kr w refers to the absence of the daughter Maat from the chapel or cabin of the solar barque. A parallel in Papyrus Anastasi IV 11,11 (= LEM 47, 9 -10) suggests that the phrase refers to, in general, the state where an essential element is missing. He points ou t the idea of kr w contrasts with the idea of kr w. According to what is often expressed in the solar hymns, the w- ness of the kr is predicated on the presence of Re's daughters on the boat, and especially, the daughter Maat is required for the per fect navigation of the barque. Both interpretations place the passage within the dense network of mythological/religious meanings, therefore, invaluable. But neither fully explains how the insult works within the story. For instance, is Baba's insult in re ference to the way Pre -Harakthy has been handling the situation at the court proceeding in the story? (Given the judicial context within which this scene is set, this sounds quite plausible). Is Baba practically saying that Pre -Harakhty has lost his sense for justice, and therefore his judgement has no relevance to the court proceeding? See Lichtheim 1976, 223 n.7. 123 This is an allusion to the festival of the returning goddess. 181 Harakhty gets up and sits once again with the Ennead. Only then does he return to his normal duty of adjudicating.124 The second occasion occurs in the episode where Isis harpoons the two rivals who had transformed themselves into hippopotamuses.125 In the beginning of the episode, Isis is seen r rmyt , \"weeping,\" because she thinks she is about to lose her son to Seth. Out of maternal instinct to look out for her son, Isis then makes a harpoon and hurls it into the water, intending to hit Seth. Instead, she hits Horus. The story continues: Horus and Seth 9, 1-3 (= LES 48, 16-49, 3) .n r r sgb r-d my n mwt st ty mwt n mty sf m nk r s st .n st r sgb ws r d n mty sf{f} py r py .n pys mty r sf mf Thereupon Horus let out a loud cry saying, \"Help me, mother Isis, my mother, call out to your barb to let go of me! I am Horus, son of Isis!\" Thereupon Isis let out a loud cry and told the barb, \"Let go of him! See, that's my son Horus, my child.\" Thereupo n her barb let go of him. The phrase sgb appears often throughout the text.126 Though it is frequently accompanied by the explicit expressions of sensation or emotion,127 or gestures and behaviors closely related to them,128 the phrase itself does not seem to be expressive of emotion, let alone expressive of one particular emotion. In this passage, the phrase is mainly used to introduce the speeches of the characters. What the phrase conveys is that the gods are not simply saying the words, but they 124 4, 1-3 (=LES 41,7-11). 125 The same episode appears in two Ramesside papyri that are known as the calendars of luck and unlucky days (Sallier IV and Cairo calendar). Leitz 1994, 54 -7; Broze 1996, 76 -78. 126 See the table in Sweeney 2002, 149. 127 E.g., joy in 1, 5 -6 (=LES 37, 8 -9) and anger in 13, 1 -2 (=LES 54, 9 -10). 128 For instance, when Horus shows Isis his hands that have caught Seth's semen, she lets out a loud cry, \"took up her knife, cut off his hand, threw them into the water...\" 11, 6 -7 (=LES 52, 5 -7). Or, when Seth announces to the Ennead that he has done man's work again Horus, the Ennead \"let out a loud cry and spat on Horus.\" 12, 3 -4 (=LES 53, 7 -8). 182 are yelling the words. Why all this yelling? It is only when trying to answer a questio n like this that the need to refer to emotion becomes more obvious and natural. As for Horus, it can be understood as a shout of pain and distress, as well as an urgent call for help. As for Isis, it is maternal mirroring: the mother yells out of distress because the child yells out of distress. In the latter half of the episode, Isis gives a second try at harpooning Seth and this time she hits the right target. The phrase sgb occurs once more, this time with Seth as its subject. The way Isis respo nds to this is very interesting: Horus and Seth 9, 4-9, 7 (= LES 49, 5 -49, 11) wn.ns r wm r wtf n r p mw wf r dp m m n st .n st r sgb m-d r r snt st n mty sf m nk py sn n mwt nt tys qr sp -sn .n st r ns r-d n-w mry p s rr r sn n mwt st .n st r n pys mty m -d sf mf mk sn n mwt n st p .dpk mf wn.n p mty r sf mf Then she threw it again to the water, and it bit into the body of Seth. Thereupon Seth let out a loud cry, saying, \"What have I done against you, sister Isis? Call out to your barb to let go of me! I am your maternal brother, Isis.\" Then she felt very pained/sick of her heart for him. Thereupon Seth called out to Isis, s aying, \"Do you love the stranger more than the maternal brother Seth?\"129 Thereupon Isis called out to her barb, saying, \"let go of him. Look, it's Isis's maternal brother who you have bitten into.\" Then the barb let of go of him. Seth's letting out loud cry conveys pain and distress, similar to that of Horus, but it also has an added nuance that is not present in Horus' cry. Instead of a direct request for help (like Horus' my n ), there's some maneuvering or persuasion involved here, as indicated by the rhetorical question.130 He also makes use of kinship terms, addressing Isis as snt, \"sister\" and referring to 129 On the meaning of the term rr and the significance of attributing it to Horus in the p assage, see Broze 1996, 78. 130 This seems to be one of rare instances where a wh -question is used as rhetorical question. Sweeney 1990, 327. 183 himself as sn n mwt , \"maternal brother.\" This makes Isis halt. Her heart feels much pain for Seth. Notice that the event of Isis' pain at this juncture is given in a wn.n clause. According to Broze, a wn.n clause creates a split between the action it introduces and the situation that precedes it, while an .n clause integrates the action into the context to which it is an immediate consequence or reaction.131 Hence, having an .n clause would seem to make more sense, since Isis' feeling pain is a direct reaction to Seth's words. That an wn.n clause is used instead, then, signals a shift in the f low of the sequence of events. To be sure, it doesn't seem to create a complete split in the narrative, but it still signals a subtle shift in the tone. When Seth speaks again, notice that he does not sgb , but just -es. Mirroring this, Isis, too, s imply -es to the barb. It is as though, with the event of Isis' feeling pain for Seth, the frenzy that began the scene has calmed down a little. This, then, leads to an unexpected outcome: Seth is let go.132 The event of Seth's release is also given a wn.n clause. This contrasts with the event of Horus's release (9,3), which uses the same wording but is given in an .n clause . The subtle nuance created here in light of Broze's theory is that unlike Isis' release of Horus, which can be seen as a predictable and natural reaction, the release of Seth is not. 4.3.2 Post -Ramesside Literary Narratives 4.3.2.1 The Misfortunes of We namun Surviving in an incomplete copy, The Misfortunes of Wenamun features the journey of the principal character Wenamun, who is sent to Byblos to acquire lumber for a new cultic barque. The text is framed as an official document, wherein the events of Wenamun's journey 131 Broze 1996, 211. 132 It has been pointed out that Isis's response here is inconsistent with her character througho ut the tale. As Sweeney notes (2002, 154), Isis is quintessentially a goddess who operates out of family loyalties, it seems to make much sense, since it is only this episode where the kinship between Seth and Isis is directly brought out. 184 are narrated in the first -person: Wenamun \"reports\" what he sees, hears, and experiences (almost) as they happen.133 The strings of continuative clauses that are used throughout the text may appear to possess no literary merits, but they are actually very appropriate for imparting a great degree of immediacy and realism.134 Much of the text is taken up by the direct speeches, and in particular, the lengthy verbal sparring between Wenamun and Tjkerbaal takes center stage.135 The title Gardi ner gave to the text gives away that Wenamun's journey is rife with difficulties. He is robbed, mistreated, stranded, and beaten. But it is difficult to empathize with Wenamun than with the peasant, Sinuhe or Bata. In large part, it is because Wenamun is a less likable figure. We see him stealing and being rude, and as a rule of thumb, readers are less inclined to attend to the signs of pain of those whom they find morally reprehensible. Also, and not unrelated to the previous point, the difficulty has to d o with the obscure authorial intention. Many scholars have identified the presence of an ironical authorial voice and see the text as a satire or parody.136 In a satire, the characters undergoing pain are not supposed to invite pain, but humor. Most signifi cantly, it has to do with the unique style of the first -person narration employed in the text. The style of narration employed in Wenamun verges on being omniscient, which provides many external details.137 When it comes to the feelings/interior states of Wenamun, however, the amount and scope of information provide is very restricted. Wenamun, both as the character and the narrator, looks out to the external world, but hardly looks into 133 Baines 1999, 2 15. 134 Jay 2011. The extent of realism led early scholars to regard the text as a real report. For the history of the scholarly reception of the text, see Winand 2011, 541 -543. 135 Baines (1999, 221) compares Wenamun's verbal sparring with Tjkerbaal to Sinuhe's fight to the hero. Cf. Suhr 2016, 120 136 Blumenthal 1972, 11; Baines 1999, 211 -212; Eyre 1999, 252. 137 For instance, down to exact amount of silver and gold lost, or the amoun t of beer and meat provided by the chief, the amount of the shipped goods, etc., the emotions of the other character, and even the details of scenes which the first-person narrator could not have witnessed. 185 himself.138 He appear s to be lacking in self -reflection and/or emotionally muted. This is in sharp contrast to Sinuhe , where the first -person is optimized to make accessible Sinuhe's interior thoughts and sentiments to the audience, which, together with the carefully chosen ge neric forms for creating the appropriate mood, plays no small part in informing the audience of what is going on and prepares the audience to make sense of and share in Sinuhe's pain. In Wenamun , with out any explicit comments by the \"inner -self,\" the audie nce is left on their own and must glean from the subtle nuance of the speeches, or the reaction of other characters.139 As a result, even when we encounter Wenamun crying, it is difficult to figure out what to make of it. The passage featuring Wenamun's we eping is placed at the end of the Byblos phase, when Wenamun has finished the negotiation with the chief and is back at the shore:140 Wenamun 2, 62 -68 (= LES 73, 13-74, 3) w m n <r> sp{r}<t> p ym r p nty n tw m w w nw r 11 n br ww {n}<m> w {n}<m> p ym jw ns -st d sw m -dy brw m -df r p t n kmt w pr ms.tw rm w p s n p wr y n r-bnr wf d n rk ptr n g -r r n r kmt -----A ptr stww ny r qb -----B r d.tf n p wr w p rm -{r}<d > n mdt [ Baines 1999, 217 : Wenamun is among the narrative texts which least evidently mobilize their audience, and its balance of moral advantage and adversity is less obvious. Instead, part of what the first -person form does is to present a character in an apparently detached way...Wenamun handles character without Sinuhe's metalevels of passages that stand back to comment upon the narrative and upon the protagonist's sense of what it means and where it is going. 140 Schipper 2005, 255 for a grammatical, formal analysis of the passage. 141 The transliteration given in Ramses Online (a digital annotated corpus of Late Egyptian; this particular line has been annotated by Ga\u00eblle Chantrain and Anne -Claude Honnay ) has smr here. For reading of mr as mr, see 186 I took myself off <to> the shore of the sea to the place [where the logs were], being set down, and I looked at eleven freighters, they coming from the sea and belonging to the Tjeker, saying \"Apprehend him! do not allow freighters (heading) for the land of Egypt to be at his disposal!\" and I began to sit and cry, and the letter scrib e of the Chief came to me outside, and he asked me \"What is with you?\" and I replied to him \"Can you not see the migratory birds142 who have already gone down to Egypt twice? Look at them travelling to the cool143! (But) until when (lit. until what comes) am I to be abandoned here, for can't you see those [who have come] in order to apprehend me again?\" And he went and he reported it t o the Chief. The chief began to cry because the words [that were said to him] were painful . In terms of plot too, we cannot be so certain how this episode fits within the story as a whole, because of the missing ending. The quest structure makes full sens e from the viewpoint of the completed quest. But even assuming that Wenamun eventually finds his way back to Egypt, and that the Byblos phase is meant to represent the climax of the story, having an episode whose \"content appears almost entirely emotional\"144 at this juncture in the story is puzzling. Not only does it stall the story, but the emotional dynamics also here seem inconsistent with the rest of the story. For instance, the sudden emotional outburst and open display of vulnerability is at odds with the character of Wenmaun, who has remained, more or less, emotionally muted. That Tjkerbaal would cry after Wenamun is no less difficult to make sense of, in light of the nature of the relationship between the two portrayed thus far (not really on friendl y terms) and the action of Tjkerbaal on the following day. Baines therefore sees this passage among those passages that do not take the narrative forward but contribute to enhancing the structure of the whole.145 Baine's observation has merits, and I would like to elaborate on it by focusing on the last sentence of the passage, in which the word mr occurs. Chapter 2, n.52. The word in question is placed at the very beginning of line 68, where the edge is slightly destroyed. There maybe enough space for s to fit in, but it is not certain. 142 See Goelet 1983, 50 -2 for gsw, \"migratory birds.\" 143 The qb \"cool\" region is to the north of Egypt, Egberts 1991, 62 -67, followed by Wente 2003, 123 and von Lieven 2007, 156. Goedicke 1975, 120, however, argues that it refers to the Nile delta. 144 Baines 1999, 219. 145 Baines 1999, 219. 187 Scholars have interpreted the last sentence as an instance of sympathy, reciprocal weeping, and solidarity.146 While such interpretation cannot be ruled o ut, the wording/phrasing suggests a slightly different meaning for this last sentence. What the text says is m-d n mdt .dw nf ww mr , \"because the words that were said to him were painful, \" and there is no reference to a heart aching or a dative object referring to Wenamun. Instead, it is the words that are painful.147 The painful words most certainly refer to Wenamun' s answer to the scribe's question, which comprises several lines of the te xt. The speech begins with the negative aorist bw rf sm construction (A),148 followed by an imperative ptr st (B) and the terminative question + interrogative particle .tw (C).149 The last clause makes use of the bw r f sm construction agai n but this time preceded by the particle r (D). The repetition of n bw rk ptr in (A) and (D) forms an inclusio to the speech. The object of ptr in (A) is the birds, and the object of ptr in (D) is pirates. This vividly captures what Wenamun is seeing at the moment. Recall that Wenamun is on the shore of the Mediterranean ocean , looking toward s the sea. When you gaze toward the ocean from the shore, it seems as though the ocean meets the sky. There, y ou do not have to shift your gaze in order to see what is in the sky and what is in the ocean. The flock of ships and the flock of migratory birds are all within one scene. In that Wenamun's words here provide a snapshot of what Wenamun is seei ng at the moment, 146 Baines (1999, 220 n.41), for instance, compares this instance with the instance of crowd's heart aching for Sinuhe, referring to both scenes as \"quasi -proverbial anecdotes.\" 147 The painful words, of course, presuppose a sentient subject who is pained by th e words, and here, the sentient subject would be Tjkerbaal. But the wording foregrounds the quality of the words, not the emotional state of Tjkerbaal (or Wenamun). 148 Junge 2005, 100. 149 Winand (2011, 553) points out the parallel in The Doomed Prince (Harr is 500 vso. 4, 12 -13 = LES 2,12): y jw m-nms.kw \"(it) occurs why, that I stay here?\" According to hims, these two cases represesent rare instances of a fronted terminative in the Late Egyptian corpus. 188 their effect maybe comparable to the famous passage concerning the window of Tjkerbaal's upper room.150 I suggest Tjkerbaal's response to Wenamun's words with weeping is comparable to the case of the peasant's mdt nfrt being more beautiful ( nfr) than anything in the pharaoh's heart. Tjkerbaal cries (pain behavior) because the object (the words) is painful.151 The main difference between the two occasions (in addition to the difference in lexical choice) is that in the Peasant , although the words rose out of a painful situation, the words themselves are nfr, having been inspired by the longing for maat. It was precisely the pharaoh's concern for maat that made him particularly moved by the peasant's words. In the present case, however, neither Wenamun nor Tjkerbaal seem s to have much concern for maat . Tjkerbaal 's response is more \"sensual,\" one may say, as illus trated by his gesture of sending food, wine, the Egyptian singer to Wenamun,152 with the following message: Wenamun 2, 70 tyk srw nb nty w (r) df n dww Eat, drink, do not let affairs seize your heart. You will hear everything I will say tomorrow.153 Baines notes that Tjkerbaal's actions toward Wenamun the next day do no t show any sympathy for Wenamun, \"the weeping is as it were bypassed.\"154 In my view, this is precisely because there was not much sympathy to begin with. 150 1, 48 -50 (= LES 66, 3 -6) 151 Throughout the story, Tjekerbaal says and does a lot of things traditional ly associated with the Egyptian pharaohs, but not quite the same way. 152 2, 68 -69 (= LES 74, 4 -6) 153 The mood evoked here is reminiscent of that of the Harper's songs, which have been described as \"melancholy carpe diem.\" Lichtheim 1945. 154 Baines 1990, 220. 189 4.3.2.2 The Tale of Woe The last text to be examined is Papyrus Moscow 127, more commonly known as the Tale of Woe or the Letter of Wermai .155 Written in literary Late Egy ptian, it was found in the same jar with Wenamun , but has received significantly less scholarly attention, owing to the unusual orthography, vocabulary, and grammar.156 The text also represents a generic anomaly in that it is a literary text in an epistolar y form,157 with a significant narrative section. In the letter , Wermai tells his friend Usermarenakht how his life has been full of woes and pain and asks him to relay the letter to an unnamed benefactor, whom Wermai hopes might come to his aid.158 In a narrow sense, only the parts in which Wermai recounts his past experiences constitute the narrative proper.159 The ways in which this narrative section is conjoined to the requests and wishes, as well as to the very event of Wermai's letter, add furth er depth to representation of Wermai's pain. Throughout the letter, Wermai embeds himself in the narrative where he figures as a 155 Caminos' 1977 edition includes the photos of the hieratic manuscript, hieroglyphic transcription, translation with extensive philological notes. For translations: Allam1975, 147 -153; Quack 2001, 167 -181. 156 Osing 1983, 175. As Quack (2 001, 168) points out, Caminos' edition provides detailed analysis of orthography and lexical meaning, but not much analysis of verbal system. 157 The use of epistolary form in a literary context is very rare, and the onlyother known example is P. Anastasi I (Ramesside Satirical Letter). 158 After the address and greetings that closely follow the New Kingdom epistolary style (1, 1 -9), the two extended, rather sinister \"far be it from you\" wishes follow (2, 4), which are not all that typical but appear to be sp ecifically tailored to the content of the letter. The language of the wishes is heavy on the theme of death, and Seibert (1967) has described this section as Todesbefallenheit , \"death infestation.\" Moers 2001, 275. The language of this introductory part is closer to Middle Egyptian compared to what follows which is closer to Later Egyptian. Quack 2001, 168. For register variation within the letters, see Winand 1992, 23 -25; Sweeney 2001; Gohy 2012. The phrase n d nty signals the start of the \"meat\" part of the letter wherein Wermai recounts his past hardship leading up to the present time (2, 4 -3, 13; narrative I). This section can be further divided into three different stages, depending on the whereabouts of Wermai in his journey. The first part (2, 4 -11) relates the persecutions he experienced in his hometown leading to the exile. The second part (2, 12 -3, 4) narrates his wanderings, highly remeniscient of Sinuhe's flight scene and the third part (3, 4 -13), gives th e account since the arrival at the Great Oasis. Wermai then presents his request to Usermarenakht, that his letter be passed on to an unnamed benefactor, whom, Wermai hopes, will rescue him from his hardship (3, 13 -4, 8). Next follows another narrative sec tion (narrative II), this time, that of the more recent past, involving difficulties in producing enough grains to pay taxes (4, 8 -5, 2). The letter then comes to a rather abrupt end. With no word of farewell, Wermais expresses more wishes (5, 2 -6). See Ca minos 1977, 79 - 80 for the plot summary. 159 2, 4-3, 13 and 4, 8 -5, 2. 190 passive sufferer of injustice and violence. When he begins recalling past events, the verb forms used are mostly statives and passive smfs,160 which convey the sense of how things just happened to Wermai, and there was not much he could do: Tale of Woe 2, 4 -11 tw mn st w ... tk(n).kw (r-) bnr m st n sf dd n t t m m-w ry... I was removed falsely. I was defrauded without speech. I was robbed. There was no crime on my part. I was thrown out from my city, my property having been seized. It could not be saved...I was chased away from my position of yesterday, made to wander in goin g and coming strenuously. Tale of Woe 3, 4 -6 pr m.t I wandered ar ound villages, I being on foot. (M y) horses were seized, and (my) chariot was taken, my team snatched from my hand, their belts (=reins?) were taken, and another was upon them. I t was not I who I gave them (?), I being forced to walk. In these passages, Wermai simply narrates one event after another from a relative distance. This contrasts with the ensuing section where Wermai reflects on the solitary state that his exile has 160 Quack 2001, 169ff; Jay 2008, 19. 161 Caminos (1977, 37) understands the sense of sp here as \"to suffer, endure,\" and for what comes after sp, he suggests to read it as either nyw <spw> (y) gns or nyw <spw> (y) <n> gns, meaning \"their great acts of violence.\" He thus gives the translation: \"(I) suffered their (=the enemies') great acts of violence.\" Quack (2001, 176 n.86) rightly points out, Caminos reading requires too many adjustments. The alternative Quack suggests is to see gns as a corruption of gs, \"belt.\" 162 Caminos (1977, 37 n.10) understands the word to mean \"cry out, scream,\" most probably because the word is followed by the hand to mouth determinative. Accordin g to Quack (2001, 176 n.86), however, this represents the common spelling of ky in other texts dating from the same period. 191 placed him in. Here, the narration of past events starts increasingly being taken over by introspection and state ments about his feelings:163 Tale of Woe 7-13 qnw w164 (r) rt-nr w (r) p m ty I spent time in a city not my own, or a town I knew not, a companion of strangers165 ...If only there had been a message to comfort the heart when I fell a victim to wrong -doing. There never was an inquiry after my condition in the course of my comings and goings. When flesh and bone are abandoned on the desert -edge, who is going to bury hi m? They did not send (a message) to express concern for me. See, neither the dead nor the living cared for me in my pains . What will they (my pains) signify anyway, when I am in the realm of the dead and in the sight of the Horizon of God? The temporality here is ambiguous. He is recalling the past events (nn sp sn nn, \"there was never an inquiry\" ; hbw,\"they not send (a message) ; bw nhp n, \"(they) did not care for me\"), but are the rhetorical questions that are interspersed between them (e.g., n n-m, \"who... ; ww , \"what...\" ) also of the past , or do they belong to the present? That is, did he make these comments back then and now only reporting that he made these comments in the past, or do they represent how Wermai feels about the past events at the moment of his writing? According to the snake from the Shipwrecked Sailor , recounting one's experience when pain has passed is joyful. For Wermai, it does not seem li ke pain has passed; Wermai continues to feel the pain's sting. 163 Caminos 1977, 77. 164 Written with r for w. Caminos 1977, 42. 165 According to Caminos (1977, 38), this is one of the compound words with ry, literally, \"a companion of unusual things\" or \"one associated with strangers,\" referring to a person that feels himself foreign or at least unfamiliar to the milieu. In the same place, Camino references a Coptic word with the similar connotation, \"the condition of a stranger.\" In Coptic literature, this condition was thought to be \"as painful as the severest tortures which could be inflicted upon a Christian martyr.\" 192 It is during this temporally ambiguous section that the reference to the unnamed benefactor is first made in order to solicit help. Wermai's request to Usermarenakht to pass on the copy of his letter to the benefactor signals the transition to the here and now. As Suhr notes, such reference to a copy of this letter adds a greater sense of immediacy and urgency to the reader when he looks at the text that he is holding in his hand as if it were a copy made on behalf of Wermai.166 Also here another phrase with the word mr occurs : Tale of Woe 3, 15-4, 8 wf dww m w nf n n b m ny dbnbn w nk pw b tsn m w r nn pr w m di ... w nk w b() m d wf (r) yt n wwy He will come forthwith when my utterance is sent to him, (so I said) to my heart in my wanderings. Do send a messenger to him with a copy of my letter from your place.

I ache with hunger (and so are) those who are with me...the Nile is stopped, and their land is darkness. They cannot escape from dire affliction...Send for yourself (my letter), for I am confident (lit. my heart is full) that he will come for the needy. After the period of wandering by himself, Wermai arrives at the oasis to seek refuge. Life at the oasis, however, is not anyway better. What seems to be happening in this passage is that Wermai, in soliciting he lp, now embeds himself in the narrative of communal su ffering. He has not seen 166 Suhr 2016, 130. See also Caminos 1977, 78 n.1 167 Note the rarely attested verb sp \"ache with Wb. I, 132.13; Lesko I, 54; TLA lemma -no.31480. Usually written with the arm with the stick determinative, here written with the bad bird determinative. C aminos 1977, pls. 9&10 193 grain and is suffering from hunger, just like everyone else who is with him . In this context, the phrase mk mr b seems not to be just about Wermai's individual plight. Though it is his individual heart that is in pain, his pain is caused by our\u2014the collective \u2014plight. Correspondingly, the help that Wermai is seeking is not just for himself, but for the whole community of wwy, \"the needy\" (4, 8). Of no small significance is that the phrase mk mr b sounds manifestly archaic. Combined with the references to the dried -up Nile and the darkened land which are time -old literary motifs for portraying Egypt in distress, the current section is particularly reminiscent of literary laments. We shall examine the language of literary laments more closely in the next chapter. Here, suffice it to say that literary laments are a genre heavily concerned with maat . By providing extensive descriptions of woeful conditions that Egypt undergoes when ever maat is absent , literary laments call to attention the ever -present need for enacting maat at both individual and communal level s. Although no explicit reference to maat is made in the current passage, u sing the language that is reminiscient of literary laments using can produce a similar effect. The ending of the letter, which Caminos has described as \"an impassioned outpouring of sentiment in which regret, anxiety and hope combine\"168 is similarly archaic:169 Tale of Woe 5, 1-6 d n b y st n tyw spwy n mm pn.kw m bkiw st ds tm r pr 168 Caminos 1977, 64. 169 Quack 2001, 181. This section, too, is fraught with philological difficulties. The ending of the letter appears to be continuous with the narrative II that relates certain events involving grains and taxes. The events recounted in the narrative II seem to have taken place in more recent past than those told in the narrative I. The events narrated in the narrative II contain more specific details, including the quoted direct speeches, in a manner similar to the L ate Egyptian letters. The immediate purpose the narrative II appears to be in providing the background on how Wermai and the people came to be in the plight mentioned in 4, 3. References are made to the burdensome tax (4, 12) and the false grain measure (4 , 14). These references not only reflect the current state of the unjust society, but similar to the motifs of the dried up Nile and darkened land, are evocatice of the language of the literary laments. Hence, similar to the transition from the narrative I to the request, it is that signals the temporality has shifted to here and now. 194 hn() my bw w ()170 r-gsk bt wnf ... hn my p f ny sbtw I said to my heart, \"Let the sparrows take the remnant of the grains, and let me be rid of the tax and the staff, which caused shame to excess. \"171 O that I should not have to send to you (the message) about the great crime which was before my god...O that he should reach my oppressors. The key feature expressive of the tone of Wermai's emotional state is the repetition of the particle hn() followed by my.172 In the next chapter, we will come back to the literary effect of the repeated use of this particle. 4.4 Conclusion This chapter has examined pain as represented in Egyptian narrative literature of varying kinds. In particular, I focused on the scenes whe re the word mr (also less frequently n) occurs as the locus, and how these scenes fit into the overall plot. The table below summarizes the representations of pain examined in this chapter. Table 4. Representation of Pain in the Literary Narratives Text Pain Representation Peasant - Narrated: peasant cries out of pain, when abused by Nemtinakht - Petitions feature first -person account of pain by the peasant Shipwrecked Sailor - Snake refers to loss of his family as a painful event - By extension, the sailor's loss a painful event Sinuhe - The crowd feels pain for Sinuhe - Sinuhe asks the nameless god to feel pain for him. Two Brothers - The wife pretends to be suffering pain - Anubis' heart is pained (=remorse) - The Ennead feel pain for Bata - The p haraoh feels pain for Bata Horus and Seth - Re is pained by what was said in the council - Isis feels pain for Seth Wenamun - The chief cries having found Wenamun' speech painful Tale of Woe - Wermai narrates his life full of pain and woes 170 Reference to the act of sending the letter mirrors 4, 1. 171 Literally, \"caused (me) to be ashamed until (I) left. \" 172 Caminos 1977, 65. Gardiner 1955, 288ff; Satz inger 1976, 109ff; Junge 2012, 88. 195 Perhaps the most obvious observation is the relative absence of physical pain. Even when situations that must involve a great deal of pain (e.g., Bata's self -emasculation) occur, the experience of pain is not given an explicit narrative statement. One way to think about this is in light of the notion of the \"decorum.\"173 The scarcity of explicit representation of pain in Egyptian monuments suggests that the Egyptians were not very fond of displaying pain in general.174 This could have been out of social concerns,175 but also out of a belief that that the images were potent. It is possible that textual representations were subject to similar constraints. While physical pain is absent (or regarded as unimportant), what we normally as sociate with emotional or mental pain \u2014such as pain caused by injustice, loneliness or sympathy for others \u2014is given explicit representation and contributes to the plot. What does emotional/mental pain have that physical pain does not have? The significance of emotional/mental pain can be better understood when considered in relation to the mimetic (imitated/simulated) frames the 173 The notion of decorum has become quite complex since Bained first adopted it in his 1985 publication (developed from 1976 dissertation on the fecundity figures). More specifically, when Baines first introduced the notio n, it was to give a name to a set of principles that account for the regularity in patterns of iconographic representation in the monuments. Upon noticing \"a complex, tightly structured symbolic system \u2014stricter in demarcations within unitary compositions t han anything familiar from western art,\"( 2007, 16) he suspected that this was related to the Egyptian ideas of and concerns for enacting the proper world order and gave the following definition ( Baines 1990, 20): ...the decorum found on the monuments, which can be traced from late predynastic times, is a set of rules and practices defining what may be represented pictorially with captions, displayed, and possibly written down, in which context and in what form. It can be related to other constraints on action and reports on action...was probably based ultimately on rules or practices of conduct and etiquette, of spatial separation and religious avoidance. Although at first, Baines only applied the concept to the domain of monumental representation, he subsequent ly expanded on the concept to apply to the domain of written texts, and finally to any \"meaningful domains of Egyptian culture.\" The history of development of the notion is given by Baines himself in 2007, 15 -17. As decorum connects the immanent properties particular artifacts to the non -immanent, i.e., social practices, it seems to carry a great explanatory force, and for this reason many Egyptologists have applied decorum as a tool of analysis or an explanatory framework for their research. Recently, howe ver, there has been some criticism against using decorum as an all -encompassing explanatory framework. Cf. Gillen forthcoming. 174 The few known representations are discussed in Prakash 2020. 175 A line from the stela of Uha (OIM E16956. See Teeter 2003, 33 -34), which describes the group circumcision (\"I was circumcised with 120 men, there not being a man whom I struck...\") seems to suggest that refraining from public display of pain was regarded as something honorable in ancie nt Egyptian society. 196 texts take on. For the Peasant or Wermai the frame of petition or letter is very closely connected to pain's making its way into the text. The frame of the petition or the letter is meant to solicit help from those in authority.176 In asking for help, both the peasant and Wermai draw attention to larger evil at a societal level. The kind of pain under consideration here is a rupture in maat that is not confined to individuals. It is better described as social or moral pain, a type o f pain which the ancient audience would have been taught to be sensitive to. The tomb autobiography frame of Sinuhe similarly informs the representational value of emotional/mental pain. The most explicitly represented statements about pain in the text are instances of those who are feeling pain for him as they watch Sinuhe . As the audience (both the purported tomb visitors as well as the broader audience) is in a way watching \u2014be it by hearing, reciting/ reading, or copying \u2014Sinuhe's ordeal, the pain thus rep resented in the text appears as if commenting on the audience's own response. Hence pain in Sinuhe serves as the locus of the chronotopic exchange (the world of the text and the world of the audience converge) as described in the introduction of this chapt er. In light of how widely read/copied Sinuhe was in Egypt, and how it is among the Egyptian literary texts that are most loved/appreciated today, we can also imagine the Middle Kingdom scribes, New kingdom scribes, and modern Egyptologists all coming toge ther and feeling pain for Sinuhe. Ramesside narratives do not make use of the mimetic frames to generate plot in a way comparable to the ME narratives. In Ramesside narratives, heart ( b or ty) + pain ( mr or n) + dative (variations of mr + b + dat ive used in Sinuhe ) inform the audience of the relational dynamic between the characters and of the characters' motivations to action. One of its earliest attestations, dating to the Old Kingdom, is found in the pyramid text (PT 508): mr bs nf s 176 It is performative not exactly in the same way as the incantations examined in the previous chapter are. They are however similar in that both are meant to elicit a hoped -for outcome by words. 197 nf mns snq f sw, \"her heart will be in pain for him, she will give him her breast so that he may suckle it.\"177 Being fed with the mother goddess' breast milk is very important for the restoration/rejuvenation of the newly deceased king. And it is her feeling pain for the king that prompts the mother goddess to suckle the king. Pain here encodes the intimate affection inherent in the mother -son relationship. Whenever the expression is used in the Ramesside narratives, it seems to signify love (more intimate kind than the English word \"sympathy\" carries), which at times appears \"irrational.\" One of the most memorable instances is that of Isis vis -a-vis Seth in Horus and Seth . Isis is always looking out for her son; the bond is very tight, and this is precisely the reason why she opposes Seth. But when she is reminded that Seth is after all her maternal brother, she can't help but feel pain/love for him, too. She lets him off the barb. The action does not align with her intended goal. It actually ends u p costing her, making her Horus very upset. At the same time, there is something good and beautiful about the whole scene, as it seems to suggest that this pain/love is capable of overcoming the bad blood. In short, the kind of pain that made its way into the Egyptian literary narratives is the kind of pain that exists between people, that which is conducive to bringing people together. It is worth noting that while it is the individuals that suffer pain , but the pain suffered by these individuals is not necessarily about themselves . An analogy would help. When you see something with your eyes, although it is your eyes that see, what you see is not yourself (with the exception of self -reflection); when you hear something with your ears, it is your e ars that hear but what you hear is not yourself. Similarly, when you feel pain with your heart, it is your heart that feels pain, but the object of pain is something other than itself. In the next chapter, we shall examine more closely the role of heart in feeling pain. 177 Also discussed in Chapter 2, eg. (101) . 198 CHAPTER 5 Pain in Egyptian Poetry1 5.1 Introduction In this chapter, I continue examining pain in the literary sphere, but turn to two different genres of poetic compositions, the so -called literary laments and the love songs. This chapter is primarily concerned with the ways in which the aesthetics of the Egyptian poetry interact with the experience of pain. Both the literary laments and love songs are works of verbal art that Egyptians considered beautiful: the literary laments are example s of what Egyptians called mdt nfrt, \"beautiful speech\"; the love songs, as indicated by the titles they sometimes bear, sw nm, \"sweet verses.\"2 Albeit in varying degrees and manners, both genres feature the speakers undergoing pain, and this chapter looks at how the verbal artistry contributes to giving shape and substance to the speakers' pain. Towards this goal, I subject the select passages to close reading to delineate the ways in which the elements \u2014 verse structure and parallelism, use of first -person voice, and expressions relating to the heart \u2014work together to capture and enact a type of movement. I suggest this is a kind of movement that b egins deep inside the heart (cognitive and affective), and through the vehicle of artistic (beautiful) speech, becomes transmitted and amplified. Furthermore, I suggest that proper understanding of this movement illuminates the nature of pain involved in b oth genres. 1 Arguably, \"poetry\" or \"poem\" is not the most appropriate term to designate the genre of the texts examined in this chapter. More specifically, in common parlance, poetry or poem is associated with verse structure, which is contrasted with prose. Since some of the texts examined in the previous chapter (such as Sinuhe , the significant portions of the Peasant , or the Tale of Woe ) are also written in verses as well, the label \"poetry\" does not seem to adequately differentiate the texts in this chapter fro m those of the previous chapters. The criteri on I used to here is narrativity/non -narrativity: unlike the texts treated in the previous chapter, the literary laments and the love songs are not primarily concerned with representing a sequence of events. 2 For Indo -European parallels where poetry is characterized as sweet, West 2007, 89 -90. 199 This chapter also addresses the relationship between pain and leisure/entertainment. The aesthetics of these texts are also known to be related to the function of these texts to provide pleasures to the audience. As we have seen from the previ ous chapters, Egyptian texts \u2014 literary and non -literary alike \u2014 require the audience to participate in the reality represented and enacted by the texts in one way or another, which implies the audience of these poems and songs is expected to participate in the experience of pain. It is a curious thing, then, that the texts that are to provide entertainment ask the audience to voluntarily partake in pain. How does the pain experience contribute to entertainment? Is the entertainment achieved by pain or despit e pain? While the full treatment of the topic is well beyond the scope of this dissertation, I would like to use this chapter as an opportunity to broach the topic. 5.2. Literary Laments The literary laments (or, as otherwise known, pessimistic discourse s) refer to a group of texts characterized by the dominant mood of grief and pessimism.3 Besides the overall pessimistic mood, the subject matter can be wide -ranging and the degree of abstraction with which they are dealt varies from text to text.4 Among the topoi that are frequently observed across the corpus include: Asiatic invasion, inversion of social hierarchy and cultural traditions, 3 For an overview of the form and content of the literary laments, see Junge 1977 , 275 -84; Blumenthal 1996, 105 - 135. It should be noted that, just with any kind of Egypti an texts, the literary laments too defy neat classification. In the past when Egyptian literature was primarily divided into wisdom texts and narratives in the manner after the tradition in biblical studies, the laments were treated as the subtype of the w isdom genre. Cf. LA III, 964 -992; the text corpus compiled by Posener (1951, 27 -48 and 1952, 117 -120), which divided Egyptian literature primarily into wisdom texts and narratives). Lichtheim (1997, 1 -8) was the first one to point out this was problematic . More specifically, Lichtheim noticed that though the laments share with other didactic texts their essentially non -narrative nature, unlike didactic texts \u2014which are explicitly framed as giving good advice and inculcating wisdom \u2014they take the form of lengthy monologues (or dialogues) where the wisdom is sought in a more discursive manner. Here, I follow the classification scheme and terminology by Parkinson, who divides Middle Kingdom literature into three groups based on the content: \"narratives/tales \", subsumes the literary laments bunder the last category. See Parkinson 2002, 294 -5. It is worth nothing that unlike \"teachings\" which would continue to develop, albeit taking new forms, in later periods, \"discourses\" do not. 4 Parkinson 2002, 193. 200 breakdown of central kingship, ecological disaster (mostly with an unusual condition of the Nile), moral depravity, prevalence of death, etc.5 The dramatic mode of presentation, in which a first-person speaker laments the horrible things he is witnessing in Egyptian society, imparts immediacy and emotional valency to the texts.6 Often, the first -person speaker would w restle with thorny philosophical/theological questions, such as the problem of evil and theodicy.7 The sense of immediacy and emotional intensity, instead of sacrificing the intellectual rigor, enhances it. In the past, because of the setting and subject matter internal to the texts as well as the classical Middle Egyptian they are written in, the Mid dle Kingdom composition date was widely accepted.8 Moreover, the portrayal of the distraught Egyptian society in these texts was generally accepted as being based on the historical reality of the First Intermediate Period, appropriated by the Middle Kingdom elites for varying purposes, be it political,9 philosophical or literary entertainment.10 In contrast, more recent scholarship appears rather agnostic to questions of the historical accuracy of the representation of Egyptian society in the texts. Instead, recent research 5 Cf. Blumenthal (1996, 108 -124) lists five main motifs of the genre. a) the terrible world; b) reproaches to the god and the god's justification; c) the hopeful world; d) art of speech and wisdom; and e) the individual and the god. 6 Cf. Parkinson 1997, 9. 7 Cf. Parkinson 200, 130 -138; Enmarch 2008, 55 -58. 8 For recent scholarship on dating Middle Egyptian literary texts, see Stauder 2013. 9 The political reading is most famously associated with Posener (1956), so much so that his reading of these texts came to be designated with its own label, \"propaganda model.\" Junge (1977) sees them as ritual ideological fiction, whose details are not real but elaborated, meant to highlight th e role of the king as guarantor of maat . Quack (1997, 353) also regards these texts as political propaganda. Further on the propaganda model of literature, see Parkinson 2002,13 -16. Assmann adds a little more nuance to the account. He regards the Prophecy of Neferti \"neither a historical description nor a ritual ideological fiction; it is codified memory.\" 2003 [1996], 109. Spekaing of the literary laments in general, he adds that they [...]likely reflect the experiences undergone by at least some members of the upper stratum of society during the period of decline and form part of a \"therapeutic\" literary tradition that reaches back to the Sixth and Eighth Dynasties. Every major experience of loss precipitates heightened memory, and this memorializ ing perspective on what has been forfeited gives rise to a construction of the past. Ibid., 110. 10 Cf. Lichtheim1973, 145 -146. 201 seems interested in uncovering some other areas of varying academic interests, such as linguistic dating,11 orality and performance,12 or cultural identity.13 The recognized corpus includes : The Prophecy of Neferti ,14 The Dialogue of Ipuwer ,15 The Lamentations of Khakheperreseneb ,16 The Dialogue of a Man with his Ba ,17 The Discourse of Rensene b, The Discourse of Sasobek ,18 and The Discourse of the Fowler .19 Among these, I shall focus on the first three , and partially the fourth. The last three have been excluded, for they are too fragme nted to be able to identify significant patterns. 5.2.1 Then -and-Now Formulation Grief and anguish expressed in the literary laments is linked to the perennial Egyptian concern for maat , as the collective/common good. We already saw an instance of this in the previous chapter. In the Eloquent Peasant , the peasant's petitions are not only concerned with his 11 Cf. Stauder 2013 . 12 Cf. Enmarch 2008. 13 Cf. Polus -Wegner 2021, 93 -102 links the distinct rhetorical strategies employed in Neferti to reinforcement of the Egyptian cultural and social identity. 14 The text is fully preserved in pPetersburg 1116 B. It also survives in several incomplete copies, whose provenances include both Memphis and Thebes. Translation of the text can easily be found in anthologies such as Lichtheim 1973 and Simpson 2003. Helck 1 992 provides the hieroglyphic transcription. Among the notable studies of the text include Goedicke 1977; Blumenthal 1982, 1 -27. 15 Also known as The Admonitions from Gardiner 1909. It is the longest extant poem in the Middle Egyptian corpus (c. 660 + lost part). The text is preserved on a single Ramesside copy \u2014Papyrus Leiden I 344 \u2014with a missing beginning and end. Refer to Enmarch 2008 for comprehensive literary analysis on the text as well as for references. 16 The principal text is from a writing board (B M EA 5645) dated to the 18th dynasty. An ostracon ( oKairo JE 50249) also preserves a couple parallel lines. Some of the notable studies include: Gardiner 1909, 95 -110; Kadish 1973, 77 -90; Vernus 1995, 1 -33; Parkinson 2002, 200 -2004. Barbotin 2012, 1 -20 is the most recent. Barbotin argues that EA 5645 is a missing beginning to The Dialogue of a Man with his Ba , but see Parkinson 2003 and Escolano -Poveda 2017 for discussion on fragments of the lost beginning. 17 Also known as Lebensm \u00fcde. It is preserved on a s ingle late Middle Kingdom copy, Papyrus Berlin 3024. The text consists of 155 short vertical lines, including the end, but an unknown proportion of the composition at the start is missing. It is one of the most interesting, yet difficult , literary composit ions surviving from ancient Egypt. Many Egyptologists have written about the text. Refer now to Allen 2010 for comprehensive analysis with references. Allen 2015, 327 -359 is an abridged version with hieroglyphic transcription, translation and notes. Parkin son's introduction and notes to his translation of the text included in his anthology (1997, 151 -165) are also valuable. 18 pRamesseum I = BM EA 10754.

At the root of this suffering was the failure of officials to uphold justice , and t he bitterness harbored by the peasant was made particularly poignant by the extensive use of parallelism centered on a paradox: those who are supposed to relieve pain are doing jus t the opposite, i.e., causing pain. This type of parallelism that repeatedly juxtaposes two opposing ideas is widely employed in the literary laments, serving as the main structural and thematic principle. Among such types of antithetical formulations is o ne specific kind that Egyptologists have come to refer to as \"then -now (einst - jetzt) pattern.\"20 It is referred to as such, because the antithesis usually consists of one of the ideal past (then) and one of the current chaos (now).21 Below are examples fr om the texts of Neferti and Ipuwer : Neferti 54 -55 s (w)- The weak man (then) m nb as the lord of force (now), tw <r> n r.t one salutes him (now) n r.t he who used to salute (then). d nk Let me show you [ry] the lowermost (then) r-ry22 as uppermost (now), pr.t m-s what is followed after (now) pr t {} is what (from which) the belly used to turn (then).23 Ipuwer 7, 8ff tm r nf bt He who could not make for himself a coffin (then) m nb t is owner of a tomb (now). 20 Schnekel 1984, 51 -61; Westendorf 1986, 5 -8. 21 The details of imagery do not necessarily need to be taken as portraying contemporary, specific historical situations. They are said to constitute a literary topos of a schematic anti -ideal \"inverted world (verkehrte Welt).\" Enmarch 2008, 19 -20 & 39. For an alternative view, Hassan 2007; E. Morris 2020. 22 This literally becomes true in Coptic. As ehrai means both below and above in Coptic, those who are ehrai are indeed ehrai. 23 This is a rather difficult, convoluted (befitting of the word pr; it seems to mimic the sh ape of the determinative) line. Many different translations have been suggested. For instance, Parkinson (1997, 138) reads \"the man who followed after, now the man leading a generation.\" Tobin (2003, 219) translates \"He who (once) followed obediently now g oes his own way\" has a footnote \"Lit. He who walked behind is one who turns his body.\" In general, pr.ti m -s is taken as the \"then\" component and pr t the \"now\" component. My translation here takes it the other way around. This is not random but in reference to tw <r> n rt n rt earlier which also has the \"now\" element before the \"then\" element. So, there are two sets of chiasmus (then -now-now-then) in this passage. 203 mn nbw wbwt Look, the owners of sepulchers (then), dr r qnr are repelled onto the high ground (now); tm r nf qrs he who could not make for himself a burial (then), m-<nb> -pr- is <owner> of the treasury (now). ... ... mn nb t Look, the owner of property (then), sr b spends the night thirsty (now); db.nf tt f he who begged his dregs for himself (then), m nb s r.w is the owner of sxrw -beer (now). mn nbw y.wt Look, the owners of linen (then) m sy.wt are those of old clothes (now); tm st nf he who could not weave for himself (then), m nb p()q.t is the owner of fine linen (now). ... ... mn wty wytf Look, he who had no shade (then), m nb wyt is the owner of shade (now); nbw wyt the owners of shade (then), m wt n(t) aw are in the darkness of storms (now). About half a century ago, Peter Seibert argued that the use of antithetical statements in literary laments could be traced to the laments of mourners at funerals in captions to funeral scenes in tombs.24 Consider the following examples: TT 137, c aption by the mourning woman at the head of proces sion25 p rs-tp The vigilant (then) m qd is asleep (now); p wty w n gr The one who did not sleep at night (then) sw m nn r nb... he lies weary all day (now).

Cited in Assmann 2005, 114 -115; Enmarch 2013, 96. 204 my is unknowing (now). TT 49, Caption to the group of wailing women27 d mdw n n n wb.wt Words said by the wailing women: mw28 sp sn n wr Lamenting without tiring, y t qyt Oh, the loss. p mnw-nfr The good shepherd (then) , m r t n nm.n k gone to the land of eternity you are taken away (now) . p rmw He who had many people (then) , twk m t mr w you are in the land that loves loneliness (now). p mr wnf rdwyf r m He who loved to stretch his legs to walk (then) , inqt mrw r is bound, wrapped up, hemmed in (now). p pqt mr wn He who had many linens, loved clothing (then) sr m sf n sf is sleeping in yesterday's cast -off clothing (now).29 Later, building upon the observation made by Seibert, Assmann linked the use of the \"then -now pattern\" to the rhetorical purpose of literary laments' presenting the topsy -turvy world as comparable to the state of death.30 Sure, death could be a good thing for the deceased in ancient Egyptian religious belief,31 but for the bereaved, it is marked by irreversible discontinuity, a rupture between yesterday and today. Enmarch has raised doubts about the relationship between literary and non -literary laments, though not specifically against Assmann's argument, saying: \"b eyond a common 27 L\u00fcddeckens 1943, -114 (no.49); Davies 1933, pl.24. 28 Written with [reed leaf + Z 11 + either A -bird or m -bird + standing man with arms stretched above]. Different readings suggested by different translations. The translation given in Davies (1933, 41) has \"praise\" ( iw). L\u00fcddeckens translates as \"wehe.\" 29 Davies 1933, 41 n.13: referring to the bandages of the dead, which were often taken from worn household linen; they offer clear indication of previous use. 30 Assmann 2005, 138 -139. In contrast to Seibert and Assmann , Schenekel (1984, 51 -61) links the formulation to the legal context. Also , they see then -now not as the end, but functioning to build up the expectation to the restoration of the former condition. A -B-A'. Cf. Westendorf 1986, 5 -8. 31 It is however said that starting from the post -Amarna period , i.e., long after these texts were written, the hitherto unambiguously positive portrayal of death in tombs undergoes some shift. Assmann 2005, 3: Firm belief in immortality made it impossible to include songs expressive of pain and sadness, songs that would have immortalized the negative side of death and the realm of death. In the immediate wake of the Amarna Period, however, this taboo was lifted, and the texts sound an entirely new note expressive of pain and sadness. Assmann's insight, while profound, needs to be taken in conjunction with what other scholars have said on the same phenomenon. 205 pessimistic outlook, there is little to explicitly link the liturgical and tomb caption laments with those found in Middle Egyptian literature.\"32 In my view, even if the literary laments did not historically \"inherit\" the rhetorical structu re from the funerary laments, Assmann's insight that the literary laments convey the sense of discontinuity comparable to that observed in the funerary laments can still be of relevance on the thematic grounds. As I hope to demonstrate below, in both funer ary and literary laments, then -and-now formulation is employed to capture and enact some kind of movement, which has both verbal and bodily components. In my analysis, I foreground this sense of movement as a main component of a form of pain, commonly know n as grief. Starting from the funerary laments seems appropriate from a heuristic point of view. In general, it is easier for an average modern reader to relate to the pain resulting from the loss of loved ones than to the pain resulting from the loss of maat . One cou ld use what is found from the poetics of the funerary laments as a springboard to start thinking about the poetics of the literary laments. The caption to the wailing women in the TT 49 example cited above is but a part of a larger scene, which also inclu des the mourning widow of the deceased. Accompanying the widow are: TT 49, Caption to the mourning widow33 wyt rk m - m w.kw r swt p mr gr {wt}? bw mdw k ...far away; how can you do that? I may go, being alone, but with you and behind you (?) One who loved to chat with me (then), you are silent, you do not speak (now)! 32 Enmarch 2013, 97. Enmarch's reasoning is that antithetical formulation is not unique to the funerary laments but is also seen in other genres such as hymns and eulogies. To this, Enmarch also adds that while the literary laments were composed before Amarn a, then -now formulation is not employed in the funerary laments from the pre -Amarna tombs. He then argues that Middle Egyptian literary works should not be seen as direct transcriptions of oral compositions and that there was probably a complex relationshi p between the lost oral poetry and the partly attested literature where each affected the other. See also Enmarch 2008, 45. 33 L\u00fcddeckens 1943, 109 -111 (no.48); Davies 1933, pl.24. 206 Presumably, what is being communicated by the widow's lament here is not just the fa cts described as such. The facts are deceptively simple. The man was once alive, now he is dead. It is also difficult to characterize what is going on here as simply a \"pessimistic outlook.\" What adds depth to the deceptively simple facts or a pessimistic outlook is the widow's pain/grief. The words here convey the relentless pain of loss and bitterness of the bereavement. The then -now pattern, I suggest, dramatizes the widow's experience, by simulating the movement the widow's heart/mind is forced to make, oscillating from one end to the other end. The sense of harmony or union that long characterized their relationship is now ruptured by death.34 The widow is not just sad but also confused.35 As an analogy, consider how it makes one feel disoriented/dizzy when forced to move from one place to another quickly. Motion sickness happens \"when the movement you see is different from what your inner ear senses.\"36 The widow's disorientation as convey ed by the then -now formulation points to something similar. Against her will, her mind moves from one pole to another. The key here is to think of the two poles not in respect to the objective point of reference, but in respect to \"I.\" It is not simply tha t random man or general somebody was once alive and is now dead. It is the man who used to be with me and is no longer with me.37 While the wailing women may not feel exactly the same way as the widow, the sorrow would have been shared, nonetheless. Emoti on is known to be contagious. It is most commonly 34 Cf. The relationship between Bata and Anubis as discussed in Chapter 4. 35 If we recall the passage from Sinuhe (cited in Chapter 4), where it describes the mourning in the Residence, which is characterized by static and calm mood, the widow's grief here is closer to Sinuhe's restlessness. 36 CDC website. One source describes \" a discontinuity between either visual, proprioceptive, and somatosensory input, or semicircular canal and otolith input.\" Kohl 1983. Another source describes it as that which occurs \"when there is a mismatch between actual versus expected sensory inputs.\" Takov and Tadi 2021. 37 For somebody who has just experienced a loss, this oscillation happens over and over again. The moment you think you've adjusted to the new reality of not having the person in your life, another piece of memory surfaces, \"oh, he use d to do this,\" \"he used to hate that,\" etc, that makes you feel all over again how real he is/was. 207 observed among infants and young children. One baby starts crying, soon all the babies in the room are crying. 38 Emotional contagion is known to be stronger among those who are \"similar\" (i.e., share close interpersonal/social ties). Mourning women usually consisted of the close relatives.39 What distinguishes from the \"one baby crying -soon all the babies crying situation\" from the funerary lament is, of course, for the latter, crying is accompanied by wo rds.40 While the mourning women's laments do not sound as intimate and personal as the widow's lament,41the similar sense of disorientation is conveyed by the same then -now pattern that enacts the oscillating movement between two poles of then and now. Lam enting in group facilitates the transfer of the emotion between people.42 Not that the current usage of the word emotion retains its etymology, (e + movere ), but it reminds us: there maybe after all a notion of movement built into the word. To feel or have an emotion is to undergo a certain type of motion. And when the person undergoing this type of motion does not keep the motion within oneself but lets it out in a public sphere, those who hear are also drawn into the orbit of this motion. As represented in the tomb in captions, the lament of the widow and that of the wailing women are kept separate. In 38 Scientists attribute this to mirror neurons, \"a class of neuron that modulate their activity both when an individual executes a specific motor act and when they observe the same or similar act performed by another individual.\" Kilner and Lemon 2013. Growing research suggests that automatic mimicry activated by mirror neurons may be closely implicated in empathy. Prochazkova and Kret 2017. 39 Enmarch 2013, 86 -87. In Ptolemaic Egypt, however, they could be hired in. See Cannata 2021. 40 Cf. Nagy 2020, 63 -74. Nagy is a classicist, but his works can provide insight to those working with laments in other areas. See also Austin 2021 whichs is also on lament and grief in Homer but takes a very different approach from Nagy. 41 The deceased is mostly referred by the participles, or f, though also by k a few times. The title (and instruction?) suggests this could be part of a repertoire, which some people may be tempted to think of as a sign of lack of spontaneity. 42 L\u00fcddeckens (1943, 183) notes that male professional mourners express conventional confidence in afte rlife; while the dead man's wife, expressing personal loss and longing, displays pessimism. According to Sweeney (2002, 44 - 5), expression of grief was deemed more appropriate for female than for male. 208 reality, however, their laments would not have been kept separate as they would have occurred in the same place.43 With this is mind, we return to the literary laments. Note, I am not here suggesting that these were performed as a part of ritual; the exact nature and degree of emotions also would have been different. Even so, the then -and-now pattern can still be viewed as enacting and facilitati ng the similar movement in the audience of the literary laments. Here, we do need a stretch of imagination. Recall from the Introduction Bakhtin's notion of the secondary genre and the idea of dialogicity. The literary laments serve as the medium through w hich grief becomes increasingly shared: not just my pain, but our pain. A wave of (e)motion travels through the mourners across generations. A metaphor? Maybe. It does not make the grief any less real though. 5.2.2 A Call to Weep Unsurprisingly, referenc es to weeping are prevalent in the literary laments. The topos of the land in destruction often includes the weeping that is heard throughout the land: Ipuwer 3, 13 -14 w ms sb q.w [n-] r.twf im pw nty t t bn r nwt O yet laughter perished, [is no] longer done. It is mourning44 which is throughout the land , mixed m nw r-nb twt r w The land is passing in pain,45 there are lamentations everywhere . Towns and districts are in mourning , all people are united under crime. In Ipuwer , the weeping and mourning are extended to the animals and the god(s): 43 I do not mean they were necessarily said all at once. It could have taken an antiphonal form. In fact, the term n n wbwt seems to have derived from the wailing womens' responsorial role. 44 Vocal demonstration of grief. Enmarch 2008, 93. 45 See Chapter 2. 209 w nmw r m r wrwf O yet, all herds46 their hearts weep, cattle mourn because of the state of the land. O yet children of officials are thrown against the walls, children of prayer being placed on high ground, Khnum mourns because of his weariness. Not only does the text describe the weeping already taking place, but it also calls forth for weeping: Ipuwer 10, 3 - 4 rmy rf t-mw n royal storehouse is free -for-all47 for everyone, the entire royal estate lph is without48 its revenues. Ipuwer 16, 13 -14 q r wt k wbd twt... Let the gods weep, their followers enter against Ka-chapels, statues being burned... This call to weep is most interestingly developed in the prophesy in Neferti , and it is worth looking into the text as a whole to see how this works. The frame narrative of Neferti is set in the time of Sneferu. Neferti is summoned by the pharaoh with the expectation that he would deliver 46 The word wt evokes the mankind, as humankind is often referred to as the cattle of the creator god. E .g., Meriakre E 130 -131; Westcar 8, 17. See Enmarch 2008, 107. 47 Lit. \"Should I go down, it would be brought to me.\" Also in Ipuwer 6, 9: nt n kmt m h n.tw n , \"The grain of Egypt is a free for all.\" hy and n here are likely to be referring to what the Peasant is doing in R 1, 2 -3: mt w m ht r kmt r nt qw m n rdw, \"Look, I am going down to Egypt in order to fetch grains therin for my children.\" It is used as an idiomatic expression similar to the way s q, \"go and plunder\" is used to refer to easy prey. See Hoch 1997, \u00a7194. Cf. Parkinson 1997, 195 n. 82; Enmarc h 2008, 119 and 163. It is worth noting that both hy and n have deictic meaning, being projected from the viewpoint of those who do not dwell in the \"center.\" Contrast the way the pharaoh in the Peasant refers to the peasant's ht and nt in B1 112 -114: mk w w m n n sty r wt pr f r...wnn k r rdt d.tw n f qw, \"Look, one of those peasants comes to the land (Egypt) because of the emptiness of his house...You shall have the grains given to him...\" 48 GEG \u00a7178. 210 beautiful speech for entertainment.49 Befo re he begins, Neferti recollects,50 and when he begins, he begins by addressing his own heart: Neferti 17 -21 wf mf r prt m qni n btt p ws k r ntt m -bk He ponders the events in the land, he recalls the turmoil of the East, the Asiatics wandering in their strength, terrorizing harvesters' hearts, seizing the cattle from ploughing. He says: Pound, my heart, and weep for this land, that which you began therein, Silence is what overwhelms(?)51 Look, what is said of it should (inspire) respect, Look, the official will be laid low, do not be weary.52 Look, this is in front of you, May you attend to what is before you. The five units preceding df describe the act of recollecting and the content thereof. Notice the first two units both beginning with wf are syntactically and semantically parallel, but the object of the second wf clause specifies the object of the first wf clause: Neferti is thinking about the events in the land, more specifically, the turmoil of the East. It has the effect of zooming in. The next three units do not have the introductory wf, and syntactically could be taken as subordinated to the object of the second wf clause. They add descriptive details to the \"turmoil 49 See the Excursus at the end of this chapter. 50 For Indo -European parallels for poetic activity being characterized as an act of calling to mind, see West 2007, 33-35. 51 In addition to its primary meaning \"to sprinkle with water, to moisten\" ( Wb. I, 57.1 -8), w also has an extended meaning of \"libati on\" and \"bathing\" ( Wb. I, 57.9). This has resulted in a wide variety of translations by different scholars. Refer to the list compiled by Dils in TLA: https://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/servlet/S02?wc=172496&db=0 . I am following Parkinson 1997a. Parkinson sees this line as involving double imagery centered on water: 1) to be silent here is to not weep, and 2) weeping involves lot of tears, which the Egyptians see it as a form of water, which is appropriate the subject of predicate iw. While silence is considered as a virtue, to be silent and not speak out when it requires, is not right. See the discussion on the Peasant in Chapter 4. 52 Cf. the caption to the wailing women from TT49 cited above: nww n wr. 211 of the East.\" Things are getting more real with each clause. The spontaneity and directness add poignancy to the speech. The prophesy proper starts with the imperative ws followed by vocative b.53 The word ws is commonly is used in the context of building a monument, and has the meaning of pounding, beating.54 With the heart as the subject of the action, we can understand perhaps its meaning in relation to the pounding motion and sound of the heartbeat: Neferti is telling his heart to beat louder or faster.55 What is of greater interest is the rmk that follows. The referent of the 2ms suffix pronoun is undoubtedly the heart. As a subjunctive following the imperative, it continues the force of the imperative from the previous ws: Neferti is telling his pounding heart to weep. The object t pn refers back to t from the frame narrative ( prt m t) and serves to tighten the sense of continuity carrying over from the frame narrative to the content of Neferti's speech. However brief, these two clauses forcefully arrest the attention and effectively establish an anticipation that the \"prophesy\" will u nfold in the form of Neferti's speech to his own heart. The audience (both internal and external) is only overhearing this talk. For the rest of the text, the same frame of Neferti's direct address to his own heart is maintained. At various points punctua ting the prophesy is the phrase di nk. By presenting what he sees through the mind's eyes via speech, he tries to elicit from his heart to weep. Neferti 38 -39 d nk t pn m sny -mn tm pr pr... Let me present to you, the land in catastrophe, what should not happen, happens... Neferti 44 -45 d nk Let me present to you 53 Alternatively, it could be analyzed as a prospective smf, \"may my heart pound.\" 54 Wb. III, 248.4 -249.5; Cf. Posener 1956, 149 -150. 55 Alternatively, as the word wsi also has the meaning \"to stir, mix in a vessel,\" we can also understand what Neferti is telling the heart to do is to stir all the thoughts that are going through his mind (as conveyed by the verbs m and s). 212 s m rwy the son as attacker, sn m fty the brother as enemy, s r sm tf man murdering his father. Neferti 47 d nk nb m nhp rwty tp Let me present to you the lord in sorrow, outsider in peace. Neferti 54 d nk t m sny -mny s (w)- m nb Let me present to you the land in catastrophe, the weak man as the lord of force... Neferti 55 d nk Let me present to you , [ry] r -ry that which is below, that which is above, pr.t m-s pr t{} The man who followed after, now the man leading a generation... We may ask why Neferti is intent on inducing his heart to weep. Informing us are the following lines which describe the devastating future that Neferti foresees, marked by absence of weeping: Neferti 24 nn m rf nn d nn r rmw Destroyed is this land, no one cares about it, no one speaks out, no one sheds tears. Notice the verbs used here all echo the very acts that Neferti himself is engaged in. nn m rf is matched by wf mf r prt t pn in lines 17 -18, nn d n is matched by df in line 20 and nn ir rmw is matched by rmk tv pn also in line 20. I shall come back to the significance of this mirroring shortly below. For now, attention needs to be drawn to how this absence of weeping contrasts with the universal weeping as seen in the examples from Ipuwer and Khakherreseneb cited a bove. Usually, the land being destroyed is accompanied by a lot of weeping. Since a lot of weeping means a lot of suffering and pain, if there is no one weeping, should not this be taken as a positive thing, since there is less pain? But, here, Neferti is pointing out something else. Later 213 in the text, there are two more passages that refer or allude to absence of weeping, both of which also feature the series of nn: smt mjn b snj rs r-w Death will not be wept at, Death will be not fasted for, the heart of a man being only after himself.56 Mourning57 will not be made today,58 the heart having turned away from it entirely. Neferti 51 -53 [w] m mw Re separates himself from mankind. Though he would rise when it is time, the occurring of midday will not be known, his shadow will not be distinguished, face will not be bright when looked upon, eyes will not moisten with water. The first passage points out the abnormality of absence of weeping for death. Death should be mourned. Not only is this a natural response (i.e. , you are inclined to do it as part of human nature), but it is also the right thing to do (i.e. , if you do not want to do it, you need to). It is a form of affection and a sign of social solidari ty. When people are selfish, however, they stop responding to something as serious as death by mourning. Absence of weeping is therefore a sign of prevalent selfishness, not less suffering. Absence of weeping takes on a cosmological meaning in the second passage. To be sure, here no explicit reference to weeping is made, but allusion is rich. The passage alludes to the mythical rebellion of mankind. 59 Angered at mankind's rebellion against him, the sun god slaughters them and then decides to separa te himself from mankind by leaving the earth for the 56 Evil of selfishness is most extensively developed in Man and Ba , especially the \"Who can I talk to today\" litany. 57 Lit. disheveled hair. 58 Referring to future as \"today\" conveys the presentational immediacy. 59 Parkinson 1997, 141 -142 n. 22; Parkinson 1997, 233 214 sky.60 Nn clauses spell out the consequences of the sun's withdrawal from the land, one of which is the eyes do not moisten with water. It also alludes to the mythical account of the creation of mankind . Though the word r(m)t in line 51 refers to the mankind, wherever Re as the creator god is involved, even if it is not meant explicitly, the word's association with rmyt, \"tears\" is inevitably echoed. 61 According to Ritner, the pun between the two is no t a random phonetic accident in Egyptian theology; words are divine creations, so the pun expresses an underlying cosmic linkage between the two concepts.62 Weeping and mankind are linked cosmologically. Based on this, we may then proceed to understand los s of tears with loss of humanity. Weeping is what makes man man, both cosmo -mythologically and ethically. For Neferti, the absence of weeping in the face of destruction of the land is a destruction on another level. Note that despite the immediacy and viv idness of Neferti's account, he is not himself directly experiencing the catastrophe. He is seeing it and presenting it as now, but that now is not now. I suggest that this is not merely a literary device, but something closely linked to the rhetorical goa l of the text as a call to weep. Dramatic presentation invites dramatic interpretation; Neferti's deep and circumspect intuiting of events provide a model to emulate for the audience.63 The audience, when presented with Neferti's words, is invited to \"see\" these events though their heart. And just like Nerferti who takes what he \"sees\" to his own heart to weep, the audience is invited to do the same. If the then -and-now formulation serves as a more \"raw\" vehicle for 60 Cf. The Myth of the Heavenly Cow . The mytheme of repression of the rebellion recurs in Merikare (E 133 -134; Quack 1992, 95) and the Calendar of Good and Bad Days (specifically, month 1, inundation seaso n, day 12). See Leitz 1994, 23 -25. 61 In CT 1130, the creator announces: \"From my sweat I created the gods. Mankind ( rm) is from the tears ( rmyt) of my eye.\" On a related note, lines 22 -23 which reads r m grg t qw r-w n pr t, \"may Re begin to recreate, for the land is ruined entirely, no remnant exists\" could be alluding to Re's weeping as well. Since the mankind came from Re's tears, with everyone gone, recreation of mankind would seem to require yet another round of weeping by Re. 62 Ritner 2022, 86. 63 Cf. Ipuwer 1, 8: m rtiw m - prt m t, \"the possessor of characters goes in mourning because of what happened in the land.\" 215 lamenting, this ironic framing motivates it intellectually. It adds a great evocative force, inducing audiences to use their imaginations in reliving the events and live out the drama in their own context. 5.2.3 Pain and Introspection The text known as Khakheperreseneb echoes a number of themes and motifs featured in Neferti,64 but Khakheperreseneb delivers them in a more introspective manner.65 Though lacking a frame narrative like Neferti, the text is preceded by the title that is suggestive of its contemplative character: r nw m n b \"probing of the matters/utterances by (means of) searching of the heart.\"66 Owing to this title, the text has been variously described as a soliloquy/dramatized monologue, or an interior dialogue. In what follows, I shall focus on two sets of repet ition, that progressively deepen the introspection and render dynamic the experience of pain. After the introductory df, the speech begins with ni, \"if only,\"67 an expression characteristic of deploring one's situation: Khakh. rto. 2 -4 df n nw mm/68 sw m mdt m (w)t tmt sw / He says: If only I had unknown utterances and extraordinary69 verses, in a new speech that does not pass away... 64 Parkinson 1997, 144. 65 To be sure, Neferti is also very introspective, as the content of the prophesy is a result of recollection of his mind, and the whole speech is framed as an address to his own heart. 66 Different translations suggested by others include: Gardiner (1909, 97), \"...with ingenious mind\"; Kadish (1973, 77), \"the searching for phrases in racking the brain\"; Parkinson (1997a, 146), \"the seeking of utteran ces with heart - searching\"; Simpson (2003, 212), \"the search for words by an inquisitive mind.\" On the argument structure of , Winand 2016. 67 See the discussion on Wermai in the previous chapter on this particle. It is further discussed below in the discussion of the love songs. 68 / marks the verse point (red dot). 69 Wb. III, 259.14 -15. 216 The speaker -poet laments the difficulty in finding the right words to express his anguish. The speech here is highly self -referential: it is a speech that is searching for a speech, yet itself already being that speech.70 \"If only\" occurs two more times. It functions like a leitmotif organizing the poem.71 A development or progression of a theme can be observed from one occurrence to another. If the first \"if only\" has introduced the problems of speech as the topic, the second \"if only\" adds on to the old topic a new one: Khakh. rto. 7 -9 r m.n kywy/ / wn nf psd / nw m sfn{.n} w ... If only I knew what was unknown to others, what is still unrepeated, I would say them so that my heart would answer me, that I may enlighten it about my pain, and transfer to it the burden which is on my back, the matters, namely, that which afflict me...72 Here it is revealed that the reason the speaker wishes he had innovative utterances is because he deems it would have an effect of unloading the burden onto his heart.73 The third \"if only\" occurs at the end of the recto: Khakh. rto. 13 -14 n b m r wdw/ k r.y sn rf/ r/ dr nf mn / If only I had a heart which understands suffering, then I would alight on it,74 I would load it with words of misery,75 and drive away my pain onto it. 70 Cf. Parkinson 1997, 144. This results in a highly convoluted line like rto. 5: n d d d d.t(y) fy/ \"no speaker has spoken yet. May one who will speak now speak.\" 71 To be sure, these divisions do not correspond the formal division into three \"paragraphs\" that the text on the recto is arranged in. Each paragraph consists of four to five lines. Paragraph 1 (rto. 1 -4); paragraph 2 (rto. 5 -9) (has the date bd 2 mw sw 28 in red ink at the end); paragraph 3 (rto. 10 -14). See pls. xxxii -iii in Kadish 1973. The first if only occurs at the beginning of the first paragraph, the second if only occurs in the middle of the second paragraph, and the third if only occurs towards the end of the third paragraph. 72 Kadish 1973, 81 n.z. 73 Reminiscent of the peasant seeking to let it all out. See the previous chapter. 74 For the sequence of -k, see G EG \u00a7243. It is also discussed below for the love songs. 75 For mr, refer back to Chapter 2; n.84 below. 217 On the surface, it seems to reiterate what has already been said in the previous section (e.g. , unloading the pain onto his heart), but now what the speaker wishes to have is not the utterances, but the heart that understands suffering ( b m r wdw ).76 This development can be understood in relation to the passage interposed between the second and the third \"if only.\" Rto 10 begins with the statement nk pw Hr nk y m prt/ srw pr t t , \"It is that I am contemplating on what has happened,77 the state of things that have occurred throughout the land.\" This is then followed by the series of antithetical statements describing the land in calamity.78 This passage consisting of the antithetical statements are the utterances that the speaker was wishing that he had earlier. By the third \"if only,\" he has managed to churn them out.79 But instead of being relieved of the burden as he hoped, the speaker continues to suffer.80 It turns out the problem is not about having the right utterances, but about having the heart that can endure. This paves the way to the text of the verso. Unlike the recto, the verso consists of one long paragraph. In the verso, \"if only\" does not occur anymore. After the introductory df n bf, which echoes the introductory df on the recto, the heart is directly addressed, in imperative + subjunctive: Khakh. vso. 1 76 Or \"able to endure,\" or \"knows patience.\" Observe how the repetition plays with the contrast between r and m. n nw mm > rj m.n kywy > n b m r wdw. Hence, m > r- m > r. 77 The use of ink pw is here a little puzzling. Customarily, it has been translated \"I contemplate on\" or \"I am contemplating on,\" etc., but such translations do not capture the sense conveyed by the nominal nk pw . The nominal sentence in the midst of subj unctives jumps out. Refer to Hoch \u00a7144 for nk pw used in explanations. The writing of nky presents a grammatical challenge. It is followed by the seated man determinative (also found on the parallel line in oKairo), but in the pseudo -verbal construction , the determinative is superfluous. The same sentence occurs again in verso 1, but without a seated man determinative. Cf. Barbotin 2012, 13, n.62 78 Rto. 10 -12. 79 Cf. rto. 3: sk t r ntt ms/ m f n d nb, \"I shall filter my body on account of what it is in it, by releasing of all speech.\" Note the verb sk (Wb. 4, 268.5 -8; MedWb 792 f) is not very well attested and is mostly known from medical texts, which makes it likely to be a medical metaphor. 80 Rto. 13. Cf. Parkinson 1997a, 149 n.8. 218 df n bf/ nk/ wbk n s[w] / wk n n nty t t... He says to his heart: O come, my heart, that I may speak to you. May you answer me my verses, may you explain to me the things upon the land... sw refers back to the antithetical statements from the recto, but also anticipates yet another series of antithetical statements, which follow immediately after and continue till the end.81 Here, Khakheperreseneb expresses his suffering in most direct manner , using many of the words surveyed in Chapter 2: Khakh. vso. pw gr r sm.t/ h pw wb n m/ One wakes up to suffering every day, long and heavy is my pain, without strength for the miserable, (for) saving him from the one stronger than him,82 silence against what is heard is a disease, but the answer of the ignorant is pain. The poem concludes with the speaker returning to address his heart: Khakh. vso. 5 -6 d bk m nb/ {t} wdn rk/ I speak to you, my heart, that you shall answer me. A touched heart cannot be silent. Look, the servant's needs are like the master's, many things are weighing upon you. These closing lines with obvious echoes to the previous lines attest to the coherence and completeness of the poem as a whole. For my purpose, I would like to draw attention to the development from df (rto.1), df n bf (vso.1) and now, d nk b (vso.5). As a form of Chinese box construction, the development can be seen as a mimetic frame for introspection.83 81 Vso. 1 -5. As in the recto, here too the description of the calamity is preceded by nk pw r nk m prt. 82 Previous translations all suggest what's happening here is the weak having no strength to protect/save himself against the strong. E .g., Parkinson 1997a, 48: \"the pauper has no strength to <save powerful man.\" Barbotin 2012, 'indigent n'a pas le pr\u00e9serverait de plus puissant que lui.\" They all insert sw after nmf (or sometimes reconstructed m<k>t f) for this line of translation. But the miserable/wretched never had really had the strength to save himself against the powerful even during the good days; that's what why the elites had to protect them. See the examples listed in Chapter 2 under mr, especially the example #51. I am wondering if the speaker is lamenting his own lack of strength to protect the weak. 83 Akin to the structure of the Shipwrecked sailor. 219 To elaborate, not only do these phrases serve to introduce a speech, but they also each constitute an event of speech (a quotation within a quotation within a quotation). Taken individually, they are three different frames, representing three different speech events. But when strung together, they create but one unified frame that dramatizes the theme of the poem, ar nw m y b, \"probin g of the matters/utterances by (means of) searching of the heart \" mentioned in the title. Also, notice another set of interlocking repetition: wb n b (rto. 7), wbk n s[w] (vso.1), and to wbk n (vso.5). With each iteration, the speak er presses the heart further. The frame seems to be simulating that journey which progressively moves deeper into, or grows closer to one's innermost being which is the heart.84 How does this progressively introspective frame relate to the experience of p ain? Even when the similar/same things are said, when directly addressed to the heart, the vocative character renders the meaning of the utterances to be more deeply/personally felt. To illustrate, consider how one is often advised to not take something to o personally; by not taking it personally, one is spared of getting hurt. What we see in Khakheperresenb is just the opposite: one should take the affairs that are already afflicting you more personally. By taking closer to the heart (the goal is to p b as indicated by vso. 5), you are to feel more pain. Invitation to feel more pain appears counter intuitive. A line from the later Demotic wisdom text may provide a clue: \"suffering of heart and tongue is that which causes a prophet to come into being.\"85 Could it be that the Egyptians associated suffering of heart with acquisition of wisdom and knowledge? 5.3 Pain in Egyptian Love Songs 84 Cf. The phrase \"my heart spoke to me\" for inner dialogue and \"the Chamber of Darkness\" in the Book of Thoth, Jasnow and Zauzich 2020, 22 -23. 85 Jasnow and Zauzich 2020, 105. The Book of Thoth describes the aspiration for knowledge in passionate term. The pain and suffering that needs to be endured by the disciple is not just of suffering of heart and tongue but of the entirety of the being, which involves a high degree of abstinence and self -discipline. Ibid., 18 -19 & 21 -22. 220 Egyptian love songs are lyrical compositions that are often found in small groups (variously referred to as s ong collections or cycles). A currently recognized corpus consists of ninety -four individual songs, scattered on three papyri, a vase, and a few dozen ostraca.86 All the extant songs are known from Ramesside copies (between the Nineteenth Dynasty and the Twentieth Dynasty; circa 1300 and 1100 BCE), although scholars trace their origin as early as the Eighteenth Dynasty.87 To date, the copies have been exclusively found from the region of Western Thebes, and the great majority of them are from the workmen's village of Deir el - Medina.88 The term \"love songs\" is a modern attribution, but not all that inappropriate, because they are songs about love. As characteristic of Egyptian compositions, the subject matter is not dealt in abstract but shown in concrete forms, in this case by showing t hose in love. Typical songs feature a pair of young couple, who refer to one another as sn, \"brother\" and snt, \"sister,\" and at least one and sometimes both of whom are desperately in love. Their love takes place against the backdrop of bucolic landscapes and domestic environments, often with paraphernalia of festivals and banquets. Amidst the lush vegetation, overlooking the Nile, with birds and flowers, lovers 86 The four extant major collections are the Papyrus Harris 500 (=pBM 10060), the Turin 25218), and the Chester Beatty Papyrus I (=pBM 10681). For the full list of the extant songs and their provenance, refer to Mathieu 1996, 19 -21. 87 Their brief attestation in the written records has been the source of great puzzlement for scholars. Early commentators like Erman (1923, 303), Gardiner 1957 (1957, 24) and Hermann (1959, 1, 9 -35) all considered it possible that love poems had much earlie r origins. More recently, Vachala (2002, 182 -183) has suggested the existence of love songs as early as the Old Kingdom, based on a fragment of a love song as a label of a harpist in the tomb of Inti at Abusir and in the tomb of Mereruka. Parkinson (2002, 226-232) posits Tale of the Herdsman (12th Dyn.) and the Pleasures of Fishing and Fowling (18th Dyn.), which represent mythical and pastoral traits and praising the benefits of agriculture as a source of life and pleasure, as possible literary precursors. Finally, Ragagzzoli (2008, 135 -137) notes the close parallels between the love songs and the eulogies of cities. These differences in view exist, not simply because differenct scholars have different ancient materials available to them, but also because th ey differ on i) criteria for love songs, and ii) what counts as literary love songs. For instance, Parkinson's suggestion seems to reflect his view that love songs belong to a larger genre of lyrical poems. 88 pHarris 500 (pBM 10060) was found with other p apyri in a box in the Ramesseum, while pChester Beatty I was found as part of the Qenherkhepeshef archive collection in the necropolis of Deir el -Medina. The concentration of texts in Deir el -Medina may be explained by chance preservation and does not indi cate that they were exclusively consumed there. 221 delight in the presence of one another. Extensive use of imagery and figurative language imbues the songs with their characteristic rich and immersive quality, melding the lovers with the setting, with one another, and with the audience. Frequent references to things like wine, fragrant oil or luxurious linen present the experience as sensual and int oxicating. Their affinity with the Biblical Song of Songs has been noted for over a century, since the early days of their discovery,89 and this has invited a high degree of comparative interest, which is quite unusual for Egyptian texts.90 Michael V. Fox 's 1985 comparative study of the Egyptian love songs and the Song of Songs remains one of the most comprehensive and insightful literary studies on the Egyptian love songs.91 The comparative perspective he brings to the examination of the Egyptian corpus n ot only sheds light on the universal aspect, but also casts into sharper relief the features that give Egyptian love songs their unique flavor. Most significantly, he identifies the introspective quality of the Egyptian loves songs as their hallmark featur e, based on his observation that compared to the outward looking Biblical lovers, the Egyptian lovers are far more focused on exploring their own feelings and thoughts occasioned by love. He notes: The Egyptian lovers are fascinated by love, amazed at its power and its sensations. In attempting to show how love feels, the Egyptian poems characteristically use introspective reports on the speakers' emotions... we get the impression of lovers taking their own emotional pulses and revealing what love does to th em...lovers dwell upon their own emotions, approaching their feelings from many angles and trying to grasp them in various ways, as if to pin them down. It seems important to the lovers (and to the poets behind them) to communicate just what is going on insi de. In contrast, the urgency of the lovers in Canticles is to tell what they see in each other.92 Introspective reports are something we have seen over and over again in the literary narratives 89 The resemblance was readily noticed by the scholars who made the first hieroglyphic transcriptions of the corpus. Maspero 1883, 47; Muller 1899, 8. 90 White 1975; Fox 1985. 91 Mathieu 1996 offers a more through grammatical and philological treatment of the texts. But as far as both text - critical exegesis with sensitivity to literary artistry and the broader literary discussions go, Fox's work has not been surpassed. 92 Fox 198 5, 325 -326. See also 259 -261; 278 -280; 327 -330. 222 (Chapter 4) as well as in the literary laments examined in t he first half of this chapter. We have also seen the importance of the physician's examination of the heart as the indicators of what is going on deep inside the patient's body (Chapter 3). It is therefore very interesting that Fox would refer to them as \" emotional pulses.\" For the analysis of pains that accompany love, I shall continue to rely on these introspective reports, but just as I have done with the literary laments, I will look at them in close relation to the overall rhythm of the texts. In very general terms, all longing can be understood as rising from a certain lack: out there is something or someone you want, but you do not fully (currently and/or lastingly) possess that someone or something. And to not have what you want, many would agree, c an be painful. Again, in very general terms, all longing can be thought of as involving some kind of movement/motion: out there is something or someone that draws or pulls you, and instead of resisting that force, you are submitting to the force. In this s ense, l onging can be conceived of as one and the same pulling motion initiated by the object, but seen from the subject's perspective. Across the corpus, we frequently come across the speakers who are in the state of lack and are undergoing the longing movement as they speak.93 They would have the lovers present in their mind (words for \"remembering,\" \"thinking of\" are very common), but at the same time are very aware of the distance between the longed -for state and current reality. As in literar y laments, the distance between the current state and the ideal creates tension,94 giving rise to the poetic movement: they pine. The following analysis focuses on the interface between the formal features of poetry which both capture and enact the speaker 's pining. 5.3.1 \"If Only...\" 223 In the following poem, a male speaker gets a peek at the girl he likes through the door, which then leads him to indulge in a daydream: Harris 500 2, 11 -13 (= Fox no.7)95 p bn n snt The mansion96 of sister, her entry is in the middle of her house, her double -doors open, bolt drawn back, and the sister is angry! If only I were appointed doorkeeper, I would have made her be mad at me, but then I shall listen to her angry voi ce, I being (like) a child in fear of her. pys r m r-b pys sm rws qnd.t rd n ryts The poem can be divided into two halves, which are held together by the motif of the door and door-keeper (, ry-) and the girl being angry ( qnd.t ). The first half presents what the boy sees \u2014the architectural setting, 98 the door,99 and the girl. The second half, which begins with the optative particle l, \"if only,\"100 presents what the boy wishes. A certain shift can be observed from the first half to the second half. If attention is directed outwardly to the world in the first half, in the second half, attention is directed inwardly to the boy's desire. Although one may think of the first half as simply providing the background setting for (i.e. , it is incidental to) the 95 Note on the transliteration and translation: Transliteration is largely based on the transcription and transliteration by Mathieu 1996. Translation is mine, having consulted Fox 1985 translation and the philological commentaries in Mathieu 1996 and TLA. 96 Compared to pr, bn has a more \"bucolic\" feel to it. It is what Bata builds in the Cedar Valley. The word also appears in the Pleasures of Fishing and Fowling as well as in the Late Egyptian Miscellanies (pAnastasi IV rto. 8, 9; pLansing rto. Mathieu's transcription (pl.9) has: ry st nn r. He treats on ry as an error and takes nn as an emphatic with focus on ri, yielding, \"c'est contre moi qu'elle gronderait!\" White 1978, 171 \"I would make her angry at me.\" Popko (TLA note on the passage) points out that for White's translation to work, something like ry nnst r or d nnst ri. I am here t aking the entire st nn r as the object of ry st. This is interesting and may require a closer look for the grammar can tell about the Egyptian understanding of emotion. Can a person (A) directly make someone (B) get angry, or is A causing a situ ation where B gets angry? ern\u00fd and Groll (1993, 197-198) list verbs for ( mr \"love\" and w \"desire\") and verbs describing emotional states ( rmi, \"weep\") among the categories of verbs that do not occur in statives. 98 The architectural features are sometimes interpreted as having some sexual connation relating to female anatomy. Cf. Vinson 2015. 99 Outside door can be seen as an archetypal setting of separation, in which the speakers act out frustrations and pain of love. There are a few examples in the corpus where the similar outside the door setting is featured (e.g., Fox nos.46 -47), and they hav e been referred to as paraclausithyron (lit. \"outside the closed door\") after the similar motif in the Greek and Roman lyrics and elegy. Fox 1985, 185 -186. 100 See infra. 224 boy's wishful thinking, you can also see that it actually cons titutes the core content of the boy's wished -for reality. Everything \u2014he mansion, door, sister, and even (or especially) her angry voice \u2014is already perfect as it is, and all that the boy wants is that he would be part of the world that he is only seeing fro m a distance. The particle l is of interest here. This is a later writing of seen earlier in the discussion of Khakheperreseneb .101 In addition to expressing a wish, the particle seems to have developed a nuance of lack by the Ramesside period . For instance, the negation of df l n, \"that he does not say 'if only, '\" is used idiomatically to express the state of contentment and happiness :102 to be in a state one has to say l n means you are in need; to be in a state one does not have to say l n at all means you are not in need, but in fullness and satisfaction. For this reason, in the satirical texts, the standard greeting wish formula such as nk wk snb k \"may you live, prosper, and by nn l nk, \"without 'if only' to you.\"103 In light of the connotation that l n has, the songs that use repetition of l n as a main constituting device readily convey the state of lack and the force of longing . The following cycle of song also makes use of the repetition of l n six times in a row.104 oCairo CG 25218 + oDeM 1266, 18 -28 (= no. 21) l n tys nsy nty m ry-rdwy s If only I were her Nubian, who (serves) as her attendant ... 101 Cf. hn in the Tale of Woe (see Chapter 4) ; GEG \u00a7238. In earlier Egyptian, (and a rarer variant w) is often followed by the enclitic particle for emphasis. In later Egyptian, the same article is written out syllabically in group writing as -n or -n-r. Hence, -n-r > nr > l. 102 For instance, in the Letter of Menna ( oChicago OIC k wt r xf bw dk l n m gr wk sr(.t) r pnn, \"I have satisfied your needs with everything, what people are trying to own. I used to not let you say 'if only I had' at night, as you lay there and tossed and turned.\" Similarly, in a eulogy to the city l n, \"happiness dwells within her (the city), there is no one says of himself, 'if only I had.'\" 103 E.g., pAnastasi l nk, \"may you live, be well, be healthy, my excellent brother, equipped permanently (?) without 'if only' to you.\" 104 Fox reconstructs another l n in the broken part and treats the subsequent lines as constituting the 7th stanza. Mathieu (1996, 111 n. 387) does n't see the ground for another l ni in the lacuna, and treats the subsequent lines as the continuation of the 6th stanza. 225 ...105 {sw}<st> n n nw n ts nbt l n p rtiw 106 n snt ... sky t m pys nfry f[d] s rs {m} im ... l n tm r nty m ry-bs ... l n dww n m ww ... p sbd n rrmt psfy ]... ... l n wts m [i] ry [] b n n r .d{s} tm [b] t [...] sw sw sm [bt] y b r st[f] ... she brings me the hue of all her whole body.

If only I had the \"morning of seeing\" like that which is made for her lifetime.107 Beautiful is the land of Isy, splendid are its produce. happy is her mirror... ...

If only she would come to see me, I shall make a festival to the god, he who causes her not to be far, may he grant me the mistress daily, without her absence from [me]. [...] If I spend a moment not seeing her, [...] my [heart] turns inside my body (?) [...] I'll worship him in the depths108 of the night, I will present offerings, my heart will descend to [its] place ... 105 The ellipsis without brackets represents the verses I have chosen not to cite out of the concern for length and relevance. The el lipsis with the brackets represents the lacunae. 106 The arm sign is followed by the sSr sign; it's not clear if the latter is serving as determinative or a word on its own. Translation here follows Fox and Mathieu. 107 Uncertain translation. Fox (1985, 38) reads \"if only I had a morning of seeing like one who spends her lifetime (?)!\" Mathieu translates (1996, 101), \"puiss\u00e9 -je avoir le matin pour [la] voir tout le temps de son existence.\" 108 Following Kitchen's (1996, 3 91) translation choice here. The root nfr means \"to be beautiful\" but also \"end\" or negative expression nfr n , \"not\"). GEG \u00a7351. 226 In the first two stanzas, l n is used to formulate the boy's desire to be the girl's personal maid, which he imagines would grant him an intimate and private access to the girl: a Nubian maid to adorn and see her naked body, and a laundryman to handle the clothes that touched her body. The next two stanzas move on to the realm of objects. The speaker wants to be a signet ring that is always on her finger and a mirror that she gazes upon every day. In the final two stanzas, the boy's longing is more directly expressed. He wishes that he had her and that she would come see him. It is worth noting that i n these two stanzas, the backdrop of the boy's fantasy shifts from the confines of the domestic setting to outdoor, to a pastoral and festival background.109 For instance, i n the fifth stanz a, references are made to bouquets made of all kinds of greeneries and flowers (including the lapis lazuli flowers that are thought to be of Nubian origin and the flowers of the Hittite land), which conjure up in mind not only the bucolic environment where the flowers grow, but also the cosmopolitan city during the time of the festivals when all the flowers are brought together for celebration. Fox mentions how the images developed at length in this poem tend to detach themselves from the reality of love and direct the attention away from the personalities of the lovers involved.110 I think this would have been particularly conducive to drawing in the audience and evoking the similar kind of longing in them. While the song is framed as one boy's longing for a girl, aesthetic and sensorial details that give shape to that longing \u2014from the intoxicating scent of mandrakes and delicate feel of the linen to the lushness of the wreaths and the excitement of the festivals -are those that any Egyptian would have found e xtremely pleasant and desirable. 109 A subtle shift can already be observed in in the fourth stanza, where the mention of the land of Isy and its produce evokes the exotic image of the foreign land. It is worth noting that the produce of the exotic foreign land and the mirror are associated with the goddess Hathor. In the final two stanzas, the Hathoric theme gets further developed, in assoc iation with the festival. On the prominence of Hathor or other types of \"returning goddess\" in the festivals that form the backdrop of the love songs, see Darnell 2016. 110 Fox 1985, 281 -282. 227 The sixth stanza is a continuation and culmination of the festival setting but with a different focus. This last stanza is different from the rest in that the speaker does not only express his desire, but also expresses hi s determination to take a specific action (or a series of actions) on his part if the desire is granted . While too many lacunae make it difficult to give a complete picture, references to a festival of a god ( b n n r), worship ( sw) and presentation of offerings (sm bt) point to the celebratory cultic setting. Hence, it seems to be the case that the speaker is intending to make his \"private\" longing for the girl gain a more public status by making it official before the god. Moving o n to another example, t he following song is made up of three stanzas, all of which begin with l n wk snt s.t, \"if only you would come to (your) sister swiftly.\" Each stanza features imagery of a figure that embodies the longed -for swiftness. Chester Beatty I 1, 1-2, 5 (= Fox no. 38 -40) l n wk n snt s.t m wpwty -nsw n s r r ... l mr -nf ... If only you would come to (your) sister swiftly, like a swift royal messenger ... all the stables are harnessed for him, horses are (harnessed) for him at rest stations, the chariot is harnessed in its place, ... If only you would come to (your) sister swiftly, like a royal horse, ... his master knows his strides, if he hears the sound of whip, he will not know any restraint ... If only you would come to (your) sister swiftly, like a gazelle bounding111 on the desert, ... its body weary, fear having entered its body, hunters are behind him, dogs next to him, ... 111 p is a variant of p, \"to bounce, bound.\" Fox 1985, 69. 228 The swiftness associated with the figures adds further intensity to the force of longing already conveyed by l n. By wishing that the lover would come to her at such super -speed, the speaker is expressing h ow much she wants to be with him: right now, as soon as possible. A certain progression (or break) is to be observed between the first two stanzas and the third.112 The figures used in the first two stanzas have a certain royal feel to it; there is a sense of strength, confidence and order surrounding the images of the royal messenger113 and of the royal horse of the New Kingdom empire.114 The royal messenger can travel fast with the help of the imperial infrastructure and logistics.115 The otherwise unstoppable royal horse is under the control of a capable master; he gallops when whipped. The gazelle in the third stanza is a little differen t. The gazelle is in the wilderness, the space that lies outside the world of orderliness controlled by the king. Not only is it fatigued, but ryt q.t m tf, \"fear has entered its body.\" This phrase is often used to describe the state of the enemies of the pharaoh.116 Its swiftness is born out of desperation; it runs, because it simply cannot afford to stop. A sense of precariousness and disorderliness permeates the imagery, which in turn hints at the quality of the speaker's longing, which is not pres ent in the first two stanzas. 117 Before moving on, it is worth taking a brief look at the following Ramesside love spell 112 Cf. Fox 1985, 68 describes it as \"rather grating.\" 113 The theme of the royal messenger is also known from the Ramesside Miscellanies. 114 On horses in ancient Egypt , refer to Hofmann 1989. 115 It is known that the Egyptian armies had an organized system of provision and supply depots. For instance, the Ways of Horus was dotted with stations at an interval of about 20km. Spalinger 2005, 33f., 241; E. Morris 2005 384f. 116 For instance, in the bat tle relief of Sety I's campaign against the Hittites speaks of the subdued enemies (from the text accompanying the relief of Hittite Chariots): ryt mf q.t m-msn df s.ns bsn, \"the terror of his majesty has entered in them, his aura has invaded their hearts.\" Karnak, Amun District, Hypostyle (Exterior)/North Wall, West Wing, Bottom Register. OIP 107, pl. 35, l. 30. The surrendering message sent by Tefnakht to Piye as recorded in the Victory stela of Piye reads (l.133): w kk ryk m ti snt m-b qs, \"As your ka -endures, terror of you is in my belly, fear of you is within my bones.\" 117 Cf. Fox (1985, 68) suggests that the imagery here expresses \"the wild and unrestraine d force of lust, suggesting the intensity of the sexual desire of the youth.\" 229 from Deir el -Medina . Just like in the love song immediately examined above, a series of similes whose images are drawn from the bucolic and domestic environment are employed, all headed by m: Ostracon Deir el -Medina w dt ytst m-s... Hail to you, Re -Horakhty, father of the gods... Come (make)119 X (f.) born of Y come after me, like a n ox after grass , like a maidservant after her children, like a herdsman after his her d. If they do not make her come after me... While the use of the similar phraseology conveys the similar sense of longing , as indicated by the absence of l n (among other things), the speaker is not simply expressing 5.3.2 Dynamics of Heart Given the Egyptian conception of the heart, it is not all that surprising to see the heart being featured extensively in the love songs.120 It is the heart that serves as the agent of longing and any action that derives from that longing. Consider the following example, which is short and sweet with a neat parallelism.121 Harris 500 5, 12 -6, 2 (= Fox no. 16) b (r) s (m) mrwt k gs n m nbd tw w.kw m s s r w k mky n ty n(t) My heart remembered your love, while (only) half my head was done, I have come in running to seek you, neglecting my hairdressing... The first half of each couplet serves as the main clause with pseudo -verbal predicate, which describes the speaker's thought or action in respect to her lover. The second half then describes 118 Published in Smither 1941. For a hieratic facsimilie and a hieroglyphics, refer to Posener 1938, pl 31 and 31a. transcription. 119 mm has been omitted by the scribe. Smither 1941, 131 n.c. 120 For the role of the heart in the love songs, Mathieu 1996, 165 -168; Toro Rueda 216 -217. 121 The stanza is made up of three couplets, but since the third couplet has a lacuna and the translation is uncertain, here I only discuss the first two. 230 the circumstances of the main clause, both involving the undone state of the speake r's hairdo. The second couplet represents a subtle development or the result of the first couplet: it is because/after the heart has thought of the love that the speaker has come seeking the lover in haste, so much so that her hair is still a mess. Her mov ement ( w) arises directly from her heart, and what we see here is an instance of \"following one's heart\" captured in its moment.122 Notice that although it is not directly expressed in the song, the speaker came in running (m ss) is suggestive of the kind of movement her heart makes at the thought of her lover: it, too, is very likely to be running. The theme of a racing heart is also seen in the fourth stanza of the first cycle of the song on Chester Beatty. Here the verb fd, \"move quickly,\"123 which puns on the word for four, is predicated of the heart, both at the very beginning and at the end. Just like in the previous example, it is the heart's remembering the lover (the word s, \"to remember\" recurs three times) which m akes the heart race. As a result, here too, the speaker is prevented from properly adorning herself. Unlike in the previous example, however, the speaker of this song tries to resist the heart's prompting. Chester Beatty I 2, 9 -10 (= Fox no. 34) wt m fdt Fourth Stanza fd sw b s/ r s mrwt k/ -----1 My heart hurries itself instantly, at the memory of your love. bw dd f m m rm/ sw tfy mkt f/ -----2 It does not let me walk like a (normal) person, it has strayed from its proper place bw dd f y mssy/ bw wn py bhn/ -----3 It does not let me don a tunic; I cannot put on my cloak, I cannot apply paint to my eyes, I cannot anoint myself at all. m-r p (r)-nw(f)/ rf n r-tnw s delay, reach (him) at his place,\" it says to me whenever I think of him, m-r n py ty w/ .rk n r / -----6 Don't make, my heart, folly to me, why do you act crazy? 122 The theme is well expressed in the the Antef Song as well as in the Doomed Prince , both of which are found in Papyrus 500. On the expression ms b, see Lorton 1968, 41 -64. 123 Wb. 1, 72.1 -2. See also the discussion on ws above in the discussion on Neferti . 231 w nk sn/ rt qnw m -mtt/ -----7 Sit, be cool, may the brother come to you, many others likewise. 124 m rd t d n rm r/ st th.tw m mrwt/ -----8 b mk fd/ -----9 Don't let people say about me, a girl who has gone astray by love. Stand firm whenever you think of him, My heart, do not flee. The first and the last couplets bracket the entire poem, themselves parallel to one another with a chiasmus ( fd-s-s-fd). The three couplets following the first couplet (2 -4) are made up of a series of negation, expressing the speaker's inability to function normally. The fifth couplet is of great interest. It marks the half point, and the phrase p nw in the first half of the fifth couplet can be interpreted not simply in relation to the content, but to the structure of the song: it has now reached ( p) the very innermost ( nw) part of the current stanza, and of the entire cycle (the cycle is made of seven stanzas in total). The word s in the second half of the same coup let also contributes to this \"half point marking\" in that it looks back to first s in the first couplet while looking forward to the third s in the last couplet. Most interestingly in the fifth couplet, the voice of the heart intrudes, as a direct q uotation cited by the speaker. Sudden shifts of voice or address are quite common across the corpus but often without explicit indicators. Here, the second half of the fifth couplet \u2014 rf n r tnw s sw \"it says to me whenever I think of him\" \u2014serves a s the explicit narrative statement to indicate that shift has taken place. Notice the changes in the referent of the 3ms pronouns. Until now, 3ms has been used to refer only to the heart. In this phrase, however, the boy who has until now been addressed in the second person, too, is referred by the 3ms pronoun, sw. It then makes us wonder: who is the speaker talking to at this point? Starting from the sixth couplet, the boy continues to be referred to with the 3ms pronoun, while it is now the heart that is directly 124 Following Mathieu's (1996, 40 n.6) interpretation who reads the seated man not as a suffix pronoun (what Fox does) but as a determinative and translated rt as \"person.\" 232 addressed with the 2ms pronoun. From the sixth couplet onwards, it also represents the resistance put up by the speaker against her own heart. The barrage of imperatives creates the experience of the rhythm that simulates the movement or sound of the racing heart. Alternatively, it can be thought of in terms of deep breath that one takes when trying to calm down the racing heart. Not knowing how it actually sounded, we can only speculate, but in any case, by the last couplet, the audience would hav e very much experienced they rhythm of the girl's heart laminated onto the rhythm of the song. The heart serving as the self's Other is something that occurs quite often in Egyptian literary texts. The interior back -and-forth between the self and the O ther gets an interesting twist in the following example, whose setting is typically understood as the \"morning after.\"125 The female speaker has had a great time the night before with her lover, but now that the morning has come she has to leave. Here, it is the voice of the swallow126 heralding the morning that serves as the female speaker's Other. Harris 500 5, 6-8 (= Fox No.14) rw t mnt r mdt sw r d The voice of the swallow speaks, it says: p t i wt{}<> \"The day has dawned, what your way?\" mk p pd wk r gm.n sn m tyf nkyt In his bedroom, have I found (my) brother, ty nm m w my heart being exceedingly joyful. dn nn w r wy We said (to each other), \"I will never be far,\" w rt m-d rt while holding hands (lit. hand with hand), rr127 swtwt w n{}<T>128 \"With you I make stroll 125 Fox 1985, 23, 288 -289. 126 The choice of a swallow may be thought in relation to B a. Allmansa -Viallatoro (2016, 1 -9) provides an interesting interpretation of the role of Ba in Man and Ba . Based on the observation that it was not uncommon in ancient Mediterranean world for animals being portrayed as capable of warning people of dangers (she mentions Achilles' horse in Illiad; we could also add to the list Baalam's donkey in Hebrew Bible), she notes that what Ba is trying to do in the text is to warn the Man of an imminent danger. Perhaps the swallow is trying to warn the girl of the immi nent danger ( b) as well. See also Migilio 2022 which discusses the significance of birdcalls and bird imagery in the Gilgame Epic. 127 Mathieu takes the r under the eye sign as a proposition and reads r rt swtwt , \"pour faire des promenades\" instead. 128 Writing of suffix pronouns is very confusing in this song. The seated man determinative is used throughout, where 1cs is not expected. Both Fox and Mathieu amend 1cs to either 2ms or 2fs, as a continuation of the direct speech. 233 m st nb nfrt in every pleasant m tpt n nfrwt He placed <me> as the best of the beautiful, bw f py ty he does not destroy my heart.129 The word yy here is taken as a variant of tt, \"to quarrel.\"130 As is the case with any verb formed by republication, repeated action is implied. Similar to the way the heart in the previous song makes the speaker feel uncomfortable by its repeated thumping, the swal low is making the speaker of the current song uncomfortable by its yy-ing. Like the previous speaker, the current speaker scolds and fights against the opposing voice. The verses starting from gm.n i can be understood as the girl's self -justification for not doing what the voice tells her to do. That is, why she is choosing to linger. Quoted are the words of the promise exchanged between her and the lover the night before. Appa rently, they had decided they would never be far from each other and live happi ly ever after. \"He does not destroy my heart,\" the girl insists. The use of the word in this last verse is interesting.131 It looks back to earlier in the song (same glyphs but with a different determinative), while anticipating the outcome of the eve nt, which unfolds in another song that immediately follows the current song in the manuscript.132 Harris 500 5, 9-12 (= Fox no.15) .di r r p rdwy m q r prt r d ni f w I turn my face to the door outside look, (my) brother is coming to me! My eyes are on the road, my ears listening... ... my heart cannot be silent. He/It sent me a messenger, swift of feet in coming and going, to tell me he wronged me. 129 bw smf as aorist negative. Alternative ly, bw smf could be seen as negation of preterite. Junge 2012, 100 -101. 130 According to the commentary to this verse in TLA, the transitive use of tt is rare, but still attested elsewhere (e.g., oGardiner 54 rto. 5; pVandier 2.7). It is also suggested that the spelling yy can possibly be seen as a play on words with , \"to be happy,\" which is once said of birds in Edfu. 131 One could probably render as \"break\" or \"wound.\" I chose \"destroy\" to foreground the \"gravity\" of situation here. The same word for the destruction of the land for which Neferti mourns is being used. For the girl, the situation is that serious. 132 Fox suggests that Harris 500 5, 12 -6, 2 (= Fox no. 16) cited at the beginning of this subsection also belongs to the same cycle. 234 k d gm f ktt In other words, he found another, sw r gg n r{f} rf p b n ky r ppw (while) he was gazing into my face.133 What is (wrong) with him, the heart -destroyer and player.134 The girl is waiting for the lover, and her heart is racing ( bw gr b). In Chapter 3, we saw that the movement of heart is taken as the \"speech\" of heart, as by its sound the physician learns what's going on deep inside the patient's body. There, it was noted that because the various speech verbs can be predicated of both the heart and the patient, sometimes i t is ambiguous whether the personal pronouns on the speech verbs refer to the heart or the patient. Something similar happens in the following exam ple. Somebody has sent the girl the messenger, the messenger who is swift of foot, etc. On one hand, one could understand it is the lover who has sent the girl the 133 Fox (1985, 24) translates, \"she is gazing at his face\" without any comment on the pronouns involved. Mathieu (1996, 77 n. 240) translates, \"elle est en admiration devant lui\" also without any comment on the pronouns. Both translations seem to understand t he subject of this clause as referring to a hypothetical girl designated by ktt in the immediately preceding clause. But the pronoun is 3ms sw. Moreover, Mathieu's hieroglyphic transcription (1996, pl. 12, 11) has sw r gg n r followed by the seated man determinative and f. Mathieu has then placed sic. below the seated man determinative, which explains his decision to translate the phrase \"devant lui \" instead of \"devant moi, \" but it still does not explain why he has translated sw as \"elle.\" Here, I am t aking sw as referring to the boy and taking the seated man determinative after r seriously as the 1cs suffix pronoun while f at the end as a scribal mistake. Differently put, both Fox and Mathieu's translations reflect an understanding that the boy has f ound another girl and moved on from the speaker. My translation suggests that the boy is two -timing. 134 Lit. one who injures the heart of another and he who wanders. My translation here is quite liberal, but (I think) plausible. For taking p ... as the participle referring to the boy, this sounds more natural and intelligible in light of something similar in the funerary laments cited above, where the construction is used to the person gone. Previous translations all point out the obscurity of t he meaning of ppw and offer tentative translations. For instance, Fox (1985, 24) gives \"(Well), what is it (to me) that another's nasty heart makes me into a stranger(?) ?\"; Mathieu (1996, 63 and 77 n. 240) gives \"eh quoi! etre offense par une autre, et un e etrangere!\" The root pp with meaning \"strange\" (in the sense of innovative or extraordinary) occurs in Khakheperreseneb in rto. 2 cited above with the book scroll determinative (Y1). It also occurs in the Tale of Woe (pPushkin 127 3, 7) with eye determ inative (D6), which Caminos (1977, 77) translates as an \"enemy.\" In the current text, the word is followed by finger (D51), arm holding stick (D40) and seated man (A1) determinatives. The combination of D51 and D40 is used for verbs like , \"measure\" ( see Chapter 3 for discussion) or , \"seize.\" Here, I am taking it as an imperfective participle of p, \"to wander, encounter (someone)\" ( Wb. III, 258.3 -16; see the Neferti passage cited above), somebody who habitually wanders and/or meets someone new (with a connotation of seizing the heart?). 235 messenger. In this case, what is narrated afterwards is happening for real , not just in imag ination . On the other hand, as the closest antecedent for f is the heart, we can understand the whole thing to be describing the dynamics of the heart, one anxious thought leading to another.135 The sudden changes of address aptly convey how quickly her th oughts are snowballing. On either reading, one thing appears obvious. In the previous song, the girl was very confident that he would not destroy her heart. By the end of this song, the guy has turned into a total heartbreaker ( even if she is only imaginin g it).136 5.3.3 Lovesickness Painful paradox of longing comes into full view in the songs that feature lovesickness.137 Intense longing has plunged the lovers into the state of depression and illness, yet they cannot stop longing, because the only way they can get out of the current state is by being united with the one for whom they long. In these songs, the opposition b etween the current state of lack/separation and the imagined state of fulfillment/union is still the main constituting device, but it becomes intertwined with yet another set(s) of dichotom(ies), sickness/death and health/life. No explicit reference to lo vesickness is made in the following song, but one of its most characteristic symptoms, loss of appetite, is at play. The female speaker complains that away from her lover, what is supposed to taste sweet and pleasant tastes bad. She declares only her lover's kiss of nose can revivify her: Harris 500 5, 1-3 (=Fox no.12) 135 Messengers ( wpwty w) can also refer to disease causing agents. See the discussion below on lovesickness. 136 Antef Song , which start s from 6, 2 of the same papyrus has lines that read (6, 11 -12): ms bk n nfrwk r wtk tp tm w bk, \"follow your heart and your beauty/pleasure, carry out earthly concerns when/as your heart commands.\" Interestingly, the parallel verse from the Harper's song from the tomb of Paatenemheb has m bk commonly translated as \"do not let your heart be br oken,\" instead of m w bk. This probably has to do with the fact that the mace (T3) and the w cord (V25) look the same in hieratic. 137 Cf. Hermann 1959, 98 -100; Fox 1985, 279ff; Mathieu 1996, m s.wy pdw nmt fnd k w.ty t nty r sn b gm.n j d tw n mn r (n) n t I came [...because of your] love, the steadfast one within me (?)138 When I behold sweet cakes, it is like beholding salt. Pomegranate wine, sweet in my mouth, it is like the gall of birds. The kiss139 of your nose alone is what revives my heart I have found that Amun gave you to me for ever and ever. In traditional Egyptian thought, giving of life through the nose is something associated with a deity or a king, though not necessarily involving an act of kissing. Canonically, gods first give the breath of life to the king, then the king \"distributes\" th at breath of life to the people. References are too many to enumerate, but one is immediately reminded of the enduring motif in royal iconography of the gods holding the ankh sign close up to the nose of the king. One can also easily recall the foreign vas sals constantly begging pharaohs for the breath of life. On this note, that the languishing speaker is identifying her lover's kiss as the only source capable of resuscitating her seems to grant to the lover a power and status that is unusual for mere mort als. One is quite naturally reminded of the romantic conception of \"true love's kiss.\" This is not without good reasons. Granted, it is a trope popularized by Disney, but Disney movies are (or used to be) after all adaptations of traditional fairytales, and just around the time the love songs were being written down, the fairytale -like narratives were being put down to writing for the first time as well. In fact, on the verso of the same papyrus on which the current song is found is also found the story o f the Doomed Prince which employs many familiar motifs known from later European fairytales. An Egyptian prince ends up in the foreign land of Naharin (=Mitanni) in the 138 Most translators have taken as a verbal predicate, either a present tense (e.g., Fox 1985, 21: \"my heart stands still within me\"; Tobin 2003, 313: \"my heart stops within me\") or an optative (e.g., 1996, 74: se moi!\" or \"tiens -toi en moi, mon coeur!\"; cf. Kitchen 1999, 356). 139 Mathieu (1996, 75) has nmw , \"scent\" or \"odor,\" wh ich is masculine. This does not explain the stative ending -ti on w or the feminine demonstrative t. 237 course of his journey disguised as a fugitive. There, he rescues the princess who has b een locked up in a tower by jumping seventy feet above ground to the window of the princess' room. This dramatic rescue is followed by the kiss. Not only that, when the princess learns that her own father is trying to have the prince killed, she adamantly cries out: \"if he is taken from me, I shall neither eat nor drink but shall die right away.\"140 Love can indeed be as strong as death. Not uncommonly, words like mr and yt are used to refer to lovesickness.141 In the following song from Harris 500, the sp eaker plans to feign sickness ( mr n ) so as to lure the girl of his desire to pay him a visit with other neighbors. The way the boy speaker conjures up an imagined scenario in which he enjoys a trivial interaction with the girl he likes is reminiscent of the very first song cited above, where the boy fantasizes about being scolded by the girl.142 Though the boy is only pretending to be sick, he still refers to his condition as pyi mr, \"my illness,\" which no physician 500 2, 9-11 (=Fox no.6) w r sr n nw k mr n k q ny{r}<> swt r ptr( ) k wt t snt m -sn ws r r n n swnw r b l r ws r.t py mr I will lie down inside (at home), and then be ill in pretense.143 Then my neighbors will come to see (me), and then (my) sister will come with them. She'll put the doctors to shame, for (only) she understands my illness. The boy's dreamed up reality unfolds sequentially over 5 clauses. The w + r clauses in the beginning and the end form a mini inclusio to the three k clauses in the middle. The r + circumstantial clause of the last verset is not part of the sequenced actions. It is an explanation to 140 LES 5, 11 -12. On a similar note, it is also interesting that the current song is immediately followed by the song where the female speaker (presumably the same speaker) says in her prayers: \"[Give me] my prince tonight, or I am like on who (lies) in her grave! For are y ou not health and life?\" 141 For the meaning and use of these words, refer to Chapter 2. 142 Harris 500 5, 12 -6, 2 (= Fox no. 16). 143 The phraseology of sr n nw followed by mr n is reminiscent of Anubis' wife in the Two Brothers discussed in the previous chapter. 238 the immediately precedin g w clause, at the same time figuring as the punchline of the entire song.144 The theme of lovesickness is most fully developed in the seventh stanza of the first cycle of song in the Chester Beatty papyrus. We already saw another stanza from the same cy cle, and since this final stanza is the culmination of all the previous stanzas, it may be worth giving a brief synopsis of the entire cycle so as to provide the context.145 The cycle presents a single event happening over an unspecified period of time from two different points of view by two characters. From the first moment they exchange glances, they become infatuated with each other, but obstacles prevent them from realiz ing the love. While the speakers' voices alternate between the stanzas, stanzas are not presented as dialogues (i.e. , the boy and the girl are not talking to each other), but as individual monologues. The first stanza is the boy's ode to the girl: she who is long of neck, white of breast, whose hair is lapis lazuli, fingers like lotuses, etc. has captured his heart.146 The second stanza is the girl's description of her feelings for him. His voice vexes her heart, even to the point of making her feeling sick. In stanza three , the boy narrates that happens to him on the day he sets out to go see the girl. He runs into \"Mehy in his chariot together with his lovers.\" Mehy is an enigmatic figure that appears in a few other love songs as well, and some debates exis t as to who or what Mehy is.147 In the current song's context, it is clear that Mehy is somebody that thwarts the boy's initial plan to go see the girl, instead of helping him. Stanza four returns to the girl's point of view, which was already discussed abo ve. In stanzas five and six, the boy and the girl continue to long for each other. Both invoke the 144 Cf. Mathieu 1996, 187 thinks that the song contains a series of inversions of the traditional topos. 145 See Fox 1985, 61 -64 for more detailed summary of the plot running through the cycle. 146 The so -called w asf-form, a structural device shared in love poetry in the Mediterranean. It occurs in Egyptian mortuary literature. 147 For instance, Fox thinks he's a Cupid -figure who embodies the power of love. Fox 1985, 64 -66. Mathieu 155 - 156. The summary of other interpretation s can be found in Gillam 2000, 207 -216. 239 Golden One (Hathor) for help. Then comes the last stanza of the cycle. Not having been able to see the girl for days, the boy is wasting away: Chester Beatty I 4, 6-5, 2 wt sfnwt Seventh bw hr b prtsn/ -----3 Seven to yesterday that I haven't seen sister, and sickness has entered deep into me, I have grown heavy in my limbs, my body has lost sense of itself.

May she open her eyes, that my body rejuvenate, Her speech, then I will be strong. When I embrace her, she exorcises harm from me. She left me now seven days. The same themes, such as physicians being not able to provide a cure or that only the lover's presence can revive the heart of the speaker can be seen, but they are interwoven into extended interlocking patterns of parallelism. Interestingly, medicine and magic, two complementary aspects of the Egyptian art of healing , figure as one of the structuring devices of the text. In the third and fourth couplets , the physician ( swnw ) and lector priests are introduce d as a word pair. 148 Messengers here could be an allusion to Sakhmet's messengers. They are frequently mentioned along with the slaughtering demons ( tyw). Sakhmet's messengers were believed to bring diseases or cause harms. E.g., Ed win Smith 19, 18 -20, 1. The girl's messengers in the song, in contrast, bring life. On Sakhmet's messengers, see among others, Germond 1981, 298 -304; Ritner and Scalf here as salut , indicating general \"well -being,\" on the basis of the presence of the words sn and snb, which, together with w form a conventional word pair. In my view, \"amulet\" makes a better sense because 1) the word is written with the w-eye determinative and 2) this couplet, together with the one immediately preceding it parallel the 3rd and 4th couplets. 240 The seventh and eighth couplets then mirror and expand on the third and fourth couplets without exactly reintroducing the pair. More specifically, i n the seventh, the word prt, \"remedies\" is repeated from the third couplet, but dmdyt , the \"scroll\" where the remedies are recorded is ne wly introduced. Both prt and dmdyt are the emblems of chief physicians ( wr swnw ),150 and the phonetics of the second verset of the seven th couplet , wr sw n , seems to mimic wr swnw . The eighth couplet similarly expands on the healing art associated with the lector priests. The word w here is written with the eye of Horus, indicating that the intended word here is the healing amulet. In sound, it is a play on the word w in the fo urth couplet. The fifth and sixth couplets which form the core (middle) of the songs are parallel to one another in that they start with p + infinitive and the repetition of p nty sn, \"that which revives.\" The first and last couplets form an inclusio . In addition to the obvious repetition of the word sf, seven, the illness that has entered him as a result of being away from her, which is the content of the first couplet, is conceptually the opposite of the evil being exorcised by her presence. 5.4 Conclusion This chapter has examined the poetics of pain in the literary laments and the love songs. Undoubtedly the two genres are very different. As their genre labels readily reveal, the laments are about grief, and the love songs are about love. Not only that, the literary laments are associated with the seriousness of the Middle Kingdom literature; being mainly concerned with man's ethical life, they are \"generally unromantic in all senses of the word.\"151 In contrast, the Ramesside love songs are con cerned with the pleasant and beautiful life; they are light, almost frivolous; the ethical life does not appear to be the primary concern. 150 Refer to the Ebers spell in Chapter 3. 151 Parkinson notes 1997a, 9. 241 Yet, as I hope to have demonstrated in this chapter, aestheticization of pain in these works share something in com mon. In both cases, the speakers suffer on account of what is missing ( maat , the lover), and they long for what is missing. In both, this reality of pain is given its shape by the oscillating movement between two poles. The movements of then -now of the laments and separation -union of the love songs dramatize a sense of lack or rupture. Scholars have viewed the function of these two genres in terms of entertainment.152 For the literary laments, entertainment is explained by the cathartic pleasures,153 while t he love songs have been linked to a sense of oblivion.154 These are valid accounts. Based on the analysis and interpretations offered in this chapter, I would like to venture to offer something more nuanced. I would like to bring to the fore the sense of lo nging, which is also a form of pain. I suggest that these texts, by virtue of their beauty, also create in the audience similar kind of longing and encourage to explore deeper into their longing. In this view, entertainment has to do with \"cultivating\" lon ging: people learn to long beautifully. 152 See below in the Excursus B. 153 Parkinson (1997a, 15): \" descriptions of agony were intended to be a source of aesthetic pleasure, presumably in a manner similar to the sufferings enacted in western tragedy.\" In reference to Neferti , Parkinson also notes (1997a, 133): \"it is notable that a king could consider such a searing and dark lament as 'entertainment' and the poet's art has a central role in this; it makes the 'undone' chaos into something 'perfect', and the imperfection of life and history becomes a source of aesthetic pleasure.\" Also in: Parkinson 1999, 76 -8; Parkinson 2000, 46-9. Enmarch (2008, 63) speaks of how the Egyptians derived \"a certain cathartic pleasure in the artistic formulation of untoward thought.\" Cf. Polus -Wegner 2021, 93. 154 sm- b; See below in Excursus B. 242 Excursus B: Pain and Entertainment Both literary laments and love songs have been understood in terms of entertainment. Here, I turn to two phrases that are associated with the laments and the love songs sy-r155 and sm-ib. Based on the meaning and usage of these phrases, I suggest that in contrast to the modern notion of entertainment, where much focus is placed on the subject (i.e., people who undergo entertainment or who are entertained), the Egyptian notion of entertainment is much more object -oriented.156 Earlier it was mentioned that Neferti in the frame narrative is summoned by the pharaoh with the expectation that he would he would deliver beautiful speech for \"entertainment.\" Neferti 13 -14 d.n mf n-w-snb m m n nhw mdt sw nf rt nfrty His majesty l .p.h said \"Come Neferti, my friend, tell me some fine words, choice phrases that my majesty be entertained at hearing them.\" ... He stretched out his hand to the writing tools box . He took out for himself a papyrus roll and palette. Then he wrote down what the lector Neferti said ... While customarily translated and understood as entertainment, etymologically, a notion of pleasure is not inherent in the term. Rather, it suggests an idea of movement of the head, to turn the face away from the body.157 As such, in his study on Neferti , Goedicke argues against the 155 Wb. IV, 378 -379.8; FCD 258. 156 Differently put, entertainment is not primarily about what the subjects happen to find fun and beautiful; it is about the objects that possess extraordinary qualities that seize your attention or take your breath away. 157 Nyord 2009, 164 n. 1240. 243 traditional understanding of the expression as \"entertainment\" and instead suggests an interpretation closer to the literal meaning of the phrase, in the sense of \"to influence\" or \"to form an opinion or outlook.\"158 More recently, Volokhine has published a detailed study of the phrase.159 After examining various contexts in which the phrase occurs (harpooning, hunting, fishing, archery, educati onal walk, game of senet, etc.), he suggests that the common denominator among these is an activity of the gaze, esp ecially during moments of sustained attention. He concludes that the meaning of the phrase indeed extends to entertainment, but the kind of entertainment that requires concentration, not diversion. The phrase sm-b is customarily translated as entert ainment as well.160 The love songs often bear the title, st sm-b, \"songs of entertainment.\" 161 The etymology is uncertain. Some scholars have suggested \"to make the heart forget,\" using the morphological affinity to the word sm, \"to forget.\"162 Others scholars have translated it as \"having fun\", \"cheering up the heart\" mainly based on the context of use.163 Fox and Assmann suggest that the term can be used to denote \"entertainment literature .\"164 For Guilemi, however, \"entertainment\" is not the most appropriate , because literature with more serious tone also bears the similar title.165 He therefore suggests to understand the term as designating the thematized phenomena of the \"counter - world.\" The banquet context in which love songs would have been performed can be found in the 158 1977, 59f. 159 Volokhine 2016, 837 -859. 160 Wb. IV, 252,10 -253,4. 161 In addition to less frequently used sw nm, \"sweet verses\" referred to in the introduction of this chapter. Further discussion on the titles, Mathieu 1996, 134 -138. 162 Wb.

A song written on an ostracon from Deir el -Medina refers to singers performing on the occasion of hrw nfr , \"holiday (lit. beautiful day),\"166 equipped with instruments and words of sm-b.167 Love songs' relationship with the so -called Harpers' songs also helps understand the performative context.168 Harper's songs are poetic texts found in tomb murals, as a part of the tomb decoration that portrays the deceased's activities on earth.169 Near the banquet table before which the deceased is seated, a bald (and often blind) harper is shown performing for the occasion. The text of Harper's song is presented like a caption near the harper, like the lyrics to the music the harper is playing. Throughout the texts, the phrase sm-b occurs frequently, as well as references to standard paraphernalia of wine, music, flowers, and myrrh that recur in the love songs.170 The phrase goes back to the Old Kingdom, when it was associated with the activities of dancing and singing, especially in the context of the court entertainment. During the Old Kingdom, the overseers of palace singers and dancers would bear the epithet sm b n 166 According to Darnell (2016, 46), hrw nfr originally had application to funerary banquets, but by the Middle Kingdom, they came to be applied to Hathoric celebrations as well. For further references on the topic, see Darnell, Klotz and Manessa 2013, 1 n.2. Non-funerary contexts from New Kingdom and onwards are discussed in Gregersen 2015, 55 -85. nqt / syw pr m aw / w r.wsn pr m sm-ib... , \" My seeing you is a beautiful day / brother, seeing you is a great blessing / flood me with beer / (with) the singers equipped with instruments / their mouths equipped with sm b ...\" 168 Lichtheim 1945, 178 -212; Wente 1962, 118 -128. The standard debate be tween whether the banquet is mortuary/religious (depicting the reality of the deceased's existence in the hereafter) or biographical/secular (depicting an event in the deceased's past life). The tomb context has led the schoalrs to think harper's songs are rooted in the burial celebration and represent the literary transformation of actual performances that presumably occurred during these events in real life; Bochi 1998: 89 -95; Davies (51 -53) draws attention to the fact that the feasting scenes occur more than once in different parts of one tomb, and the kind with harper song doesn't have the same kind of ritual/magical force as the regular meal of the dead. 169 Or activities that are hoped for the afterlife. Interpretations vary. 170 E.g., TT 75: \"Sitting down to divert the heart ( sm b) according to the practice of existence on earth, anointed with myrrh, adorned with garlands, making holiday ( rt hrw nfr ) in his house of justification which he made for himself on the west of Thebes.\" Davies 1923, p ls. IV, V, XVIII. Also occurs in Amenhotep II 's Memphis stela (=Urk IV, 1307 ). 245 (king).\"171 Some dwarves bear the similar titles,172 and the divine dance that the pygmies perform, which is mentioned in the Pyramid Text (PT 517) and the autobiography of Harkhuf, is also modified by the phrase sm b n (king/god).173 During the New Kingdom, the phrase occurs most frequently in the context of banquets and leisure walk. It also occurs in the context of seeing beautiful things. In the tomb of Paheri at el -Kab, a caption to the deceased and his seated wife reads sm-ib m bw nfr , \"rejoicing at seeing beautiful things.\"174 It occurs in a royal, more official context as in Seti's stela at Abydos, where it refers to the temple he himself dedicated to Ramses I as the object of his sm-b.175 Interestingly, sy-r and sm-b frequently occur together. For instance, a caption in a Theban tomb to the scene where the deceased is overseeing a harvest reads apr m t nbt nfrt r sy-r n nb twy sm-b n n r nfr, \"equipping with all good things to entertain the lord of the two lands, to please the good god.\"176 In the tomb of Rekhmire, a caption reads, sm-b m 171 For instance, a late 5th dynasty Giza tomb of Nimaatre, bears the title my-r st pr- sm-b n nb f m st nfrt m nw pr -, \"overseer of singers of the palace who delights the heart of his lord with beautiful songs inside the palace\" (Jones, no. 3590; Strudwick 255). Within the same tomb, there's a chapel dedicated to his mother, Neferesere, who bears the title krt-nswt mrt Pr-n-n has the epithet sm-b nbf r-nb. In general, dwarves had a strong presence in the entertainment industry during the OK as there were dwarf harpists, dwarf animal (monkeys and dogs) tenders, etc. 173 The particular spell occurs in the pyramids of Pepi I, Merenre and Peipi II : dg pw b()w nr sm-b n r m b wy st f wrt, \"he is a dwarf of the god dances who cheers the god in front of his great throne.\" Rhe royal letter embedded in Harkhuf's autobiography m n t, \"Take off (quickly), because you are to bring this dwarf back with you, whom you are brining from the land of the horizon while he is alive, whole and healthy, for the dances to ch eer up and please the heart of the king Neferka -Re, who lives forever.\" 174 Urk IV, 126, 13; Griffith 1894, pl. iv. 175 btf pw s m nf s b, \"It is his wonder (=temple), what my heart rejoices in.\" K RI I, 110 -114; Cf. Assmann 2005 [2001], 49 discusses the passage in the context of filial piety. Also interesting is the example from OI Epigraphic Survey 1998, 49, Pl. 196: sm-b pw n ps t Imn m -nw.s (n) r yt, \"It is with pleasure of the ennead, within which Amun appears in glory (to) the rekhyt people.\" 176 TT 92; Urk n s y-r m kt st, \"being pleased at seeing the beautiful things, entertained by the works of field.\"177 Another example comes from a satirical letter: pAnastasi 3 sm-b/ I want to write (or: have written) a bundle of letters for you as a pleasure, so that you be glad when you hear it like an amusement. The pairing of the two phrases seems to reflect the Egyptian penchant for balance. Volokhine suggests that the pairing could be indicative of two complementary aspects of relaxation ( sy-Hr referring to attention and sm-b adding the nuance of forgetting) as envisioned by the ancient Egyptians for pleasurable pursuits.178 The phrase sy-r is also f ound in a graffito .179 Thou gh not using the phraseology, an illuminating example of a paring of Hr and ib occurs among the visitors' graffiti in the royal tomb: M.1.5.p.18.2 wt pw r.n imn-m-[ s s m t wt nr nt m n ti s-r bf r wr sy m rf m t pt sp There came the scribe Amenemhat, [son of Scribe Anat]menti to see the temple of the Majesty of the KULE, Sahure, justified. What he found was that it was exceedingly beautiful in his heart, it was to his eyes (lit. face) like the heaven, 180 Here, the expression nfr r bf is reminiscent of the Pharaoh's response to the peasant's speec h; a \"vision\" of heaven is reminiscent of a scene in Setna, where Neferkaptah enchants all kinds of by citing spells from the book he had found in x. In the same text, the expression \"didn't know 177 A 18th Dynasty Theban tomb, the deceased Senefer is shown seated with his wife and the accompanying caption reads, sy-r n Mryt in TT93 (Kenamun), Urk 1396. 178 Volokhine 859. 179 Navratilova 2015 . 180 Navratilova 2015 . 247 where on earth he was\" occurs twice. When Neferkaptah first hears from the old priest of the existence of the scroll, and when Setna, in possession of now dead Ne ferkaptah's scroll, first sees beautiful Tabououe. There, the expression conveys some sort of \"forgetting,\" but the focus is not really on the literal meaning of not knowing their whereabouts on earth, but on the marvelous nature of the object. Perhaps the English idiom \"to take one's breath away\" carries the similar connotation. For the Egyptians, entertainment seems to involve coming into contact with something breathtakingly beautiful; something other -worldly (not counter -world or carnivelsque as suggest ed by some), in the sense of sublime and elevated. As such, I think the key lies in not what people feel, but the nature of the obj ect/activity involved. Sure, it i s the subject, the person, whose breath is being taken (whose face sy, whose heart sm, etc.,), but the primacy is on the qualities of the object. Some scholars in the past have interpreted sm-b in terms of an escapist pursuit. 248 CHAPTER 6 Conclusion This study has examined the ways in which pain is framed and given meaning in ancient Egyptian texts dating from the Middle Kingdom up to the Third Intermediate Period. Overall, Egyptian understanding of pain emerging from these texts does not align with what people today would commonly think of pain. Egyptian notion of pain is expansive, encompassing the notions of illness, anguish, suffering and evil among others. In this concluding chapter, I provide a summary of the various strands of arguments and findings from the previous chapters. 6.1 summarizes the the oretical -methodologi cal argument of this study; 6.2 recapitulate s the substantive argument. Finally, 6. 3 discusses the limitations and the avenues for future research. 6.1 Pain and Egyptian Texts One of the chief objectives of this dissertation has been a theoretical -methodological one, to develop a heuristic framework that uses pain as an interpretative lens through which to read the ancient Egyptian texts. Towards this goal, Chapter 1 began by asking how something as subjective and experiential as pain could be studied in the Egyptian texts. It is a common practice to start by offering a definition (or working definition) of a concept with which one is working. I started, however, by arguing why it is neither sound nor necessary to start with a defin ition of pain for studying pain. No one definition seemed adequate for capturing the manifold meanings of pain. Instead of drawing attention to what pain consists of, I therefore drew attention to the grounds or conditions that make possi ble representation and communication of pain, and what purpose representation of pain serves. 249 Scarry's work is a standard text of reference for critically approaching pain. Her thesis that pain is utterly private and unsharable \u2014that it resists linguistic r epresentation \u2014has been widely influential, and at the same time received many criticisms in subsequent cultural histories of pain. For the purpose of this dissertation, the question of pain's shareability has been somewhat immaterial, as its point of depar ture inevitably had to be what has already been linguistically represented. More important for this project, therefore, was the question of what this already represented pain can tell us. Both Scarry and her critics agree that pain, however symbolic and fi gurative, does get represented in broader cultural discourses where its meanings are guided by the social and moral values of a culture. Particularly instructive for my purposes has been the idea that pain's articulation is intimately related to shared und erstandings of personhood (i.e., what man is , what man ought to be , what is man's place in the world, etc. ) and substantive communal values. Domains such as philosophy, spirituality, art and literature are known to have provided avenues for exploring and t ransmitting the meanings of pain in ways medicine does not: instead of eradicating pain, they educate and inspire people to transcend pain by tapping into the human desire for happiness and ability to seek \"higher meanings.\" To read the texts through the l ens of pain, therefore, is not just to look at the representations of pain in the texts, but to interpret pain in light of various factors, among which are what the culture deems good, beautiful and important. In this sense, pain has served not simply the object of study, but also a p oint of view from which to explore the Egyptian values. As much as this dissertation sought to employ the lens of pain in reading of the Egyptian texts, this dissertation has also sought to use the Egyptian texts to read pain. This was done by fleshing out the rich contextual understanding of the cultural dynam ics that underpin the meanings of pain. The corpus examined in this study consist ed of several different types/genres 250 of Egyptian texts, both literary and non -literary, which vary in aims, convention s and expectations. My reading of these texts took the \"generic\" differences not simply as a means to classify texts or speculate about texts' socio -functional context, but as indicative, if not constitutive, of the meanings of pain . Hence, while the analyses carried out in different chapters shared in common th e wide -rangi ng theoretical, methodological orientation, they differed in terms of the specific focus that was given.1 For Chapter 3, which examined the magico -medical texts, it was the language use of the Egyptian physician (or other types of healers) wh o has to treat pain that served as the focus of contextualization. The language of the magico -medical texts frame pain as an object of empirical observation as well as an object of performative action, without much commitment to giving an account of how pa in would be felt and experienced by those who are undergoing pain. This chapter also sketched out the distinct orientation of Egyptian medicine as a further step in contextualization, in view of the fact that medical understanding of pain is powerfully mediated by the epistemological and institutional contexts within which medicine operates. In Chapter 4 , which examined the literary narratives, the focus of analysis was laid on the ways in which pain is integ rated into the plot . Here, it was revealed that the Egyptian literary narratives utilize pain in order to foreground the interpersonal relationships between the characters and to elicit audience empathy. In Chapter 5, which examined the non -narrative lite rary compositions, the lite rary laments and the love songs, the analysis centered on how the formal aesthetics of the texts serve as the vehicle of the speaker's emotions. Although the emotions underlying the laments and the love songs are ostensibly very different \u2014grief and love \u2014both genres make use of antithetical 1 Put differently, by and large, I remained true to the general maxim of letting the ancient texts speak for themselves. 251 parallelism to convey the gap between the current state of lack and the desired state of fullness. Building upon this analysis, the chapter suggested that p ain can be understood in terms of this gap, as a form of longing that is concretized in the oscillating movement between the two opposing poles. 6.2 Pain in Egyptian Thought 6.2.1 Pain and Maat If we consider various pain situations across the different types of Egyptian texts examined in th is dissertation, we see that pain is intimately connected to the reality and experience of evil, as defined by the ancient Egyptians as the absence or disruption of order , maat . This was already made apparent in the lexicographical survey in Chapter 2, wh ich showed that not only are Egyptian pain words predominantly determined by the evil bird, but some of these words such as mr and mn in certain contexts are better translated as \"evil.\" Also noteworthy was the fact that words such as mr and mn occasionally take the Seth determinative. Seth is quintessential embodiment of disorder and violence, and pain's association with Seth is suggestive of the cosmological dimension of pain in Egyptian thought. In the magico -medical texts examined in Chapter 3, pain's association with evil became apparent in the ways in which various illness and pathological conditions are characterized in terms of a disturbance or irregularity in the workings of the bo dy, and their treatment in terms of contending with a dangerous force. Put differently, in the magico -medical texts, pain is evil in the sense that 1) it is a formal manifestation of the body's failure to operate according to its proper order, and/or 2) i t is caused by entities or forces that are evil (e.g., migraine as an attack by a demon). These two senses do not seem clearly distinguished from another in Egyptian 252 medical thought, and it is interesting to note that t here is a great parallel between the ways in which pain is counteracted in the medical sphere and the ways in which other \"evil\" forces are counteracted in the other pharaonic activities, such as execration rituals and military expeditions against the foreigners. Middle Egyptian literary c ompositions such as the Peasant and the literary laments mostly explicitly link the reality of pain with evil at the societal (and sometimes cosmological) level. From moral depravity and negligence of traditions to the incursion of foreigners and failure o f the Nile, various conditions that inflict pain upon the Egyptian society are seen as the manifestations of absence of maat or prevalence of isfet. In my analysis, I showed how these texts not only represent a speaker who is pained by and mourns at the pr evalence of evil but also induce the audience to participate in the similar experience. The love songs represent an interesting case. The speakers of the love songs, too, describe their experience in terms of evil. For instance, t he lovers' distress and a nguish are likened to a disease or an evil condition ( mr or yt) that the physicians' prescriptions cannot cure or the lector priests cannot exorcise. What the love songs are intent on drawing attention to , however, is not the experience of pain-evil itself, but the desirability of the full presence of or union with the loved ones . Egyptologists have certainly spoken on the topic of maat before. Past discussions on maat have often been projected from the standpoints of ideology, power, religion, etc. As pain is inflected with a personal and affective dimension, thinking about maat from the perspective of pain allows to view maat in personal and affective terms. This, in turn, allows for a more nuanced and dynamic assessment of maat in Egyptian thought. 253 6.2.2 Pain and Heart One of the most interesting findings of this dissertation has been the ways in which the expressions [heart + pain + dative] are deployed in the narratives (Chapter 4). Here, it is the referent of the dative who is undergoing the re ality of evil (Sinuhe faces the possibility of dying in the foreign land; Bata the bull is to be executed; Seth is pierced with the barb, etc.). But the one who suffers pain (i.e., the subject of pain) is the possessor of the heart who is not directly him/herself undergoing evil. That these expressions occur at key junctures of the narratives keeps the audience's attention on the bond between the characters. Pain as an experience of evil, when considered on its own without any context, is bad (so much so t hat this sentence amounts to tautology), but when it is oriented towards others, through the medium of the heart, something positive results. The role of the heart is also important in other pain situations. In the magico -medical texts, as the heart is kn own to connect all the parts of the body, its movement and speech are taken as indicators of what is going on inside the body, i.e., what is causing pain. When the physician tries to make sense of the patient's pain not by directly observing the body part that is pained, but by examining the heart that connects all the body parts, the physician is treating the pained body part not as an independent entity, but as that which exists and fu nctions as a part of the whole. In the literary laments and the love s ongs, the heart serves as the speaker's interlocutor. Here, too, frequent references to heart's movement and speech are made. The speakers are not only observing what is going on around them in the external world but are also constantly assessing and refle cting on these situations by talking to their heart. This interior dialogue adds 254 depth to the pain situation; it also invites the audience to think about similar pain situations in their own contexts. 6.2.3 Pain and Speech As mentioned in 6.1, while \"un/sharability\" of pain is the focal point of many critical cultural studies on pain, this dissertation has not engaged w ith the question directly. In so far as the problem of representation and language is concerned, the focus was laid on how texts serve as the durable vehicle or medium of transmitting the values associated with pain. It is important to stress that in the Egyptian texts, the function of language vis -\u00e0-vis pain is primarily performative, in the sense that the language of pain is more about producing an outcome of encountering pain rather than describing pain. Nfr mdt , as we have seen in the case of the Peasa nt, has a major role in fight ing against pain and evil. The p easant (as well as the speakers of the literary laments) is not simply expressing his own experience of pain with his speech, but is tryin g to elicit a concrete response from his audience. That t he pharaoh, instead of taking immediate action to remove the peasant's pain, instead has the peasant keep making eloquent petit ions, seems to be motivated by the concern for the enduring good. In other words, the pharaoh has the peasant's speech written do wn, not because it expresses the peasant's pain well, but because it is pregnant with the power to inspire people to counter pain and evil. Rhetoric, the art of speaking well, does not fully explain the scope of power that is accorded to speech in Egyptian thought and practices. In encountering pain, speech is able to do more than simply instructing or \"persuading\" in the conventional sense.2 For the Egyptians, speaking is an act sui generis . In the magico -medical texts, t he physician is to pronounce (d.rk) the diagnosis after the examination of the patient; the incantations, of course, are 2 Persuading is in quotations marks bec ause persuasive analogy (see n. 108 in Chapter 3) is also a form of persuasion. 255 always to be spoken. Relatedly, as a recent article by Fischer -Elfert draws attention to, d and r go hand in hand not only in the didactic texts, but also in the magico -medical texts for enacting maat .3. From the analysis of the story of Isis and Re (Chapter 3) and the analysis the story of the Shipwrecked sailor (Chapter 4) emerge the striking similarity in encountering pain: both draws on the power of telling the story of a divine prec edence in order to produce the desired outcome. On the whole, evidence here sheds light on the relationship between human agency and speech for encountering pain. A person's role vis-\u00e0-vis pain at first is invariably that of a patient: pain (or circumstances causing pain) simply happens, and it happens regardless of your choosing. Speech, however, is endowed with a creative force and an inseparable aspect of \"doing\" maat . As such, through speech, the patient can be potentially transformed into an agent. Pain's \"un/sharability\" becomes a problem only when one restricts the function of language to its referential/descriptive function. If speech can be put to use to encounter pain, it can also cause pain. In Chapter 4, we saw various instances where somebody suffers pain because of what someone else has said (Anubis' wife lies to her husband that she is suffering from the evil suggestion that Bata made to her; the Pharaoh is pained by Bata's wife; Pre suffers from Baba's comment). In addition, while t his dissertation has not examined them in -depth (only referenced in the footnotes), incantations were frequently used to inflict pain in others. 6.3 Limitations and Future Research While this dissertation has sought to examine diverse aspects of Egyptia n understanding of pain by turning to different genres of anc ient Egyptian texts, not every genre has received equal amount of attention. The analysis of the literary laments in Chapter 5, for instance, would 3 Fischer -Elfert 2021, 181 -182. 256 benefit from more in -depth treatment in the fut ure. Also, the examples from the mortuary texts or royal inscriptions have been included in the lexicographical survey in Chapter 2, but they have not been examined as thoroughly. Mortuary texts and royal inscriptions are undergirded by their own instituti onal history and logic, which in turn call for different sets of contextualizing strategies. 4 Finally, expanding the diachronic range by considering later Demotic texts can also enrich our Egyptian understanding of pain. One could only hope, given more t ime, dissertation would develop into a more comprehensive study that covers wider range of textual sources. The current project can also be extended to shed further light on the significance of the heart in Egyptian thought. While Egyptologists have long acknowledged the importance of the heart in Egyptian thought as the seat of thought and emotion, the topic has not received as adequate or sustained engagement as one could wish for. The notable excepti ons are Assmann and Lichetheim, both providing a history of the developing notion of the heart in Egyptian thought. Assmann, for instance, argues that the role of heart as reflected in the autobiography of Intef dated to the reign of Tuthmoses III, is a development from the Middle Kingdom notion: more than being \"i nerer Motor und Sitz von Wille, Initiati ve und selbstbestimmtem Handeln,\" the heart to figure as a die Lehren in turn chart s out the historical development of the notion of conscience in Egyptian 4 It is also quite obvious that this dissertation has not considered pictorial representations of pain. In much of the Western history, pictorial representations of pained individuals have been quite common; most of the Western cultural hist ories of pain use the pictorial representations as important sources. So not considering pictorial representation may seem like a major limitation of this study. Besides the fact that interpretation of art sources requires yet another kind of skills and kn owledge, based on the general knowledge possessed by the author as well as based on the evidence presented by Prakash (reviewed in the Introduction), it seems fair to say that in ancient Egypt, pictorial representation of pained individual is not as pervas ive in comparison to the later West. Egyptians did not seem to have been very interested in pictorial representation of individuals suffering from pain. A few notable exceptions include, in addition to the cases mentioned in Prakash' study, the famous scen e of the starving Bedouin from the causeway of Sahure's pyramid complex and the defeated enemies in the royal inscriptions. 5 Assmann 1993, 99. 257 thought through a detailed survey of the autobiographical texts and wisdom texts. 6 She concludes that \"the notion of moral sense/conscience did not attain a precise shape embodied in a lexeme\" in Egyptian thought.\"7 If pain can have a history, it seems not unreasonable to think about a h istory of moral conscience , too.8 How does ancient Egyptian understanding of empathy (which, I have argued in this dissertation, as a form of pain) relate to this developing Egyptian notion of moral sense/conscience? This is one of the questions that sur faced while working on this dissertation, something that I would like to address further in my future research. 6 She notes: \"his (Assmann's) observation made me want to determine just how far the Egyptian had come in worki ng out the notion of \"conscience.\" Lichtheim 1997, 72. 7 Lichtheim 1997, 73. She adds \"even in classical Greece the concept of 'conscience,' though formulated, did not become significant.\" Ibid., 74. 8 The discourse on conscience was progressively refined throughout much of the antiquity and into the medieval period. The notion o f conscience and the related notion of synderesis , for instance, served as the locus of Scholastic moral philosophy, most notably in Aquinas's account of natural law. Inquiry into the role of human mind in moral judgement, motivation and action is such an interesting field of research that Egyptology, in my view, has interesting insight to offer. 258 Bibliography Ablow, Rachel. 2017.
