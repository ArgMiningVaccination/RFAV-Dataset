Csaba Lucas, Advising Coach Making the move from Europe to North America, Csaba was first based out of Vancouver, Canada, then later relocated to New York and finally Los Angeles, where he currently resides. Csaba has owned and operated his successful coaching business, Modern Age Warriors Inc., for almost 3 decades. His clients have varied from world-class athletes and sport teams, Fortune 500 companies, Wall Street business leaders, and hundreds of people from every corner of the world and from all walks of life . Csaba finds that the real challenge for people today is to practice evolution, to learn the lessons of the old stories while realizing the modern possibilities and use them both for a holistic life cultivation. When any member of a tribe, a family, a team or a company decides to create a culture of health, vitality and joy within their realm, the benefits of their efforts also spill over to their entire world. A cultivation of such life creates a true adventure. Csaba believes that the critical mass of humanity involved with this type of evolution will change the world from the inside out. As a coach, he designs approaches to address his clients' physical, psychological, social and spiritual balancing.
