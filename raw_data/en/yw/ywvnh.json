A genome sequence of a virus can reveal mutations in a virus that make it unique. Mutations are changes in a genome sequence (usually one-letter changes) and occur naturally over time. Collecting the genome sequence of virus specimens can also reveal information about the relatedness of viruses and the similarities shared among groups of viruses. Groups of same-species viruses that share a set of genome mutations are referred to as a lineage. Scientists compare viral genomes to better understand virus transmission, how viruses can spread from person to person. Sequencing allows Public Health Ocials to monitor viruses involved in outbreaks, characterize outbreaks, detect clusters of cases and monitor new lineages. Novel mutations can emerge with new lineages and scientists refer to these new lineages as emerging variants. Some of these variants are classied by CDC as variants of concern and others as variants of interest, because of their attributes, which can be for example: increased transmissibility, decreased neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, or increased severity of disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has extensive information about the variant classication (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-info.html), which is updated as new evidence becomes available. Sequencing can only be performed on samples that contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which means only samples used for molecular tests (such as PCR) can be included. For this reason, this report is limited to conrmed cases only. The genomes that are sequenced and compared are those of the virus, not humans. Sequencing can be performed on stored specimens at any time. For this reason, the dataset used for this report is dynamic and batches of stored specimens that are newly sequenced will be added to the dataset as sequencing occurs. Because of this, trends based on historical data can change over time. The State of Hawaii has conducted sequencing on approximately 6% of positive specimens that were detected sincethebeginningofthetesting, whichranksamongthebestinthenationaccordingtotheCentersforDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#published-covid-sequences) In February 2021, the State Laboratories Division of the Hawaii Department of Health has ramped up the sequencing done on positive samples to increase the ability to detect the new variants of concern and variants of interest early. Since then, between 15-20% of the samples that were detected positive on PCR Covid-19 tests were sequenced (see below for details). 3Short summary Since Jan 1, 2021, the State Laboratories Division of the Department of Health has sequenced 2599 viral genomes (1527 in Honolulu County, 416 in Maui County, 347 in Hawaii County, 90 in Kauai County and 219 lacking county information). This report also integrates 459 viral genomes that have been generated by CDC and its commercial partners and submitted to GISAID (these viral genomes lack the county information, so they are only reported at the state level), also 28 genomes submitted by Tripler Army Medical Center to GISAID, therefore uses a total of 3086 genomes. Since the last version of this variant report was generated on 8/18/2021 reporting 582 Delta samples detected, 236 additional samples belonging to the Delta variant of concern have been detected and the Delta variant (the lineages B.1.617.2 and AY.*) now accounts for almost all the cases in Hawaii, with very few exceptions. In this report, we show the estimates of the variant proportions by adding up all the sub-lineages that make up one particular variant (e.g. B.1.617.2 and AY.* for Delta), but we show the absolute counts for each individual lineage separately in the total counts graph and in the variant of concern/interest tables. We also switched to a new color scheme, which is similar to the one used currently by CDC to show the dierent variants. 4Signicance of variants of concern and variants of interest It is important to note that evidence to date shows that vaccination leads to milder cases, not requiring hospitalization, for all the variants of concern and variants of interest that are described here, even if the ecacy of antibodies is diminished against some of these variants compared to the original version of the virus. Also,noneof these variants are classied as a \"variant of high consequence\" , according to CDC variant categories (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#Consequence), which is a category that would imply a variant has the ability to evade diagnosis, signicantly reduce the vaccines eectiveness and protection against severe disease, signicantly reduce susceptibility to treatments or lead to more severe disease and increased hospitalizations. Variants of concern Delta variant (B.1.617.2 and AY.* sub-lineages) B.1.617.2 was rst identied in India and it is also known as variant 21A. WHO labeled it Delta on May 31, 2021. This variant contains the L452R mutation in the spike protein that is present in Epsilon variants, plus a few additional spike mutations predicted to have functional consequences (e.g. T478K). The Delta variant is highly contagious, more than 2x as contagious as previous variants. For more information about Delta, go to (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html). Alpha variant (B.1.1.7 and Q.* sub-lineages) B.1.1.7 was rst identied in the United Kingdom and it is also known as VOC202012/01 and 20I/501Y.V1. WHO labeled it \"Alpha\" on May 31, 2021. This variant contains the N501Y mutation and a short deletion in the Spike (S) protein. This variant is concerning because it has been shown to be signicantly more transmissible (~50%) than the original SARS-CoV-2 lineages and recent analyses from the United Kingdom suggest that B.1.1.7 cases are more likely to require hospitalization. B.1.1.7 does not appear to evade vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses. Gamma variant (P.1 and P.1.* sub-lineages) P.1 was rst identied in Brazil and it also known as variant 20J/501Y.V3. WHO labeled it \"Gamma\" on May 31, 2021. This variant also contains the N501Y mutation, like B.1.1.7 but not the deletion in the spike protein. Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies from previous infection or from vaccination may be less eective at preventing infection against this variant. Beta variant (B.1.351 and B.1.351.* sub-lineages) B.1.351 was rst identied in South Africa and it is also known as 20H/501Y.V2. WHO labeled it \"Beta\" on May 31, 2021. This variant is highly infectious and can quickly spread from person to person. Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies from previous infection or from vaccination may be less eective at preventing infection against this variant. 5Variants of interest Iota variant (B.1.526) B.1.526 was rst identied in New York and is classied by CDC as a variant of interest, because there are signs that it has increased transmissibility. WHO has labeled it \"Iota\" on May 31, 2021. Some of the samples (but not all) of this variant contain a mutation (E484K) that is also present in B.1.351 which can potentially make it less responsive to antibodies. Epsilon variant (B.1.429 and B.1.427) These closely related variants, B.1.429 and B.1.427, were rst identied in California and designated initially as CA VUI1. WHO labeled them \"Epsilon\" on May 31, 2021. They can quickly spread from person-to-person, with an estimated ~20% higher eciency than the original virus. CDC has deescalated \"Epsilon\" from a \"variant of concern\" to \"variant of interest\" on June 29, 2021, due to the signicant decrease in the proportion of B.1.429/B.1.427 lineage viruses circulating nationally and available data indicating that vaccines and treatments are eective against this variant. CDC has removed B.1.429 and B.1.427 from the \"variants of interest\" list in July 2021 due to declining prevalence and very few detections in recent months. Zeta variant (P.2) P.2 was rst identied in Brazil and is classied by CDC as a variant of interest. It contains a mutation (E484K) that is also present in B.1.351 which can potentially make it less responsive to antibodies. This variant has been removed from the \"variant of interest\" list in July 2021 due to few detections in recent months. 6State of shows the total number of variants by lineage detected in the State of Hawaii in each 2-week interval ending on the date shown (date represents when the specimen was collected from a patient) Variants of concern are shown as follows orange/brown = Delta (lineages B.1.617.2 + AY.*) , dark blue = Alpha (lineages B.1.1.7 + Q.*), purple = Beta (lineage B.1.351) and green = Gamma (lineages P.1 + P.1.*) Variants of interest are shown in pink: Epsilon (lineages B.1.429 and B.1.427) and Iota (lineage B.1.526) The red line graph above it shows the percentage of the PCR-test positive samples from each 2-week time interval that were sequenced.

This gure does not estimate the prevalence of the population. - Sequencing can be performed on stored patient specimens at any time, so these numbers may change as additional specimens are sequenced, especially for the last 2-week period, for which a number of samples are currently being processed. 7Estimate of proportion of variants circulating in the sequencedVariant Other Alpha Delta Gamma Beta Iota Epsilon Notes: The chart above shows the estimate of biweekly percentages of the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the State of Hawaii, grouped in two-week intervals (based on the date of collection of samples). Not all positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens are sequenced and sequenced specimens are not a random selection of all COVID-19 cases in Hawaii. This chart has been generated only counting samples that were selected randomly for the purpose of surveillance, to avoid over-representing the samples that were selected for investigations of clusters. The last 2-week interval numbers will most likely change, as a number of samples that are currently being processed will be added. Sequencing of certain specimens can be delayed for technical reasons. For this reason, the dataset used for this report is dynamic and specimens that are newly sequenced will be added to the dataset as sequencing occurs. Because of this, trends based on historical data can change over time. 8Variants of concern in the State of Hawaii Variant Lineage Area of emergence Cumulative cases detectedEarliest specimen collection dateMost recent specimen collection date Delta 818 B.1.617.2 India 578 18 May 2021 14 Aug 2021 AY.25 United States 8021 Jun 2021 10 Aug 2021 AY.3 United States 58 28 Jun 2021 09 Aug 2021 AY.2 United States 2901 Jun 2021 22 Jul 2021 Europe 25 30 Jun 2021 10 Aug 2021 United States 1924 Jun 2021 02 Aug 2021 States 05 United States/Mexico910 Jul 2021 Jul 2021 Alpha 729 B.1.1.7 United Kingdom 685 21 Jan 2021 02 Aug 2021 Q.3 United States 4421 Mar 2021 Jul 2021 P.1 Brazil 10321 Mar 2021 21 Jul 2021 P.1.10 United States 80 24 Apr 2021 13 Jul 2021 Beta B.1.351 South Africa 1516 Feb 2021 08 Jul 2021 Variants of interest in the State of Hawaii Variant Lineage Area of emergence Cumulative cases detectedEarliest specimen collection dateMost recent specimen collection date Epsilon 771 B.1.429 California 712 31 Dec 2020 03 California 5907 Dec 2020 05 Iota York 128 06 23 Jul 2021 9Honolulu County Total shows the total number of variants detected in Honolulu County in each 2-week interval ending on the date shown - (date represents when the specimen was collected from a patient) Variants of concern are shown as follows orange/brown = Delta (lineages B.1.617.2 + AY.*) , dark blue = Alpha (lineages B.1.1.7 + Q.*), purple = Beta (lineage B.1.351) and green = Gamma (lineages P.1 + P.1.*) Variants of interest are shown in pink: Epsilon (lineages B.1.429 and B.1.427) and Iota (lineage B.1.526) The red line graph above it shows the percentage of the PCR-test positive samples from each 2-week time interval that were sequenced.
