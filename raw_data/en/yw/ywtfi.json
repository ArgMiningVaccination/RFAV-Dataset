Thousands of parents continue to affirm that their children became autistic shortly after immunization with the MMR vaccine. Statistical studies however, claim to the satisfaction of the majority of the scientific community, that there is no such relationship(1). This paper, representing over 20 years of study, offers a new theory based on experimental evidence, subject observation and published scientific research. The highly controversal (and presently refuted) relationship between the attenuated measles vaccine and autism, has never been experimentally testable. This research may offer the opportunity to perform reasonable medical tests to effectively confirm or deny a relationship between the attenuated measles vaccine and autism. This expanded version, will hopefully offer the reader theoretical insights into several critical issues that were not addressed in the initial version. First, how theoretically a non-immunized child could develop autism. Second, how consistant changes to the measles virus after attenuation (weakening), could theoretically support the suggested mechanisms. Lastly, a suggested unification of the two prevailing theories of autism (genetic and environmental) is offered. Abstract: It is hypothesized that the measles N protein component of the attenuated (vaccine derived) measles virus, chronically interfers with a specific homeostatic mechanism that provides balance between metabolic and immune function, resulting in autism. First, congenital metabolic diseases or risk factors, produce primary LOCAL and CONTINUING SUPPRESSIONS of enzymatic and immune functions. Critical among these risk factors is extremely low or non-existent secretory IgA. Second, the overall cellular homeostatic environment is then severely affected by GLOBAL and TRANSIENT metabolic and immune SUPPRESSIONS from the attenuated measles vaccination. Third, the combined effects of severe immune/enzymatic suppressions from the attenuated measles virus, severely reduced IgA, and other CMD's, allows opportunistic infections to flourish, which support secondary immune and enzyme suppressions. Finally, all these suppressions produce a severe intracellular messenger-metabolite flux reduction, which allows the attenuated measles N protein freedom to interact, and interfere with, the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3P40. eIF3P40 is joined to the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E through an eIF4G linkage. Theoretically, this would create a severe dysregulation in the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E, which has been observed in autistic children, and associated with autistic behavior in animal studies. This severe messenger-metabolite flux reduction from reduced secretory IgA and other CMD's, immune repression from opportunistic infections and consequent and continuing attenuated measles virus latency, results in an ongoing inability to achieve homeostasis between metabolic functions and immune functions. This manifests as autism. Three tests of this theory are possible. First, treatment with vaccine derived (attenuated) measles N protein specific secretory immunoglobulin A, which is capable of neutralizing the interference. Theoretically, such a test/treatment would restore homeostasis, with a gradual improvement of the autistic condition. Second, it is proposed that if (vaccine derived) attenuated measles N protein specific IgA is properly administered concurrent to infant measles vaccination, few if any cases of autism should be observed, while still providing protection against measles. Third, immunization of the mother with MMR vaccine and subsequent immunization of the child during concurrent breastfeeding. Theoretically, children could then receive sufficient attenuated measles specific secretory IgA via breast milk with few if any cases of autism (or measles) observed. If correct, these tests could provide empirical evidence of an indirect relationship between autism and attenuated measles virus/vaccination. Experimental Observations: AUTHOR'S DISCLAIMER: THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS ARE NOT A SAFE VIABLE TREATMENT FOR AUTISM! NO PARENT SHOULD ATTEMPT TO USE SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE AND/OR SOY MILK TO TREAT THEIR CHILD'S AUTISM! YOU WILL ENDANGER YOUR CHILD! YOU WILL HARM YOUR CHILD! Observed subject is author's son. There are no conflicts of interest. 0.3 grams of living Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a common brewers yeast obtained from LALVIN(2), identification code K1-V1116, was mixed with 150 ml of sterile water to form a suspension at room temperature. 10 -30 ml of this suspension was administered on an empty stomach, to regressive 68 kilogram male autistic teenager X, resulting in significant improvement in autistic behavior and vocalizations within 30 - 45 minutes. S. cerevisiae enhances phase II enzyme production, while inhibiting the Th2 component of the immune system(3). Higher suspension concentrations or doses at first offered similar improvement, but eventually produced a worsening of autistic symptoms and vocalizations. 15-40 ml of a non-diluted nonsugared basic soymilk preperation, brand name \"SOY SILK\"(4), was administered at the start of these worsening phases, with dramatic improvement observed within 30 minutes. Soy milk enhances the Th2 component of the immune system, while inhibiting phase II enzymes(5). On seperate occasions, 15-30 ml of soy milk was administered alone, on an empty stomach, to teenager X, with similar improvement observed within 30 - 45 minutes. Higher doses of soy milk were administered with autistic improvement, then worsening, and again, corrected with 10 - 25 ml of the S. cerevisiae suspension. Subtle changes in autistic behaviors, vocalizations and physical response (herein refered to as \"symptom clusters\"), determined treatment choice. Enhanced autistic mannerisms with wet hands and poor and reduced verbal ability, one symptom cluster, neccesitated S. cerevisiae. Soy milk was required for enhanced autistic mannerisms with intense lip licking, dry hands and animated verbalization, another unique symptom cluster. Each particular symptom cluster was exacerbated or reduced by S. cerevisiae or soy milk, as stated. These observations provided evidence that two different symptom clusters could exist within the same autistic individual. Based apon the inherent and opposing properties of Soy milk and S. Cerevisiae, these unique symptom clusters, may provide indirect evidence for a Th2 immunity/phase II enzyme imbalence related downstream to autism, in teenager X. note: Published research has shown that autistic children have a dysregulation of Th1 and Th2 transcription (59) with a Th1/Th2 imbalance toward Th2(95). Discussion One: Metabolic and Immune Homeostasis In rare instances, a temporary balance between the TH2/Th1 and phase II/phase I systems using soy milk and S. cerevisiae suspensions, was achieved in teenager X for 15 - 20 minutes. Only residual autistic behavioral abnormalities were observed. These residual autistic characteristics may be resultant from the long term consequences of metabolic and immunological imbalance on the autistic child's brain and blood flow to the brain(6). Attempts to replicate these results with commercially obtained Saccharomyces boulardii were unsuccessful. No changes at similar dosages were observed. This raises a serious question: Why were there no immunological or enzymatic changes observed with S. boulardii usage? S. boulardii and S. cerevisiae are nearly identical(7). Both can alter the Th1/Th2 immune and phase I/phase II enzyme balance(8). The difference may lie in the fact that S. cerevisiae has greater gene copy and chromosomal numbers. Specifically, S. cerevisiae has far more retrotransposons (8)(9). Retrotransposons also called Ty elements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are DNA sequences that can regulate gene expression and transpose via RNA in a host cell(10).They are similar to retroviruses. In particular, they function as enhancers or promotors by neutralizing a host cell's gene inactivation(11)(12). The observation that only S cerevisiae effected change, appears to indicate that in autism, some mechanism(s) involved with phase II enzyme production are inactivated. This inactivation, prevented S boulardii from naturally enhancing phase II enzyme production, while reducing a Th2 response. Since both systems appear impaired, and they balance against each other, it is therefore reasonable to conjecture that the actual site of impairement may lie between them, at some point of homeostasis. There are multiple interacting mechanisms involved with maintaining cellullar homeostasis between the PhaseII/PhaseI enzyme system and the Th2/Th1 system(13)(14)(15) (author's note: the listed references barely touch apon the complexity and number of interactions between metabolism and the immune system.) The observations presented here offer the possibility that one of these homeostatic mechanisms may be partially compromised in teenager X, with autistic symptoms a downstream effect. abstract quote: \"Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that abnormal ...., metabolism, and/or immune function are common features of ASD, and therefore a focus on restoring homeostasis may offer the most broad-based solution for reducing core behavioral symptoms and possibly comorbidities.\" Masino S, Fortin J, etal. Homeostatic Control Of Brain Function, Oxford University Press (240) Additional observations of teenager X offer further evidence for this theory. Apon arising in the morning, with no food consumption for 8 hours, teenager X characteristically exhibited few autistic symptoms, and was at his best. As food was consumed, more autistic behaviors emerged. With larger nutritionally complex meals, autistic severity increased dramatically. Since as stated, several mechanisms contribute to cellular homeostasis, inhibition of one mechanism, during normal food consumption, may temporally overwhelm homeostasis, producing the observed effects. When small, well spaced \"meal snacks\" were consumed rather then regular size meals, behavior and cognition remained more stable. Behaviors also severely deteriorated after inhalation of diesel fuel oxidation products(16), or drinking plain water accidently allowed to sit in warm commercial plastic bottles(17). The airborne oxidation byproducts as well as the \"leached out\" plastic bottle residues appeared to overwhelm the normally adaptive homeostatic system(s), producing a severely autistic response. Experimental evidence of such changes exist. Chang(2018) etal. was able to induce autistic-like behaviors in mice exposed to diesel fuel oxidation fumes(18). Commonly observed biological responses in autistic children can also be explained using this theory. Increased autistic response from intake of high phenol content foods is one example (19). Reduced levels of the phenol sulphotransferase enzyme which processes phenolic compound foods is often found in autistic children(20). A functional reduction in these enzymes and others, would be expected under this theory. Reduction in digestive enzymes have been observed in autistic children(21). Teenager X also suffered adversely when high phenol content foods were consumed. Reported food and other allergies in autistic children(23) may also be redefined as a failure of homeostasis. According to this theory it may occur in two ways: The processing of endogenous or exogenous substances for assimilation, breakdown or elimination (food, hormones, smoke, etc) requires two types of enzymes: phase I enzymes and phase II enzymes(21). Phase I enzymes (cytochrome P450 enzymes) begin the process by enzymatically activating these substances, making them more polar(22). This process however, also makes them more toxic, especially for brain and liver function and more available for immune system activation. Phase II enzymes essentially makes these substances water soluable (and significantly less toxic and less immunogenic), which allows for (as stated) their breakdown, integration into the body, or elimination(21). However, when phase II enzymes are diminished, via homeostatic failure, these activated substances can provoke a strong \"innate\" immune response along with their stated toxic effects(23). The end result is the increase in observed autistic behaviors. Second, as these activated substances continue to appear in the the circulation, their short term toxic and immunological effects become exacerbated by the formation of long term memory cells, and antibody production in a \"specific\" immune response directed at dietary proteins(23)(24)(57).This increases the \"allergy-like\" response, via enhanced levels of mediators of inflamation such as histamine, IgE and leukotrienes(25). As would be expected under this theory, reduced concentrations of anti-inflamatory cytokines, as well as the increased concentrations of pro-inflamatory cytokines are observed in autistic children (25)(26). Autistic symptom severity has been associated with increased levels of pro-inflamatory cytokines(27). This long term immunological/metabolic dysregulation can also cause severe reduction to blood brain flow (28)(29). This blood flow reduction would limit the availability of nutrients and oxygen to the brain. It would also produce a build up of toxic metabolic byproducts in neural tissues. The consequences would be the abnormally high neural cell death, disrupted interneuronal connections, and enhanced levels of neural autoimmune antibodies, that is observed in autism(30)(31)(32). Neural autoimmune antibodies are produced in the brain to assist in the removal of dead and dying neural cells.These autoimmune antibodies would be produced as a normal response to neural cell death and injury, and not as a cause of autism as has been suggested in published literature(33). As mentioned, autistic children are often found to have reduced blood brain flow associated with immune dysregulation. This blood flow reduction reduces oxygen and nutrient levels in the brain, while allowing for the build up of toxic metabolic byproducts. This results in an increase in neural cell death(28)(29). Simultaneous to this increased neural cell death and the related immune response, would be the enhanced neural cell growth and differentiation that occurs in the developing child's brain(34). These two competing forces could easily produce the gross and subtle morphological differences observed in the autistic child's brain(35)(36). These observations detract from the theory that autistic brain morphology has a purely genetic origin(37)(72)(91). *A special note about autism and testosterone in boys at puberty. Male children tend to be more adversely affected by autism then females(38)(39). While testosterone is a vital part of male maturation in boys, it is also neurotoxic(40)(41). Delayed processing by phase II enzymes, as would occur in this theory, would increase testosterone metabolic half-life as well as increase it's neurotoxicity(22). This may provide a partial explanation for puberty related autistic regression observed in males, and also observed in teenager X. Discussion Two: A Theory For Treatment A Test Of Theory: AUTHOR'S NOTE: IT IS CRITICAL THAT ANY EXPERIMENTAL SECRETORY IGA PREPERATION COLLECTED, HUMAN SOURCED OR SYNTHESIZED, ORIGINATE FROM ATTENUATED MEASLES N PROTEIN AND NOT NATURALLY OCCURING MEASLES VIRUS N-PROTEIN. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY PRODUCE ERRONEOUS AND/OR MISLEADING RESULTS. As noted previously, any relationship between measles vaccine and autism has been statistically refuted. The following theory and test may produce results counter to that conclusion or offer further support. Multiple interacting homeostatic mechanisms exist to balance between the Th1/Th2 and phase I/phase II systems. One such site to maintain homeostatic balence is eukayrotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which the eIF3p40 eukaryotic initiation site(14)(15). Eukarotic initiation factors (eIFs) are post-translational proteins or protein complexes that regulate the physical expression of gene directed cellular products(42)(43).* *The process begins with the transcription of genes from the DNA template in the nucleus into RNA via the enzyme RNA polymerase. After additional processing, the formed RNA strand representing at minimum one gene, can exit the nucleus into the cytoplasm via a nuclear pore. The RNA strand (template) is translated into cell products (for example an enzyme) via ribosomes or the endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Cell product formation as stated, is regulated by the eukaryotic initiation factors involved with ribosomes and intracellular environment(44)(45). The initiation site, eIF3P40 can be blocked by the N protein of the measles virus (49). Autistic children suffer from dysregulation of the local eIF4E translation initiation factor (47). The eIF4E initiation site and eIF3p40 initiation site are associated via eIF4G, which performs a bridging function (48). It is reasonable to conjecture that the blocking of one initiation factor can influence another associated adjacent initiation factor, and interfere downstream with TH2/TH1 and PhaseII/Phase I homeostasis. This eIF4E dysregulation has been associated with autistic behavior in animal models(46) (see below). Santini E etal in \"Exaggerated Traslation Causes Synaptic and Behavioral Aberrations Associated With Autism\" (Nature 2013) produced autistic-like behavior in transgenic mice by altering translation levels in the eIF4E initiation site. They were then able to reverse the autistic-like behaviors: quote: \"...by reducing eIF4E/eIF4G interactions, thereby restoring homeostasis.\"(46) The hypothesis that autism in humans is caused by initiation site dysregulation may be testable in humans by employing human derived secretory IgA* specific to the attenuated measles N protein(87). antibodies (IgA, IgG, IgD,IgM and IgE) are glycoproteins produced by B cells in response to, and that combine with, foreign substances or antigens(50). *Secretory IgA is formed when the dimeric form of IgA is bound to a secretory component, which protects it against proteolysis. It's sources include breast milk, saliva, and intestinal secretions(56). It is unique among antibodies/immunoglobulins in being able to function intracellularly(50). Autistic children are routinely found to have subnormal secretory IgA levels, yet elevated non-IgA immunoglobulin titers(51)(52)(55). This contrasts drastically with normal measles infection or immunization, which produces large increases in measles specific IgA in children (54). Secretory IgA can penetrate infected human cells, and directly neutralize specific viral sub-components. This is accomplished via the: summary quote: \"three defense functions of immunoglobulin A (IgA) virus excretion\" Immunogobulin A specific to attenuated measles N protein may be obtained by administering purified attenuated measles N protein, derived from standard measles vaccine type strains, to healthy human volunteers. Over an immunologically limited time period*, purified secretory IgA specific to attenuated measles N protein could be obtained, then administered to a severely autistic test subject. If this conjecture is correct, attenuated measles N protein specific secretory IgA could neutralize the interference and restore the affected homeostastic mechanism. Long term neutralization might be achievable by maintaining human derived attenuated measles N protein specific secretory IgA at levels equivalent to physiological norms for an unspecified time period. Empirical evidence of success could be obtained via enzyme and immune studies. Behavioral and vocalization improvement should also be demonstrable. *\"An immunologically limited time period\" refers to the half-life, storage life, refrigeration needs, etc, required to maintain the efficacy of secretory IgA prior to successful administration. There are also time constraints associated with the collection of sufficent quantities of biologically active attenuated measles N protein specific secretory IgA, after administration of the attenuated measles N protein to the volunteer(58). Special Note: The question arises as why not simply give secretory IgA specific to several or all attenuated measles proteins? Based on the research and observations stated, the key secretory IgA in relation to correcting the homeostatic dysregulation, is specific to the attenuated N protein. Additional secretory IgA's specific to other attenuated measles virus proteins could potentially be very helpful, but would require other technologies still in developement. Research is presently being conducted on plant based production of specific secretory IgA's, which shows great promise(61). Should such technology mature sufficiently, a safe and efficacious \"soup\" of attenuated measles protein specific secretory IgA's may one day be possible. Admittedly, such a treatment could be potentially superior (62)(63). Strong caution however, would need to be observed should such testing be attempted. The possibility of a strong physiological response as the immune and enzyme systems reassert themselves after long term imbalance is a possibility. This concern is not without precedent. Autistic children treated for chronic Candida infections with antifungals or Transfer Factor, often experienced a temporary worsening of their autism during the \"die off\" phase before noticably improving(60). A homeopathic test dosage of human derived attenuated measle N protein specific secretory IgA at start, with a gradual increase in dosage under strict medical supervision, would be strongly reccomended. Attenuated measles N protein specific human derived secretory IgA could offer a viable autism treat- ment option(94). It could also offer real experimental, rather than statistical evidence in regard to any involvement of measles and autism. Discussion Three: The Combined Effects Of Non-measles Local and Continuing Suppression With Measles Vaccine Global and Transient Suppression Based on previous observations and published research, measles vaccination alone is clearly insufficient to result in autism without some other predisposing factor(s). This is reasonable in that if a measles vaccine alone could produce autism, far more immunized children would become autistic. This is clearly not the case, as referred statistical studies demonstrate(1). However, if such a relationship in any form exists, LOCAL and CONTINUING immune and enzymatic SUPPRESSIONS, may provide the theoretical predisposing factors. These LOCAL and CONTINUING SUPPRESSIONS of various enzymatic mechanisms and immune systems, could be developmental, genetic, environmental, iatrogenic, microbial (viral, fungal or bacterial) or some combination. Specific combinations could reflect apon the differing severities, the incidence of autistic regression, and recovery from autism. These are commonly refered to as \"risk factors\" for autism(64)(3)(6)(16) (18)(37)(40)(70)(68)(67)(69)(96)(105)(106). Examples of risk factors, include the long list of \"inborn errors of metabolism\", in which genes that code for certain enzymes/gene products are not functioning properly or at all(105). Also referred to as congenital metabolic diseases (CMD's), these diseases are noted for frequent co-morbidity with autism(105)(106). Some examples of individual CMD can be uncommon, there are hundreds known(105)(106), and an unknown number yet to be discovered. The total percentage of autistic children who have any or several CMD's is unknown. Evidence for CMD involvement in autism is demonstrated by the autistic children whose symptoms have been significantly modified by various supplements to ameliorate the particular deficiency(104). Additional risk factors include: environmental assoc. candida infection(107) autism assoc. Further evidence for risk factors, and the resultant LOCAL and CONTINUING SUPPRESSIONS, can be derived from the succeeding HISTORY section in regard to teenager X. Theoretically, these deficiencies as a whole, could be represented in a biophysical sense, as reductions in the intracellular messenger-metabolite flux(see below). LOCAL and CONTINUING suppressions as represented by risk factors or CMD's, could theoretically provide the first level of suppression of the intracellular messenger- metabolite* flux**, which occupies the intra- cellular fluid between the attacking attenuated measles N protein, and the eIF3P40 initiation site. This flux, when functioning normally, would theoretically prevent the measles N protein from dysregulating the eIF3p340 initiation site. *Intracellular messengers and metabolites includes all transcriptional-translational products. These provide continuous communication between the nucleus and organelles in the cytoplasm(43)(44) **\"intracellular messenger-metabolite flux\" refers to the millions of metabolic communications flowing back and forth within the cell in a millisecond. These communications keep the cell alive and in homeostasis. Any interference between a particular messenger or metabolite and its site of destination, is also called steric hindrance(84). The second level of intracellular messenger-metabolite flux suppression would be conducted by the proteins of the measles virus (along with the measles N protein). The measles virus proteins, produce profound GLOBAL and TRANSIENT down-regulation of cellular products(113)(114)(117)(119), originating from the cell's \"housekeeping genes\"*. *\"Housekeeping genes\"(120) provide basic cellular maintenance that keeps the cell alive and functioning normally. They constitute the majority of genes in the nucleus. Among the many genes coded for, are those for transcription and translation factors, tRNA synthesis, ribosomal proteins, and components of metabolism. All these contribute to the intracellular messenger-metabolite flux. The measles virus as a whole consists of the Large protein (L protein), Nucleoprotein (N protein), Phosphoprotein (P protein), Matrix protein (M protein), Fusion protein (F protein), Hemagglutinin protein (H protein), V protein C protein and RNA(49)(112)(74)(116)(115). Specific examples of measles protein inhibitions include; N protein - local inhibition of homeostatic regulation via the eIF3P450 initiation site and inhibition of secretory IgA(49) V protein - interferon signaling inhibition(112), suppression of NF-kB transcription factor(65) M protein - global (various sites) inhibition of host cell transcription(74) P protein - Type 1 interferon inhibition, inflamatory response suppression(116) C protein - Beta interferon transcription inhibition(115) A third level of immune/enzyme suppression that could occur would be caused by opportunistic infections occurring as a result of suppressions by measles virus, low secretory IgA, and other CMD's(145)(146). These infections can exert their own repressions on immunity and/or enzyme function. In this theory, as a result of these immune and enzymatic product suppressions, and further suppressions from opportunistic infections, the normal levels of intracellular messenger-metabolite flux could be reduced to a critical level. This steric hindrance which stands in the way of the attenuated measles N protein, when severely reduced, allows the eIF3P40 eucaryotic initiation site to be vulnerable to attack by the attenuated measles N protein*. *Like the archer that can't hit the target because of multiple flocks of birds rapidly flying back and forth between him and his goal, the strong reduction of the bird flux, lets the archer to score a bulls eye. . This theory enables inclusivity for the extremely broad and varied risk factors associated with autism. Any risk factor which reduces intracellular messenger-metabolite flux, or reduces the immune response, increases the risk of attenuated measles virus N protein initiation site interference. Theoretically, this sequence of events of LOCAL and CONTINUING SUPRESSIONS from CMD's(especially secretory IgA deficiency), GLOBAL and TRANSIENT suppressions by the measles virus, growth of oportunistic infections (example candida), and initiation site specific supressions, could also set in motion the process for measles virus latency. Published research has clearly demonstrated that the measles virus is capable of establishing a latent intracellular presence(77)(78)(75)(76)(79)(80)(81). The latent measles genome then continues to produces N protein, which suppresses IgA, etc. Proof of this in autistic children, is the vastly reduced or lack of secretory IgA antibody, yet increased production of non- IgA antibodies to measles virus, years after immunization(83). A theoretical final stage of autism may be reached by those individuals who eventually suffer from severe regressive autism. Should a latent measles infection spread to stem cells, then viral proliferation would occur along with these cells(81). Viral latency can cause immune dysfunction via long term viral reservoirs that are non-infectious.(128) Puberty with its growth and maturation spurts has been associated with severe regressions in some autistic individuals(73)(90). As previously noted, for males entering puberty, the potent addition of neurotoxic activated testosterone would only exacerbate the regression. One question exists: Why were there not more cases of autism prior to large scale immunization, during measles outbreaks? Natural measles infection coupled with pre- existing risk factors could have produced occasional autistic conditions. The answer to this question may be both historic as well as diagnostic. Autism was not identified as a (rare) seperate condition until 1943 by Leo Kanner(96). Prior to this, the condition was lumped in with other psychological and mental defect diagnosies. Prior to large scale immunization, infant and child mortality was high for this and other diseases, malnutrition and warfare associated events(147). Additionally, it is theorized here that the attenuation process that produces measles vaccine, alters measles virus in ways that enhance the risk potential for autism. This conjecture will be discussed in detail further on in this presentation. Discussion Four: The Critical Role Of Secretory Immunoglobulin A In Autism It has been hypothesized here, that secretory IgA can be used to treat immune/enzymatic homeostatic dysregulation and resultant autism. The question thus arises, could secretory IgA deficiency in infants, be the pivotal risk factor for this condition? Of the listed Congenital Metabolic Diseases (CMD's), or risk factors, the most commonly found in autistic children is secretory IgA deficiency(51)(52)(53). This is significant, since non-autistic children normally produce large amounts of measles specific IgA after immunization, while autistic children do not(54). Secretory IgA normally increases with age in the first 6 months of life(131). As has been stated, congenital metabolic diseases (or risk factors) are considered individually to be rare. However, this viewpoint repeated in numerous research reports, does not accurately reflect the published data in regard to secretory IgA deficiency. As stated by Urbanas V, etal in Med Sci Monit (2016): quote: \"selective Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency is the most common inherited immunodeficiency disorder worldwide\"(132) And according to Shkalim V, etal. in Clin Immunol.(2010): quote: \"IgA deficiency appears to be a risk factor for infections, allergic diseases, autoimmune conditions, and malignancy.\"(136) It is significant that IgA deficiency in children is so common, that a diagnosis under four years of age may be considered simply transient and a result of developmental delay(122). The diagnosis itself can be misleading, since it is based on monomeric blood serum IgA, rather than the dimeric secretory IgA of the gastro-intestinal mucosa(148). Independent studies have demonstrated that on average, 25 percent of infants (premature to 1 year of age), demonstrated undetectable levels of secretory IgA: study one: In Infants 6 weeks to 2 1/2 years secretory IgA was detected in 72% of salivary samples.(127) study two: 73 newborn infants (1 day old) secretory IgA was detected in 74.0% of all saliva samples (130) In seperate studies, Sudhir Gupta MD and Reed Warren phD determined that 20 percent of autistic children had IgA deficiency. It should be noted however, that this measurement is for serum IgA not secretory IgA(140)(141). These rates are far beyond what would be considered a \"rare\" condition by any acceptible standard. Dismissing the condition as \"developmental\" should in no way diminish it's importance to infant health. Secretory IgA deficiency, which is considered a primary immune deficiency*, can also contribute to secondary immune deficiencies**. Thus secretory IgA deficiency as a single risk factor, can contribute to the production of additional autistic risk factors. *Primary immune deficiencies occur when one or more components of the immune system is severely reduced or non-existant due to genetic and/or developmental causes. They can remain undiagnosed or produce re-occuring infections or other medical disorders(151). **Secondary immune deficiencies are an indirect consequence of a primary immune deficiency. The primary deficiency can allow a microrganism to become established as a chronic infection. This chronic infection itself (whether microbial, viral or fungal) can then produce an additional immune deficiency or repression(152)(153). Severe immunoglobulin A deficiency has been indirectly linked with autism. In one study, a subset of autistic children was concurrently diagnosed with severe IgA deficiency(137). These children were susceptible to frequent viral infections. The severity of these infections was positively corelated with an increase in autistic symptoms (137). In another study, it was determined that the lower the levels of salivary secretory IgA, the greater the severity of behavioral disorders and impairment in autistic children(139) In addition, when intravenous immunoglobulins, which contain IgA, have been administered to some autistic children, improvement has been observed(199). Insufficent secretory IgA can provide an environment conducive to intestinal lymphoid tissue inflamation, similar to that observed in colitis and Crohn's disease. This has been observed in some autistic children(138). Normal levels of secretory IgA in the gastrointestinal tract can help to avoid this, by providing for a homeostatic balence between essential commensal bacteria and inflamation causing pathogenic microrganisms(142). Autistic children are often found to have dysbiosis and gastrointestinal inflamation associated with low or IgA gastrointestinal tract(149). Fungal infections such as chronic Candida albicans is one cause of dysbiosis(82), and is commonly found in autistic children(85). Teenager X began suffering from chronic and debilitating Candida infections within days of measles immunization. Chronic Candida infections can produce further immune suppression (118) (150), which could further enhance the dybiosis. The severity of the dysbiosis directly corelates with autistic severity(143) (164). Special Note: It is common for parents to administer acetaminophen or ibuprofen concurrent to MMR vaccination for fever and/or pain relief. Some non-steroidal anti-inflamatory drugs however, have been associated with IgA deficiency(198). Given the theoretical framework presented here, it is possible that some infant medications could exacerbate a pre-existing secIgA deficiency. As suggested, administration of secretory IgA prior to immunization may enable avoidance of such conditions. Breast milk is very high in secretory IgA(56). A recently immunized lactating mother, could administer breast milk prior to, and continuing after, measles immunization. If the infant has the previously mentioned risk factors this could be critical to preventing such conditions from occuring(93)(111). Autistic infants in general, have been shown to have a reduced amount of breast feeding then normal infants(166). Immunoglobulin A deficiency can also interfere with the normal response to live vaccines. BCG, yellow fever, and polio vaccines are contraindicated if IgA deficiency exists(144). Logically, one should now ask whether the measles vaccine specifically, is contraindicated under conditions of IgA deficiency. Public health vaccine recomendations at this time consider it safe to immunize a child with serum IgA deficiency(165). However, this positive recomendation does not take into account the consequences of any resultant secondary immune deficiencies, and any additional congenital metabolic diseases or risk factors. Repeated PUBLIC MEDLINE searchs for secretory IgA deficiency as a contraindication to measles immunization, have yielded no reference results whatsoever. Based on published research, this author believes strongly that secretory IgA deficiency in infants has been medically marginalized as to its importance both in overall infant health, and possibly as a factor in autism. Secretory IgA deficiency should, as referenced from multiple experimental studies, be reclassified as the predominant medical abnormality of newborns. Diminished levels of IgA has been associated with increased levels of viral, bacterial and fungal infections(158)(159)(160), and measles latency(161). Restated in this context, it is theorized that the primary predisposing risk factor, or \"smoking gun\" of extremely low or non-existant secretory IgA, in conjunction with with one or more additional congenital metabolic disorders or risk factors, and secondary opportunistic infections, enables the steric hindrance of the intracellular environment for measles N protein related dysregulation of homeostasis. Infants under this combination of conditions may be at greatly increased risk of autism apon attenuated measles immunization. It is strongly suggested here that regular routine testing of all newborn/infant secretory IgA levels should be a required part of the examination schedule. Should levels be subnormal, immediate efforts should be taken to elevate those levels to normal ranges. This is regardless of whether the child is to be immunized or not, as will be explained in Discussion Five. Discussion Five: Non-Vaccinated Children Who Become Autistic Vaccinated Children Who Do Not Become Autistic Stated once again, statistical studies have demonstrated no relationship between measles immunization and autism(1). This conclusion is further supported by the two \"elephants\" in the room; non-vaccinated autistic children and vaccinated non-autistic children. Thus, any hypothesized measles/autism relationship must out of necessity, address these two observations. The first step toward these goals, is to establish all routes of exposure for both attenuated measles*/vaccination form and non-attenuated measles/classic disease Transmission(167)(168)(170): 1. attenuated measles* injection (MMR vaccine) 2. environmental (air and surface exposure) 3. infected person to non-infected person transmission (asymptomatic** and classic measles***) 4. iatrogenic spread ( healthcare worker mediated) 5. live attenuated virus shed by a recently vaccinated individual *attenuated measles vaccination refers to a weakened form of the virus injected to produce immunity. This weakened form is alive and transmissible but does not produce classic measles symptoms(169). **asymptomatic measles occurs when an individual infected with measles does not demonstrate the classic symptoms of measles, appears healthy, but can still re-transmit the virus(170). ***classic measles symptoms (rubeola) include high fever, Koplik's spots, sore throat, conjuctivitis, dry cough, runny nose and a blotchy skin rash. It can cause death in susceptible individuals. The disease is transmissable from four days before a rash appears, to four days after a rash appears(167)(171). Regardless of the route of exposure however, measles is considered to be one of the most highly contagious diseases on Earth(173). According to the Center For Disease Control (U.S. CDC) in \"Transmission Of Measles\": quote: \"measles is so contagious that if one person has it, up to ninety percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected(173)\" quote: \"measles virus can live up to two hours in an air space after an infected person leaves an area(173)\" Of these vectors of transmission however, live attenuated measles virus shed from an immunized person to a non-immunized person causing measles, is considered by medical experts, to be a rare event(176). This is not a fully accurate statement however. Live attenuated measles virus shedding after immunization is common(182), while the incidence of classic measles caused by this, is a rare event(176). When measles virus is attenuated or weakened, it normally will not cause full blown measles in a healthy individual (169). If this be the case, what might occur if vaccine shedding* of the attenuated measles virus occurs in a vaccinated primary host and an immunocompromised** secondary host is infected? *vaccine shedding - Just as a person infected with a live wild type virus can \"shed\" viral particles into the environment, so to can a recipient of an attenuated (weakened) virus from a vaccine, shed active virus into the environment(183) (184) **To be immunocompromised refers to the body's inability to defend itself against micro- organisms and other nonself materials. These deficiencies can involve defects in the operation of macrophages, neutrophiles, lymphocytes, antibodies, the complement system, or cytokine system(185)(186). As previously stated, secretory immunoglobulin A was found to play a major role in the body's response to measles exposure(136). Secretory immunoglobulin A deficiency was noted to be extremely common in infants, and specifically autistic children(51)(52)(53). Such children can and must be considered to be immunocompromised. According to Kamboj and Sekowitz in Infection Control Hospital Epidemiology 2007 June: abstract quote: \"Persons who receive live attenuated vaccine may occasionally transmit the vaccine strain to others. The risk of such transmission is a concern, especially for persons who provide care to immunocompromised patients (i.e. family and healthcare workers)(182)\" The mode of transmission would not require direct contact, only a shared environment. A simple cough, and rebreathing of infected air, could re-transmit the attenuated measles virus. As stated PNAS,2021: quote: \"LAMV(live attenuated measles can efficiently establish pulmonary infection without producing a viremia(172). Also according to Lobermann, Borso, Jan: abstract quote: \"The number of patients with impaired immune response has been steadily increasing within the last years... Inactivated vaccines* are generally safe in subjects with underlying immunosuppression...Incontrast, live vaccines** such as yellow fever, measles, rubella, herpes zoster and may lead to severe reactions in immunocompromised patients(187)\" *inactivated vaccines are made from killed virus strains which are incapable of secondary transmission or reproduction after immunization(189). **live vaccines use living but attenuated (weakened) virus which can theoretically be re-transmitted after immunization, and can reproduce in both a primary and secondary host(189). Measles vaccines are currently made of live attenuated viruses(188). According to the American Academy Of Allergy Asthma & Immunology: quote: \"The live vaccines should not be given to patients with immune deficiencies\". \"Also, family members or household contacts should not receive live vaccines, as they may transmit the live virus to the immune deficient family member.\"(175) In an apparent contradiction to this statement however, is the CDC (Center For Disease Control, USA) document \"Vaccine Recommendations and Guidelines Of The ACIP, Altered Immunocompetence\" which states: quote:\"The live MMR, varicella and rotavirus vaccines should be administered to susceptible household contacts and other close contacts of immuno- compromised patients when indicated.\"(174) This CDC document then rejoins the conclusions of the American Academy Of Allergy Asthma & Immunology, by stating: quote:\"...persons who have altered immunocompetence and receive live vaccines might be at increased risk for an adverse reaction because of uninhibited growth of the attenuated live virus or bacteria.\"(174) Experimental studies have demonstrated that live vaccine recipients are theoretically capable of secondary viral transmission: study one: 345 individuals, ages 5 - 49 years, were vaccinated with live influenza virus. 30 percent of these individuals produced live virus when nasal swabs were sampled(190). study two: 200 children, ages 6 - 69 months were vaccinated with live influenza virus. 79% of these children were positive for viral shedding(190). Prior to the 1970's, measles immunization involved inactivated virus, after which there was a switch to live attenuated measles (191)(196). This change coincided historically over a half century, with a 30 fold increase in autism cases(192). Present medical opinion states that there is no relationship between the dramatic increase in autism cases, and this switch(191).* *author's note: It is argued in published scientific literature, that repeated broadening and manipulation of the diagnostic criteria for autism over the last 5 decades, produced a misleading impression that autism cases have increased dramatically(194). Within the United States, the incidence of autism varies widely state by state, region by region, over time, and again, by the statistical formulae and criterial definitions used(195). quote: \"...no formal changes in diagnostic criteria were introduced or adopted between the years 2000 and 2012. Thus, changes in the prevalence of ASD (autistic Spectrum Disorder) during this period cannot be readily explained by the evolution of diagnostic criteria.\"(193) - Prevalence Of Autism Spectrum Disorder- Mental Disorders and Disabilities Among Low Income Children. National Academies Press, 2015(193) . sub-discussion point 1: Measles Virus Reproduction When vaccine shedding occurs, an extremely small quantity of virus is introduced into the secondary host via aerosol or indirect contact (as opposed to a vaccine bolus injection). The relatively small quantity of attenuated measles virus introduced into the secondary host would be quantitatively insufficent to produce the theoretical mechanism suggested here. Additional mechanisms are required for proliferation of live attenuated measles virus within the secondary host. Stated briefly, the attenuated measles virus reproduces in the host cell by first attaching to cell membrane receptors via viral H and F proteins on the surface of the measles virus envelope. Fusion of the viral envelope and host cell membrane can then occur, with release of the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm. The measles virus genome then undergoes both replication and transcription. The viral RNA is transcribed into messenger RNA which is then translated into viral proteins using the translation mechanisms of the host cell. The viral genome is duplicated multiple times via RNA transcriptase. New viral particles are created from the conjoined replicated measles proteins and genomic material. Infective virus can relocate to other host cells by direct cell to cell contact, or by migration to other cells via release into intercellular fluids(177)(178)(179). It is theorized here, that attenuated measles virus shed by either a healthy or immune compromised primary host, can infect and extensively proliferate within the secretory IgA deficient secondary host. Normal secretory IgA levels enable the clearance of the attenuated measles virus as it undergoes limited reproduction, and the immune system becomes primed against measles infection(53). There is some proof of this conjecture. In a study performed by A A J M Van de Ven and W J M Janssen, etal in the Journal Of Clinical Immunology August 2014 34(8): 54 IgA deficient pediatric patients were compared to 66 healthy (i.e IgA normal) pediatric patients for gastrointestinal viruses. Of the IgA deficient children, 24% tested positive for gastrointestinal viruses, versus 9% of the healthy controls(197). quote: \"These findings suggest that particularly patients with low IgA are at risk for long standing replication of gastrointestinal viruses(197).\" Measles virus has been detected in the gastrointestinal tract of vaccinated and non-vaccinated autistic children. In one study conducted by Singh and Jensen, 83% of autistic children were found to have elevated levels of non-IgA antibodies to measles(181). This was (in this study) regardless of whether the autistic child was immunized or not, the age at which they were tested, or how soon after the diagnosis was made(181). Other studies in contrast, have shown normal levels of non-IgA antibodies to measles in autistic children(200)(203). These counter observations are theoretically explainable via the capability of measles with time, to achieve latency and avoid immune activation via direct cell to cell contact and transmission(167). It has been demonstrated experimentally, that if measles becomes a persistant infection, the N protein levels remain, while other measles protein decline(201).Along with the theorized role of attenuated measles N protein, that of interference with immune/enzyme modulation, it can also reduce body fluid related viral transmission, which can reduce measles virus detection(167). According to Doi, Kwon, Honda, etal. ScientificReports,www.nature.com/scientificreports: summary quote: \"Our analysis of viral protein dynamics shows that during the establishment of persistant infection, the nucleoprotein (N protein) level was sustained while the phosphoprotein ( P protein) large protein (L protein) levels declined. The ectopic expression of nucleoprotein suppressed viral replication, indicating that viral replication is self-regulated by nucleo- protein accumulation during persistent infection(201).\" And further stated by Rota, Moss, Takeda etal in Nature Reviews 2016: quote: \"Virus dissemination within the host is primarily mediated by direct cell-to-cell transmission of the virus via infectious synapses.(167)\" Many of these contrasting studies showing normal non-IgA immunoglobulin levels relative to measles, also erroneously collate their data with no regard to subject age(202). Subjects of some large studies, can range in age from a few months old to their early twenties(202). The immune system changes with time, maturation, and response to immunological challenge(204)(205). This can produce change in any viral activity within the host(206). It is imperative that all data and conclusions in autism studies, be presented in an age stratified manner. The end result theoretically, would be reproduction of the attenuated measles virus in the secondary secIgA deficient host, with it's associated measles N protein, to levels similar to that of the vaccinated primary host child. As is the case in the vaccinated IgA defficient child, there would be no classic measles symptoms. The secIgA deficiency and other CMD's, would also allow for the initiation factor interference previously mentioned. Thus if autism could theoretically result from immunization with the attenuated measles virus, then it could also theoretically result from the secondary exposure from another immunized child. The logical question now is: Is there any evidence to support this theory? The answer is conditional. The \"condition\" refers to a a re-interpretation of existing published experimental data and conclusions. sub-discussion point 2: Re-Interpretation Of Published Data In Regard To Autism It has become well accepted by most autism researchers (this author included) that autism can have predisposing genetic factors. It is also believed that autism has environmental factors. Many of these conditions have been previously listed in this paper. Both genetic factors and environmental factors are also shared by individuals within the same family. These observations in conjunction with statistical analysis, has led to the conclusion that autism is genetic and/or environmental in nature(66)(67) (96)(104)(105). It has been theorized in this paper, that the crucial genetic factor for autism, is critically low secretory IgA coupled with other genetic factors/congenital metabolic disorders. These plus secondary immune suppressive infections, could theoretically produce the required intracellular conditions to cause the reduced steric hindrance implicated in autism. The theoretical environmental factor, also reducing steric hindrance and supplying the initiation factor interfering N protein would be the attenuated measles virus. Thus, the concepts offered in this paper can be used to combine both competing theories into one single testable unified theory. abstract quote: \"We previously proposed that changes in the efficiency of protein translation are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD's). This hypothesis connects environ- mental factors and genetic factors because each can alter translation efficiency.\" - Rogozin I, Gertz Statistical Data: 88% chance that an identical twin of an autistic child will also have autism(209) 31% chance that a fraternal twin of an autistic child will also have autism(210) 3% - 10% chance of a second younger sibling being autistic(208)(236) 2.27% (year 2018) of all U.S. children are autistic(207) 83% of tested autistic children were found to display measles antibody to a specific 74 kd (molecular weight) measles protein.(181). Though born at the same time, fraternal twins are as genetically similar as separately born siblings(211). The fact that their autism rates are significantly higher, implicates a non-genetic component to autism. In contrast, coincident autism rates in identical twins are significantly below 100%. If autism were purely genetic, one would expect a nearly unanimous response for identical twins with little variability. Basic genetics demands that genes alone cannot cause autism. The explosive increase in autism diagnosis over the last fifty years, previously noted, would require a massive amount of interbreeding among individuals who possess many of the implicated genes. This simply has not occurred. Genetic diseases are not contageous, and can only increase drastically when many carrier individuals breed and produce many more carrier individuals over many generations. The previously stated view that the \"explosive\" increase in autism cases may be due to repeated changes in diagnostic criteria for autism, would also paradoxically refute genetics as a sole cause(194). As noted, 83% of tested autistic children were found to have measles immunoglobulins(181). Approximately half of all infants who become autistic are not immunized first(212)(236). According to published research, there are only four ways that an infant can have antibodies to measles(213)(214)(215)(216): 1. immunization with attentuated measles vaccine 2. exposure to infectous natural measles 3. umbilicus transfer of the virus and/or antibody 4. direct injection of antibody(immunoglobulins) The key point here, is that if an autistic child has measles antibodies and does not fit into any of the above criteria, then the only explanation remaining is the transfer of attenuated measles virus from a primary to the secondary host. The result is production of measles antibody. The tests for this theory are similar to those put forth previously for immunized autistic children. First, by highly cauteous administration of attenuated measles N protein specific secretory IgA to the non-immunized autistic child, a positive result should be elicited. Second, attenuated measles N protein specific secretory IgA administered to a susceptible child for an unspecified time period, should offer protection from another child shedding attenuated measles virus. Third, immunization of the mother with measles vaccine, with long term concurrent breast feeding, should also protect the non-immunized child. Lastly, a universal changeover to immunization with innactivated measles virus, rather than the live attenuated form, could result in a large reduction in cases of autism in both immunized and non-immunized children. Lastly, routine testing for, and treatment of, any form of secretory immunoglobulin A defficiency in infants could theoretically avoid the incidence of measles N protein related autism in susceptable unvacinated as well as vaccinated infants. If the theory presented and explained in this paper is correct, a measles vaccination would thus not be required to contribute to autism. The attenuated measles virus from a vaccinated child could theoretically infect a susceptible child and contribute to autism. As previously mentioned, the other \"elephant\" in the room, the healthy infant with normal secretory IgA levels, no congenital metabolic diseases, and no secondary infections, who is immunized with attenuated measles vaccine according to this theory, should never become autistic. This should theoretically remain true even if another immunized or non- imunized sibling becomes autistic. They can also be exposed to secondary transfer of live attenuated virus from an immunized host, with no effect. Authors Note: Children Who Become Autistic (vaccinated or not) But Improve With Time It is important to note that occassionally, children diagnosed with autism (especially a mild case) will gradually improve to a limited extent(216). It is theoretically possible that a transitory form of secretory immunoglobulin A deficiency may play a role in this. Transient serum immunoglobulin A deficiency, has been clinically identified in some infants(122). Negative health and chacteristic behaviors tend to diminish if serum IgA levels normalize with age(218). Diminishing levels of autistic behaviors and mannerisms, are often used as examples of successful treatments by speech or behavioral therapists. Therapies of this nature however, can neither explain nor prevent the occurance of autistic regression, which can sometimes follow the appearance of symptom improvement(219). Discussion Five: The Attenuated Measles Virus A complete list of all changes to the measles virus after the attenuation process, and continued reproduction in a host, does not exist at this time(220)(221)(237). There is evidence however, that changes do occur. For example, back mutation to virulent wild type measles virus form has been detected in immune deficient children previously inoculated with the attenuated form(220)(238). When cells persistantly infected with measles are tested for measles proteins, changes in immunoprecipitation patterns are observed(222). These changes can signify conformational changes in the structure of measles proteins, which can reflect on changes in the amino acid sequencing and the properties of the measles proteins in vivo*(223). *Viruses can reproduce in vitro, in which they are grown in living cells contained in a dish or tube as opposed to in vivo growth, in which the virus grows in cells within a living host(225). Historically, the measles virus attenuation process began with wild type measles virus derived from David Edmonston, a child who had contracted measles(188). The recovered virus was grown in human renal cells, amnion cells, and chick embryo fibroblasts. Further attenuation was conducted by passage through additional chick embryo fibroblasts to achieve modern levels of attenuation or weakening of the virus(168)(226). When injected into a living human host, the weakened virus would then produce immunity, without causing an active measles infection(188). The previously mentioned theoretical mechanism involving steric hindrance/messenger-metabolite flux reduction, offers an explanation of HOW atenuated measles N protein gets to the initiation site, but does not fully explain WHY it would continue to do so, and not resume its primary role in the construction of new virus particles via formation of the nucleocapsid(227). The measles N protein is made up of two sections, a conserved N core of 405 amino acids and a disordered terminal N tail of 120 amino acids(228). Theoretically, it is the randomly ordered portion of the N protein tail that interferes with the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3-p40 which bridges with eIF4E via an eIF4G linkage(47) (48)(49). This theoretically produces a metabolic/immune homeostatic imbalance (and autism). It would thus be reason- able to conjecture that this randomly ordered series of connected amino acids would be vulnerable to alteration and change in its binding properties after the attenuation process and repeated in vivo viral reproduction. HOWEVER, published research appears to indicate that this may not be the case. It has been experimently demonstrated, that the attenuation process of the measles virus will, in the P protein, in all measles vaccines, remove a glutamic acid (amino acid), and replace it with a glycine (amino acid)(231).* *author's note: Even a single amino acid change in a bioactive protein can create chaos in a living system. For example, the hemoglobulin molecule in blood, is made up of 2 alpha and 2 beta globin chains totaling 574 amino acids. When one amino amino acid in the beta chains, valine, is substituted for the amino acid glutamic acid, functional and physical changes occur in red blood cells. This results in the classic \"sickle-like\" RBC's appearance, and the disease sickle cell anemia(230). The consistant change in measles virus P protein after attenuation, can change its relationship with the attenuated N protein, resulting in changes in the intracellular behavior of the attenuated measles N protein(227). According to B, etal quote: \"Adaption of a wild-type MeV (measles virus) to cell culture selected for genetic changes that caused measurable functional differences in viral proteins.\"(223) And according to Parks C, Lerch R, etal in the Journal Of Virology (Jan. 2001): quote: \"The N protein is essential for packaging the genome into a ribonucleoprotein complex that serves as a template for transcription, replication, and packaging into progeny virions.\"(227) quote: \"P protein also acts as a chaperone that interacts with and regulates the cellular localization of N protein and probably assists in nucleocapsid assembly.\"(227) quote: \"substitutions in P protein are likely to significantly impact viral replication efficiency.\"(227) This clear and consistant change in the measles virus P protein after attenuation, can theoretically explain \"WHY\" there is a continued presence of the attenuated measles N protein at the eIF3-p40 initiation site. Secretory IgA deficiency would then theoretically prevent measles N protein clearance and elimination. Therefore, it can be theorized that if N protein is synthesized and not used to form ribonucleprotein complexes leading to the manufacture of entire virus particles, then more N protein is consistantly available for long term interference at the eIF3-p40 eukaryotic initiation site. author's note: As part of the measles virus attenuation process, changes to the measles N protein tail amino acid sequences also consistantly occur. However, these changes are both inconsistant, and vary with immunization strain(231). Discussion Six: Relevent Issues Concerning This Theory As noted, a logical sequence of events has been suggested for the genesis of autism associated with attenuated measles virus/vaccine. However, the sharp-eyed reader may have noted two specific references cited in which autistic-like behaviors have been observed in which NO MEASLES VIRUS WAS PRESENT: (18)Prenatal and Early-Life Diesel Exhaust Exposure Causes Autism-Like Behavior Changes In Mice Chang YL, Cole TB, Costa L Part Fibre Toxicol. 2018 Apr 20;15(1):18 (46)Exaggerated Translation causes Synaptic and Aberrations Associated With Autism. Santini E, Huynh T, etal. Nature 2013 Jan 17;493(7432) :411 - 415 It may be theoretically possible that there are other causes of homeostatic dysregulation between the Th1/Th2 immune and phase1/ phase2 enzyme systems. The eIf3P40 initiation site could be dysregulated by other vectors besides the measles N protein, resulting in autism. Genetic errors involving the initiation sites themselves are also possible. Theoretically, multiple errors of metabolism and risk factors together, without attenuated measles, could overwhelm homeostatic regulation via multiple initiation sites, etc. The theory that severe continuing intracellular homeostatic dysregulation results in autism, however, could still remain a viable concept. The reader may also inquire how on the one hand, the explosive reproduction of attenuated measles virus in a non-vaccinated child can theoretically produce autism, while on the other hand, reduced attenuated viral reproduction (via diversion of the N protein) in a vaccinated child, may also theoretically produce autism. This issue is resolved in two ways. First, by the different reproductive and infective properties of the attenuated measles virus versus wild type measles, and second, by the varied behavior of the attenuated measles virus itself in different cell types. The attenuated measles virus, has three modes of entry into cells (not including direct cell-to-cell infection), the CD46, CD150, and Nectin-4 receptors. Theses three receptors are located on various cell surfaces. Wild type measles virus in contrast, has two, the CD150 and Nectin-4 for initial cell entry(224)(235).* *note: This is the second consistant change in all measles virus vaccines that occurs after the attenuation process(229). Having different modes of cell entry promotes different infective and reproduction rates in different cell types for wild and attenuated measles virus(232). For example, vaccine strains infect T lymphocytes more efficiently then do wild type measles virus. Wild type measles virus infects macrophages and NK cell with a higher efficiency then vaccine strains(232)(188). The attenuated measles vaccine itself infects different cell types to a different extent(233). The three modes of cell entry (not including direct cell to cell transfer), would theoretically, enhance the opportunity for rapid proliferation and growth in some cell types, with less growth in other types of infected cells. For example, the attenuated measles virus proliferates better in respiratory cells, endothelial cells and monocyte derived cells, then in lymphoid cells(188)(237). Theoretically, cells which play a stronger role in immune/metabolic homeostasis via the eIF3-p40 initiation site linkage (and consequently removing the measles N protein from its reproductive role), should have higher levels of attenuated measlesvirus inhibition. Other cells with less involvement in immune/ metabolic homeostasis (and more available attenuated measles N protein), could have less inhibition, and produce higher levels of attenuated measles virus. These more infective cells, in conjunction with low or non-existant secretory IgA, would enhance viral reproduction and spread of the attenuated measles virus to other cells via the additional cell entry port. By employing this theoretical arguement, the paradox of attenuated measles virus inhibition ocurring in some cells while reproductive enhancement occurs in others, can be resolved. Given the laborious effort of this paper to construct a theoretical relationship between attenuated measles vaccine and autism, would withdrawal of measles vaccine reduce autism? In a 1996 study, Yokahama, Japan experienced a major decline in measles vaccination rates for children born between 1988 and 1992. During approximately the same time period (1988 - 1996), autistic spectrum disorder rates continued to increase. It is theoretically possible that the combination of the multiple changes in diagnostic criteria, coupled with the stated transmissability of the attenuated measles virus to susceptible children, might with further study, account for this discrepancy(234). History: At birth, approximately 3 weeks early, Teenager X exhibited an olive green skin tone, diagnosed as hyperbilirubinemia, a condition in which large amounts of biliverdin (the oxidative product of bilirubin) build up in the skin tissue, producing a greenish skin color. This condition persisted for nearly two years. This impairment can reflect apon a developmental failure to produce the phase II enzyme(s) to clear excess billirubin, or deficencies in the homeostatic mechanism that controls production of these enzymes(69). As stated by Cayabyab R and Raymanathan R in Pediatr Res (2019): quote: \"Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most frequent diagnoses made in neonates. A high level of unconjugated bilirubin that is unbound to albumin is neurotoxic when the level exceeds age-specific thresholds or at lower levels in neonates with neurotoxic risk factors.\" (123) quote:\"Severe hyperbilirubinemia in term neonates has been shown to be associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorders.\" (123) Prior to immunization, teenager X, as an infant, was exposed to large quantities of fungal elements as a result of home remodeling as well as cessation of breast feeding which normally can provide large quantities of secretory IgA(154) (155)(156). note: At this point, we have a potential reduction in various enzyme and immune flux systems from premature birth, reduction in flux as a result of hyperbilrubinemia, and reduced maternal and intrinsic secretory IgA levels. All prior to measles immunization. As stated by Hayes JA, Adamson-Macedo En, preterm neonate has multiple immune deficiencies which may increase his or her vulnerability to infection.\"(125) quote:\"neonates who were receiving expressed breast milk had significantly higher concentrations of SIgA (secretory IgA)\" (125) With the exception of the hyperbilirubinemia, The infant X prior to MMR immunization was normal in all respects. Healthy, alert, responsive in all ways appropriate to a five month old at the time of immunization*. *Special note here. Infant X was immunized with MMR vaccine at 5 months of age. This NOT the presently reccomended time for immunization. Initial immunization of infants with MMR is usually scheduled at 12 months of age. According to Hooker B, and Miller N in \"Analysis Of Health Outcomes In Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Children: Deveopmental Delays, Asthma, Ear Infections and Gastrointestinal Disorders: abstract quote: \"Vaccination before 1 year of age was associated with increased odds of developmental delays...\"(180) Several hours after immunization, a moderate fever along with a shrill abnormal crying pattern never heard before, continued throughout the evening. By morning, evidence of abnormality was apparent. Visual and auditory focus was severely impaired. Attentiveness to parents was diminished to the point of the appearing deaf. Facial expressions were dramatically altered. Within a week, all the classic autistic features and behaviors were manifest. Within days of MMR immunization, Infant X began manifesting severe candida infections on the buttocks and oral candidosis, with uncontrollable laughter, diminished pain sensation and inability to sleep. It was observed that the greater the apparent severity of the Candida infection, the greater the symptom severity. After consultation with the child's pediatrician, a topical antifungal was prescribed. This greatly reduced the behaviors, though autistic mannerisms persisted. When infant X appeared \"cured\" of the Candida infection and topical antifungal application ceased, a new candida infection started up again days later with resumption of behaviors. When an oral antifungal was prescribed, behaviors again improved, but again, cessation of treatment resulted in reemergence of the candida infection and behaviors. Long term control of the Candida infections during infancy and early childhood, was only achieved with the use of Transfer Factor specific to Candida(71)(86) and dosage with diphenhydramine to treat high histamine levels. This temporary stability of the autistic condition lasted until puberty. CONCLUSION: Many theories concerning the cause of autism exist. All these theories unfortunately share one thing in common: They tend to ignore well established facts about autism that lie outside the author's area of expertise. The theory presented in this paper, if correct, would hopefully enable many of the facts and observations concerning autism to be unified in a clear and reasonable manner. The hypothesis that measles vaccination is involved in the development of autism has been disputed by numerous statistical studies. At present, any attempt to revive such a view, would elicit strong scepticism, if not outright contempt. The evidence of teenager X presented here, the many responsible research articles cited, and the research backed theory put forth, clearly indicates that if there is an involvement between measles and autism, it is not simple or obvious. It is a well known fact that a given pathogen does not produce the same disease state for everyone. In the age of covid-19, it is evident that a given pathogen can kill one infected individual, while leaving another an asymptomatic carrier. Predisposing conditions clearly play a significant role in the manifestation of a disease. It is well documented, that not all children vaccinated with the same vaccine will respond in the same way(88)(89)(92). Thankfully, the vast majority of children will, but not all. It is the moral and ethical responsibility of researchers to study and weigh in on these documented exceptions with open and enquiring minds: quote: \"when live vaccines are given, significant vaccine-related adverse events can occur, including the emergence of disease from vaccine strains.\" summary quote, Vaccine 2014 Principi and Esposito (88) quote: \"Adverse effects of vaccines have been recognized for many years, especially the occurrence of infections caused by viable vaccine organisms in immunodeficient hosts.\" summary quote, Allergy Clin Immunol. 2018 Bonilla FA (92) Confronted in this paper as well, are the so called \"elephants\" in the room; childen who became autistic without vaccination, and those children vaccinated who remain normal. The theory proposed here, if correct, states that under certain circumstances, the attenuated measles virus behaves as a highly contagious novel pathogenic variant of the wild type measles virus. Theoretically, secondary transmission from an immunized child to a susceptible (without significant secretory IgA) infant would not produce classic measles, but autism. The suggested prevention and treatment would remain the same, with the caveat that susceptible infants must be isolated from contact with immunized children and other vectors of transmission, until their levels of secretory IgA are normalized. What is unique about the theory presented in this paper, is that it offers multiple tests of the theoretical concept. If an individual with the same characteristics as autistic Teenager X is treated successfully with human derived attenuated measles N protein specific secIgA, then the theory is proven. A second related test would be that measles N protein specific IgA be administered along with the measles vaccine to a statistically significant number of children. If this theory is correct, and the dosage regime accurate, then this addendum to the measles vaccine, could produce a significant reduction in the overall number of new autism cases. It could theoretically allow for safe and effective live vaccine immunization against measles. A third related test of theory would require the MMR immunization of the mother prior to birth or just after. Immunization of the infant should occur coincident to breastfeeding (before, during and after immunization) The infant would theoretically receive sufficient measles specific secretory IgA via breast milk (please see quotes below). Given a statistically significant test group, there should be a reduction in autism cases. As stated by Maertens, De Schutter, etal. in Vaccine(2014): quote:\"Vaccination during pregnancy results in an augmentation of disease specific maternal antibodies... secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA) is passed through breast milk.\"(126) And previously stated and verified by Prentice A in Archives Of Diseases In Childhood(1987): quote:\"The concentrations and outputs of secretory IgA in urine were significvantly higher in the breast fed group by a factor of three\"(133) Based apon the observations of Teenager X, published research, and pending experimental proof, it is theorized that severely subnormal secretory IgA coupled with one or more additional risk factors or CMD's, measles vaccination, and secondary opportunistic infections, results in a critical messenger- metabolite flux (steric hindrance) reduction. This allows the opportunity for the attenuated measle N protein to interfer with immune/metabolic homeostasis via a specific eukaryotic initiation factor. Reduced secretory IgA and other immune suppressions, perpetuates an attenuated measles virus latency. The continuing homeostatic interference results in autism. Experimental proof remains pending. Immunization with MMR vaccine does not directly cause autism. Immunization with MMR vaccine saves thousands of lives every year. For the universal benefit of the public, MMR vaccination is neccessary. It is the responsibility of medical science however, to identify those children for whom intrinsic risk factors or CMD's (inclusive of abnormally low secretory IgA) coupled with the measles vaccine and secondary infection, could risk autism. Lastly and sadly, should any relationship between measles and autism be established, more children may become sickened then will be restored to normalacy. As parents become aware, many will refuse to immunize, resulting in vast increases in measles cases. This would present a severe challenge to public health services in the neccessary and critical promotion of immunization. Special thanks to the late Dr Hugh H Fudenburg whose trailblazing work involving Candida, Transfer Factor and Autism had a deep impact on me, and kept my research pointed in the right direction. author's request. There are strong opinions on the subject of autism and measles. Feedback on suggested theories is vital to scientific progress. If you the reader, posessing an MD or PHD, would be kind enough to offer your thoughts on this work, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time and effort to read through this paper.
