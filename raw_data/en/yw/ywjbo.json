It focuses on the information coming in through the neurology and the programs we run inside our heads to produce the behaviors we do. NLP therapy incorporates NLP, a set of language- and sensory-based interventions and behavior-modification techniques designed to help improve the client's self-awareness, confidence, communication skills, and social actions. The goals of NLP are to help the client understand that the way one views the world affects how one operates in the world, and that it is necessary to change the thoughts and behavior patterns that have not proven beneficial in the past and that only serve to block one's healing and success. - Neuro - Refers to the mind and brain. This is your mind and body state, which greatly affects your behaviors and communication. - Linguistic - Our mind and body states are revealed in our language and non-verbal communication. - Programming - Refers to the capacity to change our mind and body states. We are living according to our programming, which refers to habitual feelings, thoughts, behaviors, traditions, and reactions. Emotion Freedom Technique EFT, also known as tapping, is powerful holistic healing technique that can resolve a range of issues, including stress, anxiety, phobias, emotional disorders, chronic pain, addiction, weight control, and limiting beliefs. It increases mind-body connection, acknowledging and integrating the concepts that physical pain, disease, and mental wellbeing are intricately connected to our emotional states. Tapping therapy is a combination of ancient Chinese acupressure principles and modern psychology. Tapping with the fingertips on specific meridian endpoints of the body, while focusing on negative emotions or physical sensations, helps to calm the nervous system, rewire the brain to respond in healthier ways, and restore the body's balance of energy. The body is equipped with an energy system that travels along pathways known as meridians. Tapping on these meridian endpoints helps to stimulate this system, and when verbally or mentally addressing the root causes of distress, the areas of blocked energy are able to release and flow naturally. The purpose is to \"turn off\" the amygdala, part of the brain responsible for fight or flight, disrupting the stress response and allowing the brain synapses to be rewired for a more appropriate emotional response to a given situation. The basic Tapping technique requires you to focus on the negative emotion at hand - a fear, a worry, a bad memory, an unresolved problem, or anything that's bothering you. Tapping on these meridian points in sequence while concentrating on the negative emotions engages both the brain's limbic system and the body's energy system, encouraging a sense of safety and resolution. When you change your internal environment - your emotions and beliefs - external changes in your mental & physical health will follow. T.I.M.E. Technique Stands for Time Integration for Maximum Empowerment. It is one of the most powerful set of NLP techniques to instantly eliminate all negative emotions, release limiting beliefs, undo past decisions, banish the effects of phobias and completely eliminate the emotions of guilt and anxiety. It is a process of active imagination where the client imagines floating above his/her timeline and letting go of emotion or limiting decision (or limiting belief). Then the client is asked to imagine creating events in his/her future that support goals and outcomes. Hypnotherapy Hypnosis is done in order to access the subconscious mind. This trance-like state is similar to being completely absorbed in a book, movie, music, or even one's own thoughts or meditations. In this state, clients can turn their attention completely inward to find and utilize the natural resources deep within themselves that can help them make changes or regain control in certain areas of their life. Performed in a calm and therapeutic environment, the hypnotherapist will guide you into a relaxed, focused state and ask you to think about experiences and situations in positive ways that can help you change the way you think and behave. Unlike some dramatic portrayals of hypnosis in movies, books, or on stage, you will not be unconscious, asleep, or in any way out of control of yourself. You will hear the therapist's suggestions, but it is up to you to decide whether or not to act on them. Muscle Testing using Emotion Code Muscle testing can be used to tap into the subconscious mind in order to answer questions about physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. It's a noninvasive method designed to determine the potential underlying causes of ailments and discomfort \u2014 everything from nutritional needs to trapped Emotions. If the body tests positive for a trapped emotion, the Practitioner works with the client to uncover specific qualities about the emotion, such as when it originated and how, with the goal of releasing the newly resolved emotion from the body's energy field.
