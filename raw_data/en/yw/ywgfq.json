Implementation Plan for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals1 Preamble The United Nations Sustainable Development Summit was successfully held in September 2015 . The Summit adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which points out the direction and provides the blueprint f o r national development of all countries and international development cooperation in the next 15 years. Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the central task in the international development endeavor . While facing a sluggish world economic recovery, widening development gap between the North and the South, the international community is also confronted with challenges like refugee crisis, terrorism, public health threats and the climate change. All countries should work together to match words with deeds and translate commitment in to reality by earnestly implementing the 2030 Agenda , jointly embarking on the path of equitable, open, all-round, innovation-driven and sustainable development and improving the well-being of mankind. As the largest developing country in the world, China has always given top priority to development . China attache s great importance to the 2030 Agenda. The 13th Five-Year Plan was reviewed and approved by the Fourth Session of the 12th National People ' s Congress in March 2016 , linking the 2030 Agenda with domestic mid-and-long term development strategies. Right now, implementation of the 2030 Agenda is in full swing in China . To guide and advance the implementation efforts, China formulates this C hina ' s National Plan on Implementation of t he 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ( hereinafter referred to as National Plan ) . Drawing on the achievements and experience of China ' s development, the National Plan analyzes challenges and opportunities in implementing the 2030 agenda, lays out the guiding thoughts, general principles and approaches for the implementation , a s well as specific plans for the implementation of the 17 S ustainable D evelopment G oals (SDG) and 169 targets. The National Plan will be update d in light of the developments in due course . In the coming years, China will earnestly fulfill the tasks in the National Plan under the guid ance of the people-centred development concept featuring innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development . It will work with other countries in seeking mutual benefit, win-win cooperation and common development and make unremitting2 efforts for the implementation of the 2030 A genda and realization of the dreams of people across the world.3 I. Achievements and Experience in China ' s Implementation of the Millennium Development Goals 1. Major A chievements The T hird P lenary S ession of the 11th the Communist Party of China( CPC ) Central Committee in December 1978 opened a new historic period of reform and opening-up, which was a monumental strategic choice that has shaped contemporary China, an inexhaustible source of vitality for national development and progress , and the only path toward socialism with Chinese characteristics and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation . Reform and opening-up has t ransform ed China from a highly centrally - planned economy to a dynamic socialist market economy and from a closed or semi-closed society to an all-round open society . China ' s comprehensive national strength has reached a new level and its people are generally liv ing in a moderately well-off society . During the great endeavor of reform and opening-up , China has made remarkable progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in the first 15 years of the new century. \u2014 With its fast growing economy and outstanding achievements in ag ricultur e and poverty reduction , China ' s Gross Domestic Product( GDP ) had increased from RMB 1 0 tr illion in 2000 to 68.55 tr illion in 2015, making it the second largest economy in the world since 2010. Production of m ajor agricultural products such as grains, vegetables and meat gr e w steadily with enhanced comprehensive agricultural productivity. China ' s population living in poverty dropped from 689 million in 1990 to 57 million in 2015 , making a great contribution to the global cause of poverty reduction. \u2014 Tremendous social progress has been achieved. The nine-year f ree compulsory education has been universalized and illiteracy rate had dropped from 6.7 % in 2000 to 4.1 % in 2014. Steady job growth had been achieved with altogether 137 million new jobs created in urban areas from 2003 to 2014. Under the leadership of the government and with the participation of social sectors, China has gradually developed a comprehensive social security and assistance system. By 2015, more than 500 million urban and rural residents had been covered by basic pension insurance. The under-five child mortality rate went down from 61.0 per thousand in 1991 to 1 0 . 7 per thousand in 2015 , and the maternal mortality rate had reduce d from 88.8 per 100,000 in 1990 to 20.1 per 100,000 in 2015. Notable progress has been made in curbing epidemic diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.4 \u2014 Positive results have been achieved in terms of environmental protection and addressing the climate change. C ompared with that of 2005 , China ' s carbon dioxide emission per GDP unit decreased by 33.8% in 2014; the proportion of non-fossil fuels in overall primary energy use had reached 11.2%; per GDP unit consumption of major resource products like oil , coal and water had also been cut dramatically ; f orest coverage ha d expanded by 32.78 million hectares , and forest reserves ha d increased by 2 . 681 b illion cubic meters from that of 2005, achieving \" zero growth \" in land desertification ahead of schedule. \u2014 South-South cooperation has been promoted. China offers assistance within it s ca pacity to over 120 developing countries to help them achieve the MDGs. Since 1 January 2015, China has officially granted zero-tariff treatment to 97% of the tax able item s from least developed countries with diplomatic relations with China . China has , for six times , cancel led unconditionally the due government zero-interest loans totaling RMB 30 billion for heavily indebted poor countries and least developed countries. 2. Development E xperience China ' s experience in achieving the MDGs can be summed up as follows: ----T aking development as the top priority and consistently introducing new development thoughts and concept s. The Chinese government considers development as the key to address all major issues of the country. In light of the domestic and international conditions, t he Chinese government and people have deepen ed their understanding of the nature of development , developed the Scientific Outlook on Development, set the ambitious goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and firmly established the development concept featuring innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development . China ha s made the overall plan s of building socialism with Chinese characteristic s and promoting all-round economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological progress . ----Fo rmulating and implementing mid- and long-term national development strategies and integrating the MDGs into national planning. The Chinese government formulates five-year national plans according to the needs of economic and social development in different periods and mobilizes all kinds of resources for the implementation of these plans. In addition, China has also made a range of specific plans to effectively5 promote the development of relevant sectors, including the Outline for Development-oriented Poverty Reduction for China ' s Rural Areas (2011-2020) , Outline on Mid-and-Long-Term Food Security in China (2008-2020) , Outline on Mid-and-Long-Term Educational Reform and Development Plan in China (2010-2020) , and Twelfth Five-Year Plan for Health Sector Development . ----L etting the market play its due role and properly handling the relationship between the government and the market. The socialist market economy has inspired the vitality in labor, knowledge, technology, managerial expertise and capital, propell ed the sustained , rapid and sound growth of the Chinese economy and provid ed guarantee for the implementation of the MDGs. Regarding effective government administration as the intrinsic requirement for giving play to the advantages of the socialist market economy, China has deepened the reform of the administrative system, exercised government administration in an innovative way and buil t a law-based , innovative, clean and service-oriented government to make the fruits of development more fairly shared by all . ----S etting up a sound system of laws and regulations and mobiliz ing all sectors of the society. The Chinese government has successively promulgated or amended the Compulsory Education Law , the Law on Protection of Women ' s Rights and Interests, the Employment Promotion Law, the La bor Contract Law , and the En vironmental Protection Law to provide sound legal guarantee for the implementation of the MDGs. The government has also engaged all social actors in the implementation efforts through active guidance, multi -party cooperation, publicity and other means. At the same time, non-governmental groups are also involved in a bottom-up manner to achieve goals such as eradicating poverty and hunger and advancing environmental protection. ----L aunching pilot zones and experimental projects and promoting successful models nationwide incrementally. Pilot zones and experimental projects constitute an important institutional innovation in China ' s reform and opening-up process . To achieve MDGs and sustainable development , China has launched a series of experimental programs in economic , soci al and environmental protection fields. For example, it has set up the China(Shanghai) Pilot free trade zone , sustainable development experimental zones and 42 low-carbon pilot provinces, autonomous regions and cities, with the aim o f produc ing duplicable and scalable models for nation wide development .6 ----S trengthening international cooperation and promoting mutual exchange of development experience. The Chinese government has always implemented the MDGs with an open-minded and win-win attitude. Over the past 15 years, it has strengthened in-depth, wide-ranging and multi-form exchanges and cooperation with foreign government agencies, international organizations, business e s, research and consultative institutions and civil society organizations , in order to share experiences and lessons with each other and jointly promote the realization of the MDGs. China ' s MDG s achievement s ha ve not only advanced domestic development in an all-round way, but also made remarkable contribution to international development cooperation and global progress in MDGs. China ' s successful practices have boosted the Chinese government and people ' s confidence and determination in pursuit of socialism with Chinese characteristics and provided valuable experience for other developing countries to step up all-round development and find a development path suitable to their own national condition s. It has been widely acclaimed by the international community, especially other developing countries .7 II. Opportunities and Challenges in China ' s I mplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development As the world ' s largest developing country, China faces both rare opportunities and daunting challenges in implementing the 2030 Agenda. At the international level, peace and development remain the prevailing theme of our time. Greater interconnectivity and interdependence among countries ha ve reinforced the awareness of a community of shared destiny. We are now at the threshold of a new round of technological and industrial revolution s , when a large number of leading and disruptive new technologies, new tools and new materials emerge, giving a strong boost to the growth of new economy and upgrading of the traditional industries . The North-South cooperation and South-South cooperation have entered a new phase in which emerging economies like China grow rapidly in terms of overall national strength and influence in international affairs , presenting new opportunities for the developing world to fully participat e in global governance and international development cooperation. At the same time, international relations have become increasingly complicated with geopolitical factors getting more prominent , n on - traditional security threats such as refugee cris i s, terrorism and public health cris i s crop up one after another, casting a long shadow over the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The profound impact of the international financial crisis is still being felt and the world economy has a sluggish recovery with no strong new growth point s . As the WTO-led multilateral trade liberalization process remains deadlocked, trade and investment protectionism in various forms resurfaces. Moreover, the global governance system needs to be improved and the voice and representation of developing countries need to be enhanced. At the domestic level, the national governance capacity has been constantly strengthened in a stable political environment. T he 13th Five-Year Plan has introduced the people-centred concept of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development, providing the theoretical guidance for China ' s efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda and promote sustainable development . China ' s mid- to high-speed economic growth and advances in new industrialization, IT application, urbanization and agricultural modernization have laid a solid foundation for its continued progress in the implementation . The targeted supply-side structural reforms , intensified market reforms in the key links and major sectors , reforms in streamlining government functions and8 administration ,delegating power while improving regulation and upgrading government services can unleash tremendous reform and innovation dividends , which will provide a strong driving force for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the Chinese government has align ed its mid- and long - term development strategies with the 2030 Agenda and instituted a coordinating mechanism, providing a strong institutional guarantee for the implementation efforts. Meanwhile, as China ' s economy enters the new normal , it encounters multiple challenges like change of pace in economic growth, the difficulties associated with structural adjustments, and the transformation of the drivers of growth . F ac ing considerable pressure in maintain ing sustained, stable and healthy growth , China needs to do tremendous work in fighting poverty, narrow ing the urban-rural and regional development gap s and improving the ecological environment. The biggest challenges for China in realization of the 2030 Agenda remain the following: how to eradicate poverty, improve people ' s livelihood , defuse social problem s, achieve common prosperity, improve national governance system and capa bil ity , and achieve coordinated development among different regions , at all levels and in all fields .9 III.

T he Chinese government ' s vision of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development is consistent with sustainable development, which is the trend of the times , while accommodating the bigger interests of people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnerships as proposed by the 2030 Agenda . Based on China ' s national conditions and development experience, these concepts are China ' s contribution to the universal laws governing soci al and economic development and will guide China ' s efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda. 2. General P rinciples China adheres to following principles in its implementation efforts. \u2014 Principle of Peaceful Development.

Reaffirming that every country has full sovereignty over its own development and implementation of the 2030 Agenda, countries should be encouraged to formulate their domestic development strategies and take measures to implement the 2030 Agenda in accordance with their national conditions and respective characteristics. It is important to respect every country ' s choice for development path and draw on experience of each other. \u2014 Principle of \" Common but Differentiated Responsibilities \" . The implementation of the 2030 Agenda is a common objective, while the means of implementation should be allowed to be differentiated, due to diversified national conditions and respective capabilities, so that all countries would be able to make their own contributions to the global implementation process .12 IV. Overall Approaches for China ' s Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development China will advance the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in an incremental way through seven approaches , namely, synergy of strategies, institutional guarantee, social mobilization, resource input, risk management, international cooperation, and oversight and review . 1. Synergy of Strategies Synergy of s trategies aims at integrating the 2030 Agenda into China ' s mid-and-long term development strategies and creat ing synergy and complementarity between international agenda and domestic strateg ies . The focus in this synergy includes the following three aspects : First, i ntegrating the 17 SDG s and 169 targets into China ' s overall development planning and break down, incorporate, or link them the in special ized plan s . The Outline of the 13th Five-Year Plan contained a commitment to the \" active implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \" , thus achieving the synergy between the 2030 Agenda and China ' s mid-and-long term development strategies . Government departments of China ha ve turned the SDGs into specific tasks in the economic, social and environmental fields. In the economic field, for example, the Chinese government has formulated the National Outline for Innovation-Driven Development Strategy , the National Sustainable Agricultural Development Plan (2015-2030) , and the National Outline for Information Technology Development Strategy and . In the social field, it has published the Decision of the Communist Party of China(CPC) Central Committee and the State Council on Winning the Tough Battle in Poverty Reduction and the Healthy China Outline (2030) . In the environmental field, it has prepared the China Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Plan of Action (2011-2030) and the National Climate Change Program (2014-2020) . Second, b ringing the development objectives of local governments in line with the 2030 Agenda. Based on the Outline of the 13th Five-Year Plan, the 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government in China ' s mainland have formulated their own five-year plans, and the cities and counties have completed their road maps and annual plans. In this way, the central and local governments have created synergy for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.13 Third, p ushing multilateral mechanisms to formulate action plan for the 2030 Agenda to create synergy at international level . China played a leading role in urging the G20 to draw up action plan on implementation of the 2030 Agenda, while advancing the \" Belt and Road \" I nitiative in a way that will facilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in countries along the two routes , and supporting the efforts by regional commissions and specialized agencies of the United Nations to formulate actions plans for the goals and targets that fall within their respective regions or fields . 2. Institutional G uarantee Institutional guarantee refer s to the institutions , mechanisms and policies that will support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and it mainly include s the following four aspects : First, p romoting targeted reforms to establish an institutional framework for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Guided by the overarching goal of advancing socialism with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of the national governance system and capacity, the Chinese government will step up the improve ment of institution s and systems to ensure that the market plays the decisive role in resource allocation and the government better plays its role , and remove all institutional barrier s to scientific development, so as to provide institutional impetus for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. China will also a dvance the construction of innovation demonstration zones for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to accumulate best practices. Second, i mproving the rule of law to provide legal guarantee for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. China will step up the legislative work to improve the socialist market economic system, develop socialist democratic political system , foster advanced socialist culture, innovat e on social governance, safeguard citizens ' rights and enhance people ' s livelihood, safeguard national security, protect the eco- environment and improve government functions . It will also take targeted efforts to build a comprehensive, scientific , effective and law-based government administrati on system. Third, s cientific policy-making to provide policy guarantee for the 2030 Agenda. Keeping in mind the goal s of the 2030 Agenda, t he Chinese government will establish a comprehensive policy system , which is led by national policies and supported by specialized policies and local14 policies , with emphasis on the following ten aspects: eliminating poverty and hunger, maintaining economic growth, advancing industrialization, improving social security and social services, safeguarding equity and justice, strengthen ing environmental protection, addressing the climate change, enhanc ing energy and resource efficiency, improving national governance and promoting international cooperation. Fourth, c larifying government responsibilities by hold ing governments at all levels accountable. China will not only enhance the horizontal cross-region and inter-agency coordination, but also establish a vertical implementation mechanism link ing the central, local and grassroots levels . China ' s domestic inter-agency coordination mechanism comprised of 43 government departments has been established for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and its local governments will set up corresponding working mechanisms to ensure smooth implementation. 3. Social Mobilization The general public ' s understanding , recognition and participation is key to consistent and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The emphasis will be place d on the following three aspects : First, enhanc ing the sense of responsibility in participin g in the implementation. Adhering to the principle of putting people first, China will implement the 2030 Agenda by the people and for the people . China will help its people fully appreciate the personal and public interests in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and enhance their initiative and sense of responsibility in the implementation . Second, extensive use of the media for social mobilization. China will make the 2030 Agenda more accessible to the general public and create a good environment for the implementation via newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet, as well as publicity campaigns in the form of feature program, publicity week on sustainable development, interview, expert interpretation , knowledge quiz, etc. Third, promot ing public participation. China will engag e non - governmental groups, the private sector and individuals especially the you th in training courses , networking and management activities related to the 2030 Agenda , to help them realize the importance of coordinated economic, social and environmental development and build a broad-based social consensus on the 2030 Agenda . Governments at all levels will play their due role in coordinat ion , mobiliz ation ,15 implementation and supervis ion to form the social synergy for the Agenda . 4. Resource I nput Resource input aims at fully utilizing the domestic and international markets and resources and giving full play to the institutional and market advantages in the implementation efforts. The focus is placed on the following three aspects. First, f ocusing on fiscal, tax ation and financial reforms and rationally setting aside and guaranteeing government funds for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda . China will establish a financial system with rational division of labor and complementarities among different financial sectors such as the commercial, development -oriented , policy -oriented and the cooperative, while guiding the financial industry to better serve sustainable development and developing inclusive finance. Second, i nnovating in cooperation models. China will promote cooperation between the government and the social capital , and mobiliz e and guid e social resources into sustainable development by improving laws and regulations, giv ing preferential policies , improving government services, and strengthening publicity work and guidance . Third, s trengthening international cooperation and exchanges. With an open and inclusive attitude, China welcomes advanced development concept s, technological expertise and quality resources from other countries for its sustainable development. 5. Risk M anagement Despite being the world ' s second largest economy and with a modest level of GNI per capita , China i s still facing daunting development tasks and its development is far from balanced between different regions and rural and urban areas. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda is a long-term, arduous task, requiring sound risk management mechanism s and capabilit ies . Targeted efforts are needed in the following four aspects : First, m aintaining economic growth. China will continue its commitment to the general principle of making progress while working to keep performance stable, deepen reform and opening up, advance the supply-side structural reform, i mplement the innovation-driven strategy,16 actively promote mass entrepreneurship and innovation, cu ltivate new momentum and ensure sustained, healthy and stable economic growth, so as to provide a solid economic foundation for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Second, i mproving the quality of people ' s lives. China has taken targeted measures to alleviate and eliminate poverty and speed up the development of poverty-stricken areas. Efforts will be made to achieve high-quality employment and enhance public service capabilities for employment and entrepreneurship. Public goods and services will be increased , and improve ment will be made to the public service s system, cover ing employment, education , social security and health care . The income distribution system will be optimized to ensure that the gains from implementation of the 2030 Agenda are fairly shared by all . Third, f ocusing on balanced and coordinated development in the three major areas of economic growth, social progress and environmental protection. Public awareness should be raised concerning ecological conservation featuring respect for, conformity with and protection of nature. It is imperative to step up environmental protection efforts, focus on improving environmental quality, adopt the strictest environmental protection regime, promote comprehensive prevention and control of air, water and soil pollution, form a system of integrated environmental governance by governments, enterprises and the public , and achieve overall improvement of the environmental quality . Efforts should be made to strengthen the protection and recovery of natural ecological system, and build protective barriers for eco-security. Fourth, a dvancing the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity. Efforts will be made to establish funda men tal institutions for various sectors, improve people ' s democracy, achieve law-based government administration and increase judicial credibility. Human rights and intellectual property rights will be effectively protected. A new pattern of open economic system has basically take n shape. The modern military system with Chinese characteristics will be improved and the Party building will be further institutionalized. 6. International C ooperation The 2030 Agenda has accommodate d the common interests of the international community to the largest extent possible and therefore is universally applicable. China will join the international community in17 deepening international development cooperation for effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Focus will be placed on the following four aspects : First, a cknowledging diversities in nature, culture and national conditions, China respect s the right of other countries to choose their independent development path and advocate s increased exchange s and mutual learning among national governments, social organizations and stakeholders in the implementation efforts according to the Principle of \" Common but Differentiated Responsibilities \" . Second, work ing towards a more equitable and balanced global partnership for development . The international community should maintain North-South cooperation as the main channel for development cooperation. Developed countries should honor their Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments in a timely and adequate manner, scale up their support for developing countries. It is important to give full play to technology promotion mechanism, including by way of setting up technology banks, to help promote technology development of developing countries and the transfer, spread and promotion of environment-friendly technology to developing countries. Third, d eeper involvement in South-South cooperation. China will fulfill it s international obligations by providing more public goods for global development and promoting a greater role of the Assistance Fund for South-South Cooperation, China-UN Peace and Development Fund, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and New Development Bank in helping o the r developing countries implement the 2030 Agenda. China will also continue to advance the \" Belt and Road \" I nitiative and international cooperation i n industrial capacity to achieve greater complementarity. Fourth, p rudently promoting tri angular cooperation. While fully respecting the will of recipient countries , China will work with other multilateral and bilateral assistance providers to prudently promote triangular cooperation for greater complementarity, diversified assistance methods, and improved assistance results. We will encourage the private sector, civil society, philanthropic groups and other stakeholders to play a bigger role. 7. Oversight and Review18 Oversight and review is used to assess achievements, challenges and inadequacies in the process of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, in order to optimize policy options and summarize best practices. Targeted efforts will be made in the following three aspects : First, China will conduct reviews of its implementation efforts simultaneously with annual assess ment of the progress in the 13th Five-Year Plan and corresponding work plans in specific sectors. The inter - agency mechanism has assigned the 169 targets of the 2030 Agenda to specific g overnment agencies, ensuring full accountability for every review task . Second, China will a ctively participat e in follow-up reviews at the international and regional levels. China supports the central role of the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and will assist it in the regular reviews of global implementation progress . China will also use the forum as a platform to strengthen exchanges with other countries and solicit opinions and suggestions. China welcomes enhanc ed regional cooperation and the positive contributions of the United Nations ' regional commissions and specialized agencies. Third, China will s trengthen cooperation with the United Nations System in China and other international organizations by organizing workshops and compiling and releasing regular reports on China ' s implementation of the 2030 Agenda to fully r eview the progress in implementation of all the Sustainable Development G oals in China .19 V.
