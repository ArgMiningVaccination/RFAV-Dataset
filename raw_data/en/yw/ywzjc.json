While I love to immerse myself in a bath or the ocean when possible, taking a Spiritual Shower is a practical daily ritual that can rejuvenate your mind, body and spirit, opening a pathway for healing and creativity to flow. All it takes is a few minutes and the intention to make this a restorative experience. Set the mood. Before you turn on the water for your shower, bless the space by burning incense and/or lighting a candle in the bathroom. I love handmade, eco-friendly candles by [Guided Flame Co.]and Pink Moon's [Claire de Lune]. If you'd not to light anything, try these [Flameless Flicker Candles]or use a diffuser with your favorite essential oils. Set an intention. As you get ready to step into the shower, think about your intention for this ritual. It can be something specific or an overall feeling you'd like to experience. Bonus: Write an affirmation that supports your intention on a post-it and attach it to your bathroom mirror. In the shower. Spend the first few minutes just feeling the water on your skin and taking a few deep breaths. Bring your intention to mind and allow yourself some time to think, pray or simply listen for any messages. As you begin to wash your body, imagine that you're cleansing away any negative emotions you'd like to release. Note: Plant-based bath and body products elevate the bathing experience from a routine to a ritual. Not only will you feel divine about using products that are safer for your skin, body and the planet, natural ingredients, such as essential oils, can be transformative. Studies have shown that essential oils can help relieve stress, boost your mood and enhance concentration. Try [Bathing Culture's Mind & Body Wash]for a luxurious, earthy cleanse or [Dr. Bronner's Castile Soap]for a budget friendly, yet fabulous option. After the shower. As you're drying off, reflect on what thoughts you'd like to bring into your day or evening. If you posted an affirmation on your mirror, read or say it out loud at least a few times. Once your skin is dried off, anoint yourself with an all natural, plant-based body oil. As you apply the oil over each body part, send yourself love and healing energy through your hands. Take a few moments to practice self-love and appreciate your body in all of its wonder and beauty! My favorite body oil indulgences are max & me's [Circle of Protection Body Oil]and Bathing Culture's [Outer Being Face & Body Oil], both of which contain many nourishing, plant-based ingredients. Now your Spiritual Shower Ritual is complete and you're ready to and start your day or head to bed, feeling like the goddess you are! Bonus: Grab a notebook and write down any insights you had while practicing this ritual. Some of my best ideas have come to me in the shower!
