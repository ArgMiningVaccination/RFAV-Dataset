Panobinostat and everolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. - [Myeloma Referral Study (Race, Ethnicity, and Familial Etiologic Relationship, Risk Association, and Linkage Study)](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20316349) Rochester, MN The goal of the present study is to answer the question of whether there are clinically relevant subtypes of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM) that are associated with populations at high risk for developing these conditions using an online survey and submission of de-identified medical information. - [Symptomatic Assessment in Patients with Chronic Hematologic Malignancies](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20308920) Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of survey assessment in symptom evaluation of patient with chronic hematologic malignancies. - [A Study of CART-TnMUC1 in Patients With TnMUC1-Positive Advanced Cancers](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20509258) Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of the administration of genetically-modified autologous T cells (CART-TnMUC1 cells) engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) capable of recognizing the tumor antigen, TnMUC1 and activating the T cell (CART- TnMUC1 cells). to Evaluate CCS1477 in Haematological Malignancies](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20533340) Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ The purpose of this study is primarily designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CCS1477 in patients with relapsed or B or CCS1477 is a potent, and orally bioavailable inhibitor the bromodomain of p300 and CBP, critical transcriptional co-activators of genes that drive cell proliferation and survival. The compound causes G1 cell cycle arrest and is anti-proliferative across a broad range of haematological cell models, representative of AML, MM and lymphomas. This is also accompanied by an increase in myeloid differentiation in ... - [Mayo Clinic Cancer Genomics WI; Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ; Jacksonville, FL; Rochester, MN The goal of the study is to create a database of clinical information and a repository of biological specimens for genetic, molecular and microbiological research to better understand hereditary cancer and help develop new therapies and preventive strategies. - [A Phase 1/2 Study of CYT-0851 in B-Cell Malignancies Solid Tumors](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20490905) Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ; Rochester, MN; Jacksonville, FL The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CYT-0851 in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies and advanced solid tumors and to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose for evaluation in these patients. - [cfMeDIP-seq Assay Prospective Observational Validation for Early Cancer Detection and Minimal Residual Disease (CAMPERR)](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20538231) Rochester, MN The purpose of this multicenter prospective observational case-control study is to train and validate Adela's cfMeDIP-seq based methylome profiling platform to detect and differentiate multiple cancer subtypes. In addition, this study includes longitudinal follow-up for a subset of participants to train and validate the methylome profiling platform to detect minimal residual disease and recurrence. - [Collecting Blood Samples From Patients With and Without Cancer to Evaluate Tests for Early Cancer Detection](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20541353) Albert Lea, MN; Eau Claire, WI; La Crosse, WI; Mankato, MN The purpose of this study is to collect blood and tissue samples from patients with and without cancer to evaluate laboratory tests for early cancer detection which may help researchers develop tests for the early detection of cancers. - [Understanding the Challenges, Behavioral Patterns, and Preferences Towards Participation in Clinical Trials in Minority Patient Populations](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20474323) Jacksonville, FL; Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ; Rochester, MN The purpose of this study is to evaluate the challenges, behavioral patterns, and preferences of minority patient participation in clinical trials. Also, to develop and validate a personalized clinical trial educational platform to boost participation among underserved cancer patients. - [\"Prescribing\" Exercise to Cancer Patients at High-Risk for Falls](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20474788) Rochester, MN Falls are common and catastrophic in cancer patients. Cancer patients are vulnerable to falls due to muscle loss. In prescribing exercise in a data driven manner to cancer patients, our hypothesis is this \"prescription\" for exercise will eventually be demonstrated to reduce the occurrence of injurious falls. "}
