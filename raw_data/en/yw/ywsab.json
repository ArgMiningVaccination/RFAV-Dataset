Collegial, Educational, and/or Informal Proceedings 1.1 Criteria for Initiation These Bylaws encourage M edical Staff leaders and hospital management to use progressive steps, beginning with collegial and education efforts, to address questions relating to an individual 's clinical practice and/or professional conduct. The goal of these progressive steps is to help the individual voluntarily respond to resolve questions raised. All collegial intervention efforts by Medical Staff leaders and hospital management shall be con sidered confidential and part of the hospital 's performance improvement and professional and peer review activities. Collegial intervention efforts are encouraged, but are not mandatory, and shall be within the discretion of the appropriate M edical Staff l eaders and hospital management. When any observations arise suggesting opportunities for a practitioner to improve their clinical skills or professional behavior , the matter should be referred for peer review in accordance with the peer review and performance improvement policies adopted by the M edical Staff and hospital. Collegial intervention efforts may include but are not limited to the following: a. Educating and advising colleagues of all applicable policies, including those related to appropriate behavi or, emergency call obligations, and the timely and adequate completion of medical records; b. Following up on any questions or concerns raised about the clinical practice and/or conduct of privileged practitioners and recommending such steps as proctoring, monitoring, consultation, and letters of guidance; and c. Sharing summary comparative quality, utilization, and other relevant information to assist individuals to conform their practices to appropriate norms. Following collegial intervention efforts , if it app ears the practitioner 's performance places patients in danger or compromises the quality of care, or in cases where it appears patients may be placed in harm 's way while collegial interventions are undertaken, the MEC will consider whether it should be rec ommended to the Board to restrict or revoke the practitioner 's membership and/or privileges. Before issuing such a recommendation the MEC may authorize an investigation for the purpose of gathering and evaluating any evidence and its sufficiency . 63/148 MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS Page 2 Part II: Investigations, Corrective Action, Hearing and Appeal Plan Section 2. Investiga tions 2.1 Initiation A request for an investigation mus t be submitted in writing by a M edical Staff Officer, committee chair, CEO , CMO, hospital B oard chair , or Clinical Service Chief for a member of that Clinical Service, to the MEC . The Chief of Staff shall notify the ADCA, the Dean, the CMO and Chief of Staff, the member and their Chair/Chief of a request for investigation . The request must be supported by references to the specific activities or conduct of concern. T he MEC itself may initiate an investigation , and shall appropriately document its reasons and notify the practitioner and the Clinical Service Chief and Department Chair , if applicable . 2.2 Investigation If the MEC decides an investigation is warranted, it shall direct an inv estigation to be undertaken through the adoption of a formal resolution. In the event the Board believes the MEC has incorrectly determined an investigation is unnecessary, it may direct the MEC to proceed with an investigation. The MEC may conduct the investigation itself or assign the investigation to an ad hoc committee of the M edical Staff. Deferral to ADCA and/or CMO . 2.2.1.1. When, in the opinion of the Medical Executive Committee, allegations in a written request for professional review of a Member do not ris e to a level ordinarily requiring invocation of professional review and/or corrective action, the MEC may refer the matter to the ADCA or the CMO or their designee(s) for further evaluation, with an opportunity for the affected Member to be heard in a manner to be decided by the ADCA or their designee. 2.2.1.2. Action by the ADCA, CMO, or their designee resulting from such inquiries may not adversely affect the Member, his or her membership on the Medical Staff, or the exercise of his or her privileges beyond thirte en (13) days without further investigation and action of the MEC as set forth more fully in these Bylaws. 2.2.1.3. Documentation regarding the act or omission leading to any such evaluation under this sub -section will be maintained in the affected Member's credenti aling file and may be considered in any subsequent credentialing review or professional review of the Member, along with the practitioner's compliance or failure to comply with the corrective action. The affected Member will not be entitled to hearing or appeal procedures as set forth in these Bylaws. The ADCA, CMO, or their designee will report on such evaluation and actions at the next regularly scheduled MEC meeting. 64/148 MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS Page 3 Part II: Investigations, Corrective Action, Hearing and Appeal Plan 2.2.2 Assignment to the Ad Hoc Committee If the investigation is delegated to a committee other than the MEC, the MEC shall appoint three members to such committee, and such committee shall proceed with the investigation promptly and forward a written report of its findings, conclusions, and recomm endations to the MEC as soon as feasible but no longer than 30 days. The committee conducting the investigation shall have the authority to review all documents it considers relevant, to interview individuals, to consider appropriate clinical literature an d practice guidelines, and to utilize the resources of an external consultant if it deems a consultant is necessary and such action is approved by the MEC and the CEO . The investigating body may also require the practitioner under review to undergo a physi cal and/or mental examination and may access the results of such exams. The investigating body shall notify the practitioner in question of the allegations that are the basis for the investigation and provide to the practitioner an opportunity to provide i nformation in a manner and upon such terms as the investigating body deems appropriate . The meeting between the practitioner in question and the investigating body (and meetings with any other individuals the investigating body chooses to interview) shall not constitute a \" hearing \" as term is used in the hearing and appeals sections of these Bylaws. The procedural rules with respect to hearings or appeals shall not apply to these meetings either. The individual being investigated shall not have the right to be represented by legal counsel before the investigating body nor to compel the M edical Staff to engage external consultation. Despite the status of any investigation, the MEC shall retain the authority and discretion to take whatever action may be warran ted by the circumstances, including suspension, termination of the investigative process; or other action. 2.2.2.1 An external peer review consultant should be considered when: a. Litigation seems likely; b.

The MEC will make such a determination as soon as feasible. The Chief of Staff, with the approval of the CMO or CEO , may reinstate the practitioner 's privileges or membership after determining the triggering circumstances have been rectified or are no longer present .

Unless otherwise indicated by the terms of the summary suspension, the practitioner 'spatients shall be promptly assigned to another M edical Staff Member by the Chief of Staff or designee, co nsidering, where feasible, the wishes of the affected practitioner and the patient in the choice of a substitute practitioner. 3.2.1.1 Right to Rescind Summary Suspension or Restriction. The Medical Staff leader and hospital administrator who initially imposed a summary suspension ma y rescind that summary suspension or restriction with notice to the practitioner, the Clinical Service Chief, the MEC through the Chief of Staff , the Dean, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the CEO, and the B oard through the CEO . MEC action : In the event that the summary suspension has not been automatically lifted, a s soon as feasible and within fourteen ( 14) calendar days after such summary suspension has been imposed, the MEC shall meet to review and consider the action and if necessary begin the investigation process as noted in Section 2.2 above. Upon request and at the discretion of the MEC, the practitioner will be given the opportunity to address the MEC concerning the action, on such terms and conditions as th e MEC may impose, although in no event shall any meeting of the MEC, with or without the practitioner, constitute a \" hearing \" as defined in this hearing and appeal plan, nor shall any procedural rules with respect to hearing and appeal apply. The MEC may m odify, continue, or terminate the summary suspension, but in any event , it shall furnish the practitioner with notice of its decision. Procedural rights : Unless the MEC promptly terminates the summary suspension prior to or immediately after reviewing the results of any investigation described above , the Member or other physician or dentist with privileges without membership shall be entitled to the procedural rights afforded by this hearing and appeal plan once the summary suspension last s more than fourt een ( 14) calendar days. 71/148 MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS Page 10 Part II: Investigations, Corrective Action, Hearing and Appeal Plan Section 4.

Clinical Privileges 5.1 Exercise of privileges A practitioner providing clinical services at the hospital may exercise only those privileges granted to him/her by the Board or emergency or disaster privileges as described herein. Privileges may be granted by the Board, upon recommendation of the MEC to practitioners who are not M embers of the M edical Staff. Such individuals may be chiropractors, doctors of oriental medicine, physicians serving as telemedicine physicians, or others deemed appropriate by the MEC and Board. 5.2 Requests When applicable, each application for appointment or reappointment to the M edical Staff or for privileges must contain a request for the specific clinical privileges the appli cant desires. Specific requests must also be submitted for temporary privileges and for modifications of privileges in the interim between reappointments and/or granting of privileges. 5.3 Basis for Privileges Determination Requests for clinical privileges will be considered only when accompanied by evidence of education, training, experience, and demonstrated current competence as specified by the hospital in its Board approved criteria for clinical privileges. Requests for clinical privileges will be consi stently evaluated on the basis of prior and continuing education, training, experience, utilization practice patterns, current ability to perform the privileges requested, and demonstrated current competence, ability, and judgment. Additional factors may b e used in determining privileges are patient care needs and the hospital 's capability to support the type of privileges being requested and the availability of qualified coverage in the applicant 's absence. The basis for privileges determination to be made in connection with periodic reappointment or a requested change in privileges must include documented clinical performance and results of the practitioner 's performance improvement program activities. Privilege determinations will also be based on pertinent information from other sources, such as peers and/or faculty from other institutions and health care settings where the practitioner exercises clinical privileges. The procedure by which requests for clinical privileges are processed are as outlined in Section 3 above. 5.4 Special Conditions for Dental Privileges Requests for clinical privileges for dentists are processed in the same manner as all other privile ge requests. Privileges for surgical procedures performed by dentists and/or oral and maxillofacial surgeons will require all dental patients receive a basic medical evaluation (history and physical) by a physician M ember of the M edical Staff with privileg es to perform such an evaluation, which will be recorded in the medical record. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons may be granted the privilege of performing a history and physical on their own patients upon submission of documentation of completion of an acc redited postgraduate residency in oral and maxillofacial surgery and demonstrated current competence. 102/148 MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS Page 18 Part III: Credentials Procedures Manual 5.5 Special Conditions for Podiatric Privileges Requests for clinical privileges for podiatrists are processed in the same manner as all other privilege reque sts. All podiatric patients will receive a basic medical evaluation (history and physical) by a physician M ember of the M edical Staff will be recorded in the medical record. Podiatrists may be granted the privilege of performing a history and physical on t heir own patients upon submission of documentation of completion of an accredited postgraduate residency in podiatric surgery and d emonstrated current competence. 5.6 Special conditions for practitioners eligible for privileges without membership Requests for privileges from such individuals are processed in the same manner as requests for clinical privileges by providers eligible for M edical Staff membership, with the exception such individuals are not eligible for membership on the M edical Staff and do not ha ve the rights and privileges of such membership. Only those categories of practitioners approved by the Board for providing services at the hospital are eligible to apply for privileges. 5.7 Special Conditions for Fellows in Training Fellows in training in th e hos pital shall not normally hold membership on the Medical Staff and shall not nor mally be gr anted specific clinical privileges unless they are functioning in an unaccredited program. Rather, they shall be permitted to function clinically only in accord ance with the written training pr otocols developed by the Graduate Medical Education Committee in conju nction with the residency training program. The protocols must delineate the roles, responsibilities, and patient care activities of residents and fello ws including which types of residents may write patient care orders, under what circumstances why they may do so, and what entries a supervising physician must countersign. The protocol must also describe the mechanisms through which resident directors and supervisors make decisions about a resident's progressive involvement and independence in delivering patient care and how these decisions will be communicated to appropriate Medical Staff and hospital leaders. The post -graduate education program director or committee must communicate periodically with the MEC and the Board about the performance of its residents, patient safety issues, and quality of patient care and must work with the MEC to assure all supervising physicians possess clinical privileges co mmensurate with their supervising activities. 5.8 Telemedicine Privileges Requests for telemedicine privileges at the hospital includ ing patient care, treatment, and services will be processed through one of the following mechanisms: a. The hospital fully privile ges and credentials the practitioner if the telemedicine hospital/entity is not Joint Commission accredited ; or b. The hospital privileges practitioners using credentialing information from the distant site if the distant site is a Joint Commission accredited hospital or telemedicine entity and the information is then processed through the routine M edical Staff credentialing and privileging process . The distant -site practitioner must have a license issued or recognized by the State of New Mexico . 103/148 MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS Page 19 Part III: Credentials Procedures Manual 5.9 Temporary Privileges The CEO , or designee, acting on behalf of the Board and based on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff or designee, may grant temporary privileges . Temporary privileges may be granted only in one (1) circumstances: 1) to fulfill an important patient care, treatment , or service need . Any applicant desiring temporary privileges when they are an initial applicant with a complete application that raises no concerns is awaiting review and ap proval of the MEC and the Board will be processed using the expedited credentialing process. Important Patient Care, Treatment, or Service Need: Temporary privileges may be granted on a case by case basis when an important patient care, treatment , or service need exists that mandates an immediate authorization to practice, for a limited period of time, not to exceed 120 calendar days. When granting such privileges , the organized M edical Staff verifies current licensure and current competence. Clean Application Awaiting Approval: These applications will be processed using the expedited credentialing process. Special requirements of consultation and reporting may be imposed as part of the granting of temporary privileges. Except in unusual circumstan ces, temporary privileges will not be granted unless the practitioner has agreed in writing to abide by the Bylaws, rules, and regulations and policies of the M edical Staff and hospital in all matters relating to their temporary privileges. Whether or not such written agreement is obtained, these Bylaws, rules, regulations, and policies control all matters relating to the exercise of clinical privileges. Termination of temporary privileges: The CEO , acting on behalf of the Board and after consultation with the Chief of Staff, may terminate any or all of the practitioner 's privileges based upon the discovery of any information or the occurrence of any event of a nature which raises questions about a practitioner 's privileges. When a patient 's life or wellbei ng is endangered, any person entitled to impose a summary suspension unde r the Medical Staff Bylaws may affect the termination. In the event of any such termination, the practitioner 's patients then will be assigned to another practitioner by the Chief of Staff or their designee. The wishes of the patient shall be considered, when feasible, in choosing a substitute practitioner. Rights of the practitioner with temporary privileges: A practitioner is not entitled to the procedural rights afforded in Part II of these Bylaws (Investigation, Corrective Action, Hearing and Appeal Plan) because their request for temporary privileges is refused or because all or any part of their temporary privileges are terminated or suspended unless the decision is based on clin ical incompetence or unprofessional conduct. Emergency Privileges: In the case of a medical emergency, any practitioner is authorized to do everything possible to save the patient 's life or to save the patient from serious harm, to the degree permitted by the practitioner 's license, regardless of Clinical Service affiliation, staff category, or level of privileges. A practitioner exercising emergency privileges is obligated to summon all consultative assistance deemed necessary and to arrange appropriate f ollow -up. 104/148 MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS Page 20 Part III: Credentials Procedures Manual Disaster Privileges: a. If the institution 's Disaster Plan has been activated and the organization is unable to meet immediate patient needs, the CEO and other individuals as identified in the institution 's Disaster Plan with similar authority may, on a case by case basis consistent with medical licensing and other relevant state statutes, grant disaster privileges to selected licensed independent practitioners ( LIPs ). These practitioners must present a valid government -issued photo identification is sued by a state or federal agency (e.g., driver 's license or passport) and at least one of the following: i. A current picture hospital ID card clearly identifies professional designation; ii. A current license to practice; iii. Primary source verification of the license; iv. Identification indicating the individual is a member of a Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT), or Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR - VHP), or other recognized state or fed eral organizations or groups; v. Identification indicating the individual has been granted authority to render patient care, treatment, and services in disaster circumstances (such authority having been granted by a federal, state, or municipal entity); or vi. Identification by a current hospital or M edical Staff Member (s) who possesses personal knowledge regarding the volunteer 's ability to act as a licensed independent practitioner during a disaster. b. The Medical Staff has a mechanism (i.e., badging) to readily identify volunteer practitioners who have been granted disaster privileges. c. The Medical Staff oversees the professional performance of volunteer practitioners who have been granted disaster privileges by direct observation, mentoring, or clinical record review. The organization makes a decision (based on information obtained regarding the professional practice of the volunteer) within 72 hours whether disaster recovery privileges should be continued. d. Primary source verification of licensure begins as soon as the immediate situation is under control, and is completed within seventy -two ( 72) hours from the time the volunteer practitioner presents to the organization. If primary source verification cannot be completed in seventy -two (72) hours, there is documentation of the following: 1) why primary source verification could not be performed in seventy - two (72) hours; 2) evidence of a demonstrated ability to continue to provide adequate care, treatment, and services; and 3) an attempt to rectify the situation as soon as possible. e. Once the immediate situation has passed and such determination has been made consistent with the institution 's Disaster Plan, the practitioner 's disaster privileges will terminate immediately. f. Any individual identified in the institutio n's Disaster Plan with the authority to grant disaster privileges shall also have the authority to terminate disaster privileges. Such authority may be exercised in the sole discretion of the hospital and will not give rise to a right to a fair hearing or an appeal. 105/148 MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS Page 21 Part III: Credentials Procedures Manual Section 6. Clinical Competency Evaluation 6.1 Focused Professional Practice Evaluation (FPPE) All initially requested privileges shall undergo a period of FP PE. The credentials committee, after receiving a recommendation from the Clinical Service Chief , will define the circumstances which require monitoring and evaluation of the clinical performance of each practitioner following his or her initial grant of clinical privileges at the hospital. Such monitoring may utilize prospective, concurrent, or retros pective proctoring, including but not limited to: chart review, the tracking of performance monitors/indicators, external peer review, simulations, morbidity and mortality reviews, and discussion with other healthcare individuals involved in the care of each patient. The credentials committee will also establish the duration for such FPPE and triggers indicat ing the need for performance monitoring. 6.2 Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE) The Medical Staff will also engage in OPPE to identify professional practice trends affect ing quality of care and patient safety. Information from this evaluation process will be factored into the decision to maintain existing privileges, to revise existing privileges, or to revoke an existing privilege prior to or at the time of reappointment. OPPE shall be undertaken as part of the Medical Staff's evaluation, measurement, and improvement of practitioner 's current clinical competency. In addition, each practitioner may be subject to FPPE when issues affecting the provision of safe, high quality patient care are identified through the OPPE process. Decisions to assign a period of performance monitoring or evaluation to further assess current competence must be based on the evaluation of an individual 's current clinical competence, practice behavior, and ability to perform a specific privilege. 6.3 Practitioner Re-Entry A practitioner who has not provided care within an area of practice within the past two (2) years who requests clinical privileges at the hospital mu st arrange for a preceptorsh ip, acceptable to the credentials committee and MEC, either with a current M ember in good standing of the M edical Staff who practices in the same specialty or with a training program or other equivalently competent practitioner practicing outside of the hospital. If a practitioner has not provided any clinical care within the past five (5) years as determined by their New Mexico licensing board or the MEC, they may be required to go through a formal re -entry process through an AC GME or AOA accredited residency program or other formal process to assess and confirm clinical competence. The practitioner must assume responsibility for any financial costs required to fulfill these requirements. A description of the preceptorship or tra ining program, including details of monitoring and consultation must be written and submitted for approval to the Clinical Service Chief and/or credentials committee and MEC. At a minimum, the preceptorship or training program description must include the following: a. The scope and intensity of the required activities; b. The requirement for submission of a written report from the preceptor or training program prior to termination of the preceptorship period assessing, at a minimum, the applicant 's demonstrated clinical competence related to the privileges requested, ability to get along with others, the quality and timeliness of medical records documentation, ability to perform the privileges requested, and professional ethics and conduct. 106/148 MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS Page 22 Part III: Credentials Procedures Manual Section 7. Reapplication after Mo difications of Membership Status or Privileges and Exhaustion of Remedies 7.1 Reapplication after adverse credentials decision Except as otherwise determined by the MEC or Board, a practitioner who has received a final adverse decision or who has resigned or w ithdrawn an application for appointment or reappointment or clinical privileges while under investigation or to avoid an investigation is not eligible to reapply to the M edical Staff or for clinical privileges . 7.2 Request for modification of appointment status or privileges A practitioner , either in connection with reappointment or at any other time, may request modification of staff category, Clinical Service assignment, or clinical privileges by submitting a written request to Medical Staff Affairs. A m odification request must be on the prescribed form and must contain all pertinent information supportive of the request. All requests for additional clinical privileges must be accompanied by information demonstrating additional education, training, and cu rrent clinical competence in the specific privileges requested. A modification application is processed in the same manner as a reappointment, which is outlined in Section 5 of this manual. A practitioner who determines they no longer exercise, or wish to restrict or limit the exercise of, particular privileges they have been granted shall send written notice, through Medical Staff Affairs, to the credentials committee, and MEC. A copy of this notice shall be included in the practitioner 's credentials file. 7.3 Resignation of staff appointment or privileges A practitioner who wishes to resign their staff appointment and/or clinical privileges must provide written notice to the appropriate Clinical Service Chief or Chief of Staff. The resignation shall specify th e reason for the resignation and the effective date. A practitioner who resigns their staff appointment and/or clinical privileges is obligated to fully and accurately complete all residual medical staff obligations, including ava ilable portions of all medical records for which they are responsible prior to the effective date of resignation. Failure to do so may result in an entry in the practitioner 's credentials file acknowledging the resignation and indicating it became effective under unfavorable circum stances. 7.4 Exhaustion of administrative remedies Every practitioner agrees they will exhaust all the administrative remedies afforded in the various sections of this manual, the Governance and the Investigation, Corrective Action, Hearing and Appeal Plan bef ore initiating legal action against the hospital or its agents. 7.5 Reporting requirements The CEO through their designee, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs shall be responsible for assuring the hospital satisfies its obligations under State law and the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 and its successor statutes. Whenever a practitioner 's privileges are limited, revoked, or in any way constrained, the hospital must, in accordance with State and Federal laws or regulations, report those constrai nts to the appropriate State and Federal authorities, registries, and/or data bases, such as the NPDB. Reportable actions include, but are not limited to, any negative professional review action against a physician or dentist related to clinical incompeten ce or miscon duct that leads to a denial of appointment and/or reappointment; reduction in clinical privileges for greater than thirty (30) calendar days; resignation, surrender of privileges, or acceptance of privilege reduction either during an investigat ion or to avoid an investigation . 107/148 MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS Page 23 Part III: Credentials Procedures Manual Section 8. Practitioners Providing Contracted Services 8.1 When the hospital contracts for care services with licensed independent practitioners who provide readings of images, tracings, or specimens through a telemedicine mechanism, all LIPs who will be providing services under this contract will be permitted to do so only after being granted privileges at the hospital through the mechanisms established in this manual . 8.2 Exclusivity policy Whenever hospital policy specifies certain hospital facilities or services may be provided on an exclusive basis in accordance with contracts or letters of agreement between the hospital and qualified practitioners, then other practitioners must, except i n an emergency or life -threatening situation, adhere to the exclusivity policy in arranging for or providing care. Application for initial appointment or for clinical privileges related to the hospital facilities or services covered by exclusive agreements will not be accepted or processed unless submitted in accordance with the existing contract or agreement with the hospital. Practitioners who have previously been granted privileges, which then become covered by an exclusive contract, will not be able to exercise those privileges unless they become a party to the contract. 8.3 Qualifications A practitioner who is or will be providing specified professional services pursuant to a contract or a letter of agreement with the hospital must meet the same qualificati ons, must be processed in the same manner, and must fulfill all the obligations of their appointment category as any other applicant or staff appointee. 8.4 Disciplinary Action The terms of the M edical Staff Bylaws will govern disciplinary action taken by or recommended by the MEC. 8.5 Effect of contract or employment expiration or termination The effect of expiration or other termination of a contract upon a practitioner 's staff appointment and clinical privileges will be governed solely by the terms of the pract itioner 's contract with the hospital. If the contract or the employment agreement is silent on the matter, then contract expiration or other termination alone will not affect the practitioner 's staff appointment status or clinical privileges. 108/148 MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS Page 24 Part III: Credentials Procedures Manual Section 9. Medical Admin istrative Officers 9.1 A medical administrative officer is a practitioner engaged by the hospital either full or part time in an administratively responsible capacity, whose activities may also include clinical responsibilities such as direct patient care, teaching, or supervision of the patient care activities of other practitioners under the officer 's direction. 9.2 Each medical administrative officer must achieve and maintain M edical Staff appointment and clinical privileges appropriate to their clinical responsibilities and discharge staff obligations appropriate to their staff category in the same manner applicable to all other staff M embers. 9.3 Effect of removal from office or adverse change in appointment status or clinical privileges: Where a contract exists between the officer and the hospital, its terms govern the effect of removal from the medical administrative office on the officer 's staff appointment and privileges and the effect an adverse change in the officer 's staff appointment or clinical privileges h as on their remaining in office. In the absence of a contract or where the contract is silent on the matter, removal from office has no effect on appointment status or clinical privileges. The effect of an adverse change in appointment status or clinical p rivileges on continuance in office will be as determined by the Board. A medical administrative officer has the same procedural rights as all other staff Members in the event of an adverse change in appointment status or clinical privileges unless the change is, by contract a consequence of removal from office. 109/148Separator Page A Resolution 110/148THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO RESOLUTION RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THE HUD DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO'S HUD -INSURED LOAN; AND AUTHORIZING ANY OTHER NECESSARY ACTION TO EFFECT THE DELIVERY OF THE HUD -INSURED LOAN.

Thank you for this opportunity to share some reflections with you from my first 60 days , to learn from you, and to serve the people of New Mexico. Let me say up front that I have come to understand how deeply important UNMH is to our local community, Bernalillo County and indeed to our state. Our hospital and clinics care for everyone , and the pe ople who work in the hospital are united by one of the most powerful commitments to mission that I have experienced over my career. I am extremely impressed and proud of how we are address ing the COVID crisis : caring for patients with COVID; vaccinating ou r fellow community -members at the PIT ; and all the while keeping our staff safe . The COVID response has required unbelieveable work and commitment from the entire UNMH team, frontline workers and caregivers to leadership , and they are still doing that work on top of everything else. I want to thank them and you for your continued leadership during this time. I look forward to learning from all of you on the BOT, and already appreciate so deeply your commitments of time and talent to the UNMH Board. Your support of the hospital and work with hospital leadership truly makes a difference. Reflection of my first 60 days - Over the past 60 days I have had the opportunity to meet, listen and learn from many administrative leaders, faculty, students, and staff in our health system and health sciences campus . I have had the opportunity to tour UNMH, some of the clinics and the mental health center (along with SRMC and the VA) . There are so many points of pride at UNM , in the H ealth Science Center, and our UNM health system . Some key themes are arising on issues and opportunities which I look forward to sharing in the future as I dive more deeply into each . Clearly COVID care, vaccinations, public health , and equity lessons learned are at our forefront; but critically important too are the ongoing efforts to enhanc e quality and safety; improve patient access to primary through tertiary and quarternary care , advocacy and engagement , continue progress on the new Tower , continue successful School of Medicine residency reaccreditation, educat e future healthcare workers, and prepa re for the upcoming Cancer Center site visit on February 10th. Addressing legislative matters at the same time has been invigorating and humbling . Our UNM hospital s and clinics provide so many services and so much expertise only available here - our Level I trauma center, our NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center, hopefully our Comprehensive Stroke Center designation on which we are awaiting a decision. We also provide excellent primar y care that is the foundation of any health system and subspecialty care that is outstanding. There are many pearls - for example , did you know that our medical school is a nation al leader in students choosing Family Medicine, our nursing school is a nati onal leader in midwifery , our pharmacy school is a research leader , and our College of Population Health has taken state leadership roles in addressing the public health challenges surrounding COVID -19? Through many leadership meetings of the UNM Hospital and UNM Health System , I am immers ing myself in our clinical operations , care, finances, community outreach, and strategic 116/1482 thinking . I want to thank CEO Kate Becker and Senior Vice Chancellor Mike Richards , in particular , for their fantastic job of welcom ing me and helping to bring me up to speed. I know I have a lot to learn but really feel like I am getting my footing. They have given me great insights and perspectives as I engage with regents, state leaders ( the Governor, legislators, etc .), donors, community leaders, P atient and Family Advisory Councils , city and county leaders, Diversity Equity and Inclusion leaders, We llness initiative leaders, leaders, deans, and department c hairs who serve as clinical service chiefs . I am impressed and grateful for how UNMH support s all of the HSC's mission areas - of clinical service , teaching, research and community engagement. Vaccinations at The Pit - As many of you know, t he UNM basketball arena has been turned into a mass vaccination site. I was able to visit the PIT for the first time on the day of the soft launch and have become a fan of all the incredible people who have made this happen. I want to thank Eddie Nu \u00f1ez, Director of UNM Athl etics , and his terrific team in the athletics department. Big thanks to our UNM leadership team at the PIT, including Mike Chicarelli, Carol Thornton, Rob Perry, and Christina O'Connell . These leaders have helped us all create, implement, and adapt our pla ns of getting to vaccinating more than 3,000 people a day at this site. As many of you know, New Mexico is a national leader in getting the vaccine out to our community and this challenge has more moving parts than we maybe could have ever imagined. The Pi t site is work ing very well and helps us truly deliver more for New Mexicans. Legislative Session - The 55th legislative session is underway. This 60 -day session is unlike any other previously and while we are not allowed to physically be at the capitol we do have excellent representation by Chief Government Affairs Officer Dr. Barbara Damron and her team. There are many important issues, and we are grateful for the preparation and work of the legislative team and our state partners . Examples of our state partnership programs that could help our UNMH patients and families include the Poison and Drug Information Center ; the Office of the Medical Investig ator focused on learning how to improv e health, safety and justice ; and also the expansion of our Comprehensive Cancer Center facilities and programs. We hope to see State initiatives on health care work force dev elopment that we will be part of. Chief of Staff Change - I wan ted to thank and congratulate Chamiza Pacheco de Alas who has serve d as the EVP & CEO Chief of Staff for the past few years. Chamiza has an incredible opportunity with the W . K. Kellogg foun dation to oversee their New Mexico programs that include improving health . I am sure we will continue to work together . During the transition , please contact Emily Morelli and Alex Sanchez for the support you might need. Issues coming into focus for the coming year - Lastly, I just want to thank you again for your leadership, time, commitment, and the opportunity to start a dialogue with you. In the future I hope to be able to call on you to get your ideas on how to addres s the critical issues we all face. COVID challenges have also been new opportunities to provide clinical services , including expanded and enhanced telehealth , teach our learners, and challenge our researchers. COVID has brought focus to the great health i nequities and the need to address social determinants of health better. How do we further enhance our patient and family advocacy, access, and 117/1483 engagement? How will we better help our faculty, staff, and students transition back to the new normal and better enhance wellness, reduce burnout, and expand career development and leadership development opportunities? As an Academic Health Center, we are committed to our patients and families first as well as educating a workforce for the current and future health needs of New Mexicans a nd our communit ies in order to discover and apply new knowledge to address health challenges , and engage with our community toward better health . Our education and training programs will enhance our workforce development needs , and continue to improve with new innovations while always focus ing on enhancing communication, compassion, dignity, and respect. At a future meeting I hope to be able to share more with you about the initiatives that are occurring in the SOM, COP, CON, and COP H because in an Academic health system we are interconnected to the academics . In conclusion, together we are committed to our health care mission and the need to further the patient experience , listen to their lived experience and wisdom, and work to en hance quality in our quaternary and tertiary specialty care , as well as expand our primary care and population health to serve all New Mexicans. UNMH has a unique mission in our system, serving our Native American community on whose ancestral lands we sit , our County, and our state, and I look forward to partnering with you as we work to deliver more to New Mexico. I am happy to be here, am continuing to learn, and I am grateful for your support. 118/148Separator Page HSC Committee Update 119/148MEMORANDUM To: UNM H Board of Trustees Fr om: Mike Richards , MD Vice Chancellor, UNM Health System D ate: January 29, 2021 S ubject: Monthly Health System Activity Update Thi s report represents unaudited year to date December 2020 activity an d is compared to audited year to date December 2019 activity.

The BOT Native American Services committee pre -viewed our January report to Albuquerque Area I.H.S. concerning selected specialty clinic wait times. The committee acknowledged the hospital's improvement of 6% ov erall, with 10 of the 14 tracked clinics reducing wait time during Q32020. We also provided data to the county through our monthly report; of note, the hospital maintained a Native American bed census above 100 beds for 8 of the 10 months beginning Januar y 2020, with a high of 119 beds occupied, on average, each day in June 2020. UNMH met with APCG during its November session to share information on the New Hospital Tower and the status of our application with HUD, as well as the county approval and AAIHS consultation on the plan. We also provided a detailed update on planned spiritual/ceremonial healing space in the NHT, set aside for use of Native American patients and families. The council acknowledged this was an 'ask' from years ago and shared appre ciation for the plan. UNMH facilitated an introduction of the WC4BIL representatives to the APCG Legislative Council for the purpose of consultation on student -led concerns. The council provided perspective, and some members of the council welcomed more effort around existing work to increase healthcare workforce diversity through pipeline programs. Bernalillo County: UNMH and the County have developed an initial program plan and scope of work for the new Crisis Triage Center at UNMHSC. This is being u sed to finalize and RFP for architectural services for the new facility. UNMH is also working with the county on development of additional Behavioral Health programing to support the continuum of care. The County Commission has approved and executed the needed document related to proceed with the financing of the New Hospital Tower. The County along with the Indian Health Services and the APCG will continue to receive regular updates on the project. If there are any questions on this or other matters, please feel free to contact me. 129/148Separator Page Irene Agostini, MD UNMH Chief Medical Officer The CMO Board report for January will highlight the COVID -19 Therapeutics Committee, the Vaccine Operations Committee along with the status of the COVID -19 Follow -up and Monoclonal Antibody Infusion Clinic . COVID -19 Therapeutics Committee The COVID -19 Therapeutics Committee was e stablished by the EOC Operations Medical Branch . This committee is meeting the need for COVID -19 therapeutics , focus ing on protocols like the bamlanivimab infusion, inpatient treat ment options such as remdesivir and research therapeutic trials currently in process. This committee has repres entat ion from major stakeholders including individuals from the ICU, OB, Hospitalist Teams , ED, Nursing, Pharmacy, IT, Infection Control, SRMC and medicine and family medicine trainees. The committee chair also does frequent chec k-ins with the COVID -19 Follow -Up C linic. The committee scope includes: Review of potential new therapies for COVID -19. Operationalizing new therapies . Monitoring delivery of therapies. Stop therapies that are no longer viewed as standard of care. Reviewing for comment protocols for COVID -19 treatme nt from Pediatrics, OB, Katukuri. Matthew Ley, Nestor Lou Branch, Martha Muller, Miriam Baca, Carla Walraven, Natasha Khan Vaccine Operations Committee As efforts began to focus around the COVID -19 vaccine and distribution, we formed the Vaccine Operations Committee (VOC) led by Dr. Gary Mlady , Mike Chicarelli, Kori Beech, Candra Phillips, Kathleen Denece Kesler . The VOC goals include: Develop , document, and implement efficient and effective plans, processes, and systems to address all aspects of the COVID -19 vaccination initiative including communication and knowledge management. Successfully provide COVID -19 vaccinations to our various patien t populations (including the community ). 131/148 Vaccine Progress : All Health System health care workers that wanted to receive the COVID -19 vaccine were able to do that in the 2ACC Learning Center . Worked close ly with NM DOH to provide our availability for their scheduling system . Once the NM DOH had their vaccine registration site up and running, UNMH began vaccinations at the Pit on Jan. 19, including everyone in Phase 1a. As of Jan. 26, UNMH h as administered 28,001 vaccines! Attachments include the follo wing: COVID -19 Vaccine Operations Committee Organizational Chart. NM DOH Toolkit with information to distribute to patients/community members/anyone receiving the vaccine (FAQs, How to Sign -up) in both Spanish and English. COVID -19 Follow -up Clinic (CFC ) A special clinic was developed for those patients who have t ested positive for COVID - 19. The goal is to see these patients within 48 -72 hours after they have been discharged from the hospital. These are examples of reasons why a patient would be referre d to the CFC: Anyone who has tested positive for COVID -19 infection (all ages, OB) and is a paneled patient at UNMH. Anyone who has tested positive at any clinical site at UNMH and actively infectious or recovering (needs additional COVID -related care and questions related to long -term COVID -19 infection effects). Hospital discharges for close monitoring and determinati on of additional needs at home (DME, supplemental O2, home health). We have seen more than 2 ,000 patients in the CFC since the pandemic began . We are able to keep the patient s at home in stead of in the hospital due to the special care this clinic pr ovides . This has b een extremely valuable to help with our high inpatient census. COVID -19 Monoclonal Antibody Infusion Clinic In addition to the CFC, the COVID -19 Monoclonal Antibody Infusion Clinic was developed for those patients infected with COVID -19 who are considered high -risk for adverse outcomes and are moderate to high risk for hospitalization. This would include patients with confirmed COVID -19 infection who meet certain criteria including but not limited to those with diabetes, chronic kidney diseas e, immunosuppressive disease, etc. Patients are referred as soon as possible after a positive COVID -19 test (ideally within 48 hours). There is some data that these patients have less risk for hospitalization after receiving Monoclonal Antibody infusion . We have completed 140 infusion s of Bamlanivimab. 132/148COVID Vaccination Org Chart 12/20/20 Vaccine Operations Committee (Sponsors /Co- Chairs - Kori Beech Mike Chicarelli and EOC (when activated ) UNMMG CEO and EOC (when activated ) UNMH CEO and EOC (when activated ) Workforce / Staffing Communication and Marketing Logistics and Supplies (other than Vaccine ) Populations Served Regional Collaboration and Communication Regulations and Compliance Vaccination Management Forms / Documentation / Reporting Project Managers : Jeff Weinrach and Christina Cdebaca Project Advisors : Tagg , - Lisa Anselmo Co-Chair - Robert Perry Facilitator - Jeff Weinrach Armijo Dr. Kesler Richard Larson Lisa Leahigh Byron Piatt Milton Saiz Joe Shealy Deborah Stephenson Cynde Tagg Kevin Taylor Kelli Welter Dr. James Welterding Michael WillieChair - Anna Pentler , NM Immunization Coalition Admin - Maggie June , NM Immunization Coalition Support - Jeff Weinrach UNM Participants Dr. Amy Bachyrycz Dr. Denece Kesler Dr. Melissa Martinez Chamiza Pacheco de Alas Robert Perry Mark Rudi Alex Sanchez Kevin Taylor Carol ThorntonChair - Dolly Curran Co-Chair - Jared Bousliman Fowler Dr. Kesler Dr. Beverly Kloeppel Lisa Leahigh Ryan Levi Jess Lewis Robert Perry Milton Saiz Cynde Tagg Kevin Taylor Maribeth Thornton Michelle Wafer Dr. James WilterdingChair - Melissa Johnson Facilitator - Christina Cdebaca Dr. Beverly Kloeppel Lisa Leahigh Dr. Melissa Martinez Paula Martinez Dr. Carolyn Montoya Shannen Ramey Nichole Rogers Milton Saiz Joe Shealy Kevin Taylor Dr. Kevin Vlahovich Michael Willie Dr. James WilterdingCo-Chair - Alex Sanchez Co-Chair Misty Romine Mark Rudi Carol - Carol Thornton Co-Chair , Facilitator - Jeff Weinrach Armijo Jared Bousliman Dr. Meghan Brett Kesler Dr. Beverly Kloeppel Byron Piatt Milton Saiz Misty Salaz Joe Shealy Kevin Taylor Dr. Kevin Vlahovich Kelli Welter Michael Willie Dr. James WilterdingChair - Nick Bodnar Co-Chair - Michael Willie Facilitator - Weinrach Toni Bousliman Jesse Joe Shealy Cynde Tagg Kevin Taylor Enrico Volpato Dr. James WilterdingChair - Angela Vigil Kesler Jared Bousliman Dr. Meghan Brett Dr. Richard Larson Ryan Levi Byron Piatt Kevin Taylor Carol Thornton Marissa Wilson 133/148Will the vaccine be safe? Clinical trials involving many thousands of participants are used to investigate possible COVID-19 vaccines. These studies generate scientific data and other information that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses to determine vaccine safety and effectiveness. After the FDA makes its determination, an independent group of scientific experts - the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) - reviews available data before making vaccine recommendations to the CDC. That means that the scientific data from the research on each of these vaccines has been reviewed by two independent teams of experts. Should I get the vaccine? Yes. While many people with COVID-19 have only a mild illness, others may get a severe case or they may even die. There is no way to know in advance how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you are not at increased risk of severe complications. Also, if you get infected, you may spread the disease to friends, family and others around you. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without having to experience sickness. The sooner most people are vaccinated and protected against COVID-19 disease, the sooner New Mexicans and all Americans can get back to normal life. Will there be enough vaccine for everyone? Vaccines will be prioritized for frontline health care workers in hospital settings. The state will then provide vaccine to other frontline healthcare workers and first responders, as well as staff and residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. This is in line with federal recommendations. This means that not everyone will be able to be vaccinated right away, and vaccine may not be available to the general public until mid-2021. The goal is for everyone to be able to easily get a COVID-19 vaccine when large quantities are available. We expect that several thousand vaccination providers and numerous locations throughout the state will eventually be available, including doctors' offices, retail pharmacies, hospitals, community locations, and federally qualified health centers.What will it cost to get a COVID-19 vaccine? What if I don't have health insurance? The vaccine is free to all people. Vaccination providers will be able to charge an administration fee that is reimbursed by the patient's public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Provider Relief Fund. The federal government is requiring vaccine providers to administer vaccine to people regardless of their insurance status or immigration status. And they must administer with - out charging them for the vaccine. Does the Governor or the Department of Health intend or have plans to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory? No. Can I stop wearing a mask after I have been vaccinated? There is not enough information currently available to say that it's safe to stop wearing a mask after getting the vaccine. A mask protects you, and it also protects your family, friends and community. You should continue to wear a mask, practice social distancing, and wash your hands regularly when around people outside your household. Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive? No. Vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States won't cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have current infection. If your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, there is a possibility you may test positive on some antibody tests. These tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus.HOW DO I REGISTER FOR THE COVID-19 VACCINE?
