Ours tend to be dreamy cocoons of cozy luxury, while many of theirs possess an inherent hospital aesthetic. This dawned on me at the Ad Fontes spa in Switzerland, as I was being attacked by icy algae, then forced into a straitjacket and thrown onto a bed of hay. At this Swiss wellness hotel, as well as at the other spas I have visited across Europe, therapists and customers alike take the therapeutic benefits of their indigenous treatments very seriously. \"Where they think healing, we think indulgence,\" I thought to myself as I rolled in the silage. \"They go to get better. We go to be babied.\" But the great divide is shrinking -- and we're not losing any luxury. The new breed of North American health spa aims to affect long-term lifestyle changes by the most enjoyable means possible. Forget fat farms, and start thinking phat farms. These outfits gear themselves toward healthy eating, relaxation, luxurious treatments, and mind and body fitness. You immerse yourself. You meditate. You consult personal trainers, psychologists and dietitians. And sometimes, you have rubber tubing stuck up your bum. From deluxe antioxidant herbal wraps to awe-inspiring wilderness hikes, the following destination spas share specifically tailored programs to help you lose a few inches or kick-start a healthier lifestyle. Alive Resort, Vernon, B.C. Lowdown: Alive bills itself as a \"health lifestyle centre\" where guests are educated on the importance of health decisions and are taught how to reach their goals -- amid gushing streams and mountain air. Small group sizes (the resort accommodates just 26) mean loads of one-on-one attention. Days are filled with consultations with naturopathic doctors, group hikes, seminars on nutrition and weight management, patio lunches, health-coach appointments and spa treatments. Resort rooms are elegantly designed, and all garner views of the Monashee Mountains. The property's organic farm, meanwhile, supplies the Living Food Kitchen with fresh vegetables, fruit and herbs. The spa is no slouch, either. A full Aveda spa, it's geared toward medical spa treatments rather than pure pampering. But with hot-rock massages, cold-mitten friction therapies and Monashee mud wraps, it's just what the doctor ordered. An added feature is the \"Pre-Health Coach Consultation,\" whereby inquiring clients chat with a health coach over the phone to determine if Alive is right for them. Details: The resort is all-inclusive, so programs such as weight loss include meals, accommodations, seminars, spa treatments, guided walking tours, gym time, doctor appointments, and ground transfers from Vernon. Packages of two, five and 12 days are available, with prices ranging from $550 to $3,500, based on double occupancy.

Red Mountain Spa, Utah Lowdown: Towering red cliffs and rock formations are the backdrop for Red Mountain, a self-styled \"adventure spa\" in the U.S. Southwest. Equally appealing to both ladies and gents, its back door opens onto Snow Canyon State Park, the perfect setting for a roster of outdoor activities such as rock climbing and mountain biking, but especially the spa's hiking program, which offers more than 30 different trails and guided hikes each day -- from \"spirit hikes\" to the full-moon walk -- led by a staff of 40 guides. Back at the spa, get your cholesterol profile, chiropractic care, an orthopedic evaluation or nutrition consultation. Daily classes and lectures range from cooking to stress management, while the spa's restaurant serves up gourmet calorie-wise fare such as pan-seared elk tenderloin with cherry-rhubarb demi-glace. And don't forget the full-service spa, home to Red Mountain massages and gentleman's pedicures, among other things. Details: The five-day, four-night Why Weight Program includes deluxe accommodation, consultation with a nutrition manager, access to guest-speaker series and events, three meals a day, guided morning hikes, unlimited fitness classes, and full use of resort facilities including pools, trails and the fitness centre. The Why Weight Program costs $299 (U.S.) a person a night based on double occupancy. Red Mountain Spa: 1275 E. Red Mountain Circle, Ivins, Utah; Bancroft, tearoom overlooking sparkling Spurr Lake, Grail Springs is a lovely resort of luxurious suites with down-filled chaise lounges and crackling fireplaces. A cocktail and scintillating novel would seem like the obvious plan -- if you weren't here for the TransForm weight-loss program, that is.

Grail Springs Health Retreat & Wellness Spa: 2004 Bay Lake Rd.; [http://www.grailsprings.com](http://www.grailsprings.com); 1-877-553-5772. We Care Holistic Health Centre Desert Hot Springs, Calif. Lowdown: My jaw dropped when I recently saw a story about the We Care Centre on Entertainment Tonight. Celebrities and average Joes had apparently checked their shame at the door, and were laying prone while chatting and sipping curative teas -- all the while with lengths of rubber tubing shoved up their bums. But since the guests reportedly stood to lose as much as four kilograms by visiting the centre, I wanted to learn more. It turns out that fossilized burgers and burritos are flushed from the intestinal tract by cleansing mind, body and soul with an all-liquid diet, coupled with healing body treatments and activities such as the aforementioned colon therapy, as well as yoga, meditation and lymphatic massages. More soothing spa experiences include body scrubs and raindrop therapy. The natural liquid diet is a fresh elixir of Kyogreen, spirulina, wheat grass, barley, acidophilus, vegetable juice, lemon water, enzymes, liver and kidney teas, and a blood purifying tea.

Mountain Trek Fitness Retreat Ainsworth Hot Springs, B.C. All diet and no play makes Jane a grumpy girl. So why not have fun while shedding a few off the rump? Located in the southeastern corner of British Columbia, Mountain Trek is all about secluded, beatific mountain trails. And they're also about their smart FitPlan program, which instructs guests on long-term weight loss through a food = energy = activity = weight-loss concept, in lieu of the ever-popular dieting through deprivation.
