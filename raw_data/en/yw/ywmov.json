But many people need professional support to get through the withdrawal process before they can engage in therapies and interventions that promote lasting recovery. Life Healing Center provides a detoxification (detox) program for adults age 18 and older of all genders. Our adult detox program uses evidence-based practices to help people successfully get on the path to better well-being. Detox Treatment: What Is It? Starting the addiction recovery process can be daunting if you haven't successfully completed withdrawal from the substance you've been using. Detox treatment is designed to help people navigate the withdrawal process safely and with the least amount of physical discomfort. Completing detox helps protect your health and safety and may give you a stronger chance of achieving success as you embark on your recovery journey. Detoxification is often necessary because of the way substance abuse can affect the body. When someone is suffering from an addiction to drugs or alcohol, their body can come to rely on the presence of the substance to function. Once someone ceases or reduces their substance use, it may take their body time to adjust, during which time the person might feel extremely sick. Unfortunately, the fear of facing withdrawal can sometimes make people reluctant to seek the care they need. Without professional support, the withdrawal process can be painful, distressing, and potentially dangerous. Many withdrawal symptoms are similar to those of the flu, but there is also a great deal of variation in how withdrawal presents. Each person's experience is unique and depends on the drug they have been using, along with other factors. Common withdrawal symptoms may include: - Racing heart - Trouble sleeping - Nausea or vomiting - Diarrhea - Constipation - Stomach cramps - Headaches - Muscle pain - Tremors - Anxiety - Intense sweating - Strong drug cravings - Feelings of depression People who try to stop using drugs or alcohol without professional help may return to substance use because withdrawal is so overwhelming. But with the support of a trusted detox program, you can safely rid your body of substances and begin your recovery journey with confidence. If you're struggling with a substance use disorder, it's important to seek professional support to find out whether detox may be right for you.
