It's one of the five pillars of our [Anti-Racism Organizational Change and Accelerated EDI Plan](https://pulse.seattlechildrens.org/seattle-childrens-anti-racism-organizational-change-plan/). Following the work in April 2021 of a multidisciplinary group that examined how Seattle Children's engages with law enforcement, a [policy](https://seattlechildrens.policystat.com/policy/9878240/latest/) has been created to guide workforce members on how and when to appropriately engage law enforcement at Seattle Children's. Over the coming months, our related policies will be updated and our teams will receive training. The official Seattle Children's App is now available in English and Spanish. The app, created by Seattle Children's, helps families quickly connect to MyChart, find and contact services to support their child and family, access our interpreter services, and use turn-by-turn directions to navigate the hospital. Families can download the app today from the Apple App or Google Play stores. When referring your patients to Seattle Children's, please share this information by giving them our [family flyer](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/pdf/PE3473.pdf) about the new app ( [Spanish](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/pdf/PE3473S.pdf) version).
