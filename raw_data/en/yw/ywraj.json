We also offer complementary services, including [medical massage therapy](/massage) and [acupuncture](/acupuncture), which can provide additional benefits to chiropractic patients on the path to wellness. Motion palpation In this helpful diagnostic procedure, we take your joints through their range of motion while we apply a light pressure to feel how things are moving. Joint manipulation Also called a chiropractic adjustment, there are many different forms of joint manipulation, from short, quick thrusts over restricted joints to low- to no-force techniques. Diversified chiropractic technique By applying a short, quick thrust over restricted joints, our goal is to restore normal range of motion, helping to restore spinal alignment and repair joint dysfunction. Thompson technique Using a \"drop table\" to deliver adjustments, this technique offers less forceful adjustments to the spine. Cox technique This gentle, low- or no-force procedure is performed as you lay face-down on a specialized table designed to distract and flex the spine. McKenzie Method This method of assessment and treatment for spinal and extremity pain identifies problematic movement patterns and teaches you appropriate corrective movements. Activator technique Using a small, handheld device, we deliver fast, low force impulses to specific spinal segments, reducing the likelihood of muscles tensing and resisting the adjustment. Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization Based on the thousands-year-old TCM practice of gua sha, IASTM helps dysfunctional tissue reestablish normal tissue and function. Percussive/vibration therapy This massaging device applies rapid bursts of pressure into muscle tissue to loosen up tight muscles. Kinesio taping technique This rehabilitative taping technique helps facilitate the body's natural healing process, while providing support and stability to muscles and joints. Trigger point dry needling This technique involves the insertion of a solid filament needle into a trigger point within a taut band of muscle to reduce contraction. Personalized home care plans We work with our patients to provide individualized therapeutic stretching exercise plans so you can continue your healing journey at home, in between treatments. Orthopedic supplies Depending on your specific needs, we can fit you with a variety of quality orthopedic supplies, including orthotics.
