If you answer \"yes\" to any question, it does not necessarily mean your child should not be vaccinated. It just means additional questions must be asked. If a question is not clear, please ask your healthcare provider to explain it. 1. Is the child sick today? 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kidney or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? 5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told he or she has had intussusception? 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system problems? 8. Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? 9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that weaken their immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had radiation treatments? 10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? 11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? 12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? Immunization Action Coalition 1573 Ave. (mo.) (day) (yr.) Did you bring your child's immunization record card with you? yes no It is important to have a personal record of your child's vaccinations. If you don't have one, ask the child's healthcare provider to give you one with all your child's vaccinations on it. Keep it in a safe place and bring it with you every time you seek medical care for your child. Your child will need this document to enter day care or school, for employment, or for international travel.

Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? [LAIV, MMR, rotavirus, and the intranasal live, at influenza vaccine [LAIV]) are usually contraindicated in immunocompromised children. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR is recommended for asymptomatic HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immunosup - pression. Likewise, varicella vaccine should be considered for HIV-infected children with age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage at 15% or greater and may be considered for children age 8 years and older with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of greater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Immunosuppressed children should not receive LAIV. Infants who have been diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) should not be given a live virus vaccine, including rotavirus (RV) vaccine. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations (4, 5, 6). 9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that weaken their immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had radiation treat - ments? [LAIV, varicella, LAIV) should be postponed until after chemotherapy or long-term high-dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length of time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement (1). To find specific vaccination schedules for stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) patients, see reference 7. LAIV can be given only to healthy non-pregnant individuals age 2-49 years. 10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, MMR, MMRV, varicella) may need to be deferred, depending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations or the cur - rent Red Book for the most current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune globulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines (1, 2). 11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? [LAIV, MMR, LAIV) are contraindicated one month before and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus (1, 6). Sexually active young women who receive a live virus vaccine should be instructed to practice careful contraception for one month following receipt of the vac - cine (5, 8). On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of disease is imminent (e.g., travel to endemic areas) and immediate protection is needed. Use of Td or Tdap is not contra - indicated in pregnancy. At the provider's discretion, either vaccine may be administered during the 2nd or 3rd trimester (9). 12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR, yellow fever] If the child was given either live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks, they should wait 28 days before receiving another vaccination of this type. Inactivated vac - cines may be given at the same time or at any spacing interval. References: 1. CDC. General recommendations on immunization, at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm. 2. AAP.

If so, read the information below. If you want to find out even more, consult the references listed at the bottom of this page. Immunization Action Coalition Item #P4060 p. 2 1. Is the child sick today? [all vaccines] There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events (1, 2). However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute ill - ness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such as otitis media, upper respiratory infections, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines] If a person reports they have an allergy to egg, ask if they can eat lightly cooked eggs (e.g., scrambled eggs). If they can, trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) may be admin - istered. If after eating eggs or egg-containing foods, they have a reaction consisting of only hives, TIV may be given and the person should be observed for at least 30 minutes. If a person experiences a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives and either swelling of the lips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) after eating eggs, do not administer TIV or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). It is possible that they may be eligible to be given TIV, but only after they have seen a physician with expertise in the management of allergic conditions. If a person has ana - phylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer LAIV, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), MMR+varicella (MMRV), or varicella vaccine. A local reaction is not a contraindication. For a table of vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain latex, go to www.cdc. gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/latex-table.pdf. For an extensive table of vaccine components, see reference 3. 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? [all vaccines] History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses (1). His - tory of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP is a contraindication for further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Precautions to DTaP (not Tdap) include the following: (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp episode or collapse within 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous crying for 3 or more hours within 48 hours of a dose, and (d) fever of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of a previous dose. There are other adverse events that might have occurred following vaccination that constitute contraindications or precautions to future doses. Under normal circumstances, vac - cines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kid - ney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? [LAIV] Children with any of the health conditions listed above should not be given the intrana - sal, live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). These children should be vaccinated with the injectable influenza vaccine. 5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV] Children who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be given the live attenuated influenza vaccine. Instead, these children should be given the inactivated influenza vaccine. 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told that he or she has had intussusception? [Rotavirus] Infants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the intestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system [DTaP, in children who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP. An unstable progressive neurolog - ic problem is a precaution to the use of DTaP and Tdap, and a progressive neurologic disorder in a teen is a precaution to the use of Td. For children with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for children with a family history of seizures, vaccinate as usual ( exception: children with a personal or family [i.e., parent or sibling] history of seizures generally should not be vaccinated with MMRV; they should receive separate MMR and VAR vaccines). A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syn - drome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give age-appropriate Tdap instead of Td if no "}
