Hope Through Research The Rethink-ALZ trial is now open to qualifying participants. The trials last for 52 weeks. If you enroll into this trial, you will receive either the oral study drug or placebo twice a day. A placebo looks like the study drug but has no impact on the person taking it. There is no cost to the patient to participate in the Rethink-ALZ trial or for any of the study-related procedures. No hospitalization is required. If you or a loved one are interested in participating in one of these studies, the following criteria must be met: - Be ages 50 to 87 years old. - Be diagnosed with, or have a suspected clinical diagnosis of, Alzheimer's disease. - Have a gradual change in memory for six months or more. - Have a family member or loved one who can be available as a study partner during the entire study. - Be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 or have had a previous COVID-19 infection. Other criteria will apply. Paving a Better Future Agitation associated with Alzheimer's dementia can be difficult to manage and can be very challenging for patients and their loved ones.
