The purpose of the Yellow Card Scheme is to provide early warning that the safety profile of a product requires further investigation. By reporting side effects, everyone can help provide more information on the safety of the vaccines. In addition to a Yellow Card report, NHSE advise that clinical incidents are also reported as described in the [SOP Management of COVID-19 vaccination clinical incidents and enquiries](https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/standard-operating-procedure-management-of-covid-19-vaccination-clinical-incidents-and-enquiries/) to ensure escalation to national level via the National Incident Coordination Centre Single Point of Contact (ICC SPOC). The SOP provides a 'Clinical case escalation framework' algorithm; the fast track incident response (within one hour) pathway subject line should begin 'URGENT: ACTION REQUIRED'. How The [MHRA advise](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-yellow-card-scheme-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals) using one of the following routes: - The [coronavirus Yellow Card site](https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)(preferred route). - The Yellow Card app (download from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&ct=EYC&mt=8)or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob)) (preferred route). - The regular [Yellow Card site](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/)- there is a link to the coronavirus reporting site. - The embedded Yellow Card link in clinical IT systems (EMIS/SystmOne/Vision/MiDatabank). - Patients without online access can call 0800 731 6789 for free. Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm. For suspected adverse reactions use the NHSE [SOP Management of COVID-19 vaccination clinical incidents and enquiries](https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/standard-operating-procedure-management-of-covid-19-vaccination-clinical-incidents-and-enquiries/) to escalate clinical incidents in addition to the Yellow Card scheme. [UK Health Security Agency advise](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-programme-guidance-for-healthcare-practitioners) that any adverse reaction to a vaccine should be documented in the individual's record and their GP should be informed. Who ALL healthcare professionals and members of the public (patients or carers) can make reports. What ALL suspected side effects, even minor effects. The vaccines are new and it is especially important that they are monitored closely and any suspected incidents are quickly reported. [UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) Immunisation Against Infectious Disease (the Green Book)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surveillance-and-monitoring-for-vaccine-safety-the-green-book-chapter-9) states that it is a matter of clinical judgement whether a suspected side effect should be reported or not. Although a reaction might occur in close temporal association with an immunisation, often it can be very difficult to assess whether there is a causal link. If there is any suspicion that the reaction is vaccine-induced, the suspected side effect should be reported. When At any point following administration of the vaccine. This can be immediately after the vaccine is administered or at any time in the following days or weeks. There is no time limit. Side effects can be reported after the first dose, second dose, third dose, booster dose or after all doses if necessary. What to include When reporting side effects to vaccines or medicines patients and healthcare professionals are encouraged to provide as much information as possible, the [MHRA](https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/about) states that the following information should be provided: - Information on the person who has experienced the side effect (essential). - The name of the vaccine suspected to have caused the side effect (essential). Include the vaccine brand and batch/lot number if available. - Whether the side effect is related to the first, second, third or booster dose of the vaccine. - The date of the vaccination(s). - A description of the side effect (essential). - Any other medicines being taken around the same time, including non-prescription and herbal remedies (if available, if not please do not let this prevent you submitting a report). - Any other health condition that the person who experienced the side effect may have (if available, if not please do not let this prevent you submitting a report). Information for patients Section 4 of the recipient information leaflets for the [Pfizer-BioNTech](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19) vaccines state that like all medicines, the vaccines can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. In clinical studies with the vaccine, most side effects were mild to moderate in nature and resolved within a few days with some still present a week after vaccination. Side effects that occurred in clinical trials with COVID-19 vaccines are listed. Patients are advised that if they get any side effects, to talk to their doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes possible side effects not listed in the leaflet. Patients who think they have suffered a side effect are encouraged to report it/them on a Yellow Card. Reporting information can be found at the [coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site](https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Patients should include the vaccine brand and batch/lot number if available, you can find this information under 'Your COVID-19 vaccine record' if you have the NHS app. [UKHSA patient/recipient information](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-what-to-expect-after-vaccination/what-to-expect-after-your-covid-19-vaccination#side-effects) advises recipients what to expect after they have had their primary or booster vaccination.

[VidPrevtyn Beta](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-vidprevtyn-beta)) advise that if side effects such as pain and/or fever are troublesome, medicines containing paracetamol can be taken.
