Medicaments like Procaine mixed with Vitamin B are injected at the acupuncture points or trigger points (autonomic ganglia peripheral nerves, scars, glands, other tissue stimulation points as confirmed by the performing doctor). This form of therapy can be used to relieve a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, cystitis, enlarged prostate, chronic pain plus stiffness in different places. History As mentioned on by JOP Journal Prolotherapy, two German physicians practicing in the early 1900s, Ferdinand and Walter Huneke, are considered the founders of Neural Therapy. Neural Therapy evolved and developed along with the discovery of local anaesthetics. The first local anaesthetic, cocaine, was discovered to have anaesthetic effects by the famous Sigmund Freud. Dr. Freud shared his knowledge with his friend ophthalmologist Koller, who was the first physician to perform eye surgery using a cocaine solution in 1884. Due to the addictive and toxic nature of cocaine, a search for a safer local anaesthetic ensued and resulted in the discovery of procaine. They discovered that procaine used on wounds greatly enhanced healing with longer lasting effects. In 1925, the great French surgeon, Leiche, was the first to successfully treat a migraine headache with a local anaesthetic nerve block injection. He also observed the healing reactions produced by local anaesthetics administered before an operation and at times avoiding the need for that surgery. Leiche called procaine \"the surgeon's bloodless knife.\" In 1925, the brothers Dr. Ferdinand and Walter Huneke, discovered the healing aspects of procaine. This occurred by accident when, in 1925, Ferdinand Huneke gave his nurse, who he had been treating for rheumatism, an infusion of procaine and her previously therapy-resistant migraines disappeared. This \"lightening reaction\" impressed Dr. Huneke and he realized he may have found a new therapy for pain and naming it \"Healing Anaesthetics.\" The Huneke first reported that reaction to the injections could help organs at a distant site and described this phenomenon as a reflex with the publication of \"Unknown Distant Effects of the Local Anaesthesia\". The Hunekes also stated that \"a correctly applied Neural Therapy injection can often instantly and permanently resolve chronic long-standing illness and chronic pain. Although more than one injection is needed in most cases, a \"lightening reaction\" has been noted by researchers and physicians through the years. The effectiveness of Neural Therapy As mentioned above, clear improvements can be noted immediately after Neural Therapy. Although this treatment has many proven results, patients themselves must be ready and willing to do it as not everyone is comfortable with the treatment route (injection). Having said that, for those who are keen, the doctor will advise you on the appropriate treatment pathways and the administration methods of medicaments used. However, keep in mind that the benefits out weights the fear of injections as the treatment has been proven to be highly effective. How is Neural Therapy different from regular acupuncture? In general, acupuncture solely uses needles embedded at the acupuncture point. It focuses on unlocking and curing through the meridian points. However, including the acupuncture principles, Neural Therapy does more with the targeted medicaments used in conjunction. Note that with Neural Therapy, the treating doctor will advise the patients with regards to the suitability of the treatment path, methods and plan. Neural Therapy is one of the most comprehensive complementary solutions for many patients. This is especially for those who suffers from chronic pain. Understanding the treatment and its benefits will open up one's perspective which may be the key to solving a long suffering health issue.
