However, the evidence suggests that a number of 48 HCWs are vaccine -hesitant. This study consists of 65 semi -structured interviews with 49 vaccine providers in Croatia, France, Greece, and Romania to investigate concerns HCWs 50 might have about vaccination. The results revealed that vaccine hesitancy is present in all 51 four countries among vaccine providers. The most important concern across all countries 52 was the fear of vaccine side effects. New vaccines were singled out due to perceived lack of 53 testing for vaccine safety and efficacy. Furthermore, whi le high trust in health authorities was 54 expressed by HCWs, there was also strong mistrust of pharmaceutical companies due to 55 perceived financial interests and lack of communication about side effects. The notion that it 56 is a doctor's responsibility to respond to hesitant patients was reported in all countries. 57 Concerns were also seen to be country - and context -specific. Strategies to improve 58 confidence in vaccines should be adapted to the specific political, social, cultural and 59 economic context of countr ies. Furthermore, while most interventions focus on education 60 and improving information about vaccine safety, effectiveness, or the need for vaccines, 61 concerns raised in this study identify other determinants of hesitancy that need addressing. 62 The representa tiveness of the views of the interviewed HCWs must be interpreted with 63 caution. Th is a qualitativ e study with a small sample size that included geographical areas 64 where vaccination uptake was lower or where hesitancy was more prevalent and it reflects 65 individual participants' beliefs and attitudes toward the topic . As HCWs have the potential of 66 influencing patient vaccination uptake, it is crucial to improve their confidence in vaccination 67 and engage them in activities targeting vaccine hesitancy among their patients. 68 Keywords: Vaccine hesitancy, healthcare workers, patients, Europe 69 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 4 Introduction 70 Healthcare workers (HCWs) are considered the most trusted source of vaccine -related 71 information (1). However , studies are showing that HCWs are losing confidence in 72 vaccination for their children, themselves, or their patients (2-5). Public health experts refer to 73 this loss of confidence as \"vaccine hesitancy\", which has recently been defined by the SAGE 74 Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy as \"a behaviour, influenced by a number of factors 75 including issues of confid ence, complacency, and convenience.\" (6) Vaccine hesitant HCW s 76 can have a powerful influence on vaccination decisions, as they might recommend vaccines 77 less frequently to their patients, and/or otherwise undermine confidence and contribut e to 78 vaccine hesitancy among the general population (2). 79 The little available research on HCWs' attitudes is primarily re lated to seasonal and/or 80 pandemic influenza vaccines . Most found that HCWs had not taken the influenza vaccine 81 because of lack of time (7, 8), not feeling at risk of influenza (9, 10), because they 82 considered they had no med ical indication for the vaccine (4, 5), or due to concerns about 83 safety and efficacy (3, 11). 84 This research aims to better understand vaccine hesitancy among vaccine providers in 85 Europe , and explore the nature of their concerns, their perceptions of vaccine -related 86 information, and the ir perceived role in responding to vaccine hesitancy . 87 88 Methods 89 The study was conducted in Croatia, France, Greece and Romania, as these countries 90 responded to ECDC's call for interest in participating in the project entitled \"Comprehensive 91 expert opinion on motivating hesitant population groups to vaccinate\". These co untries have 92 very different socio -economic and political backgrounds, allowing a more comprehensive 93 overview of vaccine hesitancy in various contexts. Semi-structured interviews were 94 conducted with healthcare providers who advise on vaccination for children , pregnant 95 women and adults and who were working in one of the selected countries at the time of 96 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 5 study . Healthcare professionals who only administer the vaccine, after the patient has 97 already decided to receive it, were not included . Recruitment o f participants was done to 98 include vaccine providers that are either vaccine hesitant or that face vaccine hesitancy in 99 their practice. The aim was to build a sample of the general population of vaccine providers 100 in each country to understand what their co ncerns about vaccines might be and how they 101 respond to patient hesitancy. Areas with known vaccine hesitancy or low vaccination 102 coverage were purposively favoured to increase the likelihood of recruiting healthcare 103 workers either facing hesitancy or being hesitant themselves. The aim was not to determine 104 levels of hesitancy in healthcare workers. Due to varying quality and quantity of data 105 available on vaccination coverage rates and vaccine hesitancy in the different countries, 106 different sampling methods we re used in each country. In Croatia and Romania , the 107 assumption that vaccine hesitancy exists across the whole country was used to select 108 participants as there was no available data on specific levels of hesitancy in different regions 109 and populations . In France, MMR vaccine coverage rates were used as a proxy for vaccine 110 hesitancy. In Greece, this was done by using snowball sampling and first contacting two 111 vaccine hesitancy vaccine providers. Based on the time and budget available for the study, 112 and recommended sampling strategies for qualitative research, e ach country was asked to 113 recruit approximately 15 HCWs, selected purposively. 114 A 30-minute interview guide, with a consent form and information sheet , was sent to country 115 teams for translation and a daptation. The questi ons, which were not piloted due to time 116 constraints, were designed to be neutral (i.e. \"Have you ever had a patient who was hesitant 117 or opposed to get himself/herself or his/her children vaccinate d?\", \"Do you think that some 118 vaccines which are officially recommended are not necessary?\") . Face -to-face i nterviews 119 were conducted at a location chosen by the participant , recorded with their approval , and 120 transcribed removing identifiers such as names and locations using an automated 121 programme or manually where software was not available . Interviewers in all countries were 122 trained experienced researchers in qualitative interviewing. 123 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 6 Sampling methods 124 Different sampling strategies were used in different countries. In Croatia, a snowball 125 sampling technique was used to select participants. Vaccination is provided in Croatia by 126 family doctors, paediatricians, specialist doctors, and epidemiologists. F ifty general 127 practitioners (GPs) and ten epidemiologists from areas with vaccine hesitancy were 128 identified from the main general practitioner networks and through the Epidemiological 129 Society and contacted by mail or telephone. Thirteen GPs and four epidemi ologists agreed 130 to participate. 131 In France, Montpellier and two surrounding villages (Ganges and Le Vigan) were chosen for 132 this study due to low vaccine coverage. GPs are responsible for 90% of vaccination while 133 other physicians such as paediatricians and gynaecologists vaccinate some target 134 populations. GPs and gynaecologists were arbitrarily selected using a telephone directory 135 and 142 were contacted through a telephone survey platform. Fourteen vaccine providers 136 agreed to participate . Eight participants came from an area with <55% MMR vaccine 137 coverage rates (first dose), three from a 55 -75% coverage rate area and five from a 75 -80% 138 coverage rate area. 139 In Greece, a snowball methodology was employed as vaccination is mostly carried out 140 privately by doctors and GPs and they are not connected to a national database recording 141 vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy . Two persons who self-identified as being 142 vaccine -hesitant - one GP, one paediatrician - were starting points and led to the 143 identification of an additional 19 contacts from their social networks . Six vaccine providers 144 refused to participate in the study and 15 interviews were conducted. 145 In Romania, vaccines are either administered by maternity services , paediatricians or by 146 family doctors who wo rk under the supervision of the National Institute of Public Health, part 147 of the Ministry of Health. The presidents of Family Doctors Associations in various districts 148 were contacted with information about the study and asked to share the contact details o f 149 several GPs and/or paediatricians . Twenty -three HCWs were contacted via phone and six 150 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 7 refused to participate . At the end of each interview, physicians were asked to refer other 151 vaccine providers who might be interested to participate in the study. 152 Data analysi s 153 The Vaccine Confidence Project used a deductive approach, based on a comprehensive 154 literature review, to develop a standardised coding scheme. C ountry teams reviewed the 155 scheme and coded the interviews, adding a dditional codes where needed. Country analyses 156 were translated into English to allow comparison across the four countries and sent back to 157 the Vaccine Confidence Project for overall analysis . 158 Ethics 159 Ethical approval was obtained from LSHTM Research Ethics Committee, as well as the 160 Croatian and Romanian ethics committees. No ethics approvals were required in France or 161 Greece. 162 163 Results 164 Sixty -five semi -structured interviews were conducted across Croatia (17 /65), France (16 /65), 165 Greece (15 /65) and Romania (17 /65). Most participants were female (66%) and between 25- 166 44 years old (58%). The majority were with gynaecologists medicine specia lists (6%) also 168 participating (Table 1). 169 170 Table 1: Participants characteristics (n (%)) 171 Croatia France Greece Romania Total Number of participants 17 16 15 17 65 Age 25-44yo: 17 (100%) Sex Females: 15 (88%) Males : Females : 8 (50%) Males : Females : 4 (27% ) Males : Females : 16 (94%) Males : Females : 43 (66%) Males : Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 8 2 (12%) 8 (50%) 11 (73%) 1 (6%) 22 4 (6% ) Internal medicine : 4 (6%) Average years of practice (range) 5 (1-11) 21 (4 -39) 18 (2 -35) 17 (2 -31) 16 (1 -39) Type of practice Solo: 13 (76%) Group : 4 (24%) Solo: 9 (56%) Group : 7 (44%) Solo: 11 Group : 2 (13%) Other : (13%) Solo: 14 (82%) Group : 3 (18%) Solo: 47 Group : 16 (25%) Other : 2 (3%) Number of HCWs practicing alternative medicine ** 0 (0%) 1 (6%) 0 (0%) 3 (18%) 4 (6%) * The age categories used in the baseline questionnaires in Romania were different from the ones used in other 172 countries 173 **Alternative medicine was defined as practicing one or more of these activities at work: acupuncture, 174 homeopathy, anthroposophy, natural medicine 175 176 The coding t hemes identified across all countries included: perceived benefits of vaccination 177 (mentioned 227 times across all interviews - more than one mention per interview is 178 possible) , issues with vaccination (201) , role of HCWs in responding to patient hesitancy 179 (197), trust issues (139) , suggestions to improve vaccine confidence (127) , quali ty of 180 information and communication (120) , and decision -making influences (115) . 181 HCWs in all four countries identified the following benefits of vaccination: benefits outweigh 182 risks Greece(G) =8; Romania(R) =13), vaccines 183 prevent dangerous diseases and current outbreaks constitute the best example of the 184 dangers of not vaccinating ( C=16 ;F=10 ; G=8;R=10 ). One HCW in Romania explained : 185 \"Vaccines have been used for a long time now (...). They have achieved their purpose : to 186 prevent disease, to maintain health status, and to stop recurrence of diseases that have life - 187 long sequelae\" (R6). Many HCWs , particularly in France, Romania and Croatia also 188 emphasised the benefit of herd immunity (C=15 ; F=11; G=2; R=10) , and the responsibility 189 people ( including doctors) have to protect the entire society . As one French participant 190 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 9 noted, \"I consider that those people who refuse vaccination are selfish because they take 191 advantage of the vaccination of other people \" (F1) . A large nu mber of HCWs in Romania 192 and Croatia supported vaccination due to the existence of good scientific evidence ( C=15 ; 193 F=3; G=4; R=10 ). 194 Concerns about the safety of vaccination was the most recurrent theme in Romania and in 195 Greece , and was raised by a small number of HCWs in France and Croatia , with some 196 reporting patients' perceptions of risks. The most common concern reported, particularly in 197 Greece and Romania was about s ide effects (C=5 ; F=3; G=9; R=14), including feelings of 198 guilt if patients were to suffer from vaccine adverse events. A few HCWs had severe worries , 199 as one from Romania concluded, \"It's well known that there are vaccines that have been 200 banned in other countries (e.g., anti -hepatitis), pr ecisely because they were proven to cause 201 multiple sclerosis. (...) HPV vaccines can lead to tumours and autism. It's outrageous that 202 they are prescribed\" (R9) . Concerns that new vaccines , such as HPV, might not have been 203 tested long enough were also raised. Issues of low vaccine effectiveness, or beliefs that 204 vaccines (i.e. influenza) do not always work were particularly common in Greece , which 205 sometimes led HCWs t o avoid recommending vaccines (C=2 ; F=4; G=10; R=4). One noted, 206 \"I recommend some vaccines at a later stage than what is recommended to avoid over - 207 stimulating their immune system \" (G11). Many HCWs in Romania and Greece also 208 mentioned that there might be too many vaccines ( C=1;F=2;G=11;R=5 ) given to children at 209 a very young age ( C=1;F=3;G=6;R=2 ), wh ich led some interviewed doctors to follow their 210 own vaccination plans in Greece. 211 Trust issues were raised in Greece, Romania, and Croatia and to a lesser extent in France. 212 In Croatia, France and Romania, the majority of these positively referred to trust in the 213 government, health authorities, doctors or research ( C=17;F=8;G=6;R=12 ), and in 214 vaccination ( C=17;F=4;G=5;R=11 ). In Croatia and Greece, trust in information received by 215 HCWs from various sources was also observed . Mistrust was ext remely prevalent in Greece , 216 especially towards pharmaceutical companies (C=2;F=4;G=11;R=7 ). Interviewed HCWs in 217 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 10 all countries believed pharmaceutical companies have financial interests, put pressure on 218 HCWs, and do not provide sufficient information about side effects. A mistrust of health 219 authorities (C=0;F=3;G=9;R=4) and information about vaccination (C=0;F=3;G=7;R=6) was 220 also observed among some of the interviewed French, Romanian and Greek HCWs . One 221 Greek respondent commented, \"I do not trust the Greek Ministry of Health and rightly so. 222 Many patients do not trust them either .\" (G12) . 223 HCWs in Croatia and Romania were particularly pleased with the quantity and quality of 224 information they receive or give to patients through leaflets, posters, books or webs ites 225 (C=13;F=1;G=3;R=11 ). However, other HCWs in Romania and in Greece also reported a 226 lack of information about safety and the risks of receiving too many vaccines to allow 227 patients to make an informed decision ( C=4; F=2; G=8; R=7). A few Romania (C=0 , F=0, G=4, R=3) were also entirely against vaccination, two of which also 229 mentioned a preference for homeopathy or prescribing natural remedies. \"I do not like 230 vaccines! I tell my patients that I've never vaccinated myself with any vaccine .\"(R1). 231 HCWs in Romania, Greece and France, and to a lesser extent in Croatia, discussed ways 232 they and their patients are influenced when making decisions about vaccination. HCWs in all 233 countries reported being influenced by their employers or health authorities in terms of 234 vaccination schedules or reminders (C=11 ; F=9; G=4; R=10). Influences by pharmaceutical 235 representatives who remind HCWs of vaccination schedules were mostly discussed in 236 France ( C=0; F=12; G=0; R=2), where mistrust in pharmaceutical companies was not 237 reported as much as in other countries . One French HCW commented, \"Pharmaceutical 238 drug representatives visit me; they explain to me how vaccines work, why a vaccine more 239 than another... \" (F6), while another expressed some distrust. \" I listen to (pharmaceutical) 240 companies but do not trust them \" (F5). This shows that HCWs in France receive visits by 241 pharmaceutical representatives and use the information they provide, but do not necessarily 242 trust them . Influence s from patient experiences (i.e. observing a lack of vaccine side effects 243 or infections with vaccine -preventable diseases) were reported in Greece and Romania . 244 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 11 Other influences mentioned were training courses, the media, online information, and 245 medical exp erts and journals. Some HCWs in Greece and Romania believed that their 246 patients were influenced by the media ( C=0;F=1;G=3;R=13 ), HCWs ( ( C=0;F=0;G=3;R=1 ). HCWs in Romania discussed the 248 negative, unverified and sometimes contradictory information available online which is 249 sometime s more persuasive than doctors : \"With the increasing popularity of the Internet, 250 many parents are misinformed by charlatans and crooks that \"seduce\" them with false and 251 absurd information. (...) If some doctors were fooled by such misinformation, then parents 252 (...) are very vulnerable to such poisoning .\"(R5) 253 HCWs in all countries discussed their role in responding to patient hesitancy. In Croatia, 254 Greece and Romania, HCWs mostl y believed that it is their role to address and respond to 255 patient hesitancy (C=17; F=4; G=13; R=11 ) by sharing \" accurate and reliable information in 256 a way that they can understand \" (C3). Some HCWs in Croatia, France and Romania, went 257 one step further and explained they have to try to influence patients' decision -making 258 regarding vaccination by emotionally affecting them (i.e. showing them images of 259 polio myelitis cases ), telling them they vaccinate their own children, or telling them 260 vaccination is mandator y (C=10 ; F=6; G=3; R=10): \"I say it is mandatory even if it is not... 261 (...) I don't want to follow a child, a family who do not vaccinate their children\" (F16). Some 262 HCWs, mostly in France, believed they should only provide neutral facts and information 263 about vaccination, without trying to influence or force patients to vaccinate ( C=1; F=10; G=3; 264 R=4). 265 Overall, across all countries, HCWs came up with four major suggestions to improve 266 vaccination confidence : improve information , involve health authorities, ensure skilled 267 communication between HCWs and patients , and improve HCW training . 268 Discussion 269 The results from the qualitative interviews with HCWs from Croatia, France, Greece and 270 Romania confirm the study's initial assumption of existence of vaccine hesitancy among 271 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 12 HCWs and provide an insight into the reasons behind these doubts. Although the reports 272 from the interviews were overall positive and showed generally high levels of trust and 273 confidence in vaccination, there were also concerns about safety, question s about the need 274 for vaccines, and/or mistrust of pharmaceutical companie s and health authorities. A few 275 doctors, some practicing homeopathy, were entirely against vaccination, and actively 276 decided not to recommend it to their patients. This is of particular concern as many studies 277 have shown that the attitude and knowledge HCW s have about vaccines can influence their 278 intention s to vaccinate themselves and their children, and to recommend vaccination to their 279 patients (12, 13). It is therefore highly important for public health leaders to find way s to 280 better understand HCW vaccine -related behaviours and attitudes and take steps to counter 281 hesitancy. 282 The most important concern across all countries was about vaccine safety . Most HCWs 283 reported these as concerns their patients have, but some shared similar worries. Many 284 studies have found that HCWs refuse vaccination because of the risk of side effects (11), but 285 also because they think they are at low risk of infection (15, 16). The latter was also 286 observed in this study, with HCWs lacking confidence in the need for and the effectiveness 287 of some vaccines, particul arly the seasonal influenza one . HCWs have their patients' health 288 at heart, and it important that they are reminded of the dangers of vaccine -preventable 289 diseases and the low risks of vaccine side effects. 290 New vaccines, such as the HPV vaccine, were singled out due to perceived lack of testing 291 for vaccine safety and efficacy. This confirm s previously conducted studies which also 292 showed HCWs' concerns about new vaccines (17, 18). The HPV vaccine is of particular 293 concern, as it is delivered by different HCWs in different countries. Making sure all vaccine 294 providers (nurses, gynaecologists, GPs, etc.) are included in the planning and deployment of 295 new vaccination campaign will alleviate their doubts and concerns, improve their knowledge 296 about the vaccine, and facilitate their recommendation to patients. 297 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 13 Another important theme which came across the interviews was trust . A 2015 French study 298 found that eight out of ten GPs trust the Ministry of Health but 50% of them also believe that 299 the Ministry i s influenc ed by pharmaceutical companies (19). A similar scenario was found in 300 this study , with high trust expressed in the health authorities but mistrust of pharmaceutical 301 companies. Interviewed HCWs in Greece also showed high mistrust of the government and 302 health system , which could have been influenced by the political and economic crisis 303 situation in which the interviews were conducted and may require intervention s to avoid 304 negative impact on vaccination uptake. This result demonstrates the importance of context in 305 vaccine hesitancy, and highlights the need for more cross -cutting research looking into the 306 impact of political, socio -economic and cultural contexts on concerns about vaccination. 307 Many institutions can be associated with vaccination and t he public's credibility of vaccine 308 information will be influenced by their trust in some or all of these organisations and how 309 open and transparent these are. Trust can be built by expressing empathy and 310 acknowledging p eople's concerns and feelings and depends on the specific social, cultural, 311 political and economic context of the country or region affected. 312 HCWs stressed the issue of anti -vaccination content in the media and its influence on 313 patients. With continuous a dvancements in communication technologies such as social 314 media, the public is increasingly using the internet to research and share information about 315 vaccines. Some studies have analysed the content of vaccine information available on 316 websites and social m edia and have shown not only that it is of variable quality, but also that 317 there is a predominance of negative and sometimes incorrect content, which has the 318 potential to influence vaccine decisions (21-24). However, a study looking particularly at 319 French websites found that while some websites criticise some aspects of vaccines, not all 320 disseminate anti -vaccination opinions (25). National authorities and governments should 321 consider taking advantage of what online media, including social media, ha ve to offer by 322 promoting and sharing clear, concise and easy to understand information about vaccination. 323 Increasing the presence of reliable sources of information online will allow countries to 324 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 14 counter act anti -vaccine groups and prevent them from reaching parents seeking more 325 information about vaccines on the internet. 326 Many interviewed vaccine providers fel t it was their responsib ility to respond to hesitant 327 patients , with some believ ing they should do even more and try to actively influence patients 328 to ensure they get vaccinated. However, in France, most study participants described their 329 role as providers of neutral information, explaining patients should make that decision for 330 themselves. HCWs are often seen as having the greatest influence on patients' deci sion to 331 get vaccinated. It is therefore important they not only communicate with hesitant patients, but 332 that they know how to respond to concerns or doubts. A study from 2011 concluded that 333 HCWs should aim to have open, non -confrontational dialogues with p atients as early as 334 possible. It recommended using personal stories, reports of disease outbreaks and visual 335 images of individuals suffering from vaccine -preventable diseases to remind patients of the 336 need for high vaccination coverage (26). 337 This study shed s light on current knowledge gaps that future research could explore further 338 such as varying opinions about vaccination among different types of vaccine providers, but 339 also in relation to different vaccines. The wide range of concerns raised related to vacc ine 340 hesitancy points to the need for more comprehensive, context -specif ic intervention s. While 341 most current interventions focus on education and improving information about vaccine 342 safety, effectiveness, or the need for vaccines , concerns raised in this st udy identify other 343 determinants of hesitancy that need addressing , such as trust in health systems, or HCWs' 344 perceived roles in responding to patient hesitancy and their levels of confidence in doing so . 345 Although some commonalities between countries can be found, determinants of hesitancy 346 have also been shown to be country - and context -specific and need to be addressed as 347 such. National vaccination programmes should consider develop ing the capacity of 348 identifying local determinants of vaccine hesitancy, whether in pat ients or in healthcare 349 workers and then develop ing strategies adapted to address these determinants, in a social, 350 cultural, political and economic context. 351 Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Europe: A qualitative study 15 352 Limitations 353 There were a few limitations in this research. The first is the limited sample size and 354 differential sampling strategy in each countr y which may have affected the reliability of the 355 study. Recruitment of HCWs was also intentionally biased as it was done in geographical 356 areas where vaccination uptake was lower than average or where hesitancy was reported to 357 be more prevalent. Results for Greece must also be interpreted with caution as it was the 358 only country were vaccine hesitant providers were directly recruited through sn owball 359 sampling. The representativeness of the views of the HCWs interviewed in this study must 360 be interpreted with caution , especially as they come from different healthcare systems, with 361 different approaches to vaccine provision . That said, the study's i ntent was to start 362 identifying the characteristics and experience of hesitancy among HCWs where vaccine 363 hesitancy and low vaccine uptake was known rather than quantify vaccine hesitancy . HCWs 364 from different countries might also have answered questions diff erently, due to the influence 365 of vaccination legislation in their country, which might have led to underreporting of some 366 perceived issues. Fear of reprisal might have also deterred some HCWs from sharing their 367 concerns about vaccination. 368 369 370 Appendix 371 Topic guide for the semi -structured interviews 372 BASELINE INFORMATION 373 374 1.
