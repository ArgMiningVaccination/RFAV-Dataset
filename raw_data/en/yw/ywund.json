This year's conference theme\u2014Sex, Drugs, and Rock & Roll\u2014may have raised a few eyebrows at first. Why did we choose this theme? Why be so public about complicated, personal, often embarrassing issues? Because fighting in the open has been the mission of MHA since Clifford Beers dared to utter his now famous words: \"I must fight in the open. \" So, that's what we're doing. These issues are real\u2014across all age groups\u2014and are far from black and white. It is time to take mental health, mental illness, and addiction\u2014and all the messy and sometimes uneasy truths that accompany them\u2014out from behind closed doors, and discuss them openly. So, over the next few days we will have clear, real, and direct conversations about issues that impact many in the mental health and addiction communities every day\u2014sexual trauma and its aftermath, sexual addiction, sex and gender, intimacy issues, and sexual and other side effects of mental illness medication. We will talk about how we can address them effectively to promote hope and recovery. We'll dive into topics surrounding the opioid epidemic, self-medicating, and addiction. And we will talk about how people are overcoming alcohol and drug dependence and successfully finding pathways to resilience and recovery. We'll hear from musicians and entertainers about their own personal battles related to mental illnesses and substance use disorders. And we will talk about how music, musicians, artists and entertainers are playing a major role in helping peers and fans along their own paths to recovery. At this conference and every day, we continue to be guided by the Before Stage 4 (B4Stage4) philosophy--that mental health conditions should be treated long before they reach the most critical points in the disease process. MHA's work is driven by our commitment to promote mental health as a critical part of overall wellness, including prevention for all, early identification and intervention for those at risk, integrated health, behavioral health and other services for those who need them, and recovery as a goal. Thank you for joining us!

Moderator: Danielle Fritze, Mental Health America BREAKOUT SESSIONS 10:45 am - 12:15 pm Innovation in Suicide Prevention Research and Practice with LGBTQ Youth Capitol A Sexual and gender minorities were recently designated as an NIH research health disparity population. Given the sensitive nature of research with LGBTQ communities, especially youth, a strong research and practice partnership is necessary. Over the last decade, the partnership between the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Columbia University has resulted in benchmark findings on the effectiveness of crisis intervention for a general population of adults. Their research does not, however, ask the sexual orientation or gender identity of callers, nor does it include participants under 18 years of age. In 2015, The Trevor Project, the leading national suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youth and young adults under 25, began its partnership with USC researchers to seek to fill this void in knowledge. This session will present the findings of this research, a multi-year study in which a diverse set of youth (12-24 years old) reported on their experiences with crisis services, suicidality, mental health characteristics, lifetime experiences of LGBTQ-related stress, and sources of resilience. Speakers: David Bond, LCSW, The Trevor Project; Jeremy Goldbach, PhD, LMSW, USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work.

Moderator: Theresa Nguyen, Mental Health America 2017 MHA Annual Conference Onsite Guide - DANIELLE ONLY.indd 23 5/26/2017 11:37:14 AM23Very Special K - A Little Goes a Long Way Capitol B The anesthetic drug ketamine has been investigated for its anti-depressant effects in people suffering from treatment-resistant depression since the 1990s. Although the mechanism of action remains uncertain, ketamine is thought to act on the glutamate neurotransmitter system to ultimately initiate positive structural brain changes that outlast the metabolism of the drug. This session will provide a review of the results of the two-year ketamine program at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care organization. Additionally, participants will learn about the specialized role of psychotherapy for patients receiving the treatment, as clinical experience indicates an enhancement of learning and application of psychotherapeutic principles during and after ketamine therapy. Finally, a person who has received the treatment will share her experiences with ketamine and how the treatment has influenced the course of her chronic depression and positively affected her life. Speakers: Dr. Mason Turner, Loretta Wilson, MSN, RN, and Anne McNealis, Kaiser Permanente, San Francisco Medical Center. Moderator: Ben Harrington, MHA of East Tennessee Song of Compassion: Supporting Musicians and Access to Care Congressional C/D Musicians and those around them are a unique population who oftentimes use their feelings and emotions to create art and to express those feelings on stage. Yet many hesitate to seek help when they are troubled\u2014be it because of stigma, financial resources, or access to care. This session will discuss how suicide has stolen the lives of many musicians, artists, and non-mainstream individuals, while mainstream suicide prevention initiatives have yet to seriously address this subset of people. Session attendees will learn how growth in mental health awareness, education and prevention can be achieved when factoring in the unique attributes of specific populations like professional musicians. Presenters will share personal narratives of lived experience of suicide loss, and about how musicians' communities are not only negatively impacted by loss and mental illness, but how positive change can grow from supportive systems put in place. Speakers: Kate Hardy, Amelia Lehto, and Thomas Camilleri, Six Feet Over.

Case examples will be provided to help aid understanding of the issue, including how a clinician can treat compulsive sexual behavior even when the environment that surrounds them is triggering. Speaker: Jennifer Weeks, PhD, LPC, CAADC, CSAT-S, Sexual Addiction Treatment Services. Moderator: Sachin Doshi, Mental Health America Mental Illness Within the Family Capitol B In this session, presenters will address substance use and mental illness specifically as it pertained, and continues to pertain, to them and their immediate family members.

Speaker: Reverend Vanessa Wilson, JD, Magnolia Road United Methodist Church. Moderator: Caren Howard, Mental Health America Power of Songwriting Yellowstone/Everglades Men tal illness may make us feel as though we've lost our voice, our innate ability to trust ourselves, to express ourselves, and make decisions. Through songwriting, many believe we can literally reclaim our voice, and reshape our identity as we place our thoughts, feelings and sensations into a structured musical form. This session will discuss songwriting tools that can help mold your own experience into music and rhyme. Participants will understand the psychological benefits of songwriting and its impact on the left and right sides of the brain. Attendees will also be able to combine their own life experience with the practical songwriting tools to create a structure for their own original song.

The program assists these individuals in transitioning from jails or mental health facilities to having their own home. Priority is given to those who are exiting institutions such as a state-run or contracted psychiatric facility, nursing facilities, correctional facilities, or individuals who are homeless/chronically homeless. Services are short term and are typically offered up to three months for transitional supports. The program serves 50 people annually and assists these individuals with getting their lives back on track. All individuals must apply for Social Security and Medicaid prior to applying to the program. The program is funded by a state contract from the Office of Behavioral Health. MHA of Maryland The Consumer Quality Team (CQT) of Maryland is a consumer-run program dedicated to partnering with mental health providers and consumers. The objective of the program is to bring consumers' ideas and needs to the people who have the power to resolve problems and implement change in real time. The program serves public mental health facilities that serve children, adolescents, and adults. CQT works to ensure that Marylanders receive the services they need to facilitate their recovery. The CQT team-staffed entirely by consumers and family members-conducts interviews with behavioral health consumers and shares their feedback and suggestions with program and state leadership to improve services provided through the state's public behavioral health system. In the 2015/2016 year, CQT interviewed 1,638 people during 390 site visits. CQT is funded by Federal Block Grants and the state of Maryland. MHA of New Y ork City MHA-NYC is the first organization in the country to offer evi-dence-based online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with live telephone, text, and chat supports. MHA-NYC, in part - nership with Magellan Health, offers a suite of targeted CBT programs-- free, confidential, evidence-based online services that provides effective treatment for anxiety, depression, OCD, substance abuse, and insomnia--complemented by live phone chat and text support, that can be made available to individ-uals anytime and anywhere there is Internet access. In 2016, over 4,000 New Yorkers who were still experiencing emotional distress following Superstorm Sandy accessed the programs through iHelp New York. With this innovative program, MHA-NYC not only tackled the problems of delays in access to care but also the shortage of clinicians trained to deliver CBT for a range of common behavioral health conditions.MHA of East TennesseeThe Peer Recovery Call Center helps those who struggle with mental illness or substance abuse. All calls are answered by peers, people who have firsthand experience with mental illness and/or substance abuse. In its fourth year, this innovative program merged the old-time information and referral service with peer support with spectacular results. Clients are ecstatic to find they are not alone and that others experience same diagnoses or problems, yet are stunned that someone cares to call them back. Significantly, more than 70 percent of clients in this hybrid Peer Recovery Call Center model enter treatment and follow through with their treatment and recovery plan (double the national average). The Peer Recovery Call Center also installed the CallPoint management information system. CallPoint is the sister product of HMIS (Homeless Management Information System) and provides client-level data, including a system services directory and HIPAA-compliant client level referral record, follow up peer support call back notifications for call center staff, and Milestone of Recovery Scale (MORS) assessment. MHA of Middle Tennessee Tennessee's statewide Zero Suicide Initiative, by way of the Zero Suicide Initiative Task Force, is working to implement the concept of \"zero suicides\" within behavioral health and substance use treatment settings across Tennessee. Members of the Task Force, in concert with the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (TDMHSAS) and the Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network (TSPN), in which MHA of Middle Tennessee has administrative oversight, work with behavioral health facilities in the state to develop top-down action plans to incorporate best-practice suicide prevention and intervention strategies. The objective of this Initiative is not merely the reduction of suicides and suicide attempts within each agency's client base but to eliminate suicide deaths entirely.
