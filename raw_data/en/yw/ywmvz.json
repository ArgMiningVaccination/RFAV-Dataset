[Psoriasis](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/psoriasis/default.aspx) is a chronic disease on the skin due to a disturbed immune system. In psoriasis, the skin produces an excessive and abnormal amount of skin scales. Normally, skin cells tend to develop deep in one's skin and rise to the surface gradually. Each skin cell has a lifecycle of about one month. However, in psoriasis-affected individuals, the skin production process takes place rapidly and overproduction of skin cells occurs leading to patchy, scaly skin. Psoriasis is characterized by red, raised, scaly skin patches on the skin's surface. Usually, whitish-silver scales happen to develop in red, thick skin patches. At times, cracks may develop in the patches which may bleed. However, psoriasis is not contagious and its lesions are not infectious. Common Areas of The Body That are Affected by Psoriasis: Most often, scales of psoriasis develop on the joints, such as knees and elbows. About 15% of psoriasis-affected individuals have psoriasis causing inflammation of the joints and leading to symptoms of arthritis. However, psoriasis can affect any area of your body. Patches of psoriasis may occur on your scalp, neck, hands, palms, face, lower back, soles of the feet, or any other body part. A less common type of this skin disorder may also affect your nails, such as toenails and fingernails, the area around the genitals, and soft tissues within your mouth. (See pictures where psoriasis affects the back, thighs, legs, area behind the ears, nails, and margins of hair. Most common psoriasis-affected areas are the elbows and knees.) [Ask your questions to Dr. Shah's team directly & get an expert opinion on your ailment!](https://www.askdrshah.com/askyourquestionpage.aspx) Grades of Psoriasis: Based on the percentage of the psoriasis-affected body area and its impact on the quality of life, psoriasis is graded as severe, moderate, or mild. The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is an index parameter that helps express how severe the psoriasis is. It comprises three clinical signs, namely erythema (i.e. redness), induration (i.e. thickness), and desquamation (i.e. scaling). The severity of the psoriasis parameter is calculated on a scale of 0 to 4. The Occurrence of Psoriasis: Psoriasis tends to appear and disappear with medicines or without medicines. Such phases are called Remissions and Relapses. At times, the patches of psoriasis vanish (which is called remission), while, in some instances, the patches reappear (which is called a relapse). Longer remissions and minimum and shorter relapses give great relief to psoriasis in an affected individual. Factors Affecting Psoriasis: Certain factors can trigger a flare-up making the psoriasis patches reappear in a short time span. Factors, such as stress, skin injuries, infections, medications, climate, obesity, tobacco, genetic factors, and alcohol, are some common psoriasis causes that you should watch out for. On the contrary, certain factors, such as sunlight, tend to alleviate the discomfort and intensity of psoriasis. How Commonly Psoriasis Occur? Usually, 1% -2% of the general population is affected by this chronic skin condition. Psoriasis occurs in both males as well as females in equal proportions. An individual can get affected by psoriasis at any age, however, most often, psoriasis occurs in grown-ups between the age groups of 15 and 35 years. Psoriasis can affect children as young as one-year-old babies. How does Psoriasis Affect our Body? The skin comprises two layers, such as an inner layer (called the dermis) and an outer layer (called the epidermis). Skin cells that make up the upper layer grow in the inner layer and then move upwards. New cells developed in the dermis replace the old cells of the epidermis at a typical interval of 28 to 30 days. However, in psoriasis, the cell formation process in the inner layer is accelerated. So, a greater number of new cells are formed in the inner layer and they move upwards to the upper layer at a faster rate than normal. As a result, excess skin cells conglomerates lead to scales and patches of psoriasis.

Causes of Psoriasis: Even though the exact cause of psoriasis is not yet clear, it is known to develop due to the body's internal disharmony and certain environmental triggers. Psoriasis causes include genetic predisposition and disturbed immunity. Certain internal and external factors also cause psoriasis. Internal Factors: - Defective/Disturbed Immune System: The latest medical research reveals that psoriasis results due to a disturbed or defective immune system. An overactive immune system tends to create inflammation in your body. It produces excessive healthy skin cells, and they are pushed to the upper surface of the skin quite quickly resulting in psoriasis. - Genetics & Heredity: Some of the most prominent psoriasis causes are genetic and hereditary factors. One out of every 3 individuals affected by psoriasis happens to have a relative suffering from psoriasis. External Factors: Psoriasis-affected individuals may experience that at certain times their skin condition and discomfort turn worse. Certain factors or conditions that cause relapses or flare-ups of psoriasis are called triggers of psoriasis. Some of them are mentioned below. - Climate: Often, the onset of the cold climate can trigger a flare-up of psoriasis. On the contrary, hot and sunny weather can provide relief from this skin condition. - Skin Injury: Physical trauma, such as skin injuries due to an accident, scrape, sunburn, or cut, can cause psoriasis. Psoriatic lesions may occur at the site of skin injury after 10 to 14 days of the injury. Also, vaccines and shots can cause an outbreak of psoriasis. - Infections: Psoriasis causes also include skin infections and systemic (integral) infections. Upper respiratory infection, HIV infection, and strep throat are some of the common systemic infections that may make you suffer from psoriasis or trigger a flare-up of the same. Besides these, skin infections causing boils and ulcers can also trigger psoriasis lesions. - Stress: Another common factor that can be the cause, as well as the trigger of psoriasis, is stress. Psychological stress affects both the mind and body of an individual. So, unusually intense stress can trigger a relapse of psoriasis. To prevent the flare-ups of this skin condition, you need to learn to manage and minimize the stress. - Certain Medications: Lithium or medications which treat depression, beta-blockers that regulate high blood pressure, mepacrine, antimalarials, and NSAID can lead to psoriasis or trigger relapse of a psoriasis flare-up. Symptoms of Psoriasis: Psoriasis usually occurs starting with small, red bumps on the surface of the skin which progress to larger, scaly psoriasis patches. Some of the common symptoms of this skin condition are as follows: - Red, inflamed and raised skin patches - Burning and itching affecting the psoriasis lesions - A white crust of silvery scales surfacing the red patches - Soreness is present around the lesions - Dry skin which may crack or even bleed - Swollen and painful joints - Thick, pitted nails Types of Psoriasis: There are several variants of psoriasis. Some of the common types of psoriasis are as below. - Plaque psoriasis: The most common type of psoriasis which is observed in the majority of psoriasis patients is plaque psoriasis or psoriasis vulgaris. It results in red, raised, inflamed, and thickened patches of red skin, which are often covered with whitish-silver plaques. You can find these plaques on the knees, elbows, and scalp. - Scalp Psoriasis: Another common type of psoriasis is scalp psoriasis, which is relatively quite difficult to treat. You may have it only on your scalp or together on your scalp and skin. In several cases of scalp psoriasis, it lasts for many years before it affects the body. Most often, mild psoriasis which affects the scalp is inappropriately identified and treated as dandruff. - Pustular Psoriasis: This variant of psoriasis is quite common among adults. It is characterized by white blisters which are filled with pus and the broad areas tend to turn red and inflamed. Typically, this type of psoriasis is restricted to the body's smaller areas, such as feet and hands, however, it may even be widespread. - Erythrodermic Psoriasis: This type of psoriasis is quite rare but severe. Often, it affects large areas of the body at once. It causes intense redness, swelling, itching, and pain. The skin of the affected person appears to be almost sunburnt. Scales that are formed tend to slough off in big sheets. The patient may also suffer from fever or fall sick. This type of psoriasis can be life-threatening, so those who are affected by it should consult a doctor immediately. - Guttate Psoriasis: Guttate psoriasis commonly occurs in childhood. It is characterized by small pink spots on the legs, trunk, arms, and scalp. Thick or raised spots like psoriasis patches develop very rarely. - Palmo-Planter Psoriasis: It is one of the common types of psoriasis which affects either sole, palms, or both. Thickening and scaling of the affected skin area occur along with painful, deep fissures on the affected soles and palms. Certain substances, such as cleaning and washing products and detergents, tend to irritate these psoriasis lesions and obstruct them from healing. - Inverse Psoriasis: This variant of psoriasis causes red, inflamed, shiny lesions in the folds of skin of the affected body areas. Inverse psoriasis patches develop under the breasts or armpits, around the skin folds present near the genitals, and in the groin. It causes increased sweating and sensitivity to friction, and it can be quite itchy or painful. - The Psoriatic Nail: About 50 % of psoriasis-affected individuals have psoriasis affecting their toenails or/and fingernails. At times, psoriasis may affect only nails and no other part of the body. The nail may develop yellow to yellow-pink discoloration or the nail plate may get depressed or deeply pitted crumbling into yellowish patches.

These individuals may suffer emotional distress, discomfort due to itching and pain, and restricted motion of the affected joints. Besides this, psoriasis patches impart an unpleasant appearance to the person. Chronic itching and flaking bring embarrassment when getting social.

Often, psoriasis is misunderstood and it brings awkwardness and embarrassment while carrying out social interactions. As a result, the psoriasis patient may suffer emotional problems, such as anger, depression, anxiety, and inferior complex. Diagnosing Psoriasis: - Physical Examination: Usually, the doctors diagnose psoriasis clinically by examining the affected skin carefully, considering the family history and medical history, and the spread on the affected body parts. A simple physical exam is enough for physicians to diagnose psoriasis. - Biopsy: When the symptoms are not clear or when the doctor feels the need to confirm the possible or suspected diagnosis, then they may suggest a biopsy. A small sample of the affected person's skin is taken and sent to a lab for examination under a microscope. It diagnoses not only whether it's psoriasis or not, but also the type of psoriasis. It helps rule out the possibility of other skin infections or disorders. Available Treatment Options For Psoriasis: Psoriasis is indeed a difficult skin condition to treat.
