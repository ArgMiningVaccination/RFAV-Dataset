I understand that generic sponsors are willing to buy these products at fair market value; but, in some cases, branded companies may be using regulatory strategies or commercial techniques to deliberately try to block a generic company from getting access to testing samples.\" - FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. June 21, 2017 Understanding the Generic Marketplace The Generic Drug Market Is Not the Brand Drug Market PAGE 25 Large Buyers Control Almost 90% of Generics PAGE 26 32% 35% Other 10% 23% Sourcing from more than 200 generic manufacturers Source: Fein, Adam, \"The 2017 -18 Economic Report on Pharmaceutical Wholesalers and Specialty Distributors.\" October 2017. Generics Drug Prices Are Falling Further, Faster PAGE 27 But the market trends - de creasing prices - are not sustainable. In the last year, total generic pres criptions are up 2 percent, but revenue is down 13 percent. Policies must safeguard the gener i c market. Otherwise, manufacturers may be forced to exit unprofitable markets - harming patients through potential drug shortages. PAGE 28 We have yet to see generic deflation ease from its current high s ingle digits ( -7% to -9%) where it's been for about three quarters now. -AmerisourceBergen CFO Tim Guttman (August 2017) [The] challenge and headwind we faced in the last half of the year was the rate of generic deflation. -McKesson CFO James Beer (May 2017) We now expect full year pharma segment profit to decline to low double digits versus the prior year. This is primarily due to the previously mentioned generic market pricing. - Cardinal CFO Michael Kaufmann (May 2017) Purchasers Reinforce Deflationary Trends Impact on Patient Access & Outcomes Drug Shortages Threaten Patient Outcomes PAGE 30 Generic drugs seem particularly susceptible to drug shor tages, potentially related to existing market incentives as well as low reimbursement. Responding to a series of drug shortages in 2011, Dr. Scott Got tlieb testified before Congress that many such shortages were a direct result of low reimbursement for older, low -margin products and that \"many hospitals are being forced to ration key medicines and patients to sit on waiting lists for vital drugs.\" The FTC and FDA Should...

Top of value chain is a step or two removed; not as sensitive to impact on bottom Base price guarantee collapses market price 1. Base price transparency at the top of chain collapses price through the chain 2.

What will happen if India stops subsidizing its industry? GLOBAL SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS | 39 Less profits means less investment... Therapy areas with higher upfront costs will see lower willingness to par ticipate given three buyers Already hearing of less willingness to invest in respiratory, peptides Lower profit margin implies less value chain flexibility Fewer, larger facilities; lower excess manufacturing capacity Slower supply chain (defined quantities commitment) Lower ongoing Cap Ex Deterioration in expertise at local level We have seen this with generic injectables... GLOBAL SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS | 40 The impact of rebates and generic fill rate on product choice In market with 1 -2 gener ics, brands often compete with GRx for share Generic competes primarily in price; brand competes with price, structured rebates with P BM, and may have different economics than generics; brand can also bundle added products Most PBM contracts include targets of both GRx fill rates and branded rebate rate; brands w ith very high rebate may be too attractive to give up (Adderall XR) High discounts off price (e.g. brands where Medicaid/340B prices are a penny) may lead t o preference of brand/AG over generic (e.g. Concerta) Critical question is isolating patients from copay differences when the branded product is preferred Insurer / Employer PBM Brand Generic Patient Grx fill rate Rebate rate Copay Price/Rebate; Bundle Price GLOBAL SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS | 41 Leveraging the split between providers and payers in physician administered biosimilars Physician -adm inistered drugs have two pressure points - physician chooses product, payer can require preferring one product In the Remicade case, incumbent contracted exclusive position vs. the biosimilar with s ignificant portion payers; thus every provider must stock innovator products JNJ then gave discounts to providers across a broad portfolio of products, conditioned on v olume of Remicade (with an understanding of demand at each provider) Many providers standardized on innovator; biosimilar share negligible Source of current lawsuit JNJ argues market chose to standardize on innovator rather then on biosimilar given clinical r eliability - our view: true, but JNJ forced the decision and was there first to capture the volume GLOBAL SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS | 42 Formulary coverage in Sole 1st position 1st position - 1 of 21st position - 1 of 31st position - 1 of 41st position - 1 of 51st position - 1 of 61 branded step2 branded stepsNot covered Note: data represents formulary coverage in largest formularies responsible for 50% of US commercial coverage mid 2017; source: Bernstein analysis of formulary data GLOBAL SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS | 43 Infliximab (Remicade) US market, biosimilars did not penetrate Source: IMS; Bernstein analysis 800,000 700,000 600,000 500,000 400,000 300,000 200,000 100,000 0 Jul-17 Oct-17 Jul -17 and just started showing up in September IMS data (7 eaches in September) GLOBAL SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS | 44 Using FDA processes to delay GRx competition REMs Citizen petitions Delay in decision making Two issues: access to reference drug (e.g. Revlimid) and participation in shared REM (e.g. Xyrem. Tracleer ) Multiple citizen petitions, adding information and arguments over time (e.g. Copaxone) FDA refining requirements for approval after generic filing (e.g. Lialda) Require third party management of REMS and generic product sourcing Require fees for CP filing by corporations and use fees to staff response capabilities Make generic product specific guidelines part of NDA process Potential solutions Issue GLOBAL SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS | 45 Generic (and brand) prices are often regressive; most exposed patient pays the highest price Brand or GRx product Price to payer Price in deductible window Cash price Price and dispensing fees negotiated between pharmacy and PBM; patient pays deductible (~$10) often covers most of cost Patient pays price determined by pharmacy; with 'guardrails' provided by PBM/insurer Patient pays full price; what the market will bear HIGH PRICES & NO EXCUSES: 6 ANTICOMPETITIVE GAMES MICHAEL A. CARRIER DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL Crucial Topic Important exercise: patents get attention; post-patent entry often does not I have comprehensively studied patents and antitrust in pharmaceutical industry Co-author of leading IP/antitrust treatise Author of more than 100 articles (40 on pharmaceutical antitrust law) Author of amicus curiae briefs on behalf of hundreds of professors Frequently cited in media (1000+ times) and courts (including U.S. Supreme Court) No (or Weak) Patents Delay Generics Brand profits from monopoly (each day = millions) Regulatory regime used to delay entry: FDA exclusivity, reformulation time, petition process, distribution restrictions This behavior and others also follows from patenting of secondary advances \"Off-patent\" not coming as quickly as it used to as brands obtain weaker patents covering developments after active-ingredient patent expires Small molecule example: Pfizer's strongest Lipitor patents expired in March 2010 & June 2011, but settlement with generics delayed entry until after these periods because of minor patents expiring in 2016 Biologic example: AbbVie's composition-of -matter patent on inflammatory -disease-treating Humira in 2016, but patent thicket of 100+ patents (indication/method of treatment (22), formulation (14), manufacturing (24), \"other\" (15)) extends protection until 2034...53 patents obtained in 2015 and 2016 alone AbbVie Long -Term Strategy , Oct. 30, 2015, http://www.biotechduediligence.com/uploads/6/3/6/7/6367956/abbvie_strategy_presentation__1_.pdf ; Cynthia Koons, This Shield of Patents Protects the World's Best -Selling Drug , BLOOMBERG -the-world-s- -for-delay Settlements FTC v. Actavis: Settlements by which brands pay generics to delay entering market can have \"significant anticompetitive effects\" and violate antitrust law Parties can settle without payment: 2015 FTC Report shows number of settlements (170) increasing while \"pay for delay\" deals fall from 40 (FY2012) to 14 (FY2015), with only 5 above $7m litigation costs 89% of patents in settled litigation are secondary patents; brand less likely to win on these (32%) than on active- ingredient (92%) patents C. Scott Hemphill & Bhaven Sampat, Drug Patents at the Supreme Court, 339 S CIENCE 1386, 1387 (2013) (drugs first eligible for challenges between 2000 and 2008) Most post- Actavis cases cover secondary patents: Actos (method of use), AndroGel (formulation), Cephalon (particle size), Effexor (extended release), K -Dur (formulation), Lidoderm (skin application), Loestrin (contraception method), Niaspan (time release), Opana (time release), Solodyn (treatment method), Wellbutrin (extended release) AndroGel : Patent for synthetic testosterone expired in 1950s Loestrin: FDA approved active ingredients in 1970s Niaspan : Active ingredient niacin sold since early 20th century Game 2: Product Hopping Brand firms often switch to new versions of drug products; many switches not connected to generic entry But some changes, with patient migration to reformulated product, have one purpose: delay generics Prevent operation of state substitution laws and Hatch-Waxman Act Aim to switch market to reformulated version before generic of original version enters market Each switch results in delay from generic reformulation, FDA approval, patent litigation Secondary patents give extra protection: Prilosec to Nexium = 13 years; Suboxone = 14 years; Namenda IR to XR = 14 years Even if no patent , delay from FDA exclusivity and time it takes to reformulate drug Warner Chilcott engaged in multiple hops on acne- treating Doryx (first available in 1985 as unpatented capsule): (1) capsule to 75- and 100- mg tablets, (2) 150- mg single- scored tablet, (3) 75- and 100- mg single- scored tablets, (4) 150- mg dual -scored tablet Also stopped selling capsules, removed capsules from website, worked with retailers to auto- reference tablet in filling prescriptions, informed purchasers and doctors that capsules replaced by tablets, bought back and destroyed capsules Game 3: Citizen Petitions Citizen petitions are meant to raise legitimate safety concerns with FDA But my empirical study of all petitions filed between 2011 and 2015 against pending generics (\"505(q)\" petitions) found that FDA denies 92%; also 98% of late- filed petitions (within 6 months of expiration of patent or FDA exclusivity), 100% of simultaneous petitions (when FDA resolves petition on same day it approves generic) Michael A. Carrier & Carl J. Minniti III, Citizen Petitions: Long, Late- Filed, and At -Last Denied, 66 A MERICAN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW 305 (2016) Last-minute petition example : Bayer's petition on IUD Mirena 1 day before patent expiration Bottleneck example: Allergan's dry -eye-treating Restasis petitions delay generics Feb. 2014 petition denied Nov. 2014; Dec. 2014 petition denied Feb. 2016; Aug. 2017 petition filed Each petition challenges generics' use of in vitro (as opposed to human) testing protocols In 135- page opinion, Judge Bryson invalidated 6 Restasis patents, but generics Mylan, Teva, Akorn still cannot enter market because of Aug. 2017 petition Game 4: REMS Restrictions REMS serve important purpose in making sure risky drugs reach market But brands have used REMS to deny samples generics need for bioequivalence testing 2017 study: REMS restricts 41 drugs with sales exceeding $11 billion Alex Brill, REMS and Restricted Distribution Programs, June 2017, https://www.gphaonline.org/media/cms/Alex_Brill_REMS_Study_June_2017.pdf More than 150 generics have informed FDA they cannot obtain samples In litigated cases, brands have denied samples to generics willing to pay market prices and enter into indemnification agreements And brands have ignored FDA letters showing REMS compliance and protections E.g.: 1) Actelion \"would sell\" sample upon receiving FDA letter but 2) after Apotex provides FDA letter, Actelion responds: \"This changes nothing\" and \"you don't get [the sample]\" Brands also have not negotiated in good faith for shared REMS programs E.g.: Suboxone allegedly turned down invitations to participate in meetings, insisted on unfavorable conditions, refused to share nonpublic information, demanded veto authority and supermajority vote, engaged in delay tactics See Michael A. Carrier, Sharing, Samples, and Generics: An Antitrust Framework, CORNELL LAW REVIEW , at 37 -42 (forthcoming 2017), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2979565 ) Game 5: Non-REMS Distribution Restrictions Some companies have imposed distribution restrictions not required by FDA 2017 study: Non- REMS programs restrict 33 drugs with sales exceeding $11 billion Alex Brill, REMS and Restricted Distribution Programs, https://www.gphaonline.org/media/cms/Alex_Brill_REMS_Study_June_2017.pdf Martin \"Pharma Bro\") switched Turing's infection-treating Daraprim from nationwide to single source: Walgreen's Specialty Pharmacy Active ingredient introduced in 1953; distribution limited 62 years later for no safety -related reason Turing official: \"would like to do our best to avoid generic competition\"; \"certainly not going to make it easier\" price increase ($13.50 to $750) Retrophin (Shkreli's prior company) also switched to closed distribution, blocking generic access on cholesterol -deficiency -treating Chenodal (400% Shkreli: \"We do products to generic companies. . . . The whole model that generics rely upon is turned upside down with specialty pharmacy distribution\" Game 6: Bundling/Rebates Restasis: Shire sued to -eye-disease -treating Xiidra Xiidra can be prescribed to \"much larger population\" and lacks Restasis's side effects but limited to 10% Medicare Part D market (vs 35% commercial market) Challenge bundling and exclusive dealing (if include Xiidra on formularies, lose substantial discounts/rebates on other Allergan drugs) Even if plan received Xiidra for free, \"the numbers still wouldn't work\" Remicade: J&J had only product on market 1998-2016; Pfizer sued, claiming J&J blocked access to arthritis - and Crohn's -treating rival Inflectra Insurers cannot cover Inflectra; otherwise J&J deny rebates (which apply to multiple products) Inflectra has less than 4% of market; J&J price Mylan for offering high (\"practically impossible to refuse\") rebates to insurers, PBMs, and state Medicaid programs; had effect of blocking coverage of rival Auvi -Q Auvi-Q market share fell roughly 50% after rebates took effect Exclusive dealing law : Percentage of market foreclosed important. Also: contract duration, industry prevalence, entry barriers, distribution alternatives Rebate law : Exclusionary effect on competitors (3rd Cir.) vs. attribution test (attribute discount to product on which plaintiff claims exclusion and see if price below cost) (9th Cir.) Proposals Antitrust enforcement : Careful scrutiny of thickets and conduct accompanying secondary patents Settlements: Continued judicial scrutiny and FTC enforcement; consideration of legislation applying presumptive illegality or expanded 180- day exclusivity period Product hopping: Scrutiny of reformulations that cannibalize profitable drugs, making no economic sense other than by stifling generic entry (can apply to hard and soft switches) See Michael A. Carrier & Steve Shadowen, Product Hopping: A New Framework, 92 NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW 167 (2016) REMS: Antitrust scrutiny for sample denials and delayed negotiations on shared REMS See Michael A.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a profitability ratio. It measures the return that an investment generates for those who have provided capital, i.e. bondholders and stockholders. ROIC tells us how good a company is at turning capital into profits. (Source: http://www.htahealth.com ) 92 Are PBMs earning their value?

This may be due to PBMs use of standard contract terms and the dominant market share of the largest PBMs. Many PBM contracts contain standard terms and conditions that are largely nonnegotiable.\" Big 3 PBM Size/Power only increased since 2013 PBM \"Big Three\" Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and OptumRx control between 75- 80 percent of the market All three companies are listed in top 22 of Fortune 500 and in 2013 PBM revenues were estimated at more than $250 Billion Significant market consolidation; CVS Caremark merger; ESI-Medco; Optum -Catamaran Big three PBMs are realistically the only choice for large plans PBMs contract with virtually every other entity in the drug supply chain\u2014 This data knowledge and sheer size = huge advantage PBM Influence in U.S. Supply Chain PBMs negotiate rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers Rebate negotiations drive PBM formulary placement (ultimately determine what medications patients have access to AND at what cost share PBMs contract with employers and health plans to administer their prescription drug benefit and in doing so, heavily influence Rx benefit design \u2014with no PBM fiduciary obligation PBMs own mail order pharmacies and mail order specialty pharmacies that directly compete with retail pharmacies (PBMs also dictate what competing retail pharmacies are reimbursed and what they may charge beneficiaries PBMs, Plan Benefit Design and Lack of Fiduciary Responsibility Employers rely on PBMs to help them navigate drug pricing and plan benefit design PBMs consistently take the position that they are not ERISA fiduciaries and very often contract away any fiduciary responsibility As a result, PBMs typically have no obligation to disclose any/all of their revenue streams OR that certain plan benefit designs may increase PBM profits perhaps at the expense of the plan sponsor If PBMs were required to disclose these potential conflicts of interest, plan sponsors may make different economic decisions or be better equipped to drive a harder bargain Revenue stream(s) derived from every supply chain participant Manufacturer rebates \u2014what is a rebate? -access rebates vs. performance rebates \u2014rebate \"relabeling \") \"Spread\" profits \u2014amount paid to pharmacy \u2014different than amount charged to plan/employer on each prescription filled\u2014 not necessarily disclosed to plan PBM owned mail order/specialty pharmacies Prescriptions filled by plan members are often sold to manufacturers/data repositories.

Virtually e very hospital and the vast majority of non- acute care facilities in the U.S. use a GPO. GPOs are c ompetitive and GPO use is completely voluntary - providers can and do purchase off -contract, and GPO use is driven by value provided. Product decisions are m ade at the facility level , with member input and support groups for all disciplines. GPOs have processes in place to identify innovative and breakthrough products and help them to market. The average GPO contract administrative fee is 1. 22% to 2.25%. (Source: US Government Accountability Office) 134 Overview: GPOs are Critical Sourcing and Cost -Savings Partners to Hospitals, Long -Term Care, Other Providers 135 At a Glance: Virtually All Hospitals and the Vast Majority of Non -Acute Care Facilities Use a GPO Source: Definitive Healthcare A broad range of empirical and academic research finds that GPOs reduce costs for healthcare providers: GPOs reduce healthcare costs; providers realize savings of 10% to 18% by using GPOs ; these savings are likely to be especially valuable to smaller, rural hospitals ; and providers pass these savings onto patients and ultimately to taxpayers . (Leibowitz, O'Brien, 2017) GPOs save the U.S. healthcare system up to $55 billion annually , up to $864.4 billion over ten years , and up to $229 billion in Medicare - and $169 billion in Medicaid savings over the same period. (Dobson DaVanzo, 2014) Approximately 90% of hospitals are satisfied with their GPO , and 88% agree that GPOs reduce costs . (American Hospital Association, Association for Healthcare Resources & Materials Management, Wharton School, 2014) GPOs save the U.S. health care industry $36 billion dollars annually and create an additional $2 billion in annual savings associated with human resources uncommitted to the purchasing process, according to a study of 400+ hospitals. (Schneller, 2009) GPO contract administrative fees have no effect on the total purchasing costs of any provider. (Purdue University, Krannert School of Management, 2011) 136 GPOs Reduce Costs for Hospitals, Healthcare Providers, Medicare and Medicaid, and Taxpayers GPO U.S. C OST SAVINGS : Up to $55 billion annually Up to $864 billion over ten years Up to $229 billion in Medicare savings and $169 billion in Medicaid savings over 10 years $2 billion in annual savings on human resource costs 10%-18% average savings In 2017, Former FTC Chair Jon Leibowitz and former FTC Deputy Director of the Bureau of Economics Dan O'Brien conducted a comprehensive economic and legal analysis of the role, business model and impact of GPOs and found that: 137 Former FTC Chair Jon Leibowitz and Deputy Director Dan O'Brien Affirm GPO Cost Savings, Competition GPOs save money for healthcare providers, patients and taxpayers. GPOs operate in a vigorously competitive procurement market. The current GPO vendor funding model is consistent with competition and cost savings . Changing the GPO vendor funding model would likely raise costs.

Funded by the Healthcare Supply Chain Association \"We find no empirical, economic or policy basis for forcing GPOs to shift to an alternate funding mechanism.\" - Leibowitz, O'Brien, Anello, 2017. The 2017 Leibowitz/O'Brien study found that GPOs operate in a highly competitive market. Specific conclusions about the competitive nature of the GPO market included: 138 GPOs Operate in a Highly Competitive Market More than 100 national, regional and local GPOs and regional cooperatives compete w ith each other to provide GPO services; The GPO market operates with a level of competition equivalent to an unconcentrated m arket with more than 10 independent competitors of equal size; Providers can c hoose from multiple GPOs and also can, and commonly do, use multiple GPOs simultaneously . On average, providers use between 2- 3 GPOs; Providers often control their own GPO, which creates s trong incentives to offer competitive pricing ; Providers can p urchase from a competing GPO or procure supplies directly from vendors ; Intense competition suggests that the vendor -f ee model is more efficient than other models .

Funded by the Healthcare Supply Chain Association Congress included the GPO Safe Harbor in its Medicare and Medicaid Patient Protection Act of 1987 to protect the cost -savings and efficiencies realized through lawful GPO practices.* The provision did not initiate any new business practices, it merely clarified that existing GPO business practices were lawful: 139 GPO Safe Harbor, Model, and Oversight Pursuant to the GPO Safe Harbor: GPOs have w ritten contract with each member; GPOs disclose that an administrative fee is collected, and a ny fee above 3% must be specifically identified in the contract agreement ; GPOs r eport annually to members on all administrative fees collected from GPO contract use; GPOs ma ke all fee information available at the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services; Hospitals must r eport GPO fee distributions as part of Medicare cost reports and GPOs encourage hospitals to accurately reflect fee information in these reports. Business model and oversight: GPO Safe Harbor not unusual - 1 of 23 provisions in 1987 Act addressing a range of lawful business practices; Vendor funding model likely r educes transaction costs and neither empirical evidence nor economic theory suggests that vendor fees raise prices; Industries leveraging group buying/vendor fee model include g overnment procurement (DOD, VA), food service , online marketplaces (Amazon, eBay, Living Social), consumer credit , hospitality and non-profit industries ; GPO model and business practices thoroughly reviewed by FTC , G AO, DOJ , U.S. Supreme Court , 8th Circuit Court of Appeals , academia, and hospitals, and all have concluded that no change is needed.

Health L. & Pol'y 23 (2012) ( with Robert Litan & Anna Birkenbach) 168 Relevant (and Irrelevant) Questions Relevant Q: Would a change in the GPO compensation structure le ad to lower supply costs for member hospitals? -Compensation is from suppliers, not their member hospitals -GPOs enjoy exemption to the anti- k ickback statute of the Social Security Act, which makes it illegal to receive any compensation from suppliers for items reimbursable by federal health care programs -Theory of harm in RTI v Becton Dickinson (E.D. Tex 2003) Irrelevant Q: Do GPOs reduce health care prices relative to a world without GPOs? -In theory (though not proven), GPOs lower prices relative to individual negotiations by hospitals due t o (1) bargaining power and (2) transactions costs Two questions blur only if you believe there is no alternative to current compensation s tructure -GAO (2014): Hospital consolidation + use of aftermarket subscription services suggest GPOs would s urvive -GPOs survived for ~80 years without supplier- s ide funding 169 Monopoly Concessions in Other Industries Municipalities grant concessions to cable service providers, f unded by franchise fees -DOJ (2007- 08) recognized conflict of interests; sent ex parte letter to FCC, sent letters to nine states considering statewide franchising legislation, and issued a report on video competition Prisons grant concessions to single provider of long distance s ervice, funded by \"site commissions\" (aka kickbacks) -Average cost of 15- min ute call in states (37) that allow kickbacks: $2.40 -Average cost of 15- minute call in states (14) that don't allow kickbacks: $1.58 Source: w ww.prisonphonejustice.org 170 Testimonials Healthcare Matters Principal Editor Thomas Finn: \"As a member -d riven enterprise, it is common knowledge that Premier [the second largest GPO] and other GPOs 'share back' with their members and owners. In fact, many hospital executives who are part of the Premier alliance have learned to rely on that share back as an integral part of their annual compensation.\" - Healthcare Matters, July 22, 2013 Asst. Secretary of HHS K oh under President Obama: \"First of all, these agreements are made often through these long -term contracts and so also this whole process involves multiple stake -holders, especially and including the pharmacy benefit managers and the group purchasing organizations. So it complicates this environment and sort of does not make relevant the sort of standard supply and demand economic principles that we see in other businesses.\" - Testimony before the September 23, 2011 House Energy & Commerce Committee 171 When Buying Agent Is Compensated by a Fixed Percent of Revenues from Supplier, and Marginal Costs Are Zero, Best to Grant a Monopoly 172 Demand Marginal revenue PM QM PM is chosen by monopoly supplier to maximize profit, which also maximizes revenue when marginal costs are zero. Any lower price (P L) would generate less revenue under the concession, and thus a smaller commission.

Prices Quantities Marginal Costs P* PC QC Key Findings of Litan, Singer & Birkenbach (2012) When br okered by an agent not compensated by suppliers , hospitals enjoy an average price reduction of 10-14% from 2001 through 2010 -Each additional rival bid dropped price significantly -Incumbent dropping its own bid decreased auction price significantly -Anecdotal evidence (e.g., Mas imo/pulse oximeters ) where price effect from entry is much larger Implication: Consistent with claim that, due to incentive dis tortion, GPOs are not securing competitive price for their hospital members 174 Other Potential Harms of Funding Mechanism Compared to direct payment of rebates by m anufacturers, lump-sum payments of rebates from GPOs is less commonly credited by hospitals to individual medical device purchases on their cost reports to government GAO (2014) at 21: \"To the extent that administrative f ee revenue is not reflected on cost reports, Medicare could be overpaying hospitals.\" 175 Criticisms: Johnston & Rooney (2012) Large, high -value products are not representative of all products purchased by GPOs (at 83); aftermarket purchases are more \"definite\" (at 83), exhibit greater \"commitment\" (at 84) -Caveat our findings by saying that apply to these types of purchases, which account for 20% of all GPO purchase; also, 20% is not a small sample; -No reason that a kickback regime would inflate the cost of high- value products but not low -value products; economic incentives are to maximize revenue regardless of product type -While there may be uncertainty over units purchased by single hospital pursuant to GPO contract, purchases across all hospitals within GPOs are more certain See appendix for more rejoinders 176 Criticisms: O'Brien, Leibowitz & Anello (2017) Findings do not suggest price differential can be attributed to GPO funding mode l (at 6) -But to what other feature of GPOs could the price differential be attributed? -Subscription -bas ed aftermarket services are a reasonable proxy for outcomes with an alternative funding mechanism Because tax incidence is neutral with respect to where tax is levied, funding sour ce doesn't matter (at 9) -Not applicable because tax revenues to be collected in econ textbooks are assumed to be ex ogenous; in case of GPOs, fees collected under the concession are endogenous\u2014that is, they depend on the number of suppliers, which is within the GPO's domain -If the funding model doesn't matter, then why do they care enough to hire consultants to keep it the same way? See appendix for more rejoinders 177 Do These \"Incentive Distortions\" Apply to Prescription Drugs? In one sense, prescription drugs are more differentiated than devices, which suggests GP Os are not needed to maintain pricing power But there are still ways in which a GPO could put upward pressure on drug prices -Brokering a bundled contract to prevent entry on \"tied\" product -Agreeing to stock only one Hep C drug in hospital pharmacy, limiting brand -to-brand competition -Sole -s ource contracts for generic drugs means major drug makers that don't get contracts may and have discontinued production; when shortages hit, the price increases have been astronomical A hospital might be able to get by with an inferior medical device, as long as they have o ne, but they can't get by without a lifesaving generic injectable drug if it is in short supply and there is no acceptable substitute 178 Price Effects Bundling brokered by Physician Buying Groups shown to inflate price of pe diatric vaccines -To induce S anofi purchasers to switch to Novartis' Menveo vaccine, Novartis would have to pay a negative price (i.e., compensate the physician practice) for losing the bundled discount (Caves & Singer 2012) Anecdotal evidence from Physicians Against Drug Shortages (PADS) -\"One member who practices at a s urgicenter that does NOT buy through GPO contracts reports that his facility currently pays $22 for a 10 -vial box of propofol , compared $55 at another member's GPO- affiliated surgicenter .\" -\"Another PADS member found that she could have purchased over -the- c ounter supplies, such as Advil, bandages, and cotton balls, from Costco for up to 50% less than what her health system was paying through its GPO contracts, but her superiors wouldn't allow her to do so.\" 179 Output Effects GPO contracting practices have been blamed for drug shortages GPO's tax on drug makers could lead to smaller inventories or discontinued pr oduction of some drugs, particular for low-margin generics (Moss 2012; Kweder & Dill 2013; Schweitzer 2013; FDA 2011; House of Reps. 2012) After reviewing literature and interviewing industry participants, GAO ide ntified GPOs as one of three \"underlying causes\" in drug shortage (GAO Feb. 2014) Other causes include competition based primarily on price (interwoven with GPO), an d change in Medicare Part B reimbursement policy Med Part B alt hypothesis discredited by former HHS Secretary G lied (2014) (explaining that the change in the reimbursement formula has never regulated either the level of prices paid to manufacturers or the flexibility of those prices) 180 Conclusions Removing exemption to the anti -ki ckback provision would benefit health care consumers by: -Lowering drug (and medical device) prices -Reducing entry barriers/fostering greater in novation in medical supply industries -Alleviating drug shortages 181 Appendix 182 Criticisms: Johnston & Rooney (2012) Policy prescription would benefit the medical device industry (at 73) - But fixing perverse incentives would engender more competition for the GPO contract, eroding margins in upstream industries - Device industry not uniformly impacted: Status quo favors incumbents ( A dvamed ), penalizes entrants (MDMA) Self- funding would result in higher net outlays for hospitals (at 75) - Only true if the requisite administrative fees exceed the hidden costs that manifest in the form of inflated supply prices S ome or all of the fees are returned to the hospitals via distributions (at 82) - But fees (around 2% of price) likely do not compensate for the overcharges on the underlying products (> 10 %) - GPOs distribute only 70% of total revenue to members (GAO 2014) - And even if they did, distributions to equity members do not compensate non- equity members L arge, high- value products are not representative of all products purchased by GPOs (at 83); aftermarket purchases are more \"definite\" (at 83), exhibit greater \"commitment\" (at 84) - Caveat our findings by saying that apply to these types of purchases, which account for 20% of all GPO purchase; also, 20% is not a small sample; - No reason that a kickback regime would inflate the cost of high -value products but not low- value products; economic incentives a re to maximize revenue regardless of product type - While there may be uncertainty over units purchased by single hospital pursuant to GPO contract, purchases across all hospitals within GPOs are more certain 183 Criticisms: O'Brien, Leibowitz & Anello (2017) Member ownership ensures GPO acts in hospitals' best interest (at 6) - Economists recognize agency problems (small stakes, information asymmetry); they aren't eliminated by vertical integration - GPO administrators' compensation is funded via hospital expenditures , not savings Ability to seek lower prices outside GPO ensures GPO act in hospitals' best interests (at 6) - Presumes that hospitals easily observe competitive prices for similar products; yet no such transparency exists - Given that government reimburses hospitals for many purchases, hospital lacks strong incentive to identify savings - Hospital forgoes bundled or volume discounts by purchasing outside of its GPO contract - It would be difficult for a GPO entrant to lure hospitals by claiming that subscription fees are \"better than free\" - Some GPO contracts with member hospitals also require GPO exclusivity Findings do not suggest price differential can be attributed to GPO funding model (at 6) - Fair, but to what other feature of GPOs could the price differential be attributed? - Subscription -based aftermarket services are a reasonable proxy for outcomes with an alternative funding mechanism Because tax incidence is neutral with respect to where tax is levied, funding doesn't matter (at 9) - Not applicable because tax revenues to be collected are assumed to be exogenous ; in case of GPOs, fees collected under the concession are endogenous \u2014that is, they depend on the number of suppliers, which is within the GPO's domain - If the funding model doesn't matter, then why do they care enough to hire consultants to keep it the same way? 184 Criticisms: O'Brien, Leibowitz & Anello (2017) Collecting fees from 2,500 vendors is more efficient than doing so from 103,000 hospitals (at 10) - Incremental costs of accommodating your 2,501st client is effectively zero; that is, same system that could accommodate 2,500 clients could likely accommodate 103,000 clients If vendor fees were barred, GPOs would replace with sales -based fees from hospitals (at 11) - No basis to assume sales-based fees, when flat- price subscription fees for aftermarket auctions already exist in the market Vendor- paid fees are common; used by Amazon, eBay and credit cards (at 11) - But you don't have the same principal -agent problem. And Amazon users are shopping with better information, myriad choices. - Credit card example is inapposite. Amex receives a % of revenue paid to merchants, but it is not involved in negotiating pric es on behalf of the merchants in its network. Econ literature doesn't support idea that sales -based payments are conducive to exclusion (at 12) - Literature shows that buyers do not need payments to abide by exclusivity provisions, so long as the \"penalty price\" for non- compliance is set sufficiently high. Thus, the form of the payments (flat or proportional to sales) is irrelevant. - Payment in this case is to an agent (GPO), not to the buyer (hospital), which can facilitate the exclusion. Direct rebates from vendors raise same concern because buyer may fail to those report too (at 12) - False. Rebate from a supplier would be easier to trace back to a particular purchase (for reporting purposes) than would a pr ofit distribution from a GPO. 185 Drug Trend National Pharmacy Programs & Services October 2017 187 \u00a9 2017 Kaiser Permanente Outpatient Brand Drug Cost Trend Outpatient drug spend on brand medications has increased steadily over the last four years, averaging 16% in annual growth on a cost per prescription (RX) basis. On a PMPM basis, brand drug cost growth plateaus in 2016 due largely to lower hepatitis C utilization. 188 \u00a9 2017 Kaiser Permanente Outpatient Specialty Drug Cost Trend Specialty drug is defined as cost of $600 or more for a 30 day prescription. As of YTD Sep 2017, specialty drugs represented 39% of the total outpatient drug spend but only 1% of the total outpatient prescription volume. Specialty drug cost on a PMPM basis has increased steadily with the exception of 2016, driven by the decline in hepatitis C utilization. Specialty drug cost on a cost per prescription basis has increased steadily, slowing in 2017 as a result of lower hepatitis C spend. 189 \u00a9 2017 Kaiser Permanente Clinic Administered Medications (CAMS) for Oncology Clinic pharmacy drug spend for oncology have increased by double digit percentages annually on a dollar and dollar PMPM basis. The increase in spend is driven by increases in both utilization from expanded FDA indication approvals and by unit cost increases. 25.2% 26.5% 53.3% 17.6% 20.2% Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) Example Significant growth has been experienced for Enbrel and Humira demonstrate the increasing cost to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This is one example of the rising cost of specialty drugs. Enbrel WAC increased by a compounded average growth rate or CAGR of 14.2% between 2013 to 2017 Price changes include various dosage forms of the injection and Sureclick\u00ae injection. Humira WAC increased by a CAGR of 14.4% between the same time period Price changes include various dosage forms of the pen injection and kit injection. 191 November 8, 2017 Panel 3: Understanding Intermediaries: Group Purchasing Organizations 192 November 8, 2017 BREAK 193 November 8, 2017 Discussion: Potential Next Steps to Encourage Entry and Expand Access through Lower Prices High prescription drug prices: Balancing access and affordability Rena Conti, PhD Associate Professor Departments of Pediatrics & Public Health Sciences The University of Chicago rconti@uchicago.edu Acknowledgements and disclaimer The basis of this presentation is work done in collaboration with Peter Bach, Erns t Berndt, Melinda Buntin, David Howard, Sayeh Nikpay , Meredith Rosenthal and Josh Sharfstein .

Enhance transparency/reduce profit seeking in the value chain. 205 Improve generic supply competition FTC has critical role to play: Reduce Scott- H art-Rodino thresholds on merger revenue scrutiny. Vigorously pursue pay for delay, product hop, other evergreening a ctivities. FDA has critical role to play: Lower b arriers to entry through GDUFA fee revisions. Preserve ability to reenter molecule markets after temporary supply disruptions/exits. Identify alternative suppliers meeting quality manufacturing metrics. Ensure qua lity manufacturing, redundant supply through other activities. 206 Enhance transparency/reduce profit seeking in the value chain Reduce physicians/hospitals/pharmacies ability to profit off high priced drug s.
