The main approach of the method/pedagogy is by reliving past experiences and trauma through participation in the Oral Tradition of Sacred Ceremony. This doctoral research project will share my personal experience of this Traditional Lifeway Teaching using heard stories, Sacred Instructions, Songs, and Dreams as the primary source of reference. My intention for sharing these teachings in this academic context is to provide a point of reference to other Anishinaabe/Indigenous students so that they can begin their own personal research as I have done to maintain this path through colonization. I am doing this work to validate our Ojibwe Traditional Healing Methods and to promote and support confidence in the psychology of Indigenous Healing Ceremonies for Indigenous students as they move forward in a Good Way. In a very small way, my contributions through this doctoral research project will begin to address some of the issues in 'decolonizing' the academy for Indigenous students. iii Dedication To all the Ones who are bringing forward Traditional Indigenous Knowledge within the academy iv Acknowledgments Firstly, I would like to acknowledge my Doodoom (Mother) and my Aunties (her sisters) .

The Seven Stages of Life Lodge contains within it all the plans Great Kind Mystery had put in place for every human being on this planet throughout our lifetimes. The Healing happens within our Sacred Life Lodge as we reflect on our past life experiences from infancy to our present time. Sharing this Sacred Gift in this manner has relevance today in the spirit of Truth and Reconciliation. Reflecting on this part of my life experience on this linear page is harsh. It has opened that part of my life that was stored in the bottom of my mind with all of these painful memories. This part of my life experience is very difficult and is usually shared only within the Oral Tradition of Ceremony. Remembering the hurt, pain, and sorrow caused by my 'residential school' experience is profound. Sharing our own 'truth' using this Sacred Healing Gift is one of the ways we, as Anishinaabeg (Human Beings), still a subjugated people, have survived. Traditional Knowledge of our old 'healing ways', are still guarded and are not taught by just anyone. Where are the Healers? Where are the Teachers? The Nanaandawi'iwed (Healer) needs to be impeccable (insanely truthful and of high moral character), we need to live in a Good Way, alcohol and drug free. We definitely need to be able to put our egos away for the sake of Debwewin (Truth). Healers need to observe every protocol. With these written words it is my wish to begin an open dialogue with the academy and the Faculty of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto (OISE/UT) with regards to the Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRCC). I believe the time to share my 'Life Story' is here. I have had to face my own 'truth' and reconcile that 'truth' through the process of returning to and remembering the pain and sorrow of all these memories. Coming to terms with my own feelings about what happened, has such importance not only to me and my family, but to all the Indigenous peoples of world who have been hurt like myself through colonization. This Sacred Teaching began for me in 1991 at Laurentian University in a Ceremony that was conducted in class by Jim Dumont, Gichi aya'aagzid (Traditional Elder), Naano (Chief of the Eastern Doorway of the Three Fires Grand Medicine Lodge). My apprenticeship into the Three Fires Society, Grand Medicine Lodge, included instructions and training in the methods of Traditional Ojibwe Psychological Healing practices through participation and experiencing the Ceremonies of Sweat Lodge, Healing, Fasting, and Name Giving Ceremonies. My own experiences, my Oral Traditional Training/Learning, Ojibwemowin (Ojibwe Language) instruction came through my Doodoom (Mother) who believed strongly that our Sacred Healing Ceremonies are essential to my life as an Ojibwe Anishinaabe Ikwe (Indian Woman) not a brown, white lady. It was important to her that I learn and understand the 'old Ojibwe Anishinaabe Way' through Ojibwemowin (Ojibwe language) and in performance of Ojibwe Sacred Ceremony. Achieving my First and Second Degrees in the Three Fires Society Grand Medicine Lodge gives me certain rights, 'Teaching Rights'. This allows me to share this 'Teaching' of the Ojibwe Anishinaabe (Good Human Being) Seven Stages of Life with the academy, faculty, and the students here at OISE/UT. The language I use in Ceremony and throughout this doctoral research project is Ojibwemowin the Sacred Sound of the Anishinaabeg Nations. All Anishinaabeg have this beautiful way of communicating with each other and expressing our feelings/emotions through our Sacred Indigenous Language 'Ojibwemowin'. Bringing forward Ojibwe Traditional Healing Knowledges in this manner allows for the creation of a safe, healthy, open environment (Indigeneity) here on campus based on Kindness, Acceptance, and Trust. Reaching out to Indigenous students in the academy in a Healing and Wholesome Way such as the sharing of this 'Teaching' within our Sacred Circle addresses in a very small way the 'decolonization' of learning/teaching institutions. This Healing and Wholesome Way means sitting in a Sacred Circle where all Peoples are equal and safe to speak their own Truth which enables them to proceed in this pedagogy of Healing. Since 'Time Immemorial' the have followed Gichi Gete Mino Bimaadiziwin (Old Traditional Good Life Way) by observing the Seven Stages of Life. 3 This diagram is my interpretation of the Seven Stages of Life Teaching from conception to death. Anishinaabe Teachings always begin in the East (the right side of the page). The First Stage is representative of 'Birth' moving throughout that Circle to the Second Stage which is referred to as the 'Fast Life' which then proceeds through the Wandering/Wondering Life, Truth Life, Planning/Planting Life, Doing/Teaching Life, to the Elder Good Life. The Western Direction is where Life/this Reality ends (on the left side of the page). Figure 1: Seven Stages of Life Lodge, Jacque Lavallee (2021) I am not an artist, but I was shown through a Dream how I could draw the diagram. The Dream started with white ghostly figures with black solid-like structure inside, almost like stick men inside balloons. The first figure (on the right) represents a new baby crawling into this reality (being born). The second is figure is still stumbling around getting his bearings. The third figure is running through this Circle listening, hearing, seeing, and learning. In the Third Stage I drew four figures wandering around in circles wondering why? The Fourth Stage is perfecting our future plan. The figure on the left-hand side of the Fifth Stage Circle is a man and the figure on the right side represents a woman who has just lost her skirt. In the Sixth Stage is a family with a Mom and Dad and two kids doing and teaching life. In the Elder Good Life again we are caring for our Old People through this stage. The old bent man holds a cane. The Stars at the Western Doorway represent the Spirit World. The small little Stars at the beginning in the East represent the Star World. 4 This 'old life-way' is referred to as 'Traditional Indigenous Knowledge' as 'Indigenous Worldview' in western academia. Ojibwe Anishinaabeg (Good Beings) were given very specific rules, protocol and instructions by Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) and all of the Creation on how to live, survive and be happy on the land in this beautiful place that we call Mishiikenh Minissing (Turtle Island/North America). This 'old traditional good life way' requires great self-discipline, determination, dedication and sacrifice. Old People describe 'living life' as being in this moment, not before birth and not after death. In Anishinaabe Tradition our life plan is already in place. Through the sharing of Dreams and thoughts with our parents, brothers, sisters, Aunties, and Traditional Elders of our community everyone has an understanding of what you are going through and will speak to you in Ceremony or in a personal private manner. This way of teaching and learning about life was severed by removing children from their Sacred Landscapes, families, communities. Life begins in the Eastern Doorway/Direction (right side of the page) where we are born into the safety of our own loving homes and within our Sacred Homelands/Environment. Our life experience continues on throughout our teenage life still within the safe confines of our loving home environment throughout our eighteenth year. Death begins at the Western Doorway into the Spirit Realm, the Star World. From the time we are born to our death in 'old age' we journey towards the Western Doorway. Ojibwe Traditional Protocol/Ethics Protocols begin and are taught within our own family structure, starting from our parents down through our older siblings. I am responsible for all of my younger siblings. Anishinaabe protocol acknowledges the Traditions and Rules for living a 'Good Life' that were set up and came into play since 'time immemorial'. The Old People say that Anishinaabeg, have occupied the complete areas around the Great Lakes for 44,000 years. All present-day protocols connect to this intergenerational experience and refer to Seven Generations into the Future. First Protocol: Asemaa Nitam (Sacred Tobacco First) 5 The first Ojibwe Anishinaabe Protocol is Asemaa Nitam (Sacred Tobacco First). Asemaa is our most important of the Four Sacred Medicines. It occupies fully the Eastern Direction. Asemaa was the first Sacred Medicine to be touched by Anishinaabe. If Asemaa (Sacred Tobacco) is not honoured in this manner then there is no need to talk about anything. Second Protocol: Be Kind Be Kind to every living thing on this planet. Offer Asemaa Nitam (Sacred Tobacco First). This is Kindness in its fullest. This includes offerings to bugs, snakes, fish, all the plant life, the Four-Leggeds the deer, bison, moose and caribou and animal life, all the fliers, the Eagles, the Condors, the Butterflies, and the Bees. Be Kind to all human beings starting with your own family. Third Protocol: Be Happy The Third Protocol is the hardest state to achieve as we all know. Being happy is inclusive of taking good care of ourselves so that we can take good care of others. We need others to help us when we are sick or depressed. We need to humble ourselves and ask for that help and support from our families. Happiness is only achieved through the discipline of daily self-examination as we put our egos behind us through the simple Ceremony of offering ourselves Sacred Smoke (Smudging). We can't encourage happiness if we ourselves are not happy. So be happy! Fourth Protocol: Non-Interference Aanikoobijiganang Giigidwaad (What Our Ancestors Said) When we reach 18 years of age, our Gitiziimag (Parents) can no longer tell us 'what to do', 'when to do', and 'how to do'. Our Gitiziimag (Parents) no longer have the right to give direction or make corrections. Instead, to always present good options thereby giving us the opportunity of making our own choices. As Gitiziimag (Parents) we are allowed/given eighteen years to instruct our children in living Mino Bimaadiziwin ('Good Life'). When they fall down and struggle in life, we as family members are responsible to help our relatives up, dusting them off, giving them water and food. We shelter them for a period of time, without interference. This help, support and caring is given until they recover their own sense of balance and are able to proceed 6 on into the future in a Good Way. Even if they are 90 years-old, we are committed to caring for our sick and infirm until death. Today, in this reality (place, space and time), many Ojibwe Anishinaabeg (Good Beings) still choose to follow Gichi Gete Mino Bimaadiziwin (Old Traditional Good Life Way) by accepting and following these protocols. Traditional Protocol Specific to Introduction of Self 'Traditional Ojibwe Introduction' follows the Three Fires Society, Midewigaan. These protocols have been in place since 'time immemorial' and will be strictly adhered to. Maajiitaadaa (let's begin) I send up Gichitaawa Zaagaabteg (Sacred Smoke) N'Biindaakoojige Asemaa, Sacred Tobacco, Gichi Mewnzha (Long Ago) in the very beginning of time as we know it by Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) to Nanaboozhoo (Ojibwe First Teacher) that every time Anishinaabeg (Good Beings) were overwhelmed and overcome with emotion or were Miigwech Wendaam (Feeling Thankful) we would send up Zaagaabteg (Sacred Smoke) and words of Miigwechaawin (Gratitude and Thankfulness). In this manner, we show Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) and Gikinaa Manidooyag (All Spirits) we are going to raise our Spirits up in Sacred Ceremony. With our Asemaa (Sacred Tobacco) in our hand, we will call out: \"Nanaboozhoo! Nanaboozhoo! Nanboozhoo! Nanaboozhoo!\", our First Teacher's to Wndaanmaak Nodiinoon (Four Directions). 7 Nanaboozhoo's First Story In the long-ago time as Nanaboozhoo grew into a Gichi Gete Inini (Very Old Man) and His work here in this reality was nearly complete, Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) called Nanaboozhoo to come sit with Him. He told Nanaboozhoo about a plan He had for the future of all things, all the Anishinaabeg, and the whole of the 'Creation'. Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) told Nanaboozhoo that He had prepared a Sacred Place for Him in Anangokaan (the Star-world) halfway between the 'Bottom of our Hearts' and the 'Top of the Sky'. It is the same place as in the very beginning of time that Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) had sent Nanaboozhoo to continue his journey to Doodoom Aki (Mother Earth) alone, all by himself. Nanaboozhoo ran back to Gizhem Manidoo's side three times. He did not want to leave Him. This was the beginning of time as we know it. It was the third stopping place for the 'New Being'. It is the place of Mide Manidoo (Grand Medicine Lodge Mystery). It is from this place that we receive our instructions in how to live Mino Bimaadiziwin (the Good Life Way) through Maakedewin (Fasting) and Bwaajigemin (Dreaming) Niswe Ishkode Midewigaan (The Three Fires Grand Medicine Lodge). The Midewigaan (the Grand Medicine Lodge) began here at this place in Giizhigokaan (Sky World). Nanaboozhoo felt a great sadness and sorrow, his feelings were hurt, his heart was breaking. Just thinking about this 'leaving time/parting time' made him feel so bad right in his heart where LOVE rests. He cried so much because he wouldn't be able to hear Abinoojiinhag (the Children) laughing and playing from way up there in Giizhigokaan (Sky World). He wouldn't hear Ikwewag (the Women) singing the Gichi taawaa Nagamonag (Sacred Songs). He would miss hearing the soft, gentle words from the Ininiwag (Men) and the sweet, kind loving sound from Gichi-aya'aag/ Mishomisag/ Gokoomisag (Old Wise Ones/ Grandfathers/Grandmothers). Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) was quiet for a while and thought of a solution. Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) gave Nanaboozhoo the gift of keen hearing. They said his hearing was so acute, he could hear an Gookookoo (Owl) flying in the Biiboon (Winter), even in the dark nighttime. Now, that's really good hearing! Gizhem Manidoo told Nanaboozhoo that every time Anishinaabe spoke His name, 'Nanaboozhoo', He would be able to hear us, even if we just whispered. He would still be able to help the Anishinaabe People whenever they sent up Zaagaabteg (Sacred Smoke) to request his help. The 'old ones' say when we talk to Spirits we still need to make that first sound, \"whisper his name\" they tell us. We are still saying, 'Nanaboozhoo!' the name of our 'First Teacher' in every Ceremony to honour that 8 promise from Gichi Mewiinzha (Time Immemorial), the long-ago time. Our first sound is 'Nanaboozhoo'. Our second sound is 'Gizhem Manidoo'. This promise came from Gizhem Manidoo to Nanaboozhoo that the first sound to come from our faces, out of our mouths in Ceremony is the name of our First Teacher. We say 'Nanaboozhoo' then we say 'Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery)'. Our First Teacher's name is, 'Nanaboozhoo', East shore Georgian Bay Ojibwe, 'Waynaaboozhoo', around Lake 'Manaboozhoo', southeast Saulteaux Ojibwe all across the Flatland from the treeline west of Ontario to the mountains in Alberta. When we begin our day, or our Prayer, the first sound is Nanaboozhoo (First Teacher) followed by Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery). Nanaboozhoo's Second Story One time, when Nanaboozhoo returned from Giizhigokaan (Sky World), he was hoping to surprise his relatives by being very quiet. He was very old and frail and was all bent over carrying a huge Bundle of Teachings on His back. Becoming aware of His weakened condition, He called out, 'Shknaa Awiiyaa, Naadimaashin (Hey, someone, anyone come and help me)!' Niizh Shki Ininaatigoog (Two young Maple Tree Saplings) uprooted themselves, came and stood beside Him to help. They gave Him the support He needed to carry His Big Bundle of Teachings to continue His journey home with His important work. As they neared, Nanaboozhoo's Oodenaang (The Home of First Teacher's Heart/Village), Diindiisinh (Bluejay) saw him, calling out in a loud voice, 'Nanaaboozhoo! Nanaaboozhoo! Nanaaboozhoo! Nanaaboozhoo!' and went flying through Mtigwaakii (the Bush). It was Diindiisinh (Bluejay) who gave Nanaboozhoo, Our First Teacher, His Gichi taawaa Noozwin (Sacred Spirit Name). As he called out, 'Nanaaboozhoo!' four times, all the people came out of their wiigiwaams (shelters), held their left hand over their hearts extending their right hands in friendship calling: 'Nanaboozhoo! What teachings have you brought for us? What are we going to learn from each other? What are you going to share with us?'. This was the first Naming Ceremony. Protocol of Traditional Ojibwe Midewiwin Introduction 1) We say our Gichi taawaa Ikwe is my 9 (Ojibwe language). My name is Jacque/line Lavallee. I Old People used to call this time 'Power Time'. When the Sun is halfway across the Sky, the People are most Sacred because we cannot see our shadow which makes us invisible and free to walk in Spirit World. This is the Summer Solstice, June 21st. 2) We state our Ojibwe Doodem (Clan). A'ginzo Waabizheshii Doodem. I belong to Waabizheshii (Marten) Clan. We are the Warriors, Defenders, Protectors, Guardians of the People. We are excellent 'Strategists'. Because of our hunting skills and tracking skills, we are the prime 'Providers'. We are the 'Adoption Clan'. Parts of the story regarding how that came to be are guarded, but I can share this little bit. The first adoptions were the women and children of the Mooz Doodem (Moose Clan) since time immemorial. We also adopted the children of intermarriage/half-bloods. It is said that we became smarter because of the knowledge the half-bloods had through their 'white' blood. My Dede's Doodem (Father's Clan) is Marten. My Dede (Father) Norman of Nayaashingaaming (Cape Croker) is their Father's Clan. His Doodoom (Mother) is Boodewaadami (Keepers of the Fire) and his Dede (Father) is Algonquin-Waabanaakii (People of the Dawn/East Coast) Kitigan Ziibi in Quebec and a little bit Wemitigoozhi (French from across the ocean). This makes him Waabizheshii /Half-blood (Marten Clan). He referred to himself and all his children as 'M\u00e9tis' based on his name 'Lavallee' and because of the union of the Waabanakii (People of the Dawn) and Wemitigoozhi (French). My Grandfather's Family is Algonquin-Waabanaakii and bangii Wemitigoozhi (a little bit of French blood). 3) We state our Indigenous Indigenous Nations/Affiliations are who we belong to, who we are. As Anishinaabeg I am Ojibwe, Keepers of Sacred Teachings, Songs, Stories, Language, and Ceremonies (from my Mother's side). I am Boodewaadamii, Keepers of the Fire from my Gokoomis (Grandmother, my Dede's Mother). Both the Ojibwe Nation and the Boodewaadamii Nation are two of the Three Fires Confederacy. The Odawa Nation is the third. 4) We state where we come from, where we belong, and where we were born, usually our Mother's Reserve (the old way). Anishinaabe Ikwewag (Indigenous Woman) in the long-ago-time did not leave their Doodoomag (Mothers) when they married off reserve or away from home. She brought her wiigiiwagan (the one she walks with) home with her to help out her Doodoom (Mother) and N'godoodemag (Family). I was born in 'Zhawaanige (the Long South Portage/Channel). My Doodoom (Mother) was Agnes Abiitang (Sitters/Singers at Traditional Wakes) Bimaadjiwan (Water Turning Back on Itself), her Gichi tawaa Noozwin (Sacred Spirit Name) is she is Ojibwe from 'Zhawaanige (Shawanaga First Nation). She belongs to Name Doodem (Sturgeon Clan). My Gokoomis (Grandmother) Mary Abiitang was from Sagamok. She came to 'Zhawaanige (the Long South Portage/Channel) in 1872 to marry my Mishomis (Grandfather), James Bimaadjiwan, who was born in 'Zhawaanige in 1856. The Bimaadjiwans were already established in 'Zhawaanige for over 500 years. Bimaadjiwans are said to be the 'Chiefs Line' since time immemorial. My Grandfather James Bimaadjiwan was Chief of the 'Zhawaanige (Shawanaga First Nations). All the Chiefs today in 'Zhawaanige are Bimaadjiwans. My sister Veronica was telling me the last time I saw her that she thinks our Grandfather was not the 'Chief' but the 'Chief Councillor' at that time. My Doodoom (Mother) was alone in Noopiming/Mtigwaki (bush/forest) looking for Mashkiki (Medicine) she needed for her well-being and the well-being of her newborn baby. The Mashkiki (Medicine) she was looking for was the root of Ode'imin-ojiibik (the Heartberry, the Strawberry Root) which works like a tonic giving her the good stuff to feed her baby from her Doodooshim (Breasts). The Ode'imin-ojiibik (Strawberry Root) can only be gathered when just a touch of red shows around the berry's small green crown/her hat. 11 5) I declare I am Niizho Midewi (2nd Degree/Teaching Degree) in the Gichi Niswe Ishkode Midewigaan (Three Fires Grand Medicine Lodge). When we are accepted into the Midewigaan, we are in it for life even into death. We make a lifetime commitment to always guard, defend, protect, and honour our Indigenous Good Lifeway, Ojibwe Mino Bimaadiziwin. There are many stories in our introductions as they contain our genealogy and express who we are not only to other people in this physical world/reality, but to all Anishinaabe Akiing (Creation), Jiibay/Jiichaak Akiing (Soul/Spirit World) and Gwanaajwiinge (Beautiful Place). The Importance of Ojibwemowin (Our Sacred Sound) Using Ojibwemowin (our Sacred Sound) in our introduction is a passive way to maintain our place in space and time. We use Ojibwemowin (our Sacred Sound) to express the Sacredness of our language, Our Sound. This is the reason Ojibwe words are used throughout this doctoral research project. My use of Ojibwemowin (our Sacred Sound) is a strong statement of decolonization. Using the language in this way helps change and heal the trauma caused by the hurt, pain, scars, and sorrows inflicted on us through colonial diseases, medicines, and the residential school experience. Even though the focus of loss of cultural is on 'residential schools', institutionalization of disease infected (tuberculosis) small children, like myself, to sanitariums for the 'cure' (which never happened for me) caused even more disconnect from Traditional Life. Even though the stigma of colonization will remain with us into the future, our language still remains intact, and it is a powerful tool in our personal decolonization. When I was just small, after I had just returned from Hamilton Mountain Sanitarium, every time I tried to speak Ojibwemowin all my brothers and sisters would laugh at me. They would point at me and call out, 'English Only! English Only!'. I asked my Dede (Father), 'How come they don't like me?'. He said, 'Give it time, they love you, they just don't know it'. Even as a little girl, I felt weird and very guilty because of my enjoyment of learning and being educated. My Dede (Father) told me that education was the most important thing for a 'Good Mind'. He told me that I needed to balance being Ojibwe and Marten Clan/mixed blood. I thought that education 12 would remove my 'Indian-ness' and 'Ojibwe-ness', but it didn't. My Aunties were so kind and good to me, always reassuring me that everything in my life would be okay/alright as long as I believe in Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) and how He does His work. He is Kind, He is Goodness personified and He would never let me down. I truly believe this. When my mind was small, I didn't know how to deal with all the trauma of not knowing who I was. I was on a wicked rollercoaster-ride and I was so confused and I wanted to die. I began therapy at this time (age 13). This continued off and on into my thirties. If I had not turned to our Ojibwe Healing Ways, I don't know if I would still be here today. Today I'm very proud of my own capacity to 'heal' myself and others through Kindness. The resilience I know I have keeps me determined and going strong. Self-reliance and my own ability to accept the bad times along with the good times was so hard to do in the beginning, but I did it. I come from a household of women, I still hear them saying, 'Ojibwe Ikwe always rises to the challenge. If you fall down, don't stay there! If you have to, ask for help.' In the work I do, I count on the help and guidance I receive from Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery), Mishomisag (Grandfathers), Gokoomisag (Grandmothers), Gitiziimag (Ancestors), Gitchi Aya'aag (Old Ones) and N'godoodemag (Our Families). I feel all experiences are Gichi taawaa (Sacred), every day on our own personal journeys we feel all kinds of emotions: anger, sadness, loneliness, hunger, thirst, joy, happiness, and love. This makes Manidoo'ag (Spirits) happy. They want to help. They love us. Manidoo'ag (Spirits) take away all our pains, fears, hurts and sorrows through osmosis. We need to make our Biindaakoojige (Asemaa, Sacred Tobacco Offerings) in reciprocity to Ishkode (Fire), Aki (Earth), Nibi (Water), and Noondin (Wind). This is our first step on the road to seeking out and recapturing our Sacred Sound, Ojibwemowin, our Old Language, the Ultimate Gift from Creation to the Ojibwe people. 13 Chapter 2 An Introduction to Sacred Life Lodge Teachings These Life Lodge Teachings that I am sharing with you were originally given to Jim Dumont's class at Laurentian University in 1991. As a point of reference, I am sharing this original drawing of the 'Sacred Ojibwe Life Lodge Teaching' with his permission: Figure 2: Seven Stages of Life Lodge, Jim Dumont (1992) In this 'Seven Stages of Life Lodge' (Figure 2), we begin on the right side of the diagram (Star World) and move through to the left side of the diagram which is the Spirit World. This 'Life Lodge' depicts our Life Journey from Birth in the Eastern Doorway to Death in the Western Doorway. I also copied this passage and the 'Mide Diagram of the Path of Life' from Chippewa Customs (1970) by Francis Densmore that Jim Dumont shared as part of his course syllabus for 'Life Cycle and Journey of the Spirit' (Laurentian University, 1991): 14 Figure 3: Francis Densmore's (1970) version of the Life Lodge cited by Jim Dumont (1992) These preliminary ideas inserted here give a sense of the magnitude of this Ojibwe psychological Healing Tool. The methods we use as Nenaandawi'iwde (Ojibwe Anishinaabe Healers) to remove and recover from all these hurts is through this Sacred Healing Ceremony. This Healing process/Ceremony is conducted in the most Sacred Manner. We begin in the way that is written in our Minds and our Hearts. This healing process allows us to acknowledge, understand, and accept our past experiences and trauma, and move forward in a Good Way. I drew the following diagram to show my interpretation of my personal journey through the 'Seven Stages of Life' which are: 'The Good Life' (First Birth to Age 6), 'The Fast Life' (Second Stage: Ages 7 'The Elder Good Life' (Seventh Stage: Age 42 and onwards). 15 Figure 4: Seven Stages of Life Lodge, Jacque Lavallee (2021) This Teaching is so Sacred that I have only heard it coming through Jim Dumont, Gitchi (Eastern Grand Medicine Lodge). As Ojibwe Anishinaabe Nenaandawi'iwedag (Ojibwe Traditional Healers) we understand and believe that our whole life experience is mapped/planned out for us within this 'Sacred Lodge of Life'. As Anishinaabeg we are born into this world/this reality through Waabanong Ishkwaandeming (East/Eastern Doorway) and we Ningaabiianong Ishkwaandeming (West/Western Doorway) at death. Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) already had a plan for Anishinaabeg before we were conceived/born. This included all Mankind. Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) and all Spirits feel and experience our emotions through our life, our pain and our happiness too. There are Spirits who are drawn to our different emotions like fear, anger, hurt, pain, sorrow, and happiness and joy. There are specific Spirits who absorb all of these emotions. It is how they operate throughout the Healing Ceremony. I am so in awe, fearful, afraid, scared, zhaagwenimoyaan (careful/shy/not-confident) of sharing this Teaching. I am very respectful and so very honoured to be given this opportunity to share these Sacred Teachings of the Ojibwe Lodge of Life with my peers, faculty, and all students of Indigenous Studies here within the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto (OISE/UT). 'Accommodation' is an enormous task for a Gitche gete 16 Dadibaajimoo'ikwe (Traditional Female Oral Storyteller) and I need to do justice to Miingoominaam (Gift/Teaching) in the most respectful, beautiful manner that I can within the Ojibwe Anishinaabe Aadizooke (Ojibwe Storytelling) method. An Anishinaabe definition of 'accommodation' is being able to discern what part of the teaching is common knowledge and what part is metaphysical/spiritual knowledge. Only an accredited Traditional Knowledge Keeper can discern the difference. A true understanding and great confidence in Manidooke (Ceremony) is of the greatest importance. 'Impeccability' is essential in this kind of healing work. 'Impeccability' means living a good clean (drug/alcohol free) lifestyle that includes great respect for family dynamics. It requires strength, integrity, sacrifice, and perseverance. There is a degree of 'accommodation' within the context of 'impeccability'. If your 'loved one' falls off the wagon as a brother or sister, protocol states that you bend down, pick them up, and help them to regain the balance they need to live a Good Life. When I was eleven, I went off to residential school. My Doodoom (Mother) was still doing Ceremony. When I came back from residential school to the reserve, my sister Veronica would not let me live with my Doodoom (Mother). Veronica never told me why she felt like this. Because I insisted, being seventeen and strong-willed, that I go and stay with my Doodoom (Mother), even just for one night, she said, 'alright then' and drove me to my Doodoom (Mother)'s house. This was on a Friday afternoon. When evening happened, my Doodoom (Mother) said she was going visiting. She told me not to worry about her if she did not come home that night. Saturday afternoon I was cooking when my Doodoom (Mother) came home. She was acting weird, and she started yelling at me and asking why I was in her house. She picked up a knife and attacked me. I was so lucky Spirits were looking after me. My sister Veronica came into the house at that point. She walked over to our Doodoom (Mother) and took the knife out of her hand and said, 'It is Jacque, your girl!'. Veronica looked at me and said, 'This is why you can't live with Mamma'. On our way home, Veronica told me that our Doodoom (Mother) was an alcoholic and that she didn't think she would change. I felt really bad about that, but because of her teachings to me this allowed me to accept her just the way she was. In reference to 'accommodation', when I smudged her house and herself, I did not withhold the Sacred Medicine of that small Ceremony just because she was an alcoholic. Gichi Miigwech (Thank You Very Much)! 17 The truest form of Nanaandewewin (Healing) according to Ojibwe Indigenous Traditional Knowledge is to consider every part of our being: Wiindib (Mind), Ode (Heart), miinawaa (and) Jiibay/Jichaag (Soul/Spirit). As a 'Traditonal Ceremonial Practitioner' doing this kind of Healing work with not only myself, but with all others, requires the greatest understanding of our own humanity while we reach out, teach, and heal using this powerful Ojibwe Healing Tool/Method of the 'Life Lodge Teaching'. It entails guiding/leading a person in the kindest, gentlest way into their past experiences, their physical/emotional trauma four Ojibwe (Sage) and Wiingashk (Sweetgrass). Beginning at Stage One and progressing through to Stage Seven . Our very First Gift, Gizhewe (Kindness), is really put to good use through-out this process. Gentleness and patience are also required to build trust which is essential in this Healing Ceremony. It is a long process. Healing Ceremonies include: Drumming, Healing Songs, and Thanksgiving Prayers. Knowledge of Ojibwemowin by the Nenaadawi'iwe (Healer/Teacher) is also very important in communicating with the 'Healing Spirits'. If the person seeking healing doesn't understand Ojibwemowin, the Ceremony is still done in the Ojibwe Language. The English explanation of this Ceremony needs to take place ahead of time to ensure that the person understands what we are doing in conducting this Ceremony. There is always a Wiikonge (Feast) with the four Ojibwe Traditional Sacred Foods: Odeminan (Strawberries), Maandaamin (Corn), Minoomin (Rice), (wild meat), Giigoonhyag (Fish) or Binewag (Partridge) can also be used at the completion of this Ceremony. G'wiikomiigo Nagamowin (Invitation Song) is sent out to Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery), Gakina Manidoog miinwaa Anishinaabeg (All Spirits and Humans) to come and eat all the Miigim (Food) we brought with us. Everyone is invited to Wiikonge (Feast). We are encouraged to socialize and have a really good time in a show of appreciation. Gbaaksed Manidookewin (Closing Ceremony) is our way of expressing our appreciation. It is essential to say 'Gichi Miigwech'. Last words: 'Niigaaniikina, Niigaanis Akina Gwa (All My Relations)!' 18 Chapter 3 The Good Life Stage 1: Conception to Age Six This first stage of life according to Jim Dumont (Ojibwe Traditional Elder) begins before conception and continues through age six. This 'New Life' is the 'Greatest Gift' from Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) to the Anishinaabeg and as such is to be cherished and loved by everyone forever. We are still really close to Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery), the Spirits, and the Spirit World. We remain close to the Spirits all the days of our life, but more so when we are first born. If this New Life, the Greatest Gift of 'Creation' is not cherished, is denied Love, is not treated well, or is not Respected, this New Life may, can, or will return to the Spirit World (die). Everything is given and provided freely in this 'Good Life' stage. Physical needs, emotional needs, mental needs, and Spiritual needs are all to be met by the New Life's Mother/Father and every family member. Food, shelter, protection, attention, care, and most of all love is to be given by all family members. To be cherished by all is required to keep this 'New Life' happy, content and wanting to remain with us in this reality. If this 'New Life' (Baby) is not cherished by all and experiences any kind of hurt, whether physical or emotional, they have the choice to return to 'Spirit World' through death. In the following diagram, on the right side, we see clouds and stars representing 'Starworld'. The first Circle represents a small baby crawling on all fours into the 'Good Life'. Within this Circle we also see a small stick figure leaning backwards, trying to maintain balance, as he navigates the experiences within this First Stage of Life. 19 Figure 5: 'The Good Life', Stage 1 Jacque Lavallee (2021) This stage was interrupted for me at age three. I had already been infected with tuberculosis and was sent to live in a sanitarium for four years all by myself. It was a complete disconnect from my sacred place and homeland. When I went home at age seven, I didn't know anything about life in the bush or how to get along with my family. I didn't even know about plants, bugs, snakes or animals. Colonization caused a profound disconnect between me and my family when I was sent to the sanitarium for a cure. I blame the colonizers, those who brought diseases with them such as tuberculosis, small-pox, measles, syphilis, gonorrhoea, influenza, and the common cold, all came from Europe across the ocean on the wooden ships to Mishiikenh Minissing (Turtle Island/North America). Alcohol and drugs also came here from across the ocean. Before the coming of the wooden ships to Mishiikenh Minissing (Turtle Island/North America), we did not have alcohol or drugs to use in a recreational way. The loss of Spiritualism happened when the Anishinaabeg became dependent on alcohol to alleviate the shame of not being able to hunt or provide for family. They were hardly capable of even building a Fire. Both Men and Women became slaves to alcohol and in their alcoholic state they failed to care for their children in a Good Way and became totally abusive. Today they suffer greatly from drug addiction, and we all know what a loss that is to the structure of family. In the work that I do, especially when performing Ceremony, it wasn't up to me to withhold Sacred Smoke or Asemaa from the Anishinaabeg, even under the influence. The 20 work that I do sitting on the Elder's Council at Four Winds, a harm-reduction program for Indigenous people living in downtown Toronto, and as Elder-on-the-Street also addresses the fact that as a Traditional Teacher and Practitioner it is not up to me to withhold Sacred Smoke and Asemaa from the Indigenous street people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol. To share my story like this is the same as scratching open old wounds that have hardly healed. I have not shared these stories in this written context before today because they are so painful and hurtful. I made my appearance suddenly on Sunday, June 13th, 1943 at Naakwe Giizhig (High Noon). My Doodoom (Mother) was alone in the bush collecting strawberry root for my arrival when I surprised her by coming when I did. She was looking to see if the small red ring had formed around the top of the strawberry under the green crown. This would tell her that the strawberry roots were ready to gather. As she bent over, I just slipped from her body and landed on the soft green grass in a sack just like a deer. She told me the Manidoo'ag (Spirits) knew me already and were so good to me right from the beginning by providing me with the protection of that sack and that soft sweet-smelling deer grass that made sure I would not suffer any pain and neither would she as my Doodoom (Mother). She called me 'Waabishkaa Odeminenhs' (Little White Strawberry). I was a 'don't put me down baby'. When they finally did put me down on the floor, I was a runner. They said they had to run to keep up with me. To feed me, they had to tie me to a kitchen chair. I was so fast. They then called me 'Bibimsesii\" (Little Whirlwind). Memories The pain and sorrow inflicted on me personally as a baby/small child, began early. I was infected with tuberculosis at the age of three and was separated from my family, my home, my Sacred Landscape for four years while I was a patient at the Hamilton Mountain Sanitarium. It was a total disconnect. I never saw my parents at all during this time. I was so afraid of my Dede and my Doodoom (my Father and my Mother) when they came to take me home because I had no knowledge of parents, mothers and dads. I was so distraught, I screamed and cried and struggled to get away from them. I know now as a grown-up person how it must have hurt them too. At the Hamilton Mountain Sanitarium, my understanding of my own family was lost to me when I was stricken with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is very contagious. As a result, I was taken away from my home and sent away to live and lie quietly in a bed in a sanitarium for four years. They tied 21 me in the bed so I wouldn't move around and struggle, but I did anyway. It was a long, lonely, painful separation. At this time of my life I should have been experiencing a soft 'good' life full of love and affection. The separation from my family, the total disconnect was devastating. I was even ignorant of family life. My communication/social skills and trust in people were just not there. I didn't know what trust was. When I first went to the sanitarium I spoke no english, I only spoke Ojibwemowin (Ojibwe Language, Our Sacred Sound). When I left to return home after four years, I didn't speak any Ojibwemowin, only english. I used to hide and sleep under the bed at the sanitarium because the people would always poke their fingers at me, they would make funny faces at me, and they would knock on the windows if I wasn't looking at them. I really liked the nighttime. I liked the dark because no one could see me. I was only 3-years-old and I was alone. I had no one. The nurses asked me why I stayed under my bed all the time, so I told them I didn't like eyes looking at me or everyone seeing me all the time. The next morning, they hung some makeshift drapes over the window which were just a bit too short, but that was okay. I remember one time when a little Cree boy came to the sanitarium, he couldn't speak english. The brought him to my little white room. When he saw me, he cried out, 'Bi! Bi!'. The nurse asked me what he wanted. I still had an understanding of Ojibwemowin (Our Sacred Sound) which has similarities to the Mashkiigoog (Swampy Cree/Northern Ontario) language so I just told them that I thought he wanted 'Nibi (water)'. Life in the 'sanitarium' is very white, stark, sterile, sanitary and orderly (not conducive to growing a healthy mind or being a fun time). One good thing was the nurses taught me to read and I loved it! They told me I was so smart to learn so fast. Books became my only friends and I loved them. I couldn't walk or run, but I could read. I also loved the nurses for teaching me. Education became my goal as a means to helping myself and other Anishinaabeg (Good Beings). My Gichi Zhezhenh ban (Great Uncle, already deceased), Henry Abiitang from Sagamok, had a great influence on my education. He told me that I really needed to understand the alphabet and numbers and to excel in these two subjects. He also told me that my life is going to be completed as an academic 'teacher'. He was wrong! I am really good with numbers and really good with 22 words. According to Eddie Benton-Benai, Eighth Degree Midewewin and head of the whole Midewigaan (Three Fires Grand Medicine Lodge), I am a 'Very Eminent Ojibwe Traditional Teacher'. 23 Chapter 4 The Fast Life Stage 2: Ages 7-13 The Fast Life means you have to be 'on your toes' which means our senses are very acute and everything comes very fast. This doesn't just mean coming towards us, but also circular (three-hundred-and-sixty-degrees) in all directions. It is like you have hardly any time to experience life in its fullest at this time. It is just too fast for us. Grandmas always reach for their Grandchildren by the ankles and attach them back to Mother Earth. Even though this is a physical experience it is also a spiritual experience for the children. Our Spiritual Grandparents, and Aunties make this real for us. At this time, every old woman becomes our 'Grandmother', our 'Teacher'. She is boss. As we develop within our home environment and with all life in this 'Creation' we are constantly on a life-long learning path/journey. From early morning and throughout our entire day until night-time we are always reminded by our siblings, all those who are 'older', to pay attention to everything. To see, look and watch, to hear, listen and pay attention to every sound and movement is of the greatest importance. Gitiziimaag/Gitche Aya'aag (The Old Ones, Grandfathers/Grandmothers), Teachers, Speakers and Storytellers voices are the most important sounds that we will hear throughout our whole lifetime. As well as all this, we need to be respectful and attentive to our mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters. In return they will be respectful to us as we grow into maturity as Ojibwe-Ininiwag miinwaa Ojibwe-Ikwewag (Good Men and Good Women). All outdoor sounds and movement need our attention because of their great importance: try not to leave the stones untouched or unturned, and we are not to leave one sound, one whisper unheard. We need to be very strict with ourselves. Self-discipline is what we all need in order to survive today. We learn this during the 'Fast Life' because our brains/minds are wide open and receptive to the whole Creation. Gichi Gete Ojibwe Anishinaabeg (Traditional Ojibwe Human Beings) consider this Teaching Sacred through Makadeke (Fasting). When we turn seven, all Traditional Anishinaabesag (our children) start on a weekly basis to wear a black charcoal Circle on our foreheads to signify our sacrifice of food and water for the day. During this 'Fast' life, one day a week, we are invisible, walking in Spirit World, listening and looking for Spirit Direction. 24 In the following diagram, the next stick figure from the right moving to the left is shy, wary, unknowing, and out of balance, but moving forward nonetheless. I also drew a stick figure rushing into the future in the centre of the 'Second Stage' not knowing what there is in store for us. Our trust in our family is so strong. We count on their protection. Figure 6: 'The Fast Life', Stage 2, Jacque Lavallee (2021) Memories I am seven-years-old and I have just returned home from the Hamilton Mountain Sanitarium where I had lived for four years from the ages of three to seven. I cried so hard when my Doodoom (Mother) and Dede (Father) came to pick me up to bring me home. It was a very scary experience going home with strangers. I had no memories of my Doodoom (Mother) and Dede (Father) because I had not seen them at all during my stay at the sanitarium. Four years is forever when you are just a little kid. My time of being apart from my family was so lonely. My journey home was scary too. We spent the night at the King Edward Hotel in Toronto. I went there with my foster parents as a teenager, it was exactly the same. The smell was the same, the sounds were the same. The d\u00e9cor was the same. It was maroon and leather. The smell of leather was very, very strong and the smell of food was terrific. I remember commenting on it to my Dede (Father) about the funny smell when I was seven. He said it was the leather. At home, the smell of hide is very different than the smell of leather. My Dede (Father) just laughed and said, 'Yes, it smelled different'. At home the hides were 'smoked' and that's the smell I remember even 25 today. The smell of smoked hides sends me right to my childhood, to that time that I shared with my Dede (Father). I remember when we went back home to 'Zhaawaanige. We travelled by train and we got there in the middle of the night. It was really scary. We had to come down a big, steep hill in the darkness. Because I was tied to my bed in the sanitarium, I had difficulty walking. I absolutely couldn't run or dance. We went across a road, along a dock, and got into a boat. We went way out in the middle of the water. I fell asleep. When I woke up in the morning, I was in a very strange place. There was lots of kids and I was scared of them. It was an island out in the middle of the Georgian Bay where my Dede (Father) worked. He was a contractor (a builder) and worked all summer out on the Bay. When he told me that he was a 'carpenter', I said, 'Like Jesus?'. He laughed. I told everyone who my Dad was, he was Jesus. In October, we returned home to the Bush in the dark. I kept on asking, 'Where are we going?'. And all at once, in loud voices, they said, 'We already told you, we are going home!'. My Doodoom (Mother) woke us up early in the morning, still dark, and put something in my hand. I closed it up and we stood there in silence until the sun came up. This activity happened four times. On the fourth day, I asked my Doodoom (Mother), 'What are we doing here?'. She was quiet for a while, then she said, 'We are waiting for the day to touch us.' When she said this, a nice soft wind came, and it lifted my hair, and I could feel it on my face. I started to yell, 'I can feel it! I can feel it!'. My brothers and sisters laughed at me, but even they couldn't take away this beautiful feeling. This was my introduction to Spirit. My Dede (Father) was very kind and gentle with me. Whenever we went walking, he would always hold my hand and he answered all my questions. He never made me feel bad. My older sisters were upset and mad at me because he paid me this attention. He made his way out the Western Doorway when I was only nine years old. Out of my nine years of life I only knew him for five years total, three of those years were when I was just a baby and four years were when I was at the sanitarium. I'm so sad. I didn't have anyone to hold my hand anymore. 26 When I finally got better and well enough and came back from the sanitarium to my home, my sacred place, my family didn't even know me at all. My other siblings (brothers and sisters) sometimes told me to go back to where I came from, wherever that was. It was total rejection even from my own family. They called me stupid and dumb because I didn't know anything. I didn't know about bugs, snakes, or plants. I didn't even know what to eat. My Dede (Father) heard them being mean to me. He told them not to say those hurtful words because it wasn't my fault that I got sick and was away from them at the sanitarium for so long (4 years). During the summer, we didn't stay at any house on the reserve, we lived at summer camp in the middle of the Georgian Bay. In late October, we returned to the Bush and to my mom's little house. We all had our own little beds in the 'sleeping room'. There were twelve small beds, six on the back wall, three beds on each side, and a great big bed in the middle. That's where my Doodoom (Mother), Dede (Father), and bibins (baby) slept. I remember telling my Doodoom (Mother) that we were 'inside the cake' because how the beds were all stacked up together. I slept just below my sister Veronica. In the middle of the night, I woke up because I could hear a certain sound and I sat right up and hit my head on Veronica's bed. She woke up and asked me what was wrong. I told her that the 'dutch ladies' were going to work. She stopped and she listened and she said, 'It's a train'. I said, 'Nope. It's the 'dutch ladies' going to work!'. The next night, she woke me up in the middle of the night and took me on a long walk, about half a mile, to the train station. We sat on the bench that was there and I asked her, 'So, what are we doing here?'. She said, 'Shhhh! Don't say a word'. So, we sat in silence in the dark for about ten minutes. Then I could hear the 'dutch ladies' coming to work real fast: 'shuk, shuk, shuk, shuk'. And it went right past. My sister looked at me and said, 'It's a train. How come you said it's the 'dutch ladies' going to work?'. So, I told her about the short curtains in my little white room. I said, 'Every morning before the sun came up, I could hear a sound coming down the hall. And the sound went, shuk, shuk, shuk, shuk. At the bottom of my drapes the 'dutch ladies' appeared to be going to work. I could see them beneath my drapes, the ones that were too short. She said she was going to show me something when we got home. At breakfast time, she told everybody about my story. My Dede (Father) and my Niikaanis (Brother) both thought it might have been some kind of a buggy/cart 27 with wheels. It might have been the cleaning cart. Maybe the ball-bearings were broken and that is what made the 'shuk, shuk' sound. Veronica went running to the big kitchen, she came back carrying a can of cleanser. On the cleanser, there was a picture of the 'dutch ladies' going to work. That's Old Dutch Cleanser. When I was nine, my nephew Normie was born at home. There were just good, kind, gentle women, women we referred to as Aunties (Midwives). At that time, I was responsible for the water temperature, making sure that the water was never too cold, that it was just right. I remember in the sanitarium, when the nurses would check out the water, they would dip their elbow in 'to test it'. When I was doing the water, I remember dipping my elbow in and my sisters asking why I was doing that, and I said, 'Just testing it'. So, as I was changing the water, I had just bent down to put the warm water on the table at the bottom of the bed where my sister was laying when this 'something' came shooting out of the covers and landed right in my hands. I was so scared. I was yelling and saying, 'What is it! What is it!' All the women laughed and said, 'It's a baby!' I looked down at it and I saw it was round and shaped like an egg. Yelling, I said, 'No, it is not a baby!'. They said, 'Put him in the water'. So, I put him in the nice warm Cedar water and his arms and his legs opened up and he put back his head and cried. I'm so excited and I say, 'Yes! It is a baby! It is a baby!'. All the women looked at me and laughed. Protocol There were no men present in the house during the birthing, not even a Fire Keeper. As soon as the baby cried, the Dede (Father) came rushing into the house followed by his father and his brothers. My brothers came into the house too. The Dede (Father) went straight to the baby and looked at him. He touched the baby's chest and said, 'I promise to care for you all my life'. The Grandfather did likewise. All of his Uncles and his Brothers and our Brothers all made this same promise and touched the baby on his chest. There are other protocols involved, one of them which is outstanding, is how the new Mother is positioned so that she does not expose her 'Sacred Doorway' directly towards the Western Doorway. When the Mother is giving birth, she is positioned so that her body is facing the West-North-West Direction so that the baby makes his entrance through the Waabanong Ishkwaandeming (Eastern Doorway) into the Sacred Circle of Life 28 Chapter 5 Wandering and Wondering Life Stage 3: Ages 14-21 This stage is called the 'Wandering and Wondering Life' because we are looking for some kind of guidance for our life besides from our Doodoom (Mother) and Dede (Father). It is at this time that we start listening and responding to voices/instructions other than those of our immediate family. That is the 'wandering' part. When we question their responses, that is the 'wondering' part or our research. So, you will notice the four stick figures chasing each other around in circles in the 'Third Stage' of my diagram (below). Figure 7: 'Wandering, Wondering Life', Stage 3, Jacque Lavallee (2021) Memories I came on my 'time' just after my tenth birthday and it was in the Spring that I had this experience of my first 'Moon-time'. 'Moon-time' is how Ojibwe Ikwe referred to menstruation. A woman's 'Moon-time' is the most Sacred event in a woman's life. Her body is changing physically to prepare for the 'New Life' she will have in the future. Before the 1950s, this was the time of celebration in the life of every Ojibwe Ikwewag. It is at this time that a woman is counselled by older women, Aunties, Grandmas, and older Sisters about all the things that she needs to be aware of from now on. The protocol is really extensive. 29 Before my first Moon Time I didn't consider myself as being any different from the men or the boys. I thought I was the same. I thought I was a boy! My sisters laughed and said, 'You are a Beautiful New Woman, Gewnaagwinge Ishinn Ikwe, not a boy.' I told them, 'I can't be a woman yet. Veronica, I can't be a woman yet because I need to be an eloquent, beautiful Old Man like our Great Uncle Henry.' He looked after all the written business of the 'reserve', the 'books' he called them. His name was, G'chitaawaa Onaagaanhs. Protocol During my first year on my 'time', I did not go anywhere for seven days each month. While under the influence of Gokoomis Dibik-Giizis (Grandmother Night-time Sun), who controls the Nibi (all the waters on this planet) including the blood that flows in the human body, I did not cook Feast Foods, I didn't play or try to be funny. I didn't do anything. I was taught to do beadwork, to sew, to tan hides, to keep the house clean, and to dress the furs of little animals. The traditional protocol is, when you are on your time, there are no males present. I heard that this was because they are extremely afraid of women on their time (hearsay). They say the men were afraid of the women because a woman on her time is very powerful and she can take all their magic away from them if she wants to. You do not go to dances where the men are. You are never the only woman in men's presence. You learn to keep a calendar, you become aware of all the Grandmother Moon Teachings, and you begin wearing a skirt or a dress. I didn't have to wear a dress any other time except when was on my flow/menstruating, but I always had to wear a dress or skirt to Ceremony. Protocol states that we need to accept who we are as women. There is no getting away from menstruation. When Two-Spirit, non-Binary, and Trans persons are in this female productive state and during this 'Moontime', they are female. The female of her household will strictly observe this protocol. Two-Spirited, Non-Binary, and Trans persons are always respected before and after their 'Moon Times'. Once we are post-menopausal, we as women can wear jeans/pants/trousers any time we want even during the performance of Ceremony. 30 Memories It was just before summer break, June 28, 1953, when I was sitting at my desk at school and I thought I was wetting myself. My arm shot up the air and I ran out of the school house, straight to the outhouse. As I pulled my underwear down, I saw the blood. I was so scared, I went running home, straight through the Bush, across two hunting grounds. I was screaming and yelling the whole time. My older sister, Alfreda, heard me and came running to save me. When she saw me, she asked, 'What's wrong?'. I told her I had been shot. She just went running off ahead of me to tell my Doodoom (Mother) I had been shot. My Doodoom (Mother) came running and asked me where I had been shot. When I showed her my underwear, she told me, 'Every woman gets shot there'. She ran me right past our house and took me straight to the Cedar Bush. She didn't even let me go inside the house because I was so powerful I could take all of the magic and happiness out of our house. I was that powerful even though I was just a little ten-year-old girl. I was so familiar with this Cedar Bush. It was where I did my Fasting, my sacrificing water, food, and human company. This is where I had my Dreams about what my future was going to be like. I could see how I would be a good mother to carry kindness in front of me and to always show my big, shiny teeth. I had already been Fasting since I was seven years old. I would Fast one day a week, usually Saturday. I wasn't allowed to have anything to eat, no food and absolutely no water. During my first day-long Fast, my Doodoom (Mother) would cover me with the Smoke of our Sacred Medicines: Asemaa (Sacred Tobacco), Giizhig (Cedar), and Mashkodewashk (Sage). When she finished 'smoking me up', she would take a piece of charcoal and rub it right in the middle of my forehead. I wore that charcoal circle all day. The people I met wouldn't even greet me. When I asked my Doodoom (Mother) about this, she told me that when that black circle was on my forehead, I was invisible. I would forget about the charcoal circle. When they offered me food, my hand would just go out to take it. They would smile and tell me, 'Maybe tomorrow!'. They liked to tease me all the time. Having the charcoal circle on my forehead was to inform Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) and all Manidoog (Spirits) what I was doing so they would give me guidance and blessings for my future. I was turned into Spirit when the charcoal circle was on my forehead. This is just one of the ways my Doodoom (Mother) helped me to be who I am today. I am forever grateful to her for her love and support. I had the freedom to travel in 31 Jiibekaan (Spirit World) because the black dot on my forehead told all Spirits my mind was not quite formed yet, and that I was asking for their help for my future. As a Ishkenii Ikwe (Beautiful New Woman), a teenager (ages 11-14), I was again removed from my Doodoom (Mother) and my Family and Sacred Landscape. I was forced to live at 'St. Mary's Training School for Delinquent White Girls'. This was also residential school for 'Brown Indian Girls' in Toronto. This school was intended for wicked 'white' girls not for Ojibwe Ikwewag (Ojibwe Women). The residential school experience was the greatest pain and injustice we ever had to endure as a whole race of 'people', the Indigenous Peoples of the world. We suffered greatly during this time. This really broke us down emotionally, physically, and psychologically: our whole Life Way! Knowledge of all our family members, Grandparents, Mothers, Fathers, and all our Brothers, Sisters, Aunties, Uncles, Cousins, and all household pets which are essential to Ojibwe Abinoojiimnan (children) was nearly lost because of the total disconnect of children from their most Sacred Environment. This is so hurtful even today! When the wooden ships landed on the shores of our beautiful Mishiikenh Minissing (Turtle Island/North America), the grim, dark days of the residential schools and deadly diseases had begun. We were displaced, removed from our N'go Doodemag (family), N'Endaaying (home), and our Daakiimnaang (Sacred place) in this Anishinaabe Akiing (Anishinaabe Creation) by the white folk, newcomers, colonists, settlers, the canadian government, and the christian churches.1 This created a huge rift, a total disconnect of all that was essential for the Anishinaabeg Mino-Biimaadiziwin (the Human Being's Good Lifeway). Through this removal of our children, Indigenous peoples were stripped of everything that was essential for the Anishinaabeg here on Mishiikenh Minissing (Turtle Island/North America). We couldn't live in the 'Sacred' manner that was given to us by Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) if we didn't have the understanding of Kindness and everything that it means. Freedom to speak our Sacred Languages and the ability to raise our children in the Sacred manner that was given to us was taken away, ripped away from 'US' the Indigenous People under the guise of 'education'. Our Mino Bimaadiziwin (Good Life Way) is a really beautiful life way that was given to us here on Mishiikenh Minising (Turtle Island/North America) by Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery). 1I deliberately avoid capitalizing words associated with 'canada' and 'christian' because it is my own personal way to passively resist ongoing colonization by these institutions. 32 We were denied our love, our connection and our attachment to Doodoom Aki (Mother Earth). We have our Scared Place which we have occupied, lived upon since time immemorial. The Sacred responsibility of Ojibwe given by Gizhem Manidoo (Great Kind Mystery) of taking care of Doodoom Aki (Mother Earth) was ripped away from us, breaking our Hearts. This was simply because the newcomers didn't understand or remember their responsibilities to the 'Creation'. The colonizer had no idea of the Sacredness of Doodoom Aki (Mother Earth). They did not know how to care for her. They thought they knew Mother Earth better than the Indigenous Peoples who have always lived here since time immemorial. This Sacred Place that we call Doodoom Aki (Mother Earth) is our Beloved Homeland. We know today that they did not know how to care for Her because they did not consider Her a 'living being'. The injustice inflicted on her by the colonizer is shameful. The damage and destruction they have caused Her is beyond repair. We will never be able to fix her. It is almost too late for our Mother Earth. It is too late for Our Greatest Doctor, Our Healer, Gichi Waabishkaa Makwa (Great White Bear). The colonizers have inadvertently ruined our beautiful Doodoom Aki (Mother Earth) forever. Where is the Respect? The Indigenous Peoples today are doing our best to keep our 'Mother Earth' beautiful, perfect, and strong. We send up words of Thanksgiving on a daily basis. Every day through Manidooke (Ceremony) we let Her know how much we Love Her and how much we care. We are to use only that which is given to us freely from Her Body without the use of metal tools. We were to take only as much as we needed to survive. For everything we take from the body of Doodoom Aki (Mother Earth), we need give in reciprocity a small gift of 'Asemaa' (Sacred Tobacco). These protocols of Biindaakoojige (Reciprocity) are still observed by many Ojibwe today as Asemaa Nitam (Tobacco first). This means that a small offering of 'Asemaa' (Sacred Tobacco) is given to our Doodoom Aki (Mother Earth) whenever we take from Her Body. We are to keep Her forever beautiful, clean and pure. The total disconnect from this 'Mino-Biimaadiziwin' (Good Life Way) through the 'residential school' experience is considered today as 'GENOCIDE'. The removal of children from their Sacred Homeland was and still is the 'worst of the worst'. The total disruption of the Good Life Way of all the Indigenous Peoples of the World was cruel, deliberate, totally inhumane, and an absolute injustice. I am still suffering. I don't like saying, 'Oh poor me/Oh poor us' because I am a proud Ojibwe Anishinaabe Ikwe. I am strong and resilient. I don't like feeling angry, hateful, or 33 sad. I want to be happy and loving. I don't like feeling helpless or hopeless, I want to be Zoongode (Strong Heart). I will always hold my Asemaa (Sacred Tobacco) in my hand and I will always put Kindness in front of everything. We have suffered immensely and we are still struggling today to regain all that was taken from us. Our Sacred Sound, our Languages, were almost forgotten. Total genocide was committed here, for real. This is our reality now for true. We will survive, we are resilient. We are all Zoongode'ewe (Strong of Heart). When I was eleven, my Nimiisenh (Sister) Diana just started high school in Parry Sound. Just after school started, in October, the Indian Agent and the Health Nurse came to our house in the Bush and put Diane and I in the car and just drove away. I don't even remember them speaking to my Doodoom (Mother) or telling her that they were taking us away to school. I thought that we were just going to town, to Parry Sound, to buy our winter clothes, but we drove right past Parry Sound. I was worried, so I asked, 'Where are you taking us?'. They did not respond. They just kept driving silently. When I asked again, 'Where are we going?', the nurse said, 'We are going to a school where you will live. You will be warm all winter, have a nice clean bed to sleep in, and food to eat every day'. I didn't think too much of that because we had those things at home: warmth, shelter, and food to eat. So, I didn't see that as a good excuse for us being taken there. What about my 'Fasting Time', my 'Moon Time'? Would I still be able to do the Ceremonies? How? The residential schools, the canadian government, and the christian churches broke all of our Sacred Traditional protocols by removing Anishinaabe Abinoojiinhyag (Indigenous Children) from their homes, their Gitiziimag (Parents), and their Sacred Homeland. The colonizers had no understanding of the Sacredness of Anishinaabe Life Way, especially the connection of Grandparents and Children. The colonizers saw this removal as being beneficial to Indigenous children by providing them with what they saw as a 'good education'. The school day at the residential school was very rigid, there was no kindness. The educational part of residential school consisted of three hours of daily instruction every morning. That was not enough time to learn western education. The rest of the day was devoted to working hard at manual labour doing laundry, kitchen work, ironing, sewing, and factory work. It was all very difficult for us kids from the Bush. This was approach to 'education' was unkind, vicious, and scary. Today, the 34 approach of 'western education' is unchanged beyond the overt use of corporal/physical punishment on children. The same violence continues on an emotional, mental, and spiritual level which continues to have violent and lasting effect on all children. Through the residential school experience, the daily reminders of our connections to 'Spirit', Mother Earth, and the 'Good Life Way' were almost lost, completely destroyed by the colonizers, the canadian government, and the christian churches. This 'total disconnect' happened to all Ojibwe/Indigenous Children of Doodoom Aki (Mother Earth), all over the world. From the ages of 4-18, we were torn from our Loving Families, our Sacred Homelands, Territories, and our most Sacred Environment. The mass removal of Ojibwe/Indigenous children from mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, and most of all from our grandmothers and grandfathers was mean, vicious, and totally inhumane. This was cruelty. When the children and grandchildren were taken away, grandparents lost the will to live. They could not bear to be separated from their children and grandchildren who were their only reason to live and they just took themselves off into the bush to perish. Life was no longer worth living without their babies. They did not even say, 'Baamaapii Gaanaawaabmin (See You Sometime in the Future). In Ojibwemowin, there is no word for 'Good-bye'. In an Ojibwe family, when a baby is born, they could be your niece, your nephew, or grandchild, all of us take ownership of that baby regardless of who their parents are. Blood makes them 'our babies'. Because of the family bonds, these actions by the colonists continue to create great sorrow for families, whole communities, and whole nations today. We need only read the current news about the ongoing discovery of unmarked graves at residential schools. When I returned home at age 17, I asked my Doodoom (Mother), 'How come you let them take Diana and me away to that school?'. It was the first time I had seen her cry. It almost broke my heart. It was at that time that I could relate to how N'gitziimag (My Parents) felt when they came to pick me up from the sanitarium when I was seven. I was so scared of them. They were strangers to me. I hadn't seen them for four years. I knew right then that it was not the fault of my Doodoom (Mother). When she told us there was nothing she could do to keep us, we all 35 cried. Only the indian agent had the right.2 The canadian government had the right. The christian church had the right. We, the Ojibwe People had NO RIGHTS. I hated the indian agent, the canadian government, and the christian churches, it was a terrible feeling. That was the first time I could put a name on that feeling of total helplessness. It was against my Heart and my Soul/Spirit to be in that emotional, helpless state of being. I decided at that time that I would never allow myself to feel like that ever again. This state of helplessness exists on every reservation and every city on Turtle Island and the world. Before the wooden ships landed, all of the 'Old People' were in charge of their own households, their communities, and their Sacred Landscape. Because of the nature of colonialism, all 'brown peoples' on Turtle Island were disempowered and disrespected by the colonists and their governing bodies. The residential school experience removed all rights from all the Old People and left them powerless and in a hopeless situation. Today there are many Indigenous academic scholars who have yet to empower themselves to speak up within all colonized/educational fields of study. Because I come from a Traditional Family, my Teachings and Instructions were intact before the residential school. This Traditional Knowledge guided me through the colonial educational system. If I did not have this Traditional upbringing, higher education would not have made any difference to my life. Because of my Marten Clan attachment, I am on the 'edge/border' between the Bush of the Anishinaabeg and the colonized world of the white peoples. It has allowed me the freedom to choose education as a means of empowerment to myself and all Anishinaabeg. In saying this, it needs to be understood that the teaching and sharing of Ceremony is the means to ensuring our children to come within the next Seven Generations to still maintain this retained Ojibwe Traditional Knowledge. What I teach and share within the confines of the university are directly connected to Traditional Indigenous Knowledge. The only way to create positive change is to understand the need for change. The lives of many Indigenous Nations rely on bringing understanding to all peoples of the world. It is so important to share our Mino-Biimaadiziwin (Good Life Way) with all those who will listen. The basis of this dialogue is my life as an Ojibwe Anishinaabe person, and how I came to this place we call Mishiikehn Minising (Turtle Island/North America) in this reality. 2 In the same way that I do not capitalize 'canadian' and 'christian', I do not capitalize the title of 'indian agent' as my form of ongoing resistance to colonization by these authorities. 36 Protocol Until the age of 18, we are all under the dictates of all those who are older (our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, aunties, and uncles). Moving from 17 to 18 years old as a teenager into adulthood I had my whole family telling me what not to do and giving me all kinds of instructions. It was very hard and confusing. In this state I didn't know whether I was coming or going. At this age I learned to say, 'No'. The transition from a teenager to an adult happened between my eighteenth and nineteenth birthdays. For the first time in my life, I am experiencing FREEDOM to do as I wished, as long as I was in the house at dark time (10 o'clock), but that was the same for everybody else too even if you were 22 or older and a woman. During that year of transition between 18 and 19, all thoughts were focussed on turning 19 and listening to people's instructions on how to survive. All the protocol and instructions in social graces were given at that time by everyone. It was so confusing to have all these voices coming at me all at the same time. This was when I was given the teachings of three-hundred-and-sixty-degree vision and all the Circle Teachings, nothing was left out. So that was a heavy growing year. Even coming on my Moontime was not as scary as turning 18. Having to understand these boundaries, limitations, consequences, and taking ownership of every wrong thing do we and for all my own thoughtless actions. It was up to me to know how to deal with these problems. I needed to make 'restitution' for the mistakes I made. During this seven year stage, everything that I learned through the teachings and white education was done. It was also during this time I was encouraged to look at, relive, recount my 'Good Life' and 'Fast Life'. This caused me to look again at the story of my birth, and question 'Who was I? How did I become who am I today? Why is it so important to remember?'. I will begin with this story of my birth. I must start with where and how I was born and why all the adults in my home and community took charge of me and my life. My path is non-linear/cyclic, so my life-story is cyclic not straight. Our lives are always in flux and forever moving forward even as Mother Earth and the entire Indigenous Cosmos moves forward. Most of this work has been retracing the stages of my life from birth to where I am now. 37 Daamaagiitaadaa (We should begin). Never in a million years, when I was just a little kid, did I imagine myself as a teacher, I was so family-oriented. Having many children and raising them up was the most important thing to me, it was my major objective, because I knew I could be the best mother and do the best job raising them. I had so much self-determination as a child. I knew I would be an excellent mother with all the Anishinaabe Traditional Teachings already in place. That is the pedagogy. I used all the skills I learned in my own upbringing to raise my own children to be kind before anything. Kindness is for everyone. To never say 'no' to your own child was so hard to learn and to use every day. To be Kind is to be the best Anishinaabe person. Growing up in a Anishinaabe family means you have the responsibility to look after and care for anyone who is younger than yourself, but in residential school, this was not how things were done. In residential school, no one could or would protect the small ones because the other girls too were afraid of the punishment they got for standing up to the nuns. We were put in solitary confinement for up to seven days at a time when we stepped in to protect the small ones who were getting whipped. The other girls were afraid of that, but I was not afraid to be alone. Even when I was in solitary confinement, I would make everything okay by just remembering I was Anishinaabe. I appreciated the time alone. It was like fasting when I was there. Residential school was demoralizing and dehumanizing because it did not allow us to be Giizhewe (Kind). Kindness is the most important feeling that we can ever have as Human Beings. Helping all who can't help themselves and giving comfort wherever and whenever we can. Anishinaabe thinking is so attached to place. The overall mandate of residential school was to take all our small ones away from their families, their sacred homeland, and place. The severing of the connection between the children, their families, and their sacred homeland was so intense. Survivors are still affected in this same way today. They felt robbed of their connection to their Ngo Doodemag (our Families) and Doodoom Aki (Mother Earth). I experienced a total disconnection from my home, family, and place in our Traditional Sacred Territory. If I hadn't had the 'traditional teachings' I wouldn't have survived residential school. I just had to keep that 38 piece alive within myself. Nimisenh (my sister) Diana was such a great Oshkaabewis (Helper), always there with a remembered teaching to share. She was my most beloved Anishinaabe (Good Human Being). She was brutally murdered by close friends and her children (?) in 1989 due to alcoholism and drug addiction. As a kid, I was pretty set in my own belief system: Ojibwe Anishinaabe Giikendman (Our Sacred Teachings). Everything I knew about ceremonies, how we looked, how we dressed, and our Sacred Teachings I put in a basket, where I kept them safe and took care of them. Even as a small child I was smart enough to disallow anything that was not Indigenous, like Western belief system, into my basket. To stay connected physically, I put physical things in the basket as well, like a stick, an old dried up rose, or an old dried-up mushroom. The rose represents love in Anishinaabe tradition. The mushroom kept the longest, and there are medicine teachings about the spores that grow on them. When you breathe them in, you are asking for the land to be healthy and whole, by doing this you are also receiving blessings. I kept myself grounded by opening the basket every once-in-a-while and re-examining the teachings that were there. I would open it up and all the other girls would laugh and say that it was nothing but an old empty basket. I knew it was full of good teachings. The only one who understood me was my Nimisenh (Sister) Diana. She was my best human being. She was everything to me because of the help that she gave me. She would go out and get some leaves from the little Cedar Tree for the little ceremony after my 'Moontime': 'Shhh don't let anyone know what we're doing, don't tell.' When a woman is on her 'Moontime' she spends all the time by herself thinking about her future. Why do I like babies? I was told about non-interference, not to fix anyone, don't tell them what to do, don't eat Strawberries, don't say no to your babies, don't yell or swear at little kids. New mothers stay with their Babies for six years, just focussing on her Baby. Her Sisters make sure she has all she needs during this time. If the Mother gets sick during this time, another Mother is invited to visit us with her Baby. She feeds her Baby and she feeds our Baby too. The Mother is fed all the best foods, lots of berries and fish. When a Baby first starts eating solid food, the Grandmothers chew up the food for them and take it from their mouth to the mouth of the Baby. We didn't have food processors to make baby food, that's why Grandmas chewed their Grandbaby's food. 39 40 Berry Fast When Anishinaabe Ikwe begin to flow or begin their Moontime, every time Gokoomis D'biki Giizis (Grandmother Moon) comes full in the sky we sacrifice our food and water. We sacrifice human companionship and all social activity. Once a month this is the protocol upheld by all Anishinaabe Ikwe. For one year, she gives up/sacrifices eating strawberries. She makes this sacrifice for the whole year so the Anishinaabe people will continue to have strawberries seven generations into the future. It is a big occasion for young women. When I went through my berry fast, I was oh so proud. When I came off my fast, all the women rubbed my whole face with strawberries. I had strawberries in my hair, in my armpits, in my neck, all down my back and down my legs right to my toes. I smelt like strawberries for a whole week. Miigwech! A Story of Cedar When Nimisenh (Sister) Diana and I first arrived at the residential school, the only thing that I thought about was 'What am I going to do about my Moontime?'. Diana and I talked about it and decided we should look for Giizhig (Cedar). Diana and I found a small little Cedar Tree. While we stood there and looked at it, the groundskeeper saw us and he came to ask us, 'What are you doing here?'. So, we told him about Cedar Tree and how Sacred She was and what we used Her for. To us, the Cedar Tree is a Woman. Her job is to take care of the women. We can use Cedar for tea, for eating, for washing your hair, to protect ourselves from negativity by putting it in our shoes, and it brings comfort by chewing the tips between our teeth in times of stress. It was very stressful there. The groundskeeper just walked away. The next day, Nimisenh (Sister) Diana and I went to look at Cedar Tree. There was a little white wire fence around her. When the groundskeeper saw Nimisenh (Sister) Diana and myself looking at Cedar Tree he said, 'Now nobody will cut Her down. They will be careful.'. Residential School was dehumanizing because it did not allow us Anishinaabe Kids to be kind or helpful. We absolutely could not hug or touch one another. We would be punished by having to stand up and not sit down all the time. We were told that 'Kindness' was of no value to us because we were 'savages' and as long as we remained 'wild indians' life would always be difficult and harsh. It would be better if we were to forget our Anishinaabe heritage. Residential 41 school did not take Traditional Knowledge or Traditional Thinking away from me because I was so stubborn. It became more like a treasure, not unlike the things I kept in my basket. From the ages of 11-14, Nisimenh (Sister) Diana and I were at St. Mary's Training School for Delinquent (white) Girls. Age 13 was when therapy began for me three times per week. My sister went home and left me alone at this time. When I turned 14, I became a ward of the catholic children's aid. I had four sets of foster parents in three weeks. This was culture shock. When we know certain things or when we obtain certain knowledge through hearing, seeing, doing, and understanding, we need to share this information with all Peoples and all Nations. How we share this Traditional Knowledge is through Ceremony and Storytelling. Storytelling is teaching in its finest state. This kind of teaching and Ceremony (methodology/pedagogy) is for all, from tiny babies to university students and forever into the future. Ceremony never ages. It is always and will be. It is the past, present, and future in the beautiful methodology of our Sacred Seasonal Circles/Cycles. Memories When my Nisimenh (Sister) came on her Moontime, period, menstruation she was thirteen years old. I was eleven years old. Diana suffered greatly from cramps and was placed in the infirmary whenever she came on her flow, Moontime, period. Ms. Nora the nurse always let me visit with Diana when she was, what Ms. Nora called, 'infirmed'. I know they gave her pills to ease her pain because she told me this. She asked me if my medication was helping me with my problems, Attention Deficit Hyper Active (ADHA). I told her I didn't think so because I was still the same person. We were both in the infirmary at the same time every month because we came on our time at the same time every month because of our periods. We were told that we were now to call our 'Moontime' 'periods'. I took care of the Cedar for myself and her. Protocol In Anishinaabemowin, our 'Moontime' is called Miskwiiwiwin applies to the 'Coming Out' Ceremony. Before we leave our beds, we spit into the palms of our hands, and we rub our faces and the soles of our feet. We spit on our fingers and put it on the crown of our head. Four small 42 pieces of Cedar are placed on the floor. We step on the four pieces of Cedar and say, 'Gichi Miigwech' to each piece of Cedar as we step on them. We perform this small Ceremony for the well-being of all our relations in this Universe and Seven Generations into the future. We are so powerful that we cannot place our feet directly on the floor in case we damage our Mother Earth. We are so powerful, we can take all Mother Earth's energy and gifts for ourselves at this time. We stop her gifts, which are water, food, medicines, and comfort/nurturing. As Anishinaabe Ikwe, we always need to be mindful of our 'taking away power' during our Moontime. 43 Chapter 6 Truth Life Stage 4: Ages 21-27 At this stage of our life, we begin to sort through all accumulated Traditional Knowledge. We return to Stage 1, the Good Life, what we learn here is balance. Stage 2, the Fast Life, is all about trust: Who warns us? Our whole family does. Who catches us when we keep tripping and falling? Our whole family does. Zaagiiyaa (Love) is always expressed in many ways: just a small rub on your shoulder or a small smile. Stage 3, the Wondering and Wandering Life, is revisited. We remember all those who ran with us. We remember those ones who caused us to stop to help them. We remember to hug them and hold their hands. We sift through the painful, sorrowful times. We check out the times of happiness and how to hold on to the kind and gentle times, the loving times. My daughter Michelle was born during this time. This Stage is called the 'Truth Life' because we are utilizing/employing/using all the teachings we have received up to this point. We are fully in charge of our life and the lives within our household from the oldest person to the smallest animal. We get to find out at this time the truth in the teachings that we were given especially when it comes to children. In my diagram below, the Truth Life Circle represents a single Human Being approaching the future with confidence. 44 Figure 8: 'The Truth Life', Jacque Lavallee (2021) Protocol The Anishinaabe protocols regarding childcare/child-rearing are very different from the western/colonized approaches to childcare. The first thing is we need to show our shiny teeth to our babies all the time. We need to take care of our babies as soon as they start crying. A mother's responsibilities are solely to her child. She doesn't have to cook, she doesn't have to clean, or do the laundry. She just needs to look after her baby. We cannot deny our babies anything. We cannot say 'No!'. Memories At 22 I became a new young mother and I was very proud. I loved my baby already and was so happy to have him come into my life. I was 'over the moon' happy that he chose me to be his mother. I was so honoured and humbled. My happiness was short lived. My baby was stolen away from me, taken away from me by strangers in the hospital. I wasn't even allowed to see him or hold him. My first baby never even met me. Everyone even the doctors and nurses said I wouldn't be able to care for him. I couldn't keep him simply because I was an ignorant, brown, Indian woman. I was a savage, too young and not capable of caring for a new baby, let alone raising him up to be a Kind Man. They said they already had parents for him and I would never have to worry about those things. I loved my first baby (a boy) the one who was taken from me at birth. This was the first time as an adult that I fell into deep 'depression'. Only now do I 45 understand how my Doodoom (Mother) must have felt when the indian agent took my Nimisenh (Sister) Diana and myself away from her to go to the residential school. As a Mother, a Grandmother, and now a Great-Grandmother I find my confidence is still being undermined by the canadian government, the colonizers, and the christian churches. It is not only me, my baby, and my family who have been hurt in this manner, but all the Indigenous Babies who still don't know who they are today. How do we reconcile this? How do we forgive this horrible injustice? However we accomplish this act of forgiveness, it will never make-up for the terrible wrongs inflicted by all the colonizers, everyone who travelled here on the big, wooden ships. It is still HURTFUL and TRAGIC. 46 Chapter 7 The Last Three Stages of Life The first Four Stages of Life are the most important because everything that is said and taught at this time has major impact on the rest of our lives. In this final chapter, my presentation is within the Ojibwe Anishinaabe Oral Tradition. The magnitude of these Teachings would take an extended period of time that is beyond the scope of this paper. It would take another long period of time to include everything else that happened in my 78 years of life. I have included the rest of my Life Lodge Diagrams to give a visual/idea of the extent of the Teachings within the Ojibwe Life Lodge below: Figure 9: Seven Stages of Life Lodge, Jacque Lavallee (2021) Planning/Planting Life Stage 5: Ages 28-34 It is at this time that we concentrate on our families, our household, parents, aunties, sisters, brothers, and all the old ones who contribute to our future. We take on the responsibilities of our families, our homes, and our communities. We use all our Traditional Knowledge in every aspect of our lives. Maintaining and upholding our Spirituality through Ceremony which includes sending up Smoke every day, holding our Asemaa (Sacred Tobacco) in our hands, expressing our 47 Thanksgiving daily, and holding up the Water and the Berries. In simple Ceremony at home, we don't do the Water or the Berries. We just smudge, hold the Asemaa (Sacred Tobacco) in our hands, and pray. This is a good time to practice our Ojibwemowin (our Sacred Sound). In my drawing of the 'Fifth Stage' or 'Planning/Planting Life', there is a figure of a man pulling a woman into the future. He is pulling her so fast into the future (family life) that she loses her skirt. This is the speed of her relationships coming together as one and planning a family. My son Aaron was born into this stage of my life. I was yea so In this 'Stage of Life' you give over all your Traditional Knowledge and Teachings to your children and community. Showing off all that you have learned. Sing the praises of your children. Be very proud of your accomplishments and say so. Then you have arrived at Stage 7: Elder Good Life. In my drawing of the Sixth Stage, 'Doing/Teaching Life', there is a man, a woman, and two small children. They are a family. They live the Good Life because they are all holding hands. 48 Figure 11: 'Doing/Teaching Life', Jacque Lavallee (2021) Good Elder Life Stage 7: Ages 42 \u00e0 On into the Future This is where you get to look behind at past experiences for assurance. You look ahead for support. You notice there is no one behind you to assure you. There is no one in front of you to support you. YOU ARE ALONE! The work that you are doing now is to support your children, your family, your home, and your community. Keep smiling! You are the Elder! When you are an Elder, you become your Grandson's responsibility. He will take care of you unto death. In my drawing of the Seventh Stage, Elder Good Life, we see an old man bent over leaning on a cane, standing in front of the Western Doorway, the Doorway to the Star World. The right side of the page represents 'New Life' coming from Spirit World. The left side of the page represents 'Old Life' moving into Star World in 'passing An Anishinaabe 'Bibliography' Ojibwe Traditional Indigenous Knowledge is given orally and through direct participation in Ceremony beginning in childhood and continuing through adulthood. There is no written instruction anywhere on how to perform Ceremony. It is learned through observation and listening. Academia insists that as we sit and listen and watch that we also interfere in this learning procedure by insisting that we write down all the words that were said in the class. There is no room on that flat piece of paper with 'chicken scratches' for Anishinaabenhs (young Humans) to be able to fully experience the wholistic learning that is essential to Ojibwe Traditional Indigenous Knowledge. Anishinaabeg have always understood that complete learning requires one-hundred-percent attention through listening and observation. When writing is interjected into learning, it splits our consciousness/attention in two. There is no way to learn Ojibwe Traditional Indigenous Knowledge from a book. Books are written by other people who may or may not have lived the same teachings and/or ideology. Books contain other people's ideologies. I have read many, many books by some really beautiful Indigenous authors. I must say I really enjoyed them, but the books served only as a means of validation. Validating the Ojibwe Traditional Indigenous Knowledge that I had already learned and use today in my teaching profession. We cannot learn from a book. We need to have real, live teachers. These teachers are first the women within our own families and then throughout your Traditional Learning Process you are taken to other reserves to listen, watch, and only participate when asked. As beginners/learners we are charged to observe and listen. We learn at every Ceremony the order/methodology of performance (doing and helping). Apprenticeship begins in your own family. The women are our teachers and instructors. I was only seven years old when the Old People took an interest in me. I never questioned why this was so. I was just seven years old, brand new to our family ways. My Mamaa would wake Veronica and myself in the middle of the night to attend Ceremony. During Ceremony, I always sat between my Mamaa and my Auntie Aawis (Alice). In addition to my Mamaa, Agnes Lavallee (nee. Bimadjiwan) and my Auntie Aawis (Alice) Pawis (nee. Bimadjiwan), these are the Ojibwe Traditional Indigenous Knowledge Keepers from 51 Shawanaga First Nation that I apprenticed: Eliza Slagel (nee. Bimadjiwan), Ida Dumont (nee. Bimadjiwan), Gracie Atkins (nee. Bimadjiwan), Katie Joseph (nee. Bimadjiwan), Cicilia Edward Eagle, Harry Misquadis, Magwiss Pawis, Tom Bobiwash, Edward Johnson, John Jones, Henry Abitong, and Solomon Pawis. I also apprenticed with these Ojibwe Traditional Indigenous Knowledge Keepers from Jones, Edna and Magic Akiewenzie. From Mantoulin Island, I apprenticed with Kitty Bell, Leland Bell, and Edna Manitowabi. Some of these Ojibwe Traditional Indigenous Knowledge Keepers are Waabanowin (Dawn Society), some are Midewiwin (Three Fires Grand Medicine Lodge), others are the Old High Ojibwe, and some are Christian. At the Midewiwin (Three Fires Grand Medicine Lodge) I also apprenticed under Eddie Benton-Banai, Jim Dumont, Charlie Nelson, Rodger Jones, Porky White, Peter O'Chiese, Josephine Mandaamin, Lena Kidd, Vera Martin, Lilly Bourgoise, Betty Pamp (Bodweaotome). Most of these people are already in Spirit World. I was never instructed on how to give over the Ojibwe Traditional Indigenous Knowledge that was given to me by these Teachers. I am ethically responsible for ensuring that the Ojibwe Traditional Indigenous Knowledge that I share has only been learned through the Ojibwe Oral Tradition and that I would never write down these teachings in their fullness. This why everything that I have shared here has been done through my own personal story based on the Ojibwe Traditional Indigenous Knowledge that was given. Published Works Cited Densmore, F. (1970).
