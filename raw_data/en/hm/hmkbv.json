Fibrocystic breasts aren't harmful or dangerous, but may be bothersome or uncomfortable for some women. According to the Mayo Clinic, more than half of women will develop fibrocystic breast disease at some point in their lives. Many women with fibrocystic breasts will not have any associated symptoms. Although it isn't harmful to have fibrocystic breasts, this condition can make the detection of breast cancer more challenging. CAUSES According to the Medical Profession, the specific cause of fibrocystic breast disease isn't fully understood. Your breast tissue changes in response to the hormones made by the ovaries. If you have fibrocystic breasts, you may have more pronounced changes in response to these hormones. This can result in swelling and tender or painful breast lumps. Symptoms are most common just before or during your period. In addition to lumps in your breasts caused by cysts and swelling of your breast lobules, the milk-producing glands, you may also feel a lumpy thickening in your breast caused by an excess growth of fibrous tissue. RISKS Any woman can get fibrocystic breast disease, but it most commonly occurs in women in their 30s to 50s. Birth control pills may reduce your symptoms, and hormone therapy may increase them. Symptoms typically improve or resolve after menopause. CANCER Fibrocystic breast disease doesn't increase your risk of getting cancer, but the changes in your breasts can make it more difficult for you or your doctor to identify potentially cancerous lumps during breast exams and on mammograms. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that women between 50 and 74 years old get a mammogram every two years. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) also notes that regular breast self-exams can be helpful. It's important that you become familiar with how your breasts look and feel normally so that you'll know when there are changes or something doesn't seem right. If you have fibrocystic breast disease, you may experience the following symptoms: You may have more swelling or lumps in one breast than the other. Your symptoms will probably be worse right before your period due to hormonal changes, but you may have symptoms throughout the month. The lumps in fibrocystic breasts tend to fluctuate in size throughout the month and are usually movable. But sometimes if there's a lot of fibrous tissue, the lumps may be more fixed in one place. You may also experience pain under your arms. Some women have a green or dark brown discharge from their nipples. See your doctor immediately if clear, red, or bloody fluid comes out of your nipple, as this may be a sign of breast cancer. DIAGNOSIS How is Fibrocystic Breast Disease Diagnosed? Your doctor can diagnose fibrocystic breast disease by doing a physical breast exam. Your doctor may also order a mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI to get a better look at the changes in your breasts. John Hopkins recommends a digital mammogram for women with fibrocystic breasts, as this technology allows for more accurate breast imaging. In some cases, ultrasound may help distinguish normal breast tissue from abnormalities. If your doctor is concerned about the appearance of a cyst or other finding in your breast, they may order a biopsy to see if it's cancerous. This biopsy is usually performed by fine needle aspiration, a surgical procedure to remove the fluid or tissue using a small needle. The challenge with doing a breast biopsy is the chance of \"letting the Genie out of the bottle.\" Anything that is encapsulated and walled off from the rest of the body, by piercing it with a needle, will now create the basis for any potential cancer to now have a way out of the previously walled off and encapsulated cyst. Breast Thermogram To avoid this and other complications by irradiating the breast with a mammogram, potentially creating the basis for cancer, we recommend having a Breast Thermogram. Since there is no radiation involved, this will greatly decrease the radiation exposure associated with mammograms, especially if you are recommended to have one every year. The accumulation of radiation over time is important to consider when choosing to nurture yourself and protect yourself from developing breast cancer. TREATMENTS How is Fibrocystic Breast Disease Treated? Most women who have fibrocystic breast disease don't require invasive treatment. Home treatment is usually sufficient to relieve associated pain and discomfort. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) can usually effectively relieve any pain and discomfort. Becoming dependent on these type of pain-relievers will create other health complications related to liver health and create the basis for an inflamed liver and arthritis over time. You can also try wearing a well-fitting, supportive bra to reduce breast pain and tenderness. Some women find that applying warm or cold compresses relieves their symptoms. Try applying a warm cloth or ice wrapped in a cloth to your breasts to see which works best for you. Advice from a Medical Expert Dr. Huntoon has worked with many women who have presented with the diagnosis of Fibrocystic Breast Disease. Continue reading below to understand what can be done to address the CAUSE of this very common, but not normal, health concern. ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS The advice given from a Medical Expert seems alarming. Stating that Fibrocystic breast changes are considered \"normal\" seems problematic. Normal is not the same as common. Just because women experience this as a common response to wearing bras with underwires, use many different xenobiotics in their daily habits, while the FDA has no regulation of these substances, makes it a common problem. This is anything but normal and why we offer the following recommendations as a natural way to avoid Fibrocystic Breast Disease. We do not recommend wearing bras that use underwires Plastic or metal underwires will cut off the energy flow within the breast tissue and the body, causing energy stagnation and potential of cellular change over time. When in doubt, take your bra off and allow the breast tissue to support itself. This is best over time for the health of the breast tissue. Specific application of Shea Butter infused with the Essential Oils of Frankincense and Myrrh to the breasts will help to create normal breast tissue, as this formula has demonstrated a return to normal healthy breast tissue over time. The application, done daily as a health regime, is recommended. Dietary Changes [Iodine deficiency](iodinedeficiency-anepidemic.asp) and using iodine supplementation under the direction of your [Holistic Chiropractor](holistic-chiropractor.asp) helps eliminate the development of fibrocystic disease in any part of the body. Specific to helping the thyroid, iodine receptors are located in every tissue within the body (breasts, heart, liver, lung, adrenals, kidneys, ovaries, uterus, muscles and intestines). When proper iodine levels are achieved, the fibrocystic disease seems to magically disappear. Some people have found that limiting their caffeine intake, eating a low-fat diet, or taking essential fatty acid supplements will reduce the symptoms of fibrocystic breast disease. However, there are no randomized controlled studies that show that these or any dietary changes are effective at relieving symptoms. Working with a [Holistic Chiropractor](holistic-chiropractor.asp) that understands how to do this for their patient becomes vital for resolution of this serious concern. Others have benefited by using Acupuncture, Homeopathy and Naturopathy. WHEN TO CALL YOUR DOCTOR When you should call your doctor Call your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms.

Long-term Outlook According to the Medical Profession, the specific cause of fibrocystic breast disease isn't fully understood. However, doctors suspect that estrogen and other reproductive hormones play a role. As a result, your symptoms will likely disappear once you reach menopause, as the fluctuation and production of these hormones decreases and stabilizes.
