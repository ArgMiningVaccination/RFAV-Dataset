During the 2018-2019 school year, 3.8% of kindergartners were exempt from every required vaccine compared to 2.9% of 6th grade students. Child Care Kindergarten 6th Grade Data Source: Arizona Immunization Statistics Reports, 2016-2019SignificanceState and local vaccination requirements for daycare and school entry are important tools for maintaining high vaccination coverage rates, and in turn, lower rates of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Vaccination requirements that reach more children through a broad range of facilities, that have more requirements for receiving an exemption, that require parental documentation of exemption requests, and that are implemented with strong enforcement and monitoring may help promote higher rates of vaccination coverage, and in turn, lower rates of VPDs. Ongoing provider outreach and public education about vaccines and the diseases they prevent may also lead to such an increase. Data Source: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/laws/state-reqs.html Personal Exemptions Personal exemption rates have been increasing for child care, kindergarten, and 6th grade students over the past three school years. During the 2018-2019 school year, 6.1% of 6th grade students received a personal exemption, followed by 5.9% of kindergartners and 4.5% of children in child care. Medical Exemptions There was an increase in medical exemptions during the 2016- 2017 school year for child care, kindergarten, and 6th grade students. However, during the 2017-2018 school year the percentage of students in each of those groups filing a medical exemption declined during the 2018-2019 school year. During the 2018-2019 school year, 0.3% child care and kindergarten students received a medical exemption whereas 0.2% of 6th grade students received a medical exemption.
