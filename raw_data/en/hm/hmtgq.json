Benefits of Herbal Medicine Herbal medicine extends your treatment into your home by bottling Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) benefits. Our board-certified herbalists will diagnose your unique TCM pattern(s) and create a Chinese herbal formula that is unique to you and your needs.

We work to treat both your constitution\u2014or root issues\u2014as well as the symptoms you're experiencing\u2014or branch concerns. You can think of herbal medicine as the internal medicine branch of TCM. The health benefits of herbal medicine include improved digestion, better sleep quality, improved mood, easier periods and relief from PMS symptoms, fewer night sweats and hot flashes, more energy, relief from acid reflux, and many more! We're very proud to have also helped some patients step down their medication dose (with support from their doctors) or get off certain medications completely with herbal medicine. Chinese herbal medicine can effectively treat multiple symptoms with one formula. Chinese Herbal Medicine Chinese herbal medicine is a sophisticated medical system with highly individualized diagnoses and treatment. [Our acupuncturists](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/team/acupuncturist) are not taking guesses as to what might work for you but are prescribing herbs based on observable patterns in your body. It's an elegant system that takes seemingly disconnected symptoms, brings them together into a single diagnosis, and treats them with a single formula. Formulas typically use 5-15 herbs. Some of these are chief herbs (treat the main symptoms), while some are guide herbs (telling the herbs where to go in the body), and some are assistant herbs (increase the effectiveness of the chief herbs). The guiding principle of Chinese herbal treatments is \"treat by opposite,\" where formulas balance symptoms. For instance, too much heat is treated with cooling herbs. The result is a highly specific treatment that deals with your unique case and works more effectively on your health concerns. Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine Healthcare [Acupuncture](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/services/acupuncture) and herbal medicine go hand in hand. Just as acupuncture is used to balance and restore, so does Chinese herbal medicine. However, adding herbs to your [acupuncture treatment](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/services/acupuncture) helps extend your treatment's benefits throughout the week. This helps to speed recovery and resolve symptoms faster than with acupuncture alone. These two work synergistically\u2014each enhances the other's positive effects on your symptoms. Herbal medicine extends the benefits of acupuncture through the week and helps to resolve symptoms faster. Herbal Medicine & Nutrition Herbal medicine and [nutrition](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/services/nutrition-wellness-planning) share healing characteristics in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Depending on your symptoms and constitution, [our acupuncturists](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/team/acupuncturist) may prescribe herbal medicine and nutrition recommendations that have similar effects, such as warming herbs and food, to counter a cold illness. These two work synergistically to heal you and resolve your symptoms, providing faster relief and better long-term results than either alone.

We Include Herbal Medicine to Amplify and Extend the Benefits of Your Acupuncture Treatment What We Treat Chinese herbal medicine amplifies and extends the benefits of [acupuncture](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/services/acupuncture), helping to resolve your symptoms faster. Our treatments fall into five main categories. Chronic and Acute Pain Mental Health Fertility and Perinatal Care Women's Health Internal Medicine Symptoms We Treat With Herbal Medicine Chinese herbal medicine can help heal a wide variety of symptoms, including: Stress In Washington, DC, most people are under quite a bit of [stress](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/mental-health/acupuncture-and-herbs-for-stress-relief). At Cherry Blossom Healing Arts, we are experts in helping you handle stress. [Our acupuncturists](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/team/acupuncturist) can't eliminate your stressors, but they can help you handle them. We work with many Chinese herbs that are adaptogens and help the body handle stress on a cellular level. Insomnia Whether the [issue is falling asleep or staying asleep](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/we-treat/insomnia), herbal medicine can help with herbs like suan zao ren, which calms the spirit, prevents night sweats, and lowers blood pressure. We don't sedate you\u2014our herbs don't knock you out. Rather, they treat the root problem that prevents you from falling asleep. That means you will eventually be able to fall asleep without our herbs. Our herbal medicine regimes don't need to be taken indefinitely and won't be habit forming. Women's Health You don't have to have a heavy or painful period, and you can get through a period without taking pain medication. Chinese herbal medicine for women's health can help regulate all these symptoms and make that time of the month far less stressful and all-consuming. Your period is a monthly report card for women's health\u2014if it is problematic, the issues will stretch beyond just your period. Our herbalists can treat menstrual pain, dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, PMS, urinary problems, and bladder problems. For instance, hong hua is a warm and spicy herb that regulates the blood. It is analgesic, anti-coagulant, anti-inflammatory, and a uterine stimulant. GI Conditions Who doesn't have a little heartburn and constipation with the pandemic raging? Chinese herbal medicine for heartburn can soothe, and Chinese herbal medicine for constipation can help keep things moving. Huang lian is a bitter herb that treats heat (too much acid = heat), and sore throat, reflux, or other problems in the GI tract, such as diarrhea. It contains berberine, which helps with hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Herbal formulas can help soothe and repair the digestive tract, including the esophagus. In formulas of multiple herbs, we can aid digestion, help with constipation, and treat heartburn. We've got the whole GI tract covered, from your mouth to your colon. Seasonal Allergies Don't dread your spring and fall [seasonal allergies](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/we-treat/allergies)! Chinese herbal medicine for [allergies](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/we-treat/allergies) can open your nasal cavity and boost your immune system to help protect against future allergic attacks. Our herbalists utilize herbs like cang er zi, which helps clear a stuffy nose with thick mucus and also treats sinus [headaches](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/we-treat/headaches). It is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory\u2014and often paired with other herbs that help prevent future allergic attacks. Migraines [Migraines](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/we-treat/migraines) are deadly to productivity. They have an infuriating way of arriving right when life has turned into a train wreck. Work is stressing you out, and because of that [stress](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/mental-health/acupuncture-and-herbs-for-stress-relief), you haven't been eating well or skipping meals, and then your boss yells at you for something that maybe was your fault, and then your child gets sick and...migraine, and lights out on taking care of any of these other problems. Chinese herbal medicine for [migraine headaches](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/we-treat/migraines) takes a comprehensive approach to the sources of migraines. They're a complex medical phenomena that usually result from multiple causes. The root problem is often a deficiency, or what some call being \"wired and tired.\" Our herbal formulas deeply nourish and help people rest well, which reduces the deficiency and helps prevent the physiological problem that triggers migraines. We'll often use chuan xiong which specifically treats pain in the head. Our herbs can reduce the amount and severity of migraines by treating the multiple patterns associated with stress, sleep, and nutrition that usually lie at the root of migraines. Anxiety Herbal medicine for anxiety can help you focus, relieve palpitations, eliminate [insomnia](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/we-treat/insomnia), and give you a sense of calm. Wu wei zi, for instance, is a vasodilator and adaptogen, which promotes blood flow and can lower blood pressure. We are adept at working with patients taking a few medications and can even prescribe herbal medicine for patients who are on an SSRI. Depression There has long been Chinese herbal medicine for depression. A classic Chinese medicine herb is he huan pi, which literally translates to \"everybody happy bark!\" Chinese herbal medicine can help improve your mood and works especially well to treat symptoms related to depression, such as [insomnia](https://www.cherryblossomhealingarts.com/we-treat/insomnia) and other sleep disorders. Chinese herbal medicine also supports traditional mental health care and your work with a therapist or your SSRI or other medication. Pain Chinese herbal medicine for pain offers targeted pain treatment through guide herbs. These herbs have a special place in Chinese herbal medicine, as they guide a more complex formula to a specific location in the body. Ji xue teng, for example, guides herbal formulas to target the legs, feet, and hands, and thus is especially helpful at reducing pain in those parts of the body. Inflammation Chinese herbal medicine for inflammation uses \"blood movers,\" which help the body get resources for healing to an area of inflammation. The classic herb is yu jin, which contains curcumin, is anti-inflammatory, and inhibits inflammatory cytokines (small proteins that cells use to communicate with each other). Inflammation almost never occurs by itself but is accompanied by unwelcome companions like acute pain. Herbal formulas for inflammation can treat these related symptoms with additional herbs to treat arthritis, acute pain, or postoperative pain.
