A service that has been commissioned based on the principles of co-production is more likely to be cost-effective, responsive and have high satisfaction and health outcome rates from people using it. Here are the evidence and tools to enable co-production in mental health commissioning. Introduction Background Recommendation 8 of The Five Year Forward View for Mental Health called for the development of evidence-based approaches to co-production in commissioning: \"NHS England should work with NHS Improvement to run pilots to develop evidence-based approaches to co-production in commissioning.\" The NHS Long Term Plan also encourages collaboration between people, primary care and community services and commissioners, clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), and between services and trusts. The NHS Long Term Plan's pledge to 'do more to develop and embed cultures of compassion, inclusion and collaboration across the NHS' means that co-production in mental health care commissioning is vital and achievable. Purpose and scope of the resource By setting out the evidence, including examples of positive practice, this document aims to improve local strategic decisions about, and the provision of, current and future mental health services for children, young people, adults and older adults. This document also talks about co-production with people who are at risk of developing mental health problems, including those who have an increased risk of being detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 (amended 2007 and by the Policing and Crime Act 2017) and people who may face discrimination because of their protected characteristics (see [Section 1.5 of the document](http://rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/improving-care/nccmh/working-well-together/working-well-together-evidence-and-tools-to-enable-coproduction-in-mental-health-commissioning.pdf) for more information on protected characteristics and inequalities). The recommendations from this document are aimed at commissioners of mental health services, as well as people who need mental health services, their families, friends and carers, and those who work in mental health care and support. Co-production defined Co-production is an ongoing partnership between people who design, deliver and commission services, people who use the services and people who need them.

Benefits of co-production There is strong evidence to support that taking part in co-production, as well as being part of a community of peers, is a positive experience both for people with experience of mental health problems and those involved in mental health commissioning and provision. Co-production contributes to a sense of shared identity and purpose among all involved. Benefits for people involved in co-production: - confidence to develop new peer relationships - development and enhancement of skills and employability - empowered professionals in front-line practice who are confident in positive risk-taking and have more empathy - improved confidence and self-esteem - improvement in own individual health and wellbeing - improved recognition of working group members' expertise, leading to an exchange of skills - improved relationships, understanding and power balance between people who use the service and service providers - increased social connectedness and new peer relationships "}
