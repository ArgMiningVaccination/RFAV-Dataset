There is no perfect treatment, but we hope you'll explore some of these options. PLEASE NOTE: We encourage everyone to talk with a medical professional before undergoing a new treatment. About the BrainLine Treatment Hub [In collaboration with experts on brain injury and PTSD](https://www.brainline.org/treatment/treatment-hub-expert-consultants), we have gathered a list of possible treatments to consider. Some have strong evidence of effectiveness with peer-reviewed studies and have been in use for a long time. Others are newer and may have only anecdotal evidence to support their effectiveness. We're including this wide range of treatments because we know many people are searching for answers, and we're trying to provide a clear overview about what's known and what isn't known about each treatment, and where you can go to find help. The treatments we highlight are widely discussed, and either currently available or might be available in the near future. Sometimes even if a treatment seems right for you, it can be hard to know where to find it or what questions to ask. We hope to make that process a little easier. Here are some things to keep in mind as you explore: - Coordinating treatments with your doctor or health care provider is critical. - Every brain is different. Treatments that work for some may not work as well for you. - You might use more than one treatment at a time. - It may take time to see improvements. Be persistent and patient. We are very grateful for the expert help we've received. We will be expanding and upgrading the Treatment Hub as needed. We'd welcome your questions or comments about the Treatment Hub, feedback about your own experiences, and suggestions about how we can improve.
