Samples were collected at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 26 24 and 48. Interferon (IFN)-, IL-2, IL-4 and perforin ELISpot assays performed at each time point 27 quantified functional responses to Gag p17/p24, Nef, Rev, and Tat peptides; and detailed T-cell 28 immunophenotyping was undertaken by flow cytometry. Proviral DNA was also measured. 29 Results: Median baseline T-cell count was 757 cells/mm3 (interquartile cells/mm3), median 42-51 years), and plasma HIV-1-RNA <50 copies/ml for all subjects. 31 Patients who received vaccine plus IL-2, GM-CSF and rhGH (group 1) showed the most marked changes. 32 Assessing mean changes from baseline to week 48 revealed significantly elevated numbers of CD4 T cells 33 (p=0.0083) and improved CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios (p=0.0033). This was accompanied by a significant 34 reduction in expression of CD38 on CD4 T cells (p=0.0194), significantly increased IFN- and IL-2 35 production in response to Gag (p=0.0122) and elevated IFN- production in response to Tat (p=0.041) at 36 week 48 compared to baseline. Subjects in all treatment groups showed significantly reduced PD-1 37 expression at week 48 compared to baseline, with some reductions in proviral DNA. 38 Conclusions: Multifarious immunotherapeutic approaches in the context of fully suppressive cART further 39 reduce immune activation, and improve both CD4 T-lymphocyte counts and HIV-1-specific T-cell 40 responses. (NCT01130376) 41 42 Page 3 of 19 1. Introduction 43 Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) improves morbidity and mortality in infected patients [1]; 44 however, it cannot eradicate HIV-1 and does not enable the immune system to control HIV-1 replication [2, 45 3]. Viral reservoirs persist and viral rebound is seen following treatment interruption [4-7]. Immunotherapy 46 in chronic, treated HIV-1 infection has the potential to reduce viral reservoirs by reversing T-cell dysfunction 47 and modifying immune responses to mirror those found in long-term nonprogressors or HIV controllers [3, 48 8, 9]. Ideal immunotherapeutic approaches would induce and maintain HIV-1-specific responses, increase 49 polyfunctionality, enhance thymic function, reduce levels of immune activation and reverse T-cell 50 anergy/exhaustion. The benefits of immunotherapy on clinical outcomes may include: more sustained viral 51 control; suppression of residual viraemia; prevention of reservoir re-seeding; eradication of the reservoir 52 [10]; and reduced risk of both HIV-1-related and inflammation-related morbidity and mortality. 53 54 Design of this clinical trial, immunomodulatory agents used, and timing of their administration were 55 developed from previous studies [3, 9]. Immunisation in conjunction with cART may lead to a reversal of 56 anergy by selective induction and activation of specific memory responses against viral proteins [3, 11]. 57 Although the efficacy of interleukin (IL)-2 administration in HIV-1+ subjects has been challenged, it has 58 been shown to increase CD4 T-cell counts [12]. In animal models relevant responses were preserved and 59 maintained when IL-2 was administered during the antigen-specific T-cell contraction phase of the immune 60 response [13, 14]. In contrast, IL-2 given pre-immunisation in HIV-1+ cART-treated failed to 61 increase specific T-cell proliferation [15, 16], although IL-2 administered following tetanus immunisation in 62 HIV-1-infected persons was found to better sustain tetanus-specific responses than IL-2 given together with 63 vaccine or before immunisation [17]. Here we describe administration of IL-2 following immunisation as 64 part of an immunotherapeutic programme also including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 65 (GM-CSF) and recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). In the context of HIV-1 infection, GM-CSF 66 has been reported to increase CD4 T-cell counts and reduce plasma HIV-1 RNA [18]. GM-CSF activates 67 antigen presenting cells, and and proliferation [19, 20]. IL-2 and GM-68 have shown efficacy as adjuvants for DNA- or peptide-based vaccines [21]. In 1996, the United States 69 FDA approved rhGH to treat HIV-1 associated wasting (although it is not approved for use in the European 70 Union or Switzerland), with demonstrable improvements in a number of factors including quality of life [22]. 71 Page 4 of 19 Immunological benefits of rhGH include: reversal of thymic involution [23-26]; in total naive 72 CD4 T-cell counts [23, 24, 26, 27]; restoration of T-cell responses against HIV-1 [27-29]; and reduction in 73 expression of activation (CD38, HLA-DR) and apoptosis (CD95) markers [24]. 74 75 In this study, immunisation was used to prime specific cellular responses within treated-HIV-1-infected 76 individuals followed by the administration of a regime of cytokines/rhGH along with further vaccine boosts 77 designed to augment and sustain memory responses to HIV-1 [3], which in turn were postulated to confer 78 clinical benefit. 79 2. Materials and methods 80 2.1. Study design 81 This randomised, open label, phase I, immunotherapeutic study (NCT01130376) was conducted in 82 compliance with GCP guidelines and approved by appropriate review boards and ethics committees. All 83 study participants provided written informed consent prior to study entry and were considered eligible if they 84 were chronically infected with HIV-1, on stable cART, with plasma viral load <50 copies/ml, and CD4 T-85 cell count >400 cells/mm3. It was intended to recruit and screen 50 patients, of which 30 were to be 86 randomised into the study (with subjects randomised equally into each arm). The sample size was 87 determined accounting for an estimated 10% drop out by week 48, and we calculated an 80% power to show 88 significant changes (p=0.05) if we recruited 10 patients into each arm. Patients were randomised into one of 89 three arms with treatment schedules as shown in Fig. 1. The primary endpoint of the study was analysis of 90 safety and toxicity data in relation to grade 3 or above laboratory or clinical serious adverse events (SAE), 91 which could be attributed to the treatments given. Lymphocyte subsets and plasma viral load were 92 determined at each time point as previously described [30]. 93 2.2. Vaccine 94 GTU\u00ae-MultiHIV DNA Clade B vaccine (Han-2 isolate) is comprised of both regulatory and structural HIV-95 1 proteins (Rev, Nef, Tat, p17, p24, and stretch of eleven cytotoxic T-lymphocyte [CTL] epitope clusters 96 from Pol and Env) representing B clade, cloned into a vector termed the Gene Transport Unit (GTU\u00ae). 97 GTU\u00ae also codes for a nuclear anchoring protein (bovine papilloma virus E2) [31, 32]. The vaccine has 98 been found to be safe and well-tolerated in phase I and II clinical trials [11, 31]. 99 Page 5 of 19 2.3. HIV-1 peptides 100 HIV-1 peptides were sourced from NIBSC (Potters 15mers overlapping by 5, and 20mers overlapping by 10, and used at a 104 final concentration of 5\u00b5g/ml. A second set of peptides run in parallel were from FIT Biotech (Tartu, 105 Estonia; kindly provided by Rein Sikut): Gag p17/p24, Rev, Tat, Nef, and CTL epitope-stretch peptides 106 (15mers with an 11 amino acid overlap) for the MultiHIV-B consensus antigen [33], which were used at a 107 final concentration of 2\u00b5g/ml. 108 2.4. HIV-1-specific T-cell responses 109 IFN-, IL-2, IL-4, and perforin production in response to HIV-1 peptide pools was investigated using 110 enzyme-linked immune spot (ELISpot) assays at each time point. Briefly, 2.5x105 peripheral blood 111 mononuclear cells (PBMC) were added per well in duplicate and stimulated with peptides (described in 112 section 2.3) or positive/negative controls, and processed as previously described [34]. IFN-, IL-2 and IL-4 113 responses were positive if >50 spot forming cells (SFC) were present per million PBMC after background 114 (negative control) was subtracted and if this number was at least twice the background. Perforin assay cut-off 115 was >100 SFC (due to higher background). 116 2.5. T-cell phenotyping 117 Flow cytometry was carried out BD LSR II Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, were labelled murine anti-human monoclonal (Miltenyi Biotech Ltd, Bisley, UK). Following acquisition, forward and side 124 scatter properties were used to determine the lymphocyte population and 50,000 gated lymphocyte events 125 were collected for each sample. Appropriate isotype-matched control mAbs were run in parallel for each 126 sample, and data analysis was performed using FACSDiva Software version 6.1.2 (BD Biosciences, San 127 Jose, CA). 128 Page 6 of 19 2.6. DNA extraction and proviral DNA 129 DNA was isolated from cryopreserved baseline (week 0) and week 48 PBMC samples using the Nucleon 130 BACC2 Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Gen-Probe Life Sciences Ltd, Manchester, UK) as per 131 manufacturer's instructions. Proviral DNA was quantified using the COBAS\u00ae Taqman\u00ae HIV-1 Test, 132 version 2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc, Branchburg, NJ) and copies/\u00b5g cellular DNA calculated. 133 2.7. Sequencing 134 Patient HIV-1 subtypes were determined at FIT Biotech Ltd (Tartu, Estonia). Two proviral DNA regions 135 were sequenced and genotyped from cryopreserved PBMC (5x106), as described previously in detail [35]. 136 2.8. Statistical analysis 137 All summary statistics of quantitative data are presented as median with interquartile range (IQR). 138 Qualitative data are presented as numbers and percentages. Since longitudinally collected data were available 139 at study visit time points, linear mixed model was used for between treatment arm comparisons to calculate 140 the difference in averages which represent the time weighted difference in immunological (functional and 141 phenotypic) results from baseline to each study time points. A random intercept model using MIXED 142 procedure in SAS was generated by fitting all clinical and immunological results as dependent variables by 143 study time points, stratified by the three randomised treatment arms. Mean changes from baseline to each of 144 the study time points in all clinical and immunological parameters are given as point estimates, presented 145 with a 95% confidence interval (CI). For the graphs presented herein, where the 95% CI does not cross the 146 line of origin, a statistically significant difference can be inferred (above, a statistically significant increase 147 from baseline, and below, a statistically significant decrease from baseline). Where the 95% CI from the 148 groups do not overlap for an individual time point, there is a statistically significant difference between the 149 means of the groups. The small numbers in each treatment arm were taken into consideration and descriptive 150 statistics were also carried out. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (Institute Inc, 151 Cary, NC) statistical software; all p-values presented are two-tailed and a statistically significant change 152 from baseline to each of the study time points are indicated with asterisks (*) in figures. 153 Page 7 of 19 3. Results 154 3.1. Baseline patient characteristics 155 Of ninety-three patient referrals, twelve patients met the eligibility criteria for enrolment (baseline patient 156 characteristics and randomisation group allocation as per Table 1) and were randomised into one of three 157 arms of the trial, with the treatment schedule as per Fig. 1. There were no statistically significant differences 158 determined, using the Kruskal-Wallis test, in the clinical characteristics presented in Table 1 between the 159 three arms of the study at baseline, in terms of: age (p=0.621); baseline since HIV-1 (p=0.914); duration of cART (p=0.536); and 161 CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio (0.070). 162 3.2. Lymphocyte subsets and HIV-1 RNA 163 Administration of IL-2 and GM-CSF for five days resulted in mean change in CD4 counts of 1307 cells/mm3 164 and 1511 cells/mm3 in groups 1 and 3 (p <0.0001 for both), at week 2 compared to baseline. This was 165 significantly higher than for group 2 (in which patients received vaccine alone; Fig. 2A). At week 6, CD4 166 counts remained elevated compared to baseline in both groups that received cytokines and rhGH, and the 167 mean increase was 413 cells/mm3 and 239 cells/mm3 in groups 1 and 3 (p=0.0001 and p=0.0039, 168 respectively), whereas for group 2 there was a marginal but statistically significant decrease in the mean CD4 169 count at week 6 compared to baseline of -191 cells/mm3 (p=0.0369). At the final study time point, week 48, 170 only patients from group 1 (who received immunisation plus cytokines and rhGH) demonstrated a sustained 171 increase in mean CD4 count compared to baseline of 281 cells/mm3 (p=0.0083; Fig. 2A). Mean changes 172 from baseline, 95% CI and p values for parameters presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3 are summarised in 173 Supplementary Table 1. 174 175 Throughout the course of 48 weeks, CD8 counts followed a similar pattern to CD4 counts. Patients in groups 176 1 and 3 demonstrated statistically significant increases in their CD8 counts at week 2, following 177 administration of IL-2 and GM-CSF, compared to baseline and compared to group 2. Mean increases from 178 baseline at week 2 were 634 cells/mm3 and 999 cells/mm3 (p <0.0001 for both; Fig. 2B). The increase was 179 more prominent for group 3 for which CD8 counts remained elevated at weeks 4 and 6, with mean increases 180 from baseline of 248 cells/mm3 and 220 cells/mm3 (p=0.0168 and p=0.0330, respectively). Patients in group 181 Page 8 of 19 2 experienced a marginal but significant reduction in the numbers of CD8 T cells at weeks 6 and 12 with a 182 mean decreases of -283 cells/mm3 and -239 cells/mm3 (p=0.0151 and p=0.0387, respectively). By week 48, 183 there was no difference from baseline in CD8 counts for any of the groups (Fig. 2B). 184 185 CD4/CD8 ratios were elevated at week 2 for individuals in groups 1 and 3 with mean increases from baseline 186 of 0.43 and 0.34 (p <0.0001 for both). This increased CD4/CD8 ratio was maintained for all other time 187 points for group 1 patients with mean increase from baseline to week 48 of 0.27 (p=0.0033; Fig. 2C). 188 189 Plasma viral load was <50 copies/ml for all individuals at screen visits, baseline and week 48. 190 3.3. T-cell function and phenotype 191 Patients in group 1 demonstrated noticeable increase in IFN- production in response to stimulation with Gag 192 p17/p24 peptides at week 4, although this did not reach statistical significance (mean increase 223 SFC/106 193 PBMC; p=0.071; Fig. 3A). This increase was maintained throughout the remaining study period and reached 194 significance at week 48 (mean increase 312 SFC/106 PBMC; p=0.0122; Fig. 3A). Similarly, IL-2 production 195 in response to Gag p17/p24 stimulation was significantly elevated at week 48 compared to baseline for these 196 subjects (mean increase 79 SFC/106 PBMC; p=0.0017; Fig. 3B). Subjects randomised to this group also 197 showed an elevated IFN- response to Tat peptides at week 48 (data not shown). 198 199 As expected, the percentage of T cells expressing the activation marker, CD38, was significantly increased at 200 week 2 in all study groups and was more pronounced for individuals who received IL-2 and GM-CSF (Fig. 201 3C and D). By week 4, CD38 expression on the CD4 T cells had normalised for patients in all study groups 202 and by week 6, there was a significant reduction in the percentage expression of CD38 on CD4 T cells for 203 individuals who received cytokine and rhGH that was maintained throughout the remainder of the study, 204 where the mean decrease from baseline was -8.3% (p=0.0194) and -6.1% (p=0.0254; Fig. 3C). At week 24, 205 individuals in groups 1 and 3 showed a significant reduction in the percentage expression of CD38 on their 206 CD8 T cells, and this was only maintained for individuals in group 3, with mean decrease from baseline to 207 week 48 of -8.8% (p=0.0139), although there was a trend towards a decrease in this marker for individuals in 208 group 1 with a mean decline from baseline of -8.4% (p=0.0651; Fig. 3D). The percentage of CD4 and CD8 T 209 cells expressing PD-1 was significantly reduced at week 48 for all treatment groups (Fig. 3E and F). CD4 T-210 Page 9 of 19 cell mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD95 was significantly reduced by week 48, despite significant 211 increases at week 2, and mean decreases from baseline were -1562 (p=0.0077) and -1675 (p=0.0003) for 212 groups 1 and 3 respectively (Fig. 3G). CD95 expression in terms of MFI followed the same pattern on the 213 CD8 T cells, with a significant increase at week 2 compared to baseline for individuals that received IL-2 214 and GM-CSF and a significant reduction by week 48 for patients in group 3, with trend towards reduction for 215 those in group 1 (Fig. 3H). 216 217 The most marked changes in T-cell function and phenotype at week 48 (compared to baseline) were seen for 218 individuals in group 1. Representative plots looking at changes on an individual level are shown in Fig. 4. 219 Subject G739 demonstrated reduced CD38 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells at week 48, which was 220 paralleled by increased IFN- response to Gag (Fig. 4A). For patient B784, CD8 T-cell activation was below 221 the baseline value at week 48 while expression of CD38 on CD4 T cells had returned to the baseline level for 222 this individual. At this time point, the subject demonstrated increased IFN- and IL-2 production in response 223 to Gag stimulation (Fig. 4B). Finally, as a comparison, subject C319 (in group 3) showed small fluctuations 224 in these parameters throughout the course of the study, and despite slightly elevated functional responses at 225 week 48, activation levels were unaltered compared to baseline (Fig. 4C). 226 3.4. Proviral DNA 227 In each treatment group, distinct patients demonstrated a decrease in proviral DNA at week 48 compared to 228 baseline, while others revealed an increase (Table 2). Statistical analyses comparing changes in proviral 229 DNA levels from baseline to week 48 between the treatment groups demonstrated no significant differences. 230 Patients G739 (group 1) and F810 (group 3) had the greatest reduction in proviral DNA at week 48 (with a 231 reduction of 1052 and 1527 copies/\u00b5g cellular DNA, respectively; Table 2). 232 3.5. Toxicology, adverse event monitoring and endpoints 233 No differences were observed in the plasma chemistry data in any of the groups, throughout the course of the 234 study confirming that the interventions were well-tolerated. The adverse events documented were mostly 235 mild and were usually limited to erythema at the injection site. Subject C241 (randomised to group 3) was 236 admitted with headache following one dose of rhGH. Due to the patient's SAE, it was agreed that this 237 subject should receive no further rhGH and continued on observational basis only. Data were re-analysed 238 Page 10 of 19 excluding all data captured post day 14 for this patient, which did not alter outcome of the findings (results 239 not presented). Overall, the treatments were determined to be safe and well-tolerated. 240 4. Discussion 241 This study demonstrates that a novel combination immunotherapy with an HIV-1 vaccine leads to enhanced 242 anti-HIV-1 responses and reversal of unfavourable immunophenotypes. The approach was well-tolerated, 243 and subjects who received immunisation, IL-2, GM-CSF and rhGH (group 1) showed the most marked 244 changes at final study time point compared to baseline. CD4 T-cell counts were significantly increased at 245 week 2 and remained elevated at the majority of time points, compared to baseline, after week 2. We propose 246 that this is an effect of the combination of cytokines and subsequent hormone administration, in addition to 247 vaccine, that is driving these immunological changes. Furthermore, CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios improved, and 248 these changes were accompanied by enhanced functional responses to Gag and a reversal of unfavourable 249 immunophenotypes. Sullivan et al., reported HIV-1-specific lymphoproliferative responses (particularly to 250 p24) at week 24 when IL-2 was administered during weeks 0, 4 and 8, and the response was relatively 251 unchanged even at week 12 [36]. Here we report a delayed Gag-specific response (at week 48, when the last 252 dose of vaccine was given at week 12). Administration of IL-2 and GM-CSF, in cART-treated patients with 253 incomplete/failed immune reconstitution despite virological suppression, was found to result in HIV-1-254 specific proliferative responses and IL-2 production [37, 38]. We further documented the beneficial effects 255 of rhGH on T-cell function in treated HIV-1 infection [28, 29], and concurred with findings describing a 256 reduction in T-cell activation and apoptosis markers following rhGH therapy in such subjects [24, 29]. 257 Changes observed herein were most striking for subjects who received all the interventions, suggesting a 258 combinatorial outcome of these agents with distinct biological effects. 259 260 Initial cytokine-induced immune activation at week 2 was short-lived. Overall there was a reduction in 261 activation state for individuals who received IL-2 and GM-CSF. Furthermore, this was accompanied by 262 decreased expression of the negative regulator, PD-1. Expression of this exhaustion marker was found to be 263 reduced on both CD4 and CD8 T cells at week 48 compared to baseline for all treatment groups regardless of 264 randomisation, which may be an effect of prolonged cART. Kassu et al., found the percentage of HIV-1-265 specific CD4+IFN-+PD-1+ T cells to be significantly lower in cART-treated patients compared to untreated 266 Page 11 of 19 viraemic subjects [39], and PD-1 has been proposed as a marker to identify individuals on long-term 267 suppressive cART with incomplete immune reconstitution [40]. 268 269 Vaccine was anticipated to induce recovery of virus-specific responses [11], and these responses were 270 expected to be enhanced by the administration of cytokines [41] and rhGH [3]. Delivery route of 271 immunisation may have influenced the resulting antigen-specific responses. The FIT Biotech DNA vaccine 272 was administered via ten intradermal injections, whereas another therapeutic DNA vaccine study reported 273 enhanced HIV-1-specific CD8 T-cell responses following immunisation on the skin [42]. In vivo 274 electroporation (EP) delivery of a DNA vaccine was found to significantly improve cellular immune 275 responses in terms of rate, magnitude, duration and breadth to a number of antigens [43], which concurred 276 with results from animal models demonstrating improved responses with EP [44]. The GTU\u00ae Multi-HIVB 277 vaccine used in untreated HIV-1+ individuals in South Africa induced antigen-specific responses, with 278 beneficial effects on plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 T-cell recovery, particularly following intramuscular 279 administration, and in individuals with certain HLA haplotypes [11]. 280 281 Patients across all groups showed reductions in proviral DNA but these could not be attributed to a particular 282 study arm. Subject B784, who showed the most improved Gag-specific responses at week 48 (in terms of 283 both IFN- and IL-2 production), also showed a reduction in proviral DNA. Recovery of IL-2 responses in 284 this individual may be due to low-level proviral DNA at baseline and the fact that this patient started cART 285 0.3 months after diagnosis. Studies have sought to optimise the timing and duration of cART. Initiation of 286 cART in early HIV-1 infection results in lower residual viral reservoirs [2, 45], lower levels of immune 287 activation and improved polyfunctionality of HIV-1-specific responses [45]. Furthermore, earlier initiation of 288 cART and higher nadir CD4 counts have been associated with functional responses to immunisation [46]. In 289 a study investigating IL-2 administration and immunisation with therapeutic HIV-1 vaccine Remune, 290 functional responses were not boosted in cART-treated HIV-1-infected patients who had low pre-cART CD4 291 counts [41]. This lack of immune recovery was postulated to be due to protracted immunosuppression and/or 292 clonal dysfunction [41], and differed from previous Remune studies which demonstrated proliferative 293 responses in patients that had higher pre-cART CD4 counts [47]. For this reason, patients enrolled in this 294 study were carefully selected, particularly in terms of CD4 counts and suppressed viraemia. Our findings 295 Page 12 of 19 from subject B784 suggest that, in addition to such criteria, earlier cART in combination with 296 immunotherapy might represent a future approach. 297 298 Responses were not measured at week 3 of the study, when the effect of five days treatment with rhGH may 299 have been most apparent. Hence, the authors appreciate that the benefit of such a short course of rhGH may 300 be difficult to detect immunologically, particularly as the majority of previous rhGH studies in the context of 301 HIV-1 infection tend to give rhGH for 12 weeks or more [23-29]. 302 303 Despite ninety-three patient referrals and twenty-one screen visits, only 12 patients who met the eligibility 304 criteria were enrolled onto the trial. This discrepancy (why so few referred patients were screened) was 305 primarily due to: an inability to commit to the treatment schedule/work commitments, subjects not meeting 306 the baseline CD4 T-cell requirement, acute illness prior to baseline and previous immunotherapy. We 307 acknowledge that due to small numbers we have lost the power to show a significant difference as predicted 308 when the sample size was estimated, however, despite the low numbers, we showed significant changes in 309 CD4 T-cell counts and CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios for individuals who received therapeutic immunisation, IL-2, 310 GM-CSF, and rhGH, in addition to significant changes in T-cell function and phenotype for subjects in this 311 group at week 48 compared to baseline. The results have been presented with 95% confidence intervals, and 312 the width of these depend directly on the sample size: large studies produce narrow intervals and, therefore, 313 more precise results. When we looked at individual patient responses, importantly, all subjects randomised to 314 group 1 demonstrated increased CD4 T-cell counts and improved CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios at week 48 315 compared to baseline, however we acknowledge with a small sample size it is difficult to distinguish 316 between a real effect and random variation. Despite this limitation, our research hypothesis was tested in a 317 small number of subjects thus avoiding spending too many resources, e.g. subjects, time and financial costs, 318 on finding an association. With the described associations found, a larger confirmatory study is needed to 319 confirm our findings. Another limitation of small study size is an over estimation of the magnitude of an 320 association. Furthermore, lack of statistical significance in the work presented should also be viewed with 321 caution, as with small sample sizes, results may have just missed statistical significance. Despite the 322 limitations highlighted, linear mixed model was utilised to analyse the data, in addition to simple descriptive 323 methods, as the intended sample size was not recruited. Both methods showed similar data trends, and data 324 Page 13 of 19 presented in this manuscript are from the mixed model (as detailed in section 2.8). The normality of the data 325 could be assumed, as within patient changes from baseline to each of the study time points are presented, and 326 these time points are spaced out relatively closely in time from baseline. The overall objective of this 327 repeated measures study design was to make inferences about the expected values of the immunological 328 (functional and phenotypic) data, and about the means of the populations from which study subjects were 329 sampled. This was done in terms of treatment and time effects in the mixed model - in order to estimate 330 differences between means at different study time points for the same treatment. These are inferences about 331 the fixed effects in the model. The problems with statistical inference for fixed effects have been associated 332 with missing or unbalanced data and complex covariance structures. The design of this study was intended to 333 apply repeated measures statistical method. 334 335 The authors appreciate that larger studies employing these agents and/or others are needed to fully elucidate 336 the clinical benefit of such therapies. Longer treatment with rhGH at a lower dose represents a possible 337 addition to such a study design, as this has been associated with improved thymic function, improved T-cell 338 functionality, and few adverse events [25, 29]. In the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) mouse 339 model, blockade of IL-10 or PD-1 during therapeutic DNA immunisation or vaccinia vector vaccination, 340 respectively, enhanced control of LCMV, suggesting concurrent blockade of both might be beneficial [48]. 341 Combining IL-2 administration and PD-L1 blockade in the mouse model of LCMV reduced viral load and 342 increased virus-specific CD8 T-cell responses [49], again lending weight to the idea of synergistic approach. 343 Longer term follow up would show whether or not these improvements are maintained. As we strive towards 344 a unified consensus regarding combinatorial strategies [50], optimal timing and dosing regimens, given the 345 antigen loss post-cART [3], and as the field moves toward a curative approach [10], the focus of prospective 346 immunotherapy will not only be to induce and maintain increased T-cell functionality, improve 347 immunophenotypes and confer clinical benefit, but also to target the latent viral reservoir. Such successful 348 immune-based therapy may require different step-wise novel approaches and larger patient cohorts. 349 Acknowledgements 350 The authors would like to thank Merck Serono Limited, in particular Richard Coles and Harriet Chronis, for 351 the rhGH and their support.

Treatment schedule overview. Patients were eligible to participate in the study if they were over 18 363 years of age, chronically infected with HIV-1, on a stable cART regimen for 6 months, if they had a current 364 CD4 T-cell count of >400 cells/mm3, and a plasma viral load of <50 copies/ml. Subjects could not be 365 receiving or have received immunomodulatory drugs or immunisation. Twelve patients who met the 366 eligibility criteria were randomised into one of three arms of the trial: i) to receive the GTU\u00ae-MultiHIV 367 DNA Clade B vaccine (FIT Biotech Plc, Tampere, Finland) at baseline, followed by administration of IL-2 368 week 1, and rhGH (Somatropin, Saizen; Merck-Serono International, 370 Geneva, Switzerland) for five days during week 2, with vaccine further administered at weeks 6 and 12 371 (n=3); ii) to receive vaccine alone (n=4); or iii) to receive cytokines and rhGH alone (n=5), all at the 372 aforementioned time points. Vaccine was administered at 1mg/ml as 10 intradermal injections (five 100\u00b5l 373 injections per arm); IL-2 given twice daily, 5x106 Units, administered by subcutaneous injection, 8 hours 374 apart; GM-CSF, 150\u00b5g, was administered subcutaneously once daily, 4 hours from the IL-2; and rhGH self-375 administered subcutaneously daily at 4mg/day. Blood was drawn at two screen visits, at baseline (week 0) 376 and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48. Throughout the period of the study, routine analysis of serum 377 glucose along with chemical gauges of urinary and endocrine function (sodium, potassium, chloride, urea, 378 creatinine), liver function (bilirubin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase), thyroid function (Free T4, TSH), 379 lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL), and other metabolic indicators (total protein, albumin, 380 globulin, calcium, phosphate, amylase) was undertaken. It is notable that prior to beginning the study the 381 majority of patients had levels of serum triglycerides above normal range (<2.0 mmol/L). As patients had 382 Page 15 of 19 well controlled HIV-1 infection, elevations in the levels of triglycerides could either be genetic and/or 383 cART-related. 384 Fig. 2. CD4 and CD8 (B) T-cell counts and 385 CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios (C) are depicted for each of the treatment groups: group 1 in blue circles, group 2 in 386 green squares, and group 3 in red triangles. Mean change from baseline to the study time point (week) is 387 plotted in each instance, with error bars displaying the 95% confidence interval. Asterisks indicate statistical 388 significance, where p 0.05 (as detailed in materials and methods, section 2.8). 389 Fig. 3. Impact of immunotherapy on T-cell function and phenotype. Plots show mean change from baseline 390 to each of the study time points with the error bars representing the 95% confidence interval. PBMC were 391 stimulated with overlapping Gag p17/p24 peptides (FIT Biotech); IFN- (A) and IL-2 (B) production was 392 determined by calculating the number of spot forming cells (SFC) per million PBMC. Surface expression of 393 the activation marker CD38 was assessed on both CD4 (C) and CD8 (D) T cells, as was the percentage 394 expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1 on both T-cell subsets (E and F, respectively). The mean 395 fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the apoptosis marker CD95 was also evaluated on CD4 (G) and CD8 (H) T 396 cells. This was done for each study time point, and the treatment groups are as previous: group 1 in blue 397 circles, group 2 in green squares, and group 3 in red triangles. Asterisks indicate statistical significance, 398 where p 0.05. 399 Fig. 4. Individual patient changes in T-cell function and phenotype. Representative plots show IFN- (light 400 grey bar) and IL-2 (dark grey bar) production in response to Gag p17/p24 peptide stimulation throughout the 401 course of the study, and the simultaneous alterations in CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation (in terms of CD38 402 expression; light blue circles and dashed line, and dark blue circles and solid line, respectively) for 403 individuals in group 1: G739 (A) and B784 (B). For comparison, a representative plot from a subject in 404 group 2 (C319) is also shown (C), but here CD4 activation is shown in light green squares and dashed lines, 405 and CD8 activation in dark green squares and solid lines. The right y-axis corresponds to the functional 406 response and changes in spot forming cells (SFC) compared to baseline are shown. The left y-axis 407 corresponds to changes in percentage CD38 expression at each of the study time points compared to 408 baseline. 409 Page 16 of 19 References 410 [1] Montaner JS, Hogg R, Wood E, Kerr T, Tyndall M, Levy AR, Harrigan PR.
