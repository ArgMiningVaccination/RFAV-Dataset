It increases healing and immunity and supports physical and emotional health. It is a safe, painless way to treat a wide range of medical conditions. Q: What does an acupuncturist do? A: An acupuncturist gathers information about your condition to determine imbalances of Qi (vital energy) that may be contributing to your health problems. After detection of imbalances, an acupuncturist places fine, sterile needles at specific points of the body. The use of needles can unblock the obstruction and balance Qi. Qi can then freely move to cells, organs, glands, tissues, and muscles. This can stop pain and repair balance and harmony, as well as the body's ability to heal itself. Q: What is Qi (pronounced \"chee\")? A: At the core of this ancient medicine is the philosophy that Qi, the vital energy, flows throughout the body along specific pathways called meridians. Qi animates the body and protects it from illness, pain, and disease. Q: Will the insertion of the acupuncture needles hurt? A: Generally speaking, the insertion of acupuncture needles does not cause pain in patients. The needles themselves are extremely thin. The needles stay close to the surface, within the skin itself.
