Separate regional level reports for county or community regions also accompany this statewide report for Hawai i County, Maui County, Honolulu County, Kaua i County and Community Region, East Hawai i Community Region, West Hawai i Community Region, Maui Community Region, Canoe Community Region, Honolulu Community Region, Windward O ahu Community Region, Leeward O ahu Community Region, Central O ahu Community Region. All public reports from the 2019 -2020 Hawai i Student Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Dru g Use (ATOD) Survey may be found at the Hawaii State Department of Health Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division website . Data-driven Planning for Substance use Prevention & Treatment Planning for youth substance use prevention and treatment may be best informed by data that is current and relevant. Although health surveys such as the ongoing Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) are a valuable surveillance tool to assess trends over time f or participating states and nationally, items are usually only a limited set of questions that ask about substance use. The Hawai i Student ATOD Survey historically provided a more comprehensive assessment on youth substance use and related risk a nd protective factors until the last previous administration in 2007 -2008. In order to provide updated data to the State of Hawai i on youth substance use from a comprehensive approach, the Hawaii Student ATOD Survey was conducted in 2019 -2020 to provide some continuity to the 2007 -2008 ATOD Survey but also to embrace opportunity for change and innovation in design, assessment methods, and survey items in order to be responsive to current needs around prevention and treatment in the current decade. As in prior Hawaii Student ATOD Surveys, the 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey includes prevalence data on current and lifetime use of major substance use categories, with updated definitions for indicators of binge drinking, frequent moderate -heavy use, and early initiati on of substances. The most widely used substances have been emphasized throughout the report - alcohol, tobacco, vaping, and marijuana - although data on other prescription and illicit 2 drug use are presented. Additionally, p rioritization of risk and protec tive factors for prevention and intervention in survey items are reflected in this report with through modeling approaches not available a decade ago. With the advancements in the field of statistical modeling and youth substance use, we introduce some of applications that inform predicting substance use in a more contemporary approach than in previously reported risk and protective factors correlated to problem substance use or were examined by demographic groups. Contexts around youth substance use in Haw aii may also be important to consider for various stakeholders that represent youth -serving organizations, policymakers, and our state's educational and health systems. Understanding Data: Walk-through of Sample Table and Figure Although some infographi cs (information presented in a graphic style) are interspersed throughout this report, much of the data are represented with percentages in a Table or Figure to show some type of comparison. In the Sample Table below, the indicator of interest to a reader is likely the percent within the \"Yes\" column (circled in red) that screened as having a probable substance use disorder (SUD) on the CRAFFT. The Table shows that overall , 11.1% of the state sample screened as having a probable SUD (highlighted in yellow ), but when looking at the percent by grade level , the probable SUD screen rate increases from 6.6% among 8th graders, to 11.9% in 10th graders, and 15% in 12th graders (highlighted in blue ), suggesting that problem substance use increases as students move up in grade or get older. Other columns contain information ab out the estimated number or counts (n) or may also include the range for an estimated 95% confidence interval (CI95%) next to the calculated percent. The notation \"weighted percents\" means that the data were weighted to adjust for enrollments to lessen the effects of a sample bias . For more about weighted data, see Chapter 3 section on Sample Description .

The 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey data (circled in red) s h o w s t h a t 1 6 . 5 % o f 8th graders, 26.5% of 10th graders, and 40.1% of 12th graders reported drinking alcohol in the past 30 days. While there was no similar data available for the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) for 8th graders nationally, the data from Hawaii YRBS (circled in blue ) which asked a similar question about alcoho l use in the past 30 days also showed an increasing pattern of use from 8th to 12th grade, but at lower rates than the 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey. The data from the national YRBS for 10th and 12th grades (highlighted in yellow ) were more like the 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey, while the data from the national Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey (highlighted in blue ) were more similar to the Hawai i YRBS. Although not all figures include a comparison of other data sources, many of the figures on substance use are shown for comparisons by demographic factors (i.e., by grade, by gender, or by primary race/ethnicity). It may be helpful to navigate to a table or figure of interest using the Table of Tables , or Table of Figures , and then read the accompanying narrative in that section. Key Takeaways and Recommendations There are several key takeaways ( Chapter 8 ) and recommendations (Chapter 9 ) offered in the report. However, they generally highlight implications from the main findings from the survey. There may be additional implications from the data that are relevant and useful to help inform program planning and policy directions for a broad range of audiences. As mentioned above, the findings for county and community regions may be used to describe youth substance use and risk and protective factors for a geographic region. Taken together with the overall state level findings, these county and community region reports may show similarities and differences in prevention and treatment needs in different ways that may have implications for programs and practice for our respective communities. 4 Chapter 2 Background & Significance of the ATOD Survey The Hawaii Student Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use (A TOD) Survey has been part of an ongoing project to guide prevention programs and treatment policy for adolescent substance use in Hawaii for the past several decades. The long -term effort began with a study conducted from 1987 -1993, by the Hawai'i State D epartment of Education (DOE) and the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. From 1996 -2003 the survey was administered about every two years by the State of Hawai'i Department of Health, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division (ADAD) in collaboration with the University of Hawai'i Speech Department. From 2006 -2008, including a pilot study from 2006 -2007, the survey was administered in collaboration between ADAD and University of Hawaii Department of Psychiatry (DOP) to participating public school students wit hin grades 6, 8, 10, and 12 who had written parental consent to take part in the study . The statewide Hawaii Student Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use Study was last conducted in 2007 -2008 to comprehensively assess prevention and treatment needs and measure substance use and risk and protective factors among sampled students in Hawaii (Goebert et al., 2010) . For a summary of differences between the 2007 -2008 and 2019 -2020 ATOD Surveys see Table 1 at the end of this chapter - for more detail on the u pdated survey design and method for the 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey see Chapter 3. Risk and Protective Factor Approach/framework The most recent iteration of the Hawaii Student ATOD Survey , administered in 2019 -2020, continued to assess treatment and prevention needs utilizing the risk and protective factors framework , as recommended by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (Pearson, 2004) . Research on risk and protective factors have focused on multiple domains, notably family, school, community, peer, and individual (Hawkins et al., 1992; Newcomb, 1995; Newcomb & Felix- Ortiz, 1992; Scheier et al., 1994) . Risk factors in this report are defined as \"those characteristics, variables, or hazards that, if present for a given individual, make it more likely that this individual, rather than someone selected at random from the general population, will develop a disorder\" (Institute of Medicine, 1994) . Protective factors are defined as characteristics that reduce the \"likelihood of problem behavior either directly or by mediating or moderatin g the effect of exposure to risk factors\" (Arthur et al., 2002) . Risk factors are often the precursors to drug and alcohol problems and protective factors are often the insulating components that minimize risk by improving coping, adaptation, and individua l competence to resist temptation to use substances. Unique to this study is an approach that does not emphasize one risk or protective factor over another. The position of this study is that youths' vulnerability to use and abuse of various substances is the result of numerous risk factors to which an adolescent is exposed, and no single predictor can best explain a given behavior. Conversely, protective psychosocial factors can directly limit or reduce ATOD involvement (Newcomb & Fel ix-Ortiz, 1992) or can act as a buffer to moderate the association between risk factors and ATOD use (Institute of Medicine, 1994; Newcomb & Felix- Ortiz, 1992) . 5 The need for prevention research and interventions is challenging as substance use or abuse ha s been causally related to depression, suicide, teen pregnancy, delinquency, and violence among adolescents (Dryfoos, 1990) . Substance use has also been shown to be associated with conduct problems (Mason et al., 2008) . Reducing risk and enhancing protecti on across these domains could positively impact a wide range of behavioral outcomes. Risk factors need not be directly manipulated. Instead, they may be moderated by certain protective factors within the same domain. These moderating protective factors m ay operate directly on a previous risk factor or indirectly by mediating the relationship between the factor and a potential outcome (Institute of Medicine, 1994) . Identified protective factors can inhibit drug use among those at risk and prevention approa ches may mediate or moderate the effects of exposure to risk. Protection against ATOD use is associated with rewards to adolescents for pro - social involvement in family, school, and community domains as well as the development of effective social skills among peers and bonding with significant adults (Hawkins et al., 1992; Rutter, 1987; Werner, 1989) . Examining protective factors reveals how these factors operate to simply reduce the number of individual related risk factors (Sher, 1994) . Consequently, prot ective factors are critical when risk factors for adolescent ATOD use are not amenable to change (Hawkins et al., 1992) . Put simply, strengthening protective factors is a viable means of working with youth who are at a high risk for substance use. Several diverse factors predict substance abuse, often with greater risk of substance abuse associated with increasing numbers of multiple risk factors. The presence of one or more protective processes reduces the probability of negative outcomes associate d with risk exposure. An overview of risk and protective factors for domains from a social- ecological perspective is described in Chapter 3. Assessing risk and protective factors in various domains through an epidemiol ogical approach will be useful in guiding prevention policy. Where resources are limited, these data may inform how best to prioritize targeted risk and protective factors as the focus for prevention intervention, particularly in communities with high need s but few resources. The 2019- 2020 ATOD Survey project examined these important risk and protective factors as well as the prevalence and severity of ATOD use in youths to assist ADAD and a broad range of stakeholders in planning prevention and treatment efforts aimed at decreasing this problem in the State of Hawaii . Contexts Related to Substance Use As an important layer to examining risk and protective factors, because of the ethno -racial, geographic, and cultural diversity within our State, attention has been increasing on cultural contexts related to risk and protective factors and substance use and prevention (Jeffries, 1999; Nishimura et al., 2005; Unger et al., 2004) . Factors such as acculturation (Chedebois et al., 2009; Saint -Jean et al., 2008) , and differential rates of substance use and risk among ethno -racial groups (Price et al., 2002) or rural -urban differences in risk factors (Martino et al., 2008) may need to be considered in guiding culturally appropriate substance abuse prevention and tre atment programs (Catalano et al., 1993) . 6 Study Objective The primary objective of this study was to provide a needs assessment of middle and high school students to build upon Hawai'i's past efforts in youth substance use research. The report provides an assessment of the nature and scope of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use among participating school students in grades 8, 10, and 12 throughout the state of Hawai'i. Additionally, the report contributes to risk and protective factor data that the State o f Hawai'i and other sources can use to assist in planning evaluation, prevention, and treatment programs.

At -a-glance summary of highlighted differences between the 2007 -2008 and 2019 -2020 Hawai i ATOD Surveys 2007 -2008 ATOD Survey 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey Approach Administered as part of the triad of School Health Surveys (Youth Risk Behavior Survey, Youth Tobacco Survey, and ATOD Survey) Administered as a single comprehensive survey focused on substance use Sampling Frame 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th grades at schools for statewide complex level, in alignment with the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) sampling 8th, 10th, and 12th grades at schools selected for community region level and island representation, including schools that are high need but in under -resourced communities Coordination & Administration UH Team worked with school liaison to coordinate class selection and schedule trainings w ith teachers who distributed and tracked consent forms, and administered survey to class UH Team + Community -based Field Site Coordinator worked with school administrators and designated school liaison to coordinate class selection and logistics; UH Team administered survey to class Parent Consent Active parent consent (opt -in) Passive parent consent (opt -out) Survey Format Paper and pencil survey Primarily online + paper and pencil as needed Survey Items Lengthy DSM -III-R diagnostic criteria used for substance abuse or dependence; more risk related factors assessed Update d items for gender, stable place to sleep; items related to culture ; briefer CRAFFT screen for probable substance use disorder; inclusion of mental health and attention screens ; more protective factor items ; assessing vaping behavior separate from smoking tobacco cigarettes Dissemination Public state level, county/district reports on ADAD website; confidential school/complex reports for limited schools upon request Public state level, county, community region reports on ADAD website; confidential school reports returned for all schools that meet participation level criteria + dissemination to school communities as requested; ongoing community dissemination by UH 7 Chapter 3 Design & Method Relational Design Approach The initial design phase of the ATOD survey was informed by preliminary consultation with ADAD. As indicated by the arrow in Figure 1, the survey was designed with the end -goal of the s t u d y i n m i n d , i . e . , h o w t o d i s s e m i n a t e t h e findings to key stakeholders and decision - makers effectively. Miao and colleagues (Helm et al., 2020) have conceptualized this as a relational design approach. In addition to the quantitative school -based needs assessment approach with the 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey, a parallel qualitative youth needs assessment was conducted focusing on special populations of youth that may be less likely to complete a school -based survey. This companion report may be found at the Hawai i State Department of Health Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division website . Developed in close collaboration with ADAD, the survey instru ment was updated to address relevant and timely issues related to youth substance use. The 2019- 2020 ATOD study design featured several other significant updates in comparison to earlier administrations of the survey (Figure 2) . The survey sampling strategy was designed to represent community regions including those under -resourced . A passive parent consent (opt -out) protocol was a major accomplishment for the project. Passive consent facilitates a higher rate of student participation by removing the common barrier of lost or missing consent forms that is often associated with an active consent protocol. Web -based administration of the survey was promoted to decrease the burden of data management and quality assurance. Paper survey s were still administered on a case -by-case basis, as a response to concerns such as inconsistent internet service at certain schools. Finally, the current design introduced a new practice intended to strengthen community - school partnerships and reduce the burden that the survey might pose to classroom teachers. Community -based field site coordinators were hired and trained to serve as project liaisons to the schools, leading the communications and coordination, and proctoring the surveys with students in p articipating classes. As intend ed in the relational design approach, field site coordinators were also important in actively tailoring dissemination efforts by providing Design Disseminate Implement (DATA ) Collect Administer Surveys Manage AnalyzeRelational Design of the Hawai `i Student ATOD Survey Figure 1. Relational design with dissemination goal as the driver for informing the design of the survey project Figure 2. The 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey approach was designed to include innovation and improvements. 8 feedback around the survey findings and reports, as well as for close coordination wit h school administrators, e.g., to provide presentations of the findings back to participating schools and broader stakeholder communities . Survey Sampling Strategy The sampling strategy for the 2019 -2020 Survey included survey middle & intermediate school students (8th graders) and high school students (10th and 12th graders). Previous studies in Hawaii have shown low rates of substance use among 6th graders (Goebert et al., 2010) . In addition, sixth grade is not uniformly matriculated in middle or interm ediate schools, but also includes elementary schools. Taking these two points into account, the survey and methodology was streamlined by omitting 6th grade students from the sampling frame. Therefore, the 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey was conducted using a two -stage cluster sample design, aimed at obtaining a representative sample for 8th, 10th, and 12th graders in each community region. Community regions were defined to ensure not only district, but also island representation (Figure 3) . Kauai County is considere d one community region. On Oahu, there are four community regions identified by district, including Central, Honolulu, Leeward, and Windward. Maui County was represented by two regions \u2014 Canoe, which include d Lanai, Molokai and Hana communities ; and the Maui community region . Hawaii Island was divided into two community regions \u2014East Hawaii and West Hawaii. Furthermore, communities which ha d demonstrated high need and few resources and were not originally selected in the sampling frame were additionally included as a subgroup of interest. In the first stage of sampling , schools within each community region were randomly selected by grade level with replacement. \"With replacement \" means that high schools selected for the 10th grade may or may not have been the same schools selected for the 12th grade. Additionally, schools that were not selected but which have demonstrated high need and few resources will be inclu ded. This resulted in 44 schools included in the sample out of a total of 87. The geographic distribution of schools, community regions, and selections were reviewed and approved by ADAD. Public reports do not identify individual schools . Public reports are available at the statewide, county, and community region levels. In the second stage of sampling , classrooms were selected in each grade for a chosen school to include approximately 75 students per grade level (about 3 classes per scho ol based on an average class size for high response rates ) for the survey data . All randomly selected schools and high need/low access school -communities were invited to participate. A recruitment letter was sent to principals in summer 2019, introducing the research team, briefly explaining the study, and requesting the school's participation and a contact person to be designated as the school liaison. A follow up meeting was proposed to the school to provide the same information in the introductory lette r and to request participation. For schools that agreed to participate, the designated school liaison was later contacted by Figure 3. Community region sampling frame StatewideKaua i Oahu Moloka i, Lana i, HanaMauiHawai i Island9 phone or in -person by one of the DOP staff members. The meeting by phone or face- to-face provided more details of the study, how th e survey would be administered, determined if the survey would be administered online or by paper -pencil, and initiated the procedures for grade/classroom selection. While participation was at the discretion of the school administrator, facilitators of participation included : the existing State of Hawaii interagency collaboration between ADAD and DOE ; outreach to the schools by either the ATOD Survey Principal Investigator (PI), Co -PI, or Investigator and the field site coordinator to encourage participation ; and small tokens of appreciation (e.g., school supplies) for the school. Table 2. 2019 -2020 Hawai'i Student ATOD Survey Participation Rate by County and Grade Sample Description Overall p articipation rate for the 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey was 88.5%, which was a considerable improvement over the 58.7% participation rate from the 2007 -2008 ATOD Survey ( Table 2). Participation rates by grade and county were also generally high. Data were weighted based on the sampling frame and led to adjustments for enrollments to lessen the effects of a sample bias. A statewide weighted sample was obtained, where weights were applied for each school and grade level using corresponding pre -calcu lated scores from the academic enrollment prior to the survey year.1 The overall weighted sample consisted of 8,225 students from public middle and high schools in Hawaii who participated in the survey administration. Table 2 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the sample. Gender was determined using the survey question asking students their current gender. Students who indicated Other or Transgender were combined into the category of \"Transgender and Other Gender Minority (TGGM) \" and also categorized as \"gender diverse\" in this report. Race/ethnicity was determined using the survey question asking students which ethnic or racial group(s) they primarily identified with. Students who chose more than one response were grouped together into the category of \"2 or more ethnicities.\" Due to relatively small sample sizes for some ethnicities, certain groups were combined. Students who reported their primary identity as Samoan, Chuukese, Marshallese or other Pacific Islander were grouped into the category of \"Other Pacific Islander.\" The ca tegory of \"Other Asian\" include d student who reported that they primarily identified as Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, or other ethnicities from East, South or Southeast Asia. The \"Other\" ethnicity category 1 Weighted percentages are reported because the sampling frame was based on a random selection of students from schools and gra de included in the sample using the prior academic enrollment counts to generate a corresponding weight score which was to be applied in the analyses to represent estimates for the overall sample.

Among those who selected 2 or more ethnic/racial groups, Native Hawaiian was among the highest therefore, the table shows the percentage of students that selected Native Hawaiian and those that did not. 11 Survey Administration Procedures At least one week prior to the scheduled survey administration day, parent opt -out consent forms were given to the participating schools for distribution to selected classes to be taken home. On the day of the survey, the field site coordinator(s) worked w ith the school liaison and teachers of selected classes to verify students on the class roster who were eligible to participate in the study. Students who were opted out from parental consent w ere asked to complete assigned homework or read quietly or othe r alternate activity approved by the teacher . Both online and on paper, the student assent page explained the purpose of the study, importance of the survey, what the student was being asked to do and how long the survey was expected to take, the nature of the questions, that the information they provided was anonymous and confidential, the right to stop participating at any time without penalty, that there were no direct benefits to the student, and contact information for any questions. Student assent was indicated by clicking on the response \"I agree\" to continue to the survey. For the paper -pencil format, the student assent page stated that assent was determined to have been given by the student by continuing to the next page and participating in the sur vey. Online Survey The online survey was programmed on a web -based platform to maintain the optimal format of the survey while also allowing for the informed assent process and maintaining anonymity and confidentiality of student responses. The 2006 -2007 pilot study showed feasibility of administering an online survey, and since that time, many public schools currently have the capacity for classrooms to access the internet for an online survey to be administered. The field site coordinator worked with t he school liaison to arrange for the computer facilities and student access to the internet for the day of survey administration. The field site coordinator(s) briefly explain ed the importance of the study and how anonymity and confidentiality w ould be maintained. Students were also informed in the survey that their teachers would remain at the front of the room or another room and would not be allowed to see the completed surveys. Instructions on how to access the website with custom URL and passwor d for the survey were given, and students were taken through the assent form by the field site coordinator(s) before proceeding to allow students to decide whether to participate. Upon completion of the survey, students w ere instructed to close their web b rowser, and when the administration period ended, students were thanked and dismissed from class. The online survey webpage was closed after each class was finished with the survey. Paper -pencil Format The paper -pencil version of the survey was supplied by the field site coordinator prior to or on the date of the survey administration, as arranged with the school liaison. The field site coordinator worked with the respective teachers to verify students on the class roster who w ere eligible to participate in the s urvey . Students w ho were opted out of parental consent w ere asked to complete assigned homework or read quietly or other alternate activity approved by the teacher . As with the online version of the survey, t he field sit e coordinator briefly explain ed the importance of the study and how anonymity and confidentiality 12 would be maintained. Students are also informed in the survey that their teachers would remain at the front of the room or another room and would not be allow ed to see the completed surveys. Instructions on how to fill out the survey were given, and students were taken through the assent process. C omplet ed surveys were collected in to a large envelope and sealed by the field site coordinator and returned to the Department of Psychiatry. When the administration period ended, students were thanked and dismissed from class. Confidentiality and Anonymity Survey s were collected anonymously , meaning students' names w ere not collected. Students' responses were confidential , meaning that individuals' responses w ere not shared, but w ould be reported in aggregate to the extent possible. Anonymity and confidentiality are important because of the sensitive nature of the inform ation collected in this study, and the need for accurate and candid responses by the students. Student names or other identifying information w ere not placed on surveys. On the day of the survey administration, the field site coordinator explain ed to the students the nature of the study, the importance and value of the survey, and the steps that will be taken to assure confidentiality and anonymity. Since the surveys only contain school and grade identification, there will be no way to link individual surveys to specific students. The online survey data was managed by the University of Hawaii. Paper -pencil surveys will be destroyed after the data are cleaned, merged with the online survey data, and the final report is approved by ADAD. Data are protected on an encrypted server or computer with password protection. Access to the data was limited to the DOP research team, ADAD and connecting parties, and individuals given permission by ADAD. Data Management As part of data quality checks, research staff ex amine d each paper -pencil survey prior to transfer to the primary database. Data cleaning also involve d checks in the data for responses or patterns that we re inconsistent (e.g., said yes in one item, but similar item later said no), or marked multiple resp onses for a single choice item . If they were not manually correctable at the point of data entry, those questions were omitted in the final data set. All data entry transfers from paper to the data set were quality checked against the paper surveys. T he result was a clean, edited data set for analyses. 13 Collaborative & Iterative Development of Survey Items Following the Relational Design Approach , the finalized measures for assessing treatment needs were selected through a collaborative and iterative process with ADAD and DOP , including feedback from the field site coordinators and consultat ion with other stakeholder experts, to determine the most appropriate and relevant components and tools (Figure 4). Innovations and improvements to the survey included an update of demographic items, better balance of protective and risk factor items, incl usion of mental health and attention screens, items related to culture, and assessing vaping behavior separate from smoking tobacco cigarettes . (see the Appendix for a copy of The 2019 -2020 Hawaii ATOD Survey ) Measures Demographic Information Demographic items included the following: Age; Grade; Parent or Family in the Military or Reserve/National Guard; Live on a Hawaiian Homestead; Any and Prim ary Identification for Race /Ethnicity ; Primary Language Spoken in Household; Sex assigned at birth; Gender; Place Usually Sleep; Parent/Caregiver Level of Education (as proxy for socioeconomic status). See above Table 3 with demographic characteristics of the statewide sample. Culture Because when combined with other protective factors, expression of the importance of maintaining one's cultural traditions and having a strong sense of belonging to one's ethnic group may be protective against substance use, these items related to culture were included on the ATOD Survey. Similarly, s peaking a primary language other than English in the home may increase protection from substance use for middle and high school students, reflecting a protective factor among families which may range from recent immigrants from outside the U.S. to Native Hawaiian families who are intentional about language preservation and cultural perpetuation.

Components of the ATOD Survey 14 Measures of Treatment Need and Substance use Treatment Need: CRAFFT Estimated need for substance use treatment among adolescents was based on the cutoff s c o r e o f 4 o r h i g h e r (Figure 5) on the well - validated CRAFFT instrument3 (Knight et al., 2002; Knight et al., 1999; Shenoi et al., 2019) , indicating probable substance u se disorder (abuse/dependence, American Psychiatric Association DSM -IV and DSM -5). The CRAFFT screening tool is also used by th e DOE and by ADAD funded providers. Additionally, students were asked if they received treatment for substance use in the past 12 months and, if so, if they received treatment from school or a place other than school . Students were also asked if they ever thought they should seek help for substance use but did not . Substance Use Behaviors Substance categories emphasized in this report include the most prevalent alcohol, tobacco, vape, a nd marijuana use . Additionally, use of opioids , sedatives and other prescription (Rx) drugs, over -the- counter (OTC) drugs, and steroids are presented. Other drug use included inhalants, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, hallucinogens , and other illicit drugs . Current use was defined as any use ( o n e o r m o r e t i m e s ) o f a categorized substance in the past 30 days . Frequent or Moderate - heavy use was defined as 6 or more times in the past 30 days (Figure 6) which may include more frequent behaviors th at range from an average of weekly to daily. Binge drinking definitions (Figure 7) were updated for youth as 3+ standard drinks on one 3 Knight JR, Shrier LA, Bravender TD, Farrell M, Vander Bilt J, Shaffer HJ.

For students assigned male at birth, binge drinking was defined as 4+ drinks for 10th graders and 5+ drinks for 12th graders (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2021; Chung et al., 2018) . Lifetime use was determined if the student endorsed any first use of a substance category. Age of initiation was described as the age when a person first begins using a substance. Early initiation indicate d that a person's first use occurred at age 13 or younger. For current and moderate -heavy use, each category of substance was also further examined by grade, gender, and ethnicity. Mental Health & Attention Screen In addition to substance use indicators, mental health distress and attentional disorder were screened respectively using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ -44 , which collects symptoms related to depression and anxiety , and the Pediatric Symptom Checklist5 Attention Subscale for which a positive screen indicate d further assessment for ADD/ADHD. Risk & Protective Factors: Social Development Model and Social -ecological Domains Risk and protective factors for substance use among students based on the existing literature were measured for individual, peer, family, school, and community domains as well as contextual items from the literature related to substance use. To better understand protective factors and move toward a mo del for resilience, the 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey included a more balanced set of items to query students about protection as well as risk. All youth are exposed to both risk and protective factors that influence engagement in substance use. Youth substance us e arises from a complex interaction of individual, family, peer, community, and societal factors (United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, 2000) . As mentioned earlier, risk factors place individuals at greater than average risk for subs tance use , delinquency, and problem behaviors . (Arthur et al., 2002; Institute of Medicine, 1994) In contrast, the presence of protective 4 L\u00f6we B, Wahl I, Rose M, Spitzer C, Glaesmer H, Wingenfeld K, Schneider A, Br\u00e4hler E.

Binge drinking definition for youth accounts for grade level and sex assigned at birth. 16 factors appears to buffer youth from initiating or continuing substance use and decrease vulnerability to subsequent h ealth and social problems (Arthur et al., 2002; Hawkins et al., 1992) . With improvements in the survey items and contemporary modeling approaches, one of the innovations of this study includes factors associated with greater protection from or risk of substance use among students in Hawai'i which are described in more detail in Chapter Seven Social Ecological Risk & Protective Factor Resilience Model. Overview of Ri sk and Protective Factor Domains Risk and Protective Factors for Alcohol and Other Drug Problems in Adolescence and Early Adulthood: Implications for Substance Abuse Prevention is the seminal report in this field that has guided the majority of subsequent work and research on adolescent substance use (Hawkins et al., 1992) . Since publication, this article has been influential in shaping the direction of adolescent substance use research. See Table 18 in the Appendix for the corresponding survey questions and coding for Risk and Protective Factors for each of the following domains. Individual Domain The individual domain includes attitudes toward drug use, antisocial behavior, and other factors such as sensation seeking have also been linked to alcohol and other drug use among individual adolescents (Hawkins et al., 1992) . Favorable attitudes toward drug use, antisocial behavior, and sensation seeking are so me factors that have been linked to an increased risk for cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use (Beyers et al., 2004) . One individual risk factor commonly found to be associated with adolescent substance use is early initiation of problem behaviors including early use of substances . The younger individuals are at the initiation of alcohol use, the more likely they are to develop significant alcohol related problems (DeWit et al., 2000) . Negative peer influence, perceptions of the harmfulness of alcohol use , parents' alcohol use, and proactive parenting measured in the late stages of childhood have been shown to influence the age of alcohol use initiation (Hawkins et al., 1997) . Mental and behavioral health concerns, including antisocial behavior such as impulsivity, aggression, and conduct problems, have been shown to put adolescents at increased risk for substance use (Nation & Heflinger, 2006; Poikolainen, 2002; Swadi, 1999) . In adolescence, these issues have been linked to sensation -seeking, reduced perception of risk, and high reward sensitivity to ATOD use (Cleveland et al., 2008; Wagner, 2001) . Not surprisingly, studies have shown that adolescents' pro-drug beliefs were one of the best predictors of simultaneo us alcohol and marijuana use (Collins et al., 1998) . Among adolescents who intended to use substances, their own personal beliefs were more important than the beliefs of other important people in their lives (O'Callaghan & Hannon, 2003) . Additionally, O'Co nnor et al., (2007) showed that as adolescents grow older, they perceive more benefits from alcohol and tobacco use than negative consequences associated with substance use. Studies of adolescents have shown perceptions of harmfulness to be associated with drug and alcohol use. As expected, adolescents who associated harm with substance use were less likely to be users and vice versa (Alter 17 et al., 2006; Bachman et al., 1998; Danseco et al., 1999; Johnson al., al., 2006; O'Callaghan & Hannon, 2003) . See Table 18 in the Appendix for the Risk and Protective Factors and Corresponding 2019 -2020 Hawaii Student ATOD Survey Questions and Responses . Peer Domain Peer substance use and peer approval of substance use put students at a greater risk for substance use and problem use . Peer risk and protective factors have been reported to be strongly associated with both lifetime and recent substance use among adolescents (Cleveland et al., 2008) . Exposure to peer substance use and offers of substances from friends have been shown to be important risk factors. See Table 18 in the Appendix for the Risk and Protective Factors and Corresponding 2019 -2020 Hawaii Student ATOD Survey Questions and Responses . Family Domain Risk and protective factors research associated with the family domain has typically focused on the bond between parents and children and the outcome of disruptions to this relationship. Family sup port, parental supervision and having clear rules and consequences about substance use have been found as protective factors, while exposure to family alcohol and other drug use have been shown to be risk factors for youth substance use (Rusby et al., 2018 ). See Table 18 in the Appendix for the Risk and Protective Factors and Corresponding 2019 -2020 Hawaii Student ATO D Survey Questions and Responses . School Domain The school domain focuses on academic performance, educational aspirations, and school engagement among the surveyed adolescents in Hawai'i. Other major studies have found that students who indicated having strong school protective factors reported less substance use. Additionally, it has been reported that increasing student engagement and attachment to school should be a goal among adolescent s as it has been shown to reduce overall substance use (Guo et al., 2001) . See Table 18 in the Appendix for the Risk and Protective Factors and Corresponding 2019 -2020 Hawaii Student ATOD Survey Questions and Responses . Community Domain The community domain focuses on adolescents' personal interactions with other individuals in different areas or domains of his or her life distinct from friends (peer domain), teachers and class mates (school domain), and parents, siblings, and other relatives (family domain). Community factors, such as illegal substance use in the 18 neighborhood, drug selling or crime, and ease of access to substances have been shown as risk factors, while protecti ve factors include adults in the community favoring prosocial non- use of substances by youth and encouragement for youth positive behaviors . See Table 18 in the Appendix for the Risk and Protective Factors and Corresponding 2019 -2020 Hawaii Student ATOD Survey Questions and Responses . Contexts Related to Substance Use Access to Substances Access to substances was assessed through questions related to where and from whom substances were obtained or offered. Students were asked to select all that apply to the question \"During the past 12 months, how did you usually get ________ [alcohol, marijuana, tobacco/e -cigarettes, or other drugs]?\" - response options included no use in the past 12 months, store, restaurant/bar/club, a pub lic place, gave money to someone to buy it, got while at school, someone gave it to them, took it from a store, took from a family member, or some other way (open - ended). Open -ended responses were coded to match other categories whenever possible. Where U sually Use Substances Location of use for substances was assessed through questions that related to where students usually substances. Students were asked to select all that apply to the question \"During the past 12 month, where did you usually use _______ __ [alcohol, marijuana, tobacco/e -cigarettes, or other drugs]?\" - response options included no use in the past 12 months, at their home, at another person's home, while riding/driving in a vehicle, at a restaurant/bar/club, at a public place, on school pro perty, at a social event, or somewhere else (open -ended). Open -ended responses were coded to match other categories whenever possible. Prevention Messages and Knowledge New in the 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey were questions asking students if and how they recei ve prevention related messages and knowledge about dangers of alcohol and drugs. Personal sources of information about the dangers of alcohol, tobacco, or drug use included friends, parent/guardian, teacher, or someone else (open -ended); sources for public awareness messages included television or internet channels, radio or internet stations, social media or apps/websites, ads on devices, posters/signs/material in public, or other ways (open -ended). Analyses Using the weighted sample, d escriptive and biv ariate analyses were conducted on the data. Estimated treatment need and substance use indicators for alcohol, binge drinking, tobacco cigarette, vape/e -cigarette, and marijuana use were examined in the most detail. These findings are presented in Chapter 4 Youth Substance Use in Hawai'i and in the Appendix . 19 Note that due to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID -19) shutdown in Spring 2020, data collection during this period was not possible. All data were collected before the pandemic -related closure of schools. Where data were unavailable for a few schools, estimated scores for selected substance use and behavioral health indicators (e.g., treatment need, current use of substances, mental health symptom severity, attention dis order) were substituted using a composite from other selected schools based on knowledge of the community and matching of similar demographic characteristics (i.e., driving distance to major hospital, percent Native Hawaiian, and percent free/reduced lunch ) that were shown to be important variables of substance use treatment need from a statistical classification model analysis. For substance use indicators examined by grade, gender or race /ethnicity , no adjustments for missing schools were made, therefore percentages of reporting may be underreported or overreported . Data w ere also analyzed for the state, county, and community region level s to describe: (1) treatment needs and in specific subgroups ; (2) lifetime, past 30-day, and moderate -heavy use of subs tance s including for some specific subgroups ; and (3) risk and protective factors in specific subgroups (grade, ethnicity, and gender), Results were reported in tables and charts to describe various populations on each of the selected variables or indicat ors. In accordance with the Hawai i State Department of Health guideline, cell sizes with less than ten were suppressed. Comparisons to nationwide reports , where available, were made by comparing the findings in Hawaii with those reported during the clo sest available data year of the national and Hawaii Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Survey . The YRBS and MTF data presented for indicators examined by grade, as those sources were not able to be filtered to include a comparable percentage for combined 8th, 10th, and 12th grades - therefore, gender and race/ethnicity charts do not include these sources. Data were also analyzed to determine the association between risk and protective factors with prevalence and preventi on and treatment needs. Given the advances in statistical modeling approaches, the survey data were also used to build preliminary models for risk and protective factors for predicting problem substance use. See Chap ter 6 for details on the protective and risk factors that emerged as important across the social- ecological domains. The IBM \u00ae SPSS \u00a9 Statistics v.26 software was used to perform the primary analyses for the state, county, and community region reports. Mplus v.8 software was used for structural equation modeling analyses. 20 Chapter 4 Youth Substance Use in Hawai'i Overall Estimates of Treatment Need CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends or Family, and Trouble) is a validated screening tool to assess substance use and dependence for adolescents ages 12 -21. A score of two or three indicates positive risk of developing an SUD. A score of four or more indicates a probable substance use disorder (SUD) and treatment need . Although the 2019 -2020 Hawaii Student ATOD Survey utilized a screening instrument compared to the diagnostic criteria from the 2007 -2008 ATOD Survey and a different sampling frame, the overall total estimated treatment need across the state increased to 11.1% from the 7.7% reported estimated need from the previous study more than a decade ago. Given the literature on the higher risk of substance use with mental health and attentional behavioral diagnoses, two brief screens were added to the 2019 -2020 ATO D Survey. Mental Health distress was screened using the validated PHQ -4, which collects symptoms related to depression and anxiety . A positive screen on the Pediatric Symptom Checklist Attention Subscale indicates further assessment for ADD/ADHD. More than a third of students in the statewide sample (37% combined) report ed mild to severe levels of mental health distress in the past two weeks. Approximately 15% of students statewide also screened positive for a potential attention disorder. 74.5 14.311.1 Screen Neg Screen Pos Probable SUDHawai'i State: CRAFFT Screening (%) Figure 8.

Compared to both males ( 8.8%) and females (13. 1%), the inclusion of Transgender and Other Gender Minority (TGGM) , while a small group, indicates an elevated proportion of probable substance use disorder (24.4%). Adolescents most likely to have a probable substance use disorder primarily identified themselves as Other Pacific Islander (1 9.7%), Native Hawaiian (1 5.2%), Hispanic or Latino (16. 2%), and of 2 or more ethnicities including Native Hawaiian (13.5% ).

Infographic for statewide estimated probable substance use disorder treatment need for the overall state, by grade, and gender. 23 Probable SUD by Mental Health and Attention Screen Given the relationship of mental health disorders and substance use, the CRAFFT screen rates were examined by the mental health distress severity from the PHQ -4 screen. As shown in Fig ure 11, the rates of a probable SUD (score of 4+ on the CRAFFT) and also for a positive risk screen for an SUD increase (score 2 -3 on the CRAFFT) with increasing levels of mental health distress severity (mild 11.2%, moderate 17.9%, sever e 25.3% respectively) . Screening for attention related disorders found youth with a positive screen (which indicates further assessment for attentional disorders) had a percentage (19.5%) of probable substance use disorder, about twice that of those with a negative screen (9.6%). Treatment Need vs. Utilization Similar to the 2007 -2008 ATOD Survey, the 2019 -2020 ATOD Survey asked about receiving help for substance use problems. Among students that screened in the probable SUD range (4+ on the CRAFFT), only 29% reported getting help. Of those who screened in the risk positive range (2-3 on the CRAFFT), less than 17% received getting help. For both the probable and risk for SUD groups, help was received by students at school and outside of school for about half, while the remainder were equally likely to have received help at either school or outside of sch ool. A large majority of students that screened as needing treatment or at risk of an SUD were not receiving help even if they thought they should, or they did not think they were in need of help. In the low or no risk group (0 - 1 on the CRAFFT), about 4.5% of students reported receiving some help primarily both on and off campus.

Alcohol use by binge drinking and concurrent use of alcohol and marijuana use together were also commonly reported current substance use behaviors. Current use of over the counter (OTC) drugs, and sedatives and other prescription drugs without a doctor's instruction, were reported at a higher rate than use of inhalants, opioids, steroids, or other illicit drugs. The report emphasizes current findings for the above mentioned most prevalent substances used by youth (alcohol, vape/e -cigarettes, tobacco, and marijuana). Due to differences in the design, method and sampling frame, no direct comparisons can be made between the 2007 - 2008 and 2019- 2020 ATOD Surveys, h owever, additional tables for the purposes of illustrating historical contextual information from reanalyzed 2007 -2008 (excluding 6th grade from the sample) may be found in the Appendix . Figure 13. Lifetime use, any current use (in past 30 days), and moderate -heavy use (6+ times in the past 30 days) of substance categories. Note: Current Binge drinking uses the new 3/4/5+ drinks definition, while Binge drinking for lifetime and current moderate -heavy use is based on a survey item for 4+ drinks on one occasion; there was no survey item that asked about lifetime concurrent alcohol -marijuana use. Overall Age of Initiation of Alcohol and Substance Use The 2019 -2020 Hawai'i Student ATOD Study findings provide important and useful information on youth substance use in Hawai'i. Given the recognition of youth substance use as an ongoing public health issue, it is important to note that based on the Hawai'i Student ATOD Study findings, the \"gateway drugs\" ( alcohol, vape/ e- cigarettes, and marijuana) were the substances that students were more likely to use prior to the age of 14 . Due to the literature showing an association between early onset of substance use and later alcohol and drug problems, it is extremely important for prevention efforts to focus on students younger than 14 years of age. Overall, in the state, the substances more often reported for early initiation as being used at age 13 or younger, were alcohol, vape/e -cigarettes, and tobacco hetamineHallucinog ensOther Illicit Drugs State Lifetime Use 52.1 26.8 19.2 44.2 33.2 3.6 6.2 11.9 2.1 5.3 1.0 3.1 1.6 4.3 3.3 State Current Use 27.3 13.9 8.4 25.9 20.3 12.8 1.6 2.8 5.0 1.3 2.3 0.7 1.6 0.8 2.0 1.5 State Mod-Heavy Use 5.3 3.5 3.7 13.8 9.3 3.8 0.7 0.8 1.2 0.6 0.8 0.5 0.6 0.5 0.7 0.70102030405060Overall Lifetime, Current, & Moderate -Heavy Use (%) State Lifetime Use State Current Use State Mod-Heavy Use26 When further examining distributions for age of onset of use by substance, a peak for early initiation of alcohol occurs at 8 years of age or younger, but also later throughout adolescence . Patterns are seen for early initiation of vaping, marijuana and tobacco cigarette use around age 13, while binge drinking appears to primarily show a later peak for age of onset around 15-16 years of age (Figure 15 ). Alcohol Consequences of Alcohol Use from the Literature The negative consequences of adolescent alcohol use can be understood and analyzed at multiple levels. In 2018, the World Health Organization reported that more than a quarter of adolescents between the ages 15 -19 were Figure 14. Early initiation of substance use at 13 years or younger is seen most often for alcohol, vaping and tobacco cigarettes. Figure 15.

For the individual, early alcohol use can have neurodevelopmental impacts that affect continue to affect physiological, mental, and behavioral health as an adolescent matures into adulthood (Crews et al., 2016) . Adolescents who use alcohol have been found to have higher incidence of depression severity and general anxiety disorder (Dyer et al., 2019; Schleider et al., 2019) . Factors protecting youth from substance use have been found to include availability of resou rces, community involvement, and social support; while self -esteem, refusal skills, personality, and mental health have been identified as factors that can increase risk of substance use (Garza et al., 2018) . A study examining the relationship between ethnocultural identity measures and substance use reinforced the importance of interventions with relevance to a youth's cultural and ethnic background. Interventions grounded in culture have promise to address substance use among adolescents in Hawai i such as the Ho'ouna Pono, developed with attention to the unique strengths and needs of Native Hawaiian students (Helm et al., 2019) . Trends / prevalence rates from Alcohol Use Indicators Any Current Alcohol Use in the Past 30 Days Grade Although rates of reported current use of (any) alcohol in the past 30 days were higher for the ATOD Survey compared to other national surveys, and Hawai i YRBS, there was an increase in alcohol use from 8th to 12th grade across all three surveys (Figure 16). High school students use alcohol at higher rates than middle school students, with 12th graders reporting the highest use in the past 30 days for alcohol. Current alcohol use in Hawai'i reported in the ATOD Student Survey among 12th grade students (40.1%) approximated the national Youth Risk B e h a v i o r S u r v e y ( U S Y R B S , 3 9 . 9 % ) b u t was consider ably higher than the rate reported by the state YRBS (26.8%). Alcohol use by 8 th graders was lower than older students, however 16.5% of middle school students reported drinking in the past 30 days on the 2019 - 2020 ATOD Survey . 16.526.540.1 Hawai'i & National: Current Alcohol Use in the Past 30 Days by Grade (%) ATOD Hawai'i 2019-2020 YRBS Hawai'i 2019 YRBS National 2019 MTF National 2019 Figure 16.

Race/Ethnicity Students who identified primarily as Native Hawaiian, two or more ethnicities including Native Hawaiian, or Hispanic / Latino reported current use of alcohol at elevated rates (3 4.4%, 34.7%, and 3 7.8%, respectively , in comparison to the overall state of 27.4%).

By grade , any lifetime use of alcohol was lowest among 8th graders (34.8%), followed by 10th graders (54%), and 12th graders having tried alcohol in their lifetime the most frequently (68.7%). By 12th grade, lifetime use of alcohol doubles from 8th grade lifetime use of alcohol. Early initiation of alcohol use (by age 13) was reported by 33.8% of 8th graders, 32. 2% of 10th graders, and 22.3% of 12th graders - the first use of alcohol occurs for many students by middle school and early high school. By gender , female students are more likely to begin use of alcohol (30.9%) and binge drink (8.4%) before age 13 than male students (27.9 and 5.9% respectively). Transgender and other gender minority students began early use of alcohol (45.9%) and early binge drinking (26.5%) at the highest rate , with also a higher rate of lifetime use of any alcohol (61.1%) and any binge drinking (44%) than their cisgender counter parts. By race/ethnicity, Native Hawaiian (including two or more mixed ethnicity with Native Hawaiian) (37.8%), and Hispanic/Latino (38.6%) students were the most likely to begin drinking alcohol by age 13 . Native Hawaiian students (12.5%) were also most likely to initiate early binge drinking by age 13. Other Asians (17.2%), Japanese (20%), and Other Pacific Islander Students (22.2%) were the least likely to begin early initiation of drinking alcohol. Tobacco Cigarettes & Vaping Consequences of Tobacco Cigarette & Vaping/E -Cigarette Use from the Literature The negative consequences of tobacco and nicotine product use range from physiological, developmental, and psychological effects at the individual level to broader social impacts. The physiological effects of cigarette smoking on the body's organs and syst ems is well- documented. In the respiratory system, damage is caused in the trachea and larynx, reducing lung capacity, increased risk of lung infection and symptoms such as coughing or wheezing, and permanent damage to the alveoli (U.S. Department of Healt h and Human Services, 2020) . In the circulatory system, cigarette smoking elevates blood pressure and heart rate, increases risk of stroke and heart attack due to blockages, less oxygen carried by the blood, damage to arterial lining, and can be a contribu ting factor to atherosclerosis (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020) . In the immune system, tobacco use is associated with higher susceptibility to infections such as pneumonia and influenza, more severe and longer- lasting illnesses, and low er levels of antioxidants in the blood (Briffa et al., 2021) . Tobacco smoke has also been linked to several diseases, including cancer, lung diseases (chronic bronchitis), heart disease, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis (Hurley et al., 2020; Winnall, Bellew, et al., 2021; Winnall, Hurley, et al., 2021) . Research on the effects of e- cigarettes and vaping devices is still emergent. Thus far, studies have indicated that vaping/ e-cigarettes can function as a \"gateway\" to tobacco cigarette s. Adolescent non -smokers that use e- cigarettes showed more willingness to smoke cigarettes compared to those that had never used any tobacco products (Wills et al., 2017) . E-cigarette use is also commonly misinterpreted as being a \"healthy\" choice, even 33 though e -cigarette vapor has been demonstrated to be independently associated with pulmonary effects such as asthma (Schweitzer et al., 2017; Wills et al., 2021) . Finally, widespread impacts of tobacco and nicotine product usage have been found. In the fam ily setting, e - cigarette usage has been found to be a risk factor for smoking onset using psychosocial factors including rebelliousness, parental support, and willingness to smoke (Wills et al., 2016) . With attention to ethnic and cultural differences, mu ltivariable logistic regression results suggest that Native Hawaiians and Filipinos were significantly more likely than other ethnic groups to report perceived improvements to their health and wellbeing due to e- cigarettes (Seto et al., 2016) . U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islander adolescents were fourfold more likely to use cigarette and smokeless tobacco than the U.S. average for middle school students. This disparity jumped to fivefold for e - cigarettes usage (Pokhrel et al., 2019) . Culturally responsive preve ntion programs may be needed to address disparities in indigenous and minority populations. Trends / prevalence rates from Tobacco and Vaping Use Indicators Any Current Use of Tobacco Cigarettes & Vapes/E- Cigarettes in the Past 30 Days Grade Current tobacco and vape use were highest among 12th graders among all surveys , although the Hawai i ATOD Survey and the Hawai i YRBS rates were lower than that of the national YRBS for 12th graders. 7.3 6.911.6 4.1 4.8 5.6 National: Current Cigarette & Vape Use in the Past 30 Days by Grade (%) ATOD Hawai'i Cigarette 2019-2020 YRBS Hawai'i Cigarette 2019 National Vape 2019 Figure 25.

Current moderate -heavy vape use from 8th grade to 12th grade increased by threefold. Gender By gender, rates of moderate -heavy use of both cigarettes and vape in the past 30 days were highest among T GGM (17.6%, 20.4%) students compared to their males 3.4% 12.2%). The moderate- heavy vape use among males and females was 3 -4 times that of moderate- heavy cigarette use, but for TGGM students moderate -heavy vape use was only slightly higher than that of their moderate- heavy cigarette use.

Overall, early initiation of cigarette use was present in 8th (11.8%) and 10th (11.6%) graders compared to 12th graders (8.1%), although lifetime cigarette use was higher in 12th graders (27.9%) than 10th (18.2%) or 8th (12.3%) graders. Transgender/other gender minority students were also more likely to have smoked cigarettes in their lifetime (42.2%) as well as have tried cigarettes early by 13 yea rs (30.8%) compared to their cisgender counterparts (females 18.3%, 8.8%; males 18.9%, 11.2% (25.2%), Hispanic/Latino (25.4%), and Other race/ethnicity (23.7%) were the most likely to have smok ed cigarettes in their lifetime. Students who primarily identified as Native Hawaiian (15.2%), Other Pacific Islanders (15.7%), and Other race/ethnicity (16.1%) were the most likely to smoke cigarettes by age 13 . In contrast, Japanese (3.3%), Other Asian ( 3.9%), and White (3.7%) students were the least likely to begin smoking by age 13. Like with other substances, as students get older in grade level , they are more likely to have tried vaping in their lifetime (8th 28.8%, 10th 46.4%, and 12th 58.4%). Early initiation of vape/e -cigarette use is greater at all grade levels (8th 27.5%, 10th 26%, 12th 11.2%) than for early use of tobacco cigarettes . By gender, overall, TGGM students were the most likely to vape in their lifetime (59.5%) and have t ried vape/e -cigarettes early by age 13 (36.8%), followed by female students (48.4%, 23.9% respectively), and with male students (40%, 19.6% respectively) being the least likely to vape. Among Native Hawaiian students (including those who identified primarily with two or more ethnicities with Native Hawaiian), 56.4% tried vaping in their lifetime, and 32.7% used vape/e -cigarettes by 13 years of age . Lifetime and early use of vape/e -cigarettes was also higher in Other Pacific Islander (50.5%, respective ly), Filipino (43.5%, Consequences of Marijuana Use from the Literature Marijuana has been consistently reported as one of the most used illicit substances in the U .S. every year. Use of marijuana products has negative consequences for youth. These consequences can range from developmental and physiological, to psychological and wider community impacts. Regular use of marijuana can cause long lasting respiratory problems , includ ing risk of bronchitis, airflow obstruction, and airway injury via edema, may result in dysregulated growth of bronchial epithelial cells, and marijuana smoke contain ing both carcinogens and co - carcinogens may lead to respiratory cancer (Tashkin et al., 2002) . Developmental consequences include long term decline in IQ , poor inhibition task accuracy, cued verbal memory, and psychomotor speed compared to non -users (Winward et al., 2014) . Longitudinal studies also suggest residual effects on cognitive functioning beyond those that are acute with regular marijuana use (Bourque & Potvin, 2021; Squeglia & Gray, 2016) , and concurrent use of alcohol with marijuana may have additiv e negative effects on neuropsychological functioning (Deniel et al., 2021; Lees et al., 2021) . In North American indigenous adolescents, a longitudinal study found interrelationships 38 of early marijuana use linked to early alcohol use, infrequent use of alc ohol related to abstaining from marijuana use, and concurrent marijuana -alcohol use with poorer outcomes in adulthood (Sittner et al., 2021) . Marijuana has frequently been linked to psychiatric symptoms and disorders such as schizophrenia, however, causality of the relationship is still debated (Arseneault et al., 2004; Burns, 2013) . The rates of marijuana use are about twice as high for those with schizophrenia than those within the general population , with self- reported heavy marijuana users at age 18 mu ch more likely than non -users to be diagnosed with schizophrenia later in life, however, this effect was not as significant when controlling for users who already had psychiatric diagnosis (Arseneault et al., 2004) . This suggests that marijuana use does no t cause schizophrenia or psychotic symptoms, but rather increases the likelihood of developing schizophrenia in individuals already predisposed to psychosis (Patel et al., 2020) and that marijuana use has an influential role in the development of psychiatric symptoms (Hanna et al., 2017) . Adolescence is a crucial life stage in which individuals transition from childhood to adulthood . Regular marijuana use in youth may have implications for continued frequent use into young adulthood, where outcomes may incl ude impaired social relationships and psychological functioning (Rhew et al., 2021) . Trends / prevalence rates from Marijuana Use Indicators Any Current Marijuana Use in the Past 30 Days Grade Rates of reported current use of (any) marijuana in the past 30 days were higher for the ATOD Survey compared to other national surveys, and Hawaii YRBS, especially among 12th graders. Overall, t here was an increase in marijuana use from 8th to 12th grade across all three surveys . High school students use marijuana at higher rates than middle school students, with 12th graders reporting the highest use in the past 30 days for marijuana. The ATOD Survey statewide sample showed 12th graders (31.1%) using marijuana in the past 30 days at almost threefold the rate of 8th graders (10.8%) . 10.820.031.1 National: Current Marijuana Use in the Past 30 by (%) Hawai'i Marijuana 2019 Figure 31.

Lifetime Marijuana Use and Early Initiation by Grade, Gender & Race/Ethnicity See Table 22 in the Appendix which summarizes the lifetime and early marijuana use, as well as current co -use of marijuana- alcohol together, by grade, gender, and race/ethnicity. By grade, 8th graders (15.5%) were the least likely to have used marijuana in their lifet ime. More than a third of 10th graders (34.3%) and over half of 12th graders (51.2%) have tried marijuana in their lifetime . Early initiation of marijuana use was present in all grades with 14.5% of 8th graders, 15.6% of 10th graders, and 13.8% of 12th graders reporting that they tried marijuana by age 13. Current co -use of marijuana -alcohol together increased by grade level , with 20.6% of 12th graders, 12.1% of 10th graders, and 6.5% of 8th graders using the two substances together. Moderate -heavy (6 or mo re times in the past 30 days) marijuana use alone and concurrent marijuana -use was higher for 12th graders (15.1%, 5.5% respectively) than for 10th graders (8.5%, 3.8% respectively) and 8th graders ( 4.5%, 2.2% respectively). Transgender and other gender minority students were the most likely to try marijuana at least once in their life (48.6%), compared their cisgender counterparts (females 35.9%, males 30.2%). TGGM students (33.7%) were also more than twice as likely to begin marijuana use by age 13 , in contrast to females (15.4%) males (13.2%).

Opioids, Other Prescription Drugs, and OTC Drugs Consequences of Prescription and Over -the-Counter Drug Misuse from the Literature Misuse of prescription drugs, particularly opioids, in the United States has been increasing to become a public health problem. Physiological consequences of opioid abuse include restlessness, vomiting, insomnia, among a myriad of other serious symptoms (Kosten & Baxter, 2019; Kosten & George, 2002; Shah & Huecker, 2021) . Psychological consequences include greater anxiety, irritability, and a powerful desire to use (Kosten & Baxter, 2019; Kosten & George, 2002) . Prescription opioid misuse has inc reased in the United States in the last few decades, and deaths due to drug overdose are largely attributed to opioids (Ford, 2019) . Furthermore, as a contributor to related poisoning and emergency department visits, adolescent misuse of both prescription and over -the-counter (OTC) drugs remains widespread and a growing concern (Abraham & Chmielinski, 2018; Bonar et al., 2020; Finkelste in McCabe et al., 2017; Schifano et al., 2021; Siste et al., 2019) . Anabolic steroid misuse, which also has health and developmental consequences among youth including associated mental health and other substance use problems, co ntinues to be a public health concern (AlShareef et al., 2021; Gestsdottir et al., 2021; Middleman & DuRant, 1996) . Trends / prevalence rates from OTC, Opioids, and Other Prescription Drug Use Indicators Any Current Opioid, Other Prescription Drug, or OTC Use in the Past 30 Days Grade By grade ( Figure 37), 10th graders from the Hawaii ATOD Survey reported current use of sedatives and other prescription drugs (3.4%), and in particular, over the counter (OTC) drugs (6.6%) more often than 8th (2.3%, 4.4% respectively) or 12th graders (2.7%, 3.9%). Steroid and opioid prescription drug use were lower in general across all grade levels and for the state compared to sedative and other prescription drug and OTC drug use . 43 Gender Current use of opioids (13.8%), sedatives and o ther prescription drugs (19.2%), OTC drugs (18.8%), and steroids (12.9%) was uniformly highest among Transgender and other gender minority students compared to their cisgender counterparts.

Note that due to low counts (cells with less than 10), data were suppressed in a number of cells for opioids and other drug categories.

Other Drugs Consequences of Other Illicit Drug Use from the Literature Illicit drug use in Hawai'i has been marked by higher prevalence of methamphetamine use than nationally (Linn, 2020) . The consequences of methamphetamine use are significant, affect ing the development of all youth, but especially affect ing the development of babies and neonates who have mothers who use meth amphetamine ; thus, resulting in poorer health outcomes, including sensory, motor and cognitive deficits (Li et al., 2021) .

Illicit use of other drugs continues to also be a concern among youth as polysubstance use may persist into adulthood (Merrin et al., 2018) , and incr easing resources are needed in emergency department and treatment systems to adequately address substance use and related psychiatric issues (Kiyokawa et al., 2021; Martinotti et al., 2021; Zuckermann et al., 2020) . Trends / prevalence rates from Other Illicit Drug Indicators Grade By grade, 12th graders from the Hawaii ATOD Survey reported the highest current use of cocaine and hallucinogens (2.5% and 2.8 % respectively), while 8th graders reported the highest current use of inhalants (3.4%) and methamphetamine (1.0%). Current use of other illicit drugs which included use of Rohypnol, MDMA, other synthetic drugs, GHB and ketamine, were similar across 8th, 10th, and 12th graders (1.6%, 1.5%, and 1.6% respectively). 8th 10th 12th Overall State Inhalants 3.4 2.5 1.0 2.3 Heroin 0.8 0.9 0.4 0.7 Cocaine 1.2 1.3 2.5 1.6 Methamphetamine 1.0 0.9 0.5 0.8 Hallucinogens 1.4 1.9 2.8 2.0 Other Illicit Drugs 1.6 1.5 1.6 1.50.01.02.03.04.0Current Substance Use (Past 30 Days) by Grade (%) Inhalants Heroin Cocaine Methamphetamine Hallucinogens Other Illicit Drugs Figure 40.

Access to alcohol, marijuana, tobacco/vape, and other drugs is also characterized by grade, gender, and primary race/ethnicity in the following tables. As students advance to higher grade levels, they are more likely than their 8th and 10th grade peers to also be giving money to someone to buy them alcohol (8th 2.0%, 10th 5.1%, 12th 15.8%), marijuana (8th (8th 10th 7.5%, 12th 11.9%), and other drugs (8th 0.9%, 10th 1.4%, 12th 2.0%). Female (F) and transgender/other gender minority (TGGM) students are also more likely than their male (M) counterparts to be given substances by someone . Also, TGGM students are more likely to be buying marijuana (F 0.4%, M 0.7%, TG GM 9%, TGGM 7. 4%) from a store . For open -ended comments in the category of \"Some Other Way\" for marijuana access, common responses included getting it from a dealer, growing it, or stealing it .

Important risk and protective that emerged from the modeling were also analyzed descriptiv ely, and were graphically represented as an overall state profile of the risk and protective factors ( Figure 46). Problem Substance Use Risk & Protective Factors Community Community 44.2% Encouragement 55.8 % Ease of access to substances 69.4% Positive social norms for youth not using alcohol 31.4 % Neighborhood use of substances School 19.8 % Neighborhood Crime/Drug selling 47.3% Climate/Enjoyment Peer Peer 42.3 % Close friends offer marijuana or alcohol 41.1% Friends enjoy school 37.8 % Peer exposure to marijuana or alcohol use Family 13.3 % Close friends approve of marijuana or alcohol 66.4% Talking to family about a problem Family 90.6 % Clear rules & consequences about 20.3% Exposure to parent alcohol use using alcohol & drugs 6.7% Relative marijuana use Individual 29.2% Live with someone with a substance use problem 86.0 % Disapproval of substance use Individual 73.9 % Academic achievement 21.8% Suspension or expulsion 19.9% Skipping class 43.3% Done something crazy 40.9% Depression Figure 46. State profile of percent of students endorsing emerging important risk and protective factors in the Social -ecological model for predicting problem substance use. Individual level (disapproval of substance use 86.0%, and academic achievement 73.9%) and family (clear rules and consequences abo ut using drugs 90.6%) were the most endorsed protective factors statewide . Risk factors 63 that were commonly endorsed were in the community (ease of access 55.8%), individual (done something crazy 43.3%, depressive symptoms 40.9%) and peer (peer exposure to marijuana/alcohol 37.8%, friends offer alcohol or marijuana 42.3%) domains . Additional Tables for Risk and Protective Factors from the Social- Ecological Model by Grade, Gender, and Race/Ethnicity are also available in the Appendix. The relationship of the modeling -informed important factors was also examined for problem substance use (CRAFFT) screen categories. Table 17 show s that protective factors were generally associated with greater negative screens while risk factors were associated with higher rates of screen positive and probable SUD . Table 17.

While the survey was not developed with a specific resilience framework in mind, many of the questions align with findings from previous work (Fergus & Zimmerman, 2005; Sanford Inspirations, 2017; Liebenberg et al., 2017; Wilcox et al., 2021) . The model maps adversity and resilience factors for substance use derived from constructs proposed in the literature based on face validity. Figure 47. Resilience model for any substance use based on theoretical constructs. Structural eq uation modeling was used to examine the relationships using software package R (R Core Team, 2013) applying the conceptual model. Statistically significant parameter estimates (beta weights) are displayed. The model indicates that higher levels of adversi ty reduce resilience. Community adversity was the largest contributor, followed by peer, family, and individual, respectively. The model also indicates the resilience significantly reduces the likelihood of any substance use. Validation of prosocial belief s was the largest contributor, followed by school climate, relationships, self -efficacy, and cultural connection, respectively. The fit statistics indicated good fit with RMSEA=0.05. Other indices failed to reach cutoffs of .95 for a good fit with CFI= 0.84; and TLI=0.82. Exploratory factor analyses suggest revising the model will improve the fit. Future efforts will explore this promising direction. 65 Chapter 7 Data Limitations and Gaps As with all studies, there are limitations that should be considered when examining the results of the 2019 -2020 Hawaii Student ATOD Survey . Participation & Sample bias The sample of the ATOD survey included only public schools, and not private or charte r schools. A small number of students were excluded from the sample if they were opted out by their parent or guardian, or chose not to participate in the survey. Students who were absent throughout the survey process (i.e., absent when opt -out forms were distributed or on the day of the survey) were not included . Since substance use is normally higher among non -participating students, absentee students, and dropouts, this study may underestimate substance use among Hawai'i's youth. To specifically address this higher risk group of youth, a parallel qualitative needs assessment was conducted that focused on young people who have lived experience with adolescent substance use treatment services in Hawai i. Youth participants were recruited based on their invo lvement in public sector systems including foster care, juvenile justice, homelessness, and mental health, which correspond to substance use disparities (Helm et al., 2021) . Overall Honesty The 2019 -2020 Hawai'i Student ATOD Survey was an online survey. According to results from the 2006 -2007 pilot study (Onoye et al., 2012) changing the sampling framework to a web -based system should have improve d the honesty with which students answer questions as well as increasing the response rate. Overall, 96.3% of students reported being very or mostly honest in their responses on the survey, however, students may have responded in ways that overreport or und erreport substance use and related factors. Making Comparisons Another potential issue is how comparable this study is to national surveys as not all survey items were written in the same way. This may pose a problem when comparing the current study to sim ilar national studies. Given the large gap in time and differing methodologies between this study and the prior Hawaii ATOD Surveys, findings from this study could not be directly compared to the results from the 200 7-2008 Hawai'i Student ATOD Survey. While the survey may be improved in capturing more current and relevant data, it only provides a cross - sectional perspective (i.e., provides a snapshot of what is happening at the time the student took the survey) and thus temporal or predictive relations hips cannot necessarily be established. COVID -19 and Missing Data The data were collected prior to the coronavirus pandemic related closure of public schools. Due to the interruption in data collection some data were not able to be collected. Statistical and community knowledge approaches were used to estimate missing data when possible. Modeling approaches using imputed data were not significantly better, therefore original models with missing data were used. 66 Strengths Despite these limitations, this stud y utilizes contemporary methods that are consistent with other state and national student surveys. Furthermore, this report provides the most comprehensive and current assessment of substance use, risk and protective factors, and treatment needs for youth in Hawai'i. Dissemination was the driver of the survey relational design, therefore we anticipate that the data are more likely to be utilized to inform policy and practice within schools and systems of care. 67 Chapter 8 Key Takeaways As an overview of key findings , the following summarize the highlights from the 2019 -2020 Hawai i ATOD Survey: Overall, about 11% of students screen ed for a probable substance use disorder, indicating treatment need, and an additional 14% f ell into the positive risk range for problem substance use. Treatment need increased by grade, more than doubling from middle school (8th grade 6.6%) to high school (12th grade 15%) Gender diverse students make up the smallest proportion of the state sample but show the highest risk for a probable substance use disorder and for substance use behavior in almost all categories, including tobacco cigarettes . Females are also higher in risk, compared to males. Adolescents most likely to have a probable substance use disorder primarily identified themselves as Other Pacific Islander (19.7%), Native Hawaiian (15.2%), Hispanic or Latino (16.2%), and of 2 or more ethnicities with Native Hawaiian (13.5%). Approximately 37% of students endorsed some level (mild, moderate, or severe) of mental heal th distress - and among those with severe distress, about one fourth are likely to have a problem with substance use. Screening for attention related disorders (Pediatric Symptom Chec klist, Attention subscale), youth with a positive screen (which indicates further assessment for attentional disorders) had a percentage (19.5%) of probable substance use disorder, about twice that of those with a negative screen (9.6%). Less than one third of students that screen in the probable SUD or positive risk categories are receiving any help, of which about three -fourths are receiving some type of help at school. The other 70 -80% that are likely to need treatment or some kind of prevention intervention did not get help even if they thought they should, or did not think that getting help applied to them . Vaping is the most commonly used (25.9% report current use) and most frequently used (13.8% report moderate -heavy use) among the substance use behaviors in the past 30 days. Current (20.3%) and moderate -heavy (9.3%) use of marijuana is also higher. Alcohol use in the past 30 days is high (27.3% current use), but binge behavior (13.9%) and more frequent use (moderate- heavy use 5.3%) in the past 30 days is much lower. Alcoh ol is the substance that most students try at a younger age, with an alarming peak distribution of first use at 8 years of age or younger for many youth, and another gradual peak around 13 -15 years of age. This period of adolescence is also a time when oth er first use of substances such as vaping and marijuana occurs. Initiation of binge drinking appears to peak around 15 years of age, perhaps as a result of increasing numbers of students that have already tried alcohol by 13 years old. Substance use categ ories such as binge drinking, moderate -heavy vape/e -cigarette use, and marijuana use were disproportionately higher for students who primarily iden tified as Native Hawaiian, two or more ethnicities with Native Hawaiian, Hispanic/Latino, and Other Pacific Islander. 68 The most common ways that students acquire alcohol, tobacco/e -cigarettes, and marijuana are when someone gave it to them, they gave someone money to buy it for them, while at school (tobacco/vape and marijuana), or took it (alcohol) from a family member. The most common places that students use alcohol, tobacco/e -cigarettes, and marijuana are at their or another person's home, or at a public place. Marijuana and vaping also are used while on school property . Substance use prevention education and public awareness message s reach a large majority, but not all, students in a variety of ways, including from family, at school, friends, television/music channels, social media, digital ads on their devices, and traditional printed media such as posters and signs. In a resilience model of risk and protective factors, community, peer, family, and individual factors were found to contribute to adversity, which reduces resilience to substance use. However, the model also indicates the resilience significantly reduces the likelihood of any substance use - community validation of prosocial beliefs was the largest contributor, followed by school climate, relationships, self- efficacy, and cultural connection . 69 Chapter 9 Recommendations Prevention and Treatment Overall, approximately more than one in ten students screened as having a probable substance use disorder . The rates of students in the probable SUD range were highest for transgender and other gender minority stu dents and 12th graders. The validated CRAFFT screening instrument was included in the ATOD Survey, which aligns with the DOE and ADAD adolescent treatment services. Results of the CRAFFT screen data indicated that only a small proportion of students who sc reened in the probable SUD range reported receiving any assistance (at school or outside of school) for substance use problems. This indicates a gap between adolescents in need of services and those who actually receive services. Additionally, given the si gnificant number of students who are at risk for SUD, there may be a greater demand for earlier intervention to adequately address prevention needs . Behavioral health screening and supports in schools and community settings continue to be needed, with gre ater integration of behavioral health services to address co -occurring mental health issues and substance use. Evidence -based approaches such as Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) should be implemented in school - and community -based settings, given the growing body of research associated with SBIRT that demonstrates overall improvements for substance use and increased student access to mental health support (for a brief review, refer to appendix in Helm et al., 2021) . Piloting an implementation of SBIRT in community regions with high rates of probable SUD in youth could inform plans to integrate SBIRT into the existing state system of care for substance use. School as a source of formal support for students dealing with substa nce use emerged as a strong theme from the in-depth interviews conducted for the qualitative youth needs assessment companion study to the Hawai i Student ATOD Survey (Helm et al., 2021) . Youth offered constructive suggestions for schools to better fulfill this critical role, including: (a) the expansion of extracurricular activities as a protective factor for students who were at greater risk of exposure to substance use at home and in their communities; (b) improved staff training to facilitate a shift from punitive to supportive attention, with a focus on recognizing student needs and sharing information on services and resources; and (c) destigmatizing help -seeking for substance use (Helm et al., 2021) . Disproportionate rates of treatment need and sub stance use behaviors suggest that transgender and other gender minority students are especially vulnerable and may need additional outreach and services to address substance use issues. ADAD is encouraged to expand upon the commendable leadership that it h as already shown in integrating evidence -based cultural approaches into prevention and treatment with the goal of reducing behavioral health disparities seen in specific ethnic and cultural populations. For example, ADAD's support for promising local programs such as Puni Ke Ola could be a model for other jurisdictions advocating for a holistic approach of \"culture as health\" (Helm & Davis, 2017) . Identifying r isk and protective factors via data- driven strategies used in this ATOD Survey and the qualitativ e needs assessment (Helm et al., 2021) are important for building on youth's resilience around substance use. P revention, 70 treatment and recovery, and other intervention programs can be informed by projects like this to help improve outcomes for reducing a dolescent substance use more effectively. These factors have potential implications among the broader stakeholders working in the system of care. As intended from the relational design of the project, we hope that school -based prevention and treatment providers may also benefit from hearing about youth substance use data from the Hawai i ATOD Survey and its qualitative companion study to inform and improve their practice. We are grateful to be a part of this k kou effort to embrace our youth and support their development to thrive. 71 Chapter 10 References Abraham, O., & Chmielinski, J. (2018).

The following tables include the 2007 -2008 ATOD Survey data only for the purposes of illustrating historical contextual information , and only after having been reanalyzed excluding the 6th grade sample from the originally report ed results. The 2007 -2008 ATOD Survey did not include Transgender and Other Gender Minority as a subgroup, nor did it analyze Hispanic/Latino as a separate race/ethnicity category. Therefore, the percentages reported for the reanalyzed 2007 -2008 ATOD Survey for gender and race/ethnicity may be overreported or underreported. For any historical prevalence data from the 2007 -2008 ATOD Survey, the reader is recommended to reference the appropriate data from the original report \"The Hawaii Student Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use Study: 2007 - 2008 Comprehensive Report\" on the Hawaii State Department of Health Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division Archive Reports webpage ( https://health.hawaii.gov/substance -abuse/submenu/archieve/ ). 92 Alcohol Table 19.
