Additionally, we have access to advanced laboratory, imaging, procedural, and motility testing. With these resources, we aim to provide excellent care to improve the quality of life in those with celiac disease and other small bowel disorders. What is Celiac Disease? Gluten is a term used to refer to proteins that can be found in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is a condition where the immune system of the body reacts against ingested gluten. This immune reaction leads to damage to the small intestine which in turn can lead to difficulty absorbing nutrients. Many organ systems outside of the intestinal tract can also be involved, and celiac disease is viewed as a systemic disorder that can present with many different signs and symptoms from infertility, abnormal liver tests, osteoporosis, to peripheral neuropathy. Some people with celiac disease are asymptomatic. Celiac disease develops at any age in those with a genetic predisposition. The environmental triggers for developing celiac disease are not known. Although there are several ongoing clinical trials on non-dietary therapy for celiac disease, the only current treatment is a gluten-free diet. Despite a strict gluten-free diet, many with celiac disease remain symptomatic. Determining the cause for these persistent symptoms often requires further evaluation and testing.
