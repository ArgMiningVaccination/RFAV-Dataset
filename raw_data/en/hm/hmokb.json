At Back to Basics Wellness, we strive to use the best of both. The emphasis is on full body health and includes allopathic, osteopathic and complimentary / alternative options. As a patient, you benefit from having more choices that you and your physician can use to improve your overall health. Dr. Jan is experienced in the treatment of thyroid and adrenal disorders, including Autoimmune Thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease). Through a thorough evaluation, medication, diet, and lifestyle changes, patients are educated to better manage their health, motivated to make the changes, and empowered with the knowledge to do so. The tools we use include discussing nutritional strategies, reviewing, and recommending supplements based on patient needs and goals. We can treat nutritional deficiencies through intravenous (IV) therapy for those who cannot absorb their nutrients through their gut or who need immune system support with high dose IV Vitamin C therapies. We also offer IV Chelation Therapies to improve blood flow to the heart or to remove heavy metals, like Lead, from the body. Dr. Jan has training and experience in the use of Essential Oils, Herbology, and Homeopathy which allows her to discuss these treatments, counsel patients on correct usage and make recommendations when to use them. We currently offer immune system therapies to help arthritis (LDI's) and allergies (LDA's). These therapies desensitize the immune and autoimmune response as appropriate to decrease the need for medications and improve quality of life. Another example of non-toxic and safer choices for individuals with extensive allergies, multiple chemical sensitivities, or arthritis. Do the Integrative treatments work for everyone? No. You are an individual with your own quirks. Patient experience with Integrative Medicine has been positive and can bring hope into lives and help individuals accomplish their desires to improve their health.
