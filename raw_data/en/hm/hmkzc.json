Summaries Of The News: [ Covid Is On The Rise, Yet Infections Are Likely Undercounted ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/covid-is-on-the-rise-yet-infections-are-likely-undercounted/) Other indicators, like wastewater surveillance, hint that the U.S. is in the midst of another covid surge. But a drop in lab-based testing is leaving a big data gap in the overall picture. And some public health experts question the usefulness of covid case counts at this point in the pandemic. [ NBC News: Incomplete Data Likely Masks A Rise In U.S. Covid Cases ](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/incomplete-data-likely-masks-rise-us-covid-cases-rcna23652) At first glance, U.S. Covid cases appear to have plateaued over the past two weeks, with a consistent average of around 30,000 cases per day, according to NBC News' tally. But disease experts say incomplete data likely masks an upward trend. In Washington, D.C., for example, several high-profile government figures recently tested positive, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, White House press secretary Jen Psaki and Attorney General Merrick Garland. (Bendix and Chow, 4/10) [ Bloomberg: Covid-19 Could Be Spreading Undetected In U.S. ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-10/covid-19-could-be-spreading-undetected-in-u-s) The rise of Covid cases in some regions of the U.S., just as testing efforts wane, has raised the specter that the next major wave of the virus may be difficult to detect. In fact, the country could be in the midst of a surge right now and we might not even know it. Testing and viral sequencing are critical to responding quickly to new outbreaks of Covid. And yet, as the country tries to move on from the pandemic, demand for lab-based testing has declined and federal funding priorities have shifted. The change has forced some testing centers to shutter while others have hiked up prices in response to the end of government-subsidized testing programs. People are increasingly relying on at-home rapid tests if they decide to test at all. But those results are rarely reported, giving public health officials little insight into how widespread the virus truly is. (Muller, 4/10) [ The Wall Street Journal: The BA.2 Variant Is Spreading.

Your kid stopped wearing a mask to school; you no longer wear one to work. After two years of Covid precautions, you finally feel normal again. Well, mostly.BA.2\u2014a subvariant of the Omicron variant that tore through the U.S. this winter\u2014is spreading. It's now the dominant variant throughout the country and has triggered recent surges in Europe. If you live somewhere where local statistics suggest cases are rising but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention map still shades your county low-risk green, it can be tough to figure out what to do.

Skeptics question his ability to navigate the toxic politics of Washington. Those who know Jha counter with stories like how he single-handedly short-circuited a Harvard faculty revolt. Dozens of faculty members had filed into a conference room in December 2018, prepared to vote they had no confidence in the dean of the public health school, until Jha talked them out of it. As Harvard's global health leader, Jha warned his colleagues that publicly airing their concerns would weaken confidence in the school, with consequences for them all. Instead, he took their complaints to dean Michelle Williams and attempted to quietly broker a solution, even though her removal could have opened a path for Jha to succeed her, said four people familiar with the situation.

The White House approach to keeping the president safe appears somewhat haphazard. [ The Washington Post: President Joe Biden's Pandemic Practices Vary As Covid Risks Grow ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/08/biden-pandemic-masks/) Most of the time, President Biden doesn't wear a mask, but occasionally he's spotted with one. Sometimes his events are in crowded indoor rooms, other times outdoors. And through it all over the past two weeks, people close to Biden \u2014 if not in \"close contact\" as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 are contracting covid as part of a wave washing over parts of official Washington.

Speaking on ABC's \"This Week,\" the president's chief medical adviser said, \"The protocols to protect the president are pretty strong.\" While allowing that an infection was certainly possible, Fauci added: \"The president is vaccinated. He is doubly boosted. He got his fourth shot of an mRNA.

But one of the most powerful tools against the coronavirus is one that experts believe is just starting to get the attention it deserves: ventilation. \"The challenge for organizations that improve air quality is that it's invisible,\" said Joseph Allen, director of the Healthy Buildings Program at the Harvard T.H.

This past week, experts began charting a path to a future that is less perfect - but more practical. It means building a vaccine that targets more than one strain of the virus. It would reduce severe disease and death, but not prevent every infection. If the design is changed, all vaccines will be updated.

Women who are normally disqualified from Medicaid because of an income cut-off but don't make enough to afford other insurance are granted special eligibility during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

This is especially true in the 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But when the Trump administration declared the coronavirus a public health emergency, people on Medicaid received continuous coverage, so they did not have to worry about re-enrolling or potentially losing their health insurance in the middle of the pandemic.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced a bill Friday that would mandate that the Biden administration release the FDA's long-stalled hearing aid regulation within 30 days.

As China battles its largest-ever Covid outbreak, the discourse swings between two extremes: The country must accept Covid Zero and sporadic, disruptive lockdowns; or it must live with the virus western-style \u2014 and endure all deaths that ensue. For Chinese authorities, the former may no longer work but the latter is unacceptable. But there's an alternative: China should look to what can be learned from its neighbor Japan.

Alas, COVID-19 Is Not Yet Done With Us. ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-editorial-covid-wave-resurgence-20220408-whe4v3f3trfkbcae7tjs2akvee-story.html) In recent days, Matthew Broderick has become infected with COVID-19. So has Sarah Jessica Parker. And Daniel Craig. Those star names all are appearing in Broadway shows at present and their cases are illuminating not just due to their celebrity but because they are working in rigorously tested environments where infections are detected fast and public disclosures made. (4/8) [ Stat: The 'Successful Failures' Of Apollo 13 And Covid-19 Vaccination ](https://www.statnews.com/2022/04/11/successful-failures-apollo-13-covid-19-vaccination/) Doomed from the start. That phrase neatly describes the Apollo 13 mission, which launched this day in 1970, and the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination effort in the U.S. Yet both can be seen as \"successful failures.\" When astronauts James Lovell, John \"Jack\" Swigert, and Fred Haise blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center, they were anticipating mankind's third trip to the surface of the moon. Two days into the mission, a defective oxygen tank exploded when they were some 200,000 miles away from Earth, imperiling their lives and making it impossible to complete their mission. Around-the-clock efforts by teams on the ground, imbued with NASA ingenuity, helped the astronauts return safely to Earth in what was nothing short of a miracle. \"Our mission was a failure,\" Lovell wrote later, \"but I like to think it was a successful failure.\" (Christopher M.

The law provides people government subsidies for health insurance plans, but only if their employers do not offer them affordable health coverage. The law deems an employer-sponsored plan unaffordable if premiums would top about 10 percent of an employee's household income. So, if workers would have to pay sky-high premiums for their employer-sponsored plan, they could always seek coverage on the Obamacare marketplaces and receive assistance from government subsidies.

But there I was, a few weeks back, sobbing in the exam room.As a new resident of Fort Myers, Florida, I was trying to establish a relationship with a local primary care physician. From the start, the doctor's focus was her computer, not me. She stared at a screen, while I stared off into space (Christine Bechtel, 4/10) [ The Boston Globe: Future Of Health Care Shouldn't Be A Battle Of Behemoths ](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/04/11/opinion/future-health-care-shouldnt-be-battle-behemoths/) Mass General Brigham didn't become the medical behemoth it is today by not knowing the first rule of health care poker \u2014 know when to fold 'em. Faced with a wall of opposition to its proposed three new suburban outpatient surgical centers \u2014 not the least of which included a critical staff report by the Department of Public Health \u2014 the organization formerly known as Partners HeathCare cut its losses. In the end, MGB settled for partial wins on expansion plans on the main Mass General campus and at its Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital.

[ NBC News: Anxiety And Other Mental Health Issues Cancel Culture Is Breeding ](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/anxiety-mental-health-cancel-culture-rcna23111) Effective talk therapy is premised on complete privacy and trust between the patient and therapist. These are the foundations for the open, candid and difficult conversations necessary to get to the root of personal issues. But during many of my recent sessions, it's felt as if there were more than two of us in the room. The overreach of cancel culture from across the spectrum is making its way into therapy offices, and that is worrisome for clinicians and patients alike.

Whitmer And Other Democratic Governors Look To Protect Abortion Rights After Roe ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/04/10/whitmer-michigan-abortion-rights-state-constitution/) Michigan, though one of the most tightly fought swing states in the country, is also a place where support for access to abortion is strong. Nearly 70 percent of voters in one recent poll expressed support for the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision establishing abortion as a constitutional right. However, if the court does what many people expect it to do in an upcoming Mississippi case and overturns Roe, the law governing abortion in Michigan will revert to one of the most extreme in the country: a 1931 measure, unenforceable after Roe but still on the books, that makes it a felony to provide the procedure, except where necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman. (Karen Tumulty, 4/10) [ The New York Times: To Be Pro-Choice, You Must Have The Privilege Of Having Choices ](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/opinion/abortion-black-brown-women.html) Systemic racism is built into every facet of our society, including sexual and reproductive health. In 1973 the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade affirmed the constitutional right to abortion, barring states from banning abortion before the point of fetal viability. But too many states, especially in the South, interpreted and applied the decision as strictly as they could get away with, disproportionately affecting women of color.

This year's theme - \"Public Health is Where You Are\" - demonstrates that where we live impacts our communities' health.

The \"unclear relationship between health care and law enforcement, is impacting the ability of some to feel safe seeking care,'' Dr. Daniel Hoody wrote in the newsletter. The medical center will also end a \"medical instruction\" contract with the Minneapolis police. In an interview with an editorial writer, CEO Jennifer DeCubellis underscored the need for the medical center to unambiguously be a place of healing.

The most recent reminder of this truism comes from studies in Health Affairs and JAMA Network that have drawn attention to the potential for racial and ethnic bias in physician documentation.

We believe it made the wrong choice. The agency, which regulates the public insurance programs that collectively serve about 135 million Americans, decided it will cover the cost of Aduhelm only for the tiny subset of people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease who choose to enroll in CMS-approved clinical trials of the drug.
