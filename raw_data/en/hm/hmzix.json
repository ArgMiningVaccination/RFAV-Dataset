We predict ed the vaccine efficacy against both 28 ancestral and variants , using previously reported correlates of protection and cross - 29 reactivity . We also reviewed and compa red seroconversion to nAbs, T-cell responses and 30 safety profiles between fractional and standard dose groups. 31 Results: We found that dose fractionati on of mRNA and protein subunit vaccines could 32 induce SARS -CoV-2 specific nAbs and T -cells that confer a reasonable level of protection 33 (i.e., vaccine efficacy > 50%) against ancestral strains and variants up to Omicron . Safety 34 profiles of fractional doses were non -inferior to the standard dose. 35 Conclusion: Dose fractionation of mRNA and protein subunit vaccines may be safe and 36 effective. 37 3 Introduction 38 Three years into the pandemic, COVID -19 continue s to threaten global health with emerging 39 variants. While vaccinations are effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths 1,2, there 40 has been unequal distribution of vaccinations across the globe. Despite that the current 41 vaccine supply would cover most of the global population, a portion of the supply were 42 prioritized for the fourth or fifth dose in high income countries, while only 1 5.7% of people 43 in low er income countries had received at least one vaccine dose as of 16 May 2022 3. Dose 44 fractionation of vaccines has been previously recommended to ease global supply shortage 45 and accelerate vaccine coverage in low -income countries , where a larger proportion of the 46 population could have access to vaccination while each individual would receive a lower 47 vaccine dose 4,5. However, uncertainties and concerns about the vaccine efficacy using 48 fractional doses against SARS -CoV-2 ancestral strains and emerging variants of concern 49 (VoCs) 6-8, and the potential difference s between vaccine platforms , hindered the 50 endorsement for dose fractionation of COVID -19 vaccine s 9,10. Nevertheless, a half-dose of 51 the original Moderna vaccine has been recommended for the booster dose for adults who 52 are not moderately and severely immunocompromised 11. 53 54 Here, we conducted a sy stematic review and meta -analysis of phase I/II trials that reported 55 dose -finding results of immunogenicity and safety profiles for COVID -19 vaccines (detailed 56 search terms in Table S1 ). We estimated the pooled dose -response relationship of 57 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the ancestral strain, which were then used to predict 58 the potential VE of fractional doses against infections of the ancestral strain and VoCs using 59 a hypothesized relation between nAbs and protection 12,13 . We also reviewed the 60 differences in seroconversion of nAbs, T-cell mediated immune responses and safety profile 61 4 between fractional and standard dose (i.e., doses used for final products or phase III trials) 62 groups , to further assess the differences in immunogenicity and safety after receiving 63 fractional and standar d doses . 64 65 Methods 66 Search strategy and study selection 67 We searched peer -reviewed publications on clinical trials of SARS -CoV-2 vaccines in PubMed 68 on 9 December 2021. We searched with the following terms: (SARS -CoV-2 OR COVID -19) 69 AND (vaccine AND dose) AND (antibod* OR immun*) (Table S1). We included dose - 70 escalation studies that reported safety, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs, which were measured 71 by PRNT 50 and/or sVNT), and/or T -cell mediated immunity among healthy individuals 72 received SRAS -CoV-2 vaccines (Tables S2-4) . We excluded 1) studies did not report 73 immunological response or only reported binding antibody; 2) studies without dose - 74 escalation; 3) studies on non -human hosts; 4) studies on participants with specific health 75 conditions (e.g., cancer, organ transplantation) or pregnancy; 5) studies specifically designed 76 for hybrid immunity (i.e., natural infection or heterogenous vaccinations); and 6) review s or 77 commentaries (Figure S1). We assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane 78 Risk o f Bias tool 2.0 for randomized trials 14 (Figure S2). 79 80 Data extraction and processing 81 Two reviewers (BY and XH) independently screened the titles and full text s of articles 82 according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. For each included study, we extracted 83 relevant information of the vaccines and participants onto a standardized form , which 84 5 includes vaccine name, manufacture, platform, dose fraction, vaccination and sampling 85 schedule, ag e group, and sizes of vaccinated subjects. Dose fraction ( ,) was defined as the 86 ratio of each examined dose group ( ,) and the standard dose ( ,, defined as the dose 87 selected for the approved vaccine product or phase III trials) for eac h study ( ): 88 ,=, , (1) 89 Differences in seroconversion of neutralizing antibodies after fractional and standard d ose 90 We compared the seroconversion proportion to nAbs against ancestral strains after 91 receiving fractional doses compared with the standard dose group , where seroconversion 92 was predefined by each study as at least four -fold increase in nAbs and/or changing from 93 negative to positive after vaccinations (details about definitions for positive threshold and 94 seroco nversion were shown in Table S3). We chose to estimate the pooled risks ratio of 95 seroconversion over the pooled proportion of seroconversion, to minimize the impacts of 96 measurement variations between laboratories. Sample size and the number of 97 seroconverte d participants were extracted for each dose group, which were then used to 98 estimate the pooled log risk ratio of seroconversion between fractional and standard dose 99 group using random effects (RE) model, stratified by vaccine type. We fitted mi xed effects 100 meta -regressions to assess the effects of vaccine platform and dose fracti ons on 101 seroconversion, after accounting for age group and assay methods. We als o repeated the 102 above analysis for higher dose group, which results can be found in our data repo sitory. 103 104 6 Dose -response relationship of neutralizing antibodies 105 For each study , we extracted the mean ( ,) and standard deviations ( ,) of nAbs titers in 106 different dose groups ; if not reported, we estimated , and , from 1) individual da ta 107 points , or 2) median, interquartile (IQR) and sample sizes15. We then standardized the 108 vaccine -induced nAbs level for 109 each study: 110 ,=, , (2) We summarized standardized nAbs among different dose groups (i.e., fractional , standard, 111 and high er dose groups) at different time points ( i.e., days after 1 or 2 doses ). To quantify 112 the non-linear dose -response relationship of vaccination and the standardized nAbs ( ,), 113 we fitted a generalized additive model (GAM ; Table S5) that accounted for the vaccine 114 platform ( ), vaccine schedule (i.e., total dosages and days after full vaccination ,), age 115 group ( = children, adult, or elderly) and antigen used for neutralizing assay ( = live or 116 pseudo virus): 117 log2,=0+ ,+ log2,++,+ ,+, (3) With estimates from equation 3, we predicted the standardized nAbs (assuming me asured 118 by live virus and in adults; same for the following) against SARS -CoV-2 ancestral strain 14 119 days after fully vaccinated (i.e., 1 dose for vector and 2 for the rest) with fractional doses 120 (,) for different vaccine platforms. We validated our model predictions and raw data and 121 performed ten -fold cross -validation (Figure S3 and Table S 6). 122 123 7 Vaccine efficacy predicted from neutralizing antibodies 124 We applied the established CoP protection of standardized nAbs 12,13 to predict the dose - 125 fractioning vaccine efficacy ( ) against symptomatic infection s of SARS -CoV-2 ancestral 126 strain for different vaccine platform ( ): 127 ,,=1 1 +log10, 50, (4) We obtained the log -transformed 50% protective efficacy ( log1050,) and steepness 128 parameter for both symptomatic and severe infection from the previous study 12. , is 129 the standardized nAbs at 14 days aft er fully vaccinated of fractional doses ( ,) for each 130 vaccine platform ( ), which was estimated from equation 3 with coefficients shown in Table 131 S5. 132 133 We used previously reported 6,13 fold of reduction ( ; Table S7) in nAbs to estimate the 134 level of standardized nAbs ( ,) against the variant , which was then applied to equation 135 4 to predict the vaccine efficacy of dose fractioning against infections of SARS -CoV-2 variant 136 of concerns (VoCs). To validate our predicted vaccine efficacy against VoCs (Supplementary 137 Figure 9), we compared the predicted vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infections after 138 standard dose and obs ervations (Table S8) reported previously by Pearson correlation. 139 Standard doses were used for comparison since there were no empirical data rega rding half - 140 dose. 141 142 T-cell responses 143 Since assays and measurements used for T -cell mediated responses vary across studies, we 144 reviewed if T -cell responses elicited by dose -fractioning vaccines 1) would be higher than 145 8 that at pre -vaccination level and 2) would be lower than that elicited by the standard dos e 146 vaccine within the same study. Briefly, we extracted mean ( ,,; log -transformed if 147 originally measured in log -scale ; same for SE ), standard error ( SE, ,,) and sample size ( ) 148 of specific measurement for T -cell responses for each dose group or reference group (i.e., 149 pre-vaccination or post stan dard dose vaccination) in study . Specific measurement ( ) 150 includes T -cell types (i.e., CD4+ or CD8+) and/or cytokines for T helper type 1 ( Th1, including 151 interferon - (IFN- ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF - ) and Interleukin -2 (IL -2)) and T helper 152 type 2 (Th2, including IL -4, IL-5, IL-13). If mean and SE were not reported, we estimated 153 these metrics from individual original data points or median, IQR and sample sizes 15. We 154 determined the statistical significance of difference in (log-)means ( ,,) assuming it 155 follows a normal distribution. 156 ,,= ,, ,, (5) ,,= ,,2 + ,,2 (6) 157 Safety 158 We compared the safety profiles after receiving fractional dose compared with the standard 159 dose group. We extracted the sample size and the number of adverse events (AEs, i.e., 160 solicited local and/or systemic events, unsolicited events, and any AEs) for each dose group . 161 Individual manifestations within each AE ca tegory were extracted and assessed. We 162 estimated the pooled log risk ratio of experiencing AEs between fractional and standard 163 dose group using RE model and stratifying by specific AE and vaccine platform . We 164 calculated the I2 to measure the heterogeneity of the included estimates. We also repeated 165 the above analysis for higher dose group, which results can be found in our da ta repository. 166 9 167 Results 168 In total 1,733 records were returned from PubMed search with 44 duplicates. After titer and 169 abstract screening, 136 records were eligible for full -text screen (Figure S1). Thirty -eight 170 studies were included in the analyses 16-53, among which inactivated vaccines (29%, n = 11) 171 were studied the most, followed by protein subunit ( \"subunit\" hereafter; 26%, n = 10), 172 mRNA 9), non -replicating viral vector ( \"vector\" hereafter; 13%, n = 5) and others 173 (Figure S1 and Table S2). We found overall low risks of bias of the included studies, expect 174 that seven adopted the non -randomized, and non-double -blinded design (Figure S2) 175 16,26,27,32,37,39,53. 176 177 Seroconversion of neutralizing antibodies after fractional doses 178 We estimated the pooled risk ratio (RR) of the seroconversion against ancestral strains 179 among individuals who completed fractional and standard dose from 14 studies of 9 180 vaccines (Figure 1). The probability of seroconversion to ancestral strains was 2.1% (95% 181 confidence interval (CI) 0. 4% to 3. 6%; 2= 52.0%, P-value < 0.01 ) lower among individuals 182 with fractional dose s compared to standard doses within the same trial . However, we found 183 no association between dose fraction ation (1.4%, 95% CI , -20.4% to 29.3% per fold increase 184 in dose) and seroconversion proportions between lower and standard dose gr oups after 185 accounting for vaccine platform , age group and assay methods (i.e., live or pseudo virus ) 186 (Table S9). 187 188 10 Dose -relationship of neutralizing antibodies and predicted v accine efficacy 189 Twenty -four studies reported nAbs against live (n = 20) and/or pseudo (n = 7) ancestra l 190 viruses from both post -vaccination and convalescent sera ( Figures S4-6 and Table S3). We 191 estimated that prime with one half-dose would elicit less than 10% of nAbs in convalescent 192 sera, while prime -boost with two half-doses elicit ed higher nAbs than a single standard dose 193 across all platforms (Figure 2A and Figure s S3-7 ). 194 195 We estimated that t wo half -dose mRNA vaccines wou ld elicit 2. 6 (95% CI, 2. 1 to 3. 3, 196 measured on day 14 ) fold of the nAbs against the ancestral strain in convalescent sera 197 (Figure 2A), which is expected to prevent 9 7% (95% CI, 95% to 97%) of symptomatic 198 infections of the ancestral strains, respectively (Figure 2B). Whereas two half-dose 199 inactivated vaccines would elicit 0.28 (95% IC 0.20 to 0.37) -fold of nAbs against the 200 ancestral strains in CI , 92% to 96%) efficacy against symptomatic and severe infections of the ancestral 202 strains, respectively. Overall , our predictions suggested that the reduction in vaccine 203 efficacy was smaller than dose frac tionation across all vaccine platforms (Figure 2C); half- 204 dose s may provide more than half of protection efficacy of standard dose s. 205 206 Further incorporating the reported fold reduction in of vaccine -induced nAbs against VoCs 207 (Table S7)6,13, we projected that two half -dose mRNA vaccines would confer the highest 208 efficacy against symptomatic infections of VoCs (94%, 95% CI, 92% 4% to 70% against Beta, 85%, 79 % to 8 9% against Gamma, 83%, 7 8% to 87% against 210 Delta and 32%, 6% to 40% against Omicron), followed by subunit , vector and inactivated 211 vaccines (Figure 3 and Figure S8). Our predicted efficacy against symptomatic infections of 212 11 VoCs for standard dose highly correlated (Pearson correlation 0.7 05, p-value < 0.01; Figure 213 S9) with empirical data 54-64, while we were not able to validate predictions for fractional 214 doses due to lack of data. Results from ten -fold validations further supported our model 215 fitting (Table S 6). 216 217 T-cell responses after fractional doses 218 We first reviewed whether T-cell mediated immune responses elicited by dose fractioning 219 vaccines would be higher than pre -vaccination level . All 7 studies of 5 vaccines reported 220 significant increase in SARS -CoV-2 specific CD4+/CD8+ or CD4+ T helper type 1 (Th1) 221 responses after vaccinat ed with fractional dose s compared to pre -vaccination (Figure 4A), 222 which were all biased to Th1 cells . 223 224 We then reviewed whether T-cell responses would be lower than that elicited by the 225 standard dose vaccine. Three vaccines (BNT162b130,37, MVC -COV190126 and Sf 9 cells31) 226 reported that dose fractionation elicited similar level of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T -cells compared 227 to standard dose (Figure 4B). Quarter -dose of mRNA -1273 16,27 was reported to induce 228 significantly lower CD4+ Th1 cells compared to standard dose, while half -dose of BBV152 229 were reported to induce significantly higher Th1 cytokines in one of two trials. We also 230 compared the cellular re sponses between standard and higher dose groups and found no 231 evidence for dose -dependent relationship for 7 out of 9 vaccines (Figure S10). 232 233 12 Safety profiles after fractional doses 234 We reviewed the safety profile for 34 studies and found that, compared to standard dose 235 group, people in the fractional dose groups tended to experience adverse events at similar 236 or lower frequen cy (Figure s 11-16). Particularly , the risk of experiencing solicited, and 237 unsolicited adverse events were 9.5% (95% CI, 3.9% to 1 4.8 %) and 24 .4% (3.9% to 41 .1%) 238 lower in individuals who received factional dose of mRNA vaccines compared to standard 239 dose s (Figure s 14-15). O ne inactivated (BBIBP -CorV in children 46) and two subunit (NVX - 240 CoV2373 and Livzon in adults 22,38) vaccines reported higher risk of solicited systemic 241 reactions in groups that received lower dose than the standard dose. 242 243 Discussion 244 Our findings suggested that vaccine -induce d nAbs varied substantially across dose fractions , 245 number of dosages , and vacc ine platforms. For vaccine platforms (e.g., mRNA and subunit ) 246 which standard doses could elicit higher nAbs levels than convalescent sera, fractionation of 247 prime -boost dose s could induce robust nAbs against the ancestral strains and similar 248 seroconversion proportion with standard doses . nAbs induce d by fractional vaccines of 249 mRNA and subunit were predicted to confer 65% efficacy against symptomatic infections 250 of SARS -CoV-2 variants, except for Beta and Omicron. Fractionation of vaccine doses 251 seemed to be safe and induce robust Th1 biased T -cell responses that were similar to 252 standard doses except for mRNA -1273. 253 254 We found that dose fractionation of COVID -19 vaccine s would induce , though lower than 255 standard doses , detective nAbs against ancestral strains . Based on previously established 256 CoP 12,13,65, these nAbs may confer reasonable prote ction (i.e., > 50%) against symptomatic 257 13 infections of ancestral strains, but not the subsequent VoCs, especially Omicron. Previous 258 modelling study suggested that dose fractionation could be a cost -effective strategy in low - 259 income countries , if vaccination could confer at least 50% of protection against symptomatic 260 infections of variants with low or moderate transmissibility (i.e., basic repro duction number 261 0 < 5) 66. Given these findings, our results of nAbs and vaccine efficacy predictions 262 suggested that dose fractionation could have been cost-effective strategy to control the 263 emergence of some early VoCs (e.g., Alpha an d Delta), but not for the currently circulating 264 Omicron given the significant immunity breakthrough 6,7 and higher transmissibility 67. 265 266 While there is no established correlate of protection against severe COVID, we found that 267 fractional doses of most studied vaccines could induce detective and l ikely robust T -cell 268 responses, which may contribute to protection against severe outcomes given that SARS - 269 CoV-2 specific T -cells could broadl y cross -react to a range of VoCs (including Omicron) and 270 were associated with better outcomes 68,69. Therefore, dose fractionation of COVID -19 271 vaccines might still be able to avert a considerable number of hospitalizations and deaths , 272 even with the emergence of new variants with higher rates of breakthrough infections . 273 274 We were not able to assess the durability of the immune respo nses elicited by fractional 275 doses of COVID -19 vaccines, as most trials reported limited follow up that was typically just 276 one month after vaccination . Therefore, our efficacy estimates may only be indicative for 277 short -term protection . Waning SARS -CoV-2 specific aAbs , T-cells and vaccine efficacy 278 (against both ancestral and VoCs) may be expected, as suggested by evidenc e from 279 individuals receiving standard doses after 6 months 7,70 -72. For standard doses, both 280 14 homogeneous and heterogenous boosters could substantially increase nAbs and vaccine 281 efficacy against VoCs 8, while such data were lack ing for fractional doses. 282 283 To minimize the impacts of measurement variations between laboratories, we compared 284 the differences in seroconversion of nAbs and T -cell responses within each trial and 285 quantified the dose -relationship using nAbs that were standardized to convalescent sera. 286 Calibration to recommende d international standard may further reduce the between 287 laboratory variations, which was, however, not reported by the included t rials. 288 289 We did not look at the nAbs induce d by individual vaccine manufacture rs due to limited 290 data , while we found consistent seroconversion proportion and dose -relationship within 291 platform (Figure s 3-7) . Nevertheless, disparities in nAbs levels and durability were reported 292 for individual vaccines from the same platform (e.g., mRNA -1273 vs. BNT162b1 vaccines 9). 293 294 Our study only focused on the immunogenicity and safety and the projected efficacy of dose 295 fractionation of COVID -19 vaccines , and therefore findings should be interpreted within this 296 scope . Endorsement of dose fractionation of vaccines by regulatory agencies would likely 297 need stronger efficacy data, and other considerations would include the evolving supply 298 situation, logist ics restr ictions , and vaccine communications. 299 300 To summar ise, fractionation of vaccine doses, especially mRNA and protein subunit 301 vaccines, are safe and would induce antibody and T -cell responses that likely confer a 302 reasonable level of protection against severe infections of SARS -CoV-2 ancestral and VoCs 303 up to Omicron . The use of vaccines with lower antigen content earlier in the pandemic 304 15 might have been an efficient approach to save even more lives, while furth er clinical 305 investigation of fractional booster doses would certainly be worthwhile . 306 307 308 Data availability 309 All data were collected from publicly available literatures, with detailed description in the 310 Methods and Supplementary Tables .
