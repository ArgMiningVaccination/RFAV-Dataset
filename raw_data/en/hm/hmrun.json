In this circumstance, it is evident that the toxicological profile of each component of the nanomedicine (the nanoparticulate carrier and the carried drug) does not necessarily reflect the toxicity of the resulting nanodrug. Indeed, a drug may significantly change its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile when attached to or can be used with a particulate carrier. In addition, nanoparticulate drugs are abundantly taken up by phagocytes, leading to an increased local concentration of the drug and of the consequent toxicity. At present, and also in the case of 'intelligent' nanodrugs that preferentially target a particular organ or tissue (e.g., the brain), most of the NPs, before being excreted through feces and urine, end up trapped in the RES, spleen, liver and kidney, with a risk of significant toxic effects in these sites (see for example[ [43](javascript:void(0);), [44](javascript:void(0);)]).
