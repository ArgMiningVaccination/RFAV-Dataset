This report represents the culmination of an enormous effort by hundreds of individuals representing a broad range of backgrounds and interests. This report and the reports of the CDEAC task forcesrepresent a comprehensive and balanced look at transmission, energy efficiency and clean energyresources. These documents represent the best thinking of some of the most accomplished expertsacross an array of issues. The strength of the CDEAC report is the recommendations for consideration by the Governors. We have organized the recommendations into those that can be considered by individual states, thosethat suggest opportunities for action on a regional level, and those that offer the potential for influencing national policy. As requested by your charge to the CDEAC, the recommendations stressnon-mandatory, incentive-based approaches. The CDEAC believes that the suite of recommendationsis worthy of consideration and adoption by the Western Governors where appropriate. The CDEAC believes this report offers the Western Governors a host of viable options for increasing the amount of energy efficiency and the construction of clean energy facilities in the West. It alsooffers real solutions for the long term safety and reliability of the transmission grid. The members of the CDEAC and its task forces wish to thank the Western Governors for the opportunity to have worked on this project of great importance to the West. Through the visionand leadership of the Western Governors, the West can achieve a reliable, secure and affordableenergy future. William J.

This event broughttogether more than 700 participants to discuss a broadrange of energy issues. Just two months later, the Governorslaunched the Clean and Diversified Energy Initiative with theadoption of a resolution that established three importantgoals for the West: Develop an additional 30,000 megawatts of clean energyby 2015 from both traditional and renewable sources; Achieve a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020; and Ensure a reliable and secure transmission grid for thenext 25 years. The Clean and Diversified Energy Advisory Committee (CDEAC) was commissioned by the Western Governors toidentify technically and financially viable policy mechanisms,stressing non-mandatory, incentive-based approaches, tomeet the goals established in the Governors' resolution. TheCDEAC was to be guided by the Western Governors' Enlibraprinciples, a doctrine created to guide natural resource andenvironmental policy development and decision-making in the West. In developing these recommendations, the CDEAC was required to: Examine the deliverability and adequacy of energy resources, including an assessment of promising newresources and technologies; Examine the obstacles to both intrastate and interstatetransmission siting and construction in order to accessclean energy resources; Consider price, reliability, and the mitigation of environ-mental impacts of all recommendations; Develop energy efficiency and conservation recommen-dations that take into account all types of energy used infacilities, not just electricity; and Address both technical and policy issues. At its first meeting in San Francisco, the CDEAC estab- lished task forces to assess resource potential and costs andto develop policy recommendations to meet the Governors'goals. Task forces that submitted reports were: AdvancedCoal, Biomass, Energy Efficiency, Geothermal, Solar,Transmission, and Wind. These task forces comprised someof the foremost technical experts in each of their fields. Thetask forces worked in cooperation with a quantitative working group to provide consistent economic data acrossthe reports. The task forces developed their reports through a series of meetings and conference calls. The CDEAC held meet-ings throughout the drafting of the task force reports,providing guidance when necessary. Draft reports fromeach of the task forces were posted for a public commentperiod of 30 days in order to identify any issues that had notbeen addressed. The public comments were reviewed byeach of the task forces and incorporated into the reports, asappropriate, prior to their publication. Final reports fromeach of the task forces were published throughout the earlymonths of 2006 and presented to the CDEAC. Additional proposals were submitted to the CDEAC as white papers in order to identify clean energy resources thatwent beyond the scope of the task forces chartered by theCDEAC. Combined heat and power (CHP) was considered as a potential attribute in a number of areas, and the CDEAC reviewed a white paper on this subject. Additionally, the CDEAC reviewed a white paper on ocean- and hydro-power. A report on advanced natural gas was received too late for the CDEAC to formally consider. Based on the reports and white papers it reviewed, the CDEAC produced a consolidated suite of recommendationsfor Western Governors to consider at their 2006 AnnualMeeting in Sedona, Arizona. A strong, overarching theme ofall the reports is the need for stable, long-term policies atboth the federal and state levels to achieve the stated objec-tives. This report represents the work of the CDEAC andmore than 250 stakeholders from an encompassing array of interests.1INTRODUCTION Clean Energy, a Strong Economy and a HealthyEnvironment The West is the fastest growing region of the country, and our ability to provideenergy must keep pace with an everexpanding population. However, energyshortages and price spikes have becomean increasing part of the global energypicture. While data from the EnergyInformation Administration (EIA) showsoverall consumption of natural gas hasremained relatively flat over the last several years, reliance on natural gas as afuel source for electricity production hasincreased dramatically. In addition, natu-ral gas has recently tripled in price, andanalysts believe higher natural gas priceswill be a fixture well in the future. There is broad agreement that the Western U.S. must act now to ensure itwill have a diverse supply of secure, envi-ronmentally responsible and affordableenergy well in the future. By acting now,we will be able to continue our economicprogress, protect our outstanding qualityof life and harness our abundant domestic energy resources. While future energy demand is dependent on many factors, it is certainthat the West will require more capacityin 2015. An examination of utility integrated resource plans and staterequirements for renewable portfoliostandards \u2014 without accounting for allthe potential gains in energy efficiency\u2014 shows nameplate capacity mayincrease from 319,500 megawatts in 2004to 363,000 megawatts in 2015 and to 400,000 megawatts in2020. The increase over the next 15 years could be as highas 80,000 megawatts. The magnitude of projected increasesunderscores the need to simulta neously pursue aggressive implementation of energy effic iency measures and to devel- op cleaner, more efficient energy generation. Historically, the West has relied heavily upon natural gas, coal and hydropower to meet its energy needs. In thefuture, these generating sources will continue to play anintegral role. Electricity demand in the future is dependent upon our ability to use energy more efficiently. In its Annual EnergyOutlook for 2006, the EIA stated: The energy efficiency of new household appliances plays a large role in determining the type and amount ofenergy used in the residential sector. As a result of stockturnover and purchases of more efficient equipment, theamount of energy used by residential consumers on a perhousehold basis has fallen over time, and many technologiesexist today that can further reduce residential energy con-sumption if they are purchased and used by more consumers. The CDEAC recognizes that a number of forces affect electrical demand and production. The Renewable PortfolioStandards adopted by several states were designed toexpand the role of renewable energy in Western resourceGenerating Capacity by Fuel Source - 2004 Nameplate Generating Capacity in WGA States- 319,500 MW Petroleum 1.3%Generation - Net Generation in WGA States - 1,216,272,570 MWh Source: 2004 EIA Annual Power Plant Report, excerpted for WGA member states2 portfolios. In fact, a substantial portion of the WGA's 30,000 megawatt clean energy goal is already reflected in Westernintegrated resource plans and renewable portfolio standards.It is imperative that state, regional and federal policies promote energy efficiency and the development ofadvanced generation together with the necessary transmis-sion infrastructure. The original goals of the Clean and Diversified Energy Initiative were viewed by some as optimistic. The work of theCDEAC demonstrates there are proven energy efficiencymeasures, abundant renewable resources, and emergingadvanced fossil fuel technologies that can not only help theWest achieve the Governors' ambitious energy goals for theregion, but also exceed them in an environmentally respon-sible way. Timely action to adopt and implement the policyrecommendations contained in this report will ensure acleaner, more diverse and stable energy future for the West. This report is a compilation of policy options developed through the work of all participants. Not all the recommen-dations represent a consensus. However, the CDEACrequests that all the recommendations be considered forsupport by each state where appropriate. Policy Recommendations for Consideration by Western Governors Planning for our Energy Future The CDEAC is providing Western Governors with a suite of policy options that, if adopted, will cost-effectivelyincrease energy efficiency and deliver clean energyresources to consumers in the West. The recommendationsthat follow were developed and adopted by the CDEACafter analyzing and balancing affordability, environmentalperformance, resource diversity, domestic energy securityand reliability implications. The recommendations spanstate, regional and federal forums. While the CDEAC recognizes that the Governors have a wide range of policy priorities, their support for these poli-cies at the national level will greatly increase the chances oftheir adoption and implementation. The regional recom-mendations will require cooperation among states to besuccessful. The state policy recommendations are presentedas a menu of options from which the Governors can selectthe most appropriate policies for their states. Finally, theCDEAC agrees that policy and funding predictability is critical to achieving the energy efficiency and clean energygoals established by Western Governors. State Policies Market Incentives Energy Efficiency - Create incentives for and promote energy efficiency levels that go beyond the standard energy efficiencycodes for new buildings, commercial construction, appliances and equipment. - Expand those energy efficiency programs that have proven effective in promoting best practices in industrialenergy management and combined heat and power. Renewable Energy - Consider the establishment of state-based incentive programs to promote the development of energy efficiency, conservation and clean energy technologies,including, but not limited to, production incentives andclean energy bonds. - Consider the provision of property and sales tax incen- tives and credits for energy efficiency, conservation andclean energy developments. - Facilitate investments in clean distributed generation by developing net metering, interconnection standardsand time-of-use rate structures. - Develop a methodology that fairly and fully evaluates the net non-energy benefits of all clean energy technologies, particularly Bioenergy projects. Developmodel incentives that convert those benefits to bankable credits (GHG credits, emission trade-offs in permitting and fire hazard reduction credits).

Incentive Regulation/Planning Energy Efficiency and Combined Heat and Power - Encourage electric and natural gas utilities to invest in all cost-effective energy efficiency measures using bestpractices for utility energy efficiency and conservationprograms. - Work with state PUCs to establish energy savings targets; provide utilities with necessary cost recovery;consider performance-based incentives, and eliminatedisincentives to utility investment in cost-effective energy efficiency measures for their customers; - Upgrade to state-of-the-art efficiency building codes and appliance standards (for products not yet coveredby national standards) and provide support for codeimplementation through education, training andenhanced building inspection and enforcement. - Establish public sector procurement programs for ENERGY STAR and other types of high-efficiency appliances and equipment. - Give fair credit for power plant emissions reductions in environmental review of CHP projects. - Decouple utility revenues from throughput and ensure that electricity rates are not discriminatory to CHP . Renewable Energy - Support well-designed comprehensive integrated resource planning and procurement rules that weighthe full costs, benefits and risks (including environmental)of various resource options for public and investor- owned utilities. Planning should integrate considerationof supply-side resources, demand-side resources andtransmission needs. Planning and procurement rulesshould be transparent and allow full participation of the public. - For emerging clean energy technologies, provide regulatory incentives such as full and accelerated cost-recovery. - Evaluate and develop appropriate incentives/policies that recognize the non-energy benefits of renewableenergy projects, particularly the environmental andwaste management services provided by biomass projects. If utilities are the entities selected to provide supplemental support to the renewable project, theyshould receive full cost recovery for such activities. - Standardize the process for procurement and infra- structure planning/integration for clean energy technologies (long-term Power Purchase Agreements permitting, interconnection). Advanced Fossil Fuel Generation - Allow utility recovery of costs for Tier 1 and Tier II project development studies. - Allow utility recovery of costs for studies of the carbon sequestration potential of existing and potential plant sites. - To address higher costs and operational risks, allow pre-approval and full-cost recovery for Tier 1 and Tier IIprojects, provided appropriate steps are taken to A net-zero house combines state-of-the-art, energy-efficient construc- tion and appliances with renewable energy systems such as solar waterheating and solar electricity to produce as much energy as it consumes.Photo Courtesy NREL/Pix - Paul Norton Agricultural residue, such as these walnuts, is just one form of biomass that is used to produce electricity. Photo Courtesy NREL/Pix - Warren Gretz4manage costs and risks. - Expedite permitting for Tier 1 and Tier II projects, while maintaining full public participation and the protectionof human health and the environment, including con-sideration of the full range of impacts of associatedinfrastructure. - An explanation of the two tiers and details on additional recommendations are contained in Appendix A to this report. Transmission Smart Transmission Planning - Ensure that targeted energy efficiency, CHP , and other demand-side resources are incorporated into state transmission planning. - Ensure that utility interconnection policies best facilitate the use of a wide range of clean energy resources. - Urge utilities to assess available transmission capacity and opportunities to make better use of the existingtransmission systems. Reduce Costs and Risks for Clean Energy - Encourage the elimination of rate pancaking (separate transmission payments to multiple line owners fordelivering electricity) and offer short-term transmissionservices and products (such as \"conditional firm\" [firmtransmission service during months of the year when itis available and some reduced level of service duringless available months of the year]). - Encourage the implementation of cost-recovery mech- anisms for transmission, such as state transmissionauthorities, and provide for state and utility review andparticipation in regional transmission planning processes. - Consider the establishment of tiered standards of review for prudency and the application of incentivesfor transmission expansion costs. They should feature a lower standard for screening studies and planning, a moderate standard for permitting and the acquisitionof rights-of-way, and a higher standard for constructioncosts. - Work with companies to ensure transmission is expanded in advance of generation to enable the modular devel-opment of location-constrained, clean and diversifiedresource areas to meet cost-effective renewable portfolio standards, and resource planning goals in an environmentally sound manner. - Work with utilities to establish policies that reward, not penalize, appropriately sized facilities for local load andvoltage support. Regional Cooperation Energy Efficiency - Facilitate the creation of regional market-transformation organizations for energy efficiency modeled on theNorthwest Energy Efficiency Alliance. Interstate Clean Energy Trading - Consider the establishment of a forum for interstate negotiations that match consumer states and generatorstates to develop and provide funding for major inter-state clean energy projects. Collaborate on the designof a variety of incentive mechanisms, such as rate base,sales/severance tax forgiveness. - Develop and accelerate mechanisms for clean-energy regional markets, such as the Western RenewableEnergy Generation Information System, which verifiesand tracks regional renewable energy generation. - Encourage Western state trading for appropriately defined environmental attributes as agreed upon bythe participants. Such a framework can be extended in the future for any environmental attribute. Thisapproach will facilitate compliance reporting by load-serving entities that are required to comply with state-adopted renewable portfolio standards. - Work for the implementation of state-level incentives to reduce the program costs for energy efficiency andclean energy technologies through economies of scaleand consistency across state programs. Unified Policies - Continue regional collaboration on clean energy policy, linking efficiency, clean generation and transmission. Transmission - Continue regional transmission planning efforts, includ- ing establishment of energy transmission corridors thatfacilitate wheeling of energy from clean energy sourcesand an open season process by project developers todemonstrate demand and value for new transmissionprojects. - Urge Power Marketing Administrations to offer short- term transmission services, such as \"conditional firm.\" Continued regional transmission planning is a necessary step to ensure that new clean and diverse generation can be brought online. PhotoCourtesy NREL/Pix - Warren Gretz- Synchronize regional transmission planning efforts to resource acquisition plans of load serving entities (LSE)and plans of generators. - Urge FERC and PUCs to form joint panels on transmis- sion cost recovery that would explicitly consider risksand the need for incentive policies. - Coordinate multi-state review of transmission projects by developing common principles for cost allocationand cost recovery, and adopt a common Western procedural process that woul d identify and coordinate the applications, forms, analyses and deadlines. National Policy Recommendations Energy Efficiency - Encourage timely adoption of updates to the national appliance efficiency standards. - Encourage Congress to extend current tax incentives for 10 years for innovative energy efficiency technologies. Renewable Energy - Extend the long-term (10 years) production tax credit and investment tax credit across all clean energy technologies; provide for partnership sharing of taxcredits for certain entities, such as tribes; extend andraise the cap on new clean energy bonding authorityfor nonprofits (public power) and Native American tribal authorities; and raise the cap on the residentialinvestment tax credit to $10,000. - Provide long-term (10 years), adequate funding for energy efficiency and clean generation and storagetechnology RD&D, Energy Star programs, state-basedclean energy initiatives. - Encourage federal agencies to collaborate and work with states and Western regional organizations on siting of new generation and infrastructure facilities, 5 Renewable technologies can often be combined to increase reliability and output. Photo Courtesy NREL/Pix - Warren Gretzconsistent with sound, sustainable environmental practices. - Support power marketing administration studies of opportunities to integrate wind. - Encourage long-term (20-years) and large forest-health contracting, collaboratively determined, using a science-based assessment of the resource to allow forbiomass resource development. Advanced Fossil Fuel Generation - Provide for a five year extension of the federal IGCC tax credit and propose a five- to ten-year tax credit program for carbon capture and sequestration. - Increase federal support and tax incentives for the construction of multiple pilot facilities that demonstrateIGCC using Western coal at high altitude in the WesternUnited States. Achieving the 20% Energy Efficiency Goal by 2020 A \"Win-Win\" for consumers and businesses Energy efficiency and conservation are our cheapest, cleanest, least risky and least controversial energy strategies.Increasing the efficiency of energy use in Western states,without reducing productivity, will provide a broad range ofbenefits, including: saving consumers and businesses moneyon their energy bills; reducing vulnerability to energy pricespikes; reducing peak demand and improving the utilizationof the electricity system; reducing the risk of power short-ages; supporting local businesses and stimulating economicdevelopment; reducing water consumption and reducingpollutant emissions by reducing the need to construct newpower plants. Successful policies to promote energy efficiency and conservation include a mix of incentives, information, targetsand standards. All Western states are engaged to variousdegrees in implementing energy efficiency and conserva-tion measures, but significant untapped potential remains.An independent analysis of the \"best practices\" policies andprograms in the West compiled by the Energy Efficiency TaskForce indicates that it is feasible to cost-effectively reduceelectricity use 20% from projected levels in 2020, withoutsacrificing economic growth. The Task Force work suggeststhat aggressive deployment of the best practice policies andprograms throughout the West, each of which have beensuccessfully implemented in at least one Western state, andall of which rely on existing technologies, can reduce therate of growth in electricity demand by 1% per year or more. There are several model energy efficiency programs in the West. Exemplary best practice programs include:electricity and natural gas energy efficiency programs where6 consumption increased 1.7% per year on average during 1990 - 2003 in the 18 WGA states. This chart illustrates thatthe need for construction of new generating facilities wouldnot be eliminated over the next 15 years, but could bereduced by as much as 75%. The best practices scenario shows that it is possible to reduce electricity consumption in 2020 by 20% relative tothat in the reference scenario, or the equivalent of electricitysupplied by 100 baseload power plants. The CDEAC believesit is possible to achieve the energy efficiency goal enunciatedin the Clean and Diversified Energy Resolution, namely real-izing 20% electricity savings by 2020, assuming that a varietyof cost-effective incentive-based and other approaches aredeployed. Moreover, even greater electricity savings may bepossible through adoption of other strategies not includedin the best practices scenario, such as R&D, technology transfer or pricing initiatives. Benefits of the Best Practices Scenario 20% electricity savings by 2020, relative to the reference scenario 48,000 MW of avoided power plant construction during 2005 - 2020 Small reduction in electricity prices in the latter part of study period $53 billion in net economic benefits for consumers and businesses Substantial avoidance of power plant emissions Approximately 1.8 trillion gallons of water savings during 2005 - 2020 Implementing the best practice energy effi- ciency and conservation policies and programswould provide substantial economic benefits forhouseholds and businesses in Western states. By2020, these efforts could lower electricity bills inthe aggregate by $21 billion per year. Based onthe analyses done by the Energy Efficiency TaskForce, the best practices scenario would yield $53 billion in net economic benefits during 2005 - 2020 on a net present value basis, with anoverall benefit-cost ratio of 2.5. The benefits resultmainly from avoided fuel purchases by utilities,and avoided investment in generation, transmis-sion and distribution infrastructure. Furthermore,the benefits could be even greater as the cost ofnatural gas increases. Implementing the best practice energy effi- ciency and conservation policies and programs would also provide environmental benefits, including butnot limited to, reduced impacts on air quality, waterresources, terrestrial and marine biological resources, landuse, traffic and visual impacts. For emissions, it would reduceenergy efficiency is considered a resource and all cost- effective savings are pursued with investments of a percent-age of revenues, some exceeding 2% (saving energy at and \"beyond code\" incentive programs;state appliance efficiency standards on products not covered by federal standards; RD&D and technology transfer;public sector initiatives including aggressive energy efficiencyand conservation goals for public buildings, public sectorprocurement standards, performance contracting to implement efficiency projects in the public sector; tax credits and other financial incentives; pricing and incentiveregulation policies; and regional cooperation and markettransformation efforts. Energy Efficiency Potential In order to assess potential electricity savings and the impacts of more aggressive energy efficiency and conserva-tion efforts in Western states, the Energy Efficiency Task Forceconducted an independent energy savings analysis, devel-oping and analyzing the following three scenarios for electricity demand in the 18-state region through 2020: Reference scenario: a slightly modified version of the 2005 reference case forecast prepared by the EnergyInformation Administration, applied to WGA states. Current Activities scenario: adjusting the reference scenario to account for the estimated impacts of ongoingand recently enacted policies and programs at the state,regional or utility levels. Best Practices scenario: aggressive adoption of \"best practice\" policies and programs in all 18 states. As shown in the figure above, load growth during 2003 - 2020 averages 1.9% per year in the reference scenario, 1.3%per year in the current activities scenario, and 0.5% per yearin the best practices scenario.

Therefore, the CDEAC took a critical lookat the task force reports to ensure they clearly identified thelimitations and obstacles that each technology would facein ramping up to meet the Governors' challenge. The results of this process were surprisingly robust and optimistic. While some might consider the goal of 30,000 MW quite aggressive, the process documents that clean energy technologies can meet and even exceed this goal. Whileeach task force took a slightly different analytical approach,the results demonstrated that significant contributionscould be expected from each technology and, together, theycould surpass expectations. Furthermore, the task forcesonly considered reasonable development scenarios, under-standing that the technical potential for clean energy in theWestern states is far greater than the 30,000MW goal. Any summary presentation of the task force reports (and white papers) should be carefully qualified. Each makescertain assumptions and involves a degree of uncertainty,and each presents conclusions that demonstrate substantialfuture contributions to the West's energy needs beyondachieving the CDEAC goals. But, together, the reports painta reasonably reliable picture of the overall clean energypotential in the West and what can be achieved by 2015. Here are some of the highlights of the task force conclusions: According to the report of the Solar Energy Task Force, asmuch as 8,000 megawatts of capacity could be installedwith a combination of distributed solar electricity systemsand central concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, whileanother 2,000 MW (thermal) of solar hot water is realisti-cally available. sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, carbon dioxide, and mercury. Energy efficiency and conservation best practices would result in water savings from both increased use of energyand water saving devices and from reduced power plantoperation. In addition, water savings resulting from theseprograms will provide reductions in energy required forwater treatment, pumping, distribution and heating. Thetask force estimates that the best practices scenario wouldsave 260 billion gallons of water per year by 2020 relative tothe reference scenario, equivalent to the annual water use of about 1.4 million households. Total water savings during2005 - 2020 in this scenario would be approximately 1.8 trillion gallons. The CDEAC believes increasing energy efficiency and conservation should be an important component of theclean energy strategies developed and implemented in theWest. Governors, legislatures, state regulatory commissionsand the private sector should work in concert to enact newincentive-based and other policies aimed at increasing theefficiency of electricity and natural gas use. While there is no\"silver bullet\" for overcoming the barriers that are inhibitingwidespread energy efficiency and conservation improve-ments, there are a variety of proven policies and programsthat are available to states. Achieving the 30,000 MW Clean Energy Goal by 2015 The Future Potential Clean energy technologies represent some of the fastest growing sectors of the energy market. It was the goal of theCDEAC to determine what portion of the West's energyneeds could be met through these technologies. Using theexpertise from its task forces, the CDEAC examined each ofthe following technologies: energy efficiency, solar, geother-mal, wind, biomass, advanced coal and transmission. In addition, white papers were presented to the CDEAC onwater power potential and natural gas. Our conclusion isinescapably clear \u2014 these technologies present the Westwith a rich array of choices to meet or even exceed the30,000 MW goal. \"The results of this process were surprisingly robust and optimistic. Whilesome might consider the goal of 30,000 MWquite aggressive, the process documents thatclean energy technologies can meet and evenexceed this goal.\" Concentrating photovoltaic cells, such as this array in Arizona, help the West take advantage of its vast solar resources.

The Advanced Coal Task Force recognized the major contribution coal currently makes in meeting the West'senergy needs. The task force supported continuingefforts to improve the operational and environmentalperformance of all of the advanced coal technologies listedin a Technology Report, beyond current performance levels, with the ultimate goal of achieving near zero emis-sions at a competitive cost of electricity. The task forcerecognized that with these improvements advanced coaltechnologies could continue to provide our region with asizeable share of its overall baseload power needs.Further, it recommended specific state-level incentives forthe development of advanced coal technologies that arenot yet commercially viable and operate with superiorenvironmental performance. These state-level incentivesare outlined in Appendix A to this report. The Biomass Task Force concluded that biomass has thepotential to supply 10,000 MW of electricity by 2015. The Wind Task Force concluded that wind developmentthat is either in progress or can be reasonably assumedwith minimal transmission additions would be between5,000 and 9,175 MW. This amount could rise dramatically(to more than 25,000 MW) as transmission becomes available. The white paper on Combined Heat and Power (CHP)estimates a technical potential of 42,800 MW of additionalCHP potential in the WGA region. Finally, the water power white paper presented to theCDEAC identified incremental hydropower potential of3,000 MW at existing sites already connected to the grid. Each of the reports goes much further than these highlights represent, but they demonstrate energy potentialthat substantially exceeds the 30,000 MW goal. Clearly, manythousands of megawatts more are available from each ofthese technologies, but the CDEAC did not seek to determineprecise contributions from each one or to compare andcontrast the different opportunities. It is fair to say that eachof these technologies can make a significant contribution toachieving the 30,000 MW goal. They also demonstrate thatthe West has the luxury of pursuing a variety of options tomeet this clean power goal, while diversifying the Westernresource portfolio. By pursuing a portfolio of clean energytechnologies, the West should be able to achieve the CDEACgoal with substantial certainty. While there are many questions that remain about the development of clean energy technologies, a common challenge to their ultimate development is transmission. ATransmission Task Force examined this cross cutting issueand concluded that while transmission is always a large consideration with respect to the location of new generating facilities, transmission in and of itself should not be a barrier to achieving the 30,000 MW goal. That task force found: There are many uncertainties in estimating what transmission additions are required. Looking out to 2015,the task force estimates that additional transmission investment needed in the WGA States in the EasternInterconnection is in the range of 1.2 to 2.6 billion dollars, inthe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) 1.7 to 3.0billion, and the Western Interconnection several additionalbillions of dollars. While relatively large, transmission costsare less than 10 percent of the cost of the power deliveredto customers. Implementation of the recommendations ofthe Efficiency Task Force can potentially defer or even lessenthe need for some new transmission investment. The evaluation of transmission needs is not a one-time process.Changing circumstances require an on-going robust trans-mission planning process that continually reassesses the uncertainties inherent in long-term transmission planning. Additionally, many of the clean energy technologies examined by the previously discussed task forces can provide distributed generation. Distributed generation fromsolar, wind, geothermal and other technologies may be ableto obviate some transmission expenses and provide supportto the existing grid. The goal of achieving 30,000 MW of clean energy by 2015 is within reach. The benefits of this goal would be sub-stantial. Together, these technologies can provide reliable,cost-effective energy to meet the needs of the West, whileimproving environmental quality, enhancing national security,and providing tens of thousands of new jobs and stimulatingeconomic growth. The real questions that need to beaddressed are less those of technical potential or transmis-sion investment, and more questions of public policy. Toachieve these goals and realize the potential benefits,sustained state and federal policies need to be in place supporting the development and deployment of thesetechnologies and the transmission investment needed tomove these energy resources to consumers. The average power generation at the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington is 21 billion kilowatt hours per year.3Environmental, Reliability and Cost Considerations A Western energy system that meets the WGA clean and diversified energy objectives will significantly mitigate someof the region's most serious environmental and publichealth problems and result in overall environmental benefitsto the West, including reduction in land impacts, consump-tion and pollution of scarce water resources, and air emissionssuch as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter andmercury. In addition, the recommendations in this report,including those from the Advanced Coal Task Force, willdrive toward reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide andpotentially toward recovery and sequestration of carbon forbeneficial uses. The resource task force reports individually identified cost and reliability issues and the CDEAC considered theseduring the discussion of recommendations. The CDEAC alsorecognizes that Integrated Resource Plans look closely atthese issues and encourage planners to carefully evaluatethese aspects of clean energy development and use. Inaddition, individual state public utility commissions and legislatures are encouraged to address a series of practicalissues that are part of the planning process. Each state willneed to consider which resources and technologies areavailable in their area, the demand growth in their state, andwhether these require considering technologies to meetbase- and peak-load needs, fuel reduction or other needs. In comparison to today's energy system, or the projected energy situation without adoption of progressive policies,the recommended energy policies will: Diversify the region's energy resource base, providing further protection from consumers against energy pricespikes and shortages.Produce more affordable, reliable and clean power to fueleconomic growth throughout the region and helpincrease family incomes. Increase America's ability to produce more American energy, thus lessening our reliance on foreign sources of energy. Increase the efficiency with which we use energy, therebyreducing the rate of growth of energy demand and lessening the environmental impacts inherent with allenergy generation technologies; Increase generation from low water-consuming and zero- and low-emission renewable energy resources; and Increase generation from near-zero emission advancedcoal technologies. Energy efficiency programs and policies can reduce the need for new generating facilities and improve the oper-ations efficiency of existing power resources. This translatesdirectly into lower emissions, such as particulate matter,mercury, nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide and sulfur oxide.They also save water and decrease risks to water quality \u2014both in electric generation facilities and in homes, officesand industrial facilities. Solar, geothermal and wind resources emit little or no pollutants and require little or no water for system operation.Use of biomass electricity provides multiple ancillary envi-ronmental benefits. CHP is an efficient, clean, economicaland reliable resource option as well. Advanced coal technologies offer the potential for greatly improved emission performance for criteria pollutants andmercury, with the ability to integrate capture systems thatare capable of removing substantial emissions. 9 The largest geothermal field in the world is The Geysers, near San Francisco. Photo Courtesy NREL/Pix - Pacific Gas and Electric10APPENDIX A - Fuel Task Force Recommendations Advanced Coal The Advanced Coal Task Force reached a carefully crafted agreement with regard to its support for advanced coaltechnologies. The language of that agreement, and thestate-level incentives targeted only to Tier 1 and Tier 2 technologies that were agreed to are listed below. In addition to these state-level incentives, the CDEAC agrees to support two federal-level incentives for advancedcoal technologies listed earlier in this report. ACTF Agreement on Advanced Coal Technologies A. Support for continuing efforts to improve the efficiency and environmental performance of alladvanced coal technologies examined by the task force. The ACTF's Technology Work Group examined the costs, performance and environmental characteristics of a varietyof commercially available and emerging advanced coal-firedelectrical generation technologies, including supercriticaland ultra supercritical pulverized and circulating fluidizedbed combustion technologies, integrated gasification combined cycle technologies. The Technology Work Groupreport found that the advanced technologies examined typically demonstrate higher performance levels and loweremissions of criteria pollutants, toxic pollutants and CO 2 emissions than new subcritical designs, as well as the currentfleet of pulverized coal plants now in operation. The taskforce supports continuing efforts to improve the operationaland environmental performance of all of the advanced coaltechnologies listed in the Technology Report, beyond cur-rent performance levels, with the ultimate goal of achievingnear zero emissions at a competitive cost of electricity. B. Support incentives for the development of advanced coal technologies that are not yet commerciallyviable and operate with superior environmental performance. The ACTF recommends that state-level incentives should be directed only to certain advanced coal technologies intwo \"Tiers.\"The ACTF recognizes that the process for approv-ing the incentives for specific projects will be through existing state-level legislative and regulatory proceedings,and that these will be subject to full participation by interested stakeholders and the public. Tier I: The ACTF recommends that Western Governors and the Western states place the highest priority on providing incen-tives to facilitate the development of four to five electricity generating plants (approximately 2,000 MW total) that use coal for fuel and that capture and sequester at least 60% oftheir CO 2emissions. The ACTF recommends that a full set of state-level incentives be provided to Tier I projects. Tier II In addition, the ACTF recommends that a subset of state incentives be provided to projects (approximately3,000 MW total) employing technologies not yet commer-cially deployed in the West that most cost-effectively andrapidly move toward zero emissions and carbon capture andsequestration. These technologies could include, but are notlimited to, gasification, ultra supercritical coal and oxy-combustion. Tier I and Tier II Incentives: Incentives available for Tier I and II projects should include the following: Development Direct state Public Utility Commissions to allow utilityrecovery of costs for Tier I and Tier II project developmentstudies. Direct state PUCs to allow utility recovery of costs forstudies of the sequestration potential of existing andpotential plant sites. Siting and Permitting Provide expedited permitting for Tier I and Tier II projects,while maintaining full public participation and the pro-tection of human health and the environment, includingconsideration of the full range of impacts of associatedinfrastructure. Direct the relevant state agencies to evaluate and, ifappropriate, considering other relevant siting factors,facilitate the siting of Tier I and Tier II projects in proximityto geologic sequestration, CO 2transportation infrastruc- ture, or opportunities to use CO 2in economically beneficial activities. Cost Recovery Certainty Allow resource pre-approval and full cost recovery. Toaddress the higher costs and operational risks of Tier I andTier II projects, utilities developing such projects shouldbe ensured full and timely cost recovery, provided theytake appropriate steps to manage costs and risks.Regulators should also consider additional cost recoveryincentives to address the higher costs of financing theconstruction of Tier I and Tier II projects. Utility power purchase agreements (PPAs) with an independent power producer to develop Tier I or Tier IIprojects should also be allowed pre-approval and full costrecovery, provided appropriate steps are taken to managecosts and risks.Adopt Integrated Resource Planning rules that recognize the full benefits of Tier I and Tier II projects. Direct PUCs to provide for cost recovery for participatingin sequestration demonstration projects or geologicalassessments designed to facilitate the siting of Tier I andTier II projects. Performance Encourage appropriate \"pass through\" of purchase powercosts or, in the case of gasification plants, replacementcombustion turbine fuel necessary, if a Tier I or Tier II proj-ect does not deliver anticipated electrical generationavailability. Research Direct the relevant state agencies to conduct or supportassessments to identify sites for Tier I and Tier II projectswith access to geological sequestration opportunities,CO 2transportation infrastructure, or opportunities to use CO 2in economically beneficial activities. Tier I Incentives: In addition to the incentives outlined above, Tier I projects should be provided the additional incentives listed below.Tier I incentives would be available to Tier II projects thatundergo modification to qualify as Tier I facilities. It is theACTF's belief that the development of Tier I facilities in theWest offers the best opportunity to move toward the ultimategoal of near zero emissions for new coal-fired generation. Tothe extent that there is a conflict due to limited resources forproviding incentives to Tier I or Tier II projects, the ATCFbelieves that Tier I resources should be given priority. Financial Incentives Provide direct financial incentives, such as investment taxcredits, loan guarantees, etc., to Tier I projects. The same orsimilar financial incentives in the Federal Energy PolicyAct could be utilized at the state level for Tier I projects. Direct state PUCs to allow higher rates of return for Tier I projects. Provide direct payments, subsidies, or tax credits on a dollarper ton basis for CO 2sequestered from a Tier I facility. Use a portion of state severance (excise), property (ad valorem), and sales taxes, or provide royalty relief, toprovide financial incentives for encouraging the use ofCO 2captured from Tier I projects in enhanced oil recovery projects (EOR) or other economically beneficial use ofcaptured CO 2. Establish loan guarantees or bond funds to assist withCO 2capture, compression and transportation infrastructure necessary for Tier I projects. Regulatory Have relevant state agencies develop CO 2storage regula- tions for Tier I projects that protect public health and theenvironment without putting unnecessary roadblocks inthe way of the implementation of Tier I projects. Direct relevant state agencies to develop and implementprotocols to account for and monitor the fate ofsequestered CO 2(including leakage) from Tier I projects. Authorize new positions within the appropriate state regulatory agencies responsible for the oversight andmonitoring (including leakage) of EOR and other seques-tration activities associated with Tier I projects. Research Fund pilot programs for geologic sequestration in a variety of formations, including technology research,development and demonstration; monitoring the fate ofsequestered CO 2(including leakage); and evaluating environmental and public health and safety impacts togather information to help site and successfully developTier I projects. Education and Outreach Fund education and outreach programs to inform stakeholders and the public of the issues involved insequestration from Tier I projects. Fund education and outreach programs to reverse thecurrent perception of limited career opportunities withinthe energy and regulatory fields related to EOR and othersequestration activities. Encourage/support educationalprograms at the collegiate level, focused on internships,and/or field experience with knowledgeable practitioners. Coordination of State-level Incentives Some measures may be more effective than others in any given state; and adopting some measures may be morepolitically feasible in some states than in others. To theextent that states coordinate their incentives, they will beable to foster a more consistent project development environment across state boundaries. Such consistency willallow multi-state utility \"consortiums\" in advanced coal project development to take advantage of lower overallcosts through economies of scale. Biomass The report's analysis shows that Governors can have a tremendous positive impact on the region's energy supply,transmission capacity and economic health by implement-ing a few realistic policy recommendations. 1112Recommendations The Biomass Task Force developed the following ten recommendations to respond to challenges that biomassresource from meeting its true energy, environmental, andeconomic potential. The recommendations come from ananalysis of the most important barriers to competitivenessof the resource relative to other fuel sources and barriers torealizing the benefits of the resource that come from avoiding the environmental costs of not using woody or wet biomass as an energy source. The Task Force stresses in the report that each recom- mendation is an important step in realizing the full use ofbiomass. Selecting one or two of the recommendations willnot have the same effect as if those same recommendationswere implemented along with the others. The recommenda-tions with brief descriptions follow: 1. Achieve Tax Parity Among Renewable Technologies. Governors should work at the federal level with theircongressional delegations to promote biomass as part ofthe Production Tax Credit contained in Section 45 of IRSRegulations. Parity should be achieved with wind andgeothermal technologies in credit level and the creditshould be permanent. Credit for existing facilities shouldbe extended to 10 years to match current provisions fornew facilities. At the state level, Governors should advo-cate for parity in state tax incentives and they should bebased on actual energy generation (both heat andpower) as opposed to investment tax incentives. Again,programs should be at least for 10 years. Parity continuesto net metering for plants of less than 1 MW of produc-tion. Compensation should be provided for export ofexcess power. The Western Governors can play an impor-tant part in ensuring the widespread adoption of thesepolicies across the region. 2. Strengthen Federal Land Management Policies to Allow Larger, Longer Restoration Projects.Only long term, large-scale activities will attract infra-structure investment. Governors should work within theirborders with federal land managers to ensure that theyare using the most appropriate land management toolsuch as stewardship contracting or timber sale methods.Contracting tools are most helpful when they are longterm (20-year minimum) and large scale (up to 150,000acres or larger). Contracts should be based on the science-based needs of the resource to improve foresthealth. Project parameters should be collaborativelydecided at the local level on a project-by-project basis.There should not be pre-determined artificial constraintson material use or tree diameter size. These should alsobe collaboratively determined based on the science- based needs of the resource. Arbitrary constraints hinder the commercial viability of the resource. 3. Environmental Benefits of Biomass Should Be Paid for by Beneficiaries.Governors should advocate their legislatures and regula-tory bodies on behalf of the ability of biomass projectsto help solve problems such as waste disposal, air qualityand forest land/fire management. Solutions couldinclude fuel subsidies and \"biomass RFPs to addressspecific situations. Above-market costs should be borneby the primary beneficiaries of the environmental andwaste management services. If utilities are the entitiesselected to provide supplemental support to biomasspower, they should receive cost recovery for those activities. 4. Demonstrate Government Leadership by Purchasing Power/RECs from Biomass Projects and bySupporting Biomass R&D.The state and federal governments should purchase biomass power directly, or an equivalent amount ofrenewable energy credits (RECs), to meet renewable purchase requirements. This would be a tangible demon-stration that agencies realize the benefits biomass bringsin addressing air quality, forest health, landfill space andrural economic growth. Programs should rely on incentivesthat are independent of annual budget and appropria-tions cycles. The Governors should also take a leadershiprole in supporting cost shared R&D in partnership withthe private sector to demonstrate the use of new biomass technologies and to conduct engineeringdevelopment research that will lead to near-term commercialization of improved conversion and harvest-ing technology. 5. Recognize the Value of Firm Capacity in Renewable Purchase Programs.The Governors should work with the state utility commissions to ensure that utility renewable purchaseprograms (renewable portfolio standards or otherwise)recognize the firming capacity of biomass by establishingthe appropriate price structure. The ability of biomass toprovide constant power is both a benefit in and of itself,and it can also be used to address the intermittentnature of other resources. 6. Renewable Energy Credits Should Not Include Ancillary Environmental Benefits.The many benefits of biomass may be accounted for infuture credit schemes (such as air quality compliance)and can bring added value to the resource. Current RECsshould be defined in a way that they only transfer therenewable nature of the power and only the environ-mental benefits that result directly from displacement of a like amount of fossil-fueled generation. 7. Establish a Single Definition for Biomass. Governors should work with their state public utilitycommissioners and green power certification groups torequire that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission'sdefinition of biomass (18CFR Part 292.202) is used todetermine the eligibility of the resources as renewable.This definition,\"any organic material not derived fromfossil fuels,\" affords biomass energy projects the greatestopportunity and flexibility to use technology innovationto create productive uses for all types of biomass materials.The ability of biomass facilities to choose from the widearray of biomass resources, while conforming to all federal, state and community environmental standards,will allow the technology to improve both on technicalperformance and on production economics. 8. Revise Utility Interconnection Policies. Governors can work with their state public utility commissions to recognize the importance of local loadand voltage support by remote plants. This would helpprevent artificial imposition of line losses and promotereliability in remote areas. An emphasis on centralizedload centers falsely works from the assumption that allpower is consumed from a centralized location. 9. Provide Long-term Certainty for Biomass Programs. Governors should require that long-term programs insupport of biomass should be implemented. Long-termpower purchase contracts, fuel supply incentives, taxcredits and other measures will help provide the invest-ment environment needed for infrastructure growth. 10. Consider Fuel-based Emissions When Issuing Air Quality Permits.The avoided emissions of air pollutants from biomassplants' fuel, if that fuel is left to its alternate fate, shouldbe recognized and credited to the biomass plants in thepermitting process. True netting of the plant emissionsshould be done. Geothermal The Geothermal Task Force of the Clean and Diversified Energy Initiative reviewed geothermal resources of thestates in the Western Governors' Association region. On July 25, 2005, two dozen members of the geothermal com-munity met in Reno, Nevada, to assess the potential for commercial development of roughly 140 known geothermalsites. The task force also estimated the economics of developing these sites for commercial power production forprojects that could be online in a timeframe extending to 2015. Finally, the task force compiled a profile of recommen- dations for interstate policy and regulatory frameworks toinduce development of the Western states' renewable energyby 2015. The options for policy and regulatory direction outlined in this report provide a rich opportunity to set acommon, strategic energy development. In summary, theGeothermal Task Force offers these recommendations to the CDEAC and WGA: Market Development - The marketplace needs to support the continued development of geothermal resources. 1. Federal and state tax credits are important to reduce the risk and high capital cost of new projects. The federalproduction tax credit (and clean renewable bondingauthority) should be made permanent, or at least extended 10 years. 2. State laws and regulations should promote a continuing series of opportunities for power purchase agreementsbetween developers and utilities. Whether generatedthrough Renewable Portfolio Standards, IntegratedResource Planning, or other mechanisms, power purchasecontracts are fundamental drivers of the market. 3. Federal and state laws and regulations should provide incentives for utilities and others to enter into long-termcontracts for renewable power. Accounting and regula-tory standards should treat renewable power contractsas benefits instead of liabilities, and power purchase contracts should have the backing of the government to ensure their credit worthiness. Timely Permitting and Environmental Reviews - Geothermal projects should be prioritized to ensure thatpermitting, leasing and environmental reviews are completedin a timely and efficient manner.1. Federal, state and local agencies should coordinate resources and requirements. Agencies should be desig-nated to take the lead on specific issues to avoid duplication, and once issues are resolved, they should not be revisited without cause. 2. A critical path for new projects should be defined as part of this cooperative effort, and timeframes for key agencydecisions along the pathway should be established. Transmission Access and Adequacy - The Western Governors should lead the process to ensure that adequatetransmission is available for the identified resources.1. There should be consistent Western state policies on inter-connection to the grid that facilitate new geothermal(and other renewable) power development. 2. A fee to support the cost of new transmission could be set that would spread the cost across all states, partiesand technologies on a capacity basis. 13143. Both inter- and intra-state transmission is needed to support the identified resources and should be fast-tracked for permitting and environmental reviews. Federal Program Support - Continuing support from key federal programs is needed to achieve the 2015 goals.Federal programs should be coordinated with state agencies.1. As the National Research Council concluded (Renewable Power Pathways, 2002), given the enormous potential ofthe resource base, geothermal research by the U.S.Department of Energy should be increased, particularlyinto technologies that can reduce risk, reduce costs orexpand the accessible resource base. 2. Better resource information is needed. The USGS' new resource assessment and DOE's cost-shared drilling andexploration technology efforts should be priorities. The US Department of Energy's GeoPowering the West initiative should continue to support state and local govern-ments, Indian tribes and others seeking to utilize the West'suntapped geothermal resources. Solar The Solar Task Force offers the following set of recom- mendations to the Governors that, if enacted, will enablesolar technologies to make a meaningful contribution to the30,000 MW of new clean, diversified energy: Work aggressively with Congressional delegations toextend the 30% federal investment tax credit to a 10-yearterm and remove the $2,000 cap on residential systems. Expand the deployment of central solar plants byencouraging 30-year power purchase agreements andaggregation of utility plant orders and project bids toaccelerate scale-up cost reductions. Encourage widespread adoption of distributed solar bycreating incentives either in the form of declining up-front rebates that help reduce the \"first cost\" challenge inpurchasing a solar system or by establishing ongoing performance-based incentives that pay for production ofelectricity, both of which have been adopted in certainWGA states. Incentives should be available to both solarthermal (space heating and cooling as well as water heating) and solar electricity systems and apply equally toresidential and commercial buildings. Reward solar production and encourage conservationduring critical peak periods by facilitating simplified inter-connection standards, net metering and rate structuresthat will benefit distributed solar systems. Exempt both CSP plants and distributed solar systemsfrom state and local sales and property taxes. The loss tostate treasuries of these taxes will be more than compen-sated by increases in tax revenues through growth in personal and corporate income taxes, gross receipts taxesfrom equipment sales, compensating taxes on imported equipment and other taxes specific to electric utilities. In addition, some of the money that now leaves states'economies for energy purchases will instead remain at home. Integrate solar into existing state policies such as aRenewable Portfolio Standard, which can help developcentral and distributed solar markets when structuredproperly. Consider adopting target tariffs that reflect the value ofsolar energy for peak periods and that adjust for naturalgas price changes. Wind The Task Force believes that implementation of the following top 10 recommendations will result in far morewind development than would otherwise be the case. Financial Incentives The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been instrumental in encouraging investment in wind energy projects, increasingthe economies of scale in the production of wind turbines,and thereby lowering the costs of production.Unfortunately, the stop-and-start nature of the PTC under-cuts the incentive benefits of the PTC and undermines stable growth of the emerging wind energy industry. Along-term extension of the federal PTC is vital to expand theexperience with integrating large amounts of intermittentresources into the power system, continue technologyadvances, and drive costs down through mass deployment. Recommendation 1: Enact a long-term extension of the federal Production Tax Credit and comparable incentivesthat would be useful to nonprofits, tax exempt entities,public utilities and tribes. Alternative financial incentive poli-cies include the use of tax exempt bond financing, tradabletax credits and partnership sharing of tax credits for certainentities, such as tribes. Efficient Use of the Existing Transmission System Transmission is a critical limiting factor in the deployment of wind resources. The Wind Task Force has identifiednumerous opportunities where changes to tariffs, policiesand operations would lead to a more efficient use of theexisting transmission system. These short-term reformscould enable wind energy, which can be deployed in as littleas 18 months, to expand in advance of major transmissionadditions. Recommendation 2: Implement a conditional-firm, re-dispatch, and related tariff reform transmission productswhere feasible and consistent with the policy of an inde-pendent system operator or regional transmission organization. Support the review and reasonable assess-ment of Available Transfer Capability (ATC) on existing transmission paths. Recommendation 3: Reform imbalance penalty policy based on cost-causation principles and link to near-termscheduling and wind forecasting. Transmission Expansion Future wind energy development necessary to attain WGA's 30,000 MW goal in a cost effective manner willrequire expanding the existing transmission system.Numerous existing barriers hinder future transmissionexpansion. The Wind Task Force recommends followingmid- and long-term reforms to ensure a more rationalapproach to transmission expansion consistent with developing wind and other clean energy resources. Recommendation 4: Urge state commissions, state legisla- tures and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)to encourage expanded transmission services and facilitiesfor wind resource development areas to meet renewableportfolio standards (RPS), integrated resource plans (IRP) andstate goals. Such actions should, build upon recent Texasand Minnesota legislation and the renewable trunk line(Tehachapi) model for new transmission to major windresource areas. Recommendation 5: (a) Enhance regional transmission planning capabilities to better identify beneficiaries of transmission expansion,recognizing that some benefits of transmission expansionare widely distributed; (b) urge public utility commissions in states with RPS requirements to recognize the public benefits of trans-mission that supports renewable generation, and grantrolled-in rates/cost recovery; and (c) coordinate federal, state, local, and tribal siting for trans- mission and wind projects, and develop transmission corridors on federal lands. Integration Costs and Reliability A growing body of studies and experience in different parts of the world confirms that large amounts of wind canbe integrated into utility systems without detrimental effectson system reliability. The evidence suggests that the cost ofintegrating wind generation increases as the percentage ofwind in the system increases. However, on average, the costof integrating wind at levels of 10 - 20 percent of systemcapacity is small compared to the price of power, accordingto studies performed to date. The ability to integrate largeamounts of wind depends on many factors, including the size of control areas (or virtual control areas), the commit- ment and skill of system operators, the other types of gener-ation in the system and the implementation of storage. Recommendation 6: Support studies of integration costs for higher levels of wind penetrations and allow utility costrecovery of such study costs. Such studies should examinehow choices of other generating resources affect the abilityto incorporate large amounts of wind resources. Recommendation 7: Support studies of opportunities for federal power marketing administrations to integrate largeamounts of wind into the power system. Recommendation 8: Support studies and R&D to develop storage and generating options that can complement theintermittency of wind generation. Regulatory and Procurement Policies State government through its utility regulatory policies and procurement policies has the capability to significantlyincrease the deployment of wind resources. Many Westernstates have adopted Renewable Portfolio Standards andSystem Benefit Charges that provide incentives for additionalwind generation. Other states have provisions for regulatedutilities to provide their PUCs with utility resource plans indicating the preferred mix of generating resource additions. Recommendation 9: Require that state utility commissions implement incentives for regulated utilities that make newwind resource acquisitions a profitable course of actionthrough performance-based regulatory systems. For munici-pal and cooperative utilities, seek revisions to federal andstate financing tools or tax structures to provide financialincentives encouraging increased use of wind energy. Recommendation 10: Governors can take the following government procurement steps to support wind energy:(a) Direct state agencies and public educational institutions to procure wind energy through green power marketingand purchasing programs and/or by acquiringRenewable Energy Certificates. A minimum 10% of agovernmental entity's electricity requirements is recommended as a goal; (b) Encourage tribal and local governments to procure wind energy through green power marketing and purchasingprograms and/or by the acquisition of Renewable EnergyCertificates. A minimum 10% of a governmental entity'selectricity requirements is recommended as a goal; (c) Pursue smaller-scale wind projects for self-generation through the use of net-metering, wheeling of power orother available mechanisms. A commitment of fundingand governmental technical assistance is critical to thesuccess of most such projects. 1516Other Recommendations Regional transmission planning efforts need to be closely linked to the resource acquisition plans of load servingentities (LSE) and the plans of generators. States should take steps to coordinate their respectiveregulatory reviews of multi-state transmission projects ina manner that builds upon existing regulatory principlesand respects the public interest of individual states. States and federal regulators should extend a rebuttablepresumption of prudence for multi-state project proposalsthat have been endorsed as an economically efficientinvestment, based on a detailed economic assessment bya regional planning entity. Support of future research on turbine design, wind farmlayout features, animal vision, hearing and other senseswill yield additional information on how to reduce wind-farm risk to birds and bats. States should establish a working group of their agenciesconcerned with energy resources, including, but not limitedto, representatives from the Governor's office, energyoffice, state siting authority, fish and wildlife agencies andpublic utility commission. The goal of the group wouldbe to ensure the actions taken by each agency are con-sistent with state energy policy on energy resources andcoordinated consistently between the agencies. Reforms in the utility regulation and planning area should:(1) account for natural gas price risk in assessing resource options; (2) provide rate of return incentives for power purchase of renewable contracts; and (3) result in policies that include renewable energy in future cap-and-trade programs via state implementa-tion of such programs, channel a portion of funds fromviolations of environmental laws to renewable energy,such as through supplemental environmental proj-ects, and include renewable energy as a control meas-ure in State Implementation Plans (SIP). Discussion of the Recommendations Technical Feasibility: The Wind Task Force finds all the recommendations technically feasible.Cost: The two-year extension of the federal Production Tax Credit for all renewable energy fuels enacted by Congress in2005 is estimated to cost $3.2 billion. Other recommenda-tions will lower costs, such as the implementation of conditional-firm transmission service to more fully utilize theexisting transmission system. More importantly, the taskforce believes the recommendations will lower the cost ofwind generation to the point that it may be the lowest-costgenerating resource in the West, when considering totalcosts, including environmental impacts. This will result insignificant savings for Western electricity consumers.Additionally, large scale deployment of wind (as with othernon-gas-fired generation) will put downward pressure onnatural gas prices that will benefit consumers. Generation of electricity from wind has no national energy security costs.APPENDIX B - Energy Efficiency The Energy Efficiency Task Force's recommendations are divided into two categories: (1) state-level initiatives, and (2) regional initiatives. While most of our recommendationspertain to actions states can take on their own, we believethere are some important opportunities for advancing moreefficient use of energy in a coordinated way throughout theregion. Their specific recommendations are highlighted inbold type below (Please note that \"We\" refers to the EnergyEfficiency Task Force and does not imply endorsement bythe CDEAC or the Western Governors' Association) A. State-Level Initiatives 1. Electric Utility Demand-side Management (DSM) Programs We recommend that all Western states require utilities to integrate cost-effective energy efficiency optionsinto resource planning and procurement decisionsand pursue energy efficiency whenever it is the leastcost resource option. Electricity distribution companiesin Western states should dedicate at least 2% of revenues to ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs, assuming that doing so is cost-effective. Western states should establish minimum energy savings requirements or targets, either separately or incombination with renewable energy requirements or targets. We recommend setting a goal of saving 3-5% of projected electricity sales in 2010 through DSM pro-grams, as long as this is cost-effective. We further recommend setting a goal of saving 10-15% of pro-jected sales from DSM programs by 2020. This level ofsavings we recommend decoupling of electricity salesand revenues so that reduced electricity sales do notadversely affect utility revenues and fixed cost recovery,in combination with the creation of performanceincentives that reward utilities for implementing effective DSM programs. 2. Gas Utility Demand-side Management (DSM) Programs We recommend that all Western states encourage or require gas utilities to integrate energy efficiencyresources into their resource planning and procure-ment decisions and pursue energy efficiency wheneverit is the lowest cost resource option. All Western statesshould establish ratepayer-funded natural gas energyefficiency programs. We recommend that gas utilities invest at least 1.5-2%of their revenues in energy efficiency programs, andstrive to save the equivalent of 0.5-1.0% of gas con- sumption per year, as long as this is cost-effective. We recommend decoupling of gas utility sales and revenues along with creating performance incentivesthat reward utilities for implementing effective gasDSM programs. 3. Building Energy Codes We recommend that Western states take the followingactions in order to realize the energy savings andother benefits offered by state-of-the-art buildingenergy codes: - For states with outdated (pre-2003) energy codes, adopt the 2004 International Energy ConservationCode. Also, consider adopting innovative features ofCalifornia's latest Title 24 building energy codes, suchas lighting efficiency requirements in new homes. - All states should update their energy codes regularly. A three-year cycle could be timed to coincide withrelease of the national model codes. - In home-rule states, either establish a statewide mandatory code or strongly encourage local jurisdic-tions to adopt and maintain state-of-the-art codes. - Implement code training and technical assistance for architects, builders, and local code inspectors. If thesesupport activities are sustained over time, builders,designers, and code officials can become allies ratherthan opponents of state-of-the-art building codes.Federal funding for this purpose may be available inthe future through a provision in the Energy PolicyAct of 2005. Establish a \"reach code\" for state-owned buildings todemonstrate the feasibility of not only achieving theminimum code requirements but exceeding them.This will encourage the use of advanced energy efficiency products and designs, and will also rewardthe states with the inherent benefits of more efficientbuildings. We recommend that Western states establish a regionalbuilding code collaborative 4. Appliance Efficiency Standards We recommend that California continue to adopt min-imum efficiency standards on products not coveredby the federal standards. In addition, we urge otherWestern states to replicate standards first adopted byCalifornia, as long as they are cost-effective and notincluded in federal standards. 5. Public Sector Initiatives We recommend that all Western states adopt \"best practices\"in public sector energy management including: - Establish goals for reducing energy intensity by 2% per year or greater in state buildings, track progresstowards the goals using a benchmarking system such1718as the U.S. EPA's Portfolio Manager, and encourage local governments to set similar goals; - Provide financial and technical assistance for implementation of energy savings projects in existingbuildings and facilities; - Use energy service companies (ESCO) and perform- ance contracting to implement efficiency projectswithout public sector capital investment; - Construct new buildings that are exemplary and surpass minimum energy code requirements by awide margin; - Purchase only ENERGY STAR-labeled equipment in categories where such products are designated. 6. Financial Incentives We recommend that other Western states considerproviding tax incentives to help stimulate greateradoption of energy efficiency measures. In particular,states may want to coordinate qualification levels with the newly adopted federal energy efficiency tax credits. Western states with growing severance tax revenueson fossil fuels production should consider using a por-tion of these revenues to offset the revenue loss fromtax credits on energy efficiency measures. 7. Pricing and Regulatory Policies We recommend decoupling utility revenues from salesand allowing utilities to keep a small percentage ofthe net economic benefits produced by their energyefficiency programs. In order to implement this policy,it is critical to carefully evaluate the energy savings,peak demand reductions and economic benefits ofDSM programs. We recommend that all Western states adopt invertedblock rates for electricity consumed by residential customers. We suggest that states consider adopting invertedblock rates for natural gas. 8. Education and Training We recommend continuing and, where needed,expanding energy efficiency education and trainingprograms at the state, local and/or regional levels. Inparticular, we suggest that states: - Partner with the U.S. EPA and DOE in promoting ENERGY STAR products, homes, commercial buildingsand industries; - Implement programs to train builders and contractors on proper heating and air conditioning sizing andinstallation; - Train commercial building energy and facility managers, for example, by making use of the successful building operator training and certification program developed in the Pacific Northwest (Putnam et al. 2002); - Train industrial energy and facility managers in techniques for improving the efficiency of theirsteam, process heat, pumping, compressed air, motorsand other systems, and partner with the U.S. DOE in doing so; and - Increase awareness of innovative energy efficiency measures, such as modern evaporative cooling systems, reflective roofing materials, sealing thermaldistribution systems and use of day-lighting. We recommend that K-12 school- and college-basedenergy education programs be part of this initiative. 9. Technology R&D and Transfer We recommend that all Western states initiate,continue and, where appropriate, expand programspromoting best practices in industrial energy manage-ment. In doing so, a commitment should be made todeliver targeted training and follow-up technical assistance, to the degree funding permits. In addition,states should encourage companies to set goals forenergy efficiency improvement and energy savings,and then track progress towards the goals. We recommend that Western states support energyefficiency R&D and technology transfer activities toincrease the commercialization and market penetrationof innovative energy efficiency technologies. B. Regional Initiatives 1. Creation of Additional Regional Market Transformation Organizations We recommend creating additional regional market- transformation organizations that would: - Promote ENERGY STAR products and programs at the regional level; - Train architects, builders, code officials and facility managers on energy efficiency practices, codes andcompliance options; - Develop and promote voluntary targets or standards for energy efficiency in the commercial and industrialsectors; - Coordinate regionally to train commercial and industrial energy managers, and promote \"best practices\" in energy management; and - Research, demonstrate and test innovative energy efficiency technologies or strategies. 2. Building Energy Codes Collaborative We recommend forming a regional building energycode collaborative. The collaborative could implementthe following activities: - Support code development and adoption, includingproviding analysis of technical and economic viability of innovative code elements. Barriers will be brokendown as relationships are developed with builders,designers, and code officials. - Support code implementation through training architects, builders, and code officials at the regionallevel. In some cases it makes sense to provide thistraining locally, but in other cases, it could be carriedout on a regional basis. Also, the regional collaborativecould offer to \"train the trainers.\" - Establish a process for code development agencies in the states to coordinate their activities. This willallow states to learn from each other's experiences.It can also be used as an incubator for developingrecommendations to submit into the national modelcode development process, carrying the weight of aconsiderable block of states and their code officials. - Establish a \"reach code\" for state and locally owned buildings to demonstrate the feasibility of exceedingcode requirements. This can be done taking intoaccount climatic characteristics at the regional level. - Support upgrading the HUD manufactured housing energy standards. These homes are outside thescope of state regulation, but they impact energyconsumption in the states. Governors shouldbecome involved in efforts to upgrade the strin-gency for this class of homes on the national level. 3. Coordinated Appliances Standards Advocacy We recommend that Western states advocate, as aregion, for stronger federal appliance efficiency standards where this is technically feasible and economically justified. 4. Quantification of Air Emissions Benefits We recommend that Western states create or utilize aregional working group to quantify the air emissionsbenefits of energy efficiency and renewable energyprograms and foster inclusion of such programs instate and regional air quality improvement plans.Strategies for implementation of this recommendationinclude: - Create a new or use an existing WGA working group to foster and implement this recommendation, or doso through the WRAP; - Develop new or use existing information to quantify potential emissions-reduction benefits in WesternStates from energy efficiency and renewable energyinitiatives; - Identify a matrix of federal (e.g., cap & trade) and state regulatory policies (e.g., SIPs, SBCs, RPSs) whereinclusion of emissions benefits from energy efficiencyand renewable energy efforts bolsters the rationalefor adopting these policies; and - Identify and showcase existing successful state efforts, such as the one in Texas, and those underwayor completed in Maryland and Louisiana.. 5. Inclusion of Energy Efficiency in Regional Transmission Planning We recommend that Western states collaborate to ensure that the potential for and effects of energy efficiency efforts are incorporated in regional transmis-sion planning. We recommend that the WGA convene a regionalplanning group similar to the New England DemandResponse Initiative (NEDRI) or the Mid-AtlanticDemand Response Initiative (MADRI). 6. Collaboration Among Native American Tribes We recommend that tribes work together to hire energy management professionals or contractors, trainexisting staff in energy management and/or share staffamong several tribes. 7. Reducing Barriers to Performance Contracting and Other Strategies forIncreasing Energy Efficiency in CommercialBuildings We recommend forming a working group that would develop a set of recommendations to overcome thebarriers to implementing greater energy efficiency incommercial and public buildings. Among the strategies the working group should consider are: - Setting energy-savings targets for existing commer- cial buildings; - Promoting benchmarking using guidelines developed by the U.S. EPA and refined by California; - Setting up building commissioning and retro- commissioning programs patterned after those operating in California, Texas and Utah; and - Adopting mechanisms that will increase performance contracting by both the private and public sectors. 1920APPENDIX C - Transmission To ensure adequate transmission for the region to tap its vast clean and diversified energy resources, WesternGovernors should adopt and take necessary steps to implement the following actions. The recommendations are grouped according to federal, regional, state and localentities and industries that would implement the recommendations. 1. FERC's ongoing review of its open access transmission policy under Order 888 provides an excellent venue tourge the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to makeneeded reforms. The Western Governors should engagethe Commission to make changes to its transmissionpolicies to: a. Promote a conditional-firm, priority non-firm and other transmission service products; b. Encourage transparent review and assessment of available transfer capability (ATC); c. Eliminate rate pancaking (i.e. access fees imposed on transmission customers contracting for service acrossmultiple control areas) in the transmission system in amanner that addresses concerns about financialimpacts during a transition, recovery of costs and costshifting; d. Promote control-area consolidation on a case-by-case basis, where an analysis finds that benefits exceed thecosts and there are no significant adverse impacts onreliability e. Encourage congestion management systems that allow access to least-cost generation within reliabilitysecurity constraints; f. Encourage common Web sites for Open Access Same Time Information Systems (OASIS) to facilitate transmis-sion transactions; g. FERC code of conduct rules should ensure that transmission planning processes include as muchinformation about future and existing resources aspossible. Given different industry interpretations ofcode-of-conduct rules, FERC should clarify the rule toallow transmission planners and resource planners of a vertically integrated utility to participate in joint discussions at transparent regional planning meetingsand state-approved resource planning and acquisitionprocesses.; and h. Request that FERC convene a technical conference to develop needed reforms of interconnection and transmission queuing processes. 2. The Western Governors should take an active leadership role to promote state and regional policies in collaborationwith state legislatures to: a. Ensure resources to enable state participation in regional transmission planning; b. Encourage the electric power industry to make the existing proactive, transparent interconnection-wideand sub-regional transmission planning processes apriority; c. Review, and if necessary, amend state laws to require PUCs and public power boards to consider regionaltransmission needs; d. Support the goal of a regional planning capability that can yield critical information for stakeholders and regulators to allow rigorous evaluation of large, long-term investments in transmission; e. Bring together stakeholders and forge solutions to regional transmission needs, cost allocation and sitingwhere Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO) orIndependent System Operators (ISO) do not exist, andensure state participation in such activities by existingRTOs/ISOs; f. Promote use of an open season process by project developers as a means of demonstrating demand forand value of new transmission projects, and expandproject participation; g. Urge FERC and PUCs to form joint panels on transmis- sion cost recovery that would explicitly consider risksand needs for incentives, such as forms of preapproval,higher rates of return on transmission investments, andquicker cost recovery of transmission investments; h. States should consider adopting funding mechanisms to support research, development and demonstrationof advanced technologies in the public interest; i. Urge transmission operators to develop workable agreements at seams between ISO and non-ISO systems to enable effective grid operations; j. Ensure that there are resources and political commit- ments to successfully implement the WGATransmission Permitting Protocol and the MidwestElectric Transmission Protocol for new interstate transmission proposals; and k. Evaluate the option of forming an interstate compact for creation of a regional siting agency pursuant toSection 1221 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, andencourage consistent siting processes within theirstates through use of standardized applications, jointdata and studies, coordinated schedules and deadlinesand other mechanisms, where possible. 3. Western Governors should urge state public utility commissions to adopt policies and promote legislation,if necessary, to:a. Establish tiered standards of review for prudency and application of transmission incentives for transmissionexpansion costs featuring a lower standard for screeningstudies and planning, a moderate standard for permit-ting and the acquisition of rights-of-way, and a higherstandard for construction costs; b. For states with mandatory renewable portfolio stan- dards, regulatory commissions should make publicinterest findings associated with cost effective transmission projects that will enable states to attainenergy policy goals; c. Expand transmission in advance of generation to enable the modular development of location-con-strained, clean and diversified resource areas to meetcost-effective RPS, IRP and state goals, similar to recentTexas and Minnesota legislation for new transmissionand the renewable trunk line (Tehachapi) model fornew transmission; d. Coordinate multi-state review of transmission projects by developing common principles for cost allocationand cost recovery, and adopt a common Western procedural process that woul d identify and coordinate the applications, forms, analyses and deadlines; and e. Promote cost-effective transmission expansion by accommodating both non-dispatchable and dispatch-able resources. 4. Western Governors should collaborate with the appropriate federal agency to implement the EnergyPolicy Act provisions to designate energy corridors onfederal lands by: a. Committing state agency resources to participate in the federal effort and to identify contiguous corridorson adjacent state lands; b. Urging Congress to fund federal land management agency corridor planning efforts; and c. Fostering designation of corridors on lands not owned by the federal government or the states to ensure continuity in corridors. Designation and preservationof transmission corridors is important in rapidly urbanizing parts of the region. 5. Western Governors should encourage the Western electric power industry to: a. Synchronize regional transmission planning efforts to resource acquisition plans of load-serving entities (LSE)and plans of generators; b. Support and collaborate with state infrastructure authorities that have been created to facilitate trans-mission expansion; and c. Ensure institutional homes for regional transmission planning. APPENDIX D - CDEAC White Papers White paper submissions were received by the CDEAC on advanced natural gas, combined heat and power (CHP)and water energy. These white papers concern clean energyissues that went beyond the reports of the task forces chartered by the CDEAC, but nonetheless provide valuetowards meeting the clean energy goals of the WesternGovernors. The papers on Combined Heat and Power andWater Energy were developed under the guidance of theCDEAC and submitted for 30 days of public comment, butwere not subject to the same consensus building process asthe task force reports. The report on Advanced Natural Gasalso went through a public comment period, but wasreceived too late for the CDEAC to formally consider. It isposted as an information source on the WGA Web site at www ,westgov.org. Advanced Natural Gas Natural gas provides over half of the West's generating capacity and the CDEAC acknowledges that natural gas is an important part of the West's clean energy future. TheAdvanced Natural Gas Task Force was commissioned by theCDEAC in accord with the Governors' original resolution.Interest and participation within the task force proved to beunsubstantial. Nevertheless, a white paper has been submit-ted to address the very relevant issues of balancing supplyand demand to stabilize prices and ensure that natural gaswill remain an important part of the West's energy portfolio.While the CDEAC has not had an opportunity to discuss thiswhite paper, it is clear that the improvement of current infrastructure, consideration of liquid natural gas (LNG) as analternate supply, and continued installation of combinedcycle facilities are available options to help maintain stableprices in the future. The white paper sets forth a series ofrecommendations that can be found on the Web atwww .westgov.org. 2122Combined Heat and Power Combined heat and power is the simultaneous production of electric and thermal energy, which can create energy-useefficiencies that exceed 80%. Recovered heat energy fromCHP systems can be utilized in close proximity, practicalapplications, such as space heating, hot water, steam, air conditioning and product drying. The cross cutting natureof the distributed use of thermal and electric energy createsefficiency advantages that can be realized by many theresources covered by the task forces. CHP systems can create a reduction in water use, provide for conservation ofresources, avoid future emissions and decrease capitalexpenditures. The WGA currently has over 33,000 MW ofCHP capacity and the technical potential for an additional42,000 MW that can be tapped by considering the followingpolicy options: Adopt FERC's model interconnection standards, proceduresand agreements, and apply those to all interconnectionsin the state. Decouple utility revenues from throughput. Undertake a review of rates, especially standby rates, tomake sure they are not discriminatory toward CHP . Ensure that renewable portfolio standards and otherrenewable energy laws include the full range of renew-able CHP options, including waste heat recovery, spentpulping liquor and open-loop biomass. Water Energy Hydropower provides nearly 18% of the WGA's electrical generating capacity by utilizing the natural energy createdthrough the West's vast network of streams, rivers and coast-lines. A report published by the Idaho National Laboratoryidentified 30,000 MW of additional hydropower potential inthe United States; two-thirds of this potential is in the West.Ninety-eight percent of the dams in the United States donot have a power component attached to them, meaning asignificant hydro contribution to the West's future energyportfolio can be made without the construction of any newdams. Water-powered technology has also continued toadvance to include many non-conventional applications.Wave, tidal and in-stream capabilities present a tremendousopportunity to explore other technologies for capturingenergy from an abundant renewable source. Given the vary- ing degree of development among these different water energy technologies, Western states should approach theircontinued development through broad policy options thatcreate incentives, encourage research and development andstreamline permitting procedures: Support economic incentives for traditional, new andemerging hydropower technologies: 1. Extension of the federal Section 45 Production Tax Credit to 2015. 2. Expand production tax credits to include small hydropower, hydropower at non-hydro dams and hydro-kinetic / ocean technologies. 3. Include hydropower in state clean and renewable energy initiatives. Support Hydropower R&D funding - provide federal andstate financial support for the development of emerginghydrokinetic/ocean technologies and new turbineadvancements for traditional hydropower technology. Encourage regulatory flexibility to promote the develop-ment of small hydropower potential and related emerg-ing technologies.Acronyms ACTF - Advanced Coal Task Force ATC - Available transfer capabilityCDEAC - Clean and Diversified Energy Advisory CommitteeCFR - Code of Federal RegulationsCHP - Combined heat and powerCO2 - Carbon dioxideCSP - Concentrating solar powerDOE - U.S. Department of EnergyDSM - Demand Side ManagementEIA - Electricity Information Administration EOR - Enhanced oil recoveryEPA - U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyERCOT - Electric Reliability Council of TexasESCO - Energy service companyFERC - Federal Energy Regulatory Commission HUD - Housing and urban developmentIGCC - Integrated gasification combined cycleIRP - Integrated resource planIRS - Internal Revenue ISO - Independent system operatorkWh - Kilowatt-hourLNG - Liquid natural gasLSE - Load serving entitiesMADRI - Mid-Atlantic Demand Response InitiativeMW - MegawattMWh - Megawatt-hourNEDRI - New England Demand Response InitiativeOASIS - Open Access Same-Time Information SystemPMA - power marketing administrationsPPA - power purchasing agreementsPTC - Production tax creditPUC - Public utility commissionRD&D - Research, development, and demonstrationREC - Renewable energy creditRFP - Request for proposalsRPS - Renewable portfolio standardRTO - Regional transmission organizationSBC - System benefits chargeSIP - state implementation plansTWh - Terawatt-hourUSGS - U.S. Geological SurveyWGA - Western Governors' Association WRAP - Western Regional Air PartnershipWREGIS - Western Renewable Energy Generation Information SystemWestern Governors' Association 1515 Cleveland Place Suite 200 Denver, Colorado 80202 (303) 623-9378 www.westgov.orgWestern Governors' Association 1515 Cleveland "}
