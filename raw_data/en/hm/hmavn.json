Given the probable continuation of current economic condi- tions, as well as the need to continue to accelerate the academicdevelopment of the university, it is reasonable to expect that tui-tion and fee increases will be required each year in the near fu - ture.Tuition Undergraduate Students Full-time (12-17 credit hours) ......... $18,777 (Above 17 hours, $1,251 per additional credit hour)Part-time (per credit hour) ............1 , 2 5 1 Graduate Students Full- and part-time: (per credit hour) .......1 , 3 4 8 Graduate Business Program: 12 or more credit hours (per semester) .... $15,721 Fewer than 12 credit hours (per credit hour) . . . 1,201 Law Students (Above 17 hours, $1,578 per additional credit hour)Part-time (per credit hour) ............1 , 6 3 8 Nondegree Students Course level 100-400 (per credit hour) .....$ 1 , 2 5 1 Course level 500 and above (per credit hour). . . 1,348 Off-Campus Programs (per credit hour) ................ $ 1 , 1 3 5 Note: Auditors pay the same charges as students enrolled for credit and are subject to all applicable special fees.

Other correspondence should be sent to: American UniversityAU CentralAsbury 2014400 Massachusetts Ave NWWashington, DC 20016-8077 Advance Registration/Direct Registration Students registering during advance registration with billing for the semester must pay the balance due on or before the duedate as indicated on the bill. Students registering after the advance registration period (di- rect registration) must pay the balance due, less expected finan-cial aid, on the day they register. The American Guaranteed Tuition Single Payment Plan [Ameriplan] Available to incoming freshmen who do not receive any fi- nancial aid, this plan allows students to stabilize tuition expensesby prepaying four years' tuition at the entering academic yearrate. For more information call Associate Director of StudentAccounts Minh Phung at 202-885-3559. American Installment Plan The American Installment Plan (AIP) is available to all full-time students. This plan covers the academic year and re - quires ten monthly payments from June 1 through March 1, or twelve monthly payments from May 1 through April 1. Formore information, please contact AU Central ataucentral@american.edu . Late Payment and Financial Restrictions A finance charge may be assessed against a student's account for failure to meet the initial payment due date. The universitywill use a rate of 1 percent per month to compute the financecharge. The university figures the finance charge on the stu - dent's account by applying the 1 percent per month to the ad - justed balance of the student's account. In addition, failure to make payment when due will result in a financial \"restriction\" being placed on the student's account. Thefinancial restriction will result in a \"hold\" being placed on thestudent's academic records, including transcript and diploma,and may also result in denial of advance registration and use ofthe payment plan or other credit privileges.22 Tuition, Expenses, and Financial AidIf a student's courses are dropped due to nonpayment, a finan - cial restriction will be placed on his or her account. Restrictions may be removed following the reinstatement of all courses orig - inally dropped. To reinstate courses, the student must make ar - rangements with the Collections Office and pay the account in full (including a $100 reinstatement fee and all associated fi - nance charges). The university reserves the right to delay clear - ance until a personal check or e-check clears a financial institution. A student who has once had a financial restriction placed against his or her account may be denied future advance regis - tration and payment plan privileges even though the student has been reinstated upon payment of the reinstatement fee. Re - peated failure to make payments when due may result in sever - ance of the student's relationship with the university. Students who incur financial obligations in the parking and traffic office, library, health center, or athletic department maybe subject to late payment fees and financial restriction proce - dures. Students who fail to pay tuition or fees will be responsible for all costs of collection, including attorney's fees in the amount of15 percent of the balance due. Employer or Agency Tuition Assistance A student requesting employer or agency billing arrange- ments must furnish Student Accounts with a valid contract orpurchase order before the first day of classes. A contract or purchase order must contain the following in- formation: (1) student name and ID number, (2) term of atten-dance, (3) specific costs (and dollar amounts) to be paid by the sponsor (tuition, books, supplies, fees), (4) sponsor's billing address, and (5) contract or purchase order number or ac-counting appropriation, if applicable. Documentation submittedin lieu of a valid purchase order will not relieve a student of fi - nancial responsibility. In case of partial assistance, the student is required to pay the balance of his or her tuition costs at the time of registration in or - der to be considered registered. A student portion which quali - fies for one of the university payment plans is to be paid according to that plan. Failure to comply will result in the assess - ment of a 1 percent per month finance charge. (See Late Pay - ment and Financial Restrictions , above.) A student entitled to Campus Store credit may obtain a book voucher form from Student Acc ounts. Purchases are permitted through the end of the Add/Drop period. Failure to submit vouchers in a timely manner may result in the assessment of late fees. A student is responsible for paymentof any billed amounts which have been disallowed by his or hersponsor Employee Tuition Benefits Only full-time permanent faculty or staff employees of American University are eligible for tuition benefits. There is anonrefundable $50 registration fee each semester, in addition toany special course fees, and mandatory sport, technology, andactivity fees. Late registration f ees are not applicable to faculty and staff using employee tuition benefits. The Tuition Remission Application is available online at myau.american.edu . For more information, contact Human Resources at 202-885-2591. Refunds and Cancellation of Charges Course Drops Students who reduce their course load (except for full-time undergraduates maintaining 12 credit hours or more) by drop - ping courses during the refund period of the semester will have the course tuition cancellation calculated as of the date of thecourse drop. The student's account must show a credit balancebefore a refund will be processed. MBA modules and other courses on nonstandard schedules have different refund policies, percentages, and dates. In addi - tion, tuition and fee refund policies and deadlines for study abroad and other special programs may differ by program andlocation. Students should check with the appropriate office forspecific guidelines. Discontinuing attendance in class or notifying an instructor does not constitute an official course drop. Withdrawal Students who completely withdraw from the university must complete the appropriate withdrawal forms in consultation withtheir academic advisor and with Housing and Dining Program.The amount of tuition to be canceled will be calculated as of thedate which the withdrawal forms are received in the Office ofthe University Registrar and in accordance with the tuition can-cellation schedule, below. If the withdrawal results in a refund,the request for refund should be made through the student's por-tal or through AU Central. The student's account must show acredit balance before a refund will be processed. Discontinuing attendance in classes or notifying instructors does not constitute an official withdrawal. Students who do notofficially withdraw during the cancellation period by submittingthe appropriate forms to AU Central will be responsible for pay - ment of the full amount of the applicable tuition and fees. Tuition Cancellation Schedule The cancellation percentage is based on the date of the course drop or withdrawal:Drop/Withdrawal through the second calendar weeko f c l a s s e s.................... 100% Drop/Withdrawal through the third calendar weeko f c l a s s e s ..................... 5 0 %Drop/Withdrawal through the fourth calendar weeko f c l a s s e s ..................... 2 5 %Withdrawal after the fourth calendar weeko f c l a s s e s ................... NONE Note: the calendar week for cancellation of tuition ends on Fri - day (adjustments are made for legal holidays that fall within the first four weeks of the semester). Students should check the Aca - demic Calendar for specific dates for each semester.Tuition, Expenses, and Financial Aid 23Housing Requests for cancellation of room charges must be initiated by the student in writing to Housing and Dining Programs, An - derson Hall, by the withdrawal deadlines. The student must then request any applicable refund through their portal or with AUCentral. The cancellation percentage is based on the date ofwithdrawal:Withdrawal through the first calendar weeko f t h e s e m e s t e r .................. 7 5 %Withdrawal in the second calendar weeko f t h e s e m e s t e r .................. 5 0 %Withdrawal in the third calendar weeko f t h e s e m e s t e r .................. 2 5 %Withdrawal after the third calendar weeko f t h e s e m e s t e r ................. NONE Note: academic dismissal will result in a prorated charge for the weeks the student resided in university housing. Meal Plan Students will only be permitted to decrease or drop their meal plan during the first 15 days of the semester. Meal plan adjust - ments are made on a daily prorated basis, not by the number of meals used. Requests for meal plan cancellations must be initi-ated in person at one of the Housing and Dining Programs loca-tions, Rockwood Building or Anderson Hall. Students thenrequest any applicable refund through their portal or with AUCentral. Meal plan increases or sign-ups may be done at any time during the semester. Medical Withdrawal Policy No special waiver or refund of tuition and fees is made when a student discontinues attending classes due to medical reasons. However, when a student is hospitalized on an emergency basisand is therefore unable to formally withdraw from classes, theRegistrar is authorized to process a retroactive withdrawal basedon the last date that the student attended class. The student mustpresent evidence of his or her hospitalization and the date of lastattendance in class as verified by the instructor. Provided that theretroactive withdrawal date falls within the tuition cancellation period, the student's account will be adjusted accordingly. Tuition Refund Insurance The Tuition Refund Plan can minimize financial loss in - curred in a medical withdrawal from the university. This elective insurance plan provides coverage for tuition and housingcharges. The plan extends and enhances the university's pub - lished refund policy. To participate, applications and fees must be returned before the first day of fall semester classes. For spe-cific benefits and limitations, premium, and other information,contact the student health insurance coordinator at202-885-3298. Undergraduate Financial Aid American University awards financial aid to students based on a combination of demonstrated financial need, academicachievement, and the availability of funds. Once a student is ad - mitted to American University, the Financial Aid office will de - termine need and develop a financial aid award that includes funds from the programs for which the student qualifies. In addi - tion to awarding funds from American University, the university administers federal grant, loan, and work-study programs thatmay be included in the award. The financial aid award may in - clude a combination of an American University grant, federal grants, federally subsidized or unsubsidized loans and/or stu - dent employment. To receive consideration for financial aid, a student must be a United States citizen or eligible non-citizen in a degree program.New students should not wait to be admitted before filing theFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). A financialaid application has no bearing on a student's admission applica - tion.

Frequency of Monitoring Each student's academic progress is measured once yearly in June, after spring grades are posted. Financial Aid will notify inwriting students who are not making satisfactory progress. Academic Appeals All questions regarding the factual substance of academic re - cords and all requests for changes to those records must be made to the academic departments. The Academic Regulations de- scribe the petition process. Financial Aid has no authority to al - ter the academic record of a student. Re-Establishing Financial Aid Eligibility For a student who has failed to maintain satisfactory aca - demic progress, eligibility for financial aid funds may be re-established in a number of ways. Among these are: the peti - tioning process described in the Academic Regulations ;t h echanging of a grade; summer session attendance; and the com - pletion of incomplete or in progress courses. Please note that funds are not set aside for students in these circumstances. Evenif the appeal is granted, funds may not be available at that time. Financial Aid Appeals On occasion, a student may fail to maintain satisfactory prog - ress due to very serious circumstances that caused a major dis - ruption to that student's ability to successfully complete his or her course work. Students with mitigating circumstances must request reconsideration in writing to Financial Aidprior to July 1 . The request should include a comprehensive de - scription of the circumstances and documentation from at least two qualified persons who can verify the information. The Ap - peals Committee will review the appeal, make a recommenda - tion and send a letter of response to the student. Refund and Repayment Policy For American University's refund policies regarding tuition, housing and meal plan charges, see Refunds and Cancellation of Charges. The American University refund policy does not apply to first-time American University students. A \"first-time student\"is defined in Federal regulations as any student who has not at-tended at least one class at American University, or who re-ceived a full refund for previous attendance at AmericanUniversity. Federal (Title IV) Financial Aid Recipients Return of Title IV Funds Policy The Financial Aid Office is required by federal statute to re- calculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who with-draw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior tocompleting 60 percent of a payment period or term. The federalTitle IV financial aid programs must be recalculated in these sit - uations. If a student leaves the institution prior to completing 60 per - cent of a payment period or term, the Financial Aid Office recal - culates eligibility for Title IV funds. Recalculation is based on the percentage of earned aid using the following Federal Returnof Title IV funds formula: Percentage of payment period or term completed = the num - ber of days completed up to the withdrawal date divided by the total days in the payment period or term. (Any break of five daysor more is not counted as part of the days in the term.) This per - centage is also the percentage of earned aid. Funds are returned to the appropriate federal program based on the percentage of unearned aid using the following formula: Aid to be returned = (100 percent of the aid that could bedisbursed minus the percentage of earned aid) multiplied bythe total amount of aid that could have been disbursed duringthe payment period or term. If a student earned less aid than was disbursed, the institution would be required to return a portion of the funds and the studentwould be required to return a portion of the funds. When Title IVTuition, Expenses, and Financial Aid 25funds are returned, the student borrower may owe a debit bal - ance to the institution. If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to him or her, the institution would owe the student a post-withdrawal dis - bursement which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. The institution must return the amount of Title IVfunds for which it is responsible no later than 30 days after thedate of the determination of the date of the student's withdrawal. Refunds are allocated in the following order: /c183Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans /c183Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans /c183Unsubsidized Stafford Loans (other than PLUS Loans) /c183Subsidized Direct Stafford Loans /c183Federal Perkins Loans /c183Federal Parent (PLUS) Loans /c183Direct PLUS Loans /c183Federal Pell Grants for which a return of funds is required /c183Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grants for which areturn of funds is required /c183Other assistance under Title IV for which a return of fundsis required (e.g., LEAP) Scholarships Undergraduate University Scholarships The Admissions Committee makes all merit-based scholar- ship decisions and notifies students at the time they are admitted.Merit awards range from $3,000 to full tuition per year.

Refund and Repayment Policy For American University's refund policies regarding tuition, housing and meal plan charges, see Refunds and Cancellation of Charges. The American University refund policy does not apply to first-time American University students. A \"first-time student\"Tuition, Expenses, and Financial Aid 27is defined in Federal regulations as any student who has not at - tended at least one class at American University, or who re - ceived a full refund for previous attendance at American University. Federal (Title IV) Financial Aid Recipients Return of Title IV FundsPolicy The Financial Aid Office is required by federal statute to re - calculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who with - draw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior to completing 60 percent of a payment period or term. The federalTitle IV financial aid programs must be recalculated in these sit - uations. If a student leaves the institution prior to completing 60 per - cent of a payment period or term, the Financial Aid Office recal - culates eligibility for Title IV funds. Recalculation is based on the percentage of earned aid using the following Federal Returnof Title IV funds formula: Percentage of payment period or term completed = the num - ber of days completed up to the withdrawal date divided by the total days in the payment period or term. (Any break of five daysor more is not counted as part of the days in the term.) This per-centage is also the percentage of earned aid. Funds are returned to the appropriate federal program based on the percentage of unearned aid using the following formula: Aid to be returned = (100 percent of the aid that could bedisbursed minus the percentage of earned aid) multiplied bythe total amount of aid that could have been disbursed duringthe payment period or term. If a student earned less aid than was disbursed, the institution would be required to return a portion of the funds and the studentwould be required to return a portion of the funds. When Title IVfunds are returned, the student borrower may owe a debit bal - ance to the institution. If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to him or her, the institution would owe the student a post-withdrawal dis - bursement which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. The institution must return the amount of Title IVfunds for which it is responsible no later than 30 days after thedate of the determination of the date of the student's withdrawal. Refunds are allocated in the following order: /c183Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans /c183Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans /c183Unsubsidized Stafford Loans (other than PLUS Loans) /c183Subsidized Direct Stafford Loans /c183Federal Perkins Loans /c183Federal Parent (PLUS) Loans /c183Direct PLUS Loans /c183Federal Pell Grants for which a return of funds is required /c183Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grants for which areturn of funds is required /c183Other assistance under Title IV for which a return of fundsis required (e.g., LEAP)Federal Loans Graduate students who qualify for federal Stafford loans may borrow up to $18,500 every two semesters. All federal loan pro - grams require the FAFSAbe filed before eligibility can be deter - mined. To be eligible for federal need and non-need based loans, graduate students must be: /c183a U.S. citizen or permanent resident /c183enrolled in a degree-granting academic program /c183registered for at least 6 credit hours per semester Federal loans must be re-paid.

Opportunities exist withprivate businesses; local, state , and federal governments; and nonprofit, social service, and international organizations. Faculty from all university departments guide and evaluate students' experiential learning through academic internships.These experiences enable students to explore academic and ca - reer options, make career decisions, and prepare for entry into either an advanced degree program or the professional job mar - ket. Personal development, acquisition of independent learningskills, and a balanced education are other significant benefits to students participating in internships. Eligibility and Degree Credit for Academic Internships Opportunities are open to qualified degree-seeking under - graduate and graduate students. Applicants must be in good aca - demic standing and must obtain approval from appropriate academic advisors.

The numbers identify the level of the course as follows: 001-099 =no degree credit; 100-499 = undergraduate degree credit;500-599 = graduate courses to which advanced undergraduatestudents may be admitted; 600-799 = graduate courses to whichundergraduate students usually are not admitted. Credit Hour Value All undergraduate and graduate courses are valued in credit hours. Generally, each credit hour is equal to 50 minutes of classinstruction a week.42 RegistrationCourse Descriptions and Syllabuses Descriptions of permanent courses currently in the university curriculum are listed by course number in Course Descrip - tions . Catalog course descriptions, as well as selected and rotat - ing topics course descriptions are available each semester from t h eS c h e d u l eo fC l a s s e sa twww.american.edu/provost/registrar/schedule/index.cfm A syllabus describing the general nature and scope of each course is available from the department offering the course forthree years. Course Prerequisites Many courses call for a minimum background of knowledge, as indicated by prerequisite courses cited in individual descrip - tions. Titles and numbers are those of American University courses; equivalent courses satisfactorily completed at other ac - credited institutions also meet prerequisite requirements by transfer credit. Students are responsible for entering the class with the re - quired competence. Thus, prerequisites warn students of the knowledge they are to bring with them in order to meet the ex - pected standards of performance. Class Periods Day classes, except those on Wednesday and Saturday, ordi- narily meet two days a week for 75 minutes a meeting. Wednes-day classes ordinarily meet once a week for two hours and 30minutes. Some classes meet three times a week for 50 or 60 min-utes a meeting. Evening classes ordinarily meet once a week fortwo hours and 30 minutes or twice a week for 75 minutes a meet-ing. Classes at the 600- and 700-level may, in some cases, meetfor a total of two hours a week at the discretion of the teachingunit concerned. Courses involving laboratory, studio, discussion groups, or workshops may vary from these schedules. Independent readingcourses, study projects, internships, and similar kinds of studyopportunities meet according to the special arrangement withthe school, department, or faculty members concerned.Cancellation of Courses Occasionally it is necessary to cancel a scheduled course be - cause of low enrollment, the last-minute unavailability of an in - structor, or other unavoidable reasons. Every effort is made to announce the cancellation before the first class meeting, but thisis not always possible. If a course is canceled, a student whodoes not choose to transfer to another course may receive a fullrefund of the tuition and fees paid for the canceled course bycompleting a refund request form in the Office of Student Ac - counts. Class Attendance The university considers class attendance a matter best left to the discretion of the individual instructor. It is expected, how - ever, that faculty members who have a particular attendance policy will announce that policy at the first few class meetingseach semester. Veterans and others receiving government benefits are re - minded that the paying agency may have specific attendance policies. Emergency Cancellation of Classes Classes at American University are expected to meet accord - ing to the announced schedule and no instructor is authorized to change the day, hour, or place of any meeting. Unless cancella-tion of classes is announced publicly, classes will meet. Whencancellation of classes is necessary, instructors are expected toarrange for additional reading, study assignments, or class meet-ings to compensate for attendance time lost. Student Responsibility Students are responsible for their behavior, academic and otherwise, at American University. American University ex-pects that students, as mature members of the academic commu-nity, will adhere to the highest standards of personal andacademic integrity and good taste. To protect their academic status, students should seek the ap - propriate approval of their academic program advisors. It is highly recommended that students keep their own records of alltransactions with the university (grade reports, registrationschedules and changes, incomplete forms, etc.). It is also advisable to keep copies of all tests and papers sub - mitted in fulfillment of course work.Registration 43Academic Regulations /c183Academic Integrity Code /c183Student Academic Grievance Policy As part of providing a high-quality education, the university continuously examines its academic requirements. As a result,the information contained in this and other sections of this publi - cation may be revised. Students should consult their deans or de - partment chairs for any new requirements that may affect their individual programs of study. Academic Integrity Code Academic integrity stands at the heart of intellectual life. The academic community is bound by a fundamental trust that pro - fessors and students alike undertake and present their work hon - estly. As a community of the mind, we respect the work of others, paying our intellectual debts as we craft our own work. The Academic Integrity Code (\"Code\") for American Uni- versity defines honorable conduct, outlines attendant rights andresponsibilities, and describes procedures for handling allega-tions of academic misconduct. Violating standards of academicconduct is a serious matter subject to discipline. Most charges ofCode violations are brought by the university faculty to the Aca-demic Integrity Code Administrator of the major teaching unit(School or College) in which the course is taught. Violations adjudicated under the Code include the following: plagiarism; inappropriate dishonesty or take-home); dishonesty in papers; work done for one course and submitted to another; fabrication of data; in - terference with other students' or scholars' work; bribes, favors, and threats; and other academic misconduct. Violations of theCode will be treated seriously, with special attention to repeatoffenders. Sanctions for Code viol ations may include failure for the course, a notation on the student's permanent record, suspen - sion and dismissal, as well as other lesser sanctions. Freshman Forgiveness does not apply to Code violations. By enrolling at American University and then each semester when registering for classes, students acknowledge their com - mitment to the Code. As members of the academic community, students must become familiar with their rights and their respon - sibilities. In each course, they are responsible for knowing the requirements and restrictions regarding research and writing,examinations of whatever kind, collaborative work, the use ofstudy aids, the appropriateness of assistance, and other issues.Students are responsible for learning the conventions of docu - mentation and acknowledgment of sources. American Univer -sity expects students to complete all examinations, tests, papers, creative projects, and assignments of any kind according to thehighest ethical standards, as set forth either explicitly or implic - itly in this Code or by the direction of instructors. The Academic Integrity Code is incorporated in the university's Academic Regulations and may be found at:www.american.edu/provost/registr ar/regulations/reg80.cfm Student Academic Grievance Policy In the course of academic life, a student may come into dis - agreement with a faculty member or with the policies and ac- tions of an academic unit as they affect the student's progresstoward completion of a course or degree. In cases of complaintor disagreement over academic matters not resolved by consul-tation among the parties, the university provides the student theright to initiate a grievance procedure. Students should have protection through orderly procedures against prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation. At thesame time, they are responsible for maintaining standards of ac-ademic performance established for each course in which theyare enrolled. Evaluation of students and the awarding of creditmust be based on academic performance professionally judgedand not on matters irrelevant to that performance, such as per - sonality, physical disability, age, race, gender, sexual orienta - tion, religion, national origin, degree of political activism, or personal beliefs. Judgement regarding standards of evaluation for a student's academic performance is a faculty responsibility and is notgrievable. Normally, only questions relating to whether a facultymember complied with the stated requirements of the courseand applied standards of evaluation fairly and equitably are po - tentially grievable. Cases involving complaints about grades will be considered only when there is clear evidence that castssignificant doubt on the objectivity of the grading process or in - dicates that the faculty member failed to comply with the stated requirements of the course. The university's policy and procedures for consultation and informal resolution, formal process, and appeal for student aca - demic grievances may be found in Academic Regulation atwww.american.edu/provost/registrar/regulations/reg50.cfm 44Academic Regulations /c183Student Records /c183Grading System /c183Graduation /c183Undergraduate Academic Honors Student Records A file is maintained for each student who registers at Ameri - can University. Degree students' records begin in the Admis - sions Office, which assembles the application and supporting documents and the record of admission actions. After an appli - cant is approved for admission and registers, the academic his - tory is maintained by the Office of the University Registrar. Normally the only record maintained for nondegree studentswho are citizens of the United States are the record of their regis-tration(s) and their academic performance. A full record is keptfor each international nondegree student. The purpose of the official student record is to document the student's academic career and to provide a repository of infor-mation which can be useful to advisors. All relevant materialsare maintained until the student has received the degree or hasleft the university. Periodically, the basic materials in files aremicrofilmed and only the microfilmed copy and the electronicpermanent record, on which the summary of the total record isentered, are retained. Information needed for the continuing evaluation of the prog - ress of a student, grades earned, and the like are made available to the dean by the University Registrar. The various colleges,schools, and departments also develop files to aid in the counsel - ing and appraisal of their own students. Such files are not, how - ever, to be considered official. Important decisions relating to a student's academic career should always be based on the infor - mation maintained by the Office of the University Registrar. The alteration or misuse of official student records, or attempt to alter or misuse them, under any circumstances or for any pur - pose, will result in the peremptory dismissal of any student or employee of the university involved and the institution of suchlegal proceedings as may be appropriate. Confidentiality of Student Records The university's policy and procedures for confidentiality of student records may be found in Academic Regulation 90.10.00at www.american.edu/provost/registrar/regulations/reg90.cfm .The following explains the university's policy for complying with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974(\"FERPA\" or \"Act\"). Students at American University have thefollowing rights regarding their education records: 1) to have ac - cess to their education records, 2) to consent to release a record to a third party, 3) to request nondisclosure of directory informa - tion, 4) to seek amendment of information in an education re - cord which the student demonstrates is inaccurate, 5) to be notified of their privacy rights, and 6) to file complaints with theFamily Policy Compliance Offic e of the U.S. Department of Ed- ucation concerning alleged failures by American University tocomply with the Act. For purposes of this policy, the term \"student\" means any in- dividual who is attending or has attended American Universityand for whom the university maintains education records. Theterm \"education records\" or \"student education records\" means,with certain exceptions, any records 1) that are directly related toa student and 2) maintained by the university or its agents. Stu-dent education records are confidential and may only be re-leased with consent of the student or as otherwise permitted bylaw. The university does not maintain education records in one central office. Education records are maintained in the variousdepartments, schools, or college s. A student should contact the Office of the University Registrar, or, for law students, theWashington College of Law (WCL) Registrar, for guidance indetermining which unit(s) a student should contact about an ed - ucation record. Examples of academic and non-academic student education records include without limitation: /c183Academic Records: Permanent record of academic performance (e.g., transcript, including supportingdocuments) maintained by the Office of the UniversityRegistrar, the WCL Registrar, academic advisor, dean'soffice, and Provost's Office; files of progressmaintained by the school/college academicoffice and Provost's Office; admission files of students;Career Center files. /c183Non-Academic Records: Files related to Financial Aid,Housing and Dining Programs, International Student andScholar Services, Student Accounts, and the Library; 45student discipline files; employment files of students who are employed because of their student status (e.g.work-study, graduate assistantship/fellowship). Only information directly relevant to the educational pro - cesses of the university or which is voluntarily offered by the student and accepted from the student shall be included in stu - dent education records. Specifically excluded from such student education records are: /c183Medical and mental health information which is created, maintained, or used by a physician, psychiatrist,psychologist, or other recognized professional inconnection with treatment of the student and disclosed onlyto individuals providing the treatment. Such records arestrictly confidential and not accessible except as providedby applicable laws; /c183Sole possession records or private notes maintained byindividual faculty and instructional, supervisory, oradministrative personnel for their own use and which arenot accessible or released to anyone except a substitute; /c183Records created and maintained by Public Safety solely forlaw enforcement purposes; /c183Employment records of students which are made andmaintained in the normal course of business, relateexclusively to their employment, and are not available foruse for any other purpose; /c183Alumni records which contain only information aboutformer students after they are no longer students at theuniversity. Student Access to Student Education Records Each student may inspect his or her education record, subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. A studentmust submit a written request to review an education record.The request will be granted as soon as possible, but no later thanforty-five (45) days from the date of the receipt of the request. Atthe time of inspection, the student must present identificationand must inspect the records in the presence of a designated uni - versity official. In lieu of inspection and at the request of the stu - dent, the university may provide a copy of the requested education record. The student may be charged for the actualcosts of copying the records. The university reserves the right todeny requests for copies of records if there is an administrativerestriction on the individual's student account (e.g. financial ob - ligation, disciplinary stop). Student may not access the following education records: /c183Financial information submitted by parents; /c183Confidential letters of recommendation for which a student has waived the right of access provided that therecommendations are used only for their intended purpose(i.e. admission, employment, or consideration for anyhonor). However, the student may know the names of allpeople making recommendations; and/c183Confidential letters of recommendation placed in a recordbefore January 1, 1975, if the letters were used only for theintended purpose. Disclosures of Student Education Records At its discretion, the university may release directory infor - mation unless the student has file d a request for nondisclosure of directory information with the Office of the University Registraror, for law students, the WCL Registrar. Prior to releasing direc - tory information, the university official processing the request must contact the Office of the University Registrar to ensure thatthe student has not requested nondisclosure of directory infor - mation. Directory information i ncludes a student's name, tele - phone numbers, addresses, e-mail addresses, month and day of birth, dates of attendance at the university, major field of studyand class, date of graduation, degrees and honors received at theuniversity, participation in officially recognized university ac - tivities, height and weight of members of athletic teams, photo - graphs and similar information. At its discretion, the university may release directory infor - mation for persons requesting such information. In the event that the individual seeking verification provides incorrect or in - complete information, discretion will be exercised in the disclosure of this information. The university, in connectionwith specific events such as commencements, dean's list an-nouncements, scholarship presen tations, athletic contests, or other university-related news stories, may release directory in-formation to the news media or the public. The university mayrelease directory information for law enforcement purposes, andwill release directory information as required by law. Students who object to the disclosure of directory informa- tion must notify in writing the Office of the University Registraror, for law students, the WCL Registrar. Forms for this purposeare available from the Office of the University Registrar or theWCL Registrar and should be filed within thirty (30) days fol - lowing the first day of classes each fall and spring semester. The request for nondisclosure may be rescinded by written notifica - tion to the Office of the University Registrar or the WCL Regis - trar. In addition, the Registrar will notify students at the beginning of each fall and spring semester about the option to re - quest nondisclosure of their directory information. University officials are determined to have legitimate educa - tional interest if the information requested is necessary for that official to perform a task that is related to their normally as - signed job functions or related to their performance of a contract with the university. A\"university official\" includes faculty, staff,a member of the board of trustees, third-parties acting on behalfof the university, and individuals , including students, serving on university committees. The determination as to whether a legiti - mate educational interest exists will be made by the custodian of the records on a case-by-case basis.46 Academic RegulationsThird-Party Access to Education Records The university may disclose student education records with the prior written consent of the student. Astudent may authorizeaccess to third parties to review the student's education record bycompleting a written and dated authorization form which speci - fies the information to be released, the reasons for the release, and to whom the information is to be released. The university may disclose information in the following cir - cumstances without the prior written consent of the student: /c183To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. Unless otherwise directed by the order orsubpoena, the university will make a reasonable effort tonotify the student in writing of the order or subpoena inadvance of compliance; /c183To the parents of a dependent student, as defined in theInternal Revenue Code. The parent must sign, and provideto the university, a written statement confirming that thestudent is a dependent; the statement must be accompaniedby a copy of the parent's most current tax return whichreports the student as a dependent; /c183To persons or organizations provi ding the student financial aid, or who determine financial decisions concerningeligibility, amount, conditions, and enforcement or terms ofthe financial aid; /c183To organizations conducting studies for educationalagencies to 1) develop, validate, or administer predictivetests, 2) administer student aid programs; or 3) improveinstruction. Disclosure under this paragraph shall only bemade if the study is conducted in a manner that does notpermit personal identification of students by individualsother than representatives of the organization and thatpersonally identifiable data will be destroyed when nolonger needed for the purpose for which it was collected; /c183To authorized representatives of the Comptroller General ofthe United States; Secretary of Education; or state and localeducational authorities to audit or evaluate a federal or statesupported education programs, or for the enforcement of orcompliance with legal requirements of those programs.Disclosure under this paragraph shall only be made ifinformation is protected in a manner that does not permitpersonal identification of students by individuals other thanthe specified officials and that personally identifiable datawill be destroyed when no longer needed for the purpose forwhich it is collected. /c183To accrediting organizations for purposes related toaccreditation of the university; /c183To appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency; /c183To victims of crimes of violence or non-forcible sexoffenses concerning the results of disciplinary proceedingsabout those incidents; /c183To appropriate parties as permitted by the university'sParental Notification of Disciplinary Violations Involvingthe Use or Possession of Alcohol or a Controlled Substance;and/c183To appropriate parties in other circumstances as required bylaw. Education records will only be disclosed to third parties if they are advised not to redisclose the information to others with - out the prior written consent of the student or as permitted by law. Each university office must maintain a list of all individuals or organizations who have obtained access to a student's record.The list must indicate the legitimate interest that each person ororganization has in obtaining the information. This \"record ofaccess\" is part of the student's education record. A record of ac - cess is not necessary for disclosures: 1) to the student, 2) pursu - ant to a written authorization from a student, 3) to university officials, 4) of directory information, and 5) in response to a sub - poena or court order specifying that the existence and/or con - tents of such documents may not be revealed. Student's Right to Challenge Information in the Student Education Record If a student demonstrates that the student's education record is inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of the student'sprivacy rights, the student may request in writing that the recordbe changed. The request should be made directly to the custo-dian of the record. Any disagreement should be resolved infor-mally, if possible and within a reasonable time period. If therequest is denied, the student may file a written appeal within 30days to the University Registrar or, for law students, the WCLRegistrar. The Registrar will appoint a hearing committee to re-view the complaint. The committee will provide the student afull and fair opportunity to present evidence. The student maybe assisted or represented by one or more individuals of the stu-dent's choice, including an attorney. After the committee com-pletes the proceeding and makes findings, it will render a writtendecision and forward it to the relevant parties for implementa - tion. Students, dissatisfied with the results of a hearing, may place an explanatory statement in the relevant education record com - menting upon the information in dispute, and/or setting forth any reason for disagreement with the institutional decision notto correct or amend the record. Such a statement will becomepart of the student education record. Inactivity of Student Education Records After five years since the student has graduated or was last registered at the university, the university generally destroys stu - dent education records. Exceptions include but are not limited to the following: permanent records of academic performance, in - cluding supporting documents; such financial records as are necessary so long as there exists a financial obligation to the uni - versity; and disciplinary records that involve a permanent nota - tion to the student's record.Academic Regulations 47Transcripts Students may obtain transcripts of their academic records from the Office of the Registrar. Transcripts will be releasedonly on the signed request or rel ease of the student concerned. The university will not issue a transcript that reflects only a part of the student's record, nor will it make copies of transcriptson file from other colleges and universities. Certification of Enrollment AU Central supplies, on request of a currently enrolled stu - dent, certification of certain academic data concerning the re - cords and status of the student. These certifications are used for Department of Education and sc holarship forms, employment applications, and so forth. They are not to be confused with tran - scripts of the student's permanent academic record.

Coursesbelow the 100-level or taken pass/fail are not included in thegrade point average, nor are grades of Incomplete (I). See also Repetition of Courses, below. Credit accepted for transfer from another institution is in - cluded in the total amount of credit applicable to degree require - ments, but grades earned in such courses are not recorded on thepermanent record at American University and are not used in computing the cumulative grade point average needed for grad - uation. Pass/Fail For undergraduate students, the grade of P indicates a quality of performance no less than C (2.00) on a conventional gradingscale. For graduate students, the grade of P indicates perfor - mance equivalent to a B (3.00) or better on a conventional grad - ing scale. Performance below these levels is reported as ZF. Neither the Pgrade nor the ZF or ZX grade is calculated in the grade point average. Degree credit, however, is received withthe grade of P. Incomplete Grades At the discretion of the faculty member, the grade of I (In - complete) may be given to a student who, because of extenuat - ing circumstances, is unable to complete the course during a semester. The grade of Incomplete may be given only if the stu - dent is receiving a passing grade for the course work completed. Arrangements for a grade of Incomplete must be made in ad - vance of the final examination. An Incomplete Contract form detailing what work is to be submitted, the deadlines for suchsubmission, and a grade to be substituted for the I should sub-mission deadlines not be met is signed by both the student andthe faculty member. The submission deadline should not extendbeyond the last day of the following semester (not countingsummer). No grade of I will be recognized by the Office of the Registrar without the proper documentation. On completion of the re-quirements of the course within the time specified in the elec-tronic submission of the Incomplete, the grade of I must beresolved to a grade of A through F, P, or ZF. Unless resolved bythe faculty member to one of these grades, the default gradespecified in the electronic submission of the Incomplete will beinserted as a final grade in place of the I by the Office of the Reg - istrar. AW may not be given to remove a grade of I. An I may not stand as a permanent grade. Changes in Grades Once reported, a grade may not be changed except to remove a grade of I (Incomplete) as stated above, or to correct a grade re - corded in error. To remove a grade recorded incorrectly, the fac - ulty member must certify in writing to the Office of the Registrar that an error was made. Repetition of Courses Whenever a course is repeated, each attempt, including the fi - nal grade, is entered separately on the permanent academic re - cord. Unless specifically indicated to the contrary, however, only one successful attempt of a course is counted toward fulfill - ment of graduation credit requirements. With the exception of the Freshman Forgiveness rule (see the Undergraduate Studychapter in this publication), the grades received in all attemptsare considered in the computation of the undergraduate cumula - tive grade point average.48 Academic RegulationsGraduation Candidates for degrees submit an Application for Graduation form to AU Central during the registration period for their lastexpected term of study. Application forms are available at:myau.american.edu . Only after application for graduation has been made can the Office of the Registrar begin processing the necessary informa - tion for final certification of graduation. Students who fail to complete all degree requirements by the end of the term forwhich they applied to graduate must reapply in order to graduatelater. Conferral of Degrees and Commencement The university confers degrees and issues diplomas at the end of the fall, spring, and summer terms. Formal commencementceremonies are held in May.Only students who successfully complete degree require - ments by the end of the term for which they have applied (or re - applied) to graduate are certified for conferral of a degree. In witness of the degree conferred, the permanent records of thegraduates are appropriately noted with a statement of graduationand their diplomas are released. Candidates for degrees whose academic records indicate that they can satisfy degree requirements by the end of the term forwhich they have applied are permitted to participate in com - mencement ceremonies. Participation in a commencement cere - mony does not itself constitute conferral of a degree, nor does it imply an obligation on the part of the university to award a de - gree before all requirements have been met and certified.Academic Regulations 49Academic Regulations /c183Graduate Academic Standards and Degree Requirements It is university policy that no student shall be involuntarily subjected to regulations and academic requirements introducedduring the student's continuous enrollment in good standing in asingle degree program if the new regulations involve unduehardships or loss of academic credits earned to satisfy the re - quirements previously in effect. Graduate students are governed by the following minimum requirements for the graduate degree. Each teaching unit mayhave further requirements. Gr aduate students are advised to consult their own advisor, department chair, or dean for detailedinformation. Academic Load and Full-Time Status The normal load of full-time graduate study is 9 to 12 credit hours a semester; however, an academic unit may declare cir-cumstances under which full-time involvement in thesis or dis-sertation research constitutes full-time standing. In summer sessions, because of the combination of six-week and seven-week sessions, there are various possibilities forfull-time standing. Usually, registration for 6 credit hours duringany session is considered full-time. Academic Probation and Dismissal A graduate student who fails to maintain a 3.00 grade point average (on a 4.00 scale) after completion of the first 12 credithours of graduate study may be placed on academic probationfor one semester, after which the student must achieve and main - tain a 3.00 average or be dismi ssed. A graduate student may be placed on academic probation only once. It should be noted thatthe grade point average is only one measure of academic perfor - mance. Maintenance of the requi red average does not necessar - ily imply that a student is making satisfactory progress, and the university reserves the right to dismiss a student whose perfor - mance is judged unsatisfactory even though the student has maintained the required grade point average. A student who isdismissed may not be readmitted to the university or enroll as anondegree student for a full year after the effective date of thedismissal.Advancement to Candidacy Each academic unit may at its discretion require a formal ad - vancement to candidacy and determine the nature of the ad - vancement procedure it will use. Credit Hour and Residence Requirements Master's Degrees At least 30 credit hours of graduate work including (a) no less than 3 and no more than 6 credit hours of research resulting in athesis (thesis option) or (b) 6 credit hours of graduate work withgrades of B or better involving a case study, an in-service pro - ject, an original creative work, specified research courses, or such other effort as the academic unit may designate (nonthesisoption). At least 24 of these hours, including the thesis or nonthesis option, must be completed in residence at American University.Up to 12 credit hours taken in nondegree status at AmericanUniversity may be counted toward the degree, or up to 21 credithours if earned in a completed graduate certificate program. Graduate students may count a maximum of 6 credit hours of internship and cooperative education field experience towardtheir degree requirements. The field experience credit hours thatmay be counted toward the requirements for a degree programmay be fewer, as determined by the academic department, butmay not exceed the maximum of 6 credit hours. Graduate students may take graduate-level courses that meet with undergraduate-level courses. However, no more than 50percent of course work taken in residence (not counting thesis ordissertation seminars without regular meetings) may be taken injoint graduate-undergraduate courses. Doctoral Degrees For students admitted to graduate work at American Univer - sity without a previously earned master's degree, the require - ment is 72 credit hours of graduate study including no fewer than 6 and no more than 24 hours of directed study on the disser - tation. At least 42 of these hours, including the research require - ment, must be completed in residence at American University. Up to 12 credit hours taken in nondegree status at AmericanUniversity may be counted toward the degree, or up to 21 hoursif earned in a completed certificate program. Course creditearned toward a master's degree at American University may, ifrelevant, be counted toward the Ph.D. degree. For students admitted with a master's degree earned previ - ously, the requirement is at least 42 credit hours of additional graduate work, of which 36 hours, including the research re - 50quirement, must be completed in residence at American Univer - sity. Graduate students may count a maximum of 6 credit hours of internship and cooperative education field experience towardtheir degree requirements. The field experience credit hours thatmay be counted toward the requirements for a degree programmay be fewer, as determined by the academic department, butmay not exceed the maximum of 6 credit hours. Graduate students may take graduate-level courses that meet with undergraduate-level courses. However, no more than 50percent of course work taken in residence (not counting thesis ordissertation seminars without regular meetings) may be taken injoint graduate-undergraduate courses. All But Dissertation Master's Students who enter a doctoral program without a master's de - gree may be awarded the appropriate master's degree by Ameri - can University in the field in which their doctoral work is being done when they have completed all requirements for the doctor - ate except the dissertation. Combined Bachelor's and Master's Degrees American University offers students the opportunity to earn both undergraduate and graduate degrees through its acceleratedbachelor's/master's programs. Students can choose from a widevariety of established bachelor's/master's programs, or they cancreate bachelor's/master's programs with the approval of the ac-ademic department supervising the graduate-level work. Stu-dents may complete graduate degrees in disciplines differentthan their undergraduate degrees, provided they are admitted tothe master's program by the supervising department and theyhave completed the prerequisites required for the graduateprogram. A student admitted to a combined bachelor's/master's pro - gram (involving tentative admi ssion to graduate standing, so that both a bachelor's and master's degree may be earned as theresult of a planned program of study) must follow a prescribedprogram of work, and the student's record must show whichcourses will be applied toward the undergraduate degree andwhich courses will be applied toward the master's degree. Once admitted to a combined bach elor's/master's program, a student may not be denied entry into that master's program if thatstudent completes the bachelor's program in good standing andmeets university and teaching unit minimum standards for ad - mission to the master's program involved. Students will be admitted to the combined program at two levels, once for the undergraduate degree and once for the grad - uate degree. Each school sets its own admission standards and procedures. Tuition and fees will be paid on the basis of the levelat which the student is currently registered. When the studenthas completed the requirements for a bachelor's degree and hasbeen admitted to the graduate portion of the program, tuition andfees will be charged at the graduate rate.The undergraduate student may complete up to 3 credits for every 9 credits required for the graduate degree that may be ap - plied to the requirements for both degree programs. For exam - ple, a student may share up to 9 credits for a 30-hour master's degree and up to 12 credits for a 36-hour master's degree.Charges will be at the undergraduate rate. The department thatoversees the graduate program the student enters will determineif the courses the undergraduate student completes will satisfymaster's degree requirements. Departments are not required to accept courses that the student completes while he or she is anundergraduate. In addition to these shared credits, undergraduate students in a bachelor's/master's program ma y be able to reserve a particular course so that it counts only toward the master's degree require - ments This reserved course work will not count toward the bachelor's degree. Any reserved courses do not affect the stu - dent's undergraduate G.P.A., nor do the credits count toward a student's full-time enrollment status in a given term. The stu - dent's official university transcript will note which courses are reserved for graduate credit only. Students are required to complete the graduation application and clearance process once for the bachelor's degree and oncefor the master's degree. Bachelor's/master's students m ust complete at least 18 in-res- idence credit hours at the graduate level after the bachelor's de-gree is earned. This represents a reduction from the establishedrequirement of 24 credit hours of in -residence credit for master's students. Bachelor's/master's students must maintain continu-ous, sequential enrollment in the two programs. Students mustfinish the master's degree requirements within three years fromthe date of first enrollment in the master's program. Examinations Master's Degrees At least one comprehensive examination, the nature and scope of which are determined by the academic unit, is required. An oral examination on the thesis may be required by the aca - demic unit. Doctoral Degrees At least four comprehensive examinations are required, at least one of which must be oral. At least two of the comprehen - sive examinations must be written and must be taken within one year following the completion of the residence requirement. Aqualifying examination and master's comprehensive examina - tion, if taken at American University, may, at the discretion of the academic unit, be credited toward the comprehensive re - quirements for a doctoral degr ee. Comprehensive examinations given by other institutions will not be credited toward the satis - faction of degree requirements. An oral examination on the dissertation is also required. Examination Timetable For both master's and doctoral degree students, the dean or department chair (or designated r epresentative) determines theAcademic Regulations 51time and eligibility for taking the comprehensive, tool, and (where required) oral examinations. Application to take comprehensive examinations is made to the academic unit on a standard form available from that office.After approval is obtained, the student pays the appropriate feeto Student Accounts. In most cases, students should plan to ap - ply during the first week of classes of the semester in which they plan to take the examinations. Examination Fields Each college, school, or department offers its current list of standard comprehensive examination fields, including certain\"core\" fields and areas in which candidates in particular degreeprograms must present themselves for examination. In somedisciplines it may be possible to choose an available field out - side the major area of study. Examination Grading Usually each comprehensive written examination is read by two readers and is rated \"distinction,\" \"satisfactory,\" or \"unsat - isfactory\" by each. In order to pass the examination, the candi - date must obtain at least \"satisfactory\" from both readers in each of the examination fields. In the event of a disagreement in theratings between readers as to whether or not the candidateshould pass, a third reader is appointed to break the deadlock.Each dean or department chair may, however, elect to determinea different system of grading comprehensive examinations. Stu-dents should consult the specific college, school, or departmentto ascertain what system is used. Re-examination Comprehensive Examination: A student who fails a com- prehensive examination (other than a qualifying examination)may be permitted additional attempts within two years. The na-ture and extent of the examination to be retaken and the numberof retakes allowed will be determined by the academic unit.Teaching units may establish their own rules for retaking quali - fying examinations. Thesis and Dissertation Oral Examinations: In the event of failure to complete the oral examination satisfactorily, the ac - ademic unit may, at its discretion, permit one retake. Grade Point Average Students enrolled in a graduate program must maintain a cu - mulative grade point average of at least 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in order to remain in good standing and to graduate. The calcula - tion of the graduate cumulative grade point average is specific to the program in which a student is enrolled. Only graduate-levelAmerican University courses that are accepted by the de - gree-conferring teaching unit as fulfilling degree requirements are included in the cumulative grade point average. Minimum Grades No degree credit is earned by a graduate student for any grade lower than C (2.00 on a 4.00 scale) received in a graduate-levelcourse. However, grades lower than C are used in calculating thegrade point average.Prerequisite Undergraduate Credit Credit earned in undergraduate courses taken as required pre - requisites for other courses by graduate students may not be counted toward satisfying the total credit requirement for a grad - uate degree, and grades earned in such courses are not used in calculating the student's grade point average. Interdisciplinary Studies Graduate students who want to pursue an M.A. or M.S. inter - disciplinary degree must first be admitted to a school or college. In applying for admission, the prospective graduate studentshould alert the faculty of the teaching unit of his or her interdis - ciplinary goals. The initiative in formulating an interdisciplinary major is left to the student. The student is responsible for secur - ing the advice and approval of three faculty advisors, at least one from each of the two or more disciplines involved in the interdis - ciplinary field, who will help in setting up the program. The stu - dent should select one of the three faculty advisors as the primary advisor who must be from the admitting school. Thestudent, with the assistance of the faculty advisors, must formu - late in writing and submit to the office of the dean the following items in the approved format and bearing the signatures of allthree faculty members: 1. A statement of the central concept around which the interdis-ciplinary major is organized.2. An explanation of why existing programs are inadequate tothe student's purpose.3. Alist of all proposed courses\u2014major, related, and tool\u2014withprerequisites to these course s. Individually designed courses must be outlined by the student, after consultation with the fac-ulty member.4. A rationale for the selection of courses.5. The title of each standardized comprehensive field, with a ra - tionale for selecting it. 6. A statement of how the 6-hour research requirement is to befulfilled. If the research requirement is not to be met by a thesis,specifics of the nonthesis option must be listed. If the choice is towrite a thesis, the thesis proposal and names of thesis committeemembers must be specified.7. The title of the interdisciplinary program and whether anM.A. or M.S. degree is to be awarded upon successful comple - tion of the program. Ameeting of all three faculty advisors, the student, and a rep - resentative of the dean's office must be held before final ap - proval of the major program. Approval or disapproval of an interdisciplinary major will be given by the dean's office withinfour weeks of receiving the proposal. In accepting the proposal,the dean's office certifies that the rules established for interdisci - plinary studies have been followed and that courses necessary for completion of the program will be available, and it assumesadministrative responsibility for monitoring the student's prog - ress and clearing the student for graduation.52 Academic RegulationsLeave of Absence If a student is unable to pursue course work or to work with faculty for a fall or spring semester, the dean of the student'steaching unit may authorize a leave of absence for one or two se - mesters, during which the student's enrollment status in the de - gree program would be maintained. During a leave of absence, the student is not entitled to use the services of the university.Time limitations for completing graduate degrees continue toapply during periods when students are on leaves of absence.Students may petition for an extension of candidacy at the timethey apply for a leave or at a later time. Procedures for grantingleaves of absence may vary among schools and colleges. A graduate student taking a leave of absence because of mili - tary or government assignment required as a direct result of hos - tilities or war, or for incarceration resulting from refusal to accept induction under such circumstances, may receive a tui - tion refund and have other charges prorated on the basis of the number of weeks during which the student was registered forclasses in a given semester. If a student has completed at least tenweeks of a session, he or she may be given full credit for anycourse, subject to the approval of the instructor and departmentchair. Additional work may be required. No tuition refund willbe given for courses for which credit was given. A student whose studies are interrupted for the reasons stated above may resume study at Ameri can University in the same de- gree program, provided he or she returns within a period of sixmonths following the completion of duties and provided that thedegree program in which the student was enrolled is still offered.A student who wishes to be enrolled in a different degree pro-gram must apply for readmission. Maintaining Matriculation Graduate students whose degree requirements are not com - pleted and who have not been granted a leave of absence must register each fall and spring semester during regular registrationperiods for courses, for thesis or dissertation seminars, or formaintaining matriculation. Those who do not will be consideredas having withdrawn. Such students may then reapply and, if re - admitted, are governed by requirements and regulations in effect at the time of readmission. During a semester when a student is not enrolled in credit course work but is utilizing the services of the university (e.g., toprepare for comprehensive examinations or complete researchfor the thesis or dissertation), the student maintains enrolled sta - tus by registering for maintaining matriculation, the equivalent of one graduate-level credit hour. Schools and departments mayestablish specific requirements as to when and for how many se - mesters students may be in maintaining matriculation status. Students who change degree objective, college, or school, whose candidacy for an advanced degree expires, or whochoose to conform to new regulations or requirements must beprepared to complete all requirements and abide by all regula - tions in effect at the time such a change is made.Statute of Limitations Candidates for a master's degree must complete all degree re - quirements no later than three years after the date of first enroll - ment in the degree program, except for the M.B.A. degree, which must be completed within four years. Candidates for thedoctoral degree must complete all degree requirements no laterthan five years after the date of first enrollment in the doctoralprogram, or seven years if the doctoral program was entered di - rectly from a bachelor's degree. A student may petition for an extension of candidacy in a de - gree program for a limited period if such extension is sought be - fore these time limits expire. I n no case may the total amount of time granted in extensions of candidacy exceed three years. If,however, the time limit has expired, a student may seek readmis - sion to the university for a period of no more than three years, less any time granted in previous extensions of candidacy. Readmission to an advanced degree program may involve completing additional courses or other appropriate work. Anydegree calling for additional undergraduate prerequisite courseshas the statute of limitations extended for the amount of time re - quired to complete them. Study at Another Institution Once matriculated at American University, a graduate stu- dent, may be granted approval to take a maximum of 6 credithours of graduate courses as transfer credit from another accred-ited institution. The student must secure advance approval fromhis or her advisor and dean for specific graduate courses by com-pleting the Graduate Permit to Study at Another U.S. Institutionform. Graduate students on a Permit to Study for the fall orspring terms must maintain matriculation by registering for atleast one graduate credit hour at Am erican University. Master's degree students must complete a minimum of 24 credit hours inresidence. Doctoral students must complete a minimum of 42credit hours in residence. Transfer credit from a Permit to Study is accepted for courses with earned grades of B or better. Grades for transferred coursesare not recorded on the American University permanent recordor computed in the student's grade point average. Theses and Dissertations Thesis and Nonthesis Options For master's candidates, the thesis is expected to demonstrate the student's capacity to do original, independent research.Some colleges, schools, and departments offer the opportunityto substitute a case study, an in-service project, an original cre - ative work, or specific advanced research courses in lieu of a thesis. In each such case, the thesis seminar or other accepted al - ternative must be considered part of the residence requirement for the master's degree and must meet the standards of the indi - vidual college, school, and department as well as those of the university.Academic Regulations 53No academic credit is given for the master's thesis unless the student registers for the thesis seminar. However, a studentshould not enroll for this seminar until ready to start work on theformal thesis proposal or the thesis itself. Traditionally, an advi - sory committee is appointed for each candidate working on a thesis. The committee may be composed of no fewer than twomembers, at least one of whom must be a member of thefull-time faculty. An oral examination by this committee is oftenrequired. Suggestions for revision may be made as conditionsthat must be met before members will sign the title page of thethesis. If the chair of the thesis committee or the departmentchair certifies failure to complete a satisfactory thesis, the stu - dent may be dismissed from the university. A student who writes a thesis must adhere to the required form and content for the proposal and to the other procedures de - scribed in detail in the published guides that may be obtained from the office of the dean of the college or school. Students electing the nonthesis option should consult the in - dividual program descriptions and obtain specific departmental requirements from their teaching units. The university mini - mum requirement is two research-oriented courses. These courses must be completed with grades of B or better. Dissertation Capping the requirements for the doctorate is the dissertation, together with the required oral examination of the dissertationby the student's teaching unit. Normally, the candidate musthave completed all other academic requirements for the degreebefore the oral examination can be held. A candidate who is declared ready to proceed to the disserta- tion must submit a dissertation topic proposal reporting the re-sults of preliminary research. This proposal should contain,among other things, a concise statement of the major problem ofresearch and of related supporting problems, the data to be used,a selected bibliography, a statement of the probable value or im - portance of the study, a brief description of the methods to be used, and a preliminary outline of the dissertation in some detail. After approval of the proposal by the candidate's advisor, it is presented to the dean of the college or school for final approval.Acceptance of the proposal indicates that the topic is a suitable oneand that the dissertation will be accepted if developed adequatelyby the candidate. The university will take responsibility for direct - ing research only in fields and problem areas that its faculty mem - bers feel competent to handle. Acceptance of a dissertation topic proposal under no circumstance commits any department orschool or the university to accept the dissertation itself. A dissertation advisory committee of three to five persons is usually appointed by the candidate's academic dean for eachcandidate undertaking a dissertation. After the draft manuscripthas received the tentative approval of all members of the com - mittee, the committee chair arranges for the oral examination. This covers the dissertation itself and the general field of study.Conditions to be met before final acceptance of the dissertationmay be specified without necessarily holding a second oral ex - amination.Thesis or Dissertation Progress It is the collective responsibility of the student, the student's advisor, and the student's committee to ensure that satisfactoryprogress is being made on the student's thesis or dissertation.The student may request, at least once each semester, that thecommittee meet with him or her to discuss progress. Final Manuscript Candidates are responsible for being familiar with and com - plying with the regulations concerning the form and preparation of the final manuscript, abstract, copyright, and so forth, whichmay be obtained from the dean or department chair of the teach - ing unit offering the doctorate. Deadlines are published in the Academic Calendar. These must be met if a candidate expects toreceive a degree at the appropriate commencement. Filing of Thesis or Dissertation On completion of the final manuscript, a student obtains the sig - nature of the department chair and dean on the Thesis/Dissertation Completion form, and takes the form and the manuscript to StudentAccounts to pay the fee. This fee is required for entering into themandatory agreement with University Microfilms. Every thesis anddissertation must be microfilmed. The student contacts the Office ofthe Registrar for certification of the completion of degree require-ments, and then proceeds to the library for filing of the manuscript.This procedure is to be followed after all other requirements for thedegree have been satisfied. Publication It is the policy of the university to encourage publication of dissertations, case studies, a nd theses, with acknowledgment to the university. If substantial alterations are made before publica-tion, this fact must be noted in the prefatory statement that givesacknowledgment. Tools of Research Each academic unit specifies the tool of research require - ment. Tools should relate to research in the student's discipline. The student's satisfaction of tool requirements is certified by theteaching unit, but aid in ascertaining this may be sought outsidethe unit. Transfer of Credit The university is liberal in accepting credit earned in the past. Nonetheless, a student who has not been engaged in formalstudy for a number of years or whose study has been intermit - tent, at American University or elsewhere, must understand that full credit will not necessarily be granted for past work simplybecause it is a matter of record. The evaluation of graduate work completed elsewhere by an entering graduate student, in terms of its applicability to the pro - gram at American University, will be made by the office of the dean or department chair concerned no later than the completionof 12 credit hours of course work at American University. Up to 6 credit hours earned at another institution may be ap - p l i e dt oam a s t e r ' sd e g r e e .U pt o3 6c r e d i th o u r se a r n e da ta n - other institution may be applied to a doctoral degree, including54 Academic Regulations30 credit hours for a master's degree earned at another institu - tion and 6 credit hours beyond the master's degree. For transfer credit, individual courses (that is, courses not part of a completed master's program) must have been completedwith grades of B or better and must have been completed withinseven years of the beginning of the semester for which the stu - dent is admitted to degree status at American University. In no case may graduate credit be given for course work designated asundergraduate by the offering institution. See also Credit Hour and Residence Requirements ,o r consult the individual department for further details. Transfer of Credit from One American University Advanced Degree to Another A student may transfer 6 credit hours from one master's de - gree earned at American University to another master's degree to be completed at American University (see the dual master'sdegrees option, below, for two master's degrees earned simulta - neously). Astudent pursuing a second doctoral degree at Ameri - can University may transfer a total of 36 credit hours from one doctoral degree to another. However, the student must completean additional 36 credit hours of graduate work in residence inthat new doctoral degree program. In all cases students are required to meet the residency re- quirements established by the university and any further resi-dency requirements which may be stipulated for each programby the individual departments. Dual Master's Degrees Option In the case of simultaneous approved registration in two mas- ter's degree programs, additional courses may be counted to-ward both degrees. The student must meet the admission criteria for each of the degrees and must be admitted separately to eachdegree program. The student must be admitted to the secondprogram before completing the first. Admission to one degreeprogram does not guarantee automatic admission to a second;each admission decision is separate and conducted according toestablished procedures for the particular degree. All the course and other requirements for each degree pro - gram must be met, including the thesis or non-thesis research option for each degree. Students must complete at least 48 credithours in residence at American Un iversity with at least 24 cred - its unique to each degree. Individual departmental requirements may demand more than 24 credit hours for either or both de - grees. Courses used to satisfy requirements for an undergraduate degree may not also be used to satisfy requirements for dualmaster's degrees. The details of a student's dual master's degrees program must be approved by the department chair/degree program directorand the dean or designee for each of the two degrees. Candidatesfor dual master's degrees must submit a formal petition to the di - rectors of each master's program before the conferral date of the first degree. Students apply for and receive each degree uponcompletion of all the requirements for that degree. The degreesmay or may not be completed simultaneously.Academic Regulations 55Academic Regulations /c183Undergraduate Academic Standards and Degree Requirements /c183Undergraduate University Requirements Academic Load An undergraduate student admitted to and enrolled in a de - gree program usually registers for 15 credit hours each semester so that the required minimum of 120 credit hours for the bache - lor's degree is completed in four years. In any given semester, a student may carry a minimum of 12 credit hours and be classified and certified (for veteran's bene - fits, financial aid, etc.) as full-time for that semester. The addi - tional credit hours must be made up through summer enrollmentor by an overload (if approved by the dean) in another semesterin order to maintain normal annual progress toward the degree,as is often required by the regulations of government agencies.Students are urged to become familiar with such regulations. Atotal of 19 credit hours is the maximum load permitted withoutspecial approval. An undergraduate student wishing to register for more than 19 credit hours in a semester is required to have the approval ofthe academic advisor and the appropriate dean. The approval isfor the overload, not permission for a specific course. Aper-credit-hour tuition fee is assessed, in addition to the full-timetuition fee, for registered credit hours over seventeen. Academic Probation and Dismissal An undergraduate student who fails to maintain the academic average required by the university and/or fails to make satisfac - tory progress toward a degree is subject to dismissal. A studentwho does not fulfill these criteria but who gives evidence ofprobable substantial improve ment may, under certain circum - stances and the discretion of the student's dean, be placed on ac - ademic probation for a specified period of time in lieu of beingdismissed. An undergraduate student who fails to maintain a 2.00 cumu - lative grade point average (GPA) during the first semester offull-time study (or the equivalent in part-time study) is subject toacademic probation or dismissal. A student whose cumulativeGPA after attempting or completing 24 credit hours (excludingcourses in which the recorded grade is W) falls below 1.00 willbe dismissed. A student whose c umulative GPA is at any time between 1.00 and 2.00 may be dismissed or, at the discretion ofthe student's dean, placed on academic probation. A student on probation may be subject to restrictions as to the course load for which he or she may register and is ineligible tohold office in student organizations or to participate in intercol - legiate activities. The student may be given permission to partic -ipate in intercollegiate athletics at the end of a semester in whichthe student's cumulative GPA is raised to 2.00, even though thestudent's probation may extend for an additional semester. Withpermission of the student's dean, a student may complete theseason of any collegiate sport in which he or she is participatingat the time the student's cumulative GPA falls below 2.00. Probationary and dismissal actions are made by the colleges and school each January, June, and August based on the stu - dent's academic performance. Students on academic probationare informed in writing of their status, the period of probation,and any conditions imposed by the student's dean. A student who is dismissed may not be readmitted to the uni- versity or enroll as a nondegree student for a full calendar yearafter the effective date of the dismissal. Actions involving academic probation and dismissal are en- tered on the student's permanent record and may not be re-moved. Changes in Field of Study Astudent who wishes to change from one college or school to another, or from one major to another, must receive the permis-sion of the dean or department chair in charge of the program towhich the student wishes to transfer. A change in college,school, or major affiliation, when approved, may not become ef - fective until the beginning of the next semester. It does not be - come effective if the student is suspended or dismissed. Astudent who changes a field of study may lose credit alreadyearned in other study that is not appropriate to the new program. Class Standing Undergraduate class standing is defined as follows: Credit Hours Completed Standing 0-29 Freshman 30-59 Sophomore 60-89 Junior 90 or above Senior It is university policy that no student shall be involuntarily subject to regulations and academic requirements introduced during the student's continuous enrollment in good standing in asingle degree program if the new regulations involve unduehardships or the loss of academic credits earned to satisfy the re - quirements previously in effect. 56Undergraduate students are governed by the following mini - mum requirements for the undergraduate degree (each teaching unit may have further major and major-related requirements).Undergraduate students are advi sed to consult their own advisor, department chair, or dean for detailed information. Credit Hour and Residence Requirements Associate Degree The Associate in Arts degree requires the completion of at least 60 credit hours. At least 24 of the last 30 credit hours ap - plied to the degree must be taken in residence at American Uni - versity. A maximum of 36 credit hours may be transferred to the degree. Students must complete at least 24 hours of courses in the General Education Program including one foundation course ineach of the five curricular areas and one second-level course ineach of three of the five curricular areas. Students must also ful - fill the College Writing and Writing Proficiency and the Univer - sity Mathematics Requirement. Bachelor's Degrees The university offers the following bachelor's degrees: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.), Bache-lor of Science (B.S.), and Bachelor of Science in Business Ad-ministration (B.S.B.A.). All bachelor's degrees require completion of at least 120 credit hours of course work. At least 45 credit hours out of thelast 60 must be completed in residence at American University.A minimum of 15 credit hours mus t be completed at American University in upper-level courses in the student's major. Amaxi-mum of 75 hours may be transferred towards a bachelor's de-gree. Credit earned in any American University course, on or offcampus, is residence credit. Credit earned by an American Uni-versity student through the Consortium of Universities of theWashington Metropolitan Area is also residence credit. Within the total 120 credit hours, students must fulfill the College Writing and Writing Proficiency Requirement, Univer - sity Mathematics Requirement, General Education Require - ment, and requirements for a major. Undergraduates may count a maximum of 12 credit hours of internship and cooperative education field experience towardthe 120 minimum credit hours required for graduation. The fieldexperience credit hours that may be counted toward the require - ments for a major or minor program may be fewer, as deter - mined by the academic department, but may not exceed the maximum of 12 credit hours. Two Undergraduate Degrees A student who fulfills all the requirements for two bachelor's programs (including major, major-related, and residence re - quirements) and earns a total of 150 credit hours may be awarded two bachelor's degrees. In order to be eligible for the second bachelor's degree, the student must apply for admission to the second degree program,preferably by the end of the junior year. If the student is grantedadmission to the second program, then upon completion of allrequirements for the first program and the award of the first de - gree, the student's status will be changed to the second program. The student must again apply for graduation to be granted thesecond bachelor's degree. Combined Bachelor's and Master's Degrees American University offers students the opportunity to earn both undergraduate and graduate degrees through its acceleratedbachelor's/master's programs. Students can choose from a widevariety of established bachelor's/master's programs, or they cancreate bachelor's/master's programs with the approval of the ac - ademic department supervising the graduate-level work. Stu - dents may complete graduate degrees in disciplines different than their undergraduate degrees, provided they are admitted tothe master's program by the supervising department and theyhave completed the prerequisites required for the graduate pro - gram. A student admitted to a combined bachelor's/master's pro - gram (involving tentative admi ssion to graduate standing, so that both a bachelor's and master's degree may be earned as theresult of a planned program of study) must follow a prescribedprogram of work, and the student's record must show whichcourses will be applied toward the undergraduate degree andwhich courses will be applied toward the master's degree. Once admitted to a combined bach elor's/master's program, a student may not be denied entry into that master's program if thatstudent completes the bachelor's program in good standing andmeets university and teaching unit minimum standards for ad-mission to the master's program involved. Students will be admitted to the combined program at two levels, once for the undergraduate degree and once for the grad-uate degree. Each school sets its own admission standards andprocedures. Tuition and fees will be paid on the basis of the levelat which the student is currently registered. When the studenthas completed the requirements for a bachelor's degree and hasbeen admitted to the graduate portion of the program, tuition andfees will be charged at the graduate rate. The undergraduate student may complete up to 3 credits for every 9 credits required for the graduate degree that may be ap - plied to the requirements for both degree programs. For exam - ple, a student may share up to 9 credits for a 30-hour master's degree and up to 12 credits for a 36-hour master's degree.Charges will be at the undergraduate rate. The department thatoversees the graduate program the student enters will determineif the courses the undergraduate student completes will satisfymaster's degree requirements. Departments are not required to accept courses that the student completes while he or she is anundergraduate. In addition to these shared credits, undergraduate students in a bachelor's/master's program ma y be able to reserve a particular course so that it counts only toward the master's degree require - ments This reserved course work will not count toward the bachelor's degree. Any reserved courses do not affect the stu -Academic Regulations 57dent's undergraduate G.P.A., nor do the credits count toward a student's full-time enrollment status in a given term. The stu - dent's official university transcript will note which courses are reserved for graduate credit only. Students are required to complete the graduation application and clearance process once for the bachelor's degree and oncefor the master's degree. Bachelor's/master's students m ust complete at least 18 in-res - idence credit hours at the graduate level after the bachelor's de - gree is earned. This represents a reduction from the established requirement of 24 credit hours of in -residence credit for master's students. Bachelor's/master's students must maintain continu - ous, sequential enrollment in the two programs. Students must finish the master's degree requirements within three years fromthe date of first enrollment in the master's program. Grade Point Average Students enrolled in an undergraduate degree program must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.00 in order to remainin good standing and to graduate. Evaluation of Progress An evaluation of each undergraduate student's progress is made by the office of the student's dean after each semester. Inaddition to the cumulative grade point average, this evaluationconsiders completion of all university requirements and the ratioof courses satisfactorily completed to all courses attempted bythe student. Students who are not making satisfactory progressare informed in writing of the result of their evaluation and of-fered academic advising. The university has no strict regulations governing the total amount of time an undergraduate student may take to fulfill therequirements for a degree, provided the student maintains theappropriate grade point average and gives evidence of being se - riously interested in the eventual achievement of his or her aca - demic objective. Freshman Forgiveness A freshman who, during the first two semesters of full-time study, receives a grade of F or X in a course may repeat thecourse at American University within the calendar year thereaf - ter, or in the next two regular semesters in which the student is enrolled. If the course is not offered within that time, the studentmay use the option the next time it is offered. No grade is re - moved from the student's record, but only the grade earned the second time the course is taken is used in calculating the gradepoint average for purposes of making decisions concerning pro - bation, dismissal, and requi red average for graduation. A part-time undergraduate or nondegree student who, during the first 30 credit hours of study, receives a grade of F in a coursemay repeat the course at American University within one calen - dar year after the semester in which the grade of F was received, with the resulting cumulative index benefits stated above.The freshman forgiveness rule does not apply to transfer stu - dents even though they may have entered the university with freshman status. Graduate Credit Senior students, with the written permission of their depart - ment chairs or deans, may enroll in specifically approved gradu - ate courses not required for their undergraduate programs. Such courses must be designated in writing as graduate-degree creditat the time the student registers for them. A copy of this writtenagreement must be filed in the Office of the Registrar. Retroac - tive application of these credits for such purposes is not permit - ted. Credit for these courses may be applied toward meeting the course requirements for a gradua te degree after the student has been awarded an undergraduate degree if the student is then ad - mitted to a graduate degree program. Leave of Absence Undergraduate students desiring a leave of absence for rea - sons other than study at another collegiate institution should re - quest an appointment with their dean. If it seems desirable to guarantee the student an automatic readmission, the dean will is-sue a permit for leave of absence. This permit will specify a limi-tation, one year at most, of automatic readmission to the sameundergraduate program. The permit becomes void if the student attends any domestic or foreign collegiate institution during the period of leave. Insuch instances, the student must obtain a permit to study at an-other institution before leaving American University. Major Requirements Each undergraduate must complete at least 36 credit hours in the degree major and related courses, no fewer than 15 of whichmust be earned in upper-level courses taken in residence atAmerican University. A grade of C (2.00) or better is required for each major, ma - jor-related, or minor course. S tudents should note that a C- does not qualify and any course with a C- or lower will have to be re - peated or an equivalent course taken to satisfy the major require - ment involved. Courses in the ma jor may be taken on a pass/fail basis only with permission of th e student's dean or department chair. Declaration of Major By the end of the sophomore year, if not before, each student must choose and formally declare an academic major. Admission to the university in an undergraduate program does not automatically constitute admission to a major program.Acceptance is official only when specific approval has beengranted by the department chair or program director. Multiple Majors A student may complete multiple majors by satisfactorily passing the major and major-related course work required by thedepartments or schools.58 Academic RegulationsIf the majors are pursued in different schools, the student must designate when declaring the majors which school he orshe will be enrolled in and graduated from. The student will needto satisfy the general requirements of that school only. If a stu - dent is majoring in recognized majors that lead to different de - grees (e.g., B.A. and B.S.), the student specifies which of the degrees is to be awarded. A student may apply the same courseto each major program in which it meets the requirements. Interdisciplinary Majors In addition to the established major programs, students have the option of constructing their own major programs leading to aB.A. or B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies. To design and com - plete an interdisciplinary major, a student must have the ap - proval of three faculty members who represent the various disciplines involved in the interdisciplinary field. The major ad - visor must be a full-time faculty member. The student applies for permission to undertake an interdisciplinary major to the dean ofthe school or college in which he or she is enrolled. If the focusof the interdisciplinary program makes a change of college orschool affiliation advisable, the student must follow the proce - dures for changes in fields of study. Interdisciplinary major program s must include a total at least 42 credit hours with grades of C or better, including 36 credithours selected to form an academically sound, unified, andwell-defined program, and 6 credit hours in independent studyor senior seminars supervised by the major advisor and focusedon the program's central concept. With prior approval, an appro-priate internship or advanced level course may be substituted forall or part of the 6-credit hour independent study. At least 75 percent of the 36 credit hours must be upper-level as defined by the teaching units that offer them. Students are en-couraged to include at least two 500-level courses, although insome areas this may not be possible. A maximum of 18 credithours of work completed prior to the semester in which applica - tion is made may be included in the program. Students must have at least a 2.50 grade point average (on a 4.00 scale) to be accepted. All arrangements should be com - pleted by the end of the first semester of the junior year, except by special permission of the appropriate dean, and no earlierthan the second semester of the freshman year. The student must submit a completed Interdisciplinary Studies Major Program Form, with required attachments andbearing the signatures of the major advisor and the two sponsors,to his or her dean. Information submitted must include the fol - lowing: 1. A statement of the central concept of the major and an expla - nation of its interdisciplinary character. 2. A statement demonstrating that existing programs do not sat - isfy educational needs or vocational goals of the student. 3. An outline of the academic requirements of the major, includ - ing a list of all required courses and a tentative schedule for their completion. Individually designed courses must be outlined.4. ADeclaration of Major Form, which must specify the name of the major and whether a B.A. or a B.S. degree is to be awardedupon successful completion of the program. In accepting the proposal for an interdisciplinary major, the dean's office certifies that the rules established for interdisciplin - ary studies have been followed and that courses necessary for completion of the program will be available, and assumes ad - ministrative responsibility for monitoring the student's progress and clearing the student for graduation. Minors Specific course requirements for minors are listed under de - partmental programs. All minor programs consist of a minimum of 18 credit hours, including at least 9 credit hours at the 300level or above. For all minors, at least 9 credit hours of the statedrequirements must be taken in residence at American Univer - sity. At least 12 credit hours of the minor must be outside of the course requirements for each major the student is pursuing. Agrade of C (2.00) or better is required for each course used to sat - isfy the requirements of a minor. Students should consult with their advisors as to the proce - dure for declaring a minor. Minors are noted as a comment on the student's permanent record at the time of graduation, but willnot appear on the student's diploma. Interdisciplinary Minors In addition to established minors, students have the option of constructing their own minor programs. To design and completean interdisciplinary minor, a student must have the approval oftwo faculty members who represent the disciplines involved. In-terdisciplinary minors must include a total of 24 credit hourswith grades of C or better, including at least 9 credit hours at the300 level or above, selected to form an academically sound, uni-fied, and well-defined program. For all minors, at least 9 credithours of the stated requirements must be taken in residence atAmerican University. At least 12 credit hours of the minor mustbe outside of the course requirements for each major the studentis pursuing. Pass/Fail Students may take up to 50 percent of their courses on a pass/fail basis. If a student's major department approves, thispercentage may be greater. Courses in the student's major mustbe taken for a letter grade unless special permission is given bythe dean or department chair. The grade of P (pass) is not used incalculating the grade point average. (For more information, seethe Academic Information and Regulations chapter.) Resuming Study Students who cease to attend the university for an entire se - mester, whether voluntarily or not, may not resume study until they have been readmitted. Readmitted students are subject toall regulations and must meet all requirements in force whenstudies are resumed unless other arrangements have been agreedAcademic Regulations 59to in writing by the student's dean before the beginning of such an absence. Students who change degree objective, college, or school, or who choose to conform to new regulations or requirements,must be prepared to complete all requirements and abide by allregulations in effect at the time such a change is made. Study at Another Institution Study at another institution is usually undertaken during the summer or as part of an study abroad program. Once matricu - lated at American University, students may have up to 6 credit hours transferred only from institutions accredited for grantingbachelor's or higher degrees. An enrolled student who plans to take courses at another col - lege or university for transfer credit to American University must be in good academic standing and must receive prior ap - proval from the student's department chair and dean using the Permit to Study Abroad form or the Permit to Study at AnotherU.S. Institution form. For study abroad, approval is also requiredfrom the AU Abroad director. If the course to be taken is outsidethe area of the student's major, the chair of the department whichwould offer credit for such a course must also approve the per-mit. Approval is granted for specific courses. Permits to Studymay not be authorized for courses at community colleges ornon-accredited four year institutions. The visited institution, if in the United States, must be region- ally accredited. With departmental approval, transfer credit isapplicable toward the requirements of a major. Transfer creditmay be used to fulfill General E ducation Requirements through the evaluation of equivalent courses taken at another institutionand with the approval of the student's dean. Because of the spe-cial nature of the program, after the student has been admitted toAmerican University no credit toward General Education Re - quirements may be earned through transfer credit. Study Abroad American University offers numerous study abroad pro - grams through the AU Abroad Program. Students may also par - ticipate in study abroad programs offered by other institutions that are part of a regionally accredited U.S. college or university,and are recorded on the transcripts of those institutions. For de - termination of regional accreditation, the publication Credit Given is the accepted reference. After consultation with and approval of the student's dean and the AU Abroad director, application is made directly to theinstitution for admission to its foreign study program. Transfercredit will be granted on the basis of the transcript from the spon - soring U.S. college or university. Students may also attend institutions abroad not affiliated with an American college or university. Requests for transfercredit must be made on a Permit to Study Abroad form and mustbe approved before the student registers at the foreign institu - tion. The institution to be visited must be approved by the stu - dent's dean and the AU Abroad director. The student's dean andacademic advisor review the official transcript when the student returns to confirm course approval, and forward the transcriptand evaluation to the Office of the Registrar for transfer of ap - proved credit. The student's academic advisor and dean also ap - prove the academic areas or specific courses of study. Students who complete the Permit to Study Abroad form and enroll in an non-AU study abroad program are required to paythe Permit to Study Abroad fee for each semester, includingsummer, they are registered. Transfer of Credit The Admissions Office evaluates official documents show - ing previous college-level work completed. Individual teaching units determine how this credit will apply to specific degree pro - grams. Grades and quality points earned in courses accepted for transfer will not be included in the grade point average to bemaintained at American University, but the credits will count to - ward the total number required for graduation. Transfer students may normally expect to receive credit for courses taken at collegiate institutions that were, at the time thecourses were taken, regionally accredited or recognized candi-dates for accreditation. These courses must be appropriate foracademic credit at American University towards an undergradu-ate degree program. A maximum of 75 credit hours will be ac-cepted on transfer from four-year collegiate institutions. Amaximum of 60 credit hours will be accepted from two-year col-legiate institutions. Amaximum of 75 credit hours from all insti-tutions of higher education may be transferred toward abachelor's degree. A maximum of 30 credit hours will be accepted on transfer for a combination of relevant work completed satisfactorily incollege-level Armed Services School courses, U.S. Armed Forces Institute correspondence or extension courses, or anyMilitary Occupational Skills (MOS) courses completed with agrade of 70 or better, as recommended at the baccalaureate levelby the American Council on Education and which is appropriatefor academic credit as determined by the Admissions Office af - ter consultation with the appropriate academic unit. Amaximum of 30 credit hours may be granted for a combina - tion of relevant work completed in college-level nondegree, cor - respondence or extension courses completed at an accredited institution provided the course work is recognized by that insti - tution for credit toward a degree, and is appropriate for academic credit as determined by the Admissions Office after consultationwith the appropriate academic unit. Transfer students may be awarded credit for satisfactory scores in subject examinations of the College Level Examina - tion Program (CLEP). Students may not receive credit for a sub - ject examination if a course comparable in content has been accepted in transfer by the university, or if the student failed sucha course (see Advanced Standing, below). Official score reportsmust be sent directly to the Admissions Office from the Educa - tional Testing Service. No transfer credit towards the General60 Academic RegulationsEducation requirements may be earned once the student has ma - triculated at American University. Advanced Standing Up to 30 credit hours will be accepted from one or a combina - tion of Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate, and CLEP subject examinations. Upon recommendation of theappropriate teaching unit, advanced standing may be awardedor a course requirement waived for an entering student on thebasis of performance in the Advanced Placement ExaminationProgram of the College Entrance Examination Board, theHigher Level subjects of the International Baccalaureate Pro - gram, or successful performance in the Subject Examination Program of the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). All undergraduate students in a degree program are eligible for course credit, with advanced placement where appropriate,on the basis of performance on the CLEP subject examinations,if the student has not failed or completed a credit-bearing coursecomparable in content. Course credit, with advanced placement where appropriate, will be assigned for successful performance in the Subject Ex - amination Program of CLEP, contingent upon the specification of norms and upon approval of the appropriateness of the con-tent of the examinations by the teaching unit concerned. Se-lected CLEP examinations may be applied to up to four coursesto meet General Education requirements (see below). Credit to-ward General Education requirements may be awarded only forexaminations taken prior to entering American University. Un-der no circumstances will students be permitted to re-take a sub-ject examination. Students should consult with their advisors as to how exami- nations will apply to their degree programs.

Eligible students should contact the Department of Mathe - matics and Statistics for more information about the Mathemat - ics and Statistics Equivalency Examination.62 Academic RegulationsUndergraduate Academic Honors Dean's List Each college or school may issue a dean's list of its under - graduate honor students at the end of each semester. The mini - mum standard for listing is a 3.50 grade point average for the semester, earned in a full-time undergraduate program of notfewer than 15 completed credit hours of which at least 12 hoursmust be completed for A-F grade credit. Graduation Honors Undergraduate graduation honors at American University in - clude Latin Honors, based on cumulative grade point average, and University Honors, based on a combination of honorscourse options, cumulative grade point average, and completionof an honors capstone. To be eligible for graduation honors, stu - dents must have completed at least 60 credit hours required for their degree in residence at American University and haveachieved the requisite grade point average. Both Latin Honorsand University Honors are listed in the commencement programand on the student's diploma and permanent record. Latin Honors Undergraduate Latin Honors and the grade point averages re- quired are as follows: summa cum laude : 3.90 or magna cum laude : 3.70 through 3.89 cum laude : 3.50 through 3.69 No more than 15 credit hours taken Pass/Fail may be included inAmerican University work applied toward Latin Honors.Courses taken Pass/Fail are not computed in the grade point av-erage. University Honors Program The University Honors Program is a comprehensive program of honors options drawn from the General Education curriculumand departmental course offerings to qualified undergraduatestudents. The program is characterized by small seminars, indi - vidualized attention from faculty, unique access to the resources of Washington, D.C., and the special atmosphere of an honorscommunity of committed faculty and students. Qualified entering freshmen, transfer students, and current students are eligible for admission to the program. Enteringfreshmen are admitted to the program based upon excellence in their high school academic performance. Other students, includ - ing transfers, may be admitted to the program at the discretion of the honors director if they have achieved a cumulative gradepoint average (GPA) of 3.60 for the equivalent of at least one ac - ademic year (30 credit hours). Students entering the program as freshmen are required to complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of honors course workwith a grade of B or better in each honors course and a cumula - tive GPA of 3.50 or above. Honors students take 12 to 18 credit hours of foundation-level work from honors sections of English,statistics, General Education, or departmental courses. Six to 12 credit hours of advanced level (300 or above) specialized honorswork is drawn from honors sections of major or major-relatedcourses, honors supplements linked to courses in the major or re - lated fields, University Honors colloquia, and honors independ - ent study. All University Honors students must complete an honors senior capstone project (3 to 6 credit hours). Students who enter the University Honors Program after the freshman year are not required to complete the full 30 hours ofhonors course work. Exceptions to the number of required hoursare determined by the program director and subtracted from thefoundation-level requirements. All University Honors students are required to meet with their Honors counselor for advisement before registering eachsemester. Students who fulfill the requirements for the University Hon- ors Program are eligible to graduate with University Honors.University Honors Program students whose honors work in-cludes completion of 12 hours of advanced-level honors work inthe major (which may include senior capstone credits) will, withdepartmental recommendation, graduate with University Hon - ors in the Major.

Aimed at build - ing a strong intellectual foundation, the General Education requirements are drawn from five curricular areas. The programis designed to be completed during the first two years of study,allowing students ample time to pursue their major as well asstudy abroad, internships, and minors or second majors. The General Education Program is the cornerstone of your academic program at American University. This chapter willhelp guide you in building a meaningful and valuable program.As you read through it, you should keep in mind the following: /c183students take a total of ten General Education courses; two courses in each of five areas /c183students begin each Curricular Area by taking a foundationcourse, which forms the base for a second level course /c183all second level courses are linked to a cluster of foundationcourses, one of which must be taken as a prerequisite for thesecond level course /c183no more than two courses from a discipline may be taken forGeneral Education credit; disciplines are designated by thecourse number subject prefix (e.g., ANTH, BIO) /c183once a student has enrolled, all courses to fulfill GeneralEducation Requirements must be taken at AmericanUniversity General Education Program Definitions Curricular Area (or \"Area\"): One of the five content-specific subdivisions of the General Education Program: 1 .T h eC r e a t i v eA r t s2. Traditions that Shape the Western World3. Global and Multicultural Perspectives4. Social Institutions and Behavior5. The Natural Sciences The Area is represented after a course title as the first number in the following: 1:x, 2:x, 3:x, 4:x, or 5:x. course course in the General Educa - tion Program. Second-level course : A 200-level course in the General Educa - tion Program.Level: Refers to whether a course is a foundation or a sec - ond-level course. The level is represented after a course title as the second number in the following: x:1 or x:2. Cluster : One of two groups of courses (several foundation courses and a larger number of second-level courses) in a Cur - ricular Area. Sequence: A specified order for taking General Education classes: take a foundation course first and follow it with one ofthe second-level courses from the same cluster. Discipline : Refers to the subject prefix in a course number re- gardless of academic department or course content. For exam-ple, the course number PHIL-105 refers to a philosophy course;the course number RELG-210 refers to a religion course. Al-though these courses are in the Philosophy and Religion Depart-ment, they have different prefixes and are in differentdisciplines. The course number ARTH-105 refers to an art his-tory course; the course number HIST-100 refers to a historycourse. Although these courses are both about history, they arein different disciplines. Curricular Area Requirements Students select courses from those that are designated as General Education courses. St udents choose two courses, one foundation course and one second-level course in the same clus - ter, in each curricular area. Each curricular area offers students a choice of one of two course clusters comprising several foundation courses any of which may lead to a larger number of second-level courses. Courses at the foundation level introduce students to the fun - damental concepts, issues, and achievements in the disciplines. Courses deal explicitly with the appropriate processes and stan - dards for gathering and evaluating information (quantification, experiments, primary sources, authoritative texts) and interpre - tation (methods of investigation and analytic skills) in a specific disciplinary field. All science foundation courses include labo - ratory experience. The courses are designed to help students achieve a broad view of how different disciplinary viewpointsand fields of knowledge can contribute to their understanding ofthemselves and the world around them. 64General Education foundation courses differ from traditional survey courses by integrating into the course some of the per - spectives and foundation skills essential to a full education. These elements include the following, as appropriate: /c183written and oral communication /c183critical thinking, including information literacy /c183ethical awareness /c183aesthetic sensibility /c183diverse perspectives, including race, class, culture, gender, and academic discipline /c183a global point of view The second-level courses follow specific groups of founda - tion courses, forming a coherent curricular sequence and rein - forcing the learning objectives of the foundation course. The foundation courses selected from a variety of disciplines assurebreadth in the student's program while the second-level coursesbuild on the foundation and encourage study in depth. Course Selection Students select two courses, a foundation course followed by a more specialized course in an approved sequence, in each cur-ricular area. Students will not be able to satisfy General Educa-tion Requirements with more than two courses in any onediscipline even though a discipline may have courses includedin more than one curricular area. Courses required for CollegeWriting and University Mathematics do not count in thetwo-course limit. Prerequisites A second-level course may not be taken for General Educa- tion credit until after the prerequisite foundation course has beensatisfactorily completed. Students who have placed at or belowFinite Mathematics must satisfy the University MathematicsRequirement before enrolling in a foundation course in the Nat - ural Sciences curricular area. Students who have placed above Finite Mathematics may take the foundation course in the Natu - ral Sciences curricular area at the same time they take the course work satisfying the University Mathematics Requirement, oreven beforehand. Relation to the Major The requirements for the major, the area of a student's aca - demic concentration, are listed under individual degree pro - grams. Many of the courses in the General Education Program also meet requirements of the major. Students interested in adouble major need to plan ahead if they expect to fulfill all re - quirements within 120 credit hours. Grading Requirements To receive General Education credit, a student must success - fully complete a General Education course with a grade of D or better. Students may elect to take a General Education course ona pass/fail basis. However, if the course is also being taken to ful - fill a requirement for the major the grading policies for that pro - gram should be consulted. Advanced Placement Credit Students presenting a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement ex - amination, qualifying score on the CLEPexamination, or grades for which they have received credit from the British A Levels,CEGEP, International Baccalaureate, German Abitur, or otherinternational credential for which they have been granted creditby American University may apply the credit for up to fourcourses to meet General Education requirements in any of thefive curricular areas. Credit for General Education may only beawarded when specific General Education courses, which havebeen so designated, match particular exam results (with the ex - ception of the CEGEPand German Abitur, which are handled ad hoc) and only for examinations taken prior to entering AmericanUniversity. Specific information regarding application of thisprinciple is contained in the \"General Education AdvancedPlacement Credit Articulation\" effective for the academic yearof admission. This document is maintained by the General Edu - cation office and is available in all advising units. Transfer Students Transfer students satisfy their General Education Require- ments through a combination of appropriate transfer courses andcompletion of courses in the General Education Program atAmerican University. Through the evaluation of equivalentcourses taken at another institution and with the approval of astudent's dean, transfer credit may fulfill all 30 credit hours. Insome cases, students supplement t ransfer credit with General Education courses taken at the university to meet the 30-hour re-quirement. The need to satisfy sequences is waived when 6hours in a curricular area are accepted for transfer credit. Associate in Arts Degree In the fields in which the university offers an associate de - gree, this degree requires the completion of at least 60 credit hours. Twenty-four hours of courses must be in the General Ed - ucation Program, to include one foundation course in each of the five curricular areas and one second-level course in each of threeof the five curricular areas. Study at Another Institution Transfer credit may be used to fulfill General Education Re - quirements through the evaluation of equivalent courses taken at another institution and with the approval of the student's dean.Because of the special nature of the program, after the studenthas been admitted to a degree program at American Universityno credit toward General Education Requirements may beearned through transfer credit.General Education Program 65General Education and the University Mathematics Requirement All students must fulfill the University Mathematics Re - quirement before enrolling in their first (foundation level) course in the Natural Sciences curricular area (Area 5), unlessthey have placed above Finite Mathematics. Students who haveplaced above the level of Finite Mathematics may take the foun - dation course before or concurrently with course work taken to satisfy the University Mathematics Requirement. Questions about General Education Who has to complete the General Education Program? All American University undergraduates must fulfill General Education requirements. How many courses do I take? You must take two courses in each of the five Curricular Areas (for a total of ten). First select one of two course clusters inan area. Take from it a foundation course and then follow it witha second-level course that appears in the same cluster. This se - quencing is essential to the concept of the program, as each sec- ond-level course links in content to particular foundationcourses. Is it possible to take a second-level course before taking the foundation course? No, if you are taking the courses for General Education credit, the foundation courses serve as a prerequisite for sec-ond-level courses. What if a course closes before I can register for it or it's not of- fered the semester I want to take it? Almost all courses are offered at least once a year, so wait un - til next semester and see if it fits into your schedule. Or, you may take a different course if it's compatible with your schedule andyou've met all the prerequisites. However, if it's a second-levelcourse, be sure it's in the same cluster as the foundation courseyou've taken. How many courses may I take from each discipline for General Education credit? Although some academic departments have courses in sev - eral Areas, you may not take more than two General Education courses in a discipline. For example, you may only take two so - ciology courses (course numbers beginning with SOCY) out of your ten General Education courses. What grade do I have to get in my General Education classes? You must get a D or better in order to get General Education credit. You may also take a General Education class on apass/fail basis. However, if you are taking a General Educationclass to fulfill a requirement towards your major, you may needa different grade. Check with the appropriate academic depart - ment to be sure.May I take a General Education course, but not for General Ed - ucation credit? Yes, you may be able to count courses in the General Educa - tion Program towards your major or minor requirements, or for elective credit. Courses are offered for non-General Educationcredit under the same course number. May I spread out my General Education courses over four years? The program is designed so that it can be completed in your first two years. You should finish your General Education re - quirements as soon as possible to keep your last years open for off-campus opportunities, such as internships and study abroad.If you have not yet completed your math requirement, it is es - sential that you speak to your advisor about its connection to the Area 5 Natural Sciences requirement. Is there any way I can be exempted from the General Education requirements? No, all undergraduate students at American University must complete the General Education Program as well as the CollegeWriting and University Mathematics requirements. May I use my advanced placement credits towards General Ed- ucation requirements? Students presenting a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement ex- amination, qualifying score on the CLEPexamination, or gradesfor which they have received credit from the British A Levels,CEGEP, International Baccalaureate, German Abitur or otherinternational credential for which they have been granted creditmay be able to apply the credit for up to four courses to meet theGeneral Education requirements in any of the five CurricularAreas. Credit for General Education may only be awarded whenspecific General Education courses, which have been so desig - nated, match particular exam results (with the exception of the CEGEPand German Abitur, which are handled ad hoc) and onlyfor exams taken prior to entering American University. Specificinformation is contained in the General Education AdvancedPlacement Credit Articulation effective for the academic year ofadmission. This document is maintained by the General Educa - tion Office and is available in all advising units and online at: www.american.edu/provost/gened/CreditByExam.cfm . What if I want to take a General Education course at another school or use a study abroad course for General Educationcredit? Due to the unique nature of General Education courses and how they're taught, once students are enrolled, they must com - plete all General Education courses at American University. Courses at other institutions or other American Universitycourses may not be substituted.66 General Education ProgramDo transfer students have to complete General Education re - quirements? Yes, transfer students must still fulfill General Education re - quirements. However, course s taken prior to admission to American University will be matched with General Educationcourses to determine whether they qualify for credit in the pro - gram. It is technically possible for all ten courses to be trans - ferred with a dean's approval. If a student transfers both courses in one Curricular Area, the sequencing requirement is waived. Where do I go for help in planning my General Education courses? Students should take the responsibility of planning which General Education courses they will take, making sure they fol - low all program requirements and rules. Each semester before registering online, you will be reminded to review your elec - tronic degree audit report, which will indicate the General Edu - cation requirements you still need to fulfill.

The arts provide us with arich record of human cultures and values throughout time. Theyenable us to understand and enjoy the experiences of our sensesand to sharpen our aesthetic sense\u2014that human quality throughwhich we comprehend beauty. To appreciate the relationshipbetween form and meaning is to realize that the creative arts, re - gardless of their medium of expression, share important princi - ples. Courses in this curricular area have varied emphases: the pro - cess of creativity, the analysis of the artistic imagination, or the relationship between artists, their works, and the societies inwhich their works are produced. Students may choose a\"hands-on\" experience and pai nt, draw, design, or write a poem. Alternatively, they may study both classic and recent works ofliterature, art, music, dance, or theatre. All courses in this areachallenge the student to understand creativity and the distinctiveintellectual process of the human imagination. The Creative Arts: Goals /c183examine the nature of creativity, especially imaginative and intuitive thinking /c183situate creative works, and judgments about those creativeworks, in their appropriate social and historical contextdevelop the student's own creative and expressive abilities,so that the student can better understand the qualities thatshape an artist's work Foundation Courses: Students select a 100-le vel course in one of the two clusters.

Whether dominant or prevailing values that manypeople of Western countries share or the folk traditions that growout of small communities, these deeply rooted phenomena helpus make choices about identity and affinity with family, commu - nity, history, values, and place. Courses in this curricular area have varied emphases. Some examine powerful visions that philosophers, political theorists,historians, religious thinkers, scientists, and social critics haveof the Western experience. Others explore competing ideasabout human nature, liberty and equality, and the consequencesof social change. Finally, some uncover those traditions growingout of the unique experiences of women, ethnic groups, and in - digenous peoples as they express and preserve their own princi - ples of social organization and cultural expression.All courses in this area emphasize chronology and share a close attention both to the substance of the past and the ways tostudy it.

Through an exploration of societies of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, LatinAmerica and Europe, this curricular area opens the doors intovaried cultures and issues that challenge a parochial understand - ing of the world. Students may select courses that focus on the major issues of contemporary world politics, including management of conflict,economic competition, and environmental threats to the qualityof life. Alternatively, there are courses that emphasize either acomparative or cross-cultural examination of cultures, societies,polities, and belief systems and acknowledge the importance ofrecognizing and overcoming cultural barriers. Finally, there arecourses which focus on the dilemma of the global majority\u2014thethree-quarters of the world's population who live in countriesstriving for national identity as well as economic and politicaldevelopment. All courses in this area encourage a better understanding of the dimensions of experience and belief that distinguish culturesand countries from one another and, conversely, the commonali - ties that bind human experience together. The courses aim to stimulate awareness of the need for enhanced international andintercultural communication.

In comprehending the mechanisms and rulesthat give shape to complex societies, we gain strength to influ - ence institutional processes. Through reflection on principles that explain human behavior, we create understanding of our in - terpersonal experiences. Courses in this curricular area are of three kinds: those that use one of the traditional social science disciplines to provide anoverview of the interaction of individuals and the institutionsthat shape our economic, political, and social experience; thosethat focus on a single institution and the complex ways in whichit affects our lives; and those that use a societal dilemma as theentry point for discovering the ways in which the quality of indi - vidual life is protected or challenged in various settings. The many and distinct disciplines that contribute to this area are united by a self-conscious dedication to the modes of inquiryof contemporary social science, as applied to the American ex - perience. As strongly as it emphasizes the substance of knowl - edge, this curricular area emphasizes how we create knowledge and arrive at understanding. Social Institutions and Behavior: Goals /c183study the institutions, systems, and patterns of governance and of economic and social organization that underliecontemporary societies /c183place policy options and their consequences in theirappropriate social and political context, drawing on classicand contemporary theories of human organization /c183develop the student's capacity to critically reflect on theorganization of societies and the relationship between theindividual and the society, using the distinctive methods ofinquiry appropriate to the study of social institutions Foundation Courses: Students select a 100-le vel course in one of the two clusters.

Whether chemist, bi - ologist, physicist, or experiment al psychologist, scientists rely on theory and experimentation to test and refine understandingof our bodies, our complex environment, and the universe. All courses in this curricular area focus on the nature of scien - tific reasoning, discovery, and invention through the systematic exploration of basic concepts w ithin their historical context. Foundation courses unite \"hands-on\" scientific experimenta - tion, inductive reasoning, and deductive analysis with the study of basic principles such as the structure of matter, biologicalevolution, human behavior, and thermodynamics. The sec - ond-level courses include both traditional advanced study in each discipline as well as integrative courses such as oceanogra - phy, earth sciences, astronomy, and human biochemistry and health. This curricular area conveys a respect for the naturalworld, extends scientific literacy, and refines the modes of thought that characterize scientific inquiry. The Natural Sciences: Goals /c183study the makeup and workings of the natural world and the beings inhabiting it /c183examine the historical development and current status ofscientific methods, concepts, and principles, allowingcontemporary scientific knowledge to be placed in itsproper context /c183develop the student's own problem-solving and laboratoryskills, so that the student can better understand howscientific research works Foundation Courses: Students select a 100-le vel course in one of the two clusters.

The college provides a rich education in the liberal arts and sciences for all of American University's undergraduate stu - dents, offers challenging programs of study for its undergradu - ate and graduate majors; and fosters outstanding research, practice, and creative activity. The college is committed to the core purposes of liberal edu - cation: promoting free and rational discourse, fostering an un - derstanding of the diversity of human experience, providing the critical intellectual skills necessary to navigate a rapidly chang - ing world, and integrating knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. Undergraduate Study Academic Advisement The college challenges students to assume substantial re - sponsibility for defining their educational goals, yet provides careful professional guidance to help them respond to the chal - lenge. Undergraduates plan their academic programs with aca - demic counselors and faculty advisors according to their interests, professional plans, and academic progress. Beforethey enroll in classes, first-semester freshmen choose courseswith the assistance of a detailed curriculum guide. Duringfreshman orientation, students are assigned an academic coun - selor who serves as the primary advisor until they choose theirmajors, usually by the end of the sophomore year. After stu - dents formally declare their majors, they are advised by faculty advisors from their major departments, but may consult withtheir academic counselor as needed. At transfer orientation orupon enrollment, transfer students meet with an academiccounselor and then go to the departments of their intended ma - jors for academic advisement as described above. Transfer stu - dents undecided on a major, are advised by an academic counselor. Foreign Language The university encourages students to gain proficiency in at least one foreign language, especially those embarking on a ca-reer in international relations, study of the humanities, or spe-cialization in minority groups in the United States. Graduatestudy will often require proficiency in one or more foreign lan-guages. Internships and Cooperative Education Internship and cooperative education engage students in practical experiences, support learning, and provide on-the-jobtraining. Interns work in many organizations in both the publicand the private sectors in the Washington area. The growingnumber of internships in the college is testimony to both theirpopularity and their success. For more information on intern - ships and cooperative education, students should consult with their academic units and the Career Center. Majors No later than the end of the sophomore year, CAS students are expected to declare an academic major. In this field the stu - dent pursues study in depth and synthesizes academic knowl - edge. Major programs are desc ribed in the departmental sections. Students should become familiar with departmentalrequirements and regulations as stated in this catalog. Whenmaking a formal declaration of major, students are assigned anacademic advisor who will supervise their studies until gradua - tion. Students interested in the natural sciences, mathematics, music, and art need to take specific courses in the freshman yearif they intend to complete a degree in eight semesters. Such stu - dents should declare their interests as soon as possible and seek explicit counseling from the appropriate department. 73Interdisciplinary Major This program permits College of Arts and Sciences under - graduates to complete an interdisciplinary major according to their needs, abilities, and interests.

Director: Katarina Vester (History) The American Studies Program offers a highly interdisci - plinary major and minor in which students can explore the dif - ferent cultures and cultural expressions of the United States during its history and today. Students have the opportunity toresearch complex questions and follow interests that go be - yond the confines of a single discipline and which are crucial to an understanding of U.S. society and politics. AmericanStudies students learn to analyze U.S. society through sourcesranging from historical documents, paintings, films, literature,blogs, and video games, thus preparing them for a wide rangeof careers in the media, museums, urban planning, education,and governmental and non-governmental organizations, in theUnited States or abroad. The faculty consists of expert teachers and scholars from different departments, including anthropology, art history, his-tory, literature, and education, who cooperate closely withD.C. community leaders and institutions, thus bringing diverselearning experiences into the classroom. Courses in AmericanStudies encourage students to use the many resources D.C. hasto offer and to participate in internships and service-learning(themed volunteer work accompanying a specific course andsupervised by faculty). Many of our students find internshipsand part-time jobs in D.C.'s political and cultural institutions,thus complementing their education with practical experience. Taking advantage of its unique location, the American Studies Program at AU focuses on studies of urban D.C. andthe region as well as the study of the United States' diverse cul - tural relations with the world (such as migration, tourism, and ethnic cuisine). We encourage students to participate in AU'sStudy Abroad Program to experience an outside perspectiveon the U.S. The American Studies Program at AU offers aunique profile and learning experience from which studentscan benefit in many ways.

Shapiro-Perl Humans have always constituted their families, sexuality, gendered identities, social groups, religious practices, work,play, and artistic expression in dramatically diverse ways. An-thropologists explore everyday experience, cultural difference,and power relations in order to understand this diversity in thecontext of local and global histories. Stark inequalities are alsopart of the human experience, and anthropologists seek to un-cover the ideologies and processes that create and mask thoseinequalities. Different kinds of anthropologists explore difference and power from specialized perspectives. Cultural and social an - thropologists search for the connections between cultural meanings and lived human experience. Archaeologists probethe remains of past civilizations for significant transformationsin the ways communities organized their homes and labor. Bio - logical anthropologists document the dynamics of human evo - lution and study nutrition, health, and illness in their cultural contexts. Linguists examine the varied texts that speakers createfor clues that language holds to hierarchy and personal expres - sion. Anthropology students examine past and present societies to bring anthropological and archaeological theory and practiceto ongoing struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, in - equality, poverty, environmental degradation, and ethnic/cul - tural genocide. The undergraduate anthropology program at American University introduces students to all four subfields ofanthropology, and many students specialize in one. Graduateprograms include the M.A. in Public Anthropology and doc - toral concentrations in cultural/social anthropology; archaeol - ogy; and race, gender, and social justice. A Certificate in Public Anthropology is offered for both undergraduates and graduatestudents. All programs stress active, cooperative learning, foranthropology opens up many exciting questions for discussion and debate. Students are encouraged to learn outside the classroom, through internships and job placements, field trips and experi - ential classes, and study abroad. Washington, D.C. offers many opportunities for students to broaden their learning through mu - seums and research facilities and the rich community life of the city. Many anthropology majors choose to spend a semesterabroad. With prior approval, the department accepts coursestaken through AU Abroad as credit for the major. B.A. in Anthropology Admission to the Program Formal admission to the major by the department's under- graduate studies director requires a cumulative grade point av-erage of 2.00 (on a 4.00 scale) and a grade point average of 2.00or higher in two anthropology courses.

Sakellion Professorial Lecturer A. Pearson Instructor R. Nover The Department of Art encompasses the creative activities of the fine arts (painting, sculpture, printmaking, andmultimedia), the artistic applications of design, and the theo - retical and historical concerns of art history. These comple- mentary programs function together, so that the student gainsnot only depth of knowledge in a chosen specialty but also thebreadth of experience that yields understanding of artistic tra-ditions, values, cultural awareness, and contemporary issues.A faculty of exhibiting artists, pr acticing designers, published and respected historians, and strong studio programs focusedon giving students facility with materials and familiarity withvisual and theoretical concepts make the art department, in ef-fect, an art school within a university. The Art Department offers the Bachelor of Arts in Art His- tory, Graphic Design, or Studio Art, all of which can also betaken as minors, a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and M.F.A. in StudioArt. The study of art awakens the ability to undertake a serious exploration of visual form, opens the mind to the special mean - ings encoded in visual language, and develops the creative, ex - pressive, and analytic abilities inherent in all people. In studio courses, students learn to see with acuity, to explore forms innature or from the imagination, and to make images that areformally coherent and personally expressive. In art historycourses, students are introduced to the art of civilizations pastand present, learn how to interpret works of art critically andhistorically, and discover how art functions both to reflect andto shape social values. In graphic design courses, students de - velop an understanding of the dynamic power of visual imag - ery and learn to apply their knowledge of the formal elements of art to the production of effective graphic communication. American University's Katzen Arts Center provides stu - dents with a state of the art facility for the investigation and pursuit of both the visual and performing arts. The Art Depart - ment's offices, classrooms, and studios are equipped for the in - struction of drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, design, computer graphics, multimedia, and ceramics.As well as multiple performance stages and a full array of classroom and studio facilities, the Katzen Arts Center containsmore than 30,000 square feet of gallery space and an impressivemuseum including the Watkins and Katzen collections, withworks by Avery, Chagall, Dove, Klee, Kokoshka, Marin,Matisse, and Picasso, and a vital rotating schedule of exhibitions.The many world-class museums in Washington, D.C. also forman integral component of students' experience at American Uni - versity. In addition to the full-time faculty, each year the studio pro - gram brings nationally and internationally distinguished visiting artists-in-residence to the depa rtment, including Olive Ayhens, Gregory Amenoff, Barth, Jake Coffey,Diana Diamond, Donovan, Judy Glantzman, Glenn Goldberg, MargaretGrimes, Diana Guerrero-Macia, Bill Jensen, Shirley Kaneda,Catherine Murphy, Judy Pfaff, Katherine Porter, HannelineRogeberg, Roger Tibbetts, Tracy Miller, James Sheehan, PatSteir, John Walker, Stephan Westfall, and others. An internationally-prominent art history faculty and strong curriculum give the art history major a solid grounding in art as ahistorical and humanistic discipline in an environment that pro-vides continuing contact with art in the making. Because of theuniversity's location in one of the major art capitals of the worldand its proximity to Washington's great museums and art collec-tions, all programs afford students the advantage of immediateexperience with art masterp ieces of the past and present. The design curriculum is highly structured and sequential to provide students with the theory and practice of graphic commu-nications design applicable to many purposes, as well as the de - velopment of professional production methods. Courses coverpublication and editorial design, corporate identity, packaging,illustration, poster design, multimedia, experience and interac - tive design, etc. Along with creative and technical skills, verbal and analytical abilities are developed through class critiques.Through internships with designers working in the field, stu - dents learn to balance the ideal creative solution with the reality of budget constraints, technical limitations, and deadlines. An important objective of the department is to prepare stu - dents for careers in the arts. Given the sound theoretical and technical bases of our programs, graduates find that a wealth ofindividual career opportunities awaits them. Depending on thespecific discipline pursued, they have become professionalpainters and sculptors, teachers, critics, graphic designers, illus - trators, and exhibition design specialists. Graduates also go on to careers in museum and gallery work, visual resources, and his - toric preservation.82 College of Arts and SciencesB.A. in Art History Admission to the Program Formal admission to the major requires satisfactory comple - tion (grades of C or better) of 12 credit hours of art history courses and departmental approval.

Sheng, R. Sonenshine, M. Yesuf Economist in Residence C. Grown, E. Kraft, S. Mathur Professorial Lecturer J.C. Augustine, D. Lin, M. Martell The Department of Economics at American University emphasizes economic studies that enable graduates to partici - pate actively in the process of finding answers to the important economic questions that face our society and other nations ofthe world. Emphasis is placed on viewing economic problems in both their domestic and international contexts. The university's location in Washington, D.C. enables it to assist students and graduates i n obtaining employment and in - ternships in several of the world's most important economic in - stitutions, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, research institutes, and the treasury, labor, and commercedepartments. Many of our gradua tes find policy-making posi - tions in the public and private sectors of both the United States and other nations. The Department of Economics adopts a pluralistic approach to economics education that includes neoclassical, Keynesian,and institutional economics as well as political economy. Inter - national economic issues receive special emphasis, as do such socially-important topics as the economics of gender. The neo - classical and Keynesian traditions form the core of economic theory that our majors are expected to master. The study of eco - nomic history, the history of economic thought, and alternative economic methodologies alert students to divergent perspectivesand to the role of institutions. Courses in specialized fields dealwith monetary economics, public finance, economic develop -102 College of Arts and Sciencesment, the structure of U.S. industry, international trade and fi - nance, and the economics of earnings and employment. Economics programs are designed to allow students the flexibility of a double major with other departments in the Col - lege of Arts and Sciences or with programs in other schools within AU. Within the B.A. in Economics students choose thegeneral or international track. Students in the B.S. in Economicsprogram gain the analytic and quantitative skills necessary forresearch positions and Master's level study in Economics. TheB.S. in Mathematics and Econom ics prepares students for a broad range of experiences including Ph.D. level work in eco - nomics. The M.A. in Economics offers a general economics track as well as tracks in business econom ics, development economics, financial economic policy, and g ender analysis in economics. The Ph.D. in Economics offers a choice of theory tracks inmicroeconomics, macroeconom ics, and heterodox economics, as well as a range of applied fields. Study Abroad American University's AU Abroad program offers study abroad programs in which students take courses, participate ininternships, and interact with public officials and political lead - ers. Students wishing to use courses from study abroad pro- grams to count as their capstone must obtain approval of theundergraduate advisor. Honor Society A chapter of Omicron Delta Epsilon, the economics honor society, is active on campus. Membership requires an overallgrade point average of 3.25 and a grade point average of 3.50 ineconomics courses. Consult the undergraduate advisor for fur-ther eligibility requirements. Special Opportunities Several student prizes are awarded usually each spring: The Robert T. Adams Scholarship in support of an outstanding student majoring in Economics withdemonstrated financial need The Ruth Dewey Meade Prize for undergraduate researchThe Simon Naidel Prize for the best performance on a comprehensive examination in economic theory The Frank Tamagna Prize for excellence in international finance and monetary economics The Jos\u00e9 Epstein Prize in Development FinanceThe James Weaver Prize for Excellence in TeachingThe Nikos G. and Anastasia Photias Prize for dissertation research B.A. in Economics Admission to the Program Formal admission to the major requires a grade point aver - age of 2.00 (on a 4.00 scale) and the approval of the department undergraduate advisor.

The academic programs pro - vide students with opportunities to collaborate with profession -als in a large array of organizations that complement their pro - gram of study. Further, international opportunities are available to students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Degreeprograms can be completed on a full or part time basis, andknowledge is gained through community service, internships,practica, and related-research work. The SETH faculty and programs demonstrate a commit - ment to the advancement of knowledge about the nature, func - tion, and practice of education and health. Faculty conduct a wide range of research with emphasis on equity, gender, healthpromotion, multiculturalism, nutrition, socioeconomic status,learners with special needs, the infusion of technology into edu - cation, adult learning, and the relationship of government and public policy to education. Themes common to faculty researchand programs include meeting the needs of special learners, im - proving the health of society, decreasing health disparities, re - search-informed policy development, as well as domestic and international formal and non-formal education. SETH is hometo the Institute for Innovation in Education, the Urban Collabo - rative for Urban Research, Educational, and Development, and campus-wide collaborative projects on societal health research.School of Education, Teaching and Health 111Students benefit from working with a highly qualified and dedicated faculty in small classes, and from opportunities toparticipate in ongoing faculty research aimed at influencingeducational and health policy and practice.

C .C u l v e r Associate Professor K. Kim Assistant Professor S.E. MacAvoy The environment has become a nexus of a broad range of global issues including climate change, biodiversity loss, andresource competition. Environmental sustainability, whichcombines environmental, economic , and social considerations, provides a valuable and holistic framework for addressingmany of these concerns, and the ability to apply that under - standing appropriately and effectively in public discourse. The goal of the Department of Environmental Science is to inspire and train leaders concerned about sustainability with theknowledge and critical thinking skills to make independent, ra - tional decisions concerning current and emerging environmen - tal issues. To this end, the department provides rigorous, interdisciplinary programs grounded in a sound, scientific un - derstanding of how our natural world works. The Department of Environmental Science offers the B.A. in EnvironmentalStudies, B.S. in Environmental Science, minor in environmen-tal science, M.S. in Environmental Science, and Graduate Cer-tificate in Environmental Assessment. The B.A. in Environmental Studies builds upon a set of foundational courses in both the natural and social sciences.The student then chooses from an approved list of relatedcourses spanning many disciplines, from all schools and col-leges at AU, to create a program of study suited to his or herspecific interests and professional goals. Students are also en-couraged to gain practical field experience through an intern - ship at one or more of the many public and private environmental organizations in the Washington, D.C. area.Graduates will be prepared for employment in a broad range offields where scientific information is applied in the develop - ment and implementation of environmental policies. The B.S. in Environmental Science draws principally from the natural sciences, including biology, chemistry, physics, andmathematics and statistics. In addition to classroom work, theprogram provides students with extensive training in both fieldand laboratory techniques applicable to the study of the naturalenvironment. Students are strongly encouraged to seek researchexperience with faculty and engage in the creation of new sci - entific knowledge. Opportunities to carry our research at one of the many research institutions in the Washington, DC area arealso available. A minor in environmental science is also available for those interested in adding breadth to their standard science or socialpolicy degrees. The minor prepares students for employment inenvironmental research, policy, or management, or for furthergraduate work in the natural or social sciences. The M.S. in Environmental Science offers an opportunity to expand students' knowledge base for developing solutions toenvironmental problems. The program provides two ap - proaches: course-focused or research-focused. Students in the course-based program take a core set of science and statisticscourses and a selection of complementary courses in environ - mental policy. Students are encouraged to gain practical field experience through an internship at one or more of the manypublic and private environmental organizations in the Washing - ton, DC area. Students in the research-based program carry out research projects with faculty in the department, associated andaffiliated faculty at AU, or at one of the many research institu - tions in the Washington, DC area. Graduates will be prepared to engage in high-level, environmental problem solving or pursueadvanced studies in environmental science. The Graduate Certificate in Environmental Assessment is designed to provide students with advanced understanding ofthe environmental impacts of human activities. The programemphasizes the generation, transport, fate, and impact of toxi - cants that affect the environment, with both domestic and inter - national scope. Graduates will be prepared to characterize degraded environments and develop strategies for mitigation orremediation.

Mann Historians explore the past, but the pasts they uncover de - pend on the questions they ask, and historians keep discovering new questions appropriate to their moment in time. Exploringcivilizations across time and space, historians study all the cre - ations of men and women: politics and governments, the arts and the sciences, economic and technological changes, publicand private lives, nations and their peoples. The undergraduate history program introduces students to history broadly, requiring study of ancient, medieval, and mod - ern histories in several geographic contexts before expecting students to specialize. The program's lectures, seminars, anddiscussions facilitate student engagement. Master's and doc -toral students specialize in either United States or modern Euro- pean history and hone research, writing, and analytical skills.The department also offers an M.A. in public history, and publichistory may be taken as an outside field in the doctoral program.Students in American University's History Department have theopportunity to work closely with faculty experts who specializenot only in the U.S., Europe, Latin America, and East Asia, butwhose research focuses on the history of women, the Holo-caust, immigration, politics, and culture. AU History faculty have close, ongoing relationships with major historical institutions in Washington, D.C., such as theNational Archives, Library o f Congress, National Museum of American History, National Building Museum, and the UnitedStates Holocaust Memorial Museum. These provide excellentopportunities for student internships and for their engagementwith public history, which is the presentation of history outsideof the classroom. During the summer, students may participatein the department's popular Civil War and Nuclear Studies Insti - tutes. In addition to preparing students for graduate or law school, the Department of History's emphasis on research, writing, andintellectual problem solving prepares its students for a wide ar - ray of careers in business, government, public interest fields, journalism, and other professions.

Keynes Director of Educational Services B. Jalali Mathematics may be studied as an intellectual discipline for its own sake or as a professional tool for application to the prob-lems of other disciplines. Majors in mathematics receive firmgrounding in the theory and techniques of algebra, analysis, andother fields as a basis for further work in pure or applied mathe - matics and for graduate studies. The major in applied mathe - matics offers training in mathematical problem-solving techniques with a reduced emphasis on abstract theory. Thisprogram is not as firm a foundation for graduate work as themathematics major, but is tailored to the student who will needto apply mathematical, statistical, and computer methods topractical problems. Undergraduates majoring in mathematicsmay choose to take a second major in secondary school teach - ing. Statistics is the science of making decisions based on data. Data and decisions can come from business, law, medicine, pol - itics, science, sociology, and every other field of study, but may be based on incomplete observations or incorrect measure - ments. To mitigate such uncertainties, students studying statis - tics build and apply quantitative tools and techniques for the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presenta - tion of data. They then utilize statistical techniques to discover and investigate patterns, build predictive models, and controlvariability to improve decisionmaking.Undergraduate students majoring in statistics have two tracks available. Those who intend to continue with graduatework in statistics or those with an interest in the theory of statis - tical methods should follow the sequence for mathematical sta - tistics, which requires a strong background in mathematics. Students wishing an emphasis in the use of statistical techniquesshould follow the sequence for applied statistics. This track isespecially appropriate as a secondary emphasis for studentswho have a strong interest in a field of application. The Department of Mathematics and Statistics combines the resources and knowledge of these related disciplines. This en - ables the department to offer unusually varied and flexible pro- grams. A student with an interest in the mathematical sciencesmay choose a program within the department and later changehis or her emphasis without a great loss of time because the pro-grams share a common core. The university's Washington, D.C. location affords the stu- dent access to many governmental, cultural, scientific, and his-torical institutions. These institutions serve as an importantresearch resource. In addition, they are a source of full-time andpart-time employment opportunities for students with a firmgrounding in the mathematical sciences.

North American Studies Economic and social integration has accelerated in North America, but policy coordination and awareness of an emerg - ing North America have not kept pace. The Center for North American Studies (CNAS) at American University aims to ed - ucate a new generation of students from all three coun - tries-Canada, Mexico, and the United States-to begin a North American journey comparable to that begun in Europe five de - cades ago. The course work examines the differences and shared characteristics of the three nations; compares the NorthAmerican experiment with Europe's; and challenges studentsand faculty to imagine a continental future.An undergraduate minor and a graduate certificate are of - fered. These interdisciplinary programs are administered by the College of Arts and Sciences with the support of the School ofInternational Service, School of Public Affairs, School of Com - munication, and the Kogod School of Business. Students pursue an experiential component, based on study abroad in Canada orMexico and/or an internship relevant to North America. Studentsalso need to demonstrate some level of proficiency in Spanish orFrench. The Center for North American Studies hosts SeniorFellows who teach special courses, which can satisfy require - ments with the program coordinator's approval.156 College of Arts and SciencesMinor in North American Studies Admission to the Program Admission to the minor requires a minimum grade point av - erage (GPA) of 2.00 and approval of the program coordinator.

Undergraduate Certificate in Applied Ethics and Professional Responsibility The public is increasingly concerned with matters of ethics in the everyday conduct of professional life. Both as a societyand as members of professional communities, individuals aremeasuring their and others' actions in accordance with ethicalnorms. Ethical engagement demands that actors be able to artic-ulate and justify not only their actions, but also the process ofdecision making behind those actions and its guiding frame- work. The Undergraduate Certificate in Applied Ethics and Pro- fessional Responsibility includes a core in ethics and philoso-phy that offers a foundation on which students build theirunderstanding of professional responsibilities in their chosenfields. Students learn to support and defend their own ethicalpositions and to judge the adequacy of others' claims. They gaininsight into our understanding of right and wrong as well as intojudgments about matters of social justice and human rights, andwill be prepared as members of their professional communitiesto both follow and define ethical guidelines and codes of con - duct. Completing the certificate enhances a student's candidacy for positions in business by signaling to potential employers anappreciation for the complexities of professional life. It alsoprovides students with essential leadership tools, thereby accel - erating their progress beyond the entry level to decision-making positions.

Harshman, T. Larkin Assistant Professor G. Harry, P. Johnson, J. Uscinski The B.S. in Physics, a minor in physics, and a minor and un - dergraduate certificate in applied physics are offered. Courses focus on the study of physical phenomena and properties of theuniverse: gravitation, electricity and magnetism, atomic andnuclear structure, fundamental particles, and the properties ofmatter. The department's faculty is active in research in multiplesubfields of physics including atomic optics, condensed matter,particle physics, physics education, quantum information, andastrophysics. In our high-technology society, people with undergraduate physics backgrounds are employed in research labs and engi - neering fields, work in consulting companies, or pursue gradu - ate studies. Physics graduates are in diverse fields such as astronomy, medicine, engineering, architecture, acoustics, sci - ence education, science policy, as well as physics. Educational facilities include laboratories equipped with modern technology and multiple teaching spaces tailored tofoster interactive learning. Although not a formal requirement,most physics majors participate in undergraduate research ex - periences through internships and independent study.B.S. in Physics Admission to the Program Formal admission to the major requires a grade point aver- age of 2.00 (on a 4.00 scale) and departmental approval.

Preprofessional Programs Pre-engineering Faculty Liaison Teresa Larkin, Department of Physics American University offers a cooperative five-year engi- neering program with the University of Maryland in CollegePark. American University students can combine the advan-tages of both liberal arts and professional education. Studentsare awarded two bachelor's degrees in a five-year period. Students typically spend their first three years on the Ameri - can University campus concentrating in a major field in the Col - lege of Arts and Sciences. Students are strongly encouraged to choose a major field in one of the natural sciences, mathematics,statistics, or computer science at American University. If how - ever, the student chooses to complete a major in the arts, humani - ties, or social sciences, he or she may do so, provided that the engineering program requirements are also satisfied. This optionrequires careful planning and may result in an extra semester ormore of coursework. In the third year, with the recommendation of the pre-engineering faculty liaison, students apply to the engineeringprogram at the University of Maryland. The engineering programoptions at the University of Maryland include aerospace, bioengi - neering, chemical and biomolecular, civil and environmental, electrical and computer, fire protection, materials sciences, andmechanical engineering. After admission to the engineering pro - gram, the fourth year of study is spent there. Once the student completes the requirements for the American University major(generally at the end of the fourth year), the first bachelor's degreeis awarded. After completion of the engineering requirementsduring the fifth year, the student receives a bachelor's degree in engineering from the University of Maryland. Students work closely with the pre-engineering faculty liaison and an advisor in their major field of study. The faculty liaison andadvisor will work together to individually tailor course selectionsto meet the student's interests and needs. Throughout the courseof their studies students should maintain a high grade point aver - age. Completion of basic courses must be done during the first three years of study in order to complete the requirements for anengineering degree in five years. Courses with grades below Cwill not transfer to the University of Maryland. Course Requirements The engineering program at the University of Maryland has basic requirements covering a b road range of study, which must be completed before entrance: /c183Two courses in English composition /c183Calculus I, Calculus II, Calculus III, and differential equations (aerospace majors also take linear algebra) /c183Two years of calculus-based physics with laboratory alongwith courses providing more in-depth study in mechanics,electromagnetism, or thermodynamics /c183One year of general chemistry with laboratory(bioengineering and materials sciences also require onesemester of organic chemistry; chemical engineering alsorequires a two-course sequence in organic chemistry) /c183One course in computer programming /c183Five courses in the humanities and the social sciencesPreprofessional Programs 173Prior to applying to a particular engineering program, students should also have taken ENES 100 Introduction toEngineering Design at the University of Maryland, which isoffered every semester including the summer. Prelaw Prelaw Advisor Tyler Atkins, CAS In considering law school, it is important that the prelaw student understands law schools' educational philosophy. As theLaw School Admission Bulletin states: \"Any course, re - gardless of field, that helps you develop clear and systematic thinking, command of the English language, and a broad un - derstanding of our society constitutes sound preparation for the study of law. Thus, law schools do not recommend specific un - dergraduate majors for prelaw s tudents.\" The prelaw student should also realize that admission to law school is selective.Students contemplating careers in law should plan their under - graduate study to undertake a substantial academic curriculum and acquire a background of outstanding extracurricular activ - ities. Students interested in prelaw preparation follow the normal procedure for declaring and fulfilling requirements for a majorin one of the schools or departments or in gaining approval foran interdisciplinary program of study. Whatever the choice ofmajor, the prelaw student's program should be supported by abroad selection of courses from mathematics, the natural sci-ences, the social sciences, and the humanities. Courses recommended by law schools also include philos- ophy, literature and advanced writing courses, history, politicalscience, accounting, business a dministration, economics, mathematics, languages, and oth er courses demanding logical thinking, analytical reasoning, or verbal proficiency. The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is required of ev - ery applicant to law school. It is strongly recommended that this test be taken in June before the senior year. With this testdate, students can appraise their prospects and consider retak - ing the examination in October or December or both, or, if nec - essary, make alternate plans. Students apply directly to the Law School Admissions Service (LSAS) to take the test on theAmerican University campus an d should register six weeks before the test date. LSAT applications are available from theprelaw advisors. Premedical Programs Premed Programs Coordinator Lynne Arneson202-885-2186premed@american.eduwww.american.edu/cas/premed/ The premedical programs of the College of Arts and Sci - ences are available to help all undergraduate, postbaccalaureate, and graduate students who are consideringa career in medicine or one of the allied health professions.Premedical program services include extensive individual advising on careers, courses, volunteer and research opportuni - ties, professional school examinations, selection of schools, and financial aid. The program also provides seminars by health pro - fessionals, resume preparation and essay writing assistance, medical school interview preparation, preparation of a compos - ite letter of evaluation, and support in compiling and sending letters of recommendation to professional schools. Students from American University applying to medical, dental, or veterinary school have been highly competitive, with86 percent of qualified applicants accepted by medical schools. Advising Services Students interested in the health professions should contact the premedical programs coordinator as soon as possible. Thecoordinator helps students select an appropriate curriculum, pre - pare for the relevant admissions tests, make realistic choices of professional schools, and learn first-hand about biomedical re - search and clinical practice. The coordinator is available to meet with students individually at least once a semester to review theiracademic progress and course of study at American University.Together with students'academic advisors, the coordinator helpsassure timely completion of both degree and premedical require-ments. Typically, at the end of their junior year premedical students submit a primary application to the American Medical CollegesApplication Service, which forwards this general application tospecified schools. Medical schools will then send individual ap-plications to selected students. In order to prepare professional-school applications, each student assembles a file containi ng essential information. Mem- bers of the Premedical Evaluation Committee serve as mentorsfor students. The Writing Center and the Career Center can pro-vide advice about writing personal statements and other docu - ments and interview practice. After the file, including letters of recommendation, is assembled, a comprehensive PremedicalEvaluation Committee letter of evaluation will be prepared tosupport the application. Included in the letter is a summary of theacademic record and extracurricular activities, and an evaluationof commitment to a medical career. Premedical Curriculum Traditionally, premedical students have majored in the natu - ral sciences. However, the medical professions are also seeking well-rounded students with a broadly-based liberal education,reflecting the social, ethical, and cultural roles played by healthcare professionals. Students interested in medical careers maymajor in any field, but must make careful plans to take the neces - sary preparatory courses in a timely fashion. Most health professional schools require certain foundation courses in science and mathematics, along with a full year of col - lege-level writing. All science courses must include laboratory components. Undergraduate stude nts who wish to matriculate at a professional school directly after graduation from AmericanUniversity must submit applications at the end of the junior year.Therefore, the basic requirements should be completed in the174 College of Arts and Sciencesfreshman and sophomore years, following the sequence of courses listed below. Freshman Year BIO-110 General Biology I 5:1 (4) BIO-210 General Biology II 5:2 (4)CHEM-110 General Chemistry I 5:1 (4)CHEM-210 General Chemistry II 5:2 (4)MATH-221 Calculus I (4) Sophomore Year BIO-300 Cell Biology with Laboratory (4) BIO-356 Genetics with Laboratory (5)CHEM-310 Organic Chemistry I (3)CHEM-312 Organic Chemistry I Laboratory (1)CHEM-320 Organic Chemistry II (3)CHEM-322 Organic Chemistry II Laboratory (1) Junior Year PHYS-105 General Physics I 5:1 (4) and PHYS-205 General Physics II 5:2 (4) or PHYS-110 Principles of Physics I 5:1 (4) and PHYS-210 Principles of Physics II 5:2 (4) This intensive plan also prepares students to take the Medi- cal College Admissions Test (MCAT) in the spring of their ju-nior year. To receive most favorable consideration, the Medical Col- lege Admissions Test (MCAT) or Dental Aptitude Test (DAT)must be taken in the spring of the junior year, about 16 monthsbefore matriculation in medical or dental school. Veterinaryschools typically require that the Graduate Record Examination(GRE) be taken at the end of the junior year. The above sequence presumes that a student has already de- cided by the beginning of his or her freshman year to pursue apremedical course of study. Students who do not decide on amedical career until the middle of their undergraduate studies orlater may need to complete their premedical requirements dur - ing summers or in a post-baccalaureate year. Research and Internship Opportunities The premedical program encourages close interaction with the faculty. Many undergraduates have engaged in independentresearch projects in biology, chemistry, physics, and experi - mental psychology which have led to presentation and publica - tion of papers. Many opportunities for internships, volunteer work, and biomedical research are available. Local hospitals and clinicsprovide students with clinical experience. At institutions suchas the National Institutes of Health and other local laboratoriesand biotechnology companies, students may gain first-hand ba - sic research experience in biochemistry, immunology, molecu - lar biology, and molecular genetics. Premedical Achievement Prize and Scholarship The American University Hassa S. Shanker Premedical Achievement Prize is a $2,000 cash award presented to themost outstanding undergraduate student intending to apply to a health professional school who has taken at least five scienceand mathematics courses at American University. Selection isbased on academic achievements, leadership qualities, and con - tributions to society or the health professions. Applicants must be planning to apply to medical, dental, or veterinary school, orto a program in the health sciences, such as physical therapy. The Josephine G. Gimble Scholarship is a $2,000 annual award to an undergraduate or postbaccalaureate student prepar - ing for a career in the allied health sciences. Postbaccalaureate Premedical Certificate Certificate Coordinator Lynne Arneson, 202-885-2186premed@american.eduwww.american.edu/cas/premed/CERT-GPMD.cfm Postbaccalaureate work consists of academic study under - taken after earning a bachelor's degree. American University's Postbaccalaureate Premedical Certificate program is designedto complete basic requirements a nd strengthen credentials for application to health professional schools of human medicine(M.D. or D.O.), dentistry (D.D.S.), veterinary medicine(D.V oral sur - gery (D.M.D.), and to advanced degree programs in the allied health sciences such as public health (M.P.H.) and physician as-sistant, nurse practitioner, and physical therapy programs lead-ing to the M.S. or Ph.D. degree. This program offers students extensive guidance and assis- tance in preparing for professional school and a career. With thehelp of advisors they polish resume and essay-writing skills,prepare for the Medical College Aptitude Test (MCAT) or otheradmissions examinations, practice medical school interviews,select potential professional schools, and address related finan-cial issues. Through the program, students may also attend sem-inars by health professionals, identify volunteer opportunities,and be matched with a mentor. Each emerges with a compositeletter of evaluation, held with letters of recommendation in apersonal file. The premedical pr ograms coordinator sends these letters to professional schools f or students and assists them in meeting all application deadlines.

Ag - ing populations, global pandemics, increasing environmental degradation and a rise in childhood obesity are just some of themany challenges to which the field of public health directly re - sponds. Because public health is a highly interdisciplinary area of study, students in the program benefit from interactions withscholars from across the university. After gaining foundationalknowledge and practical skills in the field by completing a setof core courses, students explore the complexities of publichealth by selecting elective courses from clusters in globalhealth; health science; policy, program planning, and evalua - tion; and social and community health. Students' growth in the field is furthered through internships in the Washington, DCarea and health-related study abroad opportunities. Finally, thecapstone course engages students in synthesizing their experi - ence and understanding of the field of public health. Students in the B.A. and B.S. programs have access to simi - lar courses. Students pursuing the B.A. may want to focus on courses that support careers in program planning, the develop -ment and assessment of public health projects, and the social and community health aspects of public health. Students pursu - ing the B.S. degree may be more interested in public health re - search, in future work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or in developing vaccination protocols.

Nothaft Sociology explores how individuals, through their collec - tive actions, create and change patterns of social relations and how, in turn, these social relations influence people's lives. So - ciologists focus on three major levels of analysis, from whole societies as component parts of wider systems, to institutionsas component sectors of society, to individuals as participantsin two-person groups. They also study varied processes of so - cial change, from migration to social mobility, from urbaniza - tion to mass communication. Finally, sociologists study a wide variety of themes, from racial and ethnic relations to socialproblems and political change. This quest for knowledge isboth an end in itself and a pathway for informed social change. The Department of Sociology of the College of Arts and Sciences shares a common purpose of education and researchfor social justice in an increasi ngly global social system. Fac - ulty and students are empowered to participate in building eq - uitable, humane, and sustainable social institutions by creating sociological knowledge and applying professional researchskills to produce effective policies and programs for socialchange. One source of its strength is the department's multicultural diversity, which its members take every opportu-nity to expand. The Sociology Department serves the university, including students from throughout the world, as a center for the study ofsocietal change, social institutions, and social processes, with anemphasis on inequality and social justice. Degree programs fo-cus on forms of inequality, their origins and patterns or reproduc-tion, related to issues of social justice, and how these issues varywithin and between societies. They are intended to produce andapply knowledge for the benefit of society, not only to teach aca - demic skills, but also to develop knowledge of value to those in - volved in working for the promotion of social equality. The programs prepare students for a variety of careers in social advo - cacy, research, teaching, human services, and both public and private sector policy-making institutions. Successful placementsof the department's graduates in academic, research, and pol - icy-making institutions attest to the high standards our graduates meet. The department's focus on international and comparative so - ciology and public sociology are especially well suited to Wash - ington, D.C., an international capital and center for policy making. American University's location provides unparalleledaccess to government, research in stitutions, data and archival sources, advocacy organizations, and leaders involved in socialchange. The undergraduate program is unique in its emphasis on race, gender, social justice, global social change and appliedsociology/social policy. Majors and minors take core course se - quences in sociological theory and research methods, and courses from several areas of concentration. Membership in theAmerican University chapter of Alpha Kappa Delta, the interna - tional honor society in Sociology, is open to qualifying majors.184 College of Arts and SciencesThe society sponsors lectures and other activities that involve undergraduates in the professional workings of the discipline. In collaboration with the Department of Biology and other departments, an interdisciplinary B.A. or B.S. in Public Health,as well a minor, are available to students. The Department of Sociology's graduate program consists of core training in sociological theory and research method,plus an area of concentration in public sociology, race, gender,and social justice; global sociology; social inequality; or genderand family. The program not only teaches academic skills, butalso develops knowledge of benefit to those working for thepromotion of social equality. Course are designed to enable stu - dents to deepen their knowledge of a specialty area, to develop advanced and systematic theoretical understanding, and to de - velop methodological areas for vocational and professional competence.

A list of the faculty members of theWomen's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Advisory Board andother program information is available at:www.american.edu/cas/wgs/ The Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) Pro - gram is an interdisciplinary program encompassing feminist studies, masculinity studies, and sexuality studies. The programis committed to a multicultural curriculum that sustains and in-tegrates diverse perspectives. Program courses emphasize par-ticipatory education in which student involvement, criticalthinking, and personal insight are encouraged and made rele-vant in the learning process. Many faculty members with na-tional and international reputations for their scholarly work onwomen's/gender/sexuality issu es regularly teach women's, gender, and sexuality studies courses, as well as courses in otherdepartments and programs that count toward the major and mi-nor. Students who major or minor in WGSS gain experience off-campus in the nation's capital through an internship place - ment in an organization or agency whose mission embraces some aspect of women's/gende r/sexuality studies. Students have access to powerful networks in Washington, DC that cangive substantial support in career development; student internsare actively sought by organizations focused on the arts, advo - cacy of all kinds, communication, employment and training is - sues, law and policy, reproductive rights and health, social research in a wide range of fields, support services for survivorsof violence and abuse, and U.S. politics. The program also en - courages and facilitates students' study abroad. Majors and mi - nors have expanded their understanding of women's/gender/sexuality in programs in Africa, Asia, Europeand Latin America. A degree in WGSS leads to challenging careers in a wide spectrum of occupations. An undergraduate education inWGSS also equips students with a range of skills which arehighly valued in the twenty-first century labor force. The cur - riculum also prepares students for graduate study in the fields of women's/gender/sexuality studies or for advanced study in tra - ditional disciplines and professional fields. Moreover, at AUstudents can earn a graduate certificate in women's, gender, and sexuality studies by combining graduate-level coursework onwomen's/gender/sexuality theory and current issues/research inWGSS with approved graduate coursework from a range ofparticipating graduate programs.

LeoGrande Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Margaret A. Weekes The School of Public Affairs is committed to education and research programs in the field of public affairs. An interest inpublic affairs reflects a concern for people and how they inter - act with government institutions and political and legal sys - tems. Students are able to pursue this interest through a comprehensive educational experience that includes classroominstruction, individual research, and practical professionaltraining. Through its three departments\u2014the Department ofGovernment, the Department of Justice, Law and Society, andthe Department of Public Administration and Policy\u2014theschool provides a comprehensive and unified approach to thestudy of public affairs in the United States and around theworld. Each program is designed to focus on specific career in-terests, including careers in government and not-for-profit orga-nizations, but all are multidisciplinary, issue and policyoriented, and adapted to Washington's unique educational op-portunities. Washington is an ideal location for studying public affairs. As the site of national government and as a world capital, thecity provides students with vivid evidence of the interrelation - ships of domestic and international politics. Students can ob - serve first hand the political, economic, and environmental forces shaping public affairs and public policy. As an integralpart of the curriculum, internships in private and public organi - zations lend a practical dimension to the academic programs and provide the opportunity to interact with policy makers.Washington's facilities for scholarly research and personal en - richment include such government institutions as the Library of Congress, the National Archives, and the Smithsonian Institu - tion, as well as many departmental and agency libraries. The school has more than 50 active full time faculty mem - bers including both nationally and internationally recognized scholars and others distinguished by their public service. Aug - menting the full time faculty is an adjunct faculty of eminent government officials and public affairs practitioners who bringto the classroom the special insights acquired in their profes - sional experience. Drawing on the facilities of the university, the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area, and theWashington community, the School offers a unique combina - tion of resources for study and practical experience in the field of public affairs. The school's comprehensive range of aca - demic and professional programs leads to degrees at the bache - lor's, master's, and doctoral levels. Undergraduate Study Undergraduate students may plan their academic programs to meet personalized learning objectives. Recognizing that amultidisciplinary education is required to meet the ever chang - ing nature of the public affairs profession, advisors encouragestudents to take courses in other academic units. Graduate Study The graduate degree programs in the School of Public Af- fairs serve a number of diverse educational needs. Most of ourmaster's programs educate students for specific professionalcareers in government and other nonprofit organizations at lo-cal, state, and national levels. These programs emphasize man-agerial, analytical, and conceptual skills necessary forprofessional success and leadership in public service. Othersprovide students with a general understanding of the academicdisciplines related to public affairs. Doctoral programs are de - signed to prepare qualified indi viduals for professional appoint - ments in teaching, scholarly research, and executive management and are offered in political science, public admin - istration, and justice, law and society. Internships The school encourages qualified students to work for course credit as interns in governmental, political, non-profit, and pri - vate organizations. These internships are designed to give stu - dents practical involvement in political processes or action programs. For example, a student might work for a member ofCongress, the Department of State, the Department of Justice,or for other organizations directly concerned with public policy. Independent Study The School of Public Affairs encourages students to engage in independent study projects related to their fields of interest.These projects include reading, research, and field work in theWashington area arranged directly with a faculty member. Study Abroad AU Abroad offers the opportunity for students to study abroad and gain full American University course credit. All stu - dents are encouraged to learn and work in another culture. Stu - 271dents may spend a semester or year at prestigious universities in over 40 countries, spanning six continents.

Under special circumstances,students may take a second field outside AmericanUniversity, subject to the approval of the SPA graduatedirector, in consultation with the department's faculty advisorfor the PhD program. /c183The Ph.D. is fundamentally a degree in preparation for an academic career of research and teaching. Understandingscientific inquiry and correctly using research techniquesrequire extensive preparation. All students in the programtake four courses in research methods designed to helpdoctoral students comprehend the nature of science andmaster tools of research (see Course Requirements, below). Each student selects a specialization in which to complete an original research project under the direction of programfaculty and write a dissertation. Students may chooseresearch projects within one of the major areas. It is theresponsibility of the student to secure the agreement of aDepartment of Government full-time tenured or tenure-trackfaculty member to serve as the chair of the dissertationcommittee. One of the other two members of the committeemay be from outside SPA. As part of this process, eachstudent must publicly defend the research proposal before thedissertation committee and other interested faculty. Thecommittee and the chair of the department, in consultationwith the SPA director of doctoral programs, must approve theresearch proposal in order for the candidate to advance tocandidacy. As work on the dissertation project progresses, students register for dissertation credit. Substantive course work maybe used as part of this requirement where it contributesdirectly to the research specialization and is specificallyrecommended by the dissertation committee chair. Upon writing the dissertation, the candidate submits the manuscript to the dissertation committee for review. If thecommittee members approve the dissertation, the candidatemust complete an oral defense of it, including demonstrablemastery of related literature on the general field in which itlies before the committee and other interested faculty. Afterhearing the candidate's defense, the committee decideswhether the dissertation is acceptable as the culminatingwork of the student's doctoral career.

Young Acting Assistant Professor S. Tankel The Department of Justice, Law and Society (DJLS) has one of the oldest programs in the field of justice in the UnitedStates. The full-time faculty in the department have educationalbackgrounds in law, criminology, criminal justice, philosophy,political science, sociology, psychology, and history. The de-partment offers the Bachelor of Arts in Justice and Law and inLaw and Society, Master of Science in Justice, Law and Soci-ety; a dual Juris Doctor and Master of Science program with theWashington College of Law, and the Ph.D. in Justice, Law andSociety. The B.A. in Justice and Law, with concentrations in crimi- nal justice or criminology, analyzes the foundations, functions,policies, and procedures of justice. Crime and deviance are seri-ous public policy concerns in American society, and systems ofjustice are the main public policy responses for dealing withthese problems. Cross-cultural and international perspectivesare brought to bear when they shed light on the nature of crimeand deviance in America or on the workings of American sys - tems of justice. The B.A. in Law and Society, with concentra - tions in the humanities or social sciences, is an interdisciplinary program that examines the role of law in relation to social, polit - ical, and economic institutions. The complex relation of law and justice, broadly conceived, is the central consideration inthis program of study. Drawing on the social sciences and hu - manities, this curriculum offers an historical and international perspective on legal issues. Both undergraduate majors can beconsidered prelaw majors. The M.S. in Justice, Law and Society further elaborates on the central concerns of the undergraduate degrees offered inDJLS. The M.S. concentration in justice and public policy of - fers theoretical and applied grounding in criminology and crim - inal justice issues, including all levels of policing and corrections. The concentration in terrorism and security policyfocuses on national security as well as the causes of terrorismand policy affecting its prevention. Law and society is an inter - disciplinary approach to the role of law in society including the -oretical legal foundations and law as it relates to the social sci - ences and issues of social justice. The jurisprudence and social thought concentration emphasizes both philosophical andcomparative perspectives on law and analytical thought. The department's programs prepare students for law school and further graduate study, as well as for entry-level positionsand professional careers in the justice field. Washington, D.C.provides a source of cooperative education and internshipplacements, which often lead to challenging employment B.A. in Justice and Law Admission to the Program New freshman and transfer students are admitted through the Office of Admissions. Current students who wish to transferinto the department or develop a double major should have agrade point average of 2.50 or higher and the approval of theundergraduate academic advisor.

Students must apply to and be accepted by both the Washington College of Law andthe Department of Justice, Law and Society. Admission to ei - ther the M.S. or J.D. program in no way implies that admissionto both programs will be granted. Students may apply to both programs simultaneously or be - gin either program separately and then apply to the other pro - gram. However, once the study of law has begun, no justicecourses can be taken until one full year of full-time law studyhas been completed. Admission criteria are the same as those for the M.S. in Jus - tice, Law and Society. If application is made initially to theWashington College of Law (WCL), LSAT scores are acceptedin place of GRE general scores and application materials sub - mitted to the WCL are reviewed for admission to the Depart - ment of Justice, Law and Society.

The law advisor must approve thejustice courses and the justice advisor must approve the lawcourses in advance of taking the courses to be applied towardboth degrees. Ph.D. in Justice, Law and Society Admission to the Program Applicants are considered and admitted for the fall semester only. February 1 is the deadline for application for admission. All applicants must submit scores from the Graduate RecordExamination (GRE). The normal minimum for consideration isa grade point average of 3.20 (on a 4.00 scale) in all previousacademic work. Preference will be given to applicants forfull-time study, although highly qualified students may be ad - mitted for part-time study. Major Field Justice, Law and Society Degree Requirements /c18372 credit hours of approved graduate work is required for students entering the program with a bachelor's degree; aminimum of 48 credit hours is required of students who havecompleted an approved master's degree. A minimum grade point average of 3.2 in all course work is required to remain in good standing and to earn the degree. /c183Advancement to candidacy is accomplished by successfullycompleting a written qualifying examination at the end of thesecond semester of study.School of Public Affairs 287/c183Students take two written comprehensive examinations, the first in either justice or law and society. The second may bethe other of these two fields or may be any other major field.Following completion of the written examinations, allstudents take an oral examination on their entire program ofstudy before a committee of faculty members, and defendtheir dissertation proposal. Students take a primary field comprehensive examination in justice or law and society. They take a secondary fieldcomprehensive examination in the other field, or they maytake a second field elsewhere in the School of Public Affairs(SPA), the School of International Service, or in anotherdoctoral degree-granting teaching unit. Under specialcircumstances, students may take a second field outsideAmerican University, subject to the approval of the SPAgraduate director, in consultation with the department. /c183The Ph.D. is fundamentally a research degree. Understanding scientific inquiry and correctly using research techniquesrequire extensive preparation. All students in the programtake three courses designed to help doctoral studentscomprehend the nature of science and master tools ofresearch (see Course Requirements, below). Each student selects a specialization in which to complete an original research project under the direction of programfaculty and write a dissertation. Students may chooseresearch projects within one of the major areas or select aresearch specialization from one of the other graduate fieldswithin the school. Each student prepares a research proposal for the dissertation project. It is the responsibility of the student to secure theagreement of a School of Public Affairs full-time tenured ortenure-track faculty member to serve as the chair of thedissertation committee. One of the two other members of thecommittee may be from outside SPA. As part of this process,each student must publicly defend the research proposalbefore the dissertation committee and other interested faculty.The committee and the SPA director of doctoral programs(acting for the dean) must approve the defense and theresearch proposal. The topic covered by the proposal must berelated to ongoing research or publications of the supervisingfaculty. As work on the dissertation project progresses, students register dissertation credit. Substantive course work may beused as part of this requirement where it contributes directlyto the research specialization and is specificallyrecommended by the dissertation committee chair. Upon completion of the research and the written dissertation, the candidate submits the manuscript to the dissertationcommittee for review. If the committee members approve themanuscript, the candidate must complete an oral defense ofthe dissertation and the general field in which it lies before thecommittee and other interested faculty.

DPAPis the only department in the nation to have three master's pro - grams accredited by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA).The UnitedStates and other governments worldwide face the challenge ofdiscerning how best to harness the energy and expertise of pub - lic servants, the passion and commitment of nonprofit organiza - tions, and the dynamism and creativity of markets in the pursuit of democratic and constitutionally informed public purposes.We educate students entering, engaged in, and interacting withgovernment agencies in the U.S. and abroad. We treat adminis - tration and policy as interrelated subjects strongly influencedby the values of public service and democratic constitutionalism. Through our research and civic involve - ment, we also seek to shape and enhance what is practiced and taught in our field.
