Q: What can I expect at my initial visit? A: During your initial visit Dr. Frigerio will spend two hours carefully reviewing your health history, determining a treatment protocol, and, if appropriate, administering a treatment. After the initial visit, appointments last for approximately one hour and consist of a follow-up consultation and acupuncture treatment. Q: How are naturopathic doctors (ND's) trained? A: Naturopathic physicians are primary-care general practitioners of natural medicine. As in conventional medical school, applicants must show competency in specific, premedical requirements before being accepted to a U.S. Department of Education-accredited naturopathic medical school. After acceptance, ND candidates complete a rigorous, four-year academic and clinical program. This program combines the study of western medical sciences (such as anatomy, physiology, pathology, microbiology, immunology, clinical and physical diagnosis, laboratory diagnosis, cardiology, gastroenterology, gynecology, etc.) with naturopathic therapeutics and philosophy. Training also includes an applied, clinical apprenticeship during the last two years. Naturopathic physicians must then pass standardized, federal, and state licensing exams to obtain a license. Because ND's are not licensed in the state of New Jersey, be sure to find out if the practitioner you are considering attended an accredited school. Q: Will my insurance cover treatments? A: Many health insurance plans cover acupuncture treatment. The percentage of coverage may be different, depending on the policy of your company and the program you selected. We suggest you call your employee benefits office or insurance company directly for details. Q: Can you be my primary care physician? A: New Jersey currently does not license Doctors of Naturopathy. So, Dr. Frigerio does not practice medicine as a primary care provider. He focuses on education, uncovering causes of illness, nutrition counseling for optimal health and, when the situation warrants, works with conventional physicians. If you are on medications that were prescribed by another physician, he can discuss options regarding the management of your current medications. Q: Do you work with other doctors? A: Yes. There are a number of doctors and other practitioners (MD, DC, LAc) that we work with on a regular basis. Q: Can you order lab/ blood work? A: We work with a number of labs but do not draw blood in the office. Dr. Frigerio is willing to go over any blood work that you have done through your primary care physician. Q: What kind of testing do we do? A: We offer a variety of testing in our office including allergy testing, genetics, stool, and saliva. Q: Where should I get my supplements? A: You may have been told that some supplements can be harmful and dangerous in high doses, such as vitamin A, and this is medical fact. Supplements should never be taken without approval by a qualified practitioner. When needed, we only use the highest grade supplements possible. We believe it is better to take no supplements at all than to buy supplements at a retail store since they often tend not to contain any beneficial active ingredients. They may also contain harmful fillers, the wrong part of the plant/herb, non-absorbable vitamins, or unknown substances. Q: What can I expect from an acupuncture treatment? A: Typically, patients find an acupuncture treatment to be a relaxing experience. (This is especially true after they get over any initial hesitation regarding needles.) The needles used in acupuncture are extremely thin and sterile so the sensation you feel when being needled is fairly minimal. In some areas, you will feel almost nothing, while in others the needle will be rotated slightly until you feel a heavy or distended feeling indicating the arrival of Qi. After the needles are inserted, you are left to relax for about 15 - 25 minutes. \"I was in a panic when I first met Jason Frigerio. I had tried what seemed like every antidepressant that Western medicine had to offer; I was tired, desperate and ready to give up. I was anxious and fretful; I felt as if I were to blame for everyone's problems. A colleague recommended acupuncture & naturopathy to me; I was skeptical but not anymore. I feel listened to and cared for. Dr. Frigerio is wise and intuitive, always taking time to listen to every aspect of my life: personal, professional, and physical. He skillfully ponders each piece of my history and creates a treatment plan. I am eternally grateful to have gained a new sense of peace and internal strength under "}
