Pregnant women are also at increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes to many vaccine-preventable diseases. Several models have been proposed to describe factors informing vaccine hesitancy and acceptance. However, none of these existing models are applicable to the complex decision-making involved with vaccine acceptance during pregnancy. We propose a model for vaccine decision-making in pregnancy that incorporates the following key factors: (1) perceived information sufficiency regarding vaccination risks during pregnancy, (2) harm avoidance to protect the fetus, (3) relationship with a healthcare provider, (4) perceived benefits of vaccination, and (5) perceived disease susceptibility and severity during pregnancy. In addition to these factors, the availability of research on vaccine safety during pregnancy, social determinants of health, structural barriers to vaccine access, prior vaccine acceptance, and trust in the healthcare system play roles in decision-making. As a final step, the pregnant individual must balance the risks and benefits of vaccination for themselves and their fetus, which adds greater complexity to the decision. Our model represents a first step in synthesizing factors informing vaccine decision-making by pregnant women, who represent a highly vaccine-resistant population and who are also at high risk for adverse outcomes for many infectious diseases.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-07-17", "cleaned_text": "A Mother's Dilemma: The 5-P Model for Vaccine Decision-Making play a crucial role in protecting the health of pregnant women and fetuses due to maternal antibody transfer across the placenta and through breast milk after birth. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend that women receive several vaccines during pregnancy, including vaccines for pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, polio, influenza, and coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01248)]. Despite these recommendations, pregnant individuals are highly vaccine-hesitant. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination rates for COVID-19 remained lower among pregnant versus non-pregnant women, even though contracting COVID-19 during pregnancy conferred a greater risk for adverse outcomes [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-01248), [15](#B15-vaccines-11-01248)]. A significant knowledge gap exists regarding the factors influencing vaccine decision-making in pregnancy. [16](#B16-vaccines-11-01248)]. Despite the existence of many clinical practice guidelines regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnancy, there was an information gap between experts in pregnancy vaccination and the pregnant lay public [ [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01248)]. Historically, pregnant women have also been excluded from clinical vaccine trials, which contributes to a lack of confidence as to the safety of vaccines for them or their fetuses [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01248), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-01248)]. Perceived insufficiency of data regarding vaccine safety for the fetus is a common reason for vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-01248), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01248)]. An information gap and lack of research and public health messaging around vaccines and the concerns of pregnant or reproductive-aged women has led to disinformation linking vaccination to adverse fertility or pregnancy outcomes. To address these barriers, we launched a limited public health campaign and research program, called One Vax Two Lives, during the COVID-19 pandemic [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-01248), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-01248)]. However, without a vaccine-decision-making model in pregnancy, a public health campaign is likely to miss key factors driving uptake. [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01248), [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01248), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01248)], 3C [ models [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-01248)]. Pregnancy represents an intense information-seeking phase in life, in which pregnant women face heightened awareness of the impact of their health decisions on their fetuses; the sensitivity of this decision also increases vulnerability to disinformation. The unique complexity of pregnancy is not captured by any of the general models of health behavior or vaccine hesitancy. Our objective is to highlight the challenges of vaccine decision-making in pregnancy and to present a new vaccine-acceptance model that can be used to inform public health campaigns and provider-patient interactions targeting pregnant women. We begin by exploring barriers to vaccination in pregnancy. Secondly, we address current vaccine-acceptance models and the ways in which they can and cannot be applied to pregnant individuals as decision-makers. Finally, we propose a new 5-P model for vaccine decision-making in pregnancy and address how these factors influence vaccination and other health decisions of pregnant individuals. 2. Barriers to Vaccination in Pregnancy [29](#B29-vaccines-11-01248)]. Early reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy involved the concern about the lack of data regarding its safety during pregnancy [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01248), [31](#B31-vaccines-11-01248), [32](#B32-vaccines-11-01248), [33](#B33-vaccines-11-01248)]. For pregnant individuals, vaccine safety was initially unknown, as pregnant and lactating individuals were not included in the initial Phase 3 studies [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01248)]. One study found that 98.7% of pregnant respondents were aware that there was a COVID-19 vaccine available but very few were knowledgeable about the vaccine [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-01248)]. Furthermore, the available information about vaccination in pregnancy was often contradictory, making it difficult to know what was accurate and further enhancing skepticism about the vaccine's efficacy and safety [ [34](#B34-vaccines-11-01248)]. The internet and social media were significant sources of misinformation, perpetuating confusion and vaccine hesitancy. Concern about the COVID-19 vaccine's efficacy was also a reason for vaccine hesitancy in pregnant and breastfeeding individuals [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-01248), [33](#B33-vaccines-11-01248), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-01248)]. In addition to pregnancy-specific and other attitudinal barriers to vaccination in pregnancy, there are also many other structural barriers to vaccination (e.g., access, affordability, trust in science), which are addressed in many vaccine-acceptance models designed for the general population. 3. Models of Vaccine Acceptance [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01248), [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01248), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01248)], which was generally designed to describe factors informing health decision-making. The HBM is divided into several categories: perceived susceptibility to the disease, perceived severity of the disease, perceived benefits of the disease-prevention behavior, barriers to the disease-prevention behavior, a cue to action, and self-efficacy. The cue to action represents events, people, or things that help trigger a change in health behavior. Self-efficacy refers to one's confidence in the health behavior, which could represent one's trust and confidence that vaccination is a healthy choice. [26](#B26-vaccines-11-01248)]. Confidence can be described as a belief in the safety of vaccines, the reliability of the healthcare systems that deliver them, and the motivations of policymakers. Complacency can be described as belief (or lack thereof) in the necessity of the vaccine with respect to other life responsibilities. Convenience can be described as the access to and affordability of the vaccine for those who want it. This was expanded in 2015 in the 4C model to include a utility calculation, where the benefits of the vaccine play a larger role [ [27](#B27-vaccines-11-01248)]. In 2016, the 5A model was developed, in which vaccine acceptance was described in terms of access, affordability, awareness, acceptance, and activation [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-01248)]. The factors, strengths, and limitations are described with respect to vaccination and vaccination in pregnancy in [Table 1](#vaccines-11-01248-t001). [35](#B35-vaccines-11-01248)]. This model describes three themes in the decisions of pregnant people: uncertainty, bodily autonomy, and being a good mother. These three themes are interlinked with three actions: information gathering, balancing aspects of a choice, and aligning with a birth philosophy. This model is also inspired by the knowledge that choices during pregnancy cannot be simplified to weighing the pros and cons of medical actions. Instead, it is impacted by perceptions of birth as a natural process or a medical process, desires to maintain body autonomy and independent choice, and stressors of pregnancy [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-01248)]. Application of this model to vaccine decision-making addresses, in part, many of the limitations of more traditional decision-making models by describing specifically how safety and perceived worth impact health decisions in pregnancy. However, vaccine decision-making in pregnancy is even more complex, which we describe in a new model. 4. The 5-P Vaccine Acceptance Model in Pregnancy [Table 1](#vaccines-11-01248-t001)are easily applied to the general population, pregnant women have a more complex decision-making process that generally involves balancing risks and benefits for themselves and the fetus [ [36](#B36-vaccines-11-01248), [37](#B37-vaccines-11-01248)]. We now propose a 5-P model of vaccine acceptance in pregnancy that combines our clinical experience, features of the HBM, and a pregnancy decision-making model [ [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01248), [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01248), [35](#B35-vaccines-11-01248), [37](#B37-vaccines-11-01248)]. By drawing on these models [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01248), [35](#B35-vaccines-11-01248)], literature review as a research methodology [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-01248)], as well as our experience from the One Vax Two Lives COVID-19 research and public health campaign [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-01248), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-01248)], we can address key elements unique to pregnancy decision-making. [39](#B39-vaccines-11-01248)]. Race and ethnicity are other modifying factors. Historically, Black and Latinx people have shown greater vaccine hesitancy and lower vaccine uptake. This can be accredited to barriers to health behavior created by racism and a history of harm perpetuated by the medical field on these communities. A 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 45% of Black patients had experienced negative experiences with a healthcare provider [ [40](#B40-vaccines-11-01248)]. Vaccine decision-making in pregnancy clearly exists on the background of a person's socioeconomic, geographic, educational, and racial/ethnic identity. [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-01248-f001), [Table 2](#vaccines-11-01248-t002)). Two themes regarding decision-making in the pregnancy model, uncertainty and bodily autonomy, ultimately play into the \"perceived information sufficiency\" and \"balancing pros and cons for mother and fetus\" elements of our model, respectively. Additional elements that are more universal in medical decision-making also contribute to vaccine decision-making in pregnancy and can be positive, negative, or neutral factors in the ultimate decision. The final step in the process requires a careful balancing of the risks and benefits for oneself and one's fetus, which can be a taxing process given the many inputs into the decision, including, potentially, the partner's opinion. Prior vaccine acceptance and trust can also be a determinant of vaccine decision-making but was not included as a key component of the 5-P model. Overall, vaccination during pregnancy is a complex decision. Unique pregnancy-specific factors must be considered in addition to other factors applicable to the general population in understanding the decision-making process. 4.1. Perceived Information Sufficiency [52](#B52-vaccines-11-01248)]. Information trusted by pregnant women influences health decisions, behavior, and vaccine acceptance [ [53](#B53-vaccines-11-01248)]. Information sufficiency is also shown to positively influence pregnancy satisfaction [ [54](#B54-vaccines-11-01248)]. It has also been shown that for many women, vaccine decision-making for the infant commences during their pregnancy [ [52](#B52-vaccines-11-01248)]. Given the heightened risk to pregnant women that COVID-19 presents, numerous studies have shown that pregnant women are highly engaged in information-seeking behavior related to COVID-19 infection and vaccines [ [53](#B53-vaccines-11-01248)]. Conversely, in a study of COVID-19 vaccine uptake during pregnancy, the most cited reason for hesitancy was a lack of knowledge about the vaccine [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-01248)]. Lack of data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for pregnant women, combined with inconsistent messaging in government advice and guidelines, contributed to vaccine hesitancy and lower vaccine uptake among pregnant women [ [55](#B55-vaccines-11-01248)]. Exclusion of pregnant individuals from vaccine trials and misinformation about the vaccine's effects on the fetus and fertility are further barriers to obtaining information regarding pregnancy ( [Table 2](#vaccines-11-01248-t002)). Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals have lacked the same assurances from clinical research as the general population, leaving them to make vaccination choices without reliable data on the associated risks to themselves and their fetus or child due to the absence of evidence-based data [ [56](#B56-vaccines-11-01248)]. 4.2. Pregnancy Protection of the Mother and Fetus (Harm Avoidance) [Table 2](#vaccines-11-01248-t002)) [ [42](#B42-vaccines-11-01248)]. It can also be potentially detrimental, such as in the case of self-discontinuation of important medications without the advice or supervision of a physician. The desire to avoid potential teratogenic effects has been the motivating factor for people when discontinuing medications like anti-epilepsy medication and psychotropic medications ( [Table 2](#vaccines-11-01248-t002)) [ [43](#B43-vaccines-11-01248), [57](#B57-vaccines-11-01248)]. [58](#B58-vaccines-11-01248)]. In a Canadian study, perceived personal risk of COVID-19 was not a predictor of a pregnant person's vaccine acceptance, indicating that for those who were vaccine-hesitant, perceived risk of the vaccine outweighed perceived risk of the illness [ [59](#B59-vaccines-11-01248)]. Here, the avoidance of risk trumped any possible vaccine benefit. Understanding the hierarchy of priorities is helpful for understanding vaccine uptake during pregnancy. If there is a question about the potential for the vaccine to harm the fetus, the pregnant individual may simply avoid vaccination. 4.3. Provider-Patient Relationship [60](#B60-vaccines-11-01248), [61](#B61-vaccines-11-01248)]. Pregnant people indicate that they are more willing to receive vaccines if they received a recommendation from their provider to do so [ [62](#B62-vaccines-11-01248)]. In one study, participants who were ranked as highly likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine identified physicians to be their main source of COVID-19 vaccine information, and 37% indicated that a physician recommendation would reduce their vaccine hesitancy [ [63](#B63-vaccines-11-01248)]. [64](#B64-vaccines-11-01248)]. We propose that the relationship between a pregnant woman and her obstetric or primary care provider is a critical piece in the decision to vaccinate during pregnancy and enables the pregnant woman to feel empowered to make a decision. [65](#B65-vaccines-11-01248)]. However, a study conducted with pregnant women from Latin America found many women received vaccinations without consulting family or friends, and only a few considered the opinions of family members or male partners [ [66](#B66-vaccines-11-01248)]. Although the influence of partners and family is important, the opinion of healthcare providers, whether that be physicians or community health workers, appears to supersede that of family and partner as a key determinant for vaccine uptake. 4.4. Perceived Benefits [60](#B60-vaccines-11-01248), [67](#B67-vaccines-11-01248)]. Pregnant individuals with beliefs that the COVID-19 vaccine carried benefits were less vaccine-hesitant and more likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or report an intent to vaccinate [ [36](#B36-vaccines-11-01248), [68](#B68-vaccines-11-01248), [69](#B69-vaccines-11-01248)]. In a Canadian study, self-protection was identified by 65% of respondents as their primary reason for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine [ [59](#B59-vaccines-11-01248)]. A cross-sectional survey among pregnant women in three U.S. cities found that protection of the fetus/newborn was the most common reason for vaccine acceptance among those who reported intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [ [70](#B70-vaccines-11-01248)]. A study on messaging for the seasonal influenza vaccine directed toward pregnant women found that an emphasis on vaccine benefits for the fetus had a positive impact on maternal vaccine confidence [ [71](#B71-vaccines-11-01248)]. Researchers have called for research on vaccines for pregnant and breastfeeding women to be prioritized, as data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine during both pregnancy and breastfeeding would likely contribute to the perceived benefits of the vaccine and, ultimately, vaccine uptake [ [72](#B72-vaccines-11-01248)]. 4.5. Perceived Susceptibility and Severity of Disease in Pregnancy [34](#B34-vaccines-11-01248)]. The perceived severity of COVID-19 disease for a pregnant individual is two-pronged, as it involves how both the mother and the infant will be affected. In both cases, a combined perception of the consequences of disease on both individuals plays into the decision on whether contracting the disease will be more or less harmful than getting the vaccine. For COVID-19, the perceived threat of infection was not a direct indicator of willingness to receive the vaccine, as those who believed COVID-19 to be a serious threat were not always willing to receive the vaccine [ [59](#B59-vaccines-11-01248)]. Multiple studies have shown statistically significant differences in perceived severity of disease between those who get vaccinated and those who do not [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01248), [73](#B73-vaccines-11-01248)]. Interestingly, in one study, perceived threat was not a significant indicator of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy, suggesting that a potential lack of education, awareness, or perhaps even lack of belief in the consequences of COVID-19 disease may contribute to vaccine resistance [ [36](#B36-vaccines-11-01248)]. One study found that unvaccinated participants were less likely to agree with the statement that COVID-19 infection is more severe during pregnancy versus their vaccinated counterparts (47% vs. 78%) [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01248)]. These studies suggest that some individuals may be complacent or misinformed about how COVID-19 infection presents differently and more dangerously during pregnancy [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01248), [36](#B36-vaccines-11-01248)]. There are many factors at play that may be contributing to the lack of understanding or belief around the severity of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Two core contributors appear to be a lack of evidence-based communication and disparity in education. A large amount of anecdotal information can be found on social media and TV ads, and individuals who rely on social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook for health-related information are less likely to receive the influenza vaccine. Furthermore, social media platforms appear to disseminate information regarding vaccine hesitance more successfully than vaccine uptake [ [74](#B74-vaccines-11-01248)], whereas exposure to direct conversations between healthcare providers and patients has been shown to reduce vaccine hesitancy overall [ [74](#B74-vaccines-11-01248)]. A wider lens of educational disparities across regions can be used to understand the lack of understanding around the severity of COVID-19 disease for pregnant people. Rates of vaccination in 2021 were found to be lower in rural counties than in urban counties, in part explained by lower education rates [ [75](#B75-vaccines-11-01248)]. Rural residents have less access to specialty doctors or scientific literature, and their health literacy is generally more limited in these communities [ [76](#B76-vaccines-11-01248)]. 4.6. Balancing Risks and Benefits for Oneself and Fetus [36](#B36-vaccines-11-01248), [68](#B68-vaccines-11-01248), [69](#B69-vaccines-11-01248)]. However, in one study conducted outside of the United States, perceived benefits about the COVID-19 vaccine contributed positively to vaccine acceptance and vaccination rates [ [77](#B77-vaccines-11-01248)]. \"Positive perceptions\" included evaluations of trust and mistrust in the benefits of the vaccine, beliefs regarding the vaccine causing infertility, and future risks of the vaccine, among others. Studies have, in turn, hypothesized that the type of information that may contribute to an individual's understanding of the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine and/or the potential risks of the COVID-19 disease, such as level of education and access to healthcare, may influence a pregnant individual's acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine [ [77](#B77-vaccines-11-01248), [78](#B78-vaccines-11-01248)]. For many women, this means weighing the perceived risks associated with the vaccine with the risks associated with acquiring COVID-19 [ [52](#B52-vaccines-11-01248)]. 4.7. Limitations of Models of Vaccine Acceptance in Pregnancy and Research Gaps [79](#B79-vaccines-11-01248)]. Specifically, more attention and resources toward increasing vaccine uptake should be directed to women living in low-income households and/or working women. Further, culturally competent approaches should be prioritized among African American populations who face higher rates of maternal mortality. Research on vaccine hesitancy should be conducted broadly among minority and non-English speaking groups, who have been historically harmed or marginalized by medicine and science. Research should also be conducted to learn about the reaction of pregnant individuals to social media ads and other public health materials to determine the best method of addressing pregnant women's unique sources of vaccine hesitancy. 5. Conclusions [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01248), [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01248), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01248)], features of decision-making in pregnancy [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-01248)], clinical practice, and our research from the One Vax Two Lives social media campaign [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-01248), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-01248)] to incorporate factors unique to pregnancy that may be helpful in designing research studies or public health communication campaigns. The 5-P model is an important beginning for further research into the factors that lead to vaccine hesitancy or acceptance in pregnancy.
