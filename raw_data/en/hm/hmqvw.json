Chief of Staff Action List 1 ZSFG CHIEF OF STAFF REPORT Presented to the JCC -ZSFG on May 23, 2023 May 2023 MEC Meeting CLINICAL SERVICE REPORT: Community Primary Care (CPC ) Service - Joseph Pace, MD, Chief The CPC's vision incorporates the True North Values which have not only guided the Service through the challenges but also re-oriented the Service in addressing deferred patient care. The highlights of the reports are as follows: 1. Scope of the Clinical Service a. Structure of the Department DPH Organization - CPC is made up of Primary Care and Whole Person Integrated Care (WPIC) which fall under SFHN Ambulatory Care. Primary Care Organization - As CMO for Primary Care , Dr. Joseph Pace, oversees community- based and ZSFG campus Primary Care. As Chief of Service, Dr. Pace supervises CPC medical directors , and manages credentialing of both their staff and WPIC providers. b. Clinical Services/Programs - The Primary Care clinics serve patients across S F by providing various scopes of care. There is close partnership with Primary Care partners and Specialty Care colleagues at ZSFG. Moreover, some remodels (Maxine Hall and Castro Mission Health Centers) and new buildings (Southeast Family Health Center and WPIC's Maria X Martinez Health Resource Center) were completed. There are 10 clinics/programs across SF which provide full spectrum primary care for children, adolescents, pregnant women, and adults. Special population focus is provided to the following: (1) Adolescents/ transitional age youth at CHPY (Community Health Programs for Youth) , (2) Elders 55 and over at Curry Clinic , (3) Gender health at CMH C (Castro Mission HC) & TWUHC (Tom Waddell Urban HC) , (4) People experiencing homelessness/ unstable housing at TWUHC , and (5) People living with HIV at Behavioral Health and Substance Use Services include the following: (1) Primary Care Behavioral Health teams - mostly comprised of licensed clinical social workers ; (2) Primary Care Psychiatry -mostly on a consultative model ; (3) Behavioral Health Homes - primary care brought to specialty mental health clinics across the city (4) Office -Based Opioid Treatment - buprenorphine treatment , and PHHC (Potrero HC) and TWUHC . Ancillary Services - These include Clinical Pharmacy, Complex Care Management, Dental (clinic and school - based), Integrative ( acupuncture and mind- body modalities ), Nutrition, Pharmacy, and Podiatry . Centralized Call Center - The center operates 7 days/week annually for patients . The Nurse Advice Line is open 5 - 7 days per week, and Telephone Appointment Providers provide urgent care. Whole Person Integrated Care (WPIC) - The service has an increasin g number of programs : Maria X Martinez Health Resource Center, Medical Respite and Sobering Center, nursing services in Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH), Shelter Health, and Street Medicine. 2. Providers and Patients a. Credentialed Providers - The Service h as a large group of providers that include 61 physicians, 40 NPs/PAs, 9 clinical pharmacists, 9 dentists, 9 ObGyn, 9 psychiatric providers, 5 acupuncturists, 4 podiatrists, and 3 neurologists. b. Patients - Almost 100K patients are active and enrolled but not yet engaged in care. About 58k patients are active with 271K registered encounters in FY 2021 -2022. The 4 ZSFG -based PC clinics (Family Health Center, Children's Health Center, Positive Health Program, and RFPC) take care of half of the patient population while the other half is cared for in the community PC clinics. The breakdown in terms of race/ethnicity served is as follows: 42% Latinx, 25% Asian, and 13% Black. For gender identity, the patients are fairly evenly split for patients who identify as ma le or female with non -binary < 0.5%. 3. Financial Report (FY 2021- 2022) - The top 3 sources of $120.78M revenue were Medi -Cal (34%), Quality Incentive payments (24%), and General Fund (21%). The expenditures amounted to $120.78M as well with salaries/fringe expenses (86%) and operating expenses (14%). 2 4. Performance Improvement and Patient Safety Initiatives a. Success: Recovery in Chronic Disease Management and Preventative Care - From 2020- 2022, the Service regained ground in chronic disease management and preventative care metrics : there was an upward trend for all metrics due to extensive efforts from Population Health Team in standardizing work by MEAs and in providing staff with frequent data updates to track progress. b. Priorities Population Health - The goal is to build on the gains in chronic disease management and preventative care seen over the last 2 years by building out robust central outreach team ; hiring QI analysts to support all health centers ; and expanding the role of nurses in chronic disease management, starting with Hypertension Management SP and more. Also, an important priority is to address the city's increasing overdose deaths : the Service is overhauling its approach to controlled medication prescribin g/stewardship and expanding capacity for Opioid Overdose Prevention and Medications for Opioid Use Disorder . Patient Access - The California Department of Managed Care's benchmarks for timely access are 10 business days for a non -urgent appointment and 2 days for an urgent appointment. As of April 2023, the Service still struggles with timely access to care in spite of g ains in healthcare maintenance. A n A3 process identified c ountermeasures that will hopefully turn around patient access . Staff Recovery and Resiliency - Changing the empanelment and appointment template structure as a countermeasure to improve timely access will not be effective if the vacancies are not filled and if workforce is not retain ed. While the active patient panel has remained steady, there has been a rising number of new enrollees; there is insufficient number of providers to serve the patients. A recent staff experience survey revealed that 21% of clinicians will likely or definitely reduce hours in the next 2 years, and 38% of all staff will likely or definitely leave in the same per iod. An article from JGIM last year revealed the nationwide trend that t he Service and other healthcare systems are experiencing: hiring and retaining PCPs is a challenge for everyone due to significantly increased workload and other factors. L ooking at workload is important, but the workforce has to be valued and places where people feel underappreciated (or worse) need to be identified and uprooted. These led to an A3 aimed to reduce the number of teams who intend to leave or reduce hours by improving organizational culture, communication, development opportunities and resources (filling vacancies, EHR optimization). O ngoing initiatives by multidisciplinary groups to streamline communication are as follows: (1) reimagining PC communication workflows and (2) collaborating with Ambulatory Care Committee on EPIC optimization. Equity - The goal is to deepen the Service's focus on anti -racism and equity action plan by uprooting the norms of the organization that reinforce white supremacy culture. T he Service's clinicians and staff relayed the need for a workplace where race and racism can be comfortably discussed, along with the need to improv e racial equity. The efforts start with leadership and then spread to other staff members. o Three CPC Leadership team members joined the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) in January 2023 for a year -long collaborative to understand how the organization's culture impacts the ability to make strides in improving equity. o There have been con versations among Service's leaders on how white supremacy shows up at work. o There is ongoing r ecruitment for a more diverse workforce at clinical and leadership levels by weighing lived experience in search process, contracting external recruiters, and par tnering with pipeline programs (looking to Community College and CSU to build workforce). Financial Sustainability - A priority is to improve financial sustainability by developing productivity and revenue dashboards. c. Hospital and Medical Staff Committees - A list of the involvements in various committees by the staff was presented. In addition, many clinical sites have free teaching activities for pre- graduate/certificate and postgraduate students. 5. Summary - CPC's pri orities are as follows : Patient Access - Appointments (New and Return) : Access A3 countermeasures focus on consistent opening and closure or panels, standardized scheduling templates, productivity expectations, finding solutions to part -time providers Population Health - Continued work led by the Service QI/Population Health Team, Building robust central outreach team, Funded analysts and practice managers at all primary care clinics Sustained Focus on Anti -Racism and Equity Action - Hope to align with rest of SFHN, DPH, UCSF; Working on centralized training plan for managers and staff Recovery and Resiliency - Reduction in number of team members who intend to leave or reduce hours, A3 to focus on manager support and standardization of workflows across s ites 3 Financial Sustainability - Productivity and revenue dashboards in development Dr. Winston, along with other MEC members, expressed admiration and appreciation for Dr. Pace's leadership and the Service's incredible efforts on CPC metrics, equity /anti-racism, and other important issues .
