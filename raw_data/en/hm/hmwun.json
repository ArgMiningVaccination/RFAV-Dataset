Inaddition, inquiry wasmade into areas which have not received widespread public attention incivil rights discussions, such asprograms ofassistance ofinsurance and however, were those activities which have been intheeyeofthecivil rights storm, such asfederally assisted loan andgrant programs, covered byTitle VIofthe1964 Civil Rights Act. Nonetheless, this study isnotanexhaustive one. Limits necessarily have been placed upon it,interms ofthelaws, agencies, andprograms covered. Forexample, inprevious Commission reports, isnot covered. Further, inthesections dealing with various Federal programs, itwaspossible totreat only arepresentative sample. Moreover, there oftheincluded toinvestigate firsthand thefield civil rights operation, thestudy hasinvolved work almost exclusively inWashington, D.C. However, information onfield activities, aswell XX ascentral office operations, wasobtained through examination of central offices files, interviews with agency personnel, andagency responses toquestionnaires. TheCommission received excellent cooperation throughout arediscussed indetail andrequested their comments and suggestions. Their responses invariably were helpful, serving to correct factual inaccuracies, clarify points which maynothave been sufficiently clear, andprovide updated information onactivities undertaken subsequent tothetime ofCommission staff investigations. These comments have been incorporated inthereport. Insome instances, agencies expressed disagreement with Commission interpretations of fact orwith theviews oftheCommission onthedesirability of particular enforcement point oftheCommission. comments, agencies sometimes staff during does notdeal primarily with the substantive impact ofcivil rights laws. TheCommission hasnot attempted here tomeasure precise gains made byminority group members asaresult ofcivil rights actions oftheFederal Government. This Rather, wehave attempted todetermine and agencies, buttoanalyze onacomparative basis theeffectivenass oftheoverall enforcement effort. Through acomparative study, the Commission believes allagencies canprofit from theexperience of others, particularly those whose activities clearly call for improvement. Finally, while thereport deals primarily with thecurrent civil rights posture oftheFederal Government, itshould beunderstood that didnotoriginate inthecurrent Administration, norwasthere any substantial period civil rights enforcement uniformly wasatahigh level ofeffectiveness. Rather, theinadequacies are systemic totheFederal bureaucracy anditisonly systemic changes that thegreat promise ofcivil rights lawswill berealized. CHAPTER 1 THEFEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS ARSENAL I.Introduction Over thepast three decades, theFederal Government has demonstrated agrowing concern fortherights ofminorities, after nearly three quarters ofacentury ofgovernmental indifference. Thecourts have ledtheway, providing substantive civil rights meaning tothebroad constitutional mandates oftheequal protection clause oftheFourteenth Amendment andthedueprocess clause ofthe Fifth Branch followed, orders toact. Since 1957, Congress hasenacted five civil rights laws, including theland- mark theVoting Rights Actof1965, and These have been taken inresponse toin- creasing protest byminority group members against thesecond-class citizenship towhich theyhave been relegated busboycott white rights denials. Violent suppression ofFederal civil rights laws. Inrecent years, Mexican Americans, American Indians, andother minority groups also have protested thedenial oftheir rightful heritage offull equality. Their protests, too, have begun tostrike aresponsive chord intheFederal Government. Thevarious laws, executive orders, andjudicial decisions constitute aformidable array ofcivil rights guarantees. They provide broad protections against discrimination invirtually every aspect oflife--in education, employment, housing, totake the initiative rights. Inshort, exists apowerful Federal arsenal of weapons available tocopewith racial andethnic discrimination. Set forth inthefollowing sections isabrief discussion ofthebreadth of protection afforded andthescope law. with Federal employment. OnAugust 8,1969, President Nixon issued themost recent Executive Order dealing with this subject,\u2014superseding andstrengthening previous presidential orders. TheOrder reaffirms governmental policy both toassure equal opportunity inFederal employment toallpersons regardless of race, color, religion, sex, ornational origin and\"topromote the fullrealization ofequal employment opportunity ulng department isrequired totake necessary steps toassure theOrder's goals each agency isrequired sufficient andreport thatdiscrimination byState and local governments \u2014including jobdiscrimination--violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Butasapractical matter, protection against discrimination pertain Congress have acted toprovide anadministrative remedy because theFederal andState governments participate thegovernment service. Forexample, anadministrative remedy isprovided bytheFederal Merit Standards, which apply toa variety offederally funded programs andcover some 250,000 State employees. Originally promulgated under a1939amendment totheSocial Security Actof1935, theMerit Standards require that State employees administering these programs beselected, promoted, and compensated according toafederally approved. State-administered merit system. Among thespecific criteria established inthe1939 standards wasaprohibition against discrimination onthebasis of andpolitical theprohibition was extended Standards Provision are: AidtoFamilies with Dependent Children, OldAgeAssistance, other federally aided public assistance programs, andcertain State health programs financed bytheDepartment ofHealth, Education, andWelfare; State services andunemployment insurance bytheDepartment ofLabor; andcivil defense activities supported bytheDepartment ofDefense. authorized togrant financial assistance hasthefinal responsibility forassuring theimplementation of approved supeirvision oftheimplementation ofall clause, rests Merit Systems intheDepartment of Education, against State employment discrimina- tion provided Standards, such discrimination also isprohibited requirements oftheDepartment of Housing andUrban Development intwoimportant programs itadministers- Urban Renewal andPublic Housing. Under these requirements, some 900local urban renewal agencies and2,000 local public housing authorities, prohibits discriminatidn inprograms andactivities receiving Federal financial assistance, also forbids employment discrimination by States orlocalities inprograms andactivities such asappren- istoprovide employment. Under Title VI,discriminatory employment practices alsomaybe prohibited where theywould tend toresult indiscriminatory or unequal treatment forintended beneficiaries oftheprogram or activity, such asteachers inafederally aided school system, doctors ornurses inafederally aided hospital, workers. Contractors over torequire discrimination inemployment byGovernment contractors. Executive Order 11246, issued in1965, prohibits employment discrimination by government contractors orfederally assisted construction contractors, andrequires them totakeaffirmative action toremedy theeffects of past discrimination. Inaddition, banks which aredepositories of Federal funds orwhich handle Federal savings bonds aresubject ofequal employment opportunity byFederal contractors. Primary responsibility for securing compliance inspecific industries, however, rests with 15Federal agencies, called \"predominant interest agencies.\" Sanctions available under theOrder cancellation debarment employees, unions with 25ormore members orwhich operate ahiring hall, andemployment agencies which regularly obtain employees for anemployer covered bytheTitle.

Almost allhousing, federally assisted or not,must bemade available without discrimination. 1.Federally Assisted Housing a.Executive Order 11063, issued inNovember 1962, ofallfederally assisted after the Order's issuance, including housing owned bythegovernment, housing purchased inwhole orinpartwith government loans (such aslow- rent public housing), housing provided through loans Insured or guaranteed bythegovernment (such asFHAandVAhousing) andhousing provided through slum clearance orurban renewal programs. The prohibition also extends tolending practices insofar asthose practices relate toloans insured orguaranteed bytheFederal Government. Finally, covers all federally assisted housing except where theassistance provided is solely intheform ofcontracts ofinsurance orguaranty. (Although arecovered Order 11063.) Title VIdoes apply tosuchvaried housing programs asurban renewal, housing rehabilitation, relocation grants, low-rent public housing, andcode enforcement programs. Remedies under Title VIinclude suspension ortermination but most private housing aswell. Theonly significant exceptions from coverage arerental housing with fewer than five units oneofwhich 13 isowner occupied, andsingle -family houses owned byaprivate so strong.

Inaddition tothe23departments andagencies Involved In enforcing Title VI,theJustice Department andHEWhave roles of special Importance. Under Executive Order 11247 (1965) Justice is responsible forcoordinating enforcement efforts ofallFederal agencies administering programs covered bytheTitle.

Inmany Federal programs andactivities, however, therelationship between the Federal Government andtheultimate beneficiary isadirect one. Programs such asthose concerned with retirement anddisability payments, hospital andsupplemental medical insurance payments, veterans insurance andbenefit payments, andunemployment benefit payments, areamong those involving such adirect relationship. Inaddition, theFederal Government operates anumber ofdirect loan programs, business loans, which also rundirectly tobeneficiaries. There aremore than 100programs of direct Federal assistance annual expenditures ofmore 16/ than $75billion.\u2014 16/See Office ofEcononomic Opportunity, Assistance (1970) andTheBudget oftheUnited States Government, 1971: Special Analyses (1970). 17 areoutside thescope ofTitle VI.

Impact ofCivil Rights Laws andPolicies These civil rights laws andpolicies provide theFederal Government with significant authority toassure equal opportunity insuch fields asemployment, housing, allnecessary laws have Insome areas already covered, there areserious gaps incoverage. Forexample, effective Federal requirements forequal opportunity inState andlocal government employment arelargely limited to Federal Merit Standards andHUDcontractual requirements, which affect less than five percent ofallState andlocal government employees. Title VIIoftheCivil Rights Actof1964 exempts State andlocal governments from coverage. Anamendment to Title VIItoinclude employment byState andlocal governments could provide protection toallofthe 71/2million State and local government employees. Moreover, coverage ofTitle VIIcurrently islimited to _30/ eliminating school segregation inSouthern States where itresulted from legal compulsion.

Inaddition, enforcement mechanisms provided under some civil rights laws areweak. Under these laws, while minority people areassured oftheir legal right toequal opportunity, the means ofsecuring tolitigation only ifthose efforts should fail. Inboth areas. Federal thelaws already on thebooks represent animpressive been inforce forfive years ormore andthey have brought about salutary persists evenwhere itisprohibited bytheFederal Government can beofvalue even when they donotcontain strong enforcement mechanisms. Thefact that government speaks outinfavor of principles ofequal opportunity frequently brings about substantial changes inattitudes andbehavior. Insome cases, themere enactment immediate endtodiscrimination. Inother thelaws, byeffective have endtodiscriminatory practices. 1.Public Accommodations Oneofthebest examples lawcanhave whotraveled frequently between NewYork City andWashington, D.C., were denied service inrestaurants along acomplete endtodiscrimination, thousands ofhotels, Forexample, some change before Title IIwasenacted.

Many hospitals which discontinued long-standing discriminatory practices have not been reviewed since 1966. There have been reports that some hospitals andother medical facilities have reinstated some wasthelast year forwhich official figures were Itwasgenerally anticipated thatdesegregation would approximately 34 B.Persistence ofDiscrimination Despite theprogress made possible byrecently adopted civil rights laws andpolicies, there still issubstantial evidence that discrimination persists inmany areas. Generally, civil rights laws have been most successful indealing with practices that donotrequire complex institutional change.

Infields change isrequired and theFederal Government hasnotintervened economic mainstream hasproved tobea 35 complex process. Asthefollowing examples suggest, equal employment still isfarfrom afact ofAmerican life. a.Federal Employment Inthearea ofFederal employment, where thedegree of Federal control isabsolute, minority group representation has increased substantially, butNegro andSpanish surnamed Americans still aregrossly underrepresented inthehigher salary brackets. According toasurvey bytheU.S. Civil Service Commission of minority group employment intheFederal Government asof1969, less than 2percent ofGS-13 andabove Aviation anagency oftheDepartment Transportation, more than 20,000 airtraffic controllers asofJune 30,1969, only 547ofwhom were minority employees. Moreover, there were only 13minority group employees among the 1,600 supervisory andadministrative personnel atgrade GS-14 or above. b.State Employment Under Federal Merit Standards Despite nondiscrimination requirements intheMerit System, applicable tofederally aided State programs, minority group employment often remains low. Forexample, theMississippi 40/U.S. Civil Service Commission Press Release, May 14,1970. 41/U.S. Department ofTransportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Office ofCivil Rights, Minority Group andWomen Employment Reports, asofJune 1969 Report No. 5(1969). 36 Welfare hadonly 38Negroes onitsstaff ofmore only 5.3percent ofthe employees oftheLouisiana Agencies oftheemployees oftheState Emplojmient Department filed theState.

Their expectations ofequal status have been reasonable, butinmany cases these expectations have been frustrated. Itisclear that thefull potential ofcivil rights laws and policies protection of lawforallcitizens hasnotbeen raises serious questions about thewayFederal departments andagencies charged with civil rights responsibilities have carried them out. Have these agencies established adequate goals andpriorities? Arethemechanisms and procedures adopted tosecure compliance adequate tothetask?

Through Presidential executive orders andcongressional legislation, theFederal Government hasestablished this Presidential executive orders applying toevery department andagency andrequires that necessary steps be taken toachieve equal emplojmient opportunity.

Penalties fornoncompliance include con- tract cancellation anddebarment from future Federal contracts. While primary responsibility forsecuring compliance inspecific industries isdivided among anumber ofFederal departments and agencies, overall responsibility hasbeen placed intheOffice of Federal Contract Compliance within theDepartment ofLabor, also toprevent private employment Rights with 25ormore employees aswell asbylabor unions andemployment agencies.

Despite these provisions against employment discrimination, the problem ofunequal opportunity remains severe. Minority emplojnnent intheFederal establishment remains disproportionately lowand minority employees rarely arefound inhigh grade positions or supervisory positions. Despite strong Federal contract requirements, therecord ofgovernment contractors, heavily reliant onFederal contracts that ofemployers notsubject tothese requirements. Andwhile there have been some overall minority emplojnnent gains inthegeneral private labor market, discrimination continues largely unabated sixyears after Congress ordained equal employment opportunity asorganic law. 1/There areseveral other laws affecting public andprivate em- plojnnent discrimination. Forexample. Federal merit standards and HUDcontractual requirements prohibit emplojnnent discrimination by States which participate inanumber programs. VIoftheCivil Rights Actof1964 prohibits emplojnnent discrimination infederally assisted programs fact isthat laws arenotworking very well. Insome cases ,enforcement procedures andmechanisms have inherent weaknesses which limit thelaws' effectiveness. Inmost cases, however, theenforcement agencies have notused their procedures andmechanisms with theboldness andimagination necessary for maximum effect. Andinthearea there has been afailure ofcoordination which hasdiluted theFederal enforcement effort. II. FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT -TheRole ofTheCivil Service Commission A.Introduction With nearly 3,000,000 civilian workers (almost four percent ofthetotal work force), theFederal Government istheNation's largest employer. There arethousands ofdifferent jobcategories within theFederal civil service, ranging fromunskilled labor tothose involving highly complex technical andscientific skills andad- ministrative positions ofbroad scope andresponsibility.

Infact, theGovernment today compares favorably private bysuch commonly accepted indicia aswage andsalary levels, jobsecurity, insurance protection, vacation andsick leave benefits, retirement plans, grievance andappeal procedures, andother mechanisms de- signed toassure equitable treatment forallwhoareemployed or seek employment. Butinterms ofequal emplojrment opportunity the relative position oftheFederal Government isless clear. A tradition ofdiscrimination intheFederal service accounts part forboth theactual shortcomings which characterize theFederal passage oftheCivil Service Actof1883, discrimination against nonwhite employees--often total minority exclusion--was accepted practice among Federal intheCensus Bureau, which wasstarted during William Howard Taft's administration, continued into the 1920's.

This policy hasbeen affirmed andreinforced through executive with theFederal Government, Fully athird oftheNation's labor force isemployed by companies which areGovernment contractors. Moreover, these companies generally areamong theNation's largest andmost prestigious business enterprises. They typically areleaders inthebusiness community andthepolicies they adopt frequently areprecedents which other business enterprises follow. Elaborate mechanisms have been established over theyears to assure effective administration andenforcement oftheGovernment's equal en^loyment opportunity policy. Resources ofthevarious Federal departments andagencies which contract with private businesses are available tomonitor compliance. Particular agencies have been assigned responsibility forcompliance inspecific industries. And mechanisms have been established forcoordinating andoverseeing the entire Federal compliance effort. Further, strong sanctions, such astermination ofGovernment contracts anddebarment from future contracts areavailable toassure full compliance with equal opportunity requirements. 134 Despite theincreasingly strong Presidential commitment tothe goal ofequal employment opportunity, ofthe sanctions available it,anddespite thepotential effectiveness oftheFederal monitoring equal opportunity employment, when measured interms ofactual employment ofminorities, Presidential commitment hasnotbeen ofGovernment contractors; sanctions rarely have been used; andthe Federal monitoring mechanisms have notproved effective.

Yet itisestimated that thepopulation ofthecity ofSt.Louis, which located within tenmiles Douglas installation, is 164/ 43.7 percent black. Some ofthediscriminatory acts denying minority citizens equal employment opportunity arepersonal andovert, butthemost significant andomnipresent type isinstitutional orsystemic--discriminatory practices that operate automatically toimpede minority access to employment opportunity. Forexample, where anemployer orunion forrecruitment persons ofemployment information, such asthrough present employees orofficials, arenecessarily denied equal access to available opportunities. Recruitment carried outthrough schools orcolleges with apredominantly nonminority makeup also inevitably excludes minority group applicants. 164/Id.

Inaddition, where minority employees have been assigned to\"traditional\" jobs ordepartments, which donotafford equal access toopportunities fortraining oradvancement within the organization, this, too, represents acontinuing barrier toequal job opportunity. Barriers toequal employment opportunity such asthese will persist until positive action istaken tocorrect them. Therefore, inemployment inmost aregenuinely nond iscrimina tory. B.

Summary Equal employment opportunity isanunquestioned right ofevery American, protected byactions ofallthree branches oftheFederal Government. Executive orders require nondiscrimination in employment bytheFederal Government, itself^andbythose who contract with theFederal Government. Judicial decisions have interpreted post-Civil Warcivil rights Labor AndCongress, through VIIoftheCivil Rights Actof1964, has established equal employment opportunity inprivate employment as organic law. Although thelegal right toequal employment opportunity is broadly protected, oneofthemajor itinfact-- through enforcement--frequently islacking. Further, themechansims established byFederal agencies charged with responsibility for administering andenforcing fair employment laws have notbeenadequately utilized. Federal Employment TheFederal Government isthelargest employer intheNation. asthestandard bearer intheemployment field fortheentire country. Intherealm of equal employment opportunity, theGovernment has, inthepast, been seriously remiss. Inrecent years, however, avariety ofactions have 411 been initiated toimprove employment andpromotional opportunities forminority groups andeliminate discrimination within theFederal service. Less than 50years ago, Federal Government policy sanctioned racial segregation andexclusion initsownemployment. Less than a generation ago, thatpolicy changed andsome ofthemore overt manifestations ofracial andethnic prejudice were abolished, although many discriminatory practices persisted. Onlywithin thepast decade have significant efforts beenmade toopen opportunities in service onanequal basis toall. Executive inequities. Taking cognizance ofthepersisting problems, President Nixon, issued Executive Order andCSC's operation Mexican Americans, andmembers of other minority groups have been intensified. Theexamination process hasbeen brought under close scrutiny toeliminate cultural bias anddevelop examinations designed torecruit, train, and employ thousands ofdisadvantaged youth have been initiated inrecent years. Efforts toeliminate discrimination inpromotion practices were furthered byarevised Federal merit promotion policy inAugust 1968. Closely hasbeen their abilities andheighten their awareness ofequal opportunity attention to theequal employment opportunity aspects ofagency programs under periodic review byCSC's Bureau ofInspections. Acomprehensive set ofguidelines, developed plans ofaction, wasissued inDecember 1969, emphasizing results andsuggesting various affirmative actions. They stop short, however, ofrequiring specific numerical orpercentage goals for minority employment. Revisions inprocedures forprocessing complaints ofdiscrimination inFederal employment went intoeffect inJuly 1969. Utilizing agency \"counselors,\" they encourage informal resolution ofgrievances wherever possible. Although indications allegations ofdiscrimination have been substantiated, have generally been inadequate. Efforts toidentify sources ofproblems oreven tomeasure the equal employment opportunity status agencies atanygiven point intime have been handicapped bylack ofadequate Addressing itself tosome shortcomings inthis area, CSChasauthorized agencies toinstitute automated data procedures designed, among other 414 things, toprovide current information onavariety ofFederal employment practices. Thenewprocedures were installed number ofFederal inconjunction with theNovember 1969 census ofminority and1969Executive Orders. Bysuchmeans as anInteragency Advisory Group, Federal Personnel Manual letters, meetings andseminars with Federal officials,private groups and individuals, CSChassought todisseminate itsownpolicies widely, andfacilitate communication with Federal agencies andwith private groups interested inimproving equal employment opportunity inthe Federal Government. Measures which have been undertaken byCSCinrecent years have gone fartoward attaining equal opportunity within theconcept ofa merit system ofFederal employment. However, inthecontext ofa society which hassystematically discriminated against millions of itscitizens andhasproduced alarge class ofdisadvantaged Americans, even anoptimally functioning merit system will inevitably reflect these inequities. Therefore, itisdoubtful whether continued efforts to eliminate inequity within theconfines ofthemerit system canentirely succeed. Ultimately, andatevery level ofFederal employment. 415 Contract Compliance isa29-year history ofineffective efforts torequire Federal contractors provided which ischarged with responsibility forcoordinating andimplement policies andprocedures thatwould produce vigorous compliance programs inthe Federal agencies immediately responsible forcontract compliance. Recent actions taken ineffectuating OFCC's three current priorities -- defining theaffirmative action requirement oftheOrder, monitoring compliance programs oftheagencies, andstructuring aGovernment-wide construction compliance prcgram--give promise ofleading this year, took thesignificant step of expanding itsregulations todeal specifically with thenature of theaffirmative action requirement. Theextent towhich these expanded regulations will beimplemented bycompliance agencies depends upon OFCC capabilities didnotoffer wasunable 416 enforcement ofsimilar affirmative action requirements inthepast. Monitoring ofagency Executive Order enforcement isakey ingredient inaneffective Federal contract compliance program. Establishment ofuniform policies andtheassurance that policies tohave improved OFCC's monitoring capability, butnoprocedures formonitoring have been developed. Thevalue of these structural changes istotally dependent upon actions yettobe taken. After several false starts, OFCC hasfinally established the firm basis foraGovernment -wide construction and hasadopted astrategy foritsapplication. ThePhiladelphia Plan approach ofrequiring minority group percentage employment goals for specific construction trades provides thebasic standard ofconstruction compliance. OFCC hasindicated that itisprepared toimpose Philadelphia- cities those cities devise plans oftheir owntoincrease minority utilization intheconstruction trades. These community-developed have inonly viability established, norhasprovision disappointing. Forexample, intworecent contract compliance matters involving southern textile mills andalarge aircraft manufacturer inSt.Louis, DODinitially failed tofollow itsownprocedures. Though some changes have beenmade recurrence ofthese failures, the compliance defects. itsstaff istoosmall adequate. The14other responsible forcontract compliance insome important industries, have failed toassign sufficiently high priority tothisresponsibility. These agencies have limped along with inadequate staffs andcumbersome organizations which have produced avariety ofinadequate noranycompany debarred for Executive Order violation. Rarely have anyhearings been held concerning noncompliance. The collection ofdatawould permit compliance agencies andOFCC toadequately evaluate their efforts andthetotal effect oftheentire 418 orindeed, whether anyprogress isbeing made. Though future plans contemplate extensive data collection and analysis these efforts areonly intheir initial stages. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Attheclose offiscal year 1970, theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which hasresponsibility foradministering Title VIIoftheCivil Rights Actof1964, will have been inoperation for five years. Itisnotmuch closer tothegoal oftheelimination of employment discrimination than itwasatitsinception. Many factors account forEEOC's inability tosubstantially reduce employment discrimination. Foremost among them have been lack of enforcement power andgrossly inadequate staff andbudget resources. Unless Congress rectifies these have resulted inanabsence of continuity anddirection atalllevels ofCommission operation. Particularly damaging have been theinordinately rapid Chairmen, Commissioners, andkeysupervisory personnel; longvacancies inmajor posts; anexceedingly high rate personnel; inadequate training programs, especially forinvestigative andconciliation staff; insufficient coordination thevarious central andfailure toestablish clear lines ofdirection for supervision ofthefield andforliaison with other Federal agencies. TheCommission's operations have also been hampered byhaphazard programming, which isfrequently onanadhocbasis.

Fourth, hearings hasbeen greatly byfailure toconduct anenforcement thepredominant interest hasbeen limited. TheEmployment Section Rights out byitssmall size. 421 Its32authorized attorney positions a significant effect upondiscriminatory employment practices. Even iftheEmployment Section were doubled, however, thewidespread reform needed intheemployment area cannot realistically effort discrimination. TheDivision hasfailed todevote sufficient staff resources tothis matter. TheDivision concedes that it canlitigate only ahandful ofthepotential employment cases tomethods ofderiving themost effective acoordinated Government attention todefining itsrole asanelement oftheentire Federal equal employ- ment opportunity than focusing solely oninternal 422 procedures andresources, theDivision thedifferent cansupplement each activities. Inspite ofoverlapping legal jurisdiction, EEOC, OFCC the 15contract compliance agencies), andtheDepartment ofJustice have notyetbegun toeffectively coordinate their efforts. Each has independently developed itsowngoals, policies andprocedures. Until recently, nosystematic attempts were made toshare data or complaint investigation andcompliance review findings. Joint reviews orconciliations rarely have been conducted, andwhen attempted, they have notbeen successful examples ofcoordinated action. Employers occasionally have been reviewed bytwoorthree different Federal agencies andinconsistent demands made upon them. Theentire Federal effort toendemployment discrimination in theprivate sector hassuffered asaresult. This failure of rights agencies isgrossly understaffed. InJuly anInteragency Staff Coordinating Committee was formed todevelop mechanisms tocopewith these problems. Theresults 423 oftheCommittee's weekly deliberations have thus farbeen disappointing.

More significant Federal involvement inhousing came through the1934National Housing Act, which created theFederal Housing Administration (FHA) anditsmortgage programs. The Actalso established ofinsurance Government's early housing theNation's credit machinery bystimulating greater activity inthehome finance community.

Itwasanopportunity that waslost. Early Federal policy inthehousing field accepted andevenmagnified the attitudes ofprivate industry. FHA, forexample, notonly acquiesced industry practices, them, even ofrecommending amodel racially restrictive what theagency racial groups.\" TheFederal Home Loan Bank Board andtheHome Owners' Loan Corporation openly espoused policies favoring racial residential exclusion. Inpublic housing theFederal Government adopted adifferent either all-Negro orall-white. Until 1962, thiswasregarded asamatter strictly within the 427 discretion oflocal public housing authorities. This wasthecase despite thefact that numerous Federal court decisions hadmade it clear that such segregation wasinviolation oftheUnited States Constitution. Even innewer programs, such asurban renewal, thepurpose ofrevitalizing theNation's cities, discriminatory housing byprivate redevelopers benefiting from government subsidies were notdeemed amatter in which government should interfere. Bytheearly 1960 's,Federal hadprogressed tothepoint where open occupancy twopercent ofthenewhomes provided inthepost-war years through FHAmortgage insurance B.Executive onEqual Government....\" Thus housing provided through mortgage insurance bytheFederal Housing Administration (FHA) orloan guarantees bytheVeterans Administration theprincipal oftheOrder, assetforth in Section 101, related almost entirely tohousing provided through Federal aidagreements executed after theOrder's effective date of November 20,1962.

Traditionally tension has existed inmost Federal departments andagencies between those with program responsibilities andthose with civil rights responsibilities. This also hasbeen true atHUD, HUDprogram personnel have been interested primarily inthe ofhousing andhave tended toview civil rights con- siderations asanunwanted obstacle, rather than asaninherent and significant part oftheir responsibilities. Forexample, Federal public housing officials permitted local housing authorities toassign tenants onaracially segregated basis formany years after tocivil rights issues.

Adequate staff training isessential forthis purpose. Program personnel, forwhom civil rights often isanewresponsibility, must develop awareness andsensitivity regarding adifferent set ofissues from theoneswith which they traditionally have dealt. Bythesame token, civil rights presonnel must develop program Other than ina fewisolated instances where theAssistant Regional Administrator initiated atraining program, field personnel dealing with civil rights complaints have nothadadequate training toperform their functions with maximum effectiveness. Moreover, program personnel whoadminister programs having far-reaching civil rights implications have hadnotraining topotential violations. This omission hashadtheeffect ofperpetuating theorientation ofprogram personnel toward housing production with civil rights responsibilities being viewed largely asanimpediment. Civil rights personnel continued tobeinsulated from theDepartment's value intheabsence of objective standards, many ofwhich areintheprocess ofbeing developed.

FHA-insured mortgages amounted tomore than $9billion during thesame year. 501 worked closely together over theyears andgenerally have adopted Identical policies tocarry outtheir equal housing opportunity responsibilities. Forexample, itwasdetermined shortly after the Executive Order wasissued that anybuilder barred because of discrimination fromparticipation intheprograms ofoneagency also would bebarred bytheother agency. Similarly, both agencies originally exempted from coverage under theExecutive Order one- and two-family owner-occupied homes. Atthesame time, beadvertised as \"open occupancy\" orthat aided builders undertake marketing practices aimed atattracting minority purchasers. Thetwoagencies, however, donotalways adopt identical oreven similar policies. Insome cases their policies have differed substantially. A. Racially Restrictive Covenants Asnoted above, shortly after theissuance ofExecutive Order 11063j FHAchanged itspolicy ofablanket refusal toinsure loans on property carrying covenants filed ofrecord after February 15,1950, were as follows; Persons intheclass prohibited were able topurchase homes inthearea; and whowassuccessful in purchasing ahome carrying aracially restrictive covenant could not obtain VAfinancing unless atleast oneother Negro already had purchased ahome other than onethat VAhadguaranteed. In1969, FHAandVAmade additional changes intheir policies concerning racially restrictive covenants. Again, thechanges adopted bythetwoagencies were different. According tocurrent FHApolicy, theagency will loans regardless ofwhether theproperty carries covenant. FHArequires, however, that thepurchaser that hewill notsubsequently refuse to sell thehome because oftherace, color, creed, ornational origin oftheprospective buyer. FHAalso requires that thebuyer expressly 180 /Letter from Fred B.Rhodes, Acting Administrator, Veterans Administration, toHoward A.Glickstein, Acting Staff Director, U.S.Commission onCivil Rights, andvoid disclaim it. togrant loans regardless ofwhether theproperty carries aracially restrictive covenant. two-family owner-occupied housing. Thus, while Federal laws clearly prohibit discrimination insuch housing, VAhasnotyetchanged its policy toconform tothese arequirement would impose anadditional condition ofeligibility upon veterans, which would be unauthorized under theagency's governing statutes.

B. Civil Rights Roles ofMortgage Lending Institutions and Their Supervisors Because nearly allhousing isacquired through mortgage credit, mortgage lending institutions necessarily play akeyrole in determining therange ofhousing choice. Their role with respect to housing opportunities forminority group members isparticularly crucial. Forexample, asthisCommission mortgage lending institutions \"are amajor factor inthedenial of 210 / equal housing opportunity.\" are avariety ofways inwhich mortgage lending institutions canprove aformidable barrier to minority group members intheir search forhousing. They maydeny mortgage loans tominority group members, either generally orfor houses innon-minority areas. Second, theymay\"red-line\" areas in which minority group families areheavily concentrated andrefuse to make loans inthese areas toallhome seekers, minority ormajority group. Third, theymayoffer loans tominority group members under more stringent terms byimposing 210 /Id., at141. 513 higher down payments, higher interest rates, lower appraisal values, andhigher credit standards. Allofthese practices areprohibited under Title VIII ofthe Civil Rights however, in that they canberationalized ongrounds ofcredit judgment. The agencies which supervise mortgage lending institutions traditionally have shied away from substituting their judgment forthat ofthe lending institutions forpurposes ofcritizing them forloans they have chosen nottomake. Rather, theagencies have confined themselves tocritizing lending institutions forloans they have made which, forcredit reasons orotherwise, should nothave been made. Although individual onallmortgage loan applications, notmerely those which have been approved, examiners would have little difficulty in uncovering patterns orpractices ofdiscrimination, andappropriate corrective action could betaken. Thus thesupervisory agencies could play akeyrole inassuring that theNation's lending community serves topromote thecause housing opportunity. Itisarole they have been reluctant toassume. 514 C.

Asinother areas ofcivil rights compliance, the collection ofracial andethnic data iscrucial. Moreover, thequestionnaire relates only tothepractices ofthe lending institutions themselves.

Strong action onboth recommendations would contribute significantly toachieving thegoal ofequal housing Reserve System hadreceived none. The Comptroller oftheCurrency office hadreceived only one. Itis doubtful, however, that these complaints reflect anaccurate measure oftheextent oftheproblem. Foronething, theagencies arelargely unknown tothose outside thefinancial communities. Therefore, itis doubtful whether people discriminated against would know towhom to complain. 521 VI.

Introduction Title VIprograms andprograms ofinsurance andguaranty both involve andtheultimate beneficiaries oftheprogram. TheFederal Govern- ment also administers programs which involve adirect relationship between Government andthebeneficiaries. These direct assistance programs typically take theform ofcash benefits, such asincome 539 / security payments, direct loans, andcash subsidies. Byfarthelargest category ofdirect assistance programs is that ofiacome security benefits andpayments. Forexample, the Social Security A^dministration (SSA) administers theoldageand survivors insurance program which will payapproximately $29.7 billion inretirement andsurvivor benefits toapproximately 540 retirees andtheir dependents in1971. SSAalso administers thedisability insurance program which will pay approximately $3.2 billion tomore than 2.5million beneficiaries 541 / in1971.

Itisestimated that loans under this 545 / program will amount tomore than $350 million in1971. The Farmers HomeAdministration (FMHA) ,inaddition toitsinsured loans programs, makes direct loans tofarmers foroperating and emergency expenses.

Theprimary example inthis category arepayments forthesupport in1971. expenditures fordirect will amount toapproximately $75billion, some three times theamount ingrant-in-aid programs many programs determine tostrict andimpartial criteria. Indeed, thisview isheld bysome Federal agencies that direct assistance programs andhasbeen offered asjustification forthe failure totake specific Retirement Board, Acts isamatter ofstatutory right, with any denial subject tojudicial Administration point: onCivil Rights, ofthebenefit. 550/ There issome question, however, whether this confidence that direct assistance programs necessarily operate ina nondiscriminatory manner iswarranted. Even though these programs involve direct relationships between Federal officials andbene- ficiaries they frequently permit adegree ofdiscretion and judgment onthepart ofFederal officials that lends itself to acts ofdiscrimination against minority group beneficiaries. Even inprograms which limit thediscretion ofFederal officials andgrant benefits asamatter benefits toveterans depend onthe degree These alower degree ofdisability canreduce theamount ofbenefits awarded tominority veterans .Bythe same token. Social Security Administration officials orVA officials maysystematically fail toadvise minority group members oftheir rights under Social Security orVAbenefit programs, thereby preventing them from enjoying thefullbenefits they areentitled to. Again, Soil Conservation Service officials mayoffer minority group farmoperators technical assistance ofa 55(y Questionnaire Response ofVeterans Administration. 789 lesser amount orquality than offered towhite farmers, leading tolower productivity oftheir land. Further, inface toface dealings with minority applicants, Federal officials maybe deliberately rude ormayotherwise treat them inaninsulting ordegrading manner. These examples arenotentirely hypothetical. There is evidence tosuggest thatminority group beneficiaries arenot participating insome direct assistance programs onanequitable basis. Forexample, theSoil Conservation Service which provides technical assistance butnofinancial assistance toland owners and farm operators, provided onequarter more services onapercapita 551 / basis towhites than toNegroes in1969.

Sumcnary TheFederal Government maintains problems oftheAmerican people--housing, education, jobtraining, economic development. These programs frequently take theform ofbenefits flowing directly from theFederal Government to theindividual beneficiary, such associal security payments. Small Business Administration business loans, andfarm support subsidies. Other Federal programs involve oneormore intermediaries, andprogram benefits reach individual beneficiaries indirectly, through the intermediaries. Some ofthese indirect assistance programs take the form ofcashdisbursements--grants loan guarantees andHEWstudent loan insurance. Allthree forms ofFederal program assistance carry prohibitions against discrimination. Indirect assistance programs, which involve only theFederal Government andtheindividual beneficiaries, the Fifth Amendment totheConstitution clearly prohibits racial orethnic discrimination byFederal officials whoadminister these programs. 804 Inindirect assistance programs that operate through Federal insurance andguarantees ofloans made byintermediaries, theConstitutional prohibition against discrimination applies with equal force. In indirect assistance programs involving loans orgrants, thisConstitutional prohibition isbuttressed bylegislation--Title VIoftheCivil Rights Actof1964. Although Federal agencies that administer these programs ofdirect andindirect assistance have largely recognized thelegal principle ofnondiscrimination, themanner inwhich they have sought totranslate this principle into intheadministra- tion oftheir programs varies widely. Inthecase ofTitle made efforts toenforce nondiscrimination requirements aggressively, butinnocase have Federal agencies implemented these nondiscrimination requirements with maximum effectiveness.

Theloan and grant programs subject toitsprovisions affect thelives ofmost Americans andareofvital importance totheNation's social and economic growth. programs, andFederal toassure whoare afforded toattack theproblem ofracial andethnic discrimination on abroad front. Title VIprovides Federal departments andagencies with strong authority tomake useofthis leverage. Thus far, however, theFederal effort under Title VIhasfailed tomatch thelaw's promise. Themechanisms developed byFederal agencies with Title VI responsibilities have glaring deficiencies. For-example, asofJune 1970, someagencies with programs subject view oftheir responsibilities under Title VI. Uniformity of interpretation hasnotyetbeen achieved even with respect tothe meaning ofbasic within the 806 administrative hierarchy. Insome instances, Title VIduties are secondary toother functions andareshared with program managers over whom theTitle VIofficers have noauthority. Rarely doagencies conduct training programs orprogram personnel to assist them indeveloping theknowledge andawareness necessary to carry outeffective Title VIcompliance programs. Inthose cases where training programs areconducted, they tend tobesuperficial and inadequate. Themethods agencies have devised forachieving andmonitoring compliance with Title VIrequirements have hadserious weaknesses. Undue reliance frequently hasbeen placed onpaper even submitted assurances. Further, although Title VIregulations provide forsubmission of compliance reports byrecipients toassist agencies indetermining their compliance status, fewagencies have made adequate useofthis important monitoring device. Insome cases, recipients ofFederal aidhave never been asked tofurnish compliance reports ortoprovide information showing racial orethnic participation intheir programs. Inothers, where information isprovided, thedata lack sufficient detail tobeofreal useasameans ofdetermining tive because information iselicited tooinfrequently (e.g., every second orthird year). 807 Ofthose agencies which have developed good compliance reporting systems most have notdeveloped thecapacity toutilize fully the data collected. review ofanyof fraction ofitsrecipients andmany ofthereviews that have been conducted have been superficial orotherwise lacking inthoroughness.

Insome instances, agencies fail toconduct anyinvestigation sanctions istermination ofFederal financial assistance. Itrarely hasbeen used. Rather, many agencies have placed sole reliance onvoluntary compliance asthemeans ofending discrimination intheir programs. There have been protracted negotia- tions with noncomplying recipients, sometimes extending over aperiod ofseveral years, while Federal funds continue toflow. Inmost instances where thesanction offund termination hasbeen used, it only after aprotracted course ofinvestigation, negotiation, hearing, andappeal andreview, during which time discrimi- natory practices often have continued unabated. Further, the mechanism ofjudicial enforcement, intended tobeused inaddition to theadministrative procedure leading tofund termination, currently isbeing used instead oftheadministration procedure, further weakening theforce ofTitle VI. Because Title VIinvolves well over 20Federal departments and agencies andcovers some400Federal loan andgrant programs, coordination ofagency efforts isofparticular importance. inadequate. 809 Under 11247, theDepartment ofJustice isvested with responsibility orresources theDepartment ofJustice views itsTitle VIresponsibility narrowly, focusing onlitigation, rather than onassuring effective administrative enforcement byvarious Federal agencies. Liaison with agencies ismaintained primarily on anadhocbasis. Theinconsistencies inagency interpretations of their responsibilities under Title VIandthegeneral inadequacy of agency compliance Programs ofInsurance andGuaranty Federally insured andguaranteed loan programs constitute a significant economic benefit formillions ofpersons intheUnited States. They involve assistance insuch keyareas ashousing, education, business entrepreneurship, andagriculture. Interms of dollar value alone, these programs will amount tosome $40billion infiscal year 1971. Although programs ofinsurance andguaranty, like 810 Title VIprograms, generally operate through intermediaries intervening between theFederal Government andindividual beneficiaries, these programs areexpressly excluded from coverage under Title VItothe extent they involve assistance solely intheform ofinsurance or programs areprohibited from practicing orpermitting discrimina- tion, either byPresidential executive order orbyregulations which they have issued. Theenforcement mechanisms established bythese Federal agencies, however, have notbeen adequate toassure compliance with their nondiscrimination requirements. Forexample, noagency requires compliance reports from intermediaries such aslending institutions. Theracial andethnic data concerning program partici- pation that agencies collect themselves, frequently areinadequate to inform theagencies whether minority group beneficiaries areparticipating onanequitable basis. None oftheagencies conducts affirmative compliance reviews todetermine firsthand whether intermediaries are following nondiscriminatory policies andpractices. Sole reliance for enforcement most frequently isplaced oncomplaint procedures. These procedures rarely have been formalized, norhave specific guidelines been setdown governing investigations andresolution little information isprovided tothepublic theexistence ofthese requirements orthe procedure tobefollowed when discrimination occurs. 811 Ifthemechanisms established toenforce Title VIhave been inadequate, thecivil rights enforcement mechanisms forprograms of insurance andguaranty areinbarely rudimentary form. Direct Assistance Programs Direct assistance programs--those inwhich Federal benefits flow directly toindividual benef iciaries--involve security, asmuch astheamount represented bygrant-in-aid programs covered byTitle VI. Discrimination indirect assistance programs clearly isprohibited bytheFifth Amendment totheConstitution. Unlike indirect assistance programs involving loans, grants, insurance orguarantees where statutory andadministrative procedures andrequirements have been established toprevent intermediaries, almost noaction hasbeen taken toimplement non- indirect itself totheproblem ofdiscrimination inthese programs, norhasthePresident ortheagencies that operate these programs taken anysignificant action toassure against such discrimination. Thus, theFederal Government isintheposition ofholding itself to alesser itimposes on others. 404-837 O-70 -S3 812 These programs, which operate without intermediaries, ofFederal officials indetermining assistance. Nonetheless, these opportunities exist andcharges ofdiscrimination have been made. Currently, little inthewayofmechanisms exists toassure equal opportunity indirect assistance programs. Compliance reviews arenotconducted. Data onracial andethnic participation frequently arenotcollected atall, andwhen collected, arenotadequately used. There also arenocomplaint procedures specifically concerned with racial orethnic discrimination, norarepersonnel given special guidance onhowsuch complaints aretobeinvestigated orwhat steps should betaken toeliminate discrimination when found. 813 Chapter 5 REGULATED INDUSTRIES ANDCIVIL RIGHTS I.Introduction Many oftheNation's largest business enterprises aresubject ofindustries which Congress ofsufficient public importance tocreate independent agencies with responsibility foroverseeing their activities, pursuant tospecific rules andregulations. Many ofthese business enterprises require Federal licenses in order toconduct business atalland, because ofthelimited number oflicenses position. radio andtelevision stations, telephone companies, andother communications enterprises arelicensed and regulated bytheFederal Communications Commission (FCC), Railroads, motor carriers, freight forwarders, andother common carriers are licensed andregulated bytheInterstate Commerce Commission (ICC), theoldest oftheregulatory agencies. Hydroelectric natural gascompanies arelicensed bytheFederal Commission (FPC) 814 Inother industries, although individual Government, their activities, nonetheless, aresubject toclose Federal regulation. Forexample, those in theshipping business areregulated bytheFederal Maritime Commission (FMC). These Federal agencies arecharged with responsibility for regulating specific industries, such aspower, communications, and transportation. Other agencies have regulatory responsibilities that cutacross industry lines. Forexample, theFederal Trade Commis- sion (FTC) hasmajor responsibility forprotecting consumers and enforcing anti-trust laws, regardless oftheindustry involved. The Securities andExchange Commission (SEC) hastheresponsibility to provide forinvestors andthepublic without governing theactivities ofthese agencies isthepublic interest. There arecivil rights issues intheactivities of these regulated industries andthere areways inwhich Rights allbusiness 25ormore employees, including most members ofregulated industries, arerequired tofollow equal employment policies. Further, totheextent that regulated businesses aregovernment contractors. 815 they also aresubject toequal employment opportunity requirements by J,/ virtue ofthat status. Beyond therequirements imposed onGovern- ment contractors andother employers, members ofregulated industries, because oftheunique federally protected status that many ofthem enjoy, should feel aspecial obligation tofurther the businesses, affirmative efforts toemploy andupgrade minority group members could contribute significantly tofurthering this cause. Bythesame token, action bytheregulatory agencies torequire andpromote equal employ- ment opportunity intheindustries they significantly totheachievement ofthis national totheissue industries, andairlines, (1965) prohibits theadoption ofaffirmative pro- grams topromote greater employment opportunities forminority group members. 816 require such large capital investments astopreclude thepossibility ofallbut avery small number ofminority group entrepreneurs from even applying forentrance. Other regulated industries, such asthose involving communications andmotor transportation, involve relatively small capital investments andoffer good opportunities forminority entrepreneurship. Forexample, thecost this aspect ofthe regulatory agencies concerned (FCC andICC, respectively) todetermine, through their licensing power, whomayconduct business inthese industries, aspecial opportunity isprovided topromote minority business ownership. Further, with respect totheradio andtelevision industries inparticular, greater minority group participation in ownership andoperation could contribute substantially togreater understanding andsensitivity onthepart underlie theunrest ofthe black andbrown minority. Another civil rights issue with which these industries andthe agencies that regulate them should beconcerned, projects, licensed andregulated bytheFPC, maybeoperated onaracially discriminatory basis, even byminority group members ormaybeofakind (boating marinas, for example) that would appeal mostly tothemore affluent.

Commission (ICC) regulates railroads andmotor carriers; theFederal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates radio and television stations, andtelephone andtelegraph companies; the Federal Power Commission (FPC) theCivil Aeronautics Board (CAB) regulates airlines; theFederal Maritime Commission (FMC) regulates water carriers. Congress also hascreated regulatory agencies with responsibility forcontrolling specific business practices, rather thanparticular industries. Forexample, theFederal Trade Commission (FTC) has responsibility forpreventing deceptive business practices and unfair competition, regardless oftheindustries inwhich these practices occur. Bythesame token, information by companies offering stock orother securities. TheSEC's authority also extends across industry lines. Thecommon standard governing allofthese regulatory agencies isthat ofserving tothe they regulate aresubject totheequal employment opportunity requirements provided under Title VIIoftheCivil Rights Actof1964. Many also are government contractors and,byvirtue ofthat status, aresubject to theequal opportunity opportunity. carrier industry andtheradio small capital investments. Byvirtue ofthelicensing authority theICCand theFCChave, these agencies could contribute significantly to facilitating greater minority business entrepreneurship .Moreover, minority participation inradio andtelevision could beofspecial help increating greater understanding inthemajority community ofthe deep-seated injustices which minority group members experience. Further, theagencies could play akeyrole ineliminating discrimination or segregation bymembers ofthe industries they regulate. Theagencies, inmost cases, have ignored their civil rights responsibilities. Inthose cases where theyhave accepted these responsibilities, their performance hasbeen disappointing. 921 Forexample, only oneofthefiveagencies that regulate specific rule regarding telephone andtelegraph companies. None oftheother agencies under consideration inthis chapter hasgiven indication oftaking asimilar step. Some aslicense renewals ofradio stations thatapparently discriminate intheir policies, have that does notconsider itsrule priority. Neither already intheindustry. Further, while most oftheagencies operate under statutes which prohibit discrimination infacilities orseirvices offered by industry members, fewhave taken even rudimentary steps tocarry out their responsibility toenforce these statutory prohibitions against overt discrimination. Little, ifanything, hasbeen done toeliminate themore subtle forms ofdiscrimination intheir as programming radio facilities cipating services andfacilities. Thefive agencies charged with responsibility forregulating specific industries have barely joined inthecivil rights effort being carried outbyother Federal departments andagencies. To theextent theyhave adopted rules andpolicies against discrimi- nation, enforce solely through theprocessing ofcomplaints. Only theFCChasadopted anaffirmative program astaff orperson with direct responsibility forimplementing the agency's civil rights functions. Thus, such important matters as devising affirmative civil rights programs, coordinating theagency's civil rights responsibilities, establishing liaison with other departments andagencies having similar civil rights functions, and proposing newideas forstrengthening theagency's civil rights performance, arelargely ignored forhandling them. TheFederal Trade Commission andtheSecurities andExchange Commission, although they donotregulate specific industries, are charged with responsibilities that carry significant civil rights implications. Forexample, theFTC, incarrying outitsresponsibility toprevent deceptive practices, could beanaffirmative force for protecting theghetto poor from unscrupulous businessmen whoexploit them. Indeed, theFTChasrecognized theneed toactinthis area. Itsoneeffort, however, involving creation ofaWashington, D.C, task force generally failed because ofinadequate staff andlack of 923 imaginative implementation. Further, incarrying outitsresponsibility toenforce anti-trust laws, theagency should beconcerned ofincipient mergers ofinformation effective civil rights enforcement. Forexample, theagency could require registering companies todisclose thefact that sanctions arebeing imposed forviolation ofFederal contract requirements under Executive Order Title VIIoftheCivil Rights Actof1964, ofpublic disclosure notonlywould tend to strengthen enforcement ofequal opportunity laws, butalso would beoflegitimate interest topotential stockholders whoare concerned overpossible into instruments however, currently prohibits useoftheproxy mechanism forthepurpose ofpromoting \"general economic, political, racial, religious, andsocial\" causes, thuspreventing socially motivated stockholders fromeven suggesting changes incompany policy related toanyofthese matters. Each oftheregulatoiry agencies considered inthis chapter can play asignificant role inpromoting ofcivil rights. None hasmade more than this role. Some failed torecognize anycivil rights responsibilities atall. Inthis Commission's view, only after all ofthese agencies have forcefully andaffirmatively topromote civil rights andendsocial andeconomic injustice canthey truly proclaim themselves tobeprotectors ofthepublic interest. CHAPTER 6 THECIVIL RIGHTS POLICY MAKERS I,Introduction Inanumber ofthecivil rights areas discussed chapters, mechanisms exist tocoordinate andfocus theefforts of departments andagencies having civil rights responsibilities in common. Inhousing, HUD ischarged bystatute with theduty of coordinating bythat law. TheCivil Service Commission isresponsible, also by Presidential Executive Order, forcoordinating theeffort to assure equal opportunity inFederal employment. Andinthearea ofprivate employment, aloose-knit arrangement among thethree agencies principally concerned with preventing private employment discrimination--OFCC, EEOC, andJustice--serves this function. There also arecoordinating mechanisms that function across subject area lines, andthere areagencies whose authority-- directly orindirectly--extends beyond coordination todecisions on overall civil rights policy anduniform methods ofassuring compliance with allcivil rights laws. Theduties andscope ofauthority of these across-the-board civil rights coordinating mechanisms differ 926 widely. Some have norole intheformulation ofcivil rights policy andprograms.

Mechanisms, outside thecontrol oftheFederal bureaucracy, are needed toserve thePresident inassuring that civil grams andpolicies arebeing carried outwith maximum effectiveness. 1034 Oneplace where Presidents have sought tolocate these mechanisms istheWhite House itself. In1961, President Kennedy created thefirst White House unit-- theSubcabinet Group Itsmost important function exchanging policy-making authority andinfact, several ofitspolicy re- commendations onsignificant civil rights issues were rejected by thePresident orhissenior staff.

Inshort, thevacuum created bythedemise were left largely tothemselves intheeffort to assure civil rights received priority agency attention. Currently, White House involvement incivil rights matters ismore structured than itprevously was. FiveWhite House staff members spend allormost oftheir timedealing with issues and programs relating tominority group citizens. They receive civil rights information through monthly agency reports andperiodic meetings with agency officials, andthrough informal meetings, such asdiscussions with minority group leaders andgovernment officials. Nonetheless, thecurrent system shares some ofthe deficiences ofthepast. Some oftheWhite House staff members assigned civil rights responsibilities have anumber ofduties in addition tocivil rights which require significant amounts of their time. Further, theagency reports consists ofmaterial which theagencies choose toinclude, making italmost impossible to evaluate accurately agency performance ortodetermine what an agency should bedoing that itisnotdoing.

They have relied mainly, or entirely, upon thereceipt ofcomplaints astheindicator ofcivil rights compliance andhave exhibited reluctance actions, such asinstituting compliance andconducting on-site reviews. 9.There hasbeen afailure toadequately coordinate and focus theFederal civil rights enforcement effort.

B.Insurance andGuaranty Programs 1.Federal programs involving financial assistance solely in orguaranty, areexpressly exempted from the effectuating provisions ofTitle VI.Although most agencies that administer insurance andguaranty programs have issued nondiscrimina- tionrequirements, either through Presidential Executive Order or ontheir own, requires compliance reports from intermediaries such aslending institutions.

Theagencies, through issuance ofappropriate rules canassure that theindustries they regulate domake such acontribution. B.Despite uniformly employment records inthese four industries, only oneoftheregulatory agencies- -FCC--has issued rules prohibiting employment discrimination. 1063 C.TheFCCandICCregulate industries (broadcasting andtrucking) which, because oftherelatively lowcapital investment necessary to enter them, offer substantial opportunities forminority entrepreneur- ship.

Like theFEBs, however. Federal Regional Councils will nothave authority tomake decisions binding ontheagencies.

Tocarry Executive under hisdirection. IntheCommission's view, what isneeded isavehicle outside the Federal bureaucracy, responsible tothePresident, toprovide the assistance heneeds insetting national civil rights goals and priorities andassuring that theactivities ofFederal agencies serve effort isthecreation ofaCabinet-level Department ofHuman Rights. SeeRipon Society Magazine ,Feb. 1969. See also R.Nathan, Jobs andCivil Rights (prepared fortheUnited States Commission onCivil Rights) 245-63 (1969). Under this proposal, allcivil rights enforcement responsibility would be transferred toanewDepartment whose sole functions would pertain to civil rights. This proposal hastheattraction ofelevating considerations ofcivil tothehighest chief ofCabinet status. Inaddition, this proposal, by consolidating allcivil rights enforcement responsibilities inoneagency, undoubtedly would contribute substantially toeliminating existing problems ofinadequate coordination among thevarious agencies with civil rights responsibilities. Oneprincipal problem with this isthat theSecretary ofHuman Rights would be,atbest, co-equal ofanumber ofother Cabinet Secretaries whose departments would continue tooperate programs having important civil rights implications. Hewould nothave theauthority toorder his Cabinet colleagues orother agency heads totake specific civil rights actions. Ifconflicts should arise, hewould have torely, asdoes onDomestic Affairs, with thefollowing responsibilities: a.Toidentify civil rights problems, develop specific national goals, andestablish government-wide priorities, policies, with thecivil rights subcommittee oftheCouncil onDomestic Affairs, andprovide civil rights guidance anddirection to0MBexaminers andother appropriate 0MBunits. (Continued from page 1) Attorney General under theexisting structure, onPresidential intervention which, asapractical matter, hecould call foronly inthemost important matters. Further, removal ofcivil rights enforcement responsibility from existing departments andagencies would tend tolower thepriority accorded tocivil rights intheir decisions onsubstantive program Rights were provided with authority toorder hisCabinet colleagues orother agency heads totake specific actions, such asterminating Federal financial assistance under programs covered byTitle VI,additional problems would arise.

These should include reference totheoverall results tobeachieved, andthecompliance andenforcement mechanisms that will be ofevery Federal department andagency asinthe case ofestablishing Assistant Secretary positions. Congress should enact such legislation. 6.ThePresident should direct theheads ofallFederal departments tocarry outtheir civil rights responsibilities effectiveness. These proposals should beevaluated by theOffice ofManagement andBudget and, where necessary, adjustments should based onarealistic assessment ofagency civil rights responsibilities andthestaff andother resources necessary to fulfill them. ThePresident should request appropriations legislation toprovide thenecessary resources andCongress should enact such legislation. 7.Allagencies with civil rights responsibilities should significantly increase their compliance andenforcement activities toassure adequate attention tothecivil rights problems ofsuch groups asSpanish-surnamed Americans, Indians RECOMMENDATIONS INSPECIFIC SUBJECT AREAS I.Employment A.Federal Employment 1.TheCivil Service Commission (CSC) should clarify itscurrent policy, emphasizing specific goals intheFederal equal employment opportunity effort anddevelop aGovernment-wide plan designed to achieve equitable minority group representation atallwage and grade levels within each department andagency. This plan should include minimum numerical andpercentage goals, coupled with specific target dates fortheir attainment, andshould training programs designed todevelop thetalents and skills ofminority group employees, particularly those atlower grade levels. Congress should amend theGovernment Employees Training Act, asnecessary, andshould appropriate sufficient funds topermit these programs tooperate 1077 cases oradverse actions involving minority group employees. b.Agencies should take appropriate disciplinary action against supervisors oradministrators whohave been found guilty ofdiscrimination. c.Adequate compensation, such asretroactive promotion and back pay, should beprovided toemployees whohave been discriminated against inpromotion actions. Totheextent legislation forthis purpose, Congress should enact andreports public promotions andseparations byrace andethnicity, andother significant facts concerning should bemade toincrease substantially thenumber ofminority group members inexecutive level positions by recruiting from sources that canprovide substantial numbers of qualified minority group employees, such ascolleges anduniversities, private industry, andState andlocal agencies. ofthe15compliance implementing OFCC's recent regulations onaffirmative action requirements, 1078 should develop acomprehensive equal employment opportunity plan, on anindustry-by-industry basis, aimed atsecuring represen- tation describing themeans bywhich they amend Title VIIoftheCivil Rights Actof1964 toauthorize theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to issue cease anddesist orders toeliminate discriminatory practices through administrative action. 2.EEOC should emphasize initiatory activities, such aspublic hearings andCommissioner ofemployment discrimination. should amend itscomplaint procedures tomake more effective enforcement useofthecomplaint processing system. Priority should beassigned tocomplaints ofparticular importance, complaints should beconsolidated wherever possible, andemphasis should beplaced onprocessing complaints involving classes of complainants rather than individuals. D.Coordination ThePresident should issue areorganization asingle independent agency. II .Housing A.Department ofHousing andUrban Development (HUD) 1.Congress should amend Rights Act toauthorize HUDtoissue cease anddesist orders toeliminate discriminatory housing practices through administrative action. 2.HUDshould establish specific fair housing goals, governing its efforts under Title VIII ofthe1968 Civil Rights Act, Title VI 1080 oftheCivil Rights Actof1964, andExeuctive Order 11063.

These sanctions should include issuance ofcease anddesist orders and, in appropriate cases, termination ofFederal mortgage lending institutions toinclude nondiscrimination clauses intheir agreements with builders, including appropriate such asacceleration ofpajmient. D.Site Selection forFederal Installations concerning VIandFederally Assisted Programs 1.Allagencies, that administer programs subject toTitle VI, should strengthen their compliance systems byassuring that the following minimum compliance activities arecarried out. a.Systematic on-site reviews ofrecipients compliance should beconducted by agencies thatadminister programs involving construction offacilities, such aspublic housing projects, recreational facilities, and highways, toassure that these facilities, through location and design, will serve minority group members onanequitable basis. d.Allagencies should establish compliance reporting systems, including collection ofdata onracial andethnic partici- pation inagency programs. These data to evaluation and, where possible discrimination isindicated, on-site compliance reviews should beconducted. 2.Agencies should place specific onthetime permitted as asubstitute forsuch proceedings. ofJustice should establish anadequately staffed administrative enforcement Federal agencies having Title VIresponsibilities, rather than onlitigation. 6.ThePresident should amend Executive Order 11247 (1965) to authorize theAttorney General todirect departments andagencies totake specific compliance andenforcement actions, including fund proceedings. B.Insurance andGuaranty Programs Agencies thatadminister programs ofinsurance andguaranty should institute todetermine compliance with existing nondiscrimination requirements oflending institutions andother intermediaries between theFederal Government andborrowers. The mechanisms should include compliance reporting systems, on-site compliance reviews, andspecific procedures forprocessing discrimi- nation complaints. C.Direct Assistance Programs Agencies which administer programs ofdirect Federal assistance should issue regulations andestablish specific mechanisms toassure against racial andethnic discrimination byFederal officials that operate these programs. Theregulations andmechanisms should provide forasystem ofperiodic reviews 1085 racial andethnic data, andappropriate disciplinary action should betaken against Federal officials found tohave practiced such discrimination. IV.Regulated Industries A.TheInterstate Commerce Commission (ICC), theCivil Aeronautics Board (CAB), andtheFederal Power Commission (FPC) should join the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) inissuing rules prohibiting employment discrimination bytheir licensees andinimplementing such employment from licensees, under which licensees would have todemonstrate that they aretaking affirmative actions to increase minority employment.

Bythesame token, thefailure toprovide sufficient resources forcivil rights agency priorities inwhich civil andenforcement mechanisms They suggest that themost serious flaw intheFederal civil rights enforcement effort hasbeen thefailure toprovide overall direction andcoordination--that thebasic mechanisms that have been lacking have been those necessary to develop acohesive, Government-wide civil rights policy andto assure that this policy isfaithfully carried out. Infact, atotal civil rights policy hasnotbeen developed. 1093 norhave overall national civil rights goals andpriorities been established togovern thecomponent parts oftheFederal civil rights effort. Agencies have operated independently with little recognition orunderstanding ofwhat theGovernment's total civil rights program isortherole they should play incarrying itout.

This report hasdealt primarily with problems ofstructure andmechanism intheGovernment's efforts toenforce civil rights laws. TheCommission recognizes, however, that achievement ofcivil rights goals andthefull exercise ofequal rights byminority group members will involve more than adjustments incivil rights enforcement machinery.

Four ofthefive agencies have issued rules tothat effect. Also significant isthe obligation oftheregulatory agencies ignored.

Federal courts have ruled that thedueprocess clause oftheFifth Amendment imposes upon theFederal Government anequivalent prohibition against racial discrimination. This principle wasfirst enunciated clearly bythe Supreme Court totheStates. Buttheconcepts ofequal protection anddueprocess, both stemming from arenotmutually exclusive.

Furthermore, many oftheareas subject toFederal regulation, because ofboth their nature andtheamount of Federal assistance they receive, arevirtually public innature. This clarifies even further theapplicability oftheFifth Amendment tothe regulated practices.

Based onthis analysis oftheconstitutional prohibitions against racial discrimination contained intheFifth andFourteenth Amendments, itappears that Federal regulatory agencies aresoclosely involved in thepractices oftheprivate entities within their jurisdiction asto bring such practices within thescope oftheFifth Amendment. These agencies aretherefore constitutionally required tomake efforts to assure nondiscrimination inthefields they regulate. II.
