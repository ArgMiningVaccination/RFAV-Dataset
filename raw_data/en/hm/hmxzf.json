Scientists, health officials and our health system's own medical experts all agree COVID19 vaccines are safe and provide the best protection against severe infection, hospitalizations, and death. Additionally, our state and region lag the nation in vaccination. As the leading academic medical center in Kansas and the Kansas City Metropolitan area, we want to help lead the way forward. For this reason, our organization now requires all students and supervising faculty, regardless of their educational institution, who perform training or shadowing on our campuses and at locations where health system employees and/or patients are present to be \"fully vaccinated\" by December 1, 2021. We will do spot checks for compliance periodically and may ask you to submit vaccination records on random employees, but we will not be the keeper of the cards. Any such students and supervising faculty joining our team after December 1, 2021, must also satisfy this requirement prior to the date of contract or engagement. Failure to complete this requirement will preclude the student or supervising faculty from education and training in our health system facilities. The \"fully vaccinated\" requirement means the individual has received an Emergency Use Authorization (EAU), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or World Health Organization (WHO) approved single dose or second of a twodose COVID19 vaccination. We will need your organization to either verify vaccination records or approved exemption upon request. We recognize some of your students and faculty may request an exemption from the vaccination requirement for disability/medical or religious/spiritual reasons. The expectation is that these students and supervising faculty will submit their accommodation requests directly to you for processing. When processing the accommodation requests, we ask that you honor those accommodation requests recognized by our organization, so we are consistent in the protections provided to our patients and employees. The health system will recognize a medical exemption from the COVID19 vaccination based on the following reasons: Documented previous severe or immediate type hypersensitivity allergic reaction (like anaphylaxis) to a previous COVID19 vaccine injection or a known component of the vaccine (e.g., Polyethylene Glycol) Other/Disability (e.g., severe emotional reaction to needles) Temporary exemption: o Currently Pregnant o Positive COVID19 test in the past 6 months (evidence of Antigen or PCR, not antibody) Example of conditions not considered for medical exemptions include, but are not limited to, the following: History of severe allergic reactions to foods, oral medications, latex, pets, insects, or environmental triggers History of immunocompromising conditions or medications which may make the vaccine less effective Breast Feeding 2 A general history of vaccine side effects or general avoidance of vaccines. Students and supervising faculty who are exempted from the COVID19 vaccination as a medical/disability or religious/spiritual accommodation will be subject to other safety measures such as weekly COVID19 testing offered at our organization. Your students and supervising faculty who are onsite at our locations will be expected to share the results of this weekly test with the health system by 11:59 p.m. on Saturday each week so we have confirmation they are not currently infected with the COVID19 virus. In the coming days, we will be contacting you to discuss our policy in more detail and to answer any questions you may have about our vaccination requirement and how it impacts your supervising faculty and students. In anticipation of this meeting, I have enclosed a copy of our Required Employee COVID 19 Vaccination Policy for your review. We wish to thankyou in advance for your efforts to help us protect our patients and ensure a safe work environment for our employees and your supervising faculty and students. "}
