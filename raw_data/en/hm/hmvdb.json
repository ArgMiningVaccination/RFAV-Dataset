I am a professionally trained Naturopathic Doctor who comes from a line of gifted healers. I underwent a career change following my own health scare. For years I suffered from digestive issues until discovering Naturopathic Medicine and some wonderful practitioners who helped me heal and thrive. As part of my practice and philosophy, I strive to educate and heal my patients, empowering them to live better and healthier lives.

By committing our higher selves, we are empowered to embark on a fascinating journey in well-being. I'm a passionate healer with an alternative approach dedicated to helping my patients move through a wide range of physical, emotional, and spiritual transitions in the most efficient and transformative way possible. My treatments are specifically tailored to the needs of each patient to make sure they receive the approach that works best for them. Time and again, I have seen the incredible healing power of my treatments. My approach is a combination of both eastern and western methods.
