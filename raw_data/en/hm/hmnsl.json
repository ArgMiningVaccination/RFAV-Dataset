It identifies ways to save the maximum amount of energy and water at a property as cost efficiently as possible with an outcome that results in: Reduced operating costs through increased energy and water efficiency Healthier living environments by improving indoor air quality for residents Decreased carbon emissions by reducing the property's environmental impact The EWCM Protocol ensures a quality report by providing templates and guidance to conduct a holistic assessment. The outcome is an investment-grade report that includes rigorous data analysis and financial analysis for each recommended measure. In the end, you'll know which product to use, when to install it, and how much you will save. The Energy Audit will include: Current Energy Use and Cost Total Reduction in Energy Use and Cost for Recommended Measures Energy and Water Conservation Measures (EWCMs) that could be installed Green Measures (GMs) that improve comfort, indoor air quality, and safety with diagnostic testing results, if needed, that could be installed Life Cycle Cost Analysis and Estimated Useful Life (EUL) for each recommended measure Financial payback of each measure using net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), savings to investment ratio (SIR), and simple payback Methodology for data collection, energy modeling software and assumptions used to make the projections Qualifications and certifications of all those who worked on the audit Representation that the Audit meets the Enterprise Audit Protocol as defined here The main process that constitutes the EWCM Protocol includes: On-site visit Energy Analysis Financial Analysis ReportingThis Protocol is derived from the following standards: Building Performance Institute, Inc. Technical Standards for Multifamily Building Analyst (2008); HERS II 2008 Technical Manual; California Title 24-2008; HUD, Energy Conservation for Housing; A Workbook; RESNET, ASHRAE; Fannie Mae Green Refinance Plus: Green PNA (2011) 1 2 3Enterprise Green Communities Multifamily Retrofit Toolkitpage 4 of 10 www.enterprisecommunity.org/retrofittoolkit Energy and Water Audit ProtocolAUDITOR QUALIFICATIONS The Protocol requires that auditors perform, at a minimum, the following tasks: Energy modeling Building assessment (limited to identifying safety, code and durability issues) Diagnostic T esting Guidelines (Attachment I ) Combustion appliance safety testing Feasibility analysis for the installation of renewable energy retrofits Construction cost estimating Financial analysis that generates investment grade level information/data (SIR, LLC and simple payback) In recognition that a single firm may not be able to fulfill all the requirements of this audit protocol, multi-disciplinary teams assembled for their complementary skill sets are welcome to apply. Applicants who do not hold these certifications but can prove equivalent training and experience will be considered on a case-by-case basis by Enterprise. Potential team members may include, but are not limited to: BPI multifamily analyst Certified Energy Manager (CEM) Mechanical engineer Electrical engineer Energy modeler General contractor Certified green building professional HERS rater Retrocommissioning agent Renewable energy expert Architect Financial expert Enterprise Green Communities Multifamily Retrofit Toolkitpage 5 of 10 www.enterprisecommunity.org/retrofittoolkit Energy and Water Audit ProtocolON-SITE VISIT Prior to the on-site visit, we suggest that a pre-audit meeting or conference call be conducted with the following parties: Auditor and their team members Owner (to include property operations and maintenance staff) Local jurisdictional staff (optional) We recommend that the pre-audit meeting occur prior to finalizing the contract for audit services with the owner. The purpose of the pre-audit meeting is to establish and confirm the understanding of the following variables: Diagnostic testing to be conducted Any previous PNAs or audits done on the property Energy modeling software to be used, and the outcome that will be reported in the final audit document Wage rates to be factored into the construction cost estimates If any subsidy or incentive funds may be involved in the project, discuss requirements that will impact the audit inspection, testing and written report The on-site visit will take place on the day of the site inspection. The purpose of the on-site visit is to collect all necessary information to conduct an appropriate energy, water, health and environmental analysis, including sufficient information to inform an energy model and financial analysis. The intent is to interview property owners and managers, evaluate the building envelope, assess building airflow, inventory HVAC equipment, identify ventilation system, field verify fan operation, and perform other diagnostic testing. Attachments Green Capital Needs Assessment Summary Table Diagnostic T esting Guidelines Enterprise Green Communities Multifamily Retrofit Toolkitpage 6 of 10 www.enterprisecommunity.org/retrofittoolkit Energy and Water Audit ProtocolENERGY MODELING AND ANALYSIS PROCESS An energy model of the building's pre- and post-retrofit performance shall be com - pleted using utility data, building plans, initial inspection data and diagnostic data collected during the on-site visits. The energy model is used to estimate annual energy consumption, carbon savings and energy cost savings of potential energy conservation measures. Current operating schedules verified on site are to be used for energy and energy cost savings estimates. Software to be used on site shall be either EnergyPro, TREAT or other as approved by Enterprise. All major assumptions used to develop the energy model and analysis must be clearly stated in the final report. Reporting emphasis should be placed on the assumptions that have the most impact on estimated energy savings. Occasionally, some building features may be inaccessible, such as wall and attic insulation. When certain building features cannot be physically verified, the default conditions should be identified as well as the justification for them. Attachments Energy Modeling Requirements Guidelines Energy & Water Audit Guidelines provides more details on the energy modeling and analysis process. Enterprise Green Communities Multifamily Retrofit Toolkitpage 7 of 10 www.enterprisecommunity.org/retrofittoolkit Energy and Water Audit ProtocolENERGY AND WATER AUDIT REPORT The auditor shall prepare a written report which will have the following features: The Executive Summary shall summarize the major findings of the audit, including: Basic building characteristics Overall physical condition of the building Recommended energy efficiency and water conservation measures Recommended green measures and other capital improvements Cost Estimate to install each recommended measure.
