It is not medical advice or medical therapy recommendations. If you are in doubt about your medical condition, please seek medical advice.\" This protocol is intended to help vaccinated people to protect themselves from the negative effects of the COVID vaccination and to help them detox the vaccine as much as possible. Furthermore, this protocol can also be used by unvaccinated people to protect themselves from the so-called \"shedding phenomenon\", i.e., symptoms occurring in unvaccinated people after they`ve been in contact with someone who\u00b4s been vaccinated. On the mechanism of action of the COVID vaccines: All vaccines currently in use in Europe, i.e., the Biontech/Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson vaccine, contain synthetic genetic material of the coronavirus, which causes the cells of vaccinated people to produce the spike protein, an envelope protein of the coronavirus. In the next step, the body then forms antibodies against the spike protein, which, when coming into contact with a coronavirus, are supposed to render the virus harmless. We now know that the spike protein circulates inside the bodies of vaccinated individuals after vaccination and that it is most likely being excreted through respiration, through the skin, and through bodily fluids such as sweat, saliva, or semen - a phenomenon known as \"shedding\". The spike protein can cause immense problems in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, since this protein alone seems to be the main cause for the corona symptomatology and since it is capable of damaging the body through various mechanisms. Here are some examples of the possible negative effects of the vaccines and the spike protein: 1. First of all, with all vaccines there is a risk of integration into our DNA. If this were to happen, among other things, there would be an increased risk of cancer and also the possibility that the cells of vaccinated individuals could permanently produce spike protein, which would expose them to the negative effects of the spike protein long-term. 2. The spike protein can lead to inflammation in the lungs, the heart, or vascular walls (which can lead to blood clots), primarily caused by the binding of the spike protein to certain receptors, called ACE2 receptors, in these tissues. 3. Another mechanism by which the spike protein - or rather the antibodies formed against the spike protein - can affect health, results from the similarity of the spike protein to human proteins. Vaccination can lead to the formation of autoantibodies, i.e., antibodies directed against one's own tissues, and thus to autoimmune disease. Examples are: - ITP, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a lack of platelets, since platelets are being destroyed by autoantibodies, which can lead to bleeding and strokes. - Guillan-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), a form of polyneuropathy in which, among other things, muscle weakness occurs - autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), a destruction of red blood cells - or Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disease of the thyroid, to name just a few 4. The similarity of the spike protein to syncytin, a protein needed to form the placenta, could lead to infertility via autoantibodies against syncytin. 5. Another risk of vaccinating against COVID is the development of ADE (Antibody Dependent Enhancement). Due to a special feature of the antibodies formed against coronaviruses (MERS and SARS coronaviruses promote the formation of binding instead of neutralizing antibodies), coming into contact with a coronavirus after having been vaccinated can result in the virus not being rendered harmless, but, on the contrary, the antibodies against the coronavirus leading to a particularly severe course of disease with cytokine storm (excessive immune reaction), massive inflammatory responses in the respiratory tract and even death. 6. A health risk which only arises from the mRNA vaccines, i.e., the Biontech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, results from the use of lipid nanoparticles in these vaccines. On the one hand, these vaccines contain PEG (polyethylene glycol), to which about 70% of the population already react allergic. PEG can trigger allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock. On the other hand, the mRNA-vaccines contain cationic lipids, which are cytotoxic and thus are able to cause cell damage and inflammation. 7. A couple of weeks ago, at the University of Almeria in Spain, the contents of a vial of the Biontech/Pfizer vaccine were examined. The result: the main ingredient in this vial was graphene oxide. Graphene oxide can cause inflammation of the mucous membranes including pneumonia, a loss of the sense of taste and smell, and blood clots. And graphene oxide depletes the reserves of our most important detoxification molecule glutathione. It also leads to strong magnetic properties of the body, so it could be an explanation for the magnetism that many vaccinated people develop after vaccination. By now, several researchers, including a research group led by German biophysicist Andreas Kalcker and Dr. Robert O. Young in the US, have confirmed the presence of graphene oxide in all corona vaccines. Those are the risks that people are almost certainly being exposed to when getting vaccinated. But there are also thousands of unvaccinated people, who are reporting symptoms, such as increased menstrual bleeding, severe menstrual pain, skin rashes, dizziness, palpitations and arrhythmia, etc., after they\u00b4ve been in contact with someone who\u00b4s been vaccinated. So it is likely that there is a transfer of spike protein (or some other molecule) taking place that can lead to health problems even in the unvaccinated. Moreover, unvaccinated people are now also reporting being magnetic. One explanation for the occurrence of magnetism in unvaccinated people could be the presence of graphene oxide in masks, PCR tests, and other vaccines, such as the flu vaccine. Now, what can we do ? The top priority in both vaccine detox and protection from or treatment of shedding symptoms is to protect the body from the negative effects of the spike protein, and to help it break down and eliminate the spike protein as quickly as possible. In addition, there is the detoxification of and the protection from the effects of graphene oxide and - in individuals, who have been vaccinated with an mRNA-vaccine - lipid nanoparticles. General supportive measures include: - A diet that neither promotes inflammation nor activates the immune system, that is: Sugar, animal proteins, such as meat, fish, eggs or dairy products, processed foods, GMOs, i.e., genetically modified foods, gluten, and toxic fats, such as canola oil, should at least be reduced, if possible even avoided altogether. - Furthermore, intermittent fasting and sauna sessions help boost autophagy, the natural elimination of abnormal cells and damaged proteins. Autophagy makes a crucial contribution to the degradation of spike protein and the elimination of cells damaged by this protein, but is especially disrupted by viruses such as Reward Your Curiosity Everything you want to read.
