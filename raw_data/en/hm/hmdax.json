Until the ABLE Act became law, creating a SNT was the only legal way to save money without sacrificing eligibility for government benefits. There are three distinct types of Special Needs T rusts: third party/supplemental trusts, first party/pay-back or self-settled/d(4)(A) trusts, or pooled Special Needs T rusts. The funds in the special needs trust supplement but do not supplant government benefits. Generally, Special Needs T rusts are easy to tailor to specific needs and can handle larger sums of money, for example, from a settlement. However, in New Jersey, a SNT must be established in accordance with specific Medicaid guidelines in order to preserve an individual's eligibility for benefits. For more information, visit: https://www.state.nj.us/humanservices/dmahs/ clients/snt.html Qualified Income Trust A Qualified Income T rust (QIT), also known as a Miller T rust, is a special legal arrangement for holding a person's income. A QIT is a written trust agreement for which the trustee establishes a dedicated bank account. The income deposited into this dedicated bank account is disregarded when determining financial eligibility for Long T erm Services and Supports. QIT s require that a trustee is appointed to manage the monthly deposits and expenses and account for the funds in the trust. A trustee must be someone other than the Medicaid applicant/ recipient. QIT written agreements have special conditions that must be met and are subject to the approval of, and monitoring by, the appropriate Medicaid eligibility determining agency (EDA) and the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS).

Different parts of Medicare cover different services. See the guide on page 19 for the breakdown of coverage. Some people get Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) automatically and other people have to sign up for it. In most cases, it depends on whether you're getting Social Security benefits. If you aren't getting benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board at least 3 months before you turn 65, you'll need to sign up with Social Security to get Part A and Part B. Because you must pay a premium for Part B coverage, you can turn it down. However, if you decide to enroll in Part B later, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as you have Part B coverage. While costs vary, Medicare typically pays 80 percent of the cost of covered services while you are responsible for the remaining 20 percent plus any required coinsurance or deductibles for each benefit period. Medigap When an individual who is aged or disabled is not covered by an employer or union health care plan, it is possible to buy a supplemental policy to help bridge the gaps in original Medicare coverage. These policies are called Medigap insurance. Medigap policies must follow federal and state laws and are standardized, so you can compare them. Standardized policies cover co-payments for certain benefits. Medigap policies may also offer additional benefits, such as coverage for the hospital deductible, at an extra cost. Medicare does not pay for any of the costs of a Medigap policy. T o buy a Medigap policy, you must be enrolled in Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. For a list of Medigap plans available in New Jersey, visit: https://www.state.nj.us/humanservices/doas/services/ship/index.html When to apply for Medicare: You should sign up for Medicare three months before reaching age 65, even if you are not ready to start receiving retirement benefits. During the Medicare application, you can opt out of receiving cash retirement benefits and will always have the option to apply for them later.

It applies to all flights in the United States and to flights to, or from, the United States by foreign airlines. It prevents airlines from refusing to transport a passenger solely because of a disability; limits the circumstances under which passengers with disabilities must provide advance information about their disabilities to air carriers; states that assistive devices do not count against passenger baggage limits; and sets accessibility guidelines for airplane facilities. Airline personnel must provide routine physical assistance but are not required to provide what would customarily be regarded as personal care assistance. However, if a passenger requires an attendant, the airline must transport the attendant free of charge. The law does not require an airline to transport an individual who may endanger the health or safety of others. The Act mandates that a Complaints Resolution Officer (CRO) be immediately available to resolve disputes between airlines and passengers with disabilities. www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/passengers-disabilities Voting Accessibility for Individuals with disabilities Requires polling places across the United States to be physically accessible to people with disabilities for federal elections or to provide an alternate means of casting a ballot on the day of the election.

Such disabilities often come on quickly and unexpectedly, often affect multiple areas of our lives and can happen to anyone. Examples include aneurysms, strokes, spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries, multiple sclerosis and ALS. Services for individuals with adult onset disabilities are administered through many service systems. Most, but not all, are typically income based and/or have level- of-care requirements that must be met to qualify. If you or someone you know has an adult onset disability, call the Division of Disability Services (DDS) for information and referral to assistance services. The Division of Disability Services (DDS) provides a single point-of-entry for people seeking disability-related information in New Jersey.

Some Examples of developmental disabilities are: Down Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, Autism Spectrum Disorders and Muscular dystrophy. However, it's important to remember that the definition of a developmental disability is not based on diagnosis alone. It's dependent upon the age at which the disability occurred and the effect on one's long-term abilities to complete activities of daily living. Therefore, injuries to the brain or spinal cord incurred before the age of 21 may also qualify as developmental disabilities provided they are permanent and effect an individual's ability to complete day-to- day tasks in three or more areas of life activity. 73 In New Jersey, services for individuals with intellectual/ developmental disabilities (I/DD) are categorized into children services or adult services: Services for Children with I/DD: (Birth-age 21): are administered through the NJ Children's System of Care, under the Department of Children and Families, through PerformCare. See page 74. Services for Adults with I/DD: (21 and older): are administered through the Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD).

PerformCare is also the single point of access to behavioral health and substance use treatment services for New Jersey youth up to the age of 21. For more information on those services, see chapter 15. The service system for children with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities is designed to help families meet the needs of children with I/DDs that are not being met through school-related services, medical services reimbursable by health insurance or by other existing supports or services. Services through this program are administered based upon level of care and the availability of funds.* See more about early intervention and educational entitlement services in chapter 11. Services through PerformCare include the following: Family Support Services (FSS): FSS services provide caregiver relief (Respite), assistive technology, home and vehicle modifications, and assistance with summer camp during summer breaks from school. Connection with local Care Management Organizations (CMOs): CMOs are agencies that provide a full range of treatment and support services to children with the most complex needs. They work with child-family teams to develop individualized service plans. The CMO's goals are to keep children in their homes, schools and communities. Out of Home (OOH) services and supports: provide out-of-home treatment for youth who are not able to safely be cared for at home. If a youth or young adult (under age 21) requires OOH T reatment, PerformCare will work with the family's Care Management Organization (CMO) to identify the least restrictive type of treatment setting to best meet a child's identified needs. T o access developmental disability services for children: an application for developmental disability determination of eligibility must be submitted. v For children under the age of 18 (although services are provided until age 21), the application must be submitted to P erformCare. Applications can be completed online through a secure portal or are available to download and *Under the direction of the New Jersey Council on Developmental Disabilities (NJCDD), the Regional F amily Support Planning Councils assist the Children 's System of Care in the allocation of funding for family support services by making recommendations based on input they receive from families.

Thereafter, the incapacitated person is referred to as the \"individual receiving guardianship services.\" Many individuals with developmental disabilities are capable of making their own decisions with appropriate support and advice, and do not need a guardian. What types of guardianship are there? The two types of guardianships involve guardianship of property and guardianship of a person. Many times both types are required to protect an individual receiving guardianship services, but sometimes only one type is necessary. The guardian of the property has a duty to locate and marshal the assets of the individual receiving guardianship services. This includes all assets such as bank accounts, stocks, personal property and real estate. The guardian is required to file an initial inventory and to swear that it is accurate and complete. The assets are placed in the name of the guardian. It is the responsibility of the guardian to ensure that all assets are safeguarded and spent appropriately. Annual accountings are required to be filed with the court for review and are subject to the court's approval. The guardianship of the person is appointed to watch over and make major life decisions for the individual receiving guardianship services until the reason for incapacity no longer exists and the court has deemed the person as capable. The guardian of the person makes decisions affecting everything from the individual receiving guardianship services' residence, visitation, medical care, socialization, travel and other areas of their life. Guardians of the person are required to file annual reports with the court to inform as to the status and well-being of the individual receiving guardianship services. What's the difference between full and limited guardianship? Generally, a court will consider delegating an individual's decision-making rights in the following areas: residential, vocational, medical, financial, educational and legal. 22 97In a plenary, or full, guardianship, all of these rights are delegated to the guardian and no rights are reserved to the individual receiving guardianship services. In a limited guardianship, some delegable rights are delegated to the guardian while the individual receiving guardianship services reserves other rights. What is the role of the guardian? All guardians are responsible for: v Assisting the individual to participate with the guardian in the decision-making process, to the maximum extent of the individual's ability, to encourage the individual to act on their own behalf whenever able to do so; v Encouraging the individual to develop or regain higher capacity to make decisions to the maximum extent possible in those areas in which they are in need of a guardian; v Making decisions and giving consents on behalf of the individual, but only to the extent of the court order; v Protecting the individual from harm; v Looking out for the individual's interests; v Safeguarding the individual's human and civil rights; v Ensuring that the individual's physical, emotional and developmental needs, including education and training, are met; v Acting consistently with a previously executed power of attorney for health care or advance directive; v Helping the individual to obtain all available and appropriate benefits and supportive services; v Visiting the individual not less than once every three months; v Initiating legal action on the individual's behalf; and v Submitting reports to the court as specified by the court. A guardian is NOT responsible for: v Providing for the individual from his or her own funds; v Any liability to another person for acts of the individual; v Injury to the individual from the wrongful conduct of another person providing medical or other care; v Taking the individual into the guardian's home to live; v Consenting to shock treatment, psychosurgery, sterilization or medical, behavioral or pharmacological research without further order of the court.. Chapter 22 Guardianship 98New Jersey Resources 2020-2021 Department of Human ServicesAre there alternatives to guardianship? Yes. In New Jersey, an individual may appoint a Power of Attorney (POA) to make decisions on their behalf. The individual with the disability must be able to understand on a basic level that they are appointing someone to make decisions on their behalf. In addition: v A person must be able to give consent; v A POA can cover person and/or property; v A POA can be revoked and/or changed at any time, based on changing needs; v A POA is significantly less costly than guardianship; and v It is best to work through an attorney to establish POA Supported Decision Making In supported decision-making, there is no court-appointed legal guardian to make decisions for a person. Instead, the individual makes his or her own decisions with the assistance and support of a trusted person or people, such as friends, family members, advocates or others. More information about supported decision-making can be found through the National Resource Center for Supported Decision-Making at: www.supporteddecisionmaking.org How does one establish a guardianship? In recent years courts have streamlined the application to facilitate families or interested parties who might seek a guardianship for an alleged person needing a guardianship on a pro se basis or self-representation in the court without an attorney. Complaints can also be filed by an attorney. T o establish guardianship for an incapacitated adult, a Verified Complaint must be filed with the Surrogate's Court in the county where the alleged incapacitated person resides. The Complaint must include particular information and must be supported by affidavits of physicians or other clinical professional such as a psychologist, advance practice nurse or in certain circumstances, the child study team, as permitted by the court. based upon recent examinations of the alleged incapacitated person. Once a Complaint is filed, the court will enter an order appointing an attorney for the alleged incapacitated person and schedule a hearing. If the court determines that the person is incapacitated, then a judgment will be entered appointing guardian(s). Before the guardian(s) can act on behalf of the incapacitated person, they must appear before the County Surrogate to qualify as guardian, including by posting a bond if required.

Surrogate's Courts The Surrogate's Court can provide assistance on all matters affecting estates, guardianships, and other probate matters. The Surrogate is responsible for determining the validity of wills, appointing administrators for estates and guardians for minors and incapacitated persons, and appointing trustees where applicable.

Bureau of Guardianship Services Chief, Jessica Anastasi PO Box 705 T renton, NJ 08625-0705 (609) 631-2213 Under the auspices of the Department of Human Services, Central Office, the Bureau of Guardianship Services (BGS) is the state entity designated to provide guardianship services to adults who are receiving functional services from the Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD). When a person reaches the age of 18, they have full legal responsibility for themselves regardless of any disability, except, when determined necessary by the court, a guardian may be appointed to make decisions on their behalf. BGS has two statutory responsibilities: First, BGS may file a petition through the Office of the Attorney General, for the appointment of a guardian for an eligible adult in need of a guardian. Second, BGS may serve as guardian of the person for a DDD eligible consumer where there is no known family or other interested party able or willing to serve as guardian of the person. BGS does not pursue guardianships of the property- only guardianships of the person. BGS is only able to assist individuals who receive services funded by the Division of Developmental Disabilities. Individuals must apply to DDD to receive an eligibility determination. See chapter 18. 101102New Jersey Resources 2020-2021 Department of Human ServicesChapter 23: Service Dogs A service dog is defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability. The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person's disability. v Under the ADA and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (NJLAD), a place of public accommodation cannot refuse admittance of a service dog when it is accompanying a person with a disability. v The ADA/NJLAD requires that places of public accommodation (which include privately-owned businesses that serve the public) allow people with disabilities to bring service dogs into any area in which customers are generally allowed. v The ADA/NJLAD does not require that a service dog be certified or have special identification, but it is not inappropriate for a business to ask if a dog that does not have an identifying vest or a special harness is a service animal rather than a pet. The business may not, however, insist on proof of certification before permitting admittance of a service dog accompanying a person with a disability. v It is a violation of the ADA/NJLAD for a business to charge a cleaning or maintenance fee when a person with a disability has brought a service dog into the place of business. However, the owner of the animal has sole responsibility for its behavior and may be charged for any damages the animal causes as long as the business has a policy of charging non- disabled customers for damages that they cause. Likewise, it is not a violation of the ADA/NJLAD to exclude a service dog from a place of public accommodation if the animal behaves in a loud, threatening, or uncontrolled manner, creating a substantial disturbance or posing a direct threat to the safety of others.
