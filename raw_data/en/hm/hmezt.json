It gives us physical power and provides mental balance and emotional stability to meet modern life challenges successfully. Responding to a call by the Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the United Nations General Assembly on 11 December 2014 declared 21st June as the International Day of Yoga. International Yoga Day is celebrated across the wor ld through various activities and programs related to Yoga and health. It is bein g celebrated for the last six years, resulting in Yoga emerging as an important p ublic health movement throughout the world. It is especially relevant in India because the role of Yoga in public health policies and behaviour has signifi cantly increased in the past few years. IntroductionTo include Yoga into the mainstream International Day of YogaNarendra Modi addressing the United Nations General Assembly on 27.09.2014 Yoga is an invaluable gift of our ancient tradition. Yoga embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfilment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and nature. Changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness can help us deal with climate change. So let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day. 23The resolution adopted by the General Assembly of t he United Nations on 11 December, 2014.Steps in the past The steps taken to add Yoga and other Ayush systems of health to public health programs in the initial decades of Independence were slow and limited though the direction was forward-looking and progressive. These steps included establishing the Central Yoga Research Institute in 1976 (which later became the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga) and the Central Council for Yoga and Naturopathy in 1978. These two bodies worked as the implementing arms of the government in various activities to promote Yoga. Government efforts to include Yoga in public health got a fillip in the 9th five- year plan when some new development processes were initiated to bring AYUSH into the mainstream. 4Yoga is beautiful because it is ancient yet modern... it is constant yet evolving. Narendra Modi. International Day of Yoga, 2018 5Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, Delhi Before this Yoga was not recognised as a healthcare system even in official documents but only as a therapy. In 1995 attention was focused on developing all Ayush systems, including yoga by including Ayush healthcare systems under the newly created department of Indian Health Systems and Homoeopathy. The approaches to the 9th plan included reforms in the quality of primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare, investment in human resource development and improvement in the quality of services offered by physicians in all the areas of Ayush, including Yoga. Apart from this, it also focused attention on the conservation, cultivation and research of medicinal plants and herbs and completing the pharmacopoeia of all systems of AYUSH. Emphasis was also given to promoting research in order to bring about reforms in the information and knowledge available to national healthcare programs regarding Yoga and AYUSH during the 9th plan. Challenges faced Yoga is beyond the constraints of age, gender, caste, community, religion and nations. Narendra Modi. International Day of Yoga, 2018 Even though there were steps which contributed to the spread of Yoga, the speed remained slow. In the meantime, the name of the Indian Health Systems and Homoeopathy department was changed to the department of AYUSH in November 2003 to bring a sharper focus on the development of Ayush systems. This initiative provided a fillip to Yoga to some extent. Efforts to bring Yoga into the mainstream through programmes like 'Yoga in School Health' (in which school teachers were trained and a Yoga Teacher Manual was published) and 'Yoga in Parks' continued but only with limited success. In another effort, nearly 150 Swami Vivekanand District Yoga Health Centres were established that benefited more than 8 lakh patients. But the scheme had to be closed due to its structural limitations. 67 Narendra Modi performing YogaDespite all efforts, Yoga and other AYUSH systems c ould not manifest their full potential because the existing healthcare instituti ons had to face shortages of manpower, basic amenities and other facilities. The net impact of these shortcomings was that the A YUSH systems and Yoga and their practitioners were not part of National H ealth programmes. Thus, even though the benefits of bringing Yoga into the mainstream had been recognised for a long time, this purpose could not be fulfilled without a clear approach and solid actions. Steps taken for promoting Yoga Narendra Modi. International Day of Yoga, 2016 What has been the impact of the International Day of Yoga programme in bringing Yoga into the mainstream? Just as the mobile phone has become a part of life you can make Yoga too a part of your life. The situation started changing when in May 2014, the new government changed the government thinking and approach towards the role of Yoga and its relevance in public health. The first significant sign of the change occurred on 9th November 2014 when a dedicated Ministry of Ayush was created for Ayush, and now Yoga has become a part of it. Since 2014 Yoga has received tremendous encouragement under the brilliant leadership of the honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji. 89Yoga Day at Paris, France & LondonOn 11th December 2014, 193 members of the UNGA and 173 co-sponsor countries unanimously approved the resolution of the United Nations in which the establishment of 21st June as the International Day of Yoga was passed. In its resolution, the UNGA agreed that Yoga offers a holistic approach to health and well-being, and that widespread promotion about the benefits of practising Yoga is necessary for the global population's health. Yoga brings about harmony in all areas of life and is known for its significant role in preventing diseases, promoting health, and treating many disorders related to lifestyle. Yoga Day at Times Square, New York & Cairo, Egypt Since 21st June, 2015 the International Day of Yoga is being celebrated across the globe through various activities and programmes relating to Yoga and well- being. Thousands of people in countries world wide have joined the International Day of Yoga activities to participate in them. As a result, it has become a public movement for health at the global l evel. India plays a significant role in celebrating International Yoga Day. The Ministry of Ayush is the nodal Ministry for all the Yoga-related activities and has designed a \"Common Yoga Protocol (CYP)\" programme to celebrate International Yoga Day in a standard and beneficial manner. The CYP is a 45 minutes programme of appropriate Yogasana practices that expert have carefully created. Both the young and the old can practice these without any trouble. It is based on yogic traditions and various techniques based on scientific knowledge. The Ministry of Ayush is trying to make the Common Yoga Protocol (CYP) accessible to as many people as possible so that every single member of society can benefit from Yoga. As a result, the CYP has emerged as a widely accepted format of daily Yoga practice in a short time. 10Reforms by the concerned ministry regarding organising the International Day of Yoga The Yoga Day has become one of the biggest mass movements in thequest for good health and well-being. Narendra Modi. International Day of Yoga, 2018 11Inspired by the immense enthusiasm and passion generated in common citizens by the International Day of Yoga celebrations, the Ministry of Ayush has initiated reforms and development in Yoga, adopting a holistic approach. These reforms include n Establishment of the National Yoga and Naturopathy Promotion and Development Board, a national level advisory body n Encouragement to Yoga certification to ensure quality and excellence in Yoga training, means of skill development, n Motivation to evidence-based research in Yoga with the help of prestigious institutions like an AIIMS n Promotion of Yogasana as competitive sports n Massive outreach efforts through governmental and private collaborations n Enhancing access to Yoga treatment and training through a network of 12500 Ayush Health and Wellness Centres, and n Starting a universal project called 'Yoga for All' to reach the entire population in five years (the scheme is in its final stage now). These aspects have been discussed in detail below.Yoga practice at Qutub Minar The National Yoga and Naturopathy Promotion and Dev elopment Board was set up in February 2016, by the Ministry of Ayush, under the Hon'ble Minster of Ayush, to advise the Ministry on various program mes for the development of yoga, as well as to seek guidance from the Minis try in matters of policy. The Ministry has benefited considerably from the in puts received from the Board in strengthening several aspects of the pract ice of Yoga. To improve the quality of Yoga training available to the citiz ens of the entire country, the certification of Yoga professionals and the verific ation of Yoga organisations were recognised by the Ministry as matters of prior ity. Work was initiated on these issues with the cooperation of the Indian Qua lity Council and was later centralised under the Yoga Certification Board (YCB ), which had been established to function as a special body. n Currently, the activities of the YCB include the certification of Yoga professionals, verification of Yoga organizations, approval of Yoga professionals' certification bodies and the grading of Yoga organizations according to placement standards. n YCB aims to prepare skilled Yoga professionals throughout India who can feed the global need for Yoga training of high standards. n As an additional initiative, the Ministry of Ayush has collaborated with the Ministry of Skill Development and Enterprise to remove all the gaps between the demand and supply of skilled yoga trainers and different aspects of skill development in yoga. In this collaboration, cross verification in yoga training and promotion of similar standards have been envisaged. 12Evidence-based research in Yoga 13The promotion of evidence-based research in Yoga has been accorded high priority, and cooperation with prestigious institutions like AIIMS has been prioritised under the work policy to integrate basic science and high standards of modern medicine in Yoga research. An excellent example of this work policy is the Cen tre for Integrative Medicine and Research (CIMR) at AIIMS, New Delhi, which is f unded under the Centre of Excellence Scheme of the Ministry of Ayush. It has obtained excellent research outcomes in the field of integrative treatment of v arious disorders by using Yoga. Similar collaborative research efforts through the autonomous body under the Ayush ministry, the Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN) include yoga therapy in mental health, Covid- 19, heart diseases and cancer. Collaborating institutions include NIMHANS Bengaluru, AIIMS Rishikesh, HSC group of cancer hospitals, Indian Association for Palliative Care and Indian Cancer Society etc. The decision taken by the union cabinet in March 2020 for running 12500 Ayush health and wellness centres under the Ayushman Bharat scheme is an essential step in learning Yoga and making enhanced public access to its therapeutic benefits throughout the country. These health and wellness centres will be established in phases from 2019 - 20 to 2023- 24. These will set up and create a holistic well-being model based on the principles and practices of Ayush in order to reduce expenditure. Yoga will be an important part of this activity, and many yoga professionals will be appointed for this. To make it functional, approval has been given for nearly 4000 health and wellness centres for states/UT, and their set-up is under progress. The Ministry is finalising and implementing a universal project, \"Yoga for All\" aimed at reaching the entire population of India in the next five years. The effectiveness of Yoga in increasing productivity is well known, but this capability of Yoga has not been harnessed fully. From farmers to professors, people from all walks of life can adopt Yoga to perform their daily tasks better and more efficiently. n The aim of the \"Yoga for All\" programme is to take yoga to every single family. It aims to train at least one member from each family in 75,000 selected villages as a regular Yoga practitioner by 15th August 2022. n This programme will subsequently cover the entire country by 2025- 26. To achieve this objective, the Ministry of Ayush will prepare an extensive calendar of Yoga training programmes in association with various stakeholders, including participating ministries, and with the help of state governments. 1415Who has benefited from efforts to bring yoga into the mainstream? Yoga,which connects body, mind and soul, is playing extremely important role in connecting the world with India. Narendra Modi. International Day of Yoga, 2017 All the reforms for bringing yoga into the mainstream are being integrated and included in the International Day of Yoga. The Ministry of Ayush successfully organises the International Day of Yoga (IDY) all over the country. It has received widespread public support, and it is celebrated with great enthusiasm in almost every corner of the country. Furthermore, by initiating the Common Yoga Protocol (CYP) millions of people get access to an exact entry point into Yoga at the same time. The Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN) had estimated the number of people participating in the CYP based friendly yoga demonstration on international yoga day, 2016, as nearly 85 lacs. It was based on the figures given by stakeholder institutions. However, this number leapfrogged in the subsequent years and reached 9 crores on the International Day of Yoga, 2019. Keeping in view the Covid pandemic in 2020, the honourable Prime Minister had given a call to the nation to celebrate Yoga Day at home, titled \"Yoga at home, Yoga with family.\" Accordingly, several digital outreach methods are adopted to facilitate Common Yoga Protocol training at home and encourage people to participate in the International Day of Yoga. This has received unexpectedly sizeable public support. 1617According to the figures given by the stakeholder o rganisations, the Ministry has estimated that a total of 1.52 crore families t ook part in the friendly yoga demonstrations on the International Day of Yoga on 21st June, 2020. In addition to that, around 5.97 crore individuals als o participated in the International Day of Yoga, 2020. Based on these sta tistics, India's total number of IDY 2020 participants was estimated to be around 12.06 crore. Many of those who participated in CYP in a festive mode continued to practice Yoga even after IDY. It has been learnt that after the initiation of IDY, most of those who had earlier discontinued the regular Yoga practice of Yoga, again joined the Yoga fold during subsequent IDYs, and se veral of them started practicing Yoga regularly. This led to considerable health benefits to yoga pr actitioners in large numbers, ultimately making India a healthy nation.Even when one looks beyond the influence on millions of those who got motivated by IDY for Yoga practice, it is observed that IDY has impacted many sectors. The demand for Yoga teachers has significantly increased. Since India has numerous popular and efficient Yoga institutions where Yoga teachers are trained, hundreds of such trained Yoga teachers got the opportunity of permanent employment. Many of these instructors got employed in foreign countries. 18This day sends out the message of universal brotherhood. It is the day of oneness of humanness. That, which brings us together, is Yoga. That, which narrows down distances, is Yoga. Today, the world is realising the importance of Yoga even more due to the Coronavirus pandemic. If our immunity is strong then we can more effectively defeat this disease. Narendra Modi. International Day of Yoga, 2020The number of foreign tourists coming to India for Yoga training has increased significantly since IDY 2015; in four years, i.e., in 2018 the number increased by 37.4% (Tourism Statistics at a Glance, Ministry of Tourism, 2014, 2018). Utilising this deepening interest in Yoga, the Health Care In dustry has presented various solutions to health seekers. Yoga is now in creasingly used in hospitals of all disciplines for the management/treatment of both physical and mental diseases. Narendra Modi International Day of Yoga, 2016 As many of you have already come to know that Yoga is much more than just a physical exercise\u2014 apart from enabling us to cultivate integrated outlook and bring well-being, it enables us to achieve newer dimensions for ourselves.\" \"As many of you have already come to know that Yoga is much more than just a physical exercise\u2014 apart from enabling us to cultivate integrated outlook and bring well-being, it enables us to achieve newer dimensions for ourselves.\" 19 Yogasana: A Competitive Sport The Ministry of Ayush and the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs have recently recognized Yogasana as a Competitive Sport formally. Yoga postures, which primarily consist of physical dimensions of Yoga, are fit for being recognized as a competitive spor t and this initiative has immense potential of getting worldwide acceptance and converting Yogasana into a world sport. This will ensure the entry of novel techniques and strategies into this subject, thereby helping our sportspersons and officials to transform this sector into a fruitful and efficient industry. Although Yogasana has been a competitive sport for a long, it lacked due recognition from the Government of India to officially become a recognized competitive sport in the country. With active support from numerous stakeholders, the International Yogasana Sports Federation was constituted last year. The National Yogasana Sports Federation was also constituted, and in November 2020, the Sports Ministry recognized it as National Sports Federation. 2021A total of 51 medals have been proposed in 4 sports under 7 categories: Yogasana, Artistic Yoga (individual and double), Rthymic Yoga (individual and group), Individual Allrounder Championship and Team Championship. Yogasana will also be included in the Khelo India programme. Its popularity is bound to increase in India, and it will be included in the school and university programme of Khelo India. Efforts would be made to include Yogasana in Asian Games and Olympic sports in the future. The acceptance of Yoga as therapeutic support for health and treatment of lifestyle-related issues is established because since 2014 the increase in research publications on Yoga as an experimental clinical therapy has been tenfold (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). As a result of this, Yoga-based clinical trials have also increased 8 times, and most of these cases were those where participants had come from foreign countries.Yoga departments have been introduced in universities and medical education institutions in India and abroad, running Yoga classes for different types of requirements. Yoga has entrenched itself as a vital constituent of the fitness industry. The number of Yoga practitioners has increased manifold year after year. The number of Yoga schools and Yoga studios has risen dramatically worldwide during the past five years. Yoga has figured at the 7th place in the Top-10 list of ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine). 22All of you are Yoga ambassadors who are taking forward an indivisible message for the world. I thank you all for your commitment and welcome you as sisters and brothers of extended Indian family. Narendra Modi. International Day of Yoga, 2020It has attained a special place in various advertis ements and electronic media campaigns. Industries related with Yoga equipment l ike Yoga mats and other ancillary items are also flourishing. Demand for ec o-friendly products like Cotton garments, Jute, Cork and Natural Rubber has also seen an upward trend, resulting in enhanced opportunities for MSME entrepreneurs in the market.23In the last 5 years, IT-based solutions have brought about a sea change in the way masses are trained in Yoga practices. These solutions include Online Yoga classes, Applications that focus on post Yoga relaxation postures, Smart Yoga mats that motivate accurate observance of correct Asana postures and Applications that keep an eye on the breathing process. Books, magazines and journals on Yoga have increased in India and foreign countries, apart from a parallel increase in Yoga related blogs.

A dedicated 10-episode TV series, underscoring various dimensions of the Common Yoga Protocol (CYP) for different stakeholders, including women and children, was telecast on DD India. The launch of Namaste Yoga App for making Yoga accessible to all at any point of time marked another technological milestone achieved by the Ministry.As a part of commemorating 75 years of independence, the Ministry of Culture organised 7th IDY at 75 cultural sites of the country with all due precautions. 25Ministry of Ayush undertook several activities and campaigns in association with the MyGov platform to promote and people's engagement with IDY 2021.
