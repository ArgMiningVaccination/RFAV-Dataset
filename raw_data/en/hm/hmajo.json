It is important for clinicians to routinely ask patients about their CAM use, but making recommendations about use, especially in conjunction with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy remains problematic due to lack of research of the potential benefits or harmful effects of these combinations. CAM use (both self-medication with products and visits to CAM practitioners) increased from 1998 to 2005 in our samples. Now that more than 80 percent of all women with breast cancer report using CAM (41 percent in a specific attempt to management their breast cancer), CAM use can no longer be regarded as an \"alternative\" or unusual approach to managing breast cancer. The increasing popularity of CAM increases the urgency for research into the safety and efficacy of these products and therapies. Authors' Contributions HB and SZ conceived and designed the study. HB organized and supervised data collection and inputting; drafted the paper and approved the final version. SZ organized and supervised the data analysis, provided critical comments on various drafts of the paper and approved the final version. SO helped to develop and pre-test the survey instrument, helped to organize data collection, commented on drafts of the paper and approved the final version. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
