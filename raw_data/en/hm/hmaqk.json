Alive Wellness Alive Wellness champions the ancient practice of acupuncture, a cornerstone of traditional Chinese medicine with roots dating back over 5,000 years. Acupuncture is founded on the principle that all living beings house a vital energy known as Qi, flowing through invisible channels, or meridians, within our bodies. When Qi becomes obstructed due to environmental or situational factors, it disrupts our natural harmony, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, restless sleep, or persistent discomfort. At Alive Wellness, skilled practitioners use fine needles to stimulate specific acupuncture points along these meridians. This gentle process clears blockages and restores balance, promoting healing and enhancing overall well-being. It's not just about treating symptoms, but about boosting your body's innate ability to function optimally.
