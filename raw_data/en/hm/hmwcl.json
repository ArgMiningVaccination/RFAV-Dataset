Host direct therapies can help cure or prevent deep tissue foci of antibiotic-resistant pathogens with minimal collateral damage on our microbiota. Theoretical concerns exist regarding the pro-inflammatory consequences of immune activating therapy, however uncontrolled antibiotic-resistant infections themselves cause severe deleterious inflammatory effects on the host until effective medical cure is achieved, and that wise host immune pathway targeting can overcome such hurdles.
