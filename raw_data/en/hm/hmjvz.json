Because this and other polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines were found to induce a relatively poor immune response in children younger than two years and not able to elicit long-term immunologic memory, their use was limited to persons 2 years of age and older. | |July 1, 1981 ||The costs of pneumococcal vaccine and its administration became a covered benefit under Medicare Part B. | |May 8, 1980 ||The World Health Assembly certified the world free of naturally-occurring smallpox. | |1980 ||Rabies human diploid-cell vaccine (Imovax Rabies diploid fibroblast) strain of rubella vaccine (Meruvax II by Merck) was licensed; all other strains were discontinued. | |1979 ||The last cases of wild type 1 poliovirus occurred in the U.S. among unvaccinated Amish persons and members of other religious groups who did not accept vaccination. The source of the outbreak was determined to have been brought over to the U.S. from the Netherlands by members of an unvaccinated religious group. | |Jan 3, 1978 ||Yellow fever vaccine (YF-Vax by Connaught) was licensed in the U.S. | |Jan 3, 1978 ||Monovalent group A (Menomune-A by Connaught), group C (Menomune-C by Connaught) meningococcal vaccines, and a bivalent vaccine for both groups A and C (Menomune-A/C by Connaught) were licensed. | |Nov 21, 1977 ||The first pneumococcal vaccine was licensed, containing 14 serotypes (of the 83 known serological groups) that comprised 80% of all bacteremic pneumococcal infections in the U.S. | |Oct 26, 1977 ||The last case of naturally-acquired smallpox occurred in the Merca District of Somalia. | |1977 ||Joseph A. Califano, Jr., Secretary of the Dept of Health, Education, and Welfare (later Health and Human Services) launched the National Childhood Immunization Initiative with a goal of achieving 90% vaccination levels among all children. | |1976 ||The age for routine vaccination with MMR vaccine was changed from 12 months to 15 months. | |Apr 2, 1974 ||The first monovalent (group C) meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Merck) was licensed. | |1974 ||The Expanded Programme on Immunization was created within WHO, in response to poor immunization levels in developing countries (less than 5% of children in 1974). The following vaccines are used by the Expanded Programme on Immunization: BCG, polio, DTP, measles (often MMR), yellow fever (in endemic countries), and hepatitis B. | |July 18, 1973 ||Measles and mumps virus vaccine, live (M-M-Vax by Merck) was licensed. | |1972 ||The Division of Biologics Standards was transferred from NIH to FDA and renamed the Bureau of Biologics. It was responsible for the regulation of all biologics, including serums, vaccines, and blood products. | |Apr 22, 1971 ||Combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR by Merck) as well as combined measles and rubella vaccine (M-R-Vax by Merck) were licensed; the vaccine was developed by Maurice Hilleman and colleagues at Merck. | |1971 ||CDC recommended discontinuation of routine vaccination for smallpox in the U.S. following a greatly reduced risk of disease. | |1969 ||Three rubella virus strains were licensed in the U.S.: strain grown in dog-kidney culture (Rubelogen in duck-embryo grown culture (Cendevax by RIT-SKF, and Lirubel and | |1968 - 1969 ||The \"Hong Kong\" influenza pandemic, caused by an H3N2 influenza virus, resulted in roughly 34,000 deaths in the U.S. | |1968 ||A second live, further attenuated measles virus vaccine (Attenuvax by Merck, based on the Moraten strain, derived from the Edmonston strain) was licensed. | |1967 ||The Global Smallpox Eradication Program was launched by WHO. During the first year of the program, 44 countries, 31 of which had endemic smallpox, reported 217,218 cases. | |Dec 28, 1967 ||Mumps virus vaccine live (MumpsVax by Merck) was licensed. The vaccine was developed by Maurice Hilleman who isolated a wild type virus from his daughter, Jeryl Lynn, who was recovering from mumps. It became known as the Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus. | |1966 ||The World Health Assembly called for global smallpox eradication. | |1966 ||CDC announced the first national measles eradication campaign. Within 2 years, measles incidence had decreased by more than 90% compared with prevaccine-era levels. | |1966 ||The rubella virus was attenuated by Paul Parkman and Harry Meyer, Jr. | |1965 ||Bifurcated needle for smallpox vaccine introduced | |1965 ||Live, further attenuated measles virus vaccine (Lirugen by Pitman Moore-Dow based on the Schwarz strain, derived from the Edmonston strain) was licensed in the U.S. The recommended age for routine administration was changed from 9 to 12 months of age. | |1964 ||A rubella epidemic swept the U.S. resulting in 12.5 million cases of rubella infection, an estimated 20,000 newborns with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), and excess fetal and neonatal deaths in the thousands. | |1964 ||The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) to the U.S. Public Health Service was formed to review the recommended childhood immunization schedule and note changes in manufacturers' vaccine formulations, revise recommendations for the use of licensed vaccines, and make recommendations for newly licensed vaccines. | |June 25, 1963 ||Trivalent oral polio vaccine was licensed. The vaccine development began in 1957 by Albert Sabin to improve upon the killed Salk vaccine. | |1963 ||The Federal Immunization Grant Program was established. The grants, authorized under section 317 of the Public Health Service Act, were made to states to provide funds to purchase vaccines and to support basic functions of an immunization program. The only vaccines available at the time were DTP, polio, and smallpox. | |Mar 21, 1963 ||The first live virus measles vaccine (Rubeovax by Merck) was licensed. Other live virus measles vaccines were eventually licensed (M-Vac by Lederle, Pfizer-vax Measles-L by Pfizer, and generic vaccines by Lilly, Parke Davis, and Philips Roxane). | |1963 ||Inactivated measles vaccine (Pfizer-vax Measles-K by Pfizer and a generic vaccine by Lilly) were licensed in the U.S. These vaccines were eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1967. | |1962 ||President John F. Kennedy signed the the Vaccination Assistance Act into law. It allowed the CDC to support mass immunization campaigns and to initiate maintenance programs. | |Mar 27, 1962 ||Oral polio vaccine type 3 was licensed in the U.S., as well as the trivalent product. | |1961 ||Oral polio vaccine types 1 and 2, developed by Dr. Albert Sabin and grown in monkey kidney cell culture, were licensed for use in the U.S. | |1957 - 1958 ||The \"Asian\" influenza pandemic, caused by an H2N2 influenza virus, resulted in an estimated 70,000 deaths in the U.S. alone. | |1955 ||The Polio Vaccination Assistance Act was enacted by Congress, the first federal involvement in immunization activities. It allowed Congress to appropriate funds to the Communicable Disease Center (later the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to help states and local communities acquire and administer vaccine. | |1955 ||The Cutter polio vaccine incident began on April 25, 1955, when polio was reported in a vaccine recipient. One day later, five more cases were reported. All cases had received vaccine produced by Cutter Laboratories. Polio was reported in 94 vaccinees and in 166 close contacts of vaccinees. On April 27, the Laboratory of Biologics Control requested that Cutter Laboratories recall all vaccine and the company did so immediately. On May 7, the Surgeon General recommended that all polio vaccinations be suspended pending inspection of each manufacturing facility and thorough review of the procedures for testing vaccine safety. The investigation found that live polio virus had survived in two batches of vaccine produced by Cutter Laboratories. In 1955, as a result of the Cutter Incident, the Laboratory of Biologics Control was raised to division status within NIH, to strengthen and expand its biologics control function. Large-scale polio vaccinations resumed in the fall of 1955. | |Apr 12, 1955 ||The first polio vaccine was licensed -- an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) pioneered by Dr. Jonas Salk. | |1954 ||The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to John Enders, Thomas Weller, and Fredrick Robbins for their discovery of the ability of poliomyelitis viruses to grow in tissue cultures. | |1954 ||John Enders and Thomas Peebles isolated the measles virus in cell culture. | |1953 ||Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (adult formulation) was first licensed in the U.S., after the concentration of diphtheria toxoid was reduced. | |May 22, 1953 ||Yellow fever vaccine (Merrell National Labs) was first licensed in the U.S. | |July 16, 1952 ||Heat-phenol inactivated typhoid vaccine by Wyeth was licensed. | |1952 ||The worst recorded polio epidemic in U.S. history occurred with 57,628 reported cases | |1949 ||Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP) was licensed. | |1949 ||The last case of smallpox in the U.S. was reported; however, it took another two decades before the disease was eradicated globally. | |1947 || Combination diphtheria and tetanus toxoids for pediatric use was first licensed in the U.S. | |1945 ||Inactivated influenza vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. | |1945 ||K Habel and John Enders isolated the mumps virus. | |1944 ||The Public Health Services Act of 1944 was enacted, consolidating all legislation affecting the functions of the Public Health Service. | |1943 ||Penicillin first became mass-produced. This medical miracle, rediscovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, was capable of attacking many types of disease-causing bacteria. It played a vital role in treating infected wounds during World War II. | |1942 ||Influenza A/B vaccine was introduced to the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board. The influenza vaccine was licensed in 1945 and, following the war, was also used for civilians. | |1942 ||Hepatitis A and B viruses were first differentiated. | |1938 ||President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a victim of polio, founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, later known as the March of Dimes. | |1937 ||An adsorbed form of tetanus toxoid was first licensed in the U.S. | |1937 ||The Division of Biologics Control was formed within the National Institute of Health. Much later, in 1972, the Division was transferred to the FDA. | |1935 ||A live yellow fever vaccine (17D) was first licensed. The development of the chorioallantoic membrane for culturing viruses had led to its development. | |1930 ||The Hygienic Laboratory changed its name to the National Institute (singular) of Health and authorized the establishment of fellowships for biological and medical research. | |1930 ||Cell culture was developed and shown to be able to grow virus, thus paving the way for the subsequent production of viral vaccines. | |1928 ||The first iron lung was used to preserve breathing function in patients with acute polio. | |1927 ||Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine was first used in newborns, having been developed by Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9\u00e9rin in 1921. BCG (live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG) represented the only vaccine against tuberculosis. It has become the most widely administered of all vaccines in the WHO Expanded Programme for Immunization, but has been estimated to prevent only 5% of all potentially vaccine-preventable deaths due to tuberculosis. | |1923 ||Diphtheria toxoid was licensed; prepared from the inactivated bacterial toxin that has lost its toxicity but retains its antitoxin producing properties. In 1924, Gaston Ramon discovered diphtheria toxoid. Along with the discovery of antitoxins, Ramon uncovered the role of adjuvant substances of immunity. | |1918 ||The \"Spanish flu\" influenza pandemic was responsible for at least 50 million deaths worldwide, with about 675,000 deaths in the U.S. This virus was unusual because it spread so quickly, was so deadly, and exacted its worse toll among the young and healthy. About one-third of the world's population (~500 million people) were infected. | |1915 ||Pertussis vaccine, a suspension of inactivated Bordetella pertussis cells, was licensed. Inactivated vaccines were prepared with a microorganism or virus that had been killed, usually with a chemical such as formaldehyde. | |1914 ||Typhoid vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. | |1914 ||Rabies vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. | |1914 ||Tetanus toxoid was introduced following the development of an effective therapeutic serum against tetanus by Emil Von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato. | |1908 ||The first county health departments in the U.S. were formed. | |1906 ||The Pure Food and Drugs Act was formed, prohibiting interstate commerce in misbranded and adulterated foods, drinks, and drugs. | |April 5, 1902 ||The Biologics Control Act was formed. It included the regulation of vaccine and antitoxin producers and required both licensing and inspections of manufacturers. The standards imposed by the 1902 Act resulted in bankruptcy for one-third of the companies manufacturing antitoxins and vaccines while benefiting the manufacturers already in compliance. Ten firms held licenses with the Laboratory of Hygiene following the 1902 Act. | |1901 ||In St. Louis, 13 children died of tetanus-contaminated diphtheria antitoxin. In the autumn of 1901, nine children in Camden, New Jersey, died from tainted smallpox vaccine. Efforts to ensure the purity of biological treatments by government oversight followed with the Biologics Control Act of 1902. | |1901 ||The first Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine was awarded to Emil von Behring for his work on the development of a diphtheria antitoxin (later known as antiserum). | |1897 ||Plague vaccine was introduced, following the preparation of anti-plague horse serum at the Pasteur Institute by Alexandre Yersin. After demonstrating protection from disease in immunized animals, Yersin went to China with the vaccine to protect humans during a plague epidemic. | |1896 ||Cholera and typhoid vaccines were first developed. | |1893 ||City and state public health departments began mass production of diphtheria antitoxin, following its introduction in European laboratories. | |1888 ||The Pasteur Institute was established as a rabies treatment center as well as an infectious diseases research and training institute. | |1888 ||The diphtheria toxin was discovered by Emile Roux. Passive serum therapies were developed through the scientific contributions of many, including Emil Von Behring who developed the first effective therapeutic serum against diphtheria and Paul Ehrlich who developed enrichment and standardization protocol, which allowed for an exact determination of quality of the diphtheria antitoxins. | |1887 ||Joseph Kinyoun established one of the country's first bacteriological laboratories in the Marine Health Service Hospital on Staten Island, NY. He was director of the Laboratory of Hygiene, which moved to Washington, D.C., in 1891. Kinyoun brought the latest techniques such as the procedure for preparing diphtheria antitoxin back from his visits to Europe. | |1885 ||Louis Pasteur first used rabies vaccine in humans. | |1884 ||The first live attenuated viral vaccine (rabies) was developed by Louis Pasteur, using dessicated brain tissue inactivated with formaldehyde. | |1882 ||Robert Koch identified the tubercle bacillus as the cause of tuberculosis, subsequently called Koch's bacillus. | |1881 ||Louis Pasteur and George Miller Sternberg almost simultaneously isolated and grew the pneumococcus organism. | |1879 ||Louis Pasteur created the first bacterial vaccine (chicken cholera) | |1877 ||Louis Pasteur proposed The Germ Theory of Disease. | |1798 ||Edward Jenner published his work on the development of a vaccination that would protect against smallpox. Two years earlier, in 1796, he had first speculated that protection from smallpox disease could be obtained through inoculation with a related virus, vaccinia or cowpox. He tested his theory by inoculating eight-year-old James Phipps with cowpox pustule liquid recovered from the hand of a milkmaid, Sarah Nelmes. | |1798 ||The Marine Health Service was established in 1798 as the nation's first public health agency. It provided hospital care for merchant seamen and protected port cities against diseases such as smallpox, cholera, and yellow fever. | |1721 ||Variolation was introduced to Great Britain. | |1100s ||The variolation technique was developed, involving the inoculation of children and adults with dried scab material recovered from smallpox patients. Variations of variolation have been noted in Turkey, Africa, China, and Europe. | |400 BC ||Hippocrates described mumps, diphtheria, epidemic jaundice, and other conditions | "}
