Spine Care Team Includes Multiple Specialties Our multidisciplinary spine team works to determine the right treatment for each patient, beginning with the least invasive option. We consider the patient's medical profile to recommend the best provider and treatment plan, and offer access to specialists in multiple areas. Complete Evaluation and Personalized Treatment Plan Each patient is evaluated with a comprehensive diagnostic process that enables us to best determine the cause of your symptoms. We will then create a personalized plan that incorporates the full spectrum of non-operative and operative treatment options. Non-Operative Care Our anesthesia pain medicine specialists use evidence-based techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of spine pain. These range from pharmacologic and interventional management in the form of injections and ablative therapy as well as neuromodulation to treat nerve pain. We also offer a non-pharmaceutical program that features alternative techniques for pain management, including integrative medicine, healing touch, acupuncture and yoga. Our certified physical medicine & rehabilitation (PM&R) specialists work with patients using conservative rehabilitation strategies and management techniques such as injections or ablative therapy to help alleviate pain. Treatment can be as diverse as addressing other musculoskeletal problems impacting spine pain (e.g., shoulder, hip or knee problems), considering biomechanical stressors that impact the patient at work or play and maximizing patient fitness and resilience to injury.
