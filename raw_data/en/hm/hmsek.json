HPV 16 & 18 together cause 70% of cervical cancer, a disease that kills about 250,000 women each year worldwide. GlaxoSmithKline reported out - standing results for its vaccine Cer - varix in November 2004. In May 2005, Merck reported similar results for its vaccine Gardasil. The Merck version is now on the market in many countries of the world, while Cervarix awaits ap - proval in both Europe and the US. Initial results showed 100% protec - tion against infection in uninfected girls and women. Some health professionals talked of the virtual elimination of cervi - cal cancer. In October 2005, Kevin Ault, a gynaecologist on the Merck research panel, told CNN television news: \"We are talking about maybe a generation or The new HPV vaccines have shown impressive results in their target population, but if immunisation programmes come at the expense of existing or planned cytological screening, deaths from cervical cancer may increase. two of women to receive this vaccine be - fore we get to no more Pap smears.\" The vaccines still show strong pro - tection against target HPV types in girls and women who are free of the virus. However, it is becoming clear that they are nowhere near as effective at stop - ping cervical cancer in the real world where infection rates are high. More- over, the cost of Gardasil, $360 in the US and \u20ac300 in Europe for a three-dose course, raises fears that money could be diverted from screening programmes. Merck and its European partner Sanofi Pasteur MSD have been ac - cused of over-aggressive marketing. In the US, Merck called off its lobbying of state authorities after questions were raised over some of the claims being made on behalf of the vaccine and after it was revealed that Merck had made payments to the group coordinating ef - forts to win State legislation for school vaccination programmes. In Europe, the First Global Sum - mit on Cervical Cancer, held in Paris in March 2007, attracted criticism for its reliance on Sanofi Pasteur. The British newspaper, The Guardian , revealed that Sanofi Pasteur had funded the whole event, paid for sports stars to attend and even paid some freelance journalists to cover it. It also published a claim that consultants had been offered money to attend meetings as 'opinion leaders'. The Summit, held under the pa - tronage of the French President Jacques Chirac, called on governments to \"ed - ucate and communicate to all women worldwide about cervical cancer - its cause and prevention through vaccina - tion and regular cervical cancer screen - ing.\" Justine Henin, the Belgian tennis star, said she would campaign to raise awareness about HPV and the need for screening and \"to urge governments that mothers should be able to protect their daughters with a vaccine.\" efficacy in the real world The striking performance of Gardasil in its primary target group and the DrugWatch CanCer world n july/august 2007 n 27relative lack of impact in a wider pop - ulation of women is seen in the lat - est results from the FUTURE study group, published in the New England Journal of Medicine (10 May 2007). These extend the phase III study re - sults of Gardasil to three years, up to 15 June 2006. In the Merck-sponsored study, more than 12,000 women aged 15-26 were randomised to receive Gardasil or placebo. After three years, vaccine ef - ficacy against pre-cancerous high-grade cervical lesions (CIN 2 & 3) caused by HPV types 16&18 was 98% amongst uninfected girls and women. The study says: \"These findings suggest that wide - spread immunisation of female adoles - cents and young women could lead to reductions in HPV-16-related and HPV-18-related high-grade lesions that would be apparent within years, rather than decades.\" However, there was no clear evi - dence that vaccination altered the course of existing HPV infection. Ef - ficacy drops to 44% in the \"intention to treat population\" - defined as all women regardless of their HPV status at the start of the trial. In this wider population, 83 women in the vaccine group developed high-grade cervical disease related to HPV 16 or 18, against 148 in the placebo group. When all high-grade cervical le - sions are taken into account, efficacy drops to just 17%: cervical disease re - lated to any HPV type (not just 16&18) was found in 219 women in the vaccine group and 266 in the placebo group. There were parallel results in a separate study of the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing anogenital disease (geni - tal warts or vulvar or vaginal intraepi - thelial neoplasia). It can be seen that the impact of introducing the vaccine is highly signifi - cant in uninfected girls and women, but far smaller in the general population. Vaccine manufacturers argue that the vaccine is prophylactic, not thera - peutic, and is not supposed to protect women who are already infected. That is the very reason for targeting vaccination programmes on girls before sexual activ - ity begins. Many specialists welcome the vaccine as an extra weapon and some believe that a vaccine programme could even sharpen the focus on screening. However, they do not want the vaccine to undermine attempts to strengthen screening programmes. Poland - five die each day Poland has one of the highest cervical cancer rates in Europe, with up to 4,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer a year. Half of these women currently die, at a rate of five women a day. Slawomir Majewski, President of the Polish Society for HPV Prevention, said, \"The main reason is late diagnosis. We never had a good screening programme.\" He cites as contributory factors lack of education at school about sexually trans - mitted diseases, stigma attached to going for gynaecological examination, and the poor state of the economy . In 2006, Poland introduced a na - tional cervical screening programme, inviting five million women a year for screening. In June 2006, the vaccine (called SILGARD in central and east - ern Europe) was approved for use in Prevention is better than cure. For greatest preventive effect, immunisation programmes need to vaccinate young people before they become sexually active When all high-grade cervical lesions are taken into account, efficacy drops to just 17%Poland, and several local authorities have since decided to fund vaccina - tion for girls in local schools. The Polish Society for HPV Preven - tion, formed by gynaecologists, vaccinolo - gists, paediatricians, general practitioners and specialists in sexually transmitted in - fections, has organised training for 5,000 doctors over the past two years. There has been a mass media campaign to raise awareness in the public (details can be seen in Polish at www.hpv .pl). Merck was involved in funding and planning some of this work as was GlaxoSmithKline, but Majewski says that they did not put doc - tors under pressure. \"Before the vaccine was approved, Merck supported a very good educa - tional campaign speaking only about the HPV problem and cytology and so on. So they were very clever and then when the vaccine was approved and was on the market, they just added this information. \"From a medical and scientific point of view, we were not put under pressure. In Poland, it was necessary to start to talk about this problem. Of course, these companies always think about business, but the most important thing is to be fair, to tell the truth and not exaggerate and to be objective. \"I would say we have made a huge effort in Poland. We have definitely shifted public opinion and provoked huge discussions. We have done a very good job, for doctors, general society and policy makers and also for general authorities.\" He said that vaccine and screen - ing programmes could strengthen each other. \"I am sure that many more DrugWatch 28 n CanCer world n july/august 2007So long as HPV virus continues to exist in the population, so will the need for screening Gardasil The Merck vaccine Gardasil (also marketed as SILGARD) protects against HPV types 6,11, 16 & 18.

Almost 85% of the sexually active population aged be - tween 18 and 45 is HPV negative.\" Serbia - Screening iS a Priority Serbia has an even higher rate of cer - vical cancer, one that has risen over two decades. In 2002, the national rate was 27.2 per 100,000 women (1,089 new cases), with regional rates as high as 38.1 women per 100,000. Similar rates are seen in Romania, Albania and Bosnia & Herzegovina. At 7.2 deaths per 100,000 women, mortality in Serbia is not as high as in some other countries due to better treatment, but cervical cancer cost 452 women their lives in 2002. Serbia has never had a national strategy for cancer prevention or cen - tralised screening. The Balkan conflict and subsequent economic collapse eroded what opportunistic screening there was, as health spending fell from \u20ac150 per person in 1997 to less than \u20ac 50 in 1999. In 2003, the Ministry of Health appointed an expert group for the pre -vention and early detection of cervical cancer. A survey sponsored by the Al - liance for Cervical Cancer Prevention (ACCP) identified lack of knowledge, embarrassment, a sense of fatalism about cancer and unwillingness to talk about the disease as barriers to screen - ing, as well as lack of patient-friendly health services. In 2004, a WHO pilot programme - funded by the French Government - was launched in Branicevo in eastern Serbia. This screened 12,763 women aged 30-49, almost 60% of the target population. high-grade mous intraepithelial lesions and six inva - sive cancers were detected - a cervical cancer incidence of 47 per 100,000.

Meanwhile the vaccine was ap - proved for use in Serbia in October 2006, although it is not yet on the market. Vesna Kesi , professor of gynaeco - logical oncology at the Clinical Centre of Serbia in Belgrade, is the Ministry of Health adviser for the prevention and detection of cervical cancer, and has been centrally involved in the efforts to introduce screening. She describes the vaccine study results as encouraging and fascinating. However, she says, \"At present, the HPV vaccination would be a great opportunity and benefit in areas of the world where cervical screening is not available or feasible. The imple - mentation of a nationwide screening programme in a country like Serbia is a realistic goal, can be achieved and will remain pivotal in the prevention of cer - vical cancer. We cannot forget women who already have cervical cancer and do not know it, and the women who have pre-cancer that should be treated. \"I do not mean that vaccination should not be started as well, but in these economic circumstances, it cannot be made available on a national scale. For me, it is hard to imagine that a low-re - source country should concentrate ef - forts and financial resources on trying to implement compulsory vaccination just when it is about to provide and pay for the regular, organised screening for its wom - en that has been fought for so hard.\" low-income countrie S The International Union Against Cancer (UICC) has a global vision to eliminate cervical cancer, but notes that 83% of cervical cancers occur in resource-constrained countries, with high mortality rates, in sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America and some regions of Southeast Asia. Few ef - fective screening programmes exist in these countries. The UICC says that screening pro - grammes remain important, but early vaccination prior to the onset of sexual activity will be \"of primary importance\" in under-screened populations. To achieve this, the cost of vaccinations in these countries will have to come down. Virologist Harald zur Hausen, who first identified HPV as the viral cause of cervical cancer, has helped the UICC to draft a new position statement. He told CancerWorld , \"I think screening must continue, as the vaccines only cover 70% of the cervical cancer cases. However, in countries with no screening facilities and no gynaecological tests, the vaccine needs to be introduced so that it is avail - able prior to the onset of sexual activity . The message from the NEJM papers is that women who are not already infected are highly protected.\" a twin-track aPProach So long as HPV virus continues to ex - ist in the population, so will the need for screening. Whether Pap smears become unnecessary in a generation or two depends on a number of variables, including vaccination levels in the tar - get group, the longevity of vaccine pro - tection, the extent to which the virus lives on in men, the effect of HPV types not covered by the vaccine and factors such as population movements. Will a country that does not have the infrastructure or money to implement and maintain a cervical screening pro - gramme be able to maintain vaccina - tion at or near 100%, especially if there is opposition to giving this vaccine to adolescent girls? A vaccine programme has its own organisational problems, such as the need for an up-to-date vaccination registry, for revaccination, for regular follow-up of vaccinated girls and for continued screening for the 30% of problems caused by HPV types not covered by the vaccine. Fur - ther surveillance is also needed to investigate long-term safety; reports of fainting, numbness and rare cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occurred during the Gardasil trial. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foun - dation has funded the Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention to work with low-income countries on a strat - egy to combat cervical cancer. The ACC P and GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunisation) are talking to the drug companies about ways to make vaccines affordable to developing countries. So far there are no firm proposals. It seems unthinkable that any coun - try with an advanced healthcare system will want to abandon cervical screening in the foreseeable future. Indeed many countries now need to strengthen their national programmes. Countries with little or no cervical screening need something that is affordable and that works. At present, the vaccine is not af - fordable. It has great potential to save life - but only if adds to existing protec - tion, rather than weakening it. Vaccination before onset of sexual activity will be 'of primary importance' in under-screened populations "}
