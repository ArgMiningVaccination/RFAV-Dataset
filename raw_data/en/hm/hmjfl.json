Introduction Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Asse ssment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 2 1. INTRODUCTION This document is a n Environmenta l and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the \" Study for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi \" in the Western Province of Zambia. This ESIA was written by BRLi and NIRAS by the following experts: Eric Deneut (BRLi) : ESIA montage, Environmental baseline and impact assessment , Project description. Charles Kapekele Chileya (NIRAS) : Social baseline and impact assessment. Christophe Nativel (BRLi) : support in social baseline report. Gordon Mudenda (NIRAS): Fish baseline and impact assessment . The priority traditional canals are (see map next page ): Muoyowamo canal (further in the study the Nami tome, a natural tributary of the Muoyowamo was added to the study ); Lubitamei canal (also called \"Nangula canal\" on its eastern part (from Ndiki to Kate) and \"Nonge canal\" on the western part (from Kate to its end in the Mongu / Kalabo waterway) ; N'gombala canal (f urther in the study this canal was divided in N'gombala and Nebubela); Fisheries canal ; Musiamo canal. The Study for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi has proposed activities to restore canals , these activities are described as the \"Project\" in this report. These activities were developed in a participative manner, involving local population and stakeholders' participation through social surveys and workshops. Stakeholder and location populatio n opinion are incorporated in the restoration/rehabilitation work . The aim of the ESIA is to study sociological, economic and cultural baseline components as well as environmental components and to analyze the impacts brought by the proposed Project on the se components . This ESIA allows for the development of mitigation measures to ensure that all activities impacts are avoided, mitigated or compensated. 1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE PRO JECT The Government of the Republic of Zambia has been allocated grant funds from the Climate Investment Funds (CIF ) that are administered by the World Bank and African Development Bank and executed by the Zambian Ministry of Transport, Works, Supply and Communications. The CIF include four key programs that help developing countries i n implementing low -emissions and climate resilient programs: Clean Technology Fund (CTF); Forest Investment Program (FIP); Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP); Pilot Program Climate Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in th e Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 3 It is under the PPCR that the Study takes pla ce. The PPCR is implemented through a partnership of five Multi -lateral Development Banks: African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Inter - American Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank Group (WBG ). The World Bank is the Trustee for the CIF and hosts the CIF Administrative Unit The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) is lead by the Ministry of Finance. It is divided in two phases; Phase I (2010 to 2013) was a preparatory phase focusing on: Mainstreaming climate resilience into national development planning; Strengthened institutional coordination ; Improved information for decision makers ; Targeted awareness of communication ; Preparation of phase II . Phase II is composed of two investme nt projects: The first one is entitled \"Strengthening Climate Resilience in the Barotse sub Basin\". It is funded by the World Bank and will last from 2013 to 2019. The Detailed Assessment, Conceptual Design and Environmental and Social Impact Assessment ( ESIA) Study for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi is part of this Phase. The second one, entitled \"Strengthening Climate Resilience in the Kafue Sub -basin\" is funded by the African Development Bank and will last from 2013 to 2018. The following graph summarizes the Study background. 1.

Introduction Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 6 1.2 SUMMARY DESCRIPTION O F THE PROJECT INCLUD ING PROJECT RATIONALE 1.2.1 Project rationale The canals network is presently suffering from malfunction due to poor maintenance resu lting in major siltation, banks degradation and progressive loss of canal trajectories. This situation prevents population from using them at their full potential (mainly navigation and agriculture), which causes economic losses. With climate change, the i ncidence of floods and droughts in this sub -basin is higher, which worsen the already threaten ed traditional canal systems, forestry and fishing resources. The intensification of both dry and rainy seasons may affect crop (particularly the anticipated flas h floods) and livestock production . These situation s highlight multiple challenges: Technical: canals undergo major constraints during floods as parts of their reaches are below water level, which lead to recurrent sand remobilisation and damages along the canal banks and beds; Management: the main challenge is to achieve financially feasible management for the canals while relying on the existing stakeholders; Socio -cultural: improving activities relating to the network and the derived livelihoods, while maintaining the cultural heritage such as the Kuomboka ceremony; Environmental: safeguarding the fragile equilibrium between anthropogenic activities and functioning ecosystems such as wetlands On the other hand, i t appears that improved canals will enhanc e economic activities and livelihoods ; the opportunity of operational canals with enhanced uses may also influence the local demography . The population, who fled the area during the last decades, may be interested in coming back and restart farming their a bandoned land. In the meantime , this could negatively impact the plain both environmentaly and culturally since the site is a candidate for World Cultural Heritage Site title and include highly valuable wetlands. 1.2.2 Summary description of works MUOYOWAMO The rehabilitation works proposed for Muoyowamo canal consist in the re -excavation of the canal, construction of two sluices and one sand trap. NAMITOME The proposed rehabilitation works of Namitome consist of the re -excavation of the canal and removal of bund s. The works only consists of earthworks. LUBITAMEI It is proposed to rehabilitate the Lubitamei canal by re -excavating it and building 2 sand traps, 3 Water Control Structures and one road crossing structure. N'GOMBALA Proposed rehabilitation or upgrading works for N'gombala consist in the re -excavation and opening of the canal. Only earthworks are Introduction -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 7 NEBUBELA The proposed rehabilitation works of the Nebubela canal consist in a re -excavation of the canal and removal of the sand banks. In addition a provision has been made for the removal of 15,000 m3 of old spoil banks. FISHERIES The proposed rehabilitation works of Fisheries canal consist in the excavation and deepening of the canal in order to allow navigation with motor boats throughout the year i n between Namushakende harbour and the Zambezi. The works are hence limited to earthworks. MUSIAMO The proposed rehabilitation works of Musiamo consist in a re -excavation and the construction of 5 road crossing structures and 7 Water Control Structures. SILTING BASINS It is proposed to build 7 silting basins which area temporary structures. Those will facilitate the dredging of the sand banks generated each year at the junction of the canals and rivers. 1.3 OBJECTIVES THE PROJEC T The goal of the Project is to enhance human activities enabled by the canals systems, in a perspective of improving their resilience to climate change. In order to achieve this goal, a sustainable Canals Management Plan accompanied by the corresponding detailed design required for thei r restoration will be developed. Core preoccupations is to satisfy on the long term the human activities needs, in the respect of the fragile environment equilibrium of the Barotse RAMSAR Area and the socio -cultural background . In that purpose, the project result s in a multi -disciplinary approach, that integrate s: The human framework, through the proposal of a Canals Management Plan that satisfies water uses anticipating the impacts of climate change, through the proposal of canals management evolution towa rds sustainability, and respecting the socio -cultural setting; The ecosystem constraints/requirements, recognizing the links that it may have with the historical human use of water and population livelihoods. The infrastructure rehabilitation and moderniza tion to answer the needs for technical evolution highlighted by the plan. The present study is an ambitious program whose level of complexity and innovation derives from a strategy that seeks collaboration and draws on the combined efforts of separate but inter-linked sectors - environment, natural resources management, agriculture, rural development, enterprise development and finance. In the framework of the Project, BRLi/NIRAS Assignment is to produce: Technical reports: Detailed conceptual design for canals management and rehabilitation (Assessment Report); Operation and Maintenance Program ; Bidding document (Procurement of Rehabilitation works of priority Barotse canals); 1.

As required in the Environmen tal Protection and Pollution Control (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1997, Regulations 9 (3), A Scoping report is a legal prerequisite to the ESIA and was produced and handed to ZEMA in 2013. 1.3.1 Objectives of the Assignment The objective of th e assignment is to assess how use of the targeted canals in the Barotse sub -basin can be strengthened to optimize their role in supporting the local population to become more climate resilient, taking into account the prevailing socio -cultural and environm ental context . The assignment is divided in three major parts: Technical reports: Detailed conceptual design for canals management and rehabilitation (Assessment Report); Operation and Maintenance Program ; Bidding document (Procurement of Rehabilitation works of priority Barotse canals); Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). This report constitutes the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment. It was written by: Eric Deneut (BRLi) : ESIA montage, Environmental baseline and assessment , Project description . Charles Kapekele Chileya (NIRAS) : Social baseline and impact assessment. Christophe Nativel (BRLi) : support in social baseline report. Gordon Mudenda (NIRAS): Fish baseline and impact assessment. 1.3.2 Objective of the ESIA The aim of the E SIA is to study sociological, economic and cultural baseline component s as well as environmental components and to analyze the impacts brought by the Project on these components. Based on baseline and impact assessment, the ESIA proposes mitigation measure s as well as compensation measures. Moreover, an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) is annexed to this ESIA to ensure proper implementation of measures. These measures, when necessary, influence the Conceptual Design. 1.

Introduction Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 10 \"Category B: A proposed project is classified as Category B if its potential adverse environmental impacts on huma n populations or environmentally important areas --including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural habitats --are less adverse than those of Category A projects. These impacts are site -specific; few if any of them are irreversible; and in most cas es mitigatory measures can be designed more readily than for Category A projects. The scope of Environmental Assessment for a Category B project may vary from project to project, but it is narrower than that of Category A Environmental Assessment. Like Cat egory A Environmental Assessment, it examines the project's potential negative and positive environmental impacts and recommends any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance \". Terms of reference to this study are in annex 11. 1.4 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE LOCATION The Barotse is Zambia's second largest wetland. It is located in the Western Province, 600 km west of Lusaka. The main city within the Barotse is Mongu municipality . The Za mbezi River crosses the area from North to South. The sub -basin is fed by high annual rainfall of up 1400 mm. As the area is very flat, the Zambezi water floods the plain 3 to 5 months per year, from January to June. The Lozi people are the inhabitants of the Barotse, and derive diverse livelihoods from the floodplain. The traditional authority of the area is the \"Barotse Royal Establishment\" (BRE). This institution is led by the king, namely the Litunga (Owner of the Land) who is assisted by the ministers called Indunas. The Barotse is famous for its cultural heritage, and in particular for the Kuomboka ceremony, when the Litunga leaves his palace of Lealui in the plain to go to his palace of Limulunga on the upper land. For its important biodiversity, the Barotse has been designated as Ramsar site since 2007. For its living culture and traditions, it has been proposed to become a Cultural Landscape site at the UNESCO World Heritage Center. 1.5 PARTICULARS OF SHAREHOLDERS /DIRECTORS This sectio n does not apply to the current Project . 1.6 PERCENTAGE OF SHAREHO LDING BY EACH SHAREH OLDER This sectio n does not apply to the current Project . 1.7 THE DEVELOPER 'S PHYSICAL ADDRESS A ND THE CONTACT PERSON AND HIS /HER DETAILS This sectio n does not apply to the current Project .

Policy, Institutional and Organisational Framework Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in t he Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 16 Table 4 World Bank Safeguard Policy Safeguard Policy Relevance for Canal maintenance Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01) This is highly rele vant as some activities in the canal m aintenance program may lead to adverse environmental impacts for example, land management activities, decimation of wild plant and animal species that affects social livelihoods. An environmental assessment is required by the Bank. Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) This is highly relevant to siting of the project. As defined by OP 4.04, Natural Habitats , Annex A , Critical Natural Habitats are: (i) existing protected areas and areas officially proposed by governments as protected areas (e.g., reserves that mee t the criteria of the World Conservation Union [IUCN] classifications) or areas initially recognized as protected by traditional local communities (e.g., sacred groves), and sites that maintain conditions vital for the viability of these protected areas ( as determined by the environmental assessment process); or (ii) sites identified on supplementary lists prepared by the Bank or an authoritative source determined by the Regional environment sector unit (RESU). Such sites may include areas recognized by t raditional local communities (e.g., sacred groves); areas with known high suitability for bio -diversity conservation; and sites that are critical for rare, vulnerable, migratory, or endangered species. Listings are based on systematic evaluations of such factors as species richness; the degree of endemism, ra rity, and vulnerability of component species; representativeness; and integrity of ecosystem processes. Pest Management (OP/ 4.09) Non-applicable. However, if future agricultural activities are planned as part of a separate mandate, p roducers on irrigate d land may use pesticides likely to harm the environment. The Bank encourages integrated pest management in its projects. In cases where chemical pesticides are used, selection and use is restricted according to specified bank criteria. Physical Cultural Resources (OPN 11.03/OP 4.11) Relevant for location of project. Location should avoid objects, buildings, either moveable or immovable, or any other entity of cultural significance such as royal burial sites . Otherwise , measures should be proposed to mitig ate adverse impacts, as part of the Environmental Assessment (EA) process. Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) Applicable, since some structures such as silting basin and sand traps will necessitate economic displacemet of population. Resettlement plann ing and implementation should be planned together with the affected communities. Forests (OP/BP 4.36) Non-applicable as there are no forestry activities in the Plain and no forest . 2. Policy, Institutional Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for t he improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 17 Safeguard Policy Relevance for Canal maintenance Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.36) Non-applicable. Projects in Disputed Areas (OP/BP/GP 7.60) Non-applicable. Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP/GP 7.50) Non-applicable. However, if future agricultural activities are planned as part of a separate mandate, this may become relevant in the case the Zambezi would be impacted ( international water body). In that case, all concerned riparian states would need to be informed about the project. The necessary agreements need to be made among them for the efficient use of the international waterway, except in a few cases as outlined u nder the policy. The Zambezi river is a shared resource and other states may have to be consulted. 2.2 ORGANISATIONAL FRAMEW ORK The Key players who are critical to in the operation and maintenance of the canals are presented in this section. The rehabilitati on, maintenance and use of the Barotse project canals involve Governmental Organization, the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE) and the local Communities. TRADITIONAL AND GOVER NMENTAL INSTITUTION The Barotse Royal Establishment ( BRE) through its networks, s tretching from the household, village (munizi) , silalanda, silalo(sub district), sikilili(district) up to the BRE Headquarters at Lealui/Limulunga and Government of Zambia through its departments at provincial, District and Sub District levels are the two key stakeholders in the restoration and maintenance of the Barotse Project canals. The following table shows the correspondance of the scales of intervention and institutions in the traditional and administrative systems. The institutional structure of the Public Sector Ministries are generally the same . In all cases, the Ministries are overseen by Ministers and Deputy Ministers. The actual day -to day running of the Ministries at the Province level is the responsibility of the Permanent Secretary (PS). The PS supervises the work of various departments within each Ministry. At the District level, a District Commissionner is involved. 2.

It draws its mandate from the Barotse agreement of 1964 that includes general traditional governance, Natural resource Management and conservation, local taxation as well as canal operation and maintenance inter alia. The BRE structure is hierarchical and has about 6 levels of gov ernance. The supreme body of the BRE is the Barotse National Council which is headed by The Litunga. The next level is the Kuta which operates as a court followed by The Ngambela /Inete or the Prime Minister. There is then the District level BRE representa tive known as the district Induna and sub district BRE representative called the Silalo Induna. Finally the Village Headman represents the BRE at village level As a totality, the BRE's activities regarding canal O&M include : Provision of guidance on canals development and maintenance policy Mobilize the community/canal users for canal maintenance Carrying out the canal maintenance of village canal We should state here that the BRE is a very important institutions which must at all costs be consulted and i nvolve in any socio -economic development of the entire Western Province. This is acknowledged even by the Central Government in Zambia. We are of the view that the BRE be a key stakeholder in the PPCR project. MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT , WORKS, SUPPLY AND COMMU NICATION (MTWSC) The Department of Maritime and Inland Waterways of the Ministry of Ministry of Transport, Works, Supply and Communication (MTWSC) has the responsibility for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of canals. In the Western Province, the Departm ent of Maritime is represented by the Harbor Master and his team. In the Western Province, 3,000 km of canals and waterways network are recorded, which includes the 660 km of canals in Mongu district. However, the Harbor Master and his team concentrate on the maintenance of the 900 km of canals and waterways which are navigable in Western Province (DDMC, 2012).For the rest of the main network (70%) meaning main canals dedicated to uses other than navigation maintenance is done by the riverine populations, u nder the supervision of to the District Disaster Management Committees (DDMC) that has been delegated this responsibility (BRLi, 2013, Harbor Master interview). The DDMC's report to the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU), which falls under the Office of the Vice President of Zambia. The secondary and tertiary canals operation and maintenance is done by the riverine populations under the supervision of the Village Headmen. The MTWSC is the Client of this project and therefor e has the highest inte rest namely policy formulation regarding Navigation, allocation of funds and staff to the harbor master and securing of equipment for canal maintenance . 2. Policy, Institutional Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 19 The Ministry is charged with the responsibility of facilitating the construction and maintenance of public infrastructure. It is also responsible for promoting the development of the transport and communication sector in order to contribute to the socio -economic development of Zambia . Further, it is responsible for the control of Government transport, office equipment and Government printing and also provides meteorological services. Under the transport portfolio, The MTWSC hosts the Department of Maritime and Inland Waterways which are mandated to manage the countries maritime and waterways which include the Barotse Canals . The MTWSC's structure has Ten (10) departments namely: Human Resources and Administration Civil Aviation Meteorology Maritime and Inland waterways Communication Transport Buildings Government printing Office equipment and maintenance serv ices Planning and monitoring The departments relevant to the canals projects are the Department of Maritime and Inland waterways and the Zambia meteorological Department. These departments receive an annual allocation of funds from the central government. The disbursements from MOF to either to the Ministry of transport HQ. Disbursements are also made through the provincial and/or administration. Drawing on the budget expenditure estimates. Through the Department of Maritime and Inland waterways, the minist ry offers Harbor/port Storage services Rehabilitation of canals including dredging Conduct patrols and enforcement of the relevant regulations Harbor rehabilitation Through the Zambia meteorological Department, the ministry provides weather and climatology information services to other key stakeholders such as the department of water affairs in the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water Development . MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK (MAL) The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock also has high interest and has a mandate to Plan and supervise Agriculture and Livestock. Their key function is the provision of agriculture -related services e.g. agriculture extension, fisheries, livestock, monitoring soil degradation and land use mapping including around the cana l areas as well as supervision of Provincial Agriculture Officer and Senior Agriculture Officer. The MAL's main responsibility is to promote farming systems which are economically viable, environmental sound with low economic risk. 2. Policy, Institutional and Organisational Framework Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 20 To realize this mandat e the Ministry has I 0 main Departments namely Human Resources and Administration Policy and planning Agriculture Department Zambia Agricultural Research Institute Veterinary Services Department Livestock Department Fisheries Department Agribusiness and Mar keting Department Co-operatives Department Veterinary and Livestock Development Research station Six of the departments are relevant to the canals projects including Agriculture, Veterinary Services, Livestock, Fisheries, Agribusiness and Marketing, Co - operatives. These departments also have representation at district level. Through the relevant departments, the ministry conducts the following typical activities : Veterinary services Livestock decrease data collection and analysis Aquaculture management an d development Fish extension services, Fish monitoring, Capture fisheries management and development Entrepreneurship development and Market research Cooperatives promotion and development, Backstopping of cooperatives, Monitoring and supervision of coope ratives Routine seed testing, seed inspections and sampling Provision of Agricultural news and literature and information dissemination through print and electronic media MINISTRY OF MINES ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT The Ministry of Mines, Energy and Wa ter Development has five departments namely Human Resource and Administration, Energy, Water Affairs, Mine Safety, Geological Survey; and Planning and Information. Of these departments, the water affairs are the most relevant department regarding the canal s project. The department of Water Affairs like many other Government departments in Zambia is organized at three different levels namely headquarters in Lusaka the country's capital, provinces and Districts. The Headquarters of the Department of Water Aff airs is based in Lusaka and has two divisions namely: Data collection and water resource planning Administration and finance 2. Policy, Institutional and Organisational Framework Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 21 At Provincial and District levels the department of Water affairs organizational structure follows the same pattern as its headquar ters but with declining authority and functions further down to the Districts and Water scheme or station levels, resulting in lack of responsibility and accountability at the lower levels. Following the water sector reforms, water supply and sanitation fu nctions have been transferred to the Ministry of Local Government and Housing, and Local authorities who have established water and sanitation, to operate these services on their behalf. Through the department of water affairs, the ministry plans and manag es water resources of the country for various sectors and users based on the (quantitative and qualitative) information collected. More relevantly to the canals project, the ministry conducts the following among others: Water resources assessments (surface and groundwater) in order to provide Adequate advice to the users on issues of potential, availability and reliability Preparation and dissemination of hydrological forecasts ; Establishment and supervision of hydrological networks ; Designing and construction of new hydrometric stations ; Training of hydrological technical staff and gauge readers DWA is also actively involved in the construction and rehabilitation of earth dam s, weirs and protection of springs. Monitoring and appraising water resources Design and construction of irrigation of works. Monitoring of surface water through more than 200 hydrometrical stations which are found through the country including the Barots e plain. MINISTRY OF LANDS NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (MLNREP) The Ministry of Lands is charged with the critical responsibility of land administration on behalf of the people of Zambia and is responsible for the following portfolio fun ctions as contained in Government Gazette Notice No. 547 of September 2004: - MLNREP has about 8 departments namely: Human Resource and Administration Lands and Deeds Lands Department Survey Department Forestry Department Environment and Natural Resources M anagement Department (ENRMD) Planning and Information Zambia Forestry College Relevant departments regarding the canals project are therefore the Forestry Department and Environment and Natural Resources Department MLNREP operates through government agenci es at local level. For the canals project, the relevant ones are forestry department and Zambia Environmental Management Agency. Throu gh the FD, the ministry conducts monitoring and regulation of forestry resources including timber, charcoal etc additional ly it conducts forest research and provides forestry extension services. 2. Policy, Institutional and Organisational Framework Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment f or the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 22 Through the ZEMA, the ministry conducts environmental pollution control, approval of various environmental assessments that precede developments. It also conducts environmental educa tion from time to time. DISASTER MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION UNIT (DMMU) The mandate of the DMMU is to manage disasters in order to minimize loss of lives, damage to property and environment through harmonization of national efforts. As disaster management a nd mitigation implies movement of relief goods and people during disasters such as floods, and that stagnant water in terms of reduced canal water flow is a precursor to malaria and other water borne diseases that are associated with disaster, the DMMU has interest in making sure the canals are maintained to enhance effective operations. The Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit is a permanently established statutory government agency, forming part of the Office of the Vice President, charged with the re sponsibility of ensuring the achievement of the nation's disaster management objectives. The National Disaster Management Structure has vertical and horizontal linkages as shown including Satellite Disaster Management Committee (SDMC). These are village l evel committees that respond to and coordinate the disaster risk reduction, mitigation and management issues. They send recommendations and collaborate with the DDMC at district level which is chaired by the DC. Since canals are key in effective functioni ng in disaster management, they will coordinate in association with other stakeholders such as concern worldwide canal maintenance operations. The Number of satellites will depend on the size of the area (geographical factors) and facilitation by DDMC. Com position of committees will be as provided for in the Disaster Management Policy of 2005. District Disaster Management Committees (DDMC). This is a sub -committee of the District Development Coordinating Committee (DDCC) which again is chaired by the DC and is responsible for the coordination all development function in the district. The secretariat of the DDCC is district administrative officer within the local authorities (Council Secretary). DMMU'S Activities in the project area include : Community mobiliz ation and monitoring of clearing of canals for disaster related works e.g. relief transport, Drainage for flood abatement Coordination of disaster management Works among all Stakeholders e.g. harbour master, NGOs, BRE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (MOF) The mandate of the MOF is to provide f inance and development planning guidelines for project activities th rough the Treasury and the PPCR. The MoF has 12 departments namely: Human Resources and Administration (HRA) Budget Office (BO) Government Stores (GS) Central Com puterized Service (CCS) Finance Management and Administration (FMA) Investments and Debt Management (IDM) Central Statistical Office (CSO) Internal Audit (IA) 2.

The PPCR Secretariat is a multi -sectorial climate change mitigation programme involving several Ministries and Agencies. It a dministers the implementation of the present project on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, and acts as a programme management unit; Inter-sectorial technical committees (ISTC) have been established under the PPCR to provide for coordination of mandates and functions of projects of participating Ministries. In this regard it is expected that the ISTC will facilitate faster collaboration and coordination of PPCR activities; Provision of finding for the project activities; Provision of management support to th e Provincial Planning Unit (PPU) under the regional Planner whose activities in 2013 and 2014 budget used as updating Provincial development , profile, monitoring and evaluation promotions of public , private partnerships PPU's budget; Provision of socio - economic data produced by CSO needed by the project; and Through the PPU, Update provincial profits, monitoring and evaluation of projects productions of investment plans promotion of public, private partnerships. CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS (CSO S) AND NON GOVERNMENT ORGANISATION (NGO S) NGOs g enerally support different groups of people in organizing them, training and logistics . Civil Society organizations have a presence at the Provincial and District level, though many of them are guided and supported by their national offices which are based in Lusaka. In terms of operations, their work is mainly service provision at the community level. The larger NGOs such as Oxfam provide resources for training, community mobilization and extension support. In the course of implementing their work, these organizations have had to take up the clearing of canals although this is not formally their mandate. They have developed capacity for canal maintenance mainly to ensure that they are able to access to the communiti es along the canals which they have selected to work with. Their priorities for maintenance are the small (tertiary and secondary ) canals which flow into the main canals. NGOs often get involved in O&M of canals because the institutions with the mandate t o do so fail. As the NGOs' functions depends on the use of the canals, they remain with no option but to do the necessary canal maintenance on specific areas when service from government is unavailable PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVEMENT Apart from the Financial Sector and Construction Industry, there is a very small private sector to talk about in Mongu District. Institutions that would qualify as entrepreneurs include; boat -makers, fish mongers, fish traders (marketeers), transporters and farmers. However, assoc iations are nascent and are yet to emerge into fully -fledged associations. 2. Policy, Institutional and Organisational Framework Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditi onal canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 24 Because of their nascent status, many of these organizations focus mainly on their internal growth challenges in the face completion and as such little capacity to respond to extern al demands such as contributing to the maintenance of canals. Therefore, the private sector contribution to the O&M of the canals is insignificant. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACIT Y ANALYSIS FOR CANAL MAINTENANCE The status of the canals has degraded over the last de cades, because they have not been well - maintained. Despite this fact, the importance of canals is well recognized among the stakeholders, but the interest and commitment is limited to a few institutions, mainly the BRE, Department of Maritime and Inland Wa terways (MTWSC), PPCR (MoF), DMMU and its associated committees (OVP), District Administration (DC) and Local Authorities (MLGH). Of these that have interested stakeholders, some are involved in the actual O&M of the canals including the BRE, Department of Maritime and Inland Waterways, DMMU, Local authorities/ District administration and Civil Society Organizations. The multiplicity of stakeholders involved reflects the multiple uses of the canals. However, the responsibilities for canals operation and maintenace and financial procedures are not well defined. The interventions focusing on the maintenance of the canals are often reactive and not planned well in advance: the.operation and maintenance is decided without a global vision, depending on each institution's priorities: The Department of Maritime which is allocated funds from the MoF prioritizes navigation canals. The funds are distributed irregularly, and not at adequate periods for maintenance. This can be interpreted as a lack of interest and co mmitment. The DMMU, who is in charge of relief maize distribution, takes this opportunity to maintain canals through food -for-works contracts, but they target food insecurity wards, and not prioritized areas are canal reaches for maintenance. Within the wa rds, the Village Headmen, Satellites and DDMC orientate the maintenance towards their priority reaches; Within the context of their support to local communities, NGOs are involved in canals maintenance. The maintenance of the reaches of canals derive from the opportunity of the partnerships with some communitites, and once again is distinct from a prioritization of hotspots of maintenance. The communities themselves have lost the consciousness and reflex of self -help: they are conditioning the clearing of c anals to the release of foods or funds, although they are the main beneficiaries for the good maintenance of canals. Locally, communities also depend on the maintenance that has been done by the communities upstream and downstream (tragedy of the Commons). Thus, when a community does not do its own part of maintenance on a canal, other communities along this canal may suffer from the consequences. Collaboration between the ministries is very weak. In same fashion, there is very little synergy between depart ments. For instance , a representative of the Department of Maritime and Inland Waterways admit ted that the Department is unable to mobilize other relevant government departments and agencies to leverage available resources for canal O&M. Mandated instituti ons have neither a canal master plan in place nor a specific institutional strategic plan that includes canal O&M. In the absence of these plans , it is not surprising that there is no alternative investment plan for the canals, instead the practice of over -reliance on government funding which appeared to be inadequate. It can be concluded that there is a real need for planning of canals maintenance and coordination of the stakeholders, that could be done through a canal O&M plan and the creation of a coordi nation institution consisting of representatives of the main stakeholders. 2. Policy, Institutional and Organisational Framework Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 25 In terms of technical capacity, there are no specialist skills in canal operations and maintenance in any of the key mandated institutions even in the Ministry of Transport, Works, Supply and Communications. In addition, the institutions lack maintenance guidelines, maps, design document and even ordinary tools (shovels, spades, picks etc). The only equipment available is the dredger, however without GPS and sufficient pipe length. T hus, there is also a need for further equipment and capacity building of both the technical staff and the key stakeholders involved in canal management. 2.3 INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENTIONS Zambia is a signatory to the following International agreement s, conventions and/or treaties: These are agreements and conventions are very relevant to the canal rehabilitation project in the Barotse Flood Plain of the Western Province.

In the Western Province, 3,000 km of canals and waterways network are recorded, which includes the 660 km of canals in Mongu district. The canals in Barotse are interlinked and form a complex network, composed of three main types of canals: Canals coming from the uplands, which were dug out from natural streams coming down from the uplands plateau. They are important for the drainage of dambos and agricultural land; Navigation canals from the edge of the plain to the Zambezi, that are also d raining water from the edge of the plain to the Zambezi; Drainage canal on the edge of the plain (Musiamo), collecting water from the local network of secondary and tertiary canal for drainage, and draining water towards the canalsconnected to the Zambezi. This study concentrates on six \"priority canals\" which have been selected by the PPCR and the BRE. Their main characteristics are summarized in the section below. In particular, the length and extent of the canals measured by the topographic team is displ ayed. Canals enhance the use of natural resources, enabling multiple uses and livelihoods, which are critical for the economy of both the local people and fish traders coming from all over Zambia: Canals support the important function of navigation and tra nsport in the Barotse plain where roads are few and almost non -existent during the flood period. Transportation is operated using mainly canoes (and marginally motor boats). Canals enable trading activities, people transportation, and is central in the Kuo mboka ceremony that is assumed to bring increasing touristic revenues in the area. Canals facilitate early drainage of floodwaters from the plain. The floods of the Zambezi leave behind fertile alluvial soils for crop production and fresh pasture for tradi tional cattle herding, with canals and wetlands becoming watering points for cattle and water resource for irrigation. Both activities are key economic activities for most Lozi people of the Barotse Plains. The area provides natural habitats for wildlife a nd fishes, and fishing activities take place in the canals. Reeds and sedges are cropped for construction and handicraft. The area is recognized both for its cultural heritage and for biodiversity. Many canals are interlinked in the Barotse area. The prese nt study will focus on the six priority canals, which have been chosen by the Client together with local institutions for their significance. A field visit conducted during the tendering period enabled to characterize briefly the targeted canals as shown i n the next table . 3.

Project Description Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 32 Before the Independence of Zambia the Barotse canals were maintained using compulsory labor. After the independence (1964) the maintenance of canals has been transferred to the Department of Water Affairs. In 1991, t he responsibility of maintaining the canals was given to the Department of Maritime, but according to the Habour Master, insufficient funds were allocated, which impacted the quality of the maintenance and the canals network degraded . Local people were to work on canal maintenance but the incentive was put on labor quantity without a vision on quality, and the results were not satisfying. Also, people were receiving incentives (food for work) to maintain the canals. Today, populations have lost of the sense of responsibility in canal maintenance that has lead to canal degradation.

Lifetime of the Project is not defined since with operation and maintenance activity canal will remain usable. 3.5 MAIN ACTIVITIES 3.5.1 Participative approach Part of Project preparation involved extensive public consultation through three workshops. The rehabilitation work of the canals as well as the introduction of a new Operation and Maintenance Program were subject to major discussion s with various stakeholders since rehabilitation may serve different interests . This was done to ensur e social acceptability of the Project . The Project relied on stakeholder's extensive knowledge of the area and their opinions were incorporated in th e restoration/rehabilitation options for work . Three stakeholders' workshops were organized in Mongu: 1st stakeholders' workshop in September 2013 . This workshop was made to present to stakeholders the Project and the participative process for developing the Project. The ESIA process and the various studies that were going to take place were also presented. Fo r the ESIA, this workshop helped identified local population concerns, and the key players in socio -economic of the area . There were no specific concerns regarding the ESIA that are worth mentionning ; 2nd stakeholders' workshop in January 2014 : participa tive discussion on proposed work to carry out. During this workshop, the baseline and impact assessment section of the ESIA were presented to the public. There were no comments related to the ESIA baseline and impact assessment. 3rd stakeholders' worksho p in March 2014 : Presentation of the Project and the ESIA; Discussions and notice of stakeholders' issues and concern s to take into account in the final ESIA (and the final Conceptual Design) ; Presentation of the Conceptual design proposals and obtai n stak eholders' feedbacks on it; To agree and complete consultant's proposals and discuss the detailed rehabilitation works and maintenance practices per canal ; Creation of new institutional arrangement for management of canals ; Creation of Canal User Associati ons (Water User Associations); Presentation of the Operation and Maintenance program for canals. 3.

One ESIA discussion group was formed to take into account any concerns. One person raised the issue of over drainage of the plateau land around Lubitamei if its drainage would be improved. This issue was dealt with in the conceptual design and measures were develop to avoid over drainage (see section on rehabilitation of Lubitamei). The proposed Wetland manageme nt plan (see section on cumulative impact on wetlands) was presented to participants. They agree that such plan is important with increase pressure on wetlands. The list of participant f or each workshop is presented in annex 10 3.5.2 Site preparation phase Const ruction phase will not necessitate particular site preparation. 3.5.3 Construction phase Presentation of the construction activities are based on the Conceptual Design report. 3.5.3.1 Muoyowamo canal PURPOSE The proposed rehabilitation works of Muoy owamo canal aim at p roviding better navigation for the boats in the canal by recalibration of the canal and providing ship logs . Ship logs will enable to control water levels in such a way that during the Kuomboko ceremony boats can travel upstream. WORKS The proposed works f or this canal are based on two major issues which are the water depth in the canal for the Kuomboka ceremony and the sand deposit mostly at Limulunga harbor. These two issues results in the following proposals: For the shallow draught it is proposed to re calibrate the canal and build ship lock structures in order to create separated canal sections with controlled water depth; For the sand deposit it is proposed to create a sand trap 1 km upsteam in Namitome canal . It is proposed to provide two sluices at t he upstream reach, at chainages 13,793 m and 17 ,355 m. The purpose of these structures is to provide sufficient dr aught by increasing the depth of water upstream. The canal wi ll be filled from the inflow coming from the Namimitome. The sluices will create retention of water and reduc e flow velocity. The combination of two gates in one sluice reduces the volume of water required to increase the water level. In case of a single gated sluice the boat will have to wait 3 to 4 hours before the water level has in creased by one meter. This will be reduced to 15 minutes in case of a double gated structure. In order to maintain sufficient dr aught for the entire reach of the canal , it is proposed to recalibrate the river bed with a 6 m bed width cross section and 1/1.5 side slopes . The total volume of excavation is 68,500 m3. The water level at the upstream location is maintained. The spoil will be placed on the existing dikes of the canal. The ship locks will facilitate navigation even when the water level in the Zamb ezi is lower . The following graphs show the current situation and the situation after the works. 3.

The creation of a specific path or service road would anyway eas e in future access and maintenance. DESCRIPTION OF SHIP L OCK STRUCTURES Ship locks are designed to maintain a water level in its upstream part and to allow as required the transit of the water from upstream toward downstream without significant flow speed. Each structure will be built in concrete, laying across the whole width of the canal. This width will allow the Royal Boat to cross the structure . 0 5000 10000 15000 200001008101010121014101610181020MUYAMO Plan: Q_2 0 5000 10000 15000 200001008101010121014101610181020MUYAMO from Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Za mbezi 39 The closing gate between two canal section will be done either by a metallic flap gate operated from both s ide like drawbridge by metallic chain notched wheel with leverage and removable crank handle or by means of stop logs. DESCRIPTION OF SAND T RAP In order to catch the sand before it enters Muoyowamo it is foreseen to create a sand trap on the Namitome canal . It has been designed to catch the sand grain down to 0.1 mm for a discharge up to 5m3/s. This sand trap will be located about one kilometer north of the confluence with Muoyowamo canal. It will be cut at the foot hill close to the road. It is indeed abs olutely necessary to have an access road for mechanical maintenance of the sand trap and evacuation of the sand by trucks. An access track will allow access to the sand trap in order to load and evacuate the deposit during maintenance operation. The device will have The objectives for the rehabilitation of this canal are to improve drainage, fishery and transport along the Lubitamei . The rehabilitation of Lubitamei cou ld facilitate fish spawning and migration, thus enhancing fishing activities in the canal and upstream dambos. Agricultural production could also be improved, and commercial farming could even take place. This would create incomes and employments which are really needed in this remote area . WORK The proposed cross section will have a bed width of 4m and a side slope of 1.5 /1. The volume of excavation for this proposal amounts 372,260 m3. This includes the entire length of Lubitamei canal . The following grap h shows the proposed work (in purple) and the existing condition (black line). 3. Project Description Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 40 Figure 4 Lubitamei, Proposed canal section of the upstream reach The rehabilitation works of Lubitamei canal consist in the re -excavation, building of dikes and providing one pipe culvert, three water control structures and two sand traps , one on each branch of the Lubitamei. The proposed design of sand trap is identic with the one proposed for Muoyowamo One water control structure will be built where a n important rice farm, some kilometres downstream Mangue school, derives water for irrigation. Two water control structures will be built each just downstream a dambo in order to control water levels and prevent the dambo from overdrainage, hence facilitat ing cultivation of flood recession crops. Mangue School bridge, which is broken, will be re -built after demolition of the existing one. The new structure will be made with 7 concrete pipes with internal diameter 900 mm and 4 m length. ACCESS There are no p articular difficulties to access with excavators during the dry season at any place of the canal. 3.5.3.3 N'gombala canal PURPOSE The design of N'gom bala canal is made in order to improve navigation between the Malile and the Zambezi. The improvement is proposed to be made by connecting Zambezi and Malile rivers. WORK The canal will be reshaped so that it maintain s the minimum dr aught depth required for navigation (1.5 m) and sufficient canal width for safe movement of boats (4 m) The proposed bed side slope will be 1/ 1.5. The bed level has been increased without impacting the minimum dr aught depth . This has decreased the velocity since the discharge also decreased . -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 81058.51059.01059.51060.01060.51061.0Stream Centerli - Reach 1 RS: 79590.82 StationElevationLegend Modified XS Ground Bank Sta T emplate -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 41 ACCESS The site is not accessible for excavator due to the absence of bridge , dredger will be used. 3.5.3.4 Nebubela PURPOSE The design of Nebubela canal aims at improv ing navigation between Malile and Mongu h arbour. The objective of the proposed rehabilitation works is to remove the sand banks in order to maintain the minimum draught depth required for n avigat ion and sufficient canal width for safe movement of boats . WORK The design of Nebubela canal requ ires provision of sufficient dra ught and width for the canal. The existing situation has nearly adequate dra ught and width for most of the reach. However, this requires removal of the sand banks on the bed and side slopes o f the canal. The present design proposes to provide a canal bed width of 10 m and 1.5 /1 side slopes . The total excavation of the pro posed rehabilitation works amounts 40,500 m3.In addition it is proposed to remove about 15,000 m3 of old spoil banks in order to improve the bank stability and prevent part of the materials to slide back into the canal. The following graph shows the proposed work (purple) and the existing situation (black). Figure 5 Proposed typical canal cross section for Nebubela canal It is proposed to build a sand trap just upstream the harbor. The proposed design is identic with the one proposed for Muoyowamo.

WORK The propose d canal section will have a 4 m bed width and 1.5 /1 side slope. The design of F isheries canal upgrading works focused on the provision of improved navigation throughout the year . The following graph shows the proposed work (in purple) and the existing cond ition (black line). Figure 6 Fisheries canal - proposed cross section CROSSING POINTS FOR CATTLE It is proposed to build at the main cattle crossings of Fisheries an excavated path with a 10% slope in order to prevent bank erosio n. Those paths will have a base width of 6 m and have 1/1.5 side slopes. The average length of one approach track will be about 35 m on each side of the canal. Provision has been made for including 3 cattle crossings. Access there are no particular difficu lties to access with construction machineries during the dry season at any place of the canal except around the harbour at Namushakende. This zone is made mostly of peat soils and will require swamp excavator for earthworks and creation of specific trail f or truck if soil evacuation is needed. Creation of a service road will ease maintenance works and monitoring . 3.5.3.6 Musiamo PURPOSE It is proposed to rehabilitate the Musiamo canal in order to enable both evacuation of excess water and control of water level s. In addition five crossing are proposed for facilitating access to the Barotse Plain. 0 5 10 15 20 25 301004100510061007100810091010Stream Centerli - Reach 1 RS: 8407.2* StationElevationLegend Modified XS Ground Bank Sta T and Soci al impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 43 WORK The rehabilitation works consist in re -excavation of the Musiamo canal in order to allow a water depth of 1 m, uniform longitudinal slopes and 1/1.5 side slopes . Current depth of canal is generally between 1 and 1.5 m. 3 m bed width has been adopted as this corresponds best with the present situation. The spoil will be placed on the western bank of the canal. CROSSING S From North to South we have selected 5 different s ites to be rehabilated to piped bridges with 2 concrete pipes of internal diameter of 900 mm and 4 m length . All of them are already used by the local population and connected to the road network. They are the following: Lyomboko road crossing Road crossin g North of Mongu along the old Limulunga road Katongo Road crossing at the Namushakende Harbour Road crossing at Namangomba WATER CONTROL STRUCTU RES Water Control structures are proposed at 10 locations: 5 on the first reach of the canal, 3 on the second reach and 2 on the third reach. ACCESS FOR EXCAVATION Access for excavator is limited in many areas due to deep peat bogs, excavation will be done by foot and dredging will be done manually . 3.5.3.7 Namitome canal PURPOSE The Namitome canal or river supplies the M uoyowamo canal with a regular flow. Part of the flows spills in the Barotse plain 10 km upstream of the Limulunga. As this river/canal is causing regular flooding water logging of the adjacent fields, it has been proposed to increase its flow capacity by removing the bunds in the river bed and increasing its width. WORK The volume of excavation of proposed rehabilitation works amounts 19,814m3. The proposed cross section of the canal will have a bed width of 3 m and side slope of 1/1.5. The following graph shows the proposed work (in purple) and the existing condition (black line). 3.

The creation of a specific path or service road would anyway ease in future access and maintenance. 3.5.3.8 Siltation basins It is proposed to build 7siltation basins for storing and desilting of the expelled mix from dredgers when they dr edged the sand banks at the junctions of the canals and the rivers, more precisely: 1 at the junction of Nebubela and Malile 1 at the junction of Fisheries canal and Zambezi 1 at the junction of Fisheries with southern branch of Malile 1 at the junction of N'gombala and Zambezi 1 at the junction of N'gombala and Malile 1 at the junction of Muoyowamo and Malile WORK It is proposed to build temporary basins by removing the top soils by bulldozer and create a bund. The total area will be 1 ha. The total lengt h of the bund will be 400 m and its height 1.5 m. The corresponding volume will hence be about 2 000 m3. Once the siltation basin is filled and the levels are about 1 m higher the siltation basin should be abandoned. A new basin will be built aside. The p lot having increased ground levels may become partially flood -protected and gain in value. 3.5.4 Operation phase The Project is not an industrial process, there is no operation phase . However, the Project will require maintenance, this maintenance will not necessitate additional activities from those already described. -15 -10 -5 0 5 101041.01041.21041.41041.61041.81042.0Namitome River - Upstream RS: 15565.4* StationElevationLegend Modified XS Ground Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in th e Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 45 4. PROJECT ALTERNATIVES 4.1 IDENTIFICATION OF ALT ERNATIVES There are no alternativ es to the proposed Project since it is a rehabilitation project that aims at improving identified canals and identifi ed structures (bridges, etc.). The rehabilitation works that are proposed in the conceptual design report are based on a participative approach meaning that they have widely accepted during workshops. However, several alternatives were studied for Fisheri es canal restoration: 1. Improved drainage by providing a regular and uniform bed slope; 2. Improved irrigation possibilities, by facilitating access of Zambezi water throughout the year all over its length, in addition to an improved drainage service. This opti on also enables navigation with canoes; 3. Improved navigation (with motor boats) from January till July, in addition to improved drainage service and irrigation possibilities; 4. Multipurpose : polder (dike providing flood protection throughout the year) enabli ng agriculture thoughout the year as well as navigation from January till July. It has to be noted that this option would also require important investment for the polder development, that will not be detailed in the present study During the second worksh op, one alternative was selected based on social acceptability. 4.2 ANALYSIS OF EACH OF T HE IDENTIFIED ALTERN ATIVES OPTION 1 : IMPROVED DRAINAGE The aim is to evacuate excess water with the canal to avoid stagnation of water in the vicinity of fisheries. Th erefore, this option proposes to excavate/dredge the undulating bed of Fisheries so that water can easily drain to the Zambezi River . The total volume of excavation is 30,686 m3. In parallel it is proposed to provide 3 ford crossings . 4. Project Alternatives Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 46 Figure 8 Water profile in Fisheries after option 1 OPTION 2 IMPROVED IRRIGATION A ND DRAINAGE (AND NAVIGATION FOR C ANOES ) In this option it is proposed to provide water throughout the year in the whole reach of the canal. The proposed bed level for im proved irrigation at the outfall of fisheries canal is 1004.634 m. This bed level ensures a minimum of 0.6 m depth throughout the year for 4 years out of 5 (based on the Water level data of Matongo Plato, and October 2013 topo survey) . The total volume of excavation for this option is 107,728m3. This is due to the deeper excavation so that to avail the water during low flow season to irrigation . The water levels don't enable navigation with motor boats throughout the year , but navigation with canoes is made possible at the condition that no bridges are built.

The bed level will be 1004.6m. To enable navigation, bridges have not been inserted in the proposal . The to tal volume of excavation for this option is also 300,000m3. OPTION 4 : POLDER WITH SAME INSIDE BED LEVEL IDENTIC WITH OPTION 1 AND OUTSIDE BED LEVE L IDENTIC AS OPTION 3 This option proposes building a flood dike to protect potential agriculture land from f looding (currently the land is made of wetlands and agricultural land) , and thus enabling the cultivation of 4200 ha potential irrigated area throughout the year. The flood dike will require a freeboard of 0.9 m and a crest width of 3 m. The dike will be p rovided with a service road inside the polder. A regulator is proposed at the crossing of flood dike and fisheries canal. A pump station will have to be built here in order to enable both irrigation in dry season and drainage during high water levels in th e Zambezi. The canal bed maintains a 0.3 m / km slope upstream of the regulator and horizontal between the dike and Zambezi. The total volume of excavation for this option is 200,000 m3. The design of the irrigation & drainage & road network is not part of this study. 4.3 LIST OF CHOSEN ALTERN ATIVES IN ORDER OF P REFERENCE Workshop participants have assessed the proposals of the Consultant, preferring option n\u00b03 where both navigation with motor boat, drainage and irrigation are possible. This choice has been co nfirmed by focus group discussions held in Namushakende on the 1st of February 2014, within the framework of the social survey . In terms of environmental impacts, the following options are classified by increasing order of adverse environmental impact: Option 1 is the most environmental friendly option since it involves light excavation Option 2 involves more excavation than option 1, Option 3 involves more excavation than option 2, and also allow for the use of motor boats in the canal. Option 4 is the m ost environmentally impacting option since it involves the construction of a dike that will completely severed water infeed to nearby wetland s and will involve conversion of wetland to agricultural land s. 4.4 REASONS FOR CHOOSING THE PREFERRED ALTERN ATIVES AN D REJECTING THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES Social implication of each option gave preference to option 3. Workshops participants preferred option n\u00b03 where both navigation with motor boat, drainage and irrigation are possible. This choice has been confirmed by fo cus group discussions held in Namushakende on the 1st of February 2014, within the framework of the social survey . 5.

Figure 10 Number of hours of sunshine per months Source: World Weather and Climate information, 2014 5.1.1.2 Mean temperature in the study area September and October are t he warmest months in Mongu with average low temperature of 18\u00b0 (night temperature) and average high temperature of 36 -37\u00b0 (day temperature). Coolest months are from May to July where average low temperature are around 10\u00b0 and average high are around 28 - 30\u00b0. 5.1.1.3 Rainfall patterns During a year, the rainfall is characterized by a rainy season from October to April. The maximum amount of rainfall per month is recorded in average in January (more than 200 mm at Mongu). June to August is the driest period with almo st no rain . The following image illustrates the average rainfall per month for Mongu. 5. Environmental Baseline Study -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 49 Source: BRLi, 2013 5.1.1.4 Climate change perspectives Analysis of climat e trends over the past decades, undertaken by the Zambia Meteorological Department (ZMD) highlights at national scale: An increase in the frequency of extreme events such as by floods and droughts over the past four decades. An emerging tendency of a delayed onset of the rainfall and earlier cessation, thus resulting in a shorter season with a more intense rainfall. A trend towards an increase in temperature in both the cool (June, July, August) and warm season (September -October). Different studies have been conducted about the possible effects of climate change in Zambia (Nkomok & al 1999; studies carried out by the IPCC, and as part of the UNDP climate change country profiles). They give consistent results regarding temperature but projection for future changes in rainfall are uncertain. The mean annual temperature is expected to increase in a range of bet ween 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C by 2075. The temperature might increase during all seasons, especially at the beginning of the rainy season (September -October -November). The Barotse is located in one of the areas in Zambia where the expected increase of temperature is hi ghest . 02468101214161820 050100150200250 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Rainy daysmm MonthAverage rainfall per month -Mongu Average number of rainy days Average rainfall5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 50 Projection of future changes in rainfall don't always give consistent results. Depending on the Global Climatic Model used and on the greenhouse gases emission scenario considered, mean annual precipitation trends vary. The work of Nkomok et al 1999 projected a decrease in annual precipitation throughout Zambia by the year 2075, whereas the work undertaken in the UNDP climate change country profile concludes that projections of mean annual rainfall do not indicate large changes (simulations give proj ections of increase or decrease in precipitation depending on the emission scenario considered). However, for all scenarios, a decrease in rainfall is projected during the season (September -October -November). Climatic models do not allow concluding on the change in frequency and magnitude of extreme events (no statistical significance). However, different studies mentioned an increase in climate change variability and change (El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a events and increasing variation in the migration of the Inter -tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)). Surveys carried out among people living in Barotse highlight the fact that populations feel that there is an increase in variability in seasonality of rainfall and flows. Moreover, an increase in occurrence of floods has been recorded during the past decades (see next table). It is not certain in which extend this increase is due to climate change, as it can also be explained by higher sensitivity (cultivation and new settlement created in flood -prone areas). 1974 - 1983 1984 - 1993 1994 - 2003 2004 - 2013 Drought 2 1 1 1 Flood 1 1 5 10 Consequences for the population of Barotse are already observed and mentioned in different studies such as the LYVA project, and the Community adaptation to climate variability in the upper Zambez i floodplain, (Flint, 2008). These impacts could be worsened in the future by climate change, they include: Clearance of forests and other vegetation on the watershed area result in augmentation of stream flow both in volume and velocity. When combined wit h extreme rainfall events they can cause flash floods causing erosion and damaging crops and infrastructures. There has been a reduction in the number of annual inundations and an increased variability of weather including more frequent violent storms that have damaging impacts on human activities. Because the water from rainfall in the watershed areas arrives at greater speed and volume, and because the total precipitation is either less or little changed but appears to be taking place in a shorter rainy s eason (later onset), flood regression, once it commences, takes place much faster than previously: there is not a gradual transition from aquatic to terrestrial state. Therefore the limit of receding water, which in the past was slow, allowing considerable production of biota, now moves faster, taking with it some of the nutrient and silt to deposit downstream. Difficulties for the population to anticipate and loss of traditional landmarks due to heightened uncertainty and increasing unpredictability. Shortening of the cropping season due to the shortening of the period between the start and cessation of rain (Flint, 2008) Climate change could also provoke: Increased incidence of floods as the incidence of heavy rainfall events increases Additional pressu re on forest and desertification in the upstream part of the catchment due to drought and excessive temperatures, resulting in faster run -off and floods. This will cumulate with the impacts of deforestation and inadequate land management, and with the impa ct of extreme rainfall events. Increase prevalence of livestock disease due to increasing temperature. Increased risk of water pollution and decreased water quality due to erosion, 5.

However, there are no known sources of industrial poll ution in the Barotse plain. 5.3 HYDROLOGY 5.3.1 Orography of the area The mains feature of the orography in the area is the Barotse Flood plain which is 230 km long from North to South and 30 km wide (CGIAR, 2012). It is very flat plain with a very slight slope. T he altitude at Lukulu being 1035 m and 1000 m at Senanga, the average slope of the plain is only 0.015 %. Within the study area, the average height in the plain is 1012 m above sea level in Mongu district. The lowest points are at 1008 m close to the Zamb ezi, and the highest points are constituted of the artificial mounts where villages are built and maize is cultivated ( lizulu ). This mounts are 2 or 3 m above the average level of the plain, which enables to be maintained above floodwaters. For example, th e Royal Capital of Lealui is standing at 1015 m (Surveyor General, 1987 b). Surrounding the flood plain are the sandy uplands (plateau), with an average height around Mongu of 1070 m above sea level. In the uplands, the high points are reaching 1105 m (be tween Mongu and Limulunga). The low points are found in the local deflation pans and dambos, which bottom points are at 1050 m. The municipality of Mongu itself is at an average of 1040 m, with the harbor being at the plain level and the highest point at 1060 m (Surveyor General, 1987 a). Between the plain and the plateau is a sandy slope that climbs 45 m (from 1015 to 1060 m above sea level) in 500 m, which gives an average slope of 9 %. 5.3.2 Natural water bodies The Zambezi River is the main water body in the study area, it flows from north to south and floods the plains every years around January to June. The exact date, duration and intensity of the flood vary every year depending on the rainfall on the catchment area. Due to the slight slope, the Zambezi f lows in the plain with numerous meanders. As It has changed is bed in recent history, there are many oxbow lakes and even secondary river beds like the \"Little Zambezi\", (locally known as Malile) which is an arm of the main river connected both upstream an d downstream. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 52 There are several small tributaries to the Zambezi river coming from the uplands and crossing the study area, which have been more or less canalized for agriculture. We can mention from North to South: Nakalomo: a small stream coming from la ke Makapaela, 12 km North East of Limulunga and feeding Lubitamei canal. Namitome: an important canalized stream which takes it source in a wetland 25 km East of Mongu, then crosses the Mongu / Lusaka road 10 km East of Mongu and goes North to Limulunga t o feed Muyowamo canal. Kambule: a stream passing in the middle of Mongu town, then feeding Musiamo canal. Sefula: a stream, coming from a spring 10 km East of Sefula village, canalized to provide water for the Sefula Rice Scheme and then joining the Littl e Zambezi in the plain. Kataba: a stream coming from Lushi, Mumbwana and Mukangu lakes, 25 km East of Namushakende. It feeds Lwandala canal which joins the Zambezi river South of Nalolo. There are also several wetlands on the uplands. Some are seasonal l akes, being flooded from January to June, others are year round lakes, like lake Makapaela . 5.3.3 Hydrology and hydraulics of the Barotse flood plain The Barotse flood plain receives inflows from several tributary: Luanginga River (catchment area 34,600 km2), right bank Luena River (20,500 km2) (upstream it River in the downstream part after Senanga station so they don't influence directly the project ar ea. Other minor tributaries are connected to the Zambezi close to the project area, namely: Lubitamei, left bank, which drains part of the Luena flat water, Namitome, right bank, Sefula, left bank, Kataba , right bank .

Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 54 The hydrology of the Zambezi River can thus be summarized as follows: Source: BRLi 5.3.4 Hydraulic fun ctioning of the canals Several canals follow the natural thalwegs that have been recalibrated, rectified and maintained for an optimized human use. The following figure shows the Mongu distric main canals: Lubitamei and Namitome canals can be considered as rivers in their upper course, as their bed seems quite natural. They are draining dambos in the upland. Lubitamei canal is contributing to the drainage of the southern part of the Luena flats. Most of canals located in the floodplain (Muoyowamo, N ebub ela, Fisheries, downstream part of Lubitamei, etc.) are draining water from the edge of the floodplain to the Zambezi or the Little Zambezi. Some of them are used for navigation; Slow decrease Early June to October Fast decrease Mid-April to early June Second peak End of March - Early April Low water level Mid-October First peak Mid-February - Early March Slow increase End of October to early December Fast increase Early December to February Upstream part of the Zambezi river Low water level End of October Slow increase Early November to mid - December Fast increase Mid-December to March Slow decrease End of April to end of October Peak April Barotse plain 5.

It starts at Limulunga harbor, runs in almost straight line to the South West for 18.8 km then ends when joining Malile, 1 km South of Lealui. It is fed with water by Namitome stream coming from the upland and several secondary canal s bringing water from Musiamo. In Lealui , the Royal harbor is called Nayuma, it is constituted of a 100 m stretch perpendicular to the main canal, where the Kuomboka ce remony starts from. The Muoyowamo canal is currently interrupted for navigation by the construction of the Mongu -Kalabo road downstream of Lealui harbor. The hydraulic continuity has been maintained through culverts. 5. Environm ental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 56 MUSIAMO CANAL Musiamo is running from North to South on 52.2 km on the edge of the plain, between 100 and 500 m from the bottom of the slope. This particular area is naturally waterlogged by the groundwater seeping. Musiamo was built to allow agriculture on these soils by draining the plain ed ge's at the bottom of the slope. Musiamo starts from Limulunga (300 m South of the harbor) and ends close to Nasiwayo school, where it connects with Lwandala canal. The role of this canal is crucial for the agriculture and the food security of the whole re gion, as the drainage allows farming on fertile soils. Musiamo has the particularity of not being a continuous canal, it is interrupted in Mongu and Namushakende by the harbors and in Sefula by the rice Scheme. It is also connected with numerous secondary canals which evacuate the drained water to the Muyowamo canal (North of Mongu) and to the Malile (South of Mongu), which then join the Zambezi river. Thus, the water is not flowing in the same direction all along the way. LUBITAMEI CANAL Lubitamei is an a gricultural waterway dug from a natural stream in Nangula valley . Its role is to drain this valley to facilitate agriculture and to avoid its flooding. The flow is sust ained by the outlet of several wetlands such a as Miulwe located 4 km North of the Mongu / Lusaka road 30 km East of Mongu. The Canal itself starts from Ndiki heading North and passes through the locality of Nangula. Then at Lyomboko, it is joined by a tributary called Nakweti coming from the South West which is clogged with vegetation. After Mangue the valley becomes wider as Lubitamei reaches the South of the Luena flats. Close to Kate school, Lubitamei has been blocked and the water is diverted to supply a large commercial farm in Muye. In consequence , the water flows North while the rest of the canal is totally dry. Lubitamei then heads Westwards, passes close to Oosha, reaches the flood plain, then turn South West to end joining Malile 10 km North West of Lealui. As this canal is very long, some local people call it Nangula canal on the f irst stretch from Ndiki to Kate and then Nonge canal from Kate to the end (BRLi, 2013, interview with DC Limulunga) . FISHERIES CANAL Fisheries canal starts at Namushakende. It is fed by Musiamo which collects the water from several springs in the Namushake nde area. It flows in straight line to the West for 9 km and reaches the Zambezi close to a fishing camp called Umeniu . N'GOMBALA CANAL N'gombala canal joins the Little Zambezi (Malile) to the main Zambezi. It was dug to shorten distance for navigation. It starts 7 km South West of Mongu and runs 8.5 km joining natural lakes before reaching the Zambezi. According to the riverine populations, as it is connecting two water bodies with similar dynamics, its flow pattern is switching with season and water level : when water levels are raising in Zambezi and Malile, water is coming from both ends into the N'gombala canal and is flooding a wetland in the middle. However, during the recession period, N'gombala canal is draining the wetland, through both ends . NEBUBE LA CANAL This canal which is about 9,1 km long connects the Mongu harbor with the Malile river. It is the first part of the Mongu -Kalabo waterway. The soil is made of clayey material. A path allows access to Malile river from Mongu, but it does not follow the canal. This path is hence useless for maintenance. 5. Environmental Baseline Study p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 57 There is no particular bank stability problem on this canal . 5.4 HYDROGEOLOGY Kalahari sands are not uniform deposit but contain silt and clay layers so that although rainfall is immediately absorbed , percolation undergr ound is delayed and perced water table are common. However, in the flood plain, ground water recharge by rain is insignificant in comparison with the input from the annual flood which influences groundwater level. In the flood plain, there are groundwater seepage at the edge of the plateau . Ground water quality has not been assessed in the area, it is however believed to be free of pollutants since the use of fertilizer and pesticide is limited in the plain. 5.5 TOPOGRAPHY Around Mongu, t he 20 to 25 km wide floodplain lie s at an altitude of 1013 -1015 masl (meter above sea level). The edge of the Plateau toward Mongu has a slope of around 1.5 %, leading to a plateau at a height of around 1090 masl. Musiamo canal, at the plateau edge lies slightl y lower than the plain, which partly explain the long water retention in the vast peat bogs (see Wet grasslands description). Luena flats, to the North lies around 1030 masl , the slope to the plateau is around 0.5 % , Lubitamei canal lies slightly lower whi ch could also explain the long water retention in this wetlands (see Wet grasslands description). The whole Barotse flood plain has a southerly slope of less than 0.1%. Figure 12 Luena flat topography 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environm ental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 58 Figure 13 Barotse floodplain topography 5.6 GEOLOGY AND SOILS Geology of the study area is characterised by Kalahari sand (also called Barotse sand) deposit on Mongu plateau and Alluvium deposit in the flood plain Soils of the Barotse flood plain consist of the Bulozi terrace (in green in next figure ), outside of the flood plain soil are part of the Mongu -Kalabu terrace (in yellow) as shown in the following image. The Bulozi terrace is made of the Zambezi Alluvium (seasonnaly flooded sands and clays called Gleys ol with some mineral hydromorphic soils ). Around Lubitamei source, soil are Podzols (Barotse sands). Around Musiamo, peat bogs soils (organic hydromorphic soils) are overlying deposit of sand and silt , this is the seepage zone. 5.

Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Asse ssment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 60 5.7 LAND USE AND LAND TEN URE The interaction between the people inhabiting the Barotse Plain and their environment has given rise to a variety of land use systems that have enabled social and economic survival. Through an elaborate process of land reclamation involving piling of soil brought in from the upland, people formed mounds for purposes of habitation, agriculture and burial. In due course some of the mounds were abandoned and are now used as burial places while others continue to be habited and maintained with soil being h eaped onto existing ground to raise the ground level. Customary land under the jurisdiction of the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE) is regulated by the Barotse Royal Establishment Act of 1971 Section 6 (1) (B) which provides for traditional means of admin istration. The Act legitimizes the traditional system of administration. Under this act, the BRE has the power and responsibility over land administration and natural resource utilization except at household level. This includes land allocation and demarca tion of boundaries, settling land -related disputes, collection of land taxes and royalties as well as enforcing associated rules and regulations governing access to natural resources such as water bodies, i.e. lakes, rivers, streams, grass, plains, forests , dambos, lagoons, grazing land and forests.There is also a national land Policy and Act that provide for State -owned land and Traditional land. Under this Act all the land in the Barotse Floodplain falls under the traditional authority of the Barotse Roya l Establishment. The government allowed the BRE to run the land outside the council areas. To access traditional land, an application is made to a Senior Headman in the area (Silalanda), who conveys the application to the Litunga through a Silalo Induna. O nce approved, the applicant can apply to the Chief for a traditional title deed at a small fee. This practice is widely practiced in Western Province. The power to approve the application and issue a permit lies with the Litunga. When an individual is gran ted land, he does not really own it but has exclusive access to it for as long as he/she occupies his position within the village. The individual can delineate the land in question to family members, but not sell or mortgage it. Land is also passed on to f amily members through inheritance. The gender dimension entails that the land is passed on to the first -born child regardless of the sex, making females eligible to land (non -gender biased system of land tenure). This practice has resulted in a long tradit ion of land inheritance along kinship lines. The BRE representatives can only allocate land that no longer belongs to a particular family. Whilst instances of dispossession are rare, there are a number of land disputes and conflicts, which are usually reso lved by the immediate headman, or the higher court of Indunas at the royal palace. If a man re -locates to another village with all his family members, the abandoned piece of land is re - allocated to other people by the Silano Induna. Because of an increase in population and climate change -related effects, both habitable and arable land in the Barotse Floodplain is dwindling. Because of this, some sections of society perceive the Lozi land tenure system rather cumbersome, that it creates bottlenecks in the a llocation of land for development activities such as road construction, and that it prevents access by new comers and returnees. Some development writers on the land tenure in the Western province have tended to caution the land tenure system in the provin ce therefore. Land allocation in this traditional system provides de facto ownership to the applicant, though there is no de jure ownership thereby preventing the sale of the land or its use as surety for a loan. When new land is allocated from the customa ry authority, it is common for water bodies to be used as boundaries for land plots to maximize the number of water users (Chileshe et al., 2005). On the other hand, iinterviews with some members of the project -affected communities indicate that the prevai ling customary land tenure system in the Barotse Flood Plain is preferred to the leasehold tenure system on account of the fact that it allows equal access to the canals, ox -bow lakes and grazing lands by all cattle owners. Most people interviewed indicate d that as long as one belonged to a land -owning family then the land will be passed on to future generations. 5. Environmental Baseline Study p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 61 In fact during the consultative meeting on 12thSeptember 2013 between the Kuta, the team of consultants, Induna Katema, who is in charge of land a dministration for the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE) summarized the position of traditional authorities on land tenure as follows: \"The issue of land tenure system brought on the fabric of our existence as a people. If you destroy our land tenure system , you destroy our people. With this system, everyone in Barotseland has access to land. There are neither poor landless people nor rich who can buy a lot of land. Our system of land tenure guarantees land ownership, so no one should temper with our land.\" There is a national land Policy and Act that provide for State -owned land and Traditional land. Under this Act all the land in the Barotse Floodplain falls under the traditional authority of the Barotse Royal Establishment. The government allowed the BRE t o run the land outside the council areas. Lessons from the Sefula and Namushakende Rice Irrigation Schemes, where irrigation infrastructure is not used to its full potential, points to problems related to the traditional land tenure system. Farmers only ha ve access to the land and do not own it so they do not have access to credit needed to commercialize cultivation. Lessons learned from the Sefula and Namushakende irrigation schemes is that with the rice farming systems, women have significant roles to pl ay in land clearing, planting, harvesting and marketing and therefore, new irrigation projects promoting rice schemes ought to analyze the important role that women play in growing rice so that efforts are made to lessen their burden. LAND TENURE KEY ISSU ES As far as local inhabitants are concerned there have been no serious land conflicts in the areas of study. However, in some areas, discussions with communities also revealed that the land tenure system prevailing in the area does not favour the people b ecause members of the royal family own most of the arable land and local people have only access to portions of it but have no control over it. These communities are not happy with the arrangement as they feel like caretakers only. One other issue that was raised during social surveys and workshops is the fact that lands are allocated for life to people by the customary authority. People own land regardless if they use it or not. This leads to issue regarding the maintenance of canals since some owners do n ot feel concerned by canal maintenance because they are not using land for crop. People have mentioned that segments of canals would remain un -maintained or that some people would be opposed to canal maintenance because they were not using land for agricul ture and did not see the incentive to clean their sections of the canal. ADAPTATION TO CHANGE ASSESSMENT In order to characterize impact on sociological component, develop mitigation measures and assess resistance to change of a component (see next chapte r), it is important to describe people's perception of their land tenure system. how do local communities value/perceive their land tenure system? The land tenure system is one of the main political and economical issues in the Barotse area. It is still u nder the strict control of the BRE, which is very attached to this control. In fact, it is the only real power remaining under the BRE. This can explain why the land tenure is very important for this institution. During every workshop and meeting held duri ng this study, the BRE representatives insisted on the importance of keeping the traditional land tenure system. They emphasize on their refusal of selling the land to any company or non -Lozi investor, as to keep the land for the livelihood of the local fa rmers. do local communities and NGOs engage in activities in order to improve land tenure system? 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 62 Some private companies and investors are willing to change the land tenure system in order to be able to buy land and create industrial farms. They are encour aged in this direction by the Central Government, which has the will to develop a more productive and profit oriented agriculture in Western Province. NGOs and the Local Government do not want to engage in any activities which would directly aim at changin g the land tenure system. Because by doing so they would enter in frontal conflict with the BRE, which they have to avoid if they want to continue working in the area. The communities as a whole do not complain about the land tenure because they see it as protecting their right to a free access to the land, and prevent them from land grabbing by private or public institutions. Some young individuals complain that the only land that they can access through the BRE are very remote and unproductive land on t he upper land, as all the fertile fields in the plain are already attributed. Due to the gerontocratic structure of the traditional power, the youth have very few ways of changing the land tenure system. are people ready in terms of human resources and tec hnical capacity and are there willing to adaptto changes regarding land tenure system? It was clear from the discussion during the second stakeholder workshop that there is really two radically opposite opinion within the people on the land tenure issue. O n one side the majority of the rural people and the BRE, who are not willing to change or to adapt to change regarding the land tenure system. On the other side a minority of urban and business oriented people wants to change the system, so they can buy la nd to build commercial, industrial or farming infrastructures. Presently the BRE is still powerful enough to keep this position, but the situation can change in future years. With population growth and the attraction of the people to consumerism, the press ure on land might increase, forcing the BRE to change the system. The Sefula rice scheme is a good example of a project which partly failed because of resistance to change on the land tenure issue. In conclusion, local communities and the BRE are highly r esistant to change regarding land tenure system. 5.8 BUILT ENVIRONMENT : INFRASTRUCTURE IN TH E FLOODPLAIN 5.8.1 Mongu Harbour In the floodplain, Mulambwa Harbour handles goods destined for Kalabo as well as in - coming goods that include fish, milk and other products from the Barotse Plain . 5.8.2 Roads MONGU-KALABO ROAD The Mongu -Kalaboall weather road (34 km long) is a major under -construction infrastructure which starts from Mulambwa Harbour crossing the Zambezi River at Liyelelo Harbour and ending in Kalabo district in Ta po where it will join with the existing road to Kalabo. It is also envisaged that the same road will be linked to the Kalabo/Sikongo and it is hoped this will open the trade links with Angola. 5.

This project is reported to be the biggest and longest embankment road in Zambia after the Tuta Bridge on the Luapul a River in Central and Luapula Provinces. Currently, there is a motorized pontoon at Liyelelo servicing the east and west banks of the Zambezi River while the Matongopontoon on the Limulunga -Libonda Road is out of service. This road was subject to an Envi ronmental Impact Statement in accordance with Zambian regulations. MONGU - LUKULU ROAD There are plans to build the Mongu -Lukulu all weather road through the plain via Ushaa and Limulunga along the Barotse plain edge. MONGU- SENANGA ROAD The existing 103 k m bituminous road that links Mongu to Senanga follows the plateau parallel to the floodplain. This road was subject to an Environmental Impact Statement in accordance with Zambian regulations. CITY ROADS Mongu township roads cover 46.8 km of which 14.8 km are bituminous whilst 30 km are earth and sand and 2 km are gravel roads. SAND ROADS There are many sand roads in the floodplain that are used by local population. These roads are in poor condition and are only accessible by four -wheel drive vehicles. The vast area between the Malile and the Zambezi is inaccessible by vehicles as there is no bridge. 5.8.3 Other canals and waterways in the area Besides the six major canals that the Project focuses on, there are other canals which link settlements. These are the Mongu -Kalabo canal which starts at Mulambwa Harbour and is maintained by the Ministry of Transport, Works, Supply and Communication. The harbour is currently the second busiest harbour in Zambia after Mpulungu. With the establishment of an official border crossing at Sikongo, it is envisaged that there will more trade between Zambia and Angola. Hence, Mulambwa Harbour would be able to receive goods through the Kalabo/Luanginga waterway that ends up at Mulambwa Harbour. Currently in the absence of all -weather roads, the Mongu -Kalabowaterway is the only direct link between the west and east banks of the Zambezi River for now. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 64 5.8.4 Telecommunication In terms of telecommunication, it was observed that Mongu District has three major mobile phone companies providing services, namely ZAMTEL, MTN and Airtel. The services remain poor in some areas of the Floodplain due to the topographic constraints. In other areas like Lwatile, Nalusa, Matongo and Lealui networks can be accessed on higher ground such as mounds. 5.9 NOISE AND VIBRATION There are no data regarding noise and vibration in the Study area. However, there are no kn own sources of industrial activities in the Barotse plain. 5.10 FAUNA 5.10.1 Terrestrial and wetland species 5.10.1.1 Mammals LARGE HERBIVORE AND A QUATIC MAMMALS The following table presents the common mammals present in the Barotse floodplain according to the Wildlife Depa rtment in Mongu. However, herbivores such as the Zebra, Wildebeest and the Hyena were reported by local population to be absent from the eastern side of the Barotse plain . Such wildlife is common the Liuwa Plain National Park and likely to be present in th e West Zambezi Game Management Area , large terrestrial mammals found in the Barotse floodplain would most likely be immediately hunted by local population. The study area is not located in a migratory corridor for large herds of herbivores. Table 7 common mammals present in the Barotse floodplain according to the Wildlife Department in Mongu English name Scientific name Lozi name -final-zemaformat.docx / and Social impact Assessment for the impro ved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 65 English name Scientific trend Hyena Crocuta crocuta Sitongwani Least concern/decreasing The study area offers valuable habitats for water dependent mammals. During field visits carried out in September 2013, Hippopotamus and Spotted -necked Otters were observed (directly or through traces). Hippopotamus occupy riverine grassland along the Zambezi and otters occupy rivers and large perennial we tlands. The following table s summarize herbivores, aquatic mammals and habitat characteristics and assess their values. Level of intactness is also described in the next table, this will help in describing impacts in the next chapter. Level of intactness r efers to existing disturbances in the Study area. Three threshold levels are defined: Low, Moderate and High value components . Herbivores Explanation Ecological value of the study area for herbivores Low There is no large number of herbivores in the study area, since it is not a protected area. Also, human illegal subsistence hunting and poaching greatly limits the possible presence of such animals. The area is not a migratory corridor for any large mammals. Level of intactness of herbivore habitats Low The study area characteristic does not allow for human -large herbivore cohabitation (hunting, poaching, etc.). Aquatic mammals Explanation Ecological value of the study area for aquatic mammals High The Barotse floodplain is rich in wetland diversit y and riverine wetlands are home of a large number of Hippos. Perrenial wetlands are valuable habitat for otters. Level of intactness of aquatic mammals habitats High Riverine wetlands are difficult to access and human encroachment is limited to few graz ing and fishing activities. Perrenial wetlands, habitat of otters are not utilized by human and are not fragmented. SMALL MAMMALS According to Timberlake (1998) only few small mammals (insectivores, rodents) are present in the Barotse flood plain, probab ly due to regular fire, human depredation for food and the annual flood. Another explanation could come from the absence of trees and thickets limiting shelter for small mammal and increasing depredation by birds of prey (especially by the Black Kite , freq uently observed in the plain). The following table presents the small mammals potentially present in the study area. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 66 Table 8 Potential small mammals in the barotse floodplain English name Scientific name IUCN status The following table summarize s smal l mammals and habitat characteristics and assesses their values. Small mammals Explanation Ecological value of the study area for small mammals Low The Barotse flood plain does not offer many valuable habitats for small mammals, the lack of thickets and forest restrain their distribution. In the mean time they suffer from subsistence hunting. Level of intactness of small mammals habitats Low Small mammals in the study area occupy human anthropogenic habitats. BATS Regarding bats, Timberlake (1998) ha s noticed the attractiveness of wetlands for bats, especially when trees are present such as Dambos sites. In total, 26 species have been reported in the Barotse flood plain along the eastern edge of the flood plain during a two week survey in 1998 (Timber lake). Floodplain edge is planted with mango trees and a few native trees are present. Rotting fruits attract insects making it an interesting hunting ground for bats. Inside the floodplain, trees were bat can roost are rare and the few trees present are a round villages making bats prone to persecution, their diversity must be lower moving away from the edge. The list of observed species is in Annex 5. None of the species has a vulnerability status (IUCN, 2013). The following table summarize s bad and habit at characteristics and assesses their values. 5.

However, wetlands nearby the edge of the plain ar e the most valuable habitats for bats as they offer hunting ground and nearby mango trees and human structures offer shelters and food for bats Level of intactness of bat habitat Moderate Bats rely on anthropogenic structures for shelters (roofs, abando ned houses and building) and food (mangos). The quality of wetlands offer them a steady sources of insects. 5.10.1.2 Herpetofauna The Barotse being covered with wetlands and grassland is a habitat rich in herpetofauna biodiversity. According to Timberlake (1998), there are three categories of reptiles and amphibians: purely aquatic species, dependent on a certain permanent water level; wetland species, dependent on a certain level of humidity; savanna species, living on dry land and retreating with the floods. The Barotse floodplain has the richest aquatic/flood plain herpetofauna in the Zambezi basin with a total of 89 species with 3 species of terrapins/tortoises, 19 lizards, 4 worm -lizards, 30 snakes, the crocodile, and 32 species of frogs and toads (Timberlake, 1998). The complete list of species is provided in Annex 7. Water dependent reptile and amphibian are sensitive species in the study area. So far, the lack of mechanized agriculture, the lack of pesticide usage and the relative intactness of many wetlands have allow a great diversity of amphibians and reptiles to thrive. In the mean time, these species are very sensitive to change, being less mobile and dependent on water quality. Few information is available on life cycle of reptiles, some of them lay the ir eggs in November - December, eggs hatch in January -March. More information is available about amphibians: males start their calling songs when the rainy season starts (Timberlake, 1998) . The following table present the common herpetofauna species present in the study area according to the Wildlife Department in Mongu . English name Scientific name Lozi name Simbotwe 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 68 An endemic frog species with very limited range, the Mongu shovelnose frog ( Hemisus barotseensis ) is known from the site (Leonard, 1998). It is classified as \"data def icient\" from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since it has only recently been discovered, only a few specimens have so far been found and its population status is not clear (IUCN, 2014) . It has been recently described and, although its range has bee n delineated with limited information, it covers the study area and the species presumably occurs in Liuwa Plain and Lochinvar Parks (IUCN, 2013). This wetland species is a burrowing frog living most of his life underground . Eggs are deposited in a burrow, tadpoles are released when the nest floods toward the mud surface to water ( Channing & Broadley, 2002). Figure 14 Mongu shovelnose frog Hemisus barotseensis (source : Channing & Broadley, 2002) The following tables summarize wetland, aquatic and savanna species and habitat characteristics and assesses their values. Level of intactness is also described in the next table, this will help in describing impacts in the next chapter. Level of intactness refers to existing disturbance s in the Study area. Three threshold levels are defined: Low, Moderate and High value components . Aquatic and wetland species Explanation Ecological value of the study area for aquatic and wetland species High Wetlands and rivers are all highly valued habitat for herpetofauna (see wetland section) Level of intactness of aquatic and wetland species habitat /current issues /resilience level Moderate to high Riverine wetlands and perennial marshes are highly intact while wet grassland are moderately intact (see wetland section) Terrestrial species Explanation Ecological value of the study area for terrestrial species Low The study area offers vast grassland for terrestrial species. However, the annual flooding limits the number of species. Level of inta ctness of terrestrial species habitat Low Constant grazing and grassland fires, and human persecution greatly reduces the value of the study area for terrestrial species. 5.

Odonates such as damselflies and dragonflies are wetlands dependent and many species have been observed in the plain by the ESIA Expert. Some butterflies (Lepidoptera) are also wetland dependent. Timberlake (1998), has carried out Odonata and wetland Lepidoptera surveys in the Barotse floodplain. They are presented in Annex 8. Many wetland dependent insects find part of the life cycle linked to water. For example, Odonata lay their eggs cligging on leaves in the water and their larval stage takes place in the water. Wetland emergent plants are important for Odonata as they provide perches sites and sites where juvenile moult into adult. It has been estimated that to maximize Odonata diversity a buffer zone around wetland of 20 meters of ermergent wetland plant must be protected from destruction when implementing a Project ( Samways & Steytler 1996 quoted by Timberlake, 1998). Odonata are also very sensitive to wetland pollution from agricultural act ivities. Odonata population trend vary according to the annual flood, many species thrive at the beginning of the wet season, however when water overflows rapidly, many cannot survive fast flowing waters. Mating of Odonata has been observed by the ESIA Exp ert during the dry season, when emergent plant are fully available and water temperature adequate for eggs. However, very limited information has been found regarding sensitive periods of the life cycle of Wetland dependent butterflies. It seems that some wetlands dependent butterflies are at their butterfly stage in late spring early summer. Wetland dependent butterflies rely on host wetland plants as larval food such as the Polygonum, however, unlike Odonata their life cycle does not involve water. The following tables summarize wetland dependent insects and habitat characteristics and assesses their values. Level of intactness is also described in the next table, this will help in describing impacts in the next chapter. Level of intactness refers to ex isting disturbances in the Study area. Three threshold levels are used : Low, Moderate and High value components . Wetland dependent insects Explanation Ecological value of the study area for aquatic and wetland species High Wetlands and rivers are all hi ghly valued habitat for water dependent insects (see wetland section) Level of intactness of aquatic and wetland species habitat Moderate to high Riverine wetlands and perennial marshes are intact while wet grasslands are moderately intact (see wetland s ection). These habitats are the important for water dependent insects since they are occupied by tall grasses where Odonata reproduction and moult take place . Many wetland plant species are larval food source for butterflies. 5.10.1.4 Identification of species with special status According to Timberlake (1998), some species in the Barotse floodplain are rare, regional -endemic or have an IUCN protection status. The following table summarizes information of these species and describes their habitat requirements. Spec ies highlighted in grey are the only one that are really of concerns because of their very limited range, their IUCN protection status and because their habitat may be affected by the Project. 5.

It also studies fishery activities. Information regarding fishes and fisheries were provided by Gordon Mudenda, Fish expert. Three methods were used to study fish and fisheries that include literature review; site visits to the canals; and conducting structured interviews with key stakeholders fishermen operating in th e vicinity of the canals. There is limited published literature on the Upper Zambezi Fishery. Most of the documents reviewed are commissioned consulting study report for the Upper Zambezi Fishery. A site visit to the project areas was conducted from Septem ber 16th to September 21st 2013 during which all the canals that are designated for rehabilitation were inspected. During this period, discussions were also conducted with fisheries officials based in Mongu in order to get an impression with regard to what is taking place in the fishery. Interviews were conducted with fishermen operating in the vicinity of the canals at the following villages: Fisheries Even though Zambia is landlocked, fisheries are important for the national economy because of the relative abundance of water resources. Fishing also contributes significantly to employment and food production. Fisheries in Zambia contribute about 3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. Current estimates indicate that over three hundred thousand persons directly or indirectly obtain part of their income from the fisheries sector. Fish is a major food item in the diet of Zambia. According to the Central Statistical Office Living Conditions Survey 20 06, fish accounts for 29 percent of the animal protein supply. Fish is an important source of protein for the low -income group because of its relative affordability, in comparison with other animal protein sources such as beef, chicken and pork. In parts of the country without significant livestock, fish is often the only legitimate source of animal protein available . Annual fishery production in Zambia ranges between 65,000 to 70,000 tonnes , the upper Zambezi representing approximately 10% of Zambia fisher ies. (See Annex 3) Annual aquaculture produc tion in 2008 was 6,960 tonnes. Most natural fishery areas either are fully or overexploited, making it difficult to significantly increase fish production to meet the demands of increasing population now estimate d at 120,000 tonnes per year. FISHERIES OF THE BAROTSE FLOODPLAIN Fisheries of Zambia may be divided into three categories: major fisheries; minor fisheries; and fisheries of small water bodies. Major fisheries are: Bangweulu Lakes Upper Zambezi Floodplain. Minor fisheries include Lake Itezhi -tezhi; Lake Lusiwashi; and the Lower Zambezi. Fisheries of small water bodies include s everal small rivers; seasonal streams and small reservoirs scattered throughout the country. Aquaculture output could be considered as component under this category. The Upper Zambezi Fishery is one of the major fishery areas of Zambia. Its annual catch is usually ranked from third to sixth depending on catches from other fishery areas in a year . The Upper Zambezi Fishery is divided into five strata. This division is to facilitate collection of fisheries statistical data aimed at estimating total annual fis h catches : Stratum 1 is situated in the northern part of the fishery and covers areas around Lukulu. Stratum 2 covers the areas around Mongu and some parts of the stratum are in Kalabo district. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the B arotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 72 Strata 3 and 4 are located in Senanga district and Stratum 5 covers the Southern parts of the fishery, the area around Sesheke and Mwandi. This stratum lies on the boarder between Zambia and Namibia. The canals that were the main component of this investigation are located in stratum 2. The highest catches are r ecorded in stratum 2 of the fishery. This situation is considered to be influenced by the fact that this part of the Upper Zambezi has the highest population density. FISHING PRACTICES AND CRAFT According to observation during 2013 site visit and discuss ions with fishermen, fishermen on the Barotse Floodplains use the following fishing methods and gears: gill netting using nets of different meshes; beach seining at limes using shade material (locally known as sefasefa); hooks; traps; fishing baskets and a t times spears are used. The following fishing craft are used in the area and include dugout canoes; plank boats; fibreglass boats sometimes referred to as banana boats and metal boats . According to the Department of Fisheries, the importance of each type of fishing crafts in the Upper Zabezi Fishery is as follow. Table 10 Number of different types of fishing craft, fishing villages and fishermen between 1975 and 2012 Year Canoes (#) Plank boats (#) Fibre glass boats (#) Metal boats (#) Total number of boats Fishing villages (#) Fishermen (#) 2012 1,268 71 37 20 1,396 142 1,056 1996 1,359 - 9 - 1,368 270 1,225 1993 1,997 47 7 - 2,051 324 2,292 1987 2,618 1 9 2 2,630 400 1976 2,100 56 1 - 2,157 593 3,209 Source: Department of Fisheries: Reports of the Statistics Unit The dugout canoe is the most common fishing boat used in the fishery. Numbers of all types of fishing boats used in the fishery have decreased since 1976. There has also been a decrease in the number of fisherme n and fishing villages. Fish catches have however increased during the same period (see next section). This may show that fishermen have increased their efficiency over the period. Another explanation is that the Barotse fishery is highly seasonal and the number of fisher men that are surveyed during a frame survey depends on the period when they are enumerated. During the wet season, for instance, fishermen tend to abandon the fishing villages and camps as the floodplains are flooded. During the dry season , most fishermen return to their fishing camps. When the catches begin to decrease significantly, they slowly begin to leave the fishing camps . The following table shows the different types of fishing crafts per district in the Upper Zambezi Fishery.

Some parts of the fishery are more fished than others. Fishing pressure is largely influenced by the population size in a district and accessibility to urban markets. Senanga and Sesheke recorded highest numbers of fishermen and canoes. This could be attributed largely to how accessible fishermen operating in these areas are to urban markets. The small number of fishermen in Mongu is due to the small area of the floodplain in this district. The following table shows that between 1993 and 1996, the number of gill nets has al most triple in the region. This device causes decline in fish population as it enables fishermen to catch juveniles.

According to the records provided by the Department of Fisheries, gill nets are the most commonly used fishing gear in the fishery. However, other fishing gears, some of which are destructive and illegal are common in the fishery. Gill nets, baskets and seines fishing gears are illegal fishing equipment according to the Fisheries Act but are very common in the fishery as shown in the previous table . The 1996 frame survey indicated an increase in the number of commonly used fishing gears such as gill nets and seines. Between 1993 and 1996, total numbers of gill nets, seines, hooks and traps increased by more than 100 %. Such a drastic increase confirms that the increased number of catch per fisherman is caused by increasing numbers of fishing nets. The frame survey of 2011 (Department of Fisheries Frame Survey, 2011) results reveal that gillnets are still the major fishing gear used on the fishery and there are 14,804 gillnets of which 13,440 are currently being used. The highest number (57%) of these gillnets were recorded in Stratum 2, where most of the canals to be rehabilitated are located, followed by Stratum 5 with 27% while the lowest is Stratum 1 represented by 2%. The second popular gear on the fishery after Gill net is Seine net, while the least are b askets. 45% out of 14,804 gillnets are illegally used for fishing . The 2011 frame survey shows that fisher men on the fishery use gill nets with mesh size ranging from 1 mm to 5.5 mm. However , according to the Fisheries Regulations of 2012, Gillnet of a mes h size less than 3.0 inches (76 mm), monofilament ne t of a mesh less than 5.0 inches (127mm) are prohibited fishing nets in the Upper Zambezi fishery. Mech size has decreased causing over fisheries and higher catch of smaller juveniles and smaller species. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zamb ezi 74 Supply of fishing nets is generally regarded as a problem in the fishery as they are supplied by marketers. Baskets and seines fishing gears are illegal fishing equipment according to the Fisheries Act. The presence of high numbers of illegal fishing gear s show that management of the fishery is weak. In addition, programmes that are expected to collect data required for better management of the fishery are not implemented. There is need for collecting this type of data from the fishery from time to time or once every year. Resources made available to the Department of Fisheries seem inadequate to facilitate implementation of such a programme . CATCH The following table shows the estimated annual catch per boat and per fisherman. Table 13 Estimated total number of boats, annual catch, catch per boat and catch per fisherman Year Total Number of Boats Annual Catch (tonnes) Annual Catch per Boat Annual Catch per fisher men 2012 1,396 - - - 1996 1,368 Fisheries: Reports of the Statistics Unit According to the table, t here is an increase in the annual catch per boat from 2,779 tonnes in 1976 to 4,963 tonnes in 1996. This is largely due to decrease in the number of boats and fisher men during this period. The results also mean that the number of illegal fishing nets is on the rise. By combining data from the reported catch with the number of gill nets and seines n ets and the catch per year, it is obvious that over the years, the catch per net has considerably declined by a very large margin (see table below). This drop suggests over exploitation of the fisheries resources of the area. The large margins by which cat ch rates have declined should be of major concern to fisheries management. Table 14 Number of gill nets and seine nets combiend with an estimate of catch per net in a year Year Reported Catch Number of Gill Nets & Seines nets Catc h per net per year in kg 6,785 12,331 550 1993 9,240 5,897 1,567 Source: Chitembure 1998 The following table illustrates Fish species composition caught by fishermen ' gillnets by number and weight in the Barotse Floodplain.

The most important fish caught in term of weight are Clarias ngamensis , Tilapia rendalii and Oreochromis andersonii . The term SEASON Closing season to allow fish to mature is implemented from December to February. There are no fisheries in the plain at that time. SURVEY RESULTS This section presents the results of the interviews conducted and discussions conducted in the Barotse Floodplains in 2013 for the purpose of the ESIA . The main objective of the interviews conducted was to demonstrate the importance of the canals in relation to fishing . 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 76 Among the 14 fisher men that were interviewed, there was a wide range in the age groups. The youngest interviewed was 25 years and the oldest was 65 years old. The average age was estimated 47 years indicating that most of the fisher men have relatively long experience in the industry. The number of years of fishing ra nged from 2 to 36 with and average of 17 years. Most of the fisher men interviewed have spent most of their time fishing on the Barotse Floodplains only two have fished on other water bodies such as the Kafue Floodplains. It was also observed that none of the fisher men interviewed had a fishing license. In addition, they did not receive any short courses in fishing, offered by the Department of Fisheries. Fishermen obtain permission for their fishing operation from the local Induna. This is an indicator of the weaknesses in the current management system for the fishery. It is also an indicator that if the management of the fishery should work, the BRE should actively be involved in the formal management of the fishery. Most of the fisher men interviewed are c ompletely dependent of fishing for their livelihood. Only 6 out the 14 fisher men interviewed were involved in other activities which included: growing crops; rearing animals; producing charcoal; and selling groceries in fishing camps. The number of fisher men that were interviewed is relatively small to provide a true picture of what is taking place in the fishery. It is , however , clear that that farming is the main other source of livelihood. One fisher man interviewed was involved in farming crops and owns fifty head of cattle. A few fishermen were involved in trading and farming vegetables . All the fourteen fishe rmen that were contacted had illegal fishing gears in their possession, nets that are prohibited in the fishery. They had nets with small mesh siz es and in addition out of the fourteen interviewed, five had seine nets another fishing gear not recommended for use in the fishery. When asked to indicate the major problem in the area, fisher men point ed out that low fish catch rates was the most importa nt problem in the fishery. They also pointed out that prices offered by buyers for fish and theft of fishing gear are some of the problems in the area. Theft of nets is a problem mainly because most the areas that were surveyed were close to Mongu and easi ly accessible. The situation could be slightly different in remote parts of the area. Concerning the use of the canals by the fishing industry, all the fisher men interviewed gave similar responses. The canals are important for the fishing industry in the a rea for facilitating of fishermen to the fishing grounds and transporting the fish to the markets. Canals are also important in the fishery because traders are able to come to fishing camps in the area . According to interviewed fishermen, r ehabilitation o f the canals is not going to negatively impac t their fishing operations. Man y of them believe that the proposed rehabilitation of the canals is going to enhance their fishing operations and improve their livelihoods . CURRENT FISH ISSUES I N THE STUDY AREA In Barotseland, the natural resources are traditionally managed by the BRE. According to the law, some Governmental structures should have taken the responsibility for this management, but in fact the BRE still has a strong power. Regarding to environmental protection this traditional management has pro and cons. To keep the traditional land tenure system, the BRE strongly refuses to sell the land to any company or private investor. This system has prevented the implantation of any industries or large -scale farming activities in the area. By doing so, it has preserved the area from any major source of pollution or industrial environmental damage. The area is still in a relative good state, with few heavy infrastructures damaging the natural landscape. 5. Environmental Baseline Study p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 77 On the other hand, the enforcement of regulation on fishing and hunting is also ensured by the BRE. The Zambian Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) and the Fisheries Department are the Governmental institution supposedly in charge of this enforcement, but they have very l ittle power on the ground. The Indunas in charge of this enforcement do not have any budget to operate, so are very prone to corruption to ignore the fishermen using illegal gears. This situation led to poor enforcement of the regulation, with overfishing and the majority of the population doing illegal practices, like fishing with mosquito net. This uncontrolled situation has rapidly led to the depletion of resources and today fish stocks have reached a critical low point. 5.10.2.2 Fishes The Upper Zambezi, as is t he case with the rest of Zambia has three seasons: a hot dry season from August to October; a cool dry period from May to July and a rainy season from November to April. From September to November the Upper Zambezi has its minimum water level and the water s of the Zambezi are confined to the main river channel. High water levels are usually observed between March and May. The flood peak is usually recorded in April. The Upper Zambezi Fishery is a typical flood plain fishery. Spawning of the fish is normall y stimulated by the first rains and breeding of the fish takes place when water levels are rising. The high water levels provide an ideal nursery areas facilitating survival of larval and juveniles. During the flood, canals become channels to reach spawnin g grounds throughout the plain. Areas with emergent tall grasses are favoured. From March to May, the Barotse Floodplains are flooded. At the beginning of the flood, f ishes move from the Zambezi and Malile into wetlands and canals where they spawn. The hi gh floods offer protection to the growing fry in the fishery. This is therefore the period when the fish both juveniles and adults suffer little mortality from predation and fishing because of the protection from high water levels. The low water seasons i s classified as the sensitive period because during this period, fish es are confined to reduced water volumes. During this period of low water levels, predation can be considered to be high and fishing operations are more effective compared to periods of h igh water levels. In comparison with other fishery areas of Zambia, there has been little effort to investigate the fish biodiversity of the Barotse Floodplain. Fish species of the Barotse Floodplains were first described by Weiss in 1970. Other documents that provide a description of the fishermen of the Barotse floodplain include Sketon 1993, 2001 and SAIAB reports of 2002 and 2003. The Upper Zambezi fishery has rich fish diversity and one hundred and three species of fish have been recorded with Cichlids and Cyprinids contributing to the largest number of species. A list of fish species of the Upper Zambezi is provided in this report in Annex 2. Fishery areas in Zambia where fish species of the Upper Zambezi are found are also listed. Compilation of the list of fish species of the Upper Zambezi is based on Jackson (1961) Skelton (2001) and Utsugi and Mazingaliwa (2002). The following table presents the number of fish families in the Barotse flooplain based on Weiss (1970) and SAIAB (2002, 2003) and Skelto n (2001 ). Table 16 Number of fish species recorded from the Barotse Floodplains by family Family Number of species Percentage by Species number Mormyridae 6 5.83 Kneriidae 1 0.97 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 78 Family Number of species Percentage Species number 1.94 Schilbeidae 2 1.94 Total 103 Twelve fish families are represented in the Barotse Floodplain as indicated in the tabl e above with a total of 10 3 species of fish. Families with the largest number of species are Cyprinidis f ollowed by Cichlids. Other common species in the area belong to the families Mochokidae, Bagridae, Characidae and Claridae. Cyprinids are fish species associated with river environments and Cichlids prefer relatively calm waters . The complete list of species is provided in Annex 2. An observation that may be made by examining the fish composition of the Upper Zambezi Fishery is that the dominant fish fam ilies particularly the Cichlids are resistant and should be able to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as increased silt, turbidity and reduced oxygen concentrations. In fact, m ost species of the Upper Zambezi Fishery are also found in other maj or water bodies where water quality is of poor quality such as the middle and Lower Zambezi and the Kafue Floodplains . FISH HABITAT There has not been a fish sampling programme on the Barotse floodplains whose objective was to determine if the some species of fish prefer the canal environments compared to other habitat s of the floodplains. However, experience from other fish sampling programmes, indicate that river channels, with relatively fast flowing waters are poorly inhabited with fish. Fishes of such floodplains prefer lagoons with vegetation . -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 79 Table 17 Fish families and their habitat Presence in canal during the dry season Period of work Restriction Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec Fish Groups SSpawni ng High water Levels Low water levels Spawning Mormyridae (Snoutfishes) no Fishes of this family prefer calm and relatively deep waters.

Unlikely to be common in canals where vegetation has been removed Spawning High water level Low water le vel Spawning Cichlidae (Cichlids / Breams) no Cichlids prefer calm waters. They are thought to be the main species of African lakes. They are likely to be present in canals with slow moving waters Mastacembelidae (Spiny eels) no Lives in vegetation along margins of flowing rivers. Very rare species and unlikely to be common in canal systems.

It is considered that same species are present in the Upper sections of the Zambezi. Schilbeidae (Butter Catfishes / Silver Barbel) yes but not abundant Shoals in standing slow flowing open waters with emergent or submerged vegetation. Likely to be present in the study area but not abundant in canals. Critical period Sensitive period Less sensitive period VALUE OF THE CANALS F OR FISHES The ecological value of each canal relating to the fishery was assessed based on the number of fishing camps that a canal services and the size of the canal as well as the connection between the canal and natural rivers such as the Malile . From the fisheries perspective, and size of the canal , it was therefore considered that the Fisheries canal in its section connected to the Malile River is the most important fish habitat . The Lubitamei is considered the least important fish habitat . Studied canals are not important as spawning grounds, this can be explained because fishes of floodplain tend to prefe r lagoons that have emerging vegetation and this is not the case with most area of studied canals. The following tables assess ecological values of each canal. Level of intactness is also described in the next table, this will help in describing impacts in the next chapter. Level of intactness refers to existing disturbances in the Study area. Three threshold levels are used : Low, Moderate and High value components . 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 80 Fisheries canal Explanation Ecological value of Fisheries canal for fishes High The fishe ries canal is directly connected to the Malile river; therefore, it is an important fish habitat. Level on intactness of Fisheries canal for fishes Moderate The canal gets small towards the main lands and is silted on the eastern side . N'gombala canal Explanation Ecological value of N'gombala canal for fishes Low N'gombala canal is poorly connected to both the Malile and the Zambezi since it is not well maintained, this poor connection reduces the fish habitat quality of the N'gombala canal. Level on intactness of N'gombala canal for fishes Low Poor connectivity (siltation, etc.) and encroachment by cattle and farming activities has considerably degraded the potential fish habitat of the canal. Nebubela canal Explanation Ecological value of Nebubela canal for fishes High Along the Malile River, there are many perennial marshes with emerging vegetation that provide quality -spawning grounds in the Malile. Along the Zambezi, there are also highly valued spawning grounds. Level on intactness of Nebubela canal for fishes Moderate This fish habitat is affected by human activities being a navigable route close to Mongu, used by many boats and fishermen. However, the canal is in a relatively good state. Musiamo canal Explanation Ecological value o f the Musiamo canal for fishes Moderate during flooding period, low in the dry season Runs on the edges of the Barotse floodplains an area where there are few fishing camps. Many emergent leaved plant s in wetland s are spawning ground during the flood. However, the canal distance to natural water bodies gives it a limited value for spawning. During the dry season, there is no continuity of the canal with natural water bodies, reducing its ecological value. Level on intactness of the Musiamo canal for fishe s Low The edges of the floodplain are more heavily inhabitated, the canal has many impassable obstacles for fishes movement (small weirs, etc.) 5. Study \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 81 Libutamei canal Explanation Ecological value of the Libutamei canal for fishes Low For most part of the ye ar, the canal has no fisheries except for basket fisheries. During the time of the field visit, no fishe rmen camp was recorded in this canal. This area is , therefore , believed to be of low ecological value for fishes. Also, there is weak continuity of the canal with natural water bodies, reducing its ecological value. Interviews with local population have revealed that only \"bubble fishes\" are known to occupy Lubutamei and their numbers are declining due to lack of connectivity with nearby lakes. Level on intactness of the Libutamei canal for fishes Moderate Most parts of the canal are filled with sediments , many obstacles reduces the connectivity with lakes. Muoyowamo canal Explanation Ecological value of the Muoyowamo canal for fishes Low, especi ally close to Limulu nga This canal is mainly used for transportation between Lialui and Limulunga. At the time of the visit, there were a fishing camp near Lialui none was seen near Limulunga. The connection between the canal and the Malile River has many impassable obstacles for fish movement. This area is , therefore , believed to be of low ecological value for fishes. Level on intactness of the Muoyowamo canal for fishes Moderate In some section s, the canal embankments have collapsed and there are low wa ter levels which limits habitat quality for fishes Skelton (2001 ) describes the status of 33 species according to the IUCN Red List for freshwater fishes. None of the species indicated on this list are those present in the Barotse Floodplain. However, thi s does not mean that all species are of lest concern for conservation purposes. There are two possible explanations for this absence of species of special status : most fish species of the area are also present in other fishery areas particularly the Kafue Floodplains , such species that have a wide geographic distribution are unlikely to be endangered or threatened. Another reason could be that there has not been enough investigation and sampling to determine the true status of the species in the area . 5.10.2.3 Identification of species with special status None of the fish identified or observed in the Study area has a protection or UICN status. However, the Banded Neolebias ( Neolebias lozii ), a critically endangered fish (according to IUCN red list) , is present nea rby the Study area in two waterbodies: the Kataba River and its tributary the Siandra stream (right outside of Musiamo canal at its southern tip, 40 km south of Mongu see previous map ). It has not been observed elsewhere in the area, even though intensive sampling campaign were carried out (Tweddle, 2007 cited by IUCN, 2014). 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 82 Its habitat consists of small streams, in seasonally flooded plains and dambos, the species occurs under floating mats of vegetation and dense emergent vegetation. The species potenti al habitat range include the whole of Barotse floodplain (Tweddle, 2007 cited by IUCN, 2014). Where canal were dug on Kataba River, the fish disappeared from the canalized stretch of the River. Agriculture in the dambos also poses a threat to the species . Fertilizer and herbicides run -offs are also potential threat to the species. The previous map showi ng environmental sensitive area illustrate the Kataba River and Siandra stream, and a protection zone around the fish known habitat. According to World Bank terminology and the OP 4.04 Natural Habitat , this area is a critical natural habitat. 5.11 AVIFAUNA (BIRDS) This section describes birds species present in the Barotse flood plain. The study area is an important waterbird habitat, open grasslands, with many trapped fishes in wetlands, with few human settlements and a diversity of habitats is highly attractive for many waterbirds. COMMON SPECIES Over 740 bird species have been recorded in Zambia (Leonard, 1998). In the Barotse flood plain, there is one Importa nt Bird Area called \"Barotse flood -plain ZM006\". This IBA covers 600 000 ha. Key species of the IBA are presented in the table below.

Source: (Leonard, 1998 ), IUCN, 2013 The size of the Barotse flood plain enables it to support large numbers of waterbirds. As shown in the previous table, it ho lds the A4i criteria for several birds, as many congregations of birds represent more than 1% of their total population. The area becomes attractive for birds when water retrieves in June creating many wetlands. Among the waterbird present in the Zambezi flood plain, the African Skimmer, Great Snipe, Wattled Crane, Slaty Egret are considered threaten or vulnerable due to agricultural activities (burning fields), cattle grazing and poaching. Their population s are also decreasing (IUCN, 2013). 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 84 The nearby Liuwa Plain National Park is also an IBA ( ZM005 ) that offer similar wetlands habitats for birds. BIRD BEHAVIOR Timberlake (1998), has described 133 waterbird species in the Barotse flood plain among which 25 birds are palaeartic migrant meaning that they bre ed in the northern hemisphere in the northern summer (May -August) and spend the northern winter (October to April) in Africa as a non -breeding migrant . The list is provided in Annex 6. At the beginning of the flood (December), when shoreline habitat disap pears, waders such as plovers and sandpipers leave the Barotse flood plain, in the mean time palaeartic migrant s arrive, since they are not breeding in the flood plain, they are more tolerant to floods and can move out of the plain once the water level is too high. During the annual flood, bitterns, rails and flufftails are also present. Bird behavior in the plain is linked to the annual flood that dictates habitat loss due to drying -out or flooding. Some species concentrate around wetlands for foraging created by retrieved water in June, as the dry season settles many species disperse across the continent. Most birds , except for the African Skimmer , breed during the rainy season. The following table summarizes bird population and bird habitat character istics and assesses their values. Level of intactness is also described in the next table, this will help in describing impacts in the next chapter. Level of intactness refers to existing disturbances in the Study area. Three threshold levels are defined: Low, Moderate and High value components . Birds Explanation Ecological value of the study area for birds High Being an IBA, the site is highly valued for is great number of waterbirds. Level of intactness of bird habitats High Bird habitat is in fair ly good condition, the pattern of the annual flood is currently not negatively influenced by human construction, except locally by the road to Kalabo. Bird migration to the site is not threaten by human activity. 5.11.1 Field survey of bird species During field visit in September 2013, several water birds were regularly observed by the ESIA expert (Eric Deneut) as shown in the following table.

This section focuses on habitat as well as species value description . Ecological value of studied canals is presented in the Fish section. The St udy area does not have any protected zones or game reserve. It is, however, within the boundary of a RAMSAR \" Zambia Zambezi Floodplains \". In the study area, natural habitats are made of the following plant category: Herbaceous plants: facultative wetland plants: are plants that require a minimum level of wetness to grow, however they cannot tolerate to be all year -round with their feet in the water; obligate wetland plants: are plants that require year -round wetness, they can either be submerged aquatic p lants or emergent -leaved plants; terrestrial plants: are plants that will grow in well drained soil and sandy soils and cannot tolerate permanent wetness. Ligneous plants: shrubs and trees. Forests and thickets are almost absent of the Barotse flood plain due to the annual floods. Forest patches are present in the Luena flats on higher grounds. According to Timberlake (1998), there are 403 registered plants in the Barotse flood plain, among which: 92 are emergent -leaved plants (obligate wetland plant), and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 87 33 are submerged aquatic plants (obligate wetland plant), 14 are shrubs, 11 are trees Facultative wetland plants were not distinguished by Timberlake, however the vast majority of sedges are either obligate or facultative wetland plants. and sedges ( Cyperacea ) represent 45% of all plants species in the plain. In terms of ground coverage, tall grass and sedges cover the vast majority of the Barotse flood plain. Reeds (phragmites) and Papyrus (Cyperacea) are used by local population to buil d mats, fences and for tying in construction. According to Timberlake (1998), there are 21 obligated wetland Poaceaa (tall grass) species and 18 obligated wetland sedges species. Along canals , the fern Thelypteris confluens is very common, this plant is a good indicator of wetness. Diversity of ferns and allies (Pteridophyta) is very low in the Barotse flood plain due to the lack of shade. According to Timberlake (1998), there are only 7 species of ferns and one horsetail in the Barotse floodplain. Only 16 of all plants in the Barotse flood plain have a limited distribution range to the Zambezi catchment (4%). The majority of plants are found across much of the Afrotropics (incl uding East & West Africa), or pantropical (265 plants or 65%); 59 plants (15%) a re found over a large part of southern Africa (S outh Africa to S outhern Tanzania), the rest of the plants have unknown distribution ranges. Plants form associations that can be described as habitats. Wetland and t errestrial habitat s (drylands) are describe d in the following sections. The list of recorded plants in the Barotse flood plain is provided in Annex 4. The annual flood bring to the plain great changes to which wildlife have to adapt, many species abundance and wildlife composition fluctuate with this flood. The most mobile such as birds leave the plain when the flood covers it, others colonize new areas such as fishes and crustaceans in search of spawning grounds. The flood also kills many less mobiles species such as insects, small terrestrial re ptiles and small mammals. 5.12.1.2 Study limitations During the course of the Study, wetland assessment was carried out to delineate them and to assess their value in the Study area, this exercise was done for other components (birds, insects, etc.). However, due to the size of the Study area and the very vast surface area of wetlands and canals, no detailed surveys of plants and wildlife were carried out. Throughout the baseline and impact assessment, some uncertainties remain regarding location of these species. 5.12.2 Wetland species This description is based on the Wetland Specialist fieldwork carried out in September 2013, photo interpretation and bibliographical data. In the study area, two distinctive locations are commonly referred as wetlands: the Barotse flood plain directly west of Mongu plateau and the Luena flats where the Lubitamei canal runs (see map of the Study area). Both areas are in the Barotse flood plain. The flood plain occupies the lowest topographical position in the area. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Soci al impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 88 The Barotse flood plain i s delineated by the plains around the Zambezi River and its tributary rivers. It corresponds to the flooded area during the rainy season. In Mongu and K alabo this floodplain abruptly stops with rising plateau s. Luena flats is the area where many wetlands a re created by the end of Luampa River, a seasonal tributary of the Luena River, east of Lukulu. Luena River is a tributary of the Zambezi River. The entire Barotse flood plain is culturally and commonly considered a wetland since water cover its entire are a from January until May/June. The floodplain is also classified as a RAMSAR site since 2007 (RAMSAR site n\u00b0 1662 Zambia Zambezi Floodplains ). In a purely biological sense, is broadly accepted to be considered a wetland, an area that shows hydrophilic vege tation and/or hydromorphic soils. Whether the entire floodplain in inundated long enough to be considered a wetland in the biological sense is unknown and full wetlands inventories have never carried out (Timberlake, 1998). The Project's Wetland specialist has broadly defined wetlands in the Barotse flood plains with the following criteria: areas with actively -growing herbaceous vegetation observed in September (during the ESIA field visits) are to be considered wetlands. September being at the end of droug ht, any living grass at that time finds moisture form a steady water source. In the Study area many wetlands, in the biological sense, have been identified during ESIA field visits: Perennial marshes; Seasonal fore sts; Riverine grasslands; Dambos; Plateau lakes and their associated plains Most of these wetlands have a direct or indirect hydrological connection with several canals as shown in the Study area map. The following sections will study in depth all types o f wetlands. The map of the Study area, also shows valuable wetlands. PERENNIAL MARSHES Perennial marshes are year -round inundated wetlands. In these wetlands, water level is high enough to limit tall grass colonization to their margins. Usually these wetl and are located close to permanent rivers such as the Malile or Zambezi river, and show hydro -connectivity with them. These wetlands have been created by the progressive shifting of meanders of the Zambezi or Malile rivers, there are remnant meanders (also called oxbow lake). Part of fisheries, N'Gombala and Muyowamo are located close to perennial marshes. In some areas, canal banks are so degraded that they have evolved as perennial marshes with stagnant water (such as the N'gombala canal) . Water lilies occupy these wetlands as well as many tall grasses from the Poaceae family and sedges (Cyperaceae) such as the Cyperus papyrus . Papyrus is a good indicator of perennial marshes as it necessitates standing water all year -round. Due to their high water mark, these wetlands are not intensively used as drinking points by cattle and diverse wildlife inhabit their water. After the annual flood, when water retrieves, many big fishes are trapped in these wetlands attracting Spotted -necked Otters, Pied Kingfishers, A frican Pygmy - Kingfishers, Black and Little Egrets, etc. Other typical wetland birds and fish eating birds occupy these wetlands such as the African Jacana and the Copper -tailed Coucal. Social impact Asse ssment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 89 Spear fishing is common in perennial marshes during the dry season. The main target species is the large catfish Clarias gariepinus (Peel et al., 2013). Potential threats to these wetlands could come from severing their hydro -connections to rivers (earthworks, embankment, etc.) which feed wetlands with water. Pictures from top left to bottom right Spotted -necked otters, typical example of perennial marsh , Pied Kingfisher, -eater ( BRLi, September 2013) The following aerial photograph from Google Earth da ting October 2005, shows a good example of perennial marshes hydroconnected to the Malile River. 5.

Value assess ment is based on Expert's knowledge on the component, field surveys, etc. Value analysis does not take into account foreseen impacts, it is purely based on the component intrinsic value. Level of intactness is also described in the next table, this will he lp in describing impacts in the next chapter. Level of intactness refers to existing disturbances in the Study area. Three threshold levels are defined: Low, Moderate and High value components . Perennial marsh characteristics Explanation Ecological value High Although plant diversity is rather low, perennial marshes' quality, relate to their habitat feature for animals. These wetlands are high quality spawning grounds for fishes, thanks to their emergent vegetation and their hydro - connectivity with river s (Malile and Zambezi). Being connected to rivers, many fishes are trapped in them when water retrieves attracting fish eating birds and mammals. They create a buffer zone between terrestrial, human impacted areas and the rivers. Level of intactness High Due to their high water level, these wetlands are less utilized by grazing cattle and less impacted by human. Habitat is not fragmented and there is no source of pollution. Total approximate surface in the Study area An approximate surface of 40 274 ha between the Zambezi and the Malile has a high concentration of perennial wetlands. Wetland delineation was limited to the Study area, this wetland continues further outside the study area.

Water stays long enough to allow for colonization of hygrophilous plant species, usually their diversity is rather low and they are intensively used by cattle as drinking point which lim it uses by wildlife. Some plants are opportunistic settlers such as the Phragmites mauritianus and the Polygonum senegalense . These two plants use wetlands as starting point and can colonize drier areas. These plants are good indicators of seasonal marshes since they cannot tolerate high water level for long periods and are facultative wetland species. Birds such as the Blacksmith Lapwing , African Openbills , and Cormorants are very common in these wetlands. The main threat to these wetlands comes from inten se grazing and encroachment from cattle. Also being seasonal, these wetlands could be destroyed if not properly identified and delineated prior to activities and earthwork. Pictures from top left to bottom right Blacksmith Plover , African Openbills , colonization of Phragmites and Polygonum and intense grazing and encroachment of seasonal wetlands (September 2013, Deneut) The following aerial photograph from Google Earth dating October 2005, shows a good example of an isolated seasonal marsh. 5.

Seasonal marsh characteristics Explanation Ecological value Low Vegetation diversity is rather low , seasonal marshes offer limited habitat characteristics for wildlife since they are isolated. However, they represent good watering point for birds and bats Level of intactness Low These wetlands are intensively used by cattle as watering point. Local population also uses them for bathing, c lothes and car washing. Total approximate surface in the Study area The whole study area include scattered seasonal marshes, their total surface is unknown. Hydrological connection with studied canals None WET GRASSLANDS Wet grasslands are year aroun d inundated wetland with low water level (less than 60 cm) allowing for intense tall grass (Poaceae) colonization. In the study area , these wetlands are located far from rivers giving them a limited value for fish. They are found at the edge of the floodpl ain being fed by the seasonal flood, runoff from the plateau during the rainy season, from nearby natural water sources emerging out of the plateau foothills (seeps) as well as emerging water table . Localization of these wetlands, close to human settlemen ts along the edge of the floodplain has made them vulnerable. Along Musiamo, many agricultural land were reclaimed from these wetlands (i.e.: rice fields in the Sefula area) and canals web were dug to drain them toward the Musiamo canal. 5. Environmental Baseline Study \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 93 In the Luena fla ts, this type of wetland follows loosely the Lubitamei canal; soil in this area is not peaty. Along Libutamei, wetlands reclaimed their space over agriculture lands due to degradation of the canal drainage function. The bubble fish is the only fish present , it used to spawn in the wetlands and the Lubitamei , however according to villagers they are declining due to lack of connectivity between the Plateau Lake and the wetlands along Lubitamei. These wetlands intense tall grass coverage does not allow much wi ldlife to thrive, however they are valuable habitats for herpetofauna and small passerine birds. Typical plants are in the Poaceae, Typhaceae and Cyperaceae families. The presence of large colonies of Drosera madagascariensis , a small carnivorous plant, an d the deep dark organic soil indicate the presence of peaty soils (the depth of peat deposition was however not assessed during baseline studies). Peat soils are important micro climate regulators cooling and moisturizing the air at ground level alloying f or amphibians such as salamanders to thrive. Peat soil are important store of soil carbon and sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and are sources of atmospheric methane. The sequestering function of peat bogs for carbon dioxide outweigh the release of meth ane, peat bogs are therefore net GreenHouse Gas sink (International Peat Society, 2014). In Zambia, the estimated coverage of peatland is between 11,060 km2 and 12,201 km2, making it the African country with the most peat lands ( Page et al., 2010). The extent of peatland in the whole Barotse is unknown. Looking at different soil maps do not reveal the presence of peat, making it difficult to assess the extent. The most important current threat to wet grassland is the burning of peat soil to fertilize the s oil (by releasing phosphorus) and to reduce its acidity. However, this practice is not only detrimental to the wetland but also is not sustainable since peat can retain great quantity of water, removal of peat creates water logging which lead to abandonmen t agricultural activity.

Peat soils are also GHG sinks. Spawning activity is limited in this area due t o the remoteness from the Malile and the Zambezi. Moderate in the Luena flats (along Libutamei) These wetlands offer good quality habitat for herpetofauna. Vegetation is less diverse that its Barotse counterpart. Spawning activity is limited in this area due to the isolation from the Malile and the Zambezi. Bubble fish present in Plateau Lake s used to spawn in these wetlands , however according to villagers they are declining . Level of intactness Moderate These wetlands are impacted by agricultural activi ties and burning of peat deposits as they are located close to villages at the edge of the plain. Thanks to low use of fertilizers and pesticides in the area, pollution is limited. Drainage to Musiamo and Lubitamei affects and fragmentizes these wetlands, however some areas remain relatively intact. Total approximate surface in the Study area In the Barotse floodplain : 2 986 ha. Wetland delineation is limited to the Study area, this wetland continues further South In the Luena flats : 4 764 ha. Wetland d elineation is limited to the Study area, this wetland continues further North Hydrological connection with studied canals Lubitamei and Musiamo RIPARIAN FORESTS Riparian forests are very rare in the study area since populations have extensively cleared them propably to replace them with mango trees. However, some unwelcoming riparian forests remain thanks to their swampy appearance and their difficulty of access. Other are protected and valued by local villagers such as the one in Namushakende ( see map of the Study area). According to Timberlake (1998), Namushakende riparian forest is occupied by . Some valued ferns are also present such as the climbing fern Lygodi um microphyllum and the royal fern, Osmunda regalis . A few pineapples are underplanted in these forests. During the field visit by the Wetland Specialist, only two riparian forests were identified, one in Namushakende and one in Walenga. Water clogging has created the riparian forest in Walenga , thanks to poor drainage and poor maintenance of canals and culverts . Other few areas along the edge of the plain show good potential for presence of such forest s, however mango tree plantation has, throughout histor y, replaced almost all riparian forests in the Barotse floodplain. Threats to riparian forests could come from the Project itself, if any culvert and bridge are improved and drainage of Musiamo reestablished, some of them could be affected. 5.

Riparian forest characteristics Explanation Ecological value High Riparian forests are rare in the study area; shade from the canope and constant humidity from the soil allows many plants to thrive. Trees present in these forests are locally rare. Level of intactness Low These wetlands are remnant forests reduced to small isolated patches, mango tree plantation have replaced riparian forest. Pineapple plantation has affected the non - ligneous diversity.

This type of wetland is a continuity of the river's bed where bank are not well defined. species (Timberlake, 1998), plant dive rsity is rather low since it is limited by the high water level. These wetlands are highly valued for their role in offering spawning grounds for many fish species and feeding grounds for hippopotamus . This type of ecosystem is absent along studied canals. A few riverine grasslands along the Zambezi, where water level is not too high, are grazed by cattle. Example of riverine grassland along a branch of the Zambezi River (Septemer 2013, Deneut) The following aerial photograph from Google Earth dating S eptember 2009 , shows the dense riverine grassland at the Zambezi Rivers (in green). The following table summarizes riverine grasslands characteristics and assesses their values . 5.

Level of intactness High These wetlands are only accessible by canoe. Being the first area to flood during the rainy season, human encroachment is li mited to fishermen and few grazing areas. The habitat is not fragmented. Total approximate surface in the Study area 1778.4 ha , this type of wetland continues outside the Study area all along the Zambezi River Hydrological connection with studied canal s N'gombala, Fisheries DAMBOS Dambos are broad valleys that are waterlogged for some months during the wet season, they are fed by rain water or sometimes by ground water . The high water table, with little lateral movement, causes anaerobic conditions in the subsoil, thus precluding most woody species (except for underground dwarf trees called geoxylic suffrutices. Underground trees are dwarf ligneous plants where the above ground flowerings shoots only live for a short period of time and die during droug hts. The vegetation consists of grassland with scattered termitaria (Timberlake, 1998 ). Dambos are moisture -determined habitats, however in some cases water does not stay long enough to allow hygrophilic plant to thrive these are non -wetland Dambos. Dambos geomorphology differs from rivers as they do not form bed channels. The dry heads of dambos are invaded by pioneer woodland species such In the Study area, some wetlands could fit the definition of Dambos. They drain plateau lakes. One Dambo is located along the Lubitamei in its lower reach. This Dambo is covered by grasses such as Sedges and Poacea, grass biodiversity is rather low. In dryer a reas, termitaria cover the area. According to local populations, it used to be covered by agricultural plots. Dambos are valuable fish habitat when they are connected with natural rivers and, in the case of the Study area, they are of Moderate ecological v alue due to previous agricultural activities. The following aerial photograph from Google Earth dating May 2013 shows dambos in the Study area. 5.

These lake and their associated plains are wetlands. Many of these plains are drained into the Lubitamei canal. These wetlands are not dependent on the annual flood. Being out of the scope of study of this Project and since they will not be directly affected by canal improveme nt, their ecological values have not been assessed . However, some of these lakes being indirectly connected to studied canals may undergo drainage due to canal drainage improvemet. This issue was raised during the third workshop and is dealt with in the im pact assessment section. The map of the floodplain shows the most important plateau lakes and their associated plains.

This site covers 900,000 ha. A bite more than half of its size is occupied by th e Barotse floodplain. The Ramsar criteria for the Zambezi floodplain are as follow (source Information Sheet): Criterion 2: A wetland should be considered internationally important if it supports vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered species o r threatened ecological communities. Criterion 3: A wetland should be considered internationally important if it supports populations of plant and/or animal species important for maintaining the biological diversity of a particular biogeographic region. Criterion 4: A wetland should be considered internationally important if it supports plant and/or animal species at a critical stage in their life cycles, or provides refuge during adverse conditions. Criterion 6: A wetland should be considered international ly important if it regularly supports 1% of the individuals in a population of one species or subspecies of waterbird. Criterion 8: A wetland should be considered internationally important if it is an important source of food for fishes, spawning ground, n ursery and/or migration path on which fish stocks, either within the wetland or elsewhere, depend. Criterion 9: A wetland should be considered internationally important if it regularly supports 1% of the individuals in a population of one species or subspe cies of wetland -dependent non -avian animal species. According to the Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands, one of the main threat to wetlands within the Ramsar site is dredging of canals. Zambia Wildlife Authority is the management authority of the Ramsar site. The Ramsar delineation as shown in the figure below does not include wetlands along the Libutamei canal, as well as some of the Plateau Lakes north of Mongu. 5.

Outside of wetland habitats and few patches of forested areas, the study area has low plant diversity. Grazing of cattle, grassland fires to improve pastures, and wood clearing affects the floodplain plant diversity. TREES OF THE PLAIN In the Barotse flood plain, trees are scares and rare due to the constant seasonal flood. There is no forest in the flooded area, therefore only patches or individual trees play an ecological role. Mango (Mangifera indica ) is very common especially at the edge of the flood plain. Apple -ring Acacia (Faidherbia albida ) grows mostly on elevated sites such as vi llages. All other indigenous species are occasional to rare. They include Syzygium cordatum, - season islands, such as Lealui, have a greater variety of planted species (Timberlake, 1998 ) Apple -ring Acacia with weaver nests and Acacia in the Barotse flood plain (BRLi , 2013) The following table summarizes flood plain trees characteristics and assesses their values. Leve l of intactness is also described in the next table, this will help in describing impacts in the next chapter. Level of intactness refers to existing disturbances in the Study area. Three threshold levels are defined: Low, Moderate and High value component s. Trees of the plain Explanation Ecological value Moderate Trees in the flood plain do not form forest or corridors limiting their functions for terrestrial wildlife. However, being so rare, their role for roosting and hunting by bats are important. Many passerine birds use trees and thickets for nesting and as shelter. Level of intactness Low Most trees in the plain are planted (in villages) or affected by clearing for fuel wood. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambe zi 104 CHANNEL BANKS In areas where river or channel banks are well defined and higher than the normal water level , many facultative wetland species such as Phragmites mauritianus and the Polygonum senegalense and terrestrial plants plants as the diversifolius, Urena lobata (Malvaceae) are also present (Timbe rlake, 1998 ) In some areas, s and bars are formed along rivers bank such as the Zambezi and the larger tributaries. They are 1998 ). Phragmites extensively colonize sand bars . These sand bars being quickly drained are not wetlands in a biological sense. They represent habitat for many shoreline birds such a s waders such as plovers and sandpipers but also the African Skimmer (IUCN Near Threaten species). The following aerial photograph from Google Earth dating October 2010 shows an example of channel banks with a few sand bars. 1-3: sand bars Channel b ank along the Malile River (BRLi , 2013) The following table summarizes channel banks characteristics and assesses their values. 5.

Howeer, there are breeding sites for the African Skimmer (IUCN Near Threaten species). The sandy substrate only offers limited opportunities for plant and their diversity is rather low. Level of intactness Low Erosion and cattl e encroachment affects channel banks. GRASSLAND SAVANNA The large strip between the wet grasslands at the toe of the plain slopes and the wetlands associated with the rivers (perennial marshes, riverine grasslands) lies a vast grassland savanna intensivel y grazed and where the majority of villages are located . Grassland savanna are flooded during the rainy season, however they are probably the first areas were water retrieve. During the dry season, grassland savanna s are not fed with water and quickly become dry. According to Timberlake (1998), pasture weeds occurring on the Plain include Lantana camara , Senna occidentalis and Tribulus terrestris . The following aerial photograph from Google Earth dating October 20 06 shows an example of grassland savanna i n the Barotse floodplain. 1: Riverine and perennial wetlands; 2: Grassland savanna; 3: Wet grassland; 4: Plateau 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 106 Savannah grassland in the Barotse floodplain (left) and Lunea flat (right) (BRLi , 2013) The following table summarizes savann as characteristics and assesses their values. Grassland savanna Explanation Ecological value Low The nature of this ecosystem does not allow for high biodiversity (lack of water, etc.). Being constantly grazed, these grassland are not spawning grounds d uring the floods. Level of intactness Low Constant grazing and regular fire limit the level of intactness of this ecosystem. This area has higher population density than other areas in the plain. 5.12.4 Aquatic plant species All plant identified in canals are wetland species, see previous section. 5.12.5 Identification of species with special status According to Timberlake (1998), some species in the Barotse floodplain are rare, regional -endemic or have an IUCN protection status. The following table summarizes infor mation of these species and describes their habitat requirements. Species highlighted in grey are the only one that are really of concerns because of their very limited range, their IUCN protection status and because their habitat may be affected by the Pr oject.

Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 108 CONCLUSION ON ENVIRON MENTAL BASELINE The Barotse flood plain with its annual flood has allowed the creati on of wetlands habitats that are valued for many wildlife species including fishes. Only few human settlements are present in the plain, which has help to preserve many habitats, population concentration along the edge of the plateau has however created en vironmental pressure of nearby wetlands. The study area is poorly occupied by herbivores, probably due to high incidence of subsistence hunting by local population. In fact, large mammals are believed to be totally absent of the eastern side of the Barotse plain. Bird presence in the plain are adjusted to the annual flood pattern, with receding water many wetlands are created that allows for great flocks of birds to forage. When the dry season is at its peak, many seasonal wetlands disappear and bird popula tion decrease or concentrate along perennial wetlands and the rivers. Between the Zambezi -Malile area, with high density of wetlands, and the wet grassland along the edge of the plateau lies a large strip of grassland savanna. This area is more occupied by human, with settlements and grazing cattle. It is the area with the lesser environmental value. In the plain trees are scares and there is no forest, the main reason being the annual floods. Along the edge of the plateau, riparian forests have been extens ively replaced by mango tree culture leaving only few relictual riparian forests. In terms of plant species with special status, the area is not rich neither in endemicity nor in protected species. A few waterbirds have a special status, as well as other wetland dependent insects and amphibians such as the Mongu shovelnose frog. Fishes are specialized in slow moving and turbid water as found in canals. Important spawning grounds are located in riverine wetlands along the Zambezi and perennial wetlands cl ose to the Malile. Fishes spawn in their emergent -leaved grasses. The following tables sums up all components value and level of intactness in the Study area. Highly valued component are all linked to wetlands and their habitats for wildlife. The value ass essment will be used to analyze intensity of impact in the impact assessment section.

The history as presented by Indunas is that canal development was first initiated by King Lewanika around 1885 after the civil war based on his economic plan for agricultur e, fisheries, transportation in order to ensure the kingdom's food security. Records at Nayuma Museum verified this information. The canals are reported to have been constructed using compulsory labour. Table 24 History of the six t arget canals Name of Canal History Lubitamei The name means 'passing water'. It runs from Kala to Tembo. The canal is known as Kembe where it originates.The canal is believed to have been dug during the reign of King Lewanika (1885 -1916) Musiyamo The nam e means to \"lean against the edge\" and was built in the 1930s. It runs from Lukulu to Senanga. Muoyowamo Constructed between 1887 and 1889during the reign of LubosiLewanika, it was meant to link Lealui and Limulunga and to supply water to Lealui. The cana l was constructed using communal labour. The government has been maintaining the canal since 1964. N'gombala&Nebubela Named after LitungaN'gombala, the canal was constructed by government in 2002 using communal labour with the sole purpose of linking Kam a and Mongu. Fisheries Constructed by the Fisheries Department in 2004 for fish breeding purposes. 5.13.1 Lealui, Limulunga, Libonda and Nalolo Palaces Within the Barotse floodplain,many sites of cultural importance and interest are found. Sites of cultural imp ortance include palaces such as Lealui (summer capital of the Litungas), Limulunga (the winter capital for the Litungas), Libonda (summer capital of Chieftainess Mboanjikana) and Nalolo (summer capital of ChieftainesMakwibi). Makono village plays another i mportant role in the Barotse Kingship succession as the enthronement of a new Litungabegins here.Makono is regarded as the place where the first Litunga, Mbuyawamwambwa is buried. These areas are regarded as important and play significant roles in the Baro tse Kingdom. Nayuma Museum in Limulunga is part of the national heritage of the country as it houses traditional relics connected to the installation of the Litunga. Lealui was a political and administrative centre where the signing of the Lockner Concessi on took place, a treaty between King Lewanika and the British South African Company (BSA), under which the Lozi Kingdom became a British Protectorate in 1890. 5.13.2 Royal Burial Sites (Sitinos) According to Lozi culture and custom, each Litunga chooses his buria l site as soon as he ascends to the throne. The graves link the past and present generations. The dead Kings are consultedthrough offerings of meat and libations with the grave attendants (Li Ng'omboti) as medium. During the Kuomboka, the Li Ngo'mboti sees off the royal barge (Nalikwanda) as it sails to Limulunga.An important significance of the BarotseFloodplain is its usage asburial grounds for the Lozi Kings (Litungas) as records from Nayuma Museum show. The graves of past kings, called Sitino, are manag ed and conserved byLi Ng'omboti.Ling'omboti act as Priests between the dead Kings and the communities in the Barotse Flood Plains. The graves are within the perimeters of the respective villages and they are not inundated during the floods. 5. Environmental Baseline Study p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 111 The graves are doted around the Barotse plain in different villages along the eastern bank of the Zambezi River that do not get inundated during the floods except for that of Lewanika II whose Sitino is in Sikongo on the west bank. Except for the Lake Nakatondo -Wa-Situlu site,damaged during the construction of the Mongu -Kalabo road, all the burial sites are in reasonable condition. MBUYUWAMWAMBWA BURIAL SITE This site is located in Makono village on the western side of the Zambezi River near Nanjulwe Island. Mbuyuwamwamb wa, who founded the Lozi Kingdom, abdicated the thronein favour of her son Mboo Muyunda, the first male rulerto have used the title Litunga. The title means \"King of the Land\". MBANIKELAKO BURIAL SITE This is the burial site for Litunga Lubosi Lewanika.Th e site is located in the middle of a village compound. King Lewanika ruled the Barotseland during the time when colonialism and the Frank Lochkner Concession were being implemented in Central and Southern Africa and he also ruled Barotseland when the then North -Western Rhodesia was being administered from Lealui. He ruled from 1878 to 1884 before he was briefly deposed then reinstated in 1885 until his death in 1916. OTHER BURIAL PLACES Having described the best -known burial sites, the table below presents other burial sites (Sitinos) for all the past Litungas for ease of reference. Table 25 Past Lozi Kings and their burial sites Name of Litunga Reign Burial Site/village Mbuyawamwambwa No record Ndowana The villages were the Litungas are buried have a very significant role in the Lozi society and the Ng'omboti (Grave Care Takers) has a lot of inf luence within the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE). 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 112 5.13.3 Lwatile Church Francois Coillard, the French Missionary belonging to the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society (PMS) built Barotseland's first church at Lwatile near Lealui in 1893. The Church, though in disrepair, still stands and remains one of the most memorable cultural relics in the Bartose Flood Plain. The church played a fundamental role in the establishment of educational institutions at Sefula and other areas of Western Province. Coillard is reput ed for having brought Christianity to Barotseland, helped to abolish witchcraft and slavery in accordance with the spirit of the Frank Lockner Concession of 1890.It is an accepted fact that African education in Zambia started in Western Province as evidenc ed by the schools built by the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society around 1890. In the history of Barotseland, Lwatile Church stands out as one of the historic architectural buildings/structures in Western province including the Old Boma site described be low. 5.13.4 Old Boma Site The old Boma site was another significant cultural site in Barotseland that has been a part of Lozi History. The Frank Lockner Concession was signed at this site in 1890. Frank Lochner was the representative of the Britsh South African C ompany owned by Cecil Rhodes. The concession provided protection to King Lewanika from an internal power struggle, the Portuguese and Arab slave traders. Through this Concession, Queen Victoria of England stationed a representative in Lealui (Mainga and Mu tumba, 1973). Sir Robert Thorne Corydon was the first representative of Queen Victoria in Barotseland in 1897 and he set up the Old Boma on the outskirts of Lwatile Mission before shifting the Boma to Kalomo in 1905. Reccords show that the Old Boma Site, l ocated near Lwatile Church, was the first Capital of North -Western Rhodesia. In the recent past, the site has been taken over as a residential area and has therefore lost its historic significance. 5.13.5 Lealui Royal Palace and village Litunga Lubosi Lewanika es tablished Lealui, the summer capital and home to the Nayuma sacred site, in 1878. There is a palace known as Kwandu that was built in 1890, a probation centre called Kamona built in 1878 anda visitor's pavilion. The probation centre serves as a waiting hou se where a newly installed Litunga waits to receive instructions before occupying the royal palace.The royal pavilion, the Kashandi was built in 1908. The materials used for the construction of the royal compound were sourced from every part of the Kingdom including the west bank of the Zambezi River. There is a Queen's residence, called Nanda, which was builtin 1906. Adjacent to the Queen's residence is another royal pavilion, the Njimba, where she receives her dignitaries and guests. To the east of the ro yal compound are houses for the King's children and Kingdom officials such as the Ngambela (Prime Minister). 5.13.6 Survey on cultural heritage sites During social surveys, villagers were asked if they were aware of any physical cultural resources (PCR). Their an swers are shown in the following table. 5.

In this section the terms \"local communities\", \"Project Affected People (PAP)\" and \"vill agers\" all designate people that live in the Study area and that will be affected positively (or negatively) by the Project. LITERATURE REVIEW The consultants first reviewed documents collected in both Mongu and Lusaka in order to obtain a detailed underst anding of the Study area. Documents reviewed included anthropological writings about the Lozi people, Barotse Jurisprudence and The Barotse Economy by Professor Max Gluckman; writings of Francois Coillard, the French Missionary of the Paris Missionary Soci ety (PMS); Central Statistical Office (CSO), Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Community Development and Social Services publications; and Concern WorldWide -Mongu Office data on canal rehabilitation works. Other documents reviewed w ere Environmental Guidelines for Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance works (RDA, 1997). FIELD VISITS TO THE P ROJECT AREA TO BE AF FECTED During field visits, data was collected through observations and interviews with stakeholders around the six target cana ls, namely, Fisheries, Lubitamei, Musiamo, Muoyowamo, and N'gombala to establish their usage and state. A checklist focusing on housing, water supply, road infrastructure, education facilities and services, health facilities and services and socio -economic profile was prepared and used during the survey by the consultants. As much as possible efforts were made to take pictures of the socio -economic activities and infrastructure available in the Barotse Flood Plain. The process promoted inter -sectoral linkag es between various government departments in the project areas, in addition to ensuring full participation of affected stakeholders and interested parties in the project areas. 5. Envir Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 115 SOCIAL SURVEYS Open -ended discussions were held with key informants who include d people living in the floodplain, farmers, fishermen, fish traders, and members of staff of selected government institutions and Non - Governmental Organizations within Mongu District and the newly created district of Limulunga. A series of spontaneous scop ing meetings were held with people living along the six target canals. Focus group discussions along the six major canals were held with groups of the key stakeholders ranging from 5 to 30 people depending on the village size. Fifty -five (55) villages were covered during the focus group discussions as presented below: ey, scoping meetings were held with groups of people from the local communities along the selected six major canals to be rehabilitated. These people are likely to be directly or indirectly affected by the proposed rehabilitation works. Consultations were also held with district technical staff and local administrators of the project area. Issues of focus in the consultations involved people's views, fears and expectations. The method adopted for community and stakeholder consultations was open -ended discu ssions based on a checklist. The goals of these social surveys were to present the Project to communities and to gather their opinions regarding canal current states and canal maintenance needs. Meeting with local communities has also enabled the Consultan t to describe the socio -economic baseline of the study area including the gender aspects, sources of livelihood, community's challenges, youth challenges, etc. Minutes of focus group discussion are presented in Annex 1. STUDY LIMITATIONS During the social survey period, 30th November early 2014, it was practically impossible to reach some of the points of the six targeted canals due to heavy rains. The social survey team only managed to visit settlements along the Lubitamei, N'gombala, Musiamo and Muoyowamo canals but failed to traverse the whole length of the Fisheries canal as the road was flooded and slippery. However, major findings of the survey are presented in this report. 5. Environmental Ba seline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 116 5.14.1 Population The Lozi ethnic group have been living in the Barotse Plain since t heir migration from the Kola Kingdom in the now Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the 1600s. Queen Mwambwa led them out of Congo. Upon Mwambwa's death, her daughter, Mbuyuwamwambwa, became queen and after her death, her son Mboo Muyunda ascended to th e throne as first King (Litunga). Mboo expanded the Lozi kingdom by conquest. During the 18th Century, the fourth Lozi King, Ngalama, initiated the process of unification, which was completed by Mulambwa, the 10th Litunga. Lozi historians, including missio naries and anthropologists such as Francois Coillard and Professor Max Gluckman, report that the Lozi people have inhabited the Barotse Plain for a long time and that about 1830 civil war broke out following the death of Litunga Mulambwa. Shortly after the civil war, the Sotho - speaking Makololo from the Bafokeng region of South Africa led by Sebitwane, invaded Barotseland and conquered the Lozi. The Makololo ruled Barotseland from 1840 until 1864 when they were over - thrown following a Lozi revolt led by Sip opa Lutangu, the 12th Litunga. This important chapter in Lozi history is preserved in the Nayuma Museum archives at Limulunga as part of the National Heritage Commission data bank. Lozi is the common language spoken in much of the Barotse Flood Plain, alth ough some inhabitants speak other Bantu languages as well. Lozi is a Bantu language of the Benue -Congo Family, within the larger Niger -Congo Group. The Lozi language is largely derived from the Sotho language spoken by the Kololo although it exhibits some modifications in phonetics and vocabulary. The distribution of human settlements in the Barotse Floodplain is influenced by natural resource availability (water bodies for fishing, water for human and livestock use, land for agricultural use, settlement an d grazing), accessibility and flooding pattern. Settlements/villages are clusters of households whose members are related. These settlements are usually located on higher ground near to fishing bodies' and ample land for livestock grazing and growing crops . In the study area, population repartition fall in three categories according to topographical characteristics: Floodplain people, Plain fringe people, Plateau people. The majority of people that depend on the floodplain as sources of livelihood live in the plain fringes close to the Musiamo canal. This population does not have to migrate during the flood; however water inundates most of the land in front of their villages restraining access to some of their sources of livelihood as they are mainly loc ated in the plain. Most of people living on the Plateau do not depend on the plain for their sources of livelihood, except for those working at Mongu Harbour. According to the 2010 Census of Population and Housing, the population density for Western Provi nce was 7.1 persons per km2 an increase in density of 1.0 person per km2 from 2000. Mongu is the most densely populated district with 17.8 persons per km2 with Kalabo with 7.1, Kaoma and Senanga with 8.1, Lukulu with 5.3, Sesheke with 3.4 and Shang'ombo wi th 6.5 persons per km2. The table below shows population distribution in the Study area, part in Mongu District, part in Senanga District. For district boundaries see map of the Study area. Based on this table it is obvious that the male population is lowe r in the Barotse floodplain than women. This population pattern is found across Zambia, in both rural and urban areas (2010 Census of Population and Housing). 5. Environmental Baseline Stud y Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 117 The 2010 Census of Population and Housing estimates that 86.3 percent of the provincial populatio n lives in rural areas, a similar proportion as in 2006 at 86.0 percent. This means that there is no significant migration of youths from rural areas including the Barotse Floodplain to urban areas. This is confirmed by information generated from focus gro up discussions that show that the few young persons who have left villages are those pursuing post -secondary education. However, there is a reported temporary migration into the floodplain by fish traders and upland inhabitants who have access to agricultu ral land between the months of August and December. SEASONAL MIGRATION During the dry season, the bulk of local production, economic activities and settlement are focused in the floodplain area. As the plain becomes inundated, most of the population moves to the uplands and plain fringes. This annual relocation of people and cattle including the Litunga in a highly - celebrated ceremony has become a national and international tourism event. There is a seasonal migration of the cattle owners living in the plai n. Cattle usually graze in the plain, but owners have to bring the herd to the upland during the flood. At this moment, there is grass on the upland thanks to the rains. The cattle are kept by people in the upland who receive payment in milk and calves fo r this service. A strong relationship is built between cattle herder from the plain and upland, through this system. This system is called \"mafisa\" in Lozi Table 27 Population distribution in the Study area (District, Constituency a nd Ward level) Constituency & Ward Number of Households 2010 Population Percentage Distribution Male Female Total Male Female Mongu Eric Deneut Environmen tal and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 118 Constituency & Ward Number of Households 2010 Population Percentage Distribution Male Female Total Male Female Silowana 1,326 of Population and Housing. * Both Districts have other constituencies outside of the Study area. 5.14.2 Growth rate, population density and distribut ion There has been a marginal increase in the population of Mongu district in the 20 -year period between 1990 and 2010 as shown by census data. In 1990, the population of Mongu district was 150,129 growing to 162,002 in 2000 (0.8%) then to 179,585 in 2010 (1% increase). Taking into account births, this may imply that migration in and out of the district was not significant. However, the Living Conditions Monitoring Surveys of 2006 and 2010 show that the Western Province in general had the highest proportio n of migrant households moving from one rural area to another (rural to rural migration) at 51 percent in 2006 and 50 percent in 2010. The major reason for this migration is the desire to change from one rural settlement to another in a bid to acquire bigg er arable land. Mongu Constituency has a total population of 88,827 of which 48 percent are male and 52 percent are female (CSO, 2010). 5.14.3 Administration According to Max Gluckman, the Lozi political organization has a long centered system based on a monarch y, whose reigning head is the Paramount King called Litunga whose meaning is \"keeper of the earth\". Further, records in the Nayuma Museum show that the current Litunga, Lubosi Imwiko II, is the 23rd ruler from the time the Lozi Kingdom was established. Max Gluckman and the Missionary Francois Coillard noted in their writings that the Lozi society was highly stratified, with the Litunga at the top and the Ngambela next in line of authority with vested responsibility of overall administration of the Barotse K ingdom in close liaison with headmen known as Indunas. The traditional authority is known as the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE). The Lozi people have preserved their culture, tradition and beliefs over the centuries leading to the candidacy of the Barot se Flood Plain as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Discussions are still on -going between the BRE and the Zambian government. 5.14.4 Social services and amenities 5.14.4.1 Housing, water sources, sanitation and electricity HOUSING The traditional hut is the most common type of house in the flood plain although there has been an increase in the number of improved traditional huts. According to the 2010 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey an estimated 74.9% of the population in Western Province lived in traditional huts and 15 .4% in improved traditional huts. The traditional hut has walls constructed of wooden poles, reeds, mud with a grass thatched roof while the improved hut has corrugated iron sheets for its roof. 5.

The floodplain and plain edge has a small proportion of people, usually the poor and fishermen , living in temporary shelters known as \"Maongo\" made of reeds and grass. Traditional hut (left), and improved traditional hut (right). Temporary shelter (Maongo) (left), and Permanent improved housing WATER SOURCES The main sources of water for peop le living around the six target canals are un -protected wells, boreholes, water bodies such as canals and ox -bow lakes, Zambezi River and protected wells. The Living Conditions Monitoring Survey of 2010 indicates that in Western Province an estimated 41.3 percent of households obtained their water from un -protected wells, 25.1 percent from boreholes, 10 percent from rivers/streams/canals/lakes/scooping hole, and 6.8 percent from protected wells. Schools, Rural Health Centers, and their surrounding communit ies access water from boreholes with Indian Mark 2 pumps. It is important to note that the World Health Organization (WHO) only regards protected wells and boreholes as safe sources among the different water sources. SANITATION Sanitation remains one of th e biggest challenges in the Barotse Plain and many adjacent areas of the uplands. This is largely attributed to the sandy nature of the soil and absence of building stones within the district.According to the Living Conditions Monitoring Survey of 2010, th e Western Province in general had the lowest level of sanitation status with only 7.4 percent households having access to improved/adequate sanitation facilities and 49.9 percent of households are without pit latrines. Where pit latrines existthey are temp orary and made of reeds or grass 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environment al and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 120 The issue of water and sanitation was reported to be in a deplorable state as the temporal pit latrines built with grass usually collapse during the rainy season and it is possible that these toilets contaminate nearby wate r sources used for humans thereby causing diarrhea diseases. During social surveys, people claimed that they do not dig pit latrines because they easily collapse due to the sandy nature of the soil and because burnt bricks and cement to stabilize these pit s were costly. ELECTRICITY The Urban part of Mongu district (on the plateau) is connected to the national grid of ZESCO 66KV running from Victoria Falls Power Station. The flood plain villages are not connected to the grid except for Lealui thanks to the 11KV power line running through the Barotse Plain from Mongu to Kalabo via Libonda. FUEL Fuel (diesel, petrol, paraffin andlubricants) is supplied by oil marketing companies (Puma, Total, Engenand Kobil ). 5.14.4.2 Health facilities Table below shows health fa cilities accessed by people living along the project canals and immediate surrounding settlements. The distance patients have to cover to reach a health facility ranges from 0 to 26 km. Investigations revealed that the health sector has a challenge in the Barotse Plain. The distances from the existing settlements to the health facilities tend to be long and most of them have inadequate admission facilities. However, the health services offered appear to be adequate (see next section).

Education directly contributes towards economic growth, local and national productivity, innovation and social cohesion. The Zambian Education Policy provides for free primary education in line with th e Second Millennium Development Goal that aims to achieve universal primary education for all boys and girls by 2015 (UN, 2000).There are many factors though that affect the attainment of this goal, the most important being location of educational faciliti es in relation to settlements and availability of trained teachers. There are 24 Basic schools 4 Secondary schools from which project -affected communities access educational services and these are given below.

The movement of people including teachers to the upland disrupts children's attendance at school between the months of January and June and the flooding itself reduces accessibility to schools as canoes become the only means of getting to and from school. This impacts negatively on girl pupils as most are not able to navigate dugout canoes. It was also reported during the interviews we had with some of the people in the Barotse Flood Plain that school places were limited in the existing schools the people in the plain use. Mongu also has institutions offering tertiary education. These are University of Barotseland, a newly established private University, Mongu Teachers Training College, Lyambai College of Education and LewanikaSchool of Nursing. Data in previous table indicates that there are more girls than boys enrolled in schools. Access to school in the urban areas is not gender biased as all pupils walk short distances to schools. For rural areas, the situation is different as it is difficult fo r girls to travel an average 10 kmto schools every day. From the social surveys, it became apparent that school performance suffers greatly for the girls and many of them drop out of school early due to their overwhelming household chores. In addition, soc ial surveys have revealed that many villagers prefer to send the boy child to school because education for the girl child is perceived as preparation for marriage. In the plain, social surveys revealed that there are more boys than girls going to school. Girls complained that their counterparts in urban areas walk to the schools within 15 to 20 minutes whilst the shortest distance for most villages surveyed was 3 hours. The challenge of long distances results in children enrolling for primary school late an d dropping out. During the rainy season, when shallow wells are washed away, girls walk long distances to fetch water after knocking off from school and assist their mothers in household chores. The survey noted that as a result many school girls are exha usted and not able to concentrate in class and do not have extra time to study at home. 5. Environmental Baseline Study p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment f or the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 123 For poor young girls going to school in the rural and remotest parts of the Barotse Flood Plain, it is household chores which constitutes the major reason for lateness to school, while they second to sickness as a factor causing absenteeism. Further, data and evidence collected from the scoping meetings and the social survey clearly shows that some parents prefer to send their male children to school becasues the see ed ucation for the girl child is perceived as preparation for marriage. Such social attitudes, are very prevalent among the rural parents and those with limited education as well as those households in which girls perform such roles as selling at the market a nd along the streets. In such households, there is a traditional view that investing in the boy child is more profitable than investing in the girl child remain quite profound (World Bank, 2004). 5.14.5 Water uses and navigation 5.14.5.1 Type of boats in use in the flood plain Boats are widely used throughout the Barotse flood plain for transportation of goods and passengers, and for fishing. Table 31 Number of boats in use in the Barotse floodplain in 2012 Canoes Long Boats (wood planks) Banana B oats (fibre glass) Metal Boats 1,268 71 37 20 Source: Department of Fisheries: Reports of the Statistics Unit CANOES These traditional boats have been used for centuries. They are carved out of a single piece of wood. The actual length range from 2 m for short fishing canoe to 8 m for transportation canoes. Their advantage is a low draught (0.3 to 0.5 m) which allows them to pass even in shallow waters. Deforestation rarefies big trees, which makes the big canoes becoming scarce. They are usually used for fishing or personal transport for the family living in the plain. During the flood, the canoes are the main means of transport for people in between villages. During the dry season, they are used to cross the canals and rivers. They are narrow, and cannot transport a heavy cargo (maximum 10 bags of 50 kg). When loaded, the gunwale is just a few centimeters above the water level, which induces risk of sinking or capsizing when crossing a motor boat. LONG BOATS They are built with assembled wood plank, and m ade waterproof with tar. Lengths are ranging from 8 m to 15 m, with 2 paddlers for the boats under 10 m and 3 paddler or an outboard engine of 25 to 50 HP for the longer ones. Their draught is 0.7 m if used with paddles, 1.5 m if used with an outboard engine. BANANA BOATS Banana boats are a modernized version of the long boat. Banana boats are made of fiberglass, which makes them lighter, more maneuverable, and easier to repair than wood. Their draught is 0.5 m. They can be used with paddlers or a small out board engine. As for the long boats, they are used mainly for transportation of goods and passengers. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the impr oved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 124 SPEED BOATS Speedboats are made of welded steel or fiberglass, they are equipped with 50 to 90 HP engine and can achieve high speed. They are mainly used by the government (Ministry of health, Ministry of education...) for inspection in the flood plain. Due to the engine, they have a draught of 1.5 m and are only used during the flood season. METAL BARGE Made of welded steel plates they can transport heavy lo ads of up to 30 tons, with inboard engines or push by another vessel. Due to their draught of 2 m they are used only during the flood season . Canoe (left) and Long boat (right) 5.14.5.2 Mongu Harbour The harbour at Mongu, known as Mulamba Harbor, is the main hub for transportation of both goods and passengers from the upland to the plain (Lealui, Nalolo) and beyond (Kalabo, Angolan border). It is also the starting point for the new Mongu -Kalabo Road under construction. The infrastructure is composed of four docki ng bay and a warehouse controlled by the Harbor Master to store goods which are offloaded from heavy trucks before they are loaded on boats or lighter 4*4 trucks which will go in the plain. A second warehouse,reportedly under the control of by the BRE, als o exists. Keeping marine traffic reords and tax collection is in principle the responsibility of the the Habour Master, but reliable figures for traffic do not exist and there is no data from the warehouse controlled by the BRE. Moreover, the harbour is no t fenced, thus many goods escape the Harbour Master'sreach and do nottherefore get taxed. 5.14.5.3 Navigation on Muyowamo canal During the dry season, Muyowamo is very shallow, with only 20 cm of water in October. This limited depth only allows small canoes to nav igate Muyowamo during the dry season, mainly personal transport for family living along the canal. A counting in September 2013 assessed an average traffic of less than 10 canoes per day. 5. Environmental Baseline Study \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 125 During the flood season from December to June, navigation is more i ntense. The main use is still the Kuomboka ceremony, which attracts 40 000 people each year (NHCC, 2013). It is important for the Lozi to participate to the ceremony with their own canoe and long boat to form a convoy of up to 300 vessels to escort the Nal ikwanda (Royal Barge). 5.14.5.4 Navigation on Nebubela canal Nebubela is a 6 km canal that links Mongu harbor to the rest of the canal network, so the traffic on this canal is equal to the traffic at the harbor (cf. above). It is deep enough to allow motor boats to navigate throughout the year. The main issue for navigation on this canal is the junction with \"Malile\", the Little Zambezi. A sand bank often forms at this junction, requiring frequent dredging. 5.14.5.5 Navigation on Fisheries canal Fisheries Canal was originall y a navigation canal. Despite having been dredged in 2011, Fisheries canal is currently not navigable during the dry season because of unsufficient water levels. The department of Maritime started digging a harbor with 3 docking bay at the beginning of th e canal in Namushakende, with the idea of transferring some activities from Mongu Harbor to there after the completion of the Mongu / Kalabo road (Nativel, 2013, Harbor master interview). This harbor is not yet used. 5.14.5.6 Navigation on N'gombala canal N'gombala is a recently dug canal as it was started on the initiative of the Maritime Department in 2002 (BRLi, 2013, 1st Stakeholder workshop). The initial design was to make it a navigation canal linking both sides of the plain, but its construction has not been completed. The part on the west bank of the Zambezi has not even been started. It is currently too shallow to be navigable all year round, even for canoes. It is used at the beginning of the flood from January to March, then in March and April the all area is flooded so boats can pass anywhere. Then the canal is used again when the water recedes from May to July. People living close to the canal and boat captains expressed the strong necessity of completing this canal to facilitate transportation. Even if t he population density is low, that area as an important production of milk and rice which needs to be given an access to the markets in Mongu (Nativel, 2013, Interviews). 5.14.5.7 Domestic uses SANITATION There is no sanitation network in Mongu District. Thus, sewe r effluence and domestic waste are washed away by surface runoff into the canals and then into the Zambezi River. Thus, the quality of water in canals may not be suitable for domestic purposes near the urban centers. CAR WASH Full time car wash activities take place in the Kambule stream down town Mongu, this stream is directly connected to Musiamo.This would appear to be an important income generating activity for young men. On average 100 cars are washed every day, with an approximate water use of 200 L (10 bucket) per car (interviews, BRLi, 2013). This activity is a source of pollution with detergent and hydrocarbons for Musiamo canal and Nebubela stream. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 126 Point -source car wash is also done in Musiamo close to Mongu harbor and in Namitome, the main tributa ry to Muyowamo, in Limulunga. LAUNDRY / DISHWASHING The washing of laundry and cooking utensils in the canals is one of the water uses. Households along the sixcanals extensively use canals for these purposes. The water drawn fom the canals is estimated at 100 litres per day per household. Water at the end of the canals is most likely contaminated by washing detergents. Women interviewed while doing their laundry in Musiamo canal complained about the cleanliness of the water around Mongu. Musiamo receives the wastewater from the activities listed above coming from upslope Mongu and the harbor. This underlines the need for development of a proper sanitation treatment plant and sewage network. BATHING All six canals are used for bathing by nearby people. The main issue is children bathing in Mongu harbor, which is very polluted by the numerous pigs and pit latrine directly surrounding the harbor. Laundry washing in Musiamo close to Mongu Harbour (left) and children bathing in Muyowamo canal (right ) DRINKING WATER People living along theN'gombala, Muoyowamo, Fisheries and Lubitamei canals use the canals as sources of drinking water. Most of the time, people drink the water directly without boiling it (BRLi, 2013, interviews). Water is transported from canals to homesteads by women and childrenin 10 or 20-liter buckets. Musiamo canal is not normally used as a source of drinking water because of the poor quality of the water due to other uses that tend to cause pollution such as car wash, domestic effluence, etc . In addition, groundwater is easily available, and boreholes with manual pumps and protected wells have been provided in some villages along the plain edge to provide safe drinking water. 5. Environmental Baseline Study p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 127 SOAKING OF CASSAVA Musiamo and Lubitamei canals are used to soak th e cassava to remove the bitterness, which is cultivated on the upland. The objective of this process is to remove the toxic cyanide component present in raw cassava (FAO, 1990). The cassava tubers are put in bags and left in the canal for three days when t he temperature is high, and up to one week when the weather is cold (June -July). After soaking, the cassava is peeled then dried. Dried chipsare later packed in 50 kg bags and sold or stored. WATER CONSTRAINTS Despite that the canals were initially built f or one main purpose (either navigation or drainage), they are currently used for multiple purposes as shown in the following table. Table 32 Water constraints It has to be noted that some constraints linked to the different uses seems difficult to conciliate: Navigation and animal crossing: for navigation, the water level needs to be at least 1.5 m, although animal crossing require a ford passage; Use Jan.

Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 128 The quality of water required for some domestic uses (drinking water, soaking of cas sava) is incompatible with polluting uses (car wash, sanitation). 5.14.5.8 Canal users from social surveys Below are some of the comments obtained during our social survey interviews with the local inhabitants in the six selected priority canals on the uses and imp ortance of the canals in the Barotse Floodplain. Table 33 Canal uses Name of Canal Uses Lubitamei Irrigation, basket fishing and watering cattle The inhabitants along the canal are involved in vegetable gardening. Musiyamo Interception of water from the uplands, drainage,wateringlivestock, transportation, irrigation, bathing, washing clothes and basket fishing. Communities also soak cassava in the canal. Muoyowamo Transportation from upland to the plain, Kuomboka and Kufuluhela ceremonies,fishing (women and children use the canal for fishing with baskets) and water source for humans and livestock. Transportation of goods and building materials. The canal is also a source of drinking water, bathing and laundry, washing utensils, f ishing and soaking cassava. N'gombala&Nebubela Transportation of people and crops, bathing, washing clothes and watering livestock. Rice (with supa, blue bonnet, xiang Zhou as varieties), local maize, pumpkins and gourds are the most important crops grown along the N'gombala canal. Fisheries Fish breeding and fisheries development, washing and bathing and transportation of charcoal and fire wood. The study noted that canals were constructed for the purposes of delaying inundation of agricultural lands by flood waters so as to allow winter crops to mature, provide irrigation water, to reclaim the fertile strip of land along the plain edge (Musiamo) and as a source of water for livestock; for water transport (N'gombala, Muoyowamo); and fishing (Lubitamei, F isheries). According to floodplain inhabitants, canals facilitate access to fishing grounds, transportation of fish to markets and enables fish traders to reach fishing camps. PEOPLE INVOLVEMENT IN CANAL MAINTENANCE AN D SUGGESTIONS FOR FU TURE MAINTENANCE During social surveys, people from the surveyed villages were asked whether they were involved in canal maintenance and what should be done to maintain canals. The following table summarizes people's answer. 5. \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 129 Table 34 People involve ment in canal maintenance Musiamo People along the Musiamo canal are involved in the clearing of their part of the canal and therefore would like to have the labour -based approach to clearing the canal. However, they would need the appropriate tools and g uidance to reach the appropriate depth. Useage of the machines should be in just opening up the blocked portions. The people proposed that necessary tools be provided to the Disaster Management Committee at local level, which coordinates development projec ts on the ground. People would not do the rehabilitation for free but they should be paid by the project and in future, the modalities for voluntary cleaning and clearing will be agreed upon by the BRE and the local people. For this reason, the BRE ought t o be part and parcel of the planning process for the rehabilitation of the Musiamo canal. People have reported having been involved in the clearing of the Musiamo canal in the recent past through the food for work programme. They were engaged to work on th e canal in exchange for maize, beans and cooking oil by the Vice President's Office Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU). They were using shovels and hoes to clear the canal. Muyowamo All the villages living along this canal are mobilized by th e local Indunas to help in the clearing and the BRE plays a very significant role in the mobilization of the village headmen. The BRE punishes villages with monetary fines if absent. However, according to some communities, getting paid for canal maintenanc e is in line with the abolition of compulsory labour principles. The communities living along the Muoyowamo think that the BRE has a lot of influence in mobilizing local people. It was felt that given its political connections, Muoyowamo is one of the few canals that is well maintained by both the government and the BRE. Women reported that they are also involved in canal clearing. They use cycles to cut the grass while their men use shovels and picks to remove the sand. Libutamei Women are involved in c learing the Lubatamei only for the portions of their field if they are cultivating rice. Communities along Lubitamei, as many communities, pointed out the necessity to use machinery to dredge the canal. No one in the area was willing to get involved in th e canal's maintenance without paid salaries, this would interpreted as forced labour. Also, the government should provide tools for maintenance works. N'gombala The community has never been involved in the clearing of the N'gombala canal except in 2010 when Fisheries Department came to deepen the confluence of the canal. Some young men and women were employed by the Fisheries Department. N'gombala canal was last maintained by hired labour that was paid for with cash or fish contributed by fishermen and f ish traders living in Taisei and Sipolota fishing camps. Some communitiesare also willing to provide free labour for canal maintenance. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in t he Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 130 Fisheries The Fisheries Department dredged the canal in the past. The community is of the opinion that local inhabitan ts should be responsible for future maintenance of canals under the supervision of the BRE. However, they are not willing to maintain canal without getting paid. They also expressed willingness to take responsibility after the government has carried out ma jor rehabilitation works with machinery. The consultants observed that local people would not willingly maintain the canals unless the government maintainedthe system of food for work or cash for work programmes. These are practices employed by the offic e of the Vice -President under the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU) and by Non -Governmental Organizations (NGOs) involved in canal maintenance in the province. HISTORICAL CANAL MAIN TENANCE Information emanating from the meeting held between he admen (Indunas), representing the BRE, and Consultants at Lealui in September 2013 indicates that before independence the canals were maintained by local people with or without token payment from the Barotse Native Treasury. The system of canal maintenance worked reasonably well under traditional authority as people felt duty - bound to clear their part of the canals. Traditional authorities are known to have regulated fishing in the canals by way of prohibiting the use of small -meshed fishing nets and imposi ng a fish ban during the month of December. After Zambia's independence in 1964, the government took over the responsibility of canal maintenance through the Ministry of Water Affairs. Canal maintenance became mechanized for major navigation canals and pe ople were recruited to maintain the other canals and were remunerated financially. Currently, the Government is not able to fulfill its mandate due to budgetary constraints and many stakeholders are calling for a return to the old system. However, this pos es a challenge due to the fact people are now used to beeing paid for any labour contributions to developmental activities. The government system of canal maintenance is claimed to have destroyed the spirit of self -reliance and is expected to take time and effort for the local communities to get back to offering free labour in the six selected priority canals or indeed any canals in the Barotse Flood plain. ADAPTATION TO CHANGE ASSESSMENT In order to characterize impact on sociological component, develop mi tigation measures and to assess resistance to change (see next chapter), it is important to describe people's willingness to change the way they perceive canal maintenance. how do local communities value/perceive their actual canal maintenance system? For most of the communities living along the canals, the present maintenance is not adequate. The canals are clogged, which is preventing the water from flowing normally. As the canals are important for agriculture (Musiamo and Lubitamei) and transport (Fishe ries and N'gombala) the clogging is impacting directly their livelihood. In consequence, the present maintenance system for the canal is not well understood and is perceived negatively. (BRLi/ Niras, 2014 interviews). For Muyowamo and Nebubela the mainte nance is mentioned as being adequate. do local communities and NGOs engage in activities in order to improve canal conditions? 5. Environmental Baseline Study -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub-basin of the Zambezi 131 Some communities are more conscious than others of the importance of canals for drainage of their land. So along a small portion of stretches of Musiamo and Lubitamei canal, communities mobilize to clear the canal (and secondary network) by themselves. On some other parts, the people only clean their tertiary canals (going to their fields) but wait for assistance to clear the main canal. NGO's (Concern, PPS...) and the DDMC are also providing food or cash for work for the clearing of some stretches of the agricultural canals. However, this action is not coordinated, which lead to some stretches of canal being cleared but not the whol e length, which does not really help drainage. are people ready in terms of human resources and technical capacity and are there willing to adaptto get involve in canal maintenance? For Musiamo and Lubitamei, most people are willing to contribute to work o n the canal, but wish to receive something (cash for work or food for work) to compensate for the work. They also complain that they lack the necessary equipments (tools). They have the capacity for removing weeds and small amount of silts but cannot calcu late the slope or evaluate the amount of silt to remove. Neither can they do the coordination between all the different communities on the different stretches of the canals. So the tools, technical advise, supervision and coordination must come from the ca nal management institution. Navigation canals are too deep to be cleared with manual work, so the dredging machine will be used. The communities agreed on this principle. In conclusion, local communities are open to be more involved regarding canal mainte nance, but not without some form of payment. 5.14.6 Livelihood and m arket availability on various commodities OVERVIEW The Barotse Flood Plain plays a very significant role in the livelihoods of its inhabitants. The main sources of livelihoods include fishing, l ivestock rearing, and cropping as well as natural resource exploitation (reeds for construction or crafts). Throughout the social survey, respondents reported the importance of canals in the provision of food security, water source and transportations. During the dry season, the Barotse floodplain is extensively used for communal grazing of cattle; the canals are used for fishing, they enable to maintain the water table at a level that enables cultivation, and are source of irrigation water for vegetable pr oduction and drinking water for cattle. Some canals are also used for transportation of people and goods. During the rains, canals are used for evacuating flash floods from the fields and reducing the risk of crop failure. During the flooding period, many activities concentrate on the uplands (rainfed crops, charcoal burning, grazing of bush...), whereas transport and fishing still occur in the flooded plain. According to World Fish (2012), sources of livelihood of the Barotse Floodplain inhabitant can be divided in four categories: Crop based : Rice, Maize, Cassava, Sorghum Livestock based: Cattle, Goats, Pigs, Chicken Fish and fisheries: Fresh fish, Dried fish Forestry based: Timber and non -timber product (on the plateau), Honey, Reeds and Papyrus products During social surveys, local communities believe that the standards of living will improve with improvement in navigation and irrigation opportunities 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin o f the Zambezi 132 AGRICULTURE The Study area for the project within the Barotse Flood plain is characterized by two farming seasons, namely the winter and rain season cropping. During winter, cultivated areas include Flood Plain edges and dambos in upland river valleys. Crops grown include maize, groundnuts and sweet potatoes planted after the receding of the flood. These grow on residual moisture, while vegetables are irrigated. Rainy season crops include rice grown on selected flood plain sites, maize and other vegetables on Mazulu (mound) in the flood plain and cassava on the upland. These crops are grown for both sale and co nsumption. Floodplain farming systems are diverse, and include raised gardens (Lizulu), rain -fed gardens (Litongo), seepage gardens (wet Litongo), drained seepage gardens (Sishango), lagoon gardens (Sitapa) and riverbank gardens (Litunda). The large percen tage of the Mongu District population have land holding of less than 0.5 ha as shown in the next table. Table 35 Average land holding size Less than 0.5 ha 0.5- 1 ha 1-2 ha 2 ha and above Zambia 45.9 11.7 20.6 21.8 Mongu district 74.5 7.8 9.9 7.8 Source: World Fish, 2012 The major agricultural activities in the Barotse Floodplain are cattle rearing; rice, maize, sugar cane, sorghum kuyuma ), sweet potatoes( ngulu ), pumpkins ( mipushi are the commonly crops; ree ds (Mataka ) and fish( Litapi ) are the most exploited natural resources. The widely planted crop varieties include Blue Bonnet and Supa for rice, local and short maturing hybrids for maize and Nalumino for cassava . To transport paddy rice o x cart are hired, which cost K50 per trip for 60 Kg bagof paddy rice. Permanent settlements along the edge of the plain are dotted with mango trees whose fruit does not easily reach the markets in Mongu because of poor transportation. The table below provides an insight of rice production in Mongu District as a whole. About 80 percent of this production takes place on the Barotse Flood Plain, predominantly in Limulunga, Mongu Central and Ushaa agricultural blocks. Nerica and Supa are the common varieties for rice as noted above. Out of the estimated 280,000 hectares arable land in Western Province, about 10% is found in the floodplain. The main growing season is from November to April with cultivation taking place on raised ridges in the wet plain edges known as Shishanjo an d un-flooded areas known as Mazulu. After floodwaters have receded (July/August) moist shallow areas called Sitapaare are planted with winter maize (local and hybrid varieties) and vegetables (rape, spinach and tomato). Table 36 Rice production in Mongu district Season Area Planted (Ha) Estimated Baseline Study p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambe zi 133 The table below prov ides an insight of Maize production in Mongu District. Table 37 Maize production in Mongu district Season Area Planted (Ha) Estimated Statistics and Early Warning Unit It is important to note that the area planted to cereal crops tends to fluctuate from season to season and production levels are too low tosatisfy household needs. For part of the yea r, households in the floodplain depend on food purchases. These are also the major challenges that inhabitants are faced with in the Barotse Flood Plain. During the period of the said shortage, the households in the Barotse Flood Plain basically tend to increase the fish trade, small shops around the major routes and selling any other products they lay their hands on. Other households with cattle tend to increase their milk production and make sour milk (Mabisi) which fetches more money as opposed to fresh milk. It must be emphasized that the vast majority of the people who live along the Barotse Flood Plain depend on the canals for their livelihood as they depend on irrigation, farming, drainage and fishing. FISHERIES Fish also plays a very significant role in the provision of household protein. Although it is lucrative, it is a seasonal activity that takes place during the dry season (July -December). Fishermen are known to abandon their fishing camps when the Floodplains begin to get flooded and retuning im mediately after the floods have receded. Basket fishing by women in canal shallow waters is also common. The fisheries sector is one of the most important sectors in Western Province. It is mainly concentrated on the floodplains of the upper Zambezi, espe cially the Barotse floodplain. It plays a significant role in the provision of fish protein in the diets of the people of the province and the entire country. LIVESTOCK REARING Most of the cattle population in Western Province is concentrated along the Bar otse Floodplain and adjoining plains. They are one of the most productive cattle rearing areas in the country. Over 200,000 cattle graze on the Barotse Floodplain, the bulk of it managed under a system of transhumance, spending the months of January to Jul y on the uplands and the remainder of the year on the floodplains. Primarily driven by the seasonal availability of pasture, annual transhumance is also important for the distribution of manure. In the floodplain, there is a strong interaction between herding, cropping and fishing activities. The table below provides cattle population estimates for Mongu District during the last three years. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 134 Table 38 Cattle Population estimate for Mongu district Year Cattle Population 1996 118,553 1997 121,055 1998 124,676 1999 125,460 2011 62,257 2012 60,685 Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock During interviews with inhabitants of the Barotse Floodplain it was reported that cattle are generally owned by men and are critical in paying for bride price or dowry. INCOME The major sources of income are fishing, selling cattle, selling milk andcrops (rice and vegetables) in that order. It is estimat ed that fish generates over ZMW 3.5 million per annum with cattle sales generating over ZMW 0.6 million per annum. Minor sources of income include sales of paddy rice and reeds, beer brewing and trading. It is envisaged that the opening of the new Mongu -Kalabo road, the PPCR intervention and the rehabilitation of the six canals will give impetus to increased socio -economic developments in the Barotse Floodplain. Local people expect that the upgrading of the Limulunga -Lukulu road will bring about socio -econo mic development. The Barotse plain poses many challenges among which the most pronounced are limited time for productive use of agricultural lands as they are flooded for about half a year, poor accessibility, limited access to safe water supplies and heal th facilities and lack of ox -drawn implements like harrows. ECONOMIC VALUE OF WET LANDS Local communities receive direct benefits from wetlands in the floodplains. At the household level, wetlands generate an average net financial return of 405 $. The most valuable wetland products are fishes that represent 73% of household cash income, floodplain grazing representing 29%, and crop production 22% (IUCN, 2003). Other wetland -sources of income are shown in the following table. 5.

Mongu is also home to the Zambia Cashew Company that now operates on a very small scale. Other economic activities include Food Reserve Agency (FRA) Crops and fertilizer Shed, Ngulu Hotel and ten operational Lodges, ZANACO, Standard Chartered Bank, BancABC, Zambia National Building Society, Finance Bank and In vestrust Bank have branches in Mongu and provide various financial services to the local inhabitants. Shoprite Checkers has established a Super Market in the town, there are local shops providing similar services. Mongu also has a public library and a smal l airport that handles small aircrafts. LIVELIHOOD KEY CHALLE NGES Fish stocks in the Zambezi River and its basin are declining and efforts of the government and NGOs in promoting fish farming (aquacutlure) both in the plains as well as along the plain edg e have failed to bear fruit. The reasons for this failure have ben attributed to technical factors such as soils being sandy and socio -economic factors such as people not being able to afford the high cost of feed for fish. The blockage in the flow of cana ls has also negatively affected fish breeding and consequently reduced the importance of canals as sources of fish. As fishing is a major source of household income in the Barotse Floodplain, any decrease in the levels of fishery impacts on the local econo my. Climatechange is another challenge that has tended to affect the livelihood systems in the Barotse Flood Plain. Farmers have been farming without the understanding of the effects of climatechanges that are affecting the entire globe. There are no prac tices for climateresilience by most small -scale farmers resulting in low crop yields due to the changing weather pattern manifested in excessive flooding and late onset of rains. Farmers do not have access to climate smart crop varieties and practices. Many of the canals in the Barotse flood plain provide alternative means of access to markets and social services as the existing roadnetwork becomes impassable during the period between December and July when the plain is flooded. Impaired flow of water in th e canals is therefore an important constraint in terms of transport to the floodplain inhabitants. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 136 ADAPTATION TO CHANGE ASSESSMENT In order to characterize impact on sociological component and (see next chapter), it is important to describe people's adapta tion to change regarding their sources of livelihood. Several parameters are described: how do local communities value/perceive their sources of livelihood? The sources of livelihood are perceived as very important by the communities, as they know their survival depends on them. However, due to direct day to day necessity, the people don't often think on the long term when it comes to resources management. This lack of long term vision leads to poor decision and make people sources of livelihood vulnerable to change. do local communities engage in activities in order to improve their sources of livelihood? Some communities try to increase and diversify their source of livelihood, but always with taking minimum risks. Sometimes, activities and decisions are done collectively, but in the vast majority of cases, these are done on an individual or familial scale. are the livelihood activities sustainable? Some activities are sustainable (agriculture, livestock keeping...) but,due to immediate needs, some are fastl y depleting ressources and are threatened at short term (fishing, charcoal burning...). are people ready in terms of human resources and technical capacity and are there willing to change their lifestyle to improve their livelihood? Due to low level of educa tion in the rural area, people are highly resistant to change when it comes to their sources of livelihood. Technological innovation or new resources management techniques take time to get in the habits of people and very often fail when external actors im pose them. The youth and urban people are more willing to change and try new sources of livelihood than the rest of the population. In addition, the strong attachment to customary land tenure system does not allow to any major advancment in term of land an d natural ressources uses. In conclusion, local comunities are highly resistant to social changes regarding their sources of livelihood. 5.14.7 Literacy levels, health and gender equity 5.14.7.1 Education level According to the 2010 Census of Population and Housing, the Western Province as a whole has the second lowest literacy rate for adult population (15 years and older) at 72.5% against the national rate of 83% and for youth population (15 -24 years) at 82%. This could be attributed to low attendance as only 29.6% of the population (5 years and older) were reportedly attending school and only 41.2% and 21% completed Grade 7 and 12, respectively. 5.14.7.2 Diseases The most common diseases recorded in the settlements along the target canals and surrounding areas during our open -ended discussion with Ministry of Health Staff are respiratory infections (Pneumonia and non -pneumonia including HIV), muscular skeletal and connective tissue disorders, malaria, diarrhea, skin infection, throat infection, non -infectious digestive disorders and Intestinal worms. A typical disease prevalence scenario for the first quarter of 2013 as recorded at Mulambwa Urban Clinic whose catchment area covers parts of the Barotse Plain is given in the table below. 5. Environmental Baseline Study p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 137 Table 40 Common dise ases in Mulambwa Urban Clinic Disease Number of patients attended to January February March Total Respiratory infections (Pneumonia & non-Pneumonia) 2,320 2,006 546 4,872 Muscular skeletal and connective 1,207 1,128 2,559 Malaria 920 939 689 2,548 Diarrhea 246 172 258 676 Skin infection 270 79 146 495 Throat infection 169 116 183 468 Non-infectious digestive disorders 99 76 115 290 Intestinal worms 0 82 119 201 Source: Mulambwa Urban Clinic Report for January -March, 2013 Available district -level medical records collected over a period of eight years (2000 -2007) show that of the most prevalent diseases, more deaths were actually attributed to HIV -AIDS (1,081), followed by Malaria (928) and Pneumonia (519). The incidence of HI V/AIDS in Mongu District appears to have been rising in the last decade as table below indicates for the period 2000 to 2007. Data for the period 2008 to date on the HIV/AIDS is being analyzed and would be produced soon by the Ministry of Health. However, the health workers at Mulambwa Urban Clinic noted that with the availability of the Anti -Retroviral Therapy (ART) to the HIV/AIDS patients, the incidence of death among the patients is reducing among the affected. Along the N'gombala canal, it was reporte d during social surveys that many fish traders come into the fishing areas and stay for a long time and that some of them tend to engage in extra marital affairs that might have an effect on the HIV/AIDS infection rates. According to the Zambia Human Devel opment Report of 2007, the incidence of HIV/AIDS for Mongu district was 22.2%. This was 8 % higher than the national level (14.4%). Mongu being located along a transportation route could be another explanation of this high incidence. Table 41 HIV/AIDS incidence in Mongu District (2000 -2007) Year Total Diagnoses In- patient deaths 2000 240 17 2001 268 30 2002 781 118 2003 399 71 2004 510 90 2005 925 233 2006 1,290 249 2007 2,175 273 Total 6,588 1,081 Another source of illnes s is the distillation of local brew \"Kachacu\" common in the project area. The issue is that boiling temperature of this distillation is not controlled. The final product contains a high proportion of unhealthy component (methanol...) causing intoxication and blindness. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 138 5.14.7.3 Gender equity Females constitute an estimated 52.7 percent of the population in Western Province while the male make up 47.3 percent (CSO, 2010). It is important to note that similar female/male ratios are observed in other provinces of Zambia. Traditionally, men are responsible for livestock rearing including milking and milk sales, most of the fishing and much of the pre -planting agricultural activities while women carry out most of the post - land preparation activities, minor fishing in canals and riverbanks using fishing baskets, which fish, is mostly consumed within the household. Women also do most of the domestic chores like food preparation, getting water, washing family linen, childcare and keeping the house and surroundings clean. Some o f these chores are aggravated by the lack of equipment such as hammer mills to prepare maize or cassava. There are expectations that rehabilitation of the canals willbring about increased levels of irrigated rice production and this will increase the wome n's workload, as they are traditionally responsible for breaking clods with hand -hoes once men using oxen have plowed the fields. This will be a challenge to women if there is no deliberate effort to introduce labour -saving tools. Male children are mostly responsible for herding cattle, part -time fishing and harvesting crops while female children are involved in drawing water, household chores, harvesting crops and helping to look after their siblings. Daily calendars for the period of September to November obtained from the social surveys indicate that women put in an average twelve hours (12) of work each day for six days a week compared to eight hours (8) per day for the men. Woman in the plain wake up around 5am and go to bed between 9pm and 10pm after e nd of chores. September to November is a period during which land preparation for rice and weeding the winter maize crop takes place. This pattern applies to most adult men and women living along the six canals (Lubitamei, Muoyowamo, Musiamo, Fisheries and N'gombala). All the women interviewedindicated that they are over -loaded with work. Sundays were reportedly resting days for most of the men and women in the six project canals. Women are the main producers and processors of food for household subsistence and grow a wider range of crops that include maize, sorghum, millet, groundnuts, pumpkins, sweetpotatoes and groundnuts. Women are also responsible to collect firewood to prepare food, which in the plain can be a real challenge. The survey observed that men ploughed the land with oxen and left the fine tilling to women who use hoes for this laborious task. Most of the women in the floodplain do not own oxen andox -drawn implements. This contributed to the heavy workload experienced by women. Women wished t hey could have access to loans for ox -ploughs and implements. Because of low literacy levels and financial insecurity among women -headed households, there is an observed limited capacity to venture into high value crop production and large scale production . In addition to the agricultural work in the field, women process and prepare food for all household members as well as looking after younger children. Women were reported to be responsible for fish processing (salting, sun -drying andsmoking). Like most parts of rural Zambia, the women's workload is relatively heavier than that of men in the Barotse Floodplain. Under Lozi tradition, women have the same inheritance rights as men when it comes to land and such assets as cattle left behind by their parents. Inheritance inequalities in general are not pronounced. However, new land allocation is gender biased, as a male applicant for a new parcel of land tends to be given priority over a female applicant (Chileshe et al., 2005). Further, women are excluded to land ownership in their husband's village of residence. According to the African Development Bank (2006), agriculture and health in the Barotse floodplain is characterized by gender disparities.Women -headed householdstend to be the poorest, having poor acc ess to credit, being vulnerable and prone to malaria and STDs. Alcohol use, povertyand/or the desire for economicadvancement are the key factors that influenced riskysexual behavioramong women in Mongu District (Singh et al., 2011). Baseline Study \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 139 Alcoholism is issues in the plain, surveyed women were worried at the high rates of drinking problem among males, this situation poses a danger to the health and also to labour availability and productivity. In several visited places during social surveys, many men were heavily engaged in the consumption of locally brewed wine. Surveyed women -headed households have mentioned that HIV in the plain is affecting them as they have additional responsibility to look after children left behind by sons and daughters who died from HIV/AID S-related illnesses. Also, they are not able to afford the high fertilizer prices and do not access to subsidized inputs under the Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP) reportedly because they cannot afford membership shares demanded by cooperative societi s and the 50% cost of inputs. The only prominent women group available is the Programme Against Malnutrition (PAM) group in the area. There is also a women's Savings and Credit Association in Namushakende to which most of the village women belong. Most vil lage surveyed did not have any women associations to enhance their welfare. Access to school is also gender biased as presented in previous section . ADAPTATION TO CHANGE ASSESSMENT In order to characterize impact on sociological component and develop mitig ation measures (see next chapter), it is important to describe people's adaptation to change regarding gender aspects. Several elements have to be described: how do local communities value/perceive women and gender aspects? Even if there are Princesses an d village headwomen who have a certain power in the BRE, the perception is that gender inequality is more pronounced in the rural area where the traditional power is still strong. In Mongu town, as the level of education and responsibilities for women are higher the inequalities are less visible. Even though, in urban area, the percentage of women at managing positions in the public and private institutions is still very low. Most people are aware of gender inequalities, but the resistance to change is qui te strong. Even if in theory everybody agrees that more equality and shared tasks could be better, in fact men tend to keep their privileges. do local communities and NGOs engage in activities in order to improve women condition? All NGOs in the area are engaged in activities to improve women condition, either by direct project or as a part of broader actions. Within the communities some formal and informal women group exist, but there is no broad movement. are people ready in terms of human resources an d technical capacity and are there willing to change their perception about women? The change in perception on the gender question is very deeply rooted in the everyday life and habits so it will not change in a short time. It will rather take a generation as the level of education for girls increase and more women have high responsibilities in the society. The current resistance to change regarding gender aspects is moderate but will continuously improve with the next generations. 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 140 5.14.8 Traditional and religious practices and rites THE KUOMBOKA /KUFULUHELA CEREMONIES Lozi culture is strongly influenced by the annual flood cycle, locally known as Lyambai, of the Zambezi River. It is characterized by an annual migration of people from the floodplain to the uplands during the rainy season. The most important of these activities is the Kuomboka ceremony in which the King moves from Lealui, the winter capital in the flood plain, to Limulunga, the summer capital on the upland. The term Kuomboka simply means \"emerging fr om out of waters\". Depending on the flooding regime, the Kuomboka ceremony takes place between the months of February and March. Kuomboka has been an annual event on the ancestral calendar. When the plains are fully flooded the Litunga sails away in a fl otilla of royal boats in a colourful ceremony characterized by an orchestra of traditional music and dance all the way to the uplands in Limulunga. Most of the people living in the flood plain also move.The main Kuomboka is then followed by mini -Kuombokas involving Chieftainess Makwibi who moves from Nalolo to Chieftaines Mboanjikana who moves from Libonda to Mapungu. After the floods have receded, the King and his people return to the floodplain in a ceremony known as Kufuluhela. During both cerem onies, the King moves on the royal barge known as Nalikwanda accompanied by a flotilla of small boats. The Kufuluhela ceremony on the other hand is not so pronounced and publicized. Anthropologists and sociologists have tended to conclude that the Kuomboka ceremony could be traced back to some period in time when there was an exceptional flooding referred to as Meyi -a- lungwangwa, but folklore has it that the ceremony started around 1800 during the reign ofMulambwa. The Kuomboka Ceremony now attracts interna tional and local tourists to Mongu year in March or April. There are efforts by the National Heritage Commission in collaboration with the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE) to have the Barotse Floodplain declared as a World Heritage Site under UNESCO due t o its uniqueness. This initiative is reported to have the support of some sections of society including the BRE, the government and the Litunga. Interviewing the Director of the National Heritage Conservation Commission (NHCC) in Lusaka during this study, he noted that the idea has been well received by the BRE including the Litunga and the local inhabitants in the plain. It is reported that at a workshop for members of parliament held in the province in 2013 there was full support for the idea of a World Heritage Site. The NHCC is continuing with a series of sensitization meeting in the Barotse Flood Plain with all concerned parties. More of these meetings are planned for the various stakeholders before the final implementation of the initiative. The Direc tor reckons the commission will need funds for sensitization of the local people during the construction of the canals. There was a recent evaluation team from UNESCO some months ago and the idea has been pushed forward to Cabinet office. In a recent twis t of events, members of parliament from the Western Province were reported to have objected to the initiative (Post Newspaper, 14th February 2014). The issues surrounding the declaration of the Barotse Floodplain as a heritage site appears not to have been dealt with adequately by the various stakeholders i.e. the BRE, local people and their political representatives. It would be a very good idea to recognize the Barotse Flood Plain including the Kuomboka ceremony as unique features. The following figures s hows the proposed boundary of the Word Heritage site application . 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 142 5.14.9 Assess ment of vulnerability and/or need for resettlement and compensation 5.14.9.1 Vulnerable people MARGINAL FARMERS One the most important group of v ulnerable people in the Barotse is the marginal farmers. Marginal farmers can be defined as persons with few resources and few capital assets.According to Concern Worldwide (2008), many farmers face serious challenges in the Barotse floodplain that contrib utes to their general state of poverty: Exclusion from policy and decision -makingprocesses: many farmers lack confidence in the Government as it has no clear system to involve farmers in such process. Access to farming inputs and credit is weak, most pri ces for inputs are too high. Access to farming credit is often gender biased. Poor agriculture extension service leads to inadequate input delivery, technical advice and information. Due to low number of agriculture extension officers, many farmers in remo te areas of the plain are not reached, farmers seeking advices have to go to officer's office and advices are given without any on -field expertise. Remoteness and lack of storage facility near farming or markets, this situation restricts market activity. Lack of transparency regarding farmers' fund used by the Government. Flooding, droughts and climate changes aggravate flood plain farmers' situation and vulnerability. HIV and AIDS among farmers reduce labour force. Access to health services in remote are as of the plain makes HIV positive farmers even more vulnerable. Marginal farmers facing these challenges are often trapped in a circle of poverty asmost farmers are not able to rely on income from farming to survive (Concern Worldwide, 2008). ORPHANS An orphan is defined as any person up to 20 years of age who has lost at least one parent. According to the Central Statistical Office, the prevalence and levels of orphan hood are a direct consequence of mortality among adults in the population rather than aba ndonment. According to the 2010 Census of Population and Housing, the Western Province had the second highest level per capita of orphans at 18.6% of the population after the Copperbelt Province which had 19.2%. It is also one of the poorest provinces in t erms of incidence, depth and severity of poverty in the country. 5. Environmental Baseline Study p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 143 PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED PEOPLE The overall statistics for physically challenged people in the Western Province is 25,768 as at 2010 (CSO, 2010) representing 2.85 percent of the population . The Government has, in recent years, developed a policy for them that provides for social safety nets through which the vulnerable access assistance. The most visible ones are the social cash transfer scheme (SCTS) administered by the Ministry of Community Dev elopment, Mother and Child (MCDMC), educational bursaries administered by the Ministry of Education and the Programme Against Malnutrition (PAM). Mongu is also home to Cheshire Home International that houses about 200 physically challenged children. The Cheshire Home is working closely with the government in assisting the disabled in Western province. It was reported that the Cheshire Home International covers the entire province in terms of catering for physically challenged children. The Mongu Cheshire Home is aiming at improving quality of the physically challenged children in Mongu District. It has 200 children now through its residential care, rehabilitation, surgery and outreach programmes that offer support to them in the western province and in the wider rural districts of the province. The Home currently maintains assistive devices such as wheel chairs, crutches and calipers and has a small school attached to it. Mongu Nutrition Group (MNG), an NGO established by the Roman Catholic Church is also w orking to help vulnerable people by improving health and nutrition status of vulnerable rural communities in Mongu. It promotes rice production in the district including a loan scheme to assist farmers with inputs. MIGRANT FISHERMEN There appears to be a s ocial problem associated with migrant fishermen who come to the Barotse Floodplain after recession of the floods in June or July and leave at the begining of December when the mandatory government ban on fishing comes into effect. It is reported that these fishermen are responsible for some of the social ills like spreading HIV/AIDS among financially insecure inhabitants and marriages of convenience that contribute to the observed increase in the number of female - headed households and promiscuity. Any incre ase in fishing activities is likely to contribute to such social ills, which are not easy to eradicate as long as women remain financially insecure. CHALLENGES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE Zambia's National Youth Policy defines a youth as any person aged 15 -35 years. The number of youths in the total national labour force as at 2010 was 2,487,764 representing 58.4 % of the population. Of these, 56.9 % were male and 43.1 % were female. Of the youths in the labour force, 16.7% were unemployed. The highest youth un -emplo yment rate was in the age group 20 -24 years at 23.5 % while the lowest rate was in the age group 30 -35 years at 10.2 %. Western Province recorded a 10.1% youth un -employment rate, ranking 7th when compared to the other nine provinces. The high level of un -employment can largely be attributed to a small industrial base and limited opportunities in the town of Mongu. Despite the limited employment opportunities in the floodplain there are no statistical figures thatsuggest serious youth migration to urban are as. The youth in the Barote Floodplain are engaged in the informal sector such as fishing, cattle rearing, trading, and transportation of goods by ox -cart or canoe. Providing financial and entrepreneurship empowerment for expanding the local informal secto r would contribute to alleviating the un -employment pressure being experienced in the Barotse Plains in particular. 5. Envir onmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 144 During social surveys, young peoples from the fifty -five surveyed villages shared their grievances and challenges in the floodplain. They re ported that they would not move out of the plain as there are no job prospects in urban centers, only those pursuing college education were leaving. Some young seasonally migrate to the Zambia Sugar Company's Nakambala plantation in Mazabuka for cane cutti ng. Some also temporary migrate between December and April every year, coinciding with the annual fish ban. POVERTY SITUATION Most districts in Western province continue to be amongst the poorest in Zambia with poverty rates estimated at 83% and Human Deve lopment Index below 0.38% (AAS Zambia Fact Sheet, 2012). AAS Zambia Fact Sheet further points out that people in Western province are vulnerable to poor health and nutrition as reflected in an estimated 56 % stunting growth rate among children under the age of 5 years and rising HIV/AIDS prevalence. Consistent with the overall trend in Zambia, the Western province recorded decline in the proportion of population without access to improved water sources failing from nearly 60% to 56% between 2006 and 2010. S imilarly, compared to other provinces, the Western province has the lowest proportion of its population using pit latrines and flash toilets. It is a fact that large population in Western Province is going without safe water and sanitation services in poor urban areas and rural areas. The effect of a combination of these factors is most severe on the poor. Power water supply and sanitation services in poor rural areas have been the cause of annual outbreaks of water borne diseases during the rainy season, w hich not only puts a heavy economic burden on the already impoverished communities, but also straines the public health services. Poor operation and maintenance of urban an drural water supply facilities not only restricts services to a small number of co nsumers, but also leads to relatively high water charges for the urban poor in the Western Province. In rural areas of Western Province where communities rely on rain -fed agriculture, crop failure and decrease in livestock herds, and results in unaffordabl e food prices and starvation invariably follow failure of the rain season. The most affected and vulnerable people in Western Province are the female -headed households, who have limited social and economic opportunities. Most of the female -headed household s are also looking after large numbers of orphans. The recent Living Conditions Monitoring Surveys (2010) showed that Western Province has the highest incidence of poverty in Zambia. 80.4% of the population were classified as poor compared to the national average of 60.5%. Table 42 Incidence of poverty Total Poor Extremely Poor Moderately Poor Non Poor Total Population All Zambia 60.5 42.3 18.2 39.5 13,013,152 Rural 77.9 57.7 20.2 22.2 8,512,301 Urban 27.5 13.1 14.4 72.5 4,500,8 51 Western Province 80.4 64 16.4 Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 145 5.14.9.2 Land requirement The Project in volves recalibration of existing canals and will require additional land on each side of canal (a few meters on each side) . In addition, the 7 Silting basin and 4 Sand trap s of about 300 m2 each will require land, this economic displacement will have to be addressed in a Resettlement Action Plan, which is a separate mandate from the ESIA. The Project will not involve physical resettlement of people. 5.14.9.3 People's knowledge about the Project From our social survey, it was important to gauge the inhabitants' knowledge on the project for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse Sub -Basin. In the six selected canals four canals most inhabitants knew about the projec t. These were, Muoyowamo, Musiamo, Lubitamei and Fisheries canals. Many of the inhabitants along the Ngo'mbala canal were not aware of the Project.The reason might be associated to the fact that N'gombala is running from the Zambezi River at Mwandi village , a fishing point whose inhabitants are mainly migrant fish traders and fishermen who come and go. The inhabitants that are permanent along the Ngo'mbala are close to Sefula Mission that is on the plain edge. The other reason could be that part of the Ngo' mbala canal is almost dry (has the appearance of a wetland) and has not been in use recently. If rehabilitated, Ngo'mbala is one of the most commercially viable canals that has potential for increasing movement of fish catches from the Zambezi River to fis h markets. In the other canals, women exhibited knowledge about canals including their importance to their communities. At the plain edge end of the Fisheries canal at Namushakende, womeninterviewed alluded to the fact that the canal was important to the c ommunities living around the new harbour being constructed as fish traders have established a fish market and the local inhabitants do not have to travel the 13 kilometre -distance to the Zambezi River to buy fish. Rehabilitation of this particular canal wo uld enhance transportation of fish by fishermen and fish traders. Equally, the local people are looking forward to the completion of the planned harbour. Further, the inhabitants along all the six selected canals are eagerly looking forward to job opportun ities during the implementation of the rehabilitation project. PEOPLE GRIEVANCES During social surveys, people from the fifty -five surveyed villages shared their grievances, whether project -related or not. Grievances toward the proposed canal rehabilitati on project mainly relate to the fact that canal maintenance is a major activity that cannot be effectively be carried out by manual labour alone. The people have the feeling that involving them for minor regular maintenance activities could be the best opt ion once major works have been carried out by the use of machines. They also have the feeling that local traditional leadership is not fully involved on maintenance works. Many also questioned the effectiveness of the actual dredger that only deposited dre dged silt on the banks and which material is then washed back in the canals during the rainy season. Many communities also complain about poor sanitation. During the rainy season, water becomes contaminated by overflowing pit latrines leading to incidenc es of diarrhea. In addition to these grievances, women also raised many gender -related grievances; they are presented in the \"gender aspect\" section. 5. Environmental Baseline Stud y Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 146 Table 43 People grievances raised during social surveys Musiamo Efficient dred gers should be used so that a good depth is attained and to ensure the dredged sand and silt are not left on the canal edges but spread a distance away. According to surveyed villagers, some sections of Musiamo canal have mud and may require the use of dre dging machines since they have muddy soils that are difficult to work using hand tools. These sections are at Nasisholo, Kembi, Namakomena and Namakeka Villages. The Project is welcome especially if it reduces impact from flood by improving drainage, whic h would lead to more rice production. They also forsee that the Musiamo will have fast flowing water and will also contribute to more land being drained for farming. Villagers hope that this will increase agricultural productivity in the village. Fishing a ctivities will increase in the villages, as the water will be flowing from very far. Poor sanitation and housing are major problems for the communities. There are no safe water points where to draw water for their homesteads. People get water from the bloc ked Musiamo canal or the scoop wells that they dug along the canal. The animals, cattle, pigs and dogs also use these water sources. Due to the poor water villagers drink, there is a lot of malaria and diarrheal in the village. According to many people, if canals are restored, it is important that bridges are provided for allow people and livestock to cross restored canals. There is also a need to stop people from blocking the Musiamo with fish traps called \"Malelo\". This type of fishing is blocking the flo w of water in the Musiamo canal. Local communities expect to get some employments from the Project. The problem of the lack of rice market was reported. Muyowamo A professional with proper equipment to dredge the canals should be hired as currently the Maritime Department is using a very basic dredger from Finland known as Water Master which throws the dredged soil and silt just a few meters from the bank. Materials are then washed back when it rains. Local communities expect to get some employment from the Project. There is also a need to stop people from blocking the Muyowamo with \"Malelo\"fish traps. This type of fishing is blocking the flow of water in the canal. The issue of poor sanitation is also common along Muyowamo, diarrhea incidence is high in villages due to collapsing latrines during the flood. With improved water flow in the canals, people expect the breeding of mosquitoes to reduce with an associated reduction in the incidence of malaria. Libutamei The community expects that during canal rehabilitation, some form of temporarily employment shall be provided to the local people and that they will not accept imported workforce from outside Lubatamei canal. 5. Environmental Baseline Study tal and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 147 There is the feeling that once the canal is rehabilitated flooding will stop or reduce and therefore more land will be available for cultivation. Some people have proposed that Ikwichi Bridge be rebuild and expanded during the rehabilitation of the Lubitamei canal, according to them this will allow maximum flow of water from the uplands. Local communities would also like have footbridges. According to communities, the canal is too wide to be maintained by hand and that there is a thick sand layer that prevents effective deepening by manual labour. Communities proposed that the usage of mach ines be considered during the rehabilitation of the Lubitamei canal as it needs some good depth and good width to sustain the transportation of poles and timber from the upland to the flood plain for construction as it was in the past. Communities expect t o have more fishes in the canal. The government should empower traditional authorities through headmen to oversee management and maintenance after dredging.It was also suggested that satellite Disaster Management and Mitigation Committees in collaboration with traditional leadership be given the responsibility of overseing canal maintenance. Poor housing and sanitation were also challenges for Lubutamei inhabitants, for example, the local well for water is very dirty and leads to diarrhea diseases. People h ave to travel great distance to schools and health clinic. N'gombala&Nebubela During the rehabilitation, the community expects the canal to be widened and deepened to allow navigation of large boats and canoes. They expect that canal restoration will sho rten the distances fish traders have to travel to buy fish. The communities expect that village headmen and women will be involved during the rehabilitation of the canals and its maintenance thereafter. The people hope that this time around all the silt an d sand deposits dredged should be disposed off far from the banks of the canal to prevent their being washed back into the canal by floods. The expectation of the communities is that local people will be given priority over those from outside areas of Mong u and Namushakende when it comes to employment. The community was of the view that headmen should be in the forefront of canal maintenance. The type of housing and toilets are not encouraging and the people use the bush than temporary pit latrines. The san itation situation is even worse during the rainy season. Also, being located in the middle of the plain, obtaining firewood is a major challenge for communities. According to farmers, it is important to understand the social fabric of the Lozi people, and that failure in involving the BRE in leadership for canal maintenance could lead to poor mobilization of villagers for maintenance tasks. According to them, this is one of the reason why the Sefula irrigated rice scheme is performing poorly. Failure in inv olving all stakeholders during design phase of the scheme is another reason. Fisheries 5. Environmental Baseline Study Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 148 The people in the village expect that during canal rehabilitation local villagers will be accorded employment opportunities. Many people also hope that business will i ncrease once the harbour completed, this harbor will increase chances of the establishment of a permanent market structure in the area. Some villagers believe that Fisheries canal is too deep. Communities have mentioned that excess flooding of rice due to poor water control, drought in the recent past, rice pests which include mice and fishhas affected crop production. Some villagers wish to have a programme that can provide cement to build permanent toilets on self-help basis. 5.14.10 Conclusion on socio economic and cultural set up The use of floodplain resources was in the past managed according to traditional systems, under the customary authority of the Litunga. Today, although formal control over natural resources has been passed over to central and provincia l government, the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE) maintains a great influence on natural resource use and regulation. The Lozi people are also known as the \"plains or water people\", and local livelihoods and cultural traditions are linked closely with se asonal flooding. During the dry season, the bulk of local production, economic activities and settlement are focused in the floodplain area. As the plain becomes inundated, most of the population moves to the uplands and plain fringes. This annual relocat ion of people and cattle including the Litunga in a highly - celebrated ceremony has become a national and international tourism event. Most of the population in the Barotse Flood Plain depends on a mixed livelihood strategy, combining crop farming, livestoc k keeping, fishing and natural resource exploitation. This diversity of livelihood components, many of which depend on wetlands and canals, is an effective strategy for spreading risk, and income and subsistence sources vary at different times, especially according to season. The rural economy is for the most part subsistence -based, and is subject to high levels of uncertainty and variability. The Barotse Flood plain is characterized by two farming seasons, namely the winter and rain season cropping. Durin g winter, cultivated areas include Flood Plain edges and dambos in upland river valleys. Crops grown include maize, groundnuts and sweet potatoes planted after the receding of the flood. These grow on residual moisture, while vegetables are irrigated. Rain y season crops include rice grown on selected flood plain sites, maize and other vegetables on Mazulu (mound) in the flood plain and cassava on the upland. These crops are grown for both sale and consumption. Floodplain farming systems are diverse, they in clude raised gardens (Lizulu), rain -fed village gardens Litongo), seepage gardens (wet Litongo), drained seepage gardens (Sishango), lagoon gardens (Sitapa) and riverbank gardens (Litunda). Most of the cattle in Western Province are found along the Zambezi floodplain and adjoining plains. The Barotse Floodplain is known to be one of the most productive cattle areas in the country. Over 200,000 cattle are pastured on the Barotse floodplain, the bulk of it managed under a system of transhumance, spending the months of January to July in the floodplain and the remainder of the year in the uplands. Primarily driven by the seasonal availability of pasture, annual transhumance is also important for the distribution of manure, and in the floodplain there is a stron g interaction between herding, cropping and fishing activities. The fisheries sector is one of the most important sectors in Western Province. It is mainly concentrated on the floodplains of the upper Zambezi, especially the Barotse floodplain. It plays a significant role in the provision of fish protein in the diets of the people of the province and the entire country. 6.

IMPACTS This section studies all modifications to baseline that will be brought by the Project's foreseen activities. Impact assessment d oes not study cumulative impacts since projects impact are limited to the Study area and that there are no known sources of direct impacts on wetlands other than traditional agricultural activities in the Plain. Discussions with stakeholders were done duri ng the third workshop in June 2014 to gather people opinion and concern s on potential impacts based on the presentation of the Conceptual Desing report. Issues are addressed in this final ESIA version. ESIA IMPACT ASSESSMENT ME THOD Environmental Impact As sessment uses the following method. Thresholds are defined for each component. Impact assessment is based on the integration of 6 factors: identification of impact sources determination of affected components' value Impact duration Impact extent Impact in tensity Impact occurrence probability Points 2 to 5 enable to determine impact significance. Point 6 enables to assess the probability that the impact will occur. This helps separating \"risks\" from \"impacts\" (that are actually going to take place). CRITERI A #1 IDENTIFICATION OF IMP ACT SOURCES An impact identification matrix (see next section) presents activities (in lines) as well as components (in columns) and identifies all sources of impacts. The impact identification matrix differentiates positive from negative impacts. CRITERIA #2 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL COMPONENTS VALUE Each component of the natural environment are analyzed according to their value in the study area (see baseline chapter). Value assessment is based on Experts' knowledge of the compone nt, field surveys, public consultation, etc. Value analysis does not take into account foreseen impacts, it is purely based on the component intrinsic value. Protection status, symbolic importance, cultural value, significance for the World Bank, etc. are all influencing the component value. Three threshold levels are used: Low, Moderate and High value components. Values of each component are presented in the Baseline section. 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 150 CRITERIA #3 IMPACT DURATION Each impact is identified according to its duration. Temporary and permanent impact can be distinguished based on their reversibility: temporary are reversible and permanent are irreversible (or will last all through the Project lifespan ). CRITERIA #4 IMPACT EXTENT Each impact is defined by its geographical extent. Three levels will be established: point -source impact, local impact and regional impact. Point -source impacts affect a component on a very small scale of the study area, i.e. a small proportion of the study area wildlife population or plants. Local impacts affect a component on the entire or the majority of the detailed study area in opposition to regional impacts that affect a component on a larger scale such as the entire Study area or outside its boundaries. CRITERIA #5 IMPACT INTENSITY Impact intensity refers to level of disruption on the component based on its level of intactness. Impact on highly intact ecosystems is usually more intense than on weakly intact ones. Disruption of natural component refers to death of species, displacement, fr agmentation and loss of habitats. Three threshold levels of intensities are utilized: Minor, Moderate and Major. IMPACT SIGNIFICANCE D ETERMINATION Impact significance is based on the four previous criteria. The following table presents the impact importanc e determination. Positive impact are assessed using the same criteria. 6. Impacts p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 151 Table 44 Negative impact assessment Intensity Extent Duration Environmental and Social Component value Low Moderate High High Regional Permanent Temporary Local Permanent Temporary Point -source Permanent Temporary Moderate Regional Permanent Temporary Local Permanent Temporary Point -source Permanent Temporary Low Regional Permanent Tempo rary Local Permanent Temporary Point -source Permanent Temporary Negative Impact significance Major Moderate Minor Negligible Table 45 Positive impact assessment Intensity Extent Durat ion Environmental and Social Component value Low Moderate High High Regional Permanent Temporary Local Permanent Temporary Point -source Permanent Temporary Moderate Regional Permanent Temporary Local Permanen t Temporary Point -source Permanent Temporary Low Regional Permanent Temporary Local Permanent Temporary Point -source Permanent Temporary Positive Impact significance Major Moderate Minor Negligible Major negative impacts represent high level of perturbation of the component usually irreversible, these impacts are seldom mitigable and most of the times require compensation or offsets, followed by measurable monitoring measures. Moder ate negative impacts represent noticeable perturbation of the component, however these impacts can be mitigated and need to be monitored. Minor impacts most of the time only require mitigation measures without the need for monitoring. Negligible impacts do not require any particular measures. 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessme nt for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 152 CRITERIA #6: IMPACT OCCURRENCE PRO BABILITY Assessment of the probability that an impact will take place is based on the expert's experience on similar assignments and the type of activity that generate the impact . Three thresholds are used as shown in the following table. High probability Analysis of the baseline coupled with Project characteristics concludes that the impact will take place. Potential occurrence Based on previous experiences, it is possible that the impact will occur. Risk (low probability) Analysis of baseline coupled with Project characteristics only reveals a risk of impact occurrence. 6.1 BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT The Project is, in its essence, a \"social project \" which ultimate aim is to improve pe ople's livelihood, therefore it is typical to have a majority of socio economic positive impacts. However, with foreseen activities being located in or nearby wetlands (see baseline section), improvement of people livelihood in a wetland is, by definition, weakly compatible with environmental conservation and will inevitably lead to some form of wetland degradation. Therefore, there are only few positive environmental impacts. However, proposed measures will aim at finding balance between economic developme nt and wetland protection . Since the Project is a development project, most impacts are related to modifications of the natural environment and there are no impact assessment of the operation phase. Impact assessment does not study the probable increase of agriculture activities in dried out wetlands because of improved drainage. Impact on physical environment is presented in the following sections: Impact on local hydrology and soils: impact on wetland and impact on fishes Impact on water quality: impact o n fishes IMPACT IDENTIFICATION MATRIX Impact asse ssment is based on the changes that Project actions will bring on environmental components presented in the baseline. The following table is an impact identification matri x. The matrix crosses foreseen acti vities with each components. The impact identification matrix differentiates positive (+) from negative impacts (-). Regular canal maintenance activities will have similar impact than initial r eshaping and deepening of canals. 6.

Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 154 6.1.1 Environmental impact assessment study limitation There are two s tudy limitations . First, there is l imited available secondary scientific data, most of them come from Timberlake (1998) report called \"Biodiversity of the Zambezi Basin Wetlands, Review and preliminary Assessment of Available Information Phase 1, Final report\" and this document is rather old . The second limitation comes from the fact that rare or pro tected plant species and Mongu shovelnose frog distribution in the plain are unknown, since the area has not been extensively surveyed . Therefore , this ESIA could not assess whether they will be impacted or not. 6.1.2 Impact on wetland habitats The most serious concern regarding the Project implementation is its potential impacts on wetlands due to reshaping of canals for improved drainage. According to the Information Sheet on Ramsar, wetlands canal drainage is one of the biggest identified threat to Zambezi flo oplain Ramsar site. The following activities will impact wetlands: Reshaping of canals with excavation (dredger or excavator) along the following canals: Musiamo (manual labour since ) Lubitamei N'gombala Fisheries Installation of water control structure s along the following canals: Musiamo Lubitamei EXCAVATION AND WATER CONTROL STRUCTURES W ILL AFFECT WETLANDS HYDROLOGY IN MANY WA YS Many canals because of flow blockage and poor maintenance have created small wetlands or feed nearby wetlands. This is part icularly the case along N'gombala canal where many perennial marshes are located. Improving flow due to excavation of canals will therefore reduce the available water for adjacent wetlands and lead to their draught. Installation of water control structures will allow for modification of canal hydrology as well (retention of water during the dry season and release of water during the wet season). Water control structures will therefore control connected wetlands water level. Impact significance will be Moder ate as shown in the following table. 6. Impacts and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 155 Impact significance Moderate Affected component 's value Perennial marshes are highly valued Duration Impact will be permanent Extent The extent of the impact is local Intensity Impact intensity will be moderate, since improved navigation of N'gombala will increase partial drainage of perennial wetlands hydrologically connected to it . An estimate , based on Google Earth imagery , predicts disturbance of approximately 2 5 ha of perennial marshes. Fortunately, this type of ecosystem is present on a large scale in the study area (in the Study area an area of 40 274 ha has high concentration of perennial wetlands). Observation on site from the wetland specialist has revealed that papyrus is commonly harvested in these wetl ands; therefore, the impact on environment also has a minor negative consequence on people livelihood since papyrus requires constant level of water. In addition, spoils from dredger or excavator , if deposited in wetlands, will disturbed them. The excava tor could also transport invasive plant species from one area to another . Impact occurrence probability This impact has a high probability to take place. Dredging, will improve canal flow and will drain nearby wetlands. Installation of water control structures will allow for modification of canal hydrology as well. This is particularly the case along Musiamo and Lubitamei canals where wet grassland are located. Plant composition could also change because of improved drainage, with less water accumulation and longer periods of draught, many obligated wetland species will be replaced by facultative wetland species and bushes, this situation will also lead to decrease in plant diversity. Both canals follow closely wet grasslands, they will therefore be the mo st impacted wetlands. Impact significance is Moderate for the wet grasslands along Musiamo as well as along Lubitamei. Impact significance is Minor along Fisheries. Impact significance Moderate along Musiamo and Lubitamei Minor along Fisheries Affected component 's value Wet grasslands are highly valued Duration Impact will be permanent Extent The extent of the impact is local Intensity Along Musiamo and Lubitamei , the impact will be of moderate intensity , since the activity will only improve an existi ng fonction of drainage , it will not affect a pristine ecosystem but rather an ecosystem already affected by human activities such as peat soils burning and agricultural activities. In addition, drainage will be controlled with water control structures (st op logs) to avoid complete draught of wetlands. However, the impact is still significant because i n the Barotse floodplain: 2 986 ha of wetlands (peatland) will be drained (along Musiamo) and in the Luena flats: 4 764 ha will be drained (along Lubitamei). The amount of peatland that will be drained (2 986 ha) represent between 0.24 and 0.27 % of the total estimated peatland in Zambia (between 11 060 and 12 201 ha) (see baseline), but represent the totality of the peatland in the Study area. As mentioned in the baseline, the extent of peatland in the Barotse flooplain is unknown. 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority tra ditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 156 In the past, human attempt to dominate peatlands along Musiamo were always lost against their strong resilience, many sources of water were feeding them (seepages, etc.), and the an nual flood was a major constrain to development. With dredging, peatland will retain less water. In addition, spoils from excavator , if deposited in wetlands, will further disturbed them. Excavation of Musiamo and Libutamei will be done with an excavator that will invetably encroach in the wetlands since both canal are running in the middle of the wetlands. In addition, t he excavator could transport invasive plant species from one area to another . Along Fisheries, impact from dredging will be of low inte nsity since the canal crosses limited surface area of wetlands. Impact occurrence probability This impact has a high probability to take place. EXCAVATION AND WATER CONTROL STRUCTURES I N PEAT BOGS WILL ALL OW FOR RELEASE OF GR EENHOUSE GASES Peat soil are important store of soil carbon and sink for carbon dioxide and are sources of atmospheric methane. The sequestering function of peat bogs for carbon dioxide outweight the release of methane, peat bogs are therefore net GHG sink. Drainage induce peat oxid ation, since peat soils are exposed to oxygen (aerobic decomposition), this action releases CO 2. Existing drainage from Musiamo and smaller canals and regular peat bogs fire has already initiate release of GHG from the peat bogs. It is therefore difficult to assess the amount of GHG that will be released from improved drainage. Based on the 2013 Supplement to the 2006 I ntergovernmental Panel Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for Nati onal Greenhouse Gas Inventories, for tropical drained w etlands grassland ma de of organic soil, the emission factor for CO 2 is 9.6 tonnes per hectare per year and 7.0 kg CH 4 per hectare per year (using the Tier 1 method). Tier 1 method use the d efault emission factors when detailed specifications are missing. Under the Tier 1 meth od, if the typical range of mean annual water table levels of drained organic soils for each landuse category is unknown, the default is that the organic soil is deep -drained . Using Tier 1 method , there is no differentiation between CO 2 emissions from long -term drained organic soils and organic soils after initial drainage or where drainage is deepened. This element further makes it difficult to assess the amount of GHG that will be released due to improved drainage. EXCESSIVE DRAINAGE OF PLATEAU LAKES DUE TO IMPROVED CANAL DR AINAGE Some participants of the third workshops raised the issue of excessive drainage of plateau lakes through dambos due to improved drainage of Lubitamei and Namitome canal s. According to them, these issues would affect agricultural productivity by creating dryer conditions. This issue is addressed in the latest version of the conceptual design that proposes to install additional water control structures at lake drainage key points to allow local users to control drainage hence fac ilitating cultivation of flood recession crops . This ESIA also proposes to implement a Canal User Association in the plateau area that is drained by Lubitamei and Namitome canal s. This indirect impact significance is difficult to assess. However, it will b e monitored since the conceptual design has developed a monitoring and evaluation plan, which objectives is to give a methodology to measure the effects of the project and to evaluate its efficiency and to provide a quality service provided to Canal User A ssociations. 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 157 CUMULATIVE IMPACT ON WETLANDS Impact assessment does not study in -depth cumulative impacts since Project impacts are limited to the Study area. The only known source of direct impacts on wetlands other than traditional agricultural activitie s in the Plain is the under -construction Mongu -Kalabo road. This road creates serious impacts on wetlands on both their hydrology and their ecological continuity. The presence of a causeway across the plain and the numerous borrow pits along it has left a permanent impacts on wetlands and wetland dependent wildlife. Once in operation, this road will fragmentize wildlife habitat for amphibian, birds and fishes. Mongu -Kalabo ESIA road has poorly assessed impact on ecological components it is therefore difficult to assess cumulative impacts. MEASURES Avoidance Unfortunately, impacts on both ecosystems are unavoidable since dredging and excavating are the Project rationale. Mitigation Mitigation measures can be implemented to minimize encroachment in wetland s: For all work, it strongly suggested to avoid importing soil for embankment construction, but rather use excavated soil from canal bed for embankment. In addition, excavated soil shall be directly reused without creating large soil deposits. This is part icularly important with peat soils where direct reuse will allow plant revegetation and ecological function recovery. For wet grassland along Musiamo (peat bog): if embankment are required, it is suggested to directly use the excavated peat soils for emba nkment rather than importing soils. This will allow for providing habitats for wetland plant and herpetofauna and quick ecological recovery. If embankment is not necessary, all peat soils shall be spread on a uniform layer on the western side of the canal. For wet grassland along Libutamei: excavated soil shall also be reused as embankment. If not possible, it shall be given to local farmers to be reused locally. The canal runs in the middle of the wetland, avoiding encroachment by machinery will not be pos sible. For perennial marshes along N'gombala: the canal bed is sandy, the excavated material will not serve any ecological purposes. It will be forbidden to spread the sandy material close to perennial wetlands. These mitigation measures, are rather best management practices for work in wetlands, they will not mitigate \"per say\" long terms impacts on wetlands. Compensation The surface of wetlands disturbed by canal improvement is: Libutamei canal: 4,764 ha grassland (peat bog); N'gombala canal: 25 ha of perennial marshes. Compensation areas for these losses are not required by national law, however this section present a few reflections on compensation and offsets areas. 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub-basin of the Zambezi 158 Conservation areas are sites where h uman activities are restricted or prohibited in order to fully safeguard ecological functions of an area. In the context of the Project, it is difficult to designate conservation areas along affected canals since it is impossible to selectively drain one a rea along Musiamo, Lubitamei and N'gombala and not the other. This would create inequalities between communities who would get advantages from drained lands. This section will study different options: Designate offsets areas instead of conservation areas. Offsets areas are site outside the Project scope of impact set for restoration or protection. The principle would be to protect wetlands for the losses of other wetlands. Compensate the impact by designating a fish protection area along wetlands; Compens ate the impact by implementing a wetland management plan. Wetlands for wetlands Offsets are based on the principle of designating an area that has equal or superior ecological value to compensate for the losses, in the case of the current Project, large ar eas of wet grassland will be lost and would require offsets. Perennial marshes along the Malile and Zambezi could be good offset area. These marshes occupy oxbow lakes, and are sometimes located close to human settlements and are at risk of impacts from new settlement due to the presence of the Mongu -Kalabo road. The advantage of th ese wetland s is that they covers a relatively large area, a large ratio of offset to damaged area would therefore be possible. A total of 40,274 ha between the Zambezi and the Malile has a high concentration of perennial wetlands (see baseline map). However, the principle of offsets, to achieve ecological equivalence in a separate location, will only be achieved for the 25 ha of perennial marshes impacted. For the disturbances o f wet grasslands, the principle of offsets will not be achieved, wet grasslands and perennial marshes do not have the same ecological functions. Perennial marshes are quality habitat for fish, fish eating birds and water dependent mammals but have low plan t diversity while wet grassland offer quality habitat for passerine birds, herpetofauna and have high plant diversity. The following table recap the ecological functions of both types of wetlands (as presented in the baseline section). Both wet grassland a long Musiamo and perennial marshes are high quality habitat. Perennial marshes Wet grassland Although plant diversity is rather low, perennial marshes' quality, relate to their habitat feature for animals. These wetlands are high quality spawning ground s for fishes, thanks to their emergent vegetation and their hydro - connectivity with rivers (Malile and Zambezi). Being connected to rivers, many fishes are trapped in them when water retrieves attracting foraging fish eating birds and mammals. They create a buffer zone between terrestrial, human impacted areas and the rivers. Along Musiamo: These wetlands have peaty soils indicating long term wetness and allowing for particular plant diversity to thrive as well as offering high quality habitats for salamand ers (and all herpetofauna), passerine birds and carnivorous plants. Peat soils are also important GHG sinks. Spawning activity is limited in this area due to the remoteness from the Malile and the Zambezi. Along Libutamei: These wetlands offer good quality habitat for herpetofauna. Vegetation is less diverse that its Barotse counterpart. Spawning activity is limited in this area due to the isolation from the Malile and the Zambezi. Bubble fish present in Plateau Lakes used to spawn in these wetlands, howeve r according to villagers they are declining. 6. Impacts \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 159 One other option would be to protect and restore a peat bog outside of the influence of Musiamo. A good example of restoration would be to select peat bog that was previously cultivated and abandoned. To impro ve habitat quality, existing local drainage canals could be blocked using small peat digues to raise the water table. The advantage of this type of compensation is that it that it will enable to achieve ecological equivalence for the losses of wet grasslan d since an identical ecosystem would be protected. However, it would be difficult to apply a ratio lost wetland - compensated wetland since the vast majority of wet grassland peat bogs in the vicinity will be impacted by Musiamo improved drainage and that available land is limited due to multiple agriculture use of wet grasslands. Based on these explanations, in addition to the tremendous land tenure issues, and long process of consultation with communities in setting land aside for full protection, the pro posed designation of offsets areas based on the principle of wetlands for wetlands would be rather difficult. Fish Protection Area One candidate for compensation could be the riverine grasslands area along the Zambezi. Fisheries in these wetlands suffer fr om illegal use of fishing gears, this issue could be the subject of aimed actions. One program actually exist s to manage fishery activities in the floodplain: World Fish (a research center part of the CGIAR) in partnership with Namibia Nature Foundation i s currently starting the creation of Fish Protection Area in the plain. The objective would be to create a safe haven for the animal to breed and grow, which will then enable them to restock the rest of the plain. To achieve this goal, the priority is to r einforce the capacities of ZAWA and Department of Fisheries, and their cooperation with the BRE. Th ese links are enabled by the Zambian Fisheries Act under the \"co - management\" system. A good cooperation with the community will enable the different stakehol ders to efficiently control the hunting and fishing method s and enforce the regulations. In order to implement this compensation, discussions between the Project proponents ( Zambian Ministry of Transport, Wo rks, Supply and Communications) and World Fish/Na mibia Nature Foundation need to be established in order to: Study the possibility of including riverine grasslands of the Study area in the Fish Protection Area. This would necessitate developing aimed activities that will ensure positive effects in the St udy area. Study the possibility of co -financing the declaration of a Fish Protection Area based on the inclusion of riverine grassland in the protected area (through the PPCR). This compensation would be implemented by World Fish since they have the techn ical expertise and there are the proponent of the Fish Protection Area in the plain. Zambian Ministry of Transport, Works, Supply and Communications would be the co -funding organism of this Fish Protection Area. Wetland Management Plan Instead of offset ar eas, compensation could be in the form of a Comprehensive Wetland Delineation, Zoning and Management Plan . Being a Ramsar site, such a plan could be useful. Although Management plan is not a requirement for Ramsar sites, it is a recommended management too l as mentioned in Article 3 -1 of the Convention \" The Contracting Parties shall formulate and implement their planning so as to promote the conservation of the wetlands included in the List, and as far as possible the wise use of wetlands in their territory \". As mentioned in baseline, the Ramsar site delineation does not include wetlands along the Libutamei canal (Luena flats) as well as the critical habitat of the Banded Neolebias ( Neolebias lozii ), a critically endangered fish (according to IUCN red list) . Since these wetlands are all hydrologically connected, it is recommended to add them to the management plan. 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 160 Such plan has to follow the \"Guidelines on Management Planning for Ramsar Sites and Other Wetlands\". According to these guidelines, there are thre e sections in the Management plan: Description of the site including description of social indicators and sources of people livelihood, flora and fauna. Evaluation and objectives: Evaluation is the assessment of the major feature of the site. In the case of the Zambezi floodplain , a special focus could be paid to wetlands delineation. This delineation would be based on botanical and pedological criteria rather than water coverage during the annual flood. It will necessitate fine characterization of each we tland system including the inventory of rare and protected plants and wildlife and fine description of the hydrology of wetlands. In addition, local knowledge of uses and ecological functions of wetlands shall be gathered through consultations and integrat ed in the assessment. Fine description of wetlands will enable to understand the synergy between wetlands and potential direct and indirect threats. Objectives have to be measurable. Long term and operational objectives shall be defined in the plan. Long -term objectives should aimed at conservation and sustainable use of natural resources; it will necessitate commitments from stakeholders. The plan will quantified the human and financial resources required to achieve objectives. The overall objective of suc h plan would be to implement actions to improve the state and knowledge of wetlands and to implement a zoning of the plain in order to define acceptable activities . Action plan/prescriptions: Actions shall aim at improving the state of the wetlands. The p lan will include management measures for valued habita ts: including a zoning of the Ramsar site that will based on a value system recognizing wetlands hydrological, ecological and socio -economical functions and defining zones of protection, zone of sustain able activities, buffer zones, etc. Based on the zoning, the plan would develop activities that aim at improving the state of wetlands. The plan will include s pecies management measures : the site is home of several valued or protected species who will nece ssitate aimed management activities. The plan zoning will define acceptable usage of natural resources. The plan will define actions such as educational activities, communication with stakeholders and research. etc. The current management of the Ramsar si te is under the responsibility of the Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) . The management plan and its objectives could be under the responsibility of a join-partnership between ZAWA, Fisheries Department , Department of Water Affairs and the BRE (Barotse Roya l Establishment) as it represents the customary authority in charge of traditional management of canals in the plain. Capacity building and funds would be necessary to ensure long - term management of such plan. A management plan would need to be carried o ut by a consultant with experience in biodiversity management plan. It will also require capacity building and training for the Zambia Wildlife Authority in order to implement recommended measures. Consultation with the BRE and local communities would be r equired in order to establish the management plan and to reach agreements on the plan actions, objectives and zoning. Development of the management plan could also involve local scientific knowledge to carry out on - field flora and fauna surveys. Such knowl edge could come from the University of Barotseland for monitoring activities (if they have capacities to carry out fauna and flora surveys). Fauna and flora surveys would aim at wetland dependent species to fill the serious gap in terms of scientific knowl edge in the plain. As mentioned before, one serious limitation to the environmental impact assessment is the lack of up -to-date scientific data in the plain . The plan and its zoning must be in line with the valued cultural elements identified in the \"App lication for inclusion of the Barotse cultural landscape on the World Heritage Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 161 Funds shall be gathered to implement such plan and to achieve and maintain good management of the wetlands. Once approuved, the plan shall be a legal document, involving enforcement of measures. This measure seems to be the most adequate and feasible one, and would bring many positive impacts to the plain . This measure is required in order to ensure that wetlands in the Barotse are well managed. Best management practic es for work near wetland Best management practices apply to construction phase: Prior to all work, the work contractor must be aware and sensitized about the following topics: He must be in possession of the map showing areas with high con centration of we tlands (see study area map ). The ecological and economic value of the wetlands to limit encroachment. The interdiction to pick bird eggs or chicks, fish or any wildlife. The interdiction to refuel in or near wetlands. The use of booms in case of spills and the procedure for decontamination Machinery must be in good operating condition and free of leaks. If soil is needed to backfill, only clean soil shall be used After machinery has finished its work, land shall be left with the same grade and elevation has it was in its original state Refueling and maintenance of machinery, including washing machinery and storing fuel is strictly prohibited in wetlands (except for dredgers). Machinery operating in or near wetland must be equipped with oil spill containment equipment such as floating boom. In case of oil spill, the area of the spill must be confined with booms and the water inside the boom must be pumped or the contaminated soil excavated. Contaminated water or soil must be removed from the project area. RESIDUAL IMPACT The following table shows the residual impact significance.

Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 162 6.1.3 Impact on dry land habitats Dry land habitats, such as trees, channel banks , grassland Savanna will probably impacted to some extent along all canal by r eshaping activities of canals with excavation (dredger or excavator) . The following activities will impact dry land habitats : Reshaping of canals with ex cavation (dredger or excavator) along all canals. Excavator as well as their passage in the plain are likely to affect dry land habitats . Dredge material deposit will be favoured in dryland rather than wetland which will affect them to some extent. Channel banks will be modified due to dredging and reshaping of channels and passage of machinery will affect grasslands. Impact significance on dryland is of Minor significance. Impact significance Minor Affected component 's value Trees of the plain : Moderate Channel banks : Moderate Grassland savanna : Low Duration The impact will be temporarily Extent The impact will be local Intensity The intensity of the impact will be low Impact occurrence probability This impact has a high probability to take place. However, impact on trees have a low probability to take place since trees will most likely be avoided by excavators and dredgers. MEASURES Avoidance During activities, it is recommended to avoid cutting trees, since they are scares in the flood plain, there are resting and nesting areas for passerine birds. Mitigation There are only few mitigation to reduce impact on dryland ecosyste m, one would be to limit as much as possible to build large sand deposit. Compensation No compensation are necessary since impact significan ce is Minor . RESIDUAL IMPACT The following table shows the residual impact significance. Dryland habitats Impact significance before mitigation Impact significance after mitigation Trees of the plain Minor Minor Channel banks Minor Mino r Grassland savanna -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 163 6.1.4 Impact on fishes Two different situations have to be presen ted to analyse impact on fishes: as mentioned in the baseline sections, during the annual flood, fishes occupy the entire floodplain in search for spawning ground s, emergent tall grass are favoured by fishes. During the flood, canals become channels to reach spawning grounds throughout the plain. During the dry season, canals are less frequented by fishes as mentioned in the baseline, the presence or absence of fis hing camps along canals reveals the level of habitat quality for fishes. The following activities will impact fishes: Reshaping of the canal with excavation (dredger or excavator) of all canals, with N'gombala likely to be dredged during the flood season. Strengthening the flood dikes of Muyowamo Installation of water control structures of Muyowamo, Musiamo, Lubitamei Building of sand trap and/or silt basin along Muyowamo, Nebubela, Fisheries, N'Gombala and Lubitamei Rehabilitation of low water crossings al ong Lubitamei These activities will all impact fishes in a similar manner: temporary disturbances of fishes during construction due to earthwork creating high turbidity in water (sediment release) and positive impact s on some fishes thanks to increase flow and deeper channels , long term potential negative impact on fishes that rely on canal and wetland vegetation to spawn late in the flood season . Building of a control structure (barrel) at downstream outfall of N'gombala will probably not impact fishes si nce, during the flood (high water level), this structure will be submerged and therefore will not severed ecological continuity for fishes. The first table presents the negative impacts during activities on canals. Negative impact will be of Minor signifi cance for all canals. Impact significance Minor Affected component's value Fisheries canal: High N'gombala canal: Low Nebubela canal: High Musiamo canal: Moderate during flooding period, low in the dry season Libutamei canal: Low Muoyowamo can al: Low, especially close to Limulunga Duration The negative impacts will be temporary Extent The impact will be local Intensity The intensity will be moderate, most activities (except for N'gombala) will take place in the dry season reducing pressure on fishes. Turbidity created by the dredger or excavator could hinder fish movement during spawning period, also suspended silt can clog spawning ground. Impact occurrence probability The impact will potentially take place (potential occurrence) On the long term, improvement of canals will probably have some form of positive impacts on some fishes since new areas will have permanent water . This positive impact will only take place as long as depth of water is not too swallow following canal enlargement. Swallow water will restrain fishes in their movement. 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 164 Fishes that spawn in wetlands late in the flood season (such as Cichlidae Barbel) could however be disavataged as improved drainage will accelerate run off from wetlands. Overall, i mpact is therefore neither positive nor negative. MEASURES FOR NEGATIVE IMPACTS Avoidance All work in canals involving excavators must be avoided dur ing the rainy season between December and April. It is also suggested to avoid starting works once the rainy season starts, around late October. Baseline has highlighted the critical periods for fishes. The following table summarizes these critical periods that need to be avoided. Table 47 Critical period for fishes Period of work Restriction Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec SSpawning High water Levels Low Barbel ) Critical period Sensitive period Less sensitive period Mitigation No mitigation measure can be implemented, starting excavation and dredging in th e upstream -end of canals would allow startled fishes to move to downstream areas with clearer water. However, since canals are fed by springs this would create floods if work begins at upstream end of canals. Compensation Impact significance is Minor, n o compensation measures are necessary. If riverine grasslands are included in a Fish Protection Area as presented in previous sections, general state of fishes may improve in the area. Discussion on large -scale aquaculture in the plain In order to mitigate the rapid depletion of fishes in the plain, large -scale aquaculture in the plain could represent a valuable measure ; however, several arguments are rather opposed to such measure: Wild fish es are much more efficient at reproducing naturally if they are giv en habitat protection. In fact naive, pond -reared fingerlings are easy targets for predators, whereas wild -reared fish learn predator avoidance from their parents ; There is a risk of introducing diseases such as EUS with intensively pond -reared fish ; There is a risk of introducing invasive species such as the Tilapia; Potential for aquaculture is limited in the Plain due to the annual flood and the sandy nature of the soil; Implementing aquaculture diverts attention away from the need to look after the wi ld brood stock if fishers think they can catch everything as the waters will be restocked artificially. 6. Impacts / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 165 More successful are fish ranching in areas away from naturally -restockable waters, such as temporary pans and borrow pits, where fingerlings can be intr oduced when the pans fill during the rains, and resultant pan -sized fish can be harvested when the pans start to dry out a few months later. Such fishponds exist along the Musiamo canal. Development of fishponds is out of the scope of this ESIA since impa cts on fishes are either of minor significance or positive, large -scale aquaculture is also not proposed in this ESIA. Best management practices for work near rivers Best management practices apply to construction phase for work in or near the Zambezi and the Malile : If needed, backfill material shall be certified free of pollutants. If soil or riprap is needed to stabilize channels, only clean material shall be used. Riprap shall be free of silt and other debris. Machinery shall operate from watercourse b ank without disturbing bank stability. Refueling and maintenance of machinery, including washing machinery and storing fuel is strictly prohibited in a 100m radius from rivers. Machinery operating in or near rivers must be equipped with oil spill containm ent equipment such as floating boom design for fuel and oil containment. Machinery must be in good operating condition and free of leaks. In case of oil spill, the area of the spill must be confined with oil booms and the water inside the boom must be pump ed or the contaminated soil excavated. Raw concrete and concrete washwater shall never be release in any waterbody, including canals but shall be stored in washout containers and evacuated by road tanker to be treated outside the plain . Concrete washwater from cleaning concrete trucks drums could also be reused as batch water to make fresh concrete . The washout container cannot be installed less than 100 m from any waterbody. RESIDUAL IMPACT The following table shows the residual negative impact significan ce.

Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 166 MEASURE TO ENHANCE PO SITIVE IMPACT Regular maintenance activities in canal could ensure long -term positive impacts for some fish species in the Study area (however, as mentioned earlier improved drainage can locally give disadvantage to some species du e to accelerated drainage of wetlands) . These maintenance activities will be described in the Design report. Nevertheless , improved habitat quality for fishes will probably attract more fishermen and as long as illegal fishing gears are used, this positive impact will only momentary. As mentioned in the social impact assessment, the rehabilitation of the six canals will hopefully enable the Department of Fisheries to enforce the fish ban and implement the Fisheries Co -Management program . 6.1.5 Impact on birds As mentioned in the baseline, many birds behavior in the plain are linked to the annual flood that dictates habitat loss and availability. During rising and receding waters, sensitivity is higher for birds since most of them strongly rely on wetland function s for foraging. This section does not analysis impact on birds with special status, a specific section will study impact on each special status birds. The following activities will impact birds: Reshaping of canals with excavation (dredger or excavator) a long all canals Impact during construction is related to the disturbance of water birds caused by the machinery. This impact is of Minor significance as presented in the next table. Impact significance Minor Affected component 's value Birds are highly va lued in the plain Duration Impact are temporary (limited to construction activities). Extent Impact is local Intensity Birds will be disturbed by excavator and dredger noises and spoils deposition. Drainage of wetlands will require birds to forage elsew here. Impact intensity is low, since there are many areas that will remain untouched where birds will move during dredging and excavating activities (they are readily mobile ). Birds mortality is foreseen if trees are cut as they are used by nesting weaver (passerine birds). Birds of prey will not be impacted by activities. Impact occurrence probability This impact has a high probability to take place. MEASURES All measures to mitigate impacts on wetlands will help reduce impacts on birds. Avoidance All work in canals involving excavators must be avoid ed all work during the rainy season as it the breeding season of most waterbirds. However, the African Skimmer , an IUCN near threatened bird, breed s during the peak of the dry season. Specific mitigation for s pecies with status are presented in a separate section. As mentioned before it is strongly recommended to avoid cutting any trees to preserve the few nesting areas of passerine birds. 6. Impacts and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 167 Mitigation No specific mitigation measures are proposed. Compensation Impact significance is Minor, there is no need for compensation. RESIDUAL IMPACT The following table shows the residual impact significance. Birds Impact significance before mitigation Impact significance after mitigation Waterbirds, passerine and birds of prey Minor Minor 6.1.6 Impact on mammals The Project will not have any impact on herbivore since as mentioned in the baseline section they are not present in the Study area. Impacts on small mammals such as rodents and bats will also be insignificant since a ctivities are not likely to modify their habitats. This section will therefore focus on impacts on aquatic mammals. The following activities could impact aquatic mammals: Reshaping of canals with excavation (dredger or excavator) at junctions between the Nebubela and N'gombala and the Malile and Zambezi. The two species at stakes are hippos and otters since they inhabit the Zambezi and the Malile. One hippo is present at the junction between the Nebubela and the Malile. They will not be impacted by any ac tivities outside the junctions between these two canals and natural watercourses. The possible impact is of Minor significance. Impact significance Minor Affected component 's value High Duration Temporary Extent Point -source as impact will be localize d at junctions Intensity Low, the chance of collision between a hippo or an otter and the dredger or the excavator is almost nil, these animal may be disturbed by activities. There is also a risk that spoil from dredgers and excavator be deposited in pere nnial wetlands and affect otters. Impact occurrence probability Risk, there is only a small chance that aquatic mammals will be affected by dredging and excavation MEASURES Avoidance No particular avoidance measure can be implemented. 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 168 Mitigation Extrem e care has to be made not to deposit any spoils in perennial wetlands along the Zambezi or the Malile. These wetlands are confirmed habitats of Spotted -necked Otters. The hippo at the junction between the Malile and the Nebubela will normally be startled by the presence of a dredger; however, special precaution will have to be paid not to harm the animal (if it is still there during construction). Compensation No particular compensation measures is necessary since the impact is of Minor significance. RESIDU AL IMPACT The following table shows the residual impact significance. Mammals Impact significance before mitigation Impact significance after mitigation Hippos and spotted -necked Otters Minor Minor 6.1.7 Impact on herpetofauna As mentioned in the baseline sec tion, few information is available on life cycle of reptiles, some of them lay their eggs in November -December, eggs hatch in January -March. More information is available about amphibians: males start their calling songs when the rainy season starts (Timbe rlake, 1998). Mating season is the most vulnerable time of the year during which impacts on herpetofauna will be stronger. The following activities will impact herpetofauna: Reshaping of canals with excavation (dredger or excavator) along all canals. Impac t on herpetofauna is a key issue when carrying out work in canals since they are confined to small territories or home ranges, they are not very mobile and slow giving them little ability to escape from construction activities and making them vulnerable to obstacles and pollution. Moreover, amphibians are in contact with water, any oil spill from excavator or dredger will have deleterious effects on amphibian. Many canals, thanks to their level of bank degradation, low current and clogging from emergent gra sses, have evolved as wetlands, offering quality habitat for amphibians. Degraded canals ave gentle slopes allowing for passage of herpetofauna, with reshaping of canals, there is a risk that steep slopes will create impassable obstacles for many species. Impacts can be summarize as follow: Disturbance of wetlands, habitat of many herpetofauna species, Startle of species, Mortality of species due to collision, Entrapment of turtles and amphibians in canals and potholes created by machinery , Risk of oil sp ills affecting amphibians. Impact significance is Moderate for aquatic and wetland species and Minor for terrestrial specie as shown in the following table. 6.

The most sensitive area is along Musiamo since the area offers quality habitat for amphibian (thanks to peat bogs) Impact occurrence probability This impact has a high probability to take place. Oil spills are a risk and have a low probability of occurrence. MEASURES Avoidance It is strongly suggested to avoid al l work during the rainy season, from December to May to avoid disturbing reproduction. Mitigation In order to mitigate im pacts on herpetofauna, it is strongly suggested to avoid creating steep slopes while reshaping canals; gentle slopes allow for colonization of vegetation, and will allow for movement of amphibians and turtles. Since herpetofauna are very sensitive to oil spills, it is recommended to sensitize dredger operator and excavator how to avoid oil spill while refueling. Other mitigation measures presented in the wetland section could help mitigation impacts on herpetofauna. However, the main source of impact, whi ch is disturbance of wetlands, is not mitigable since improvement of canals is the project rationale. Impact significance after mitigation will therefore remain the same. Compensation Compensation for wetland losses (as presented in the wetland section) will be beneficial to herpetofauna. RESIDUAL IMPACT The following table shows the residual impact significance.

Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse s ub-basin of the Zambezi 170 6.1.8 Impact on wetland dependent insects As mentioned in baseline, removal of emergent wetlands and riparian vegetation is a source of impact on Odonata and wetland dependent Lepidoptera. By opposition to other groups of animals, wetland depe ndent insects mate during the dry season. The following activities will impact herpetofauna: Reshaping of canals with excavation (dredger or excavator) along all canals. During reshaping activities, removal of emergent vegetation will impact Odonata since wetland plants are important in the life cycle of such insects. For example, Odonata eggs are laid on wetland plants, larval stage (nymph) take place in the water. Nymphs climb up emergent leaves and to become adults. Impact of activities on Odo nate is of Moderate significance. Regarding butterflies, their life cycle are not linked to water. K notgrass (Polygonum) are important for larvae, fortunately, these plants often grow at some distance from permanent water sources during the dry season. Dr edging and excavating are not likely to affect K notgrass . Therefore, the impact of activities on such insect is of Minor significance. Impact significance Minor of butterflies Moderate for Odonata Affected component's value High Duration Impacts on wet lands dependent species will be temporary Extent The impact will be local Intensity For Odonate, the intensity will be moderate, some mortality of larvae and eggs are foreseen due to water work, disturbances on mating and eggs deposition is foreseen since work will take place during the dry season, which is the mating season. For Lepidoptera (butterflies), the intensity will be low as the group is not directly dependent on water. Impact occurrence probability This impact has a high probability to take pl ace MEASURES Avoidance No avoidance measure can be proposed since it is best to avoid all work during the rainy season. Work in dry season will inevitably impact Odonata. Avoiding clearing wetlands plant is rather impossible. Mitigation Mitigation measur es proposed for herpetofauna and wetlands will contribute to mitigate impacts on insects. However, the main source of impact, which is disturbance of wetlands, is not mitigable since improvement of canals is the project rational. Impact significance after mitigation will therefore remain the same. Compensation Compensation for wetland losses (as presented in the wetland section) will be beneficial to insects . 6.

FISH WITH STATUS The Banded Neolebias ( Neolebias lozii ), a critically endangered fish (according to IUCN red list) is present nearby the study area in two waterbodies: the Kataba River and its tributary the Siandra stream (right outside of Musiamo canal at its southern tip, 4 0 km south of Mongu , see sensitive area map). With current knowledge, the Project will not have any direct impact on the species. However, any additional work on Musiamo in the fish habitat will have deleterious impact on the fish. It is therefore required to avoid all work in the delineated critical habitat including both Kataba River, Siandra stream and their web of wetlands toward the Zambezi as shown in the map. Currently, the foreseen activities of this Project do not encroach in this area. However in the medium term, it is planned to recalibrate Musiamo further South , this has to be avoided in the fish habitat . The presence of this fish call for integrating his critical habitat in the proposed Wetland Management Plan (see impact on wetlands). BIRDS WIT H STATUS Outside of temporary disturbance due to presence of excavator or dredger, t here is no particular serious impact on waterbids with special status , other than those presented in the previous bird section, for the following reasons: Slaty Egret: this species does not breed in the area. Impact is therefore no different from other non-protected waterbirds. Wattled Crane: no particular threat since the species can move in function to water availability, although this species breeds in the Study area, it was already recommended to avoid the rainy season (breeding season) in the previous section; Great Snipe: no particular threat since the species can occupy many type of habitats. African Skimmer: the species breed in the dry season on sand banks along broa d rivers, there is a risk of impact is dredger or excavator encroach on sand banks along canals, however, such encroachment will not take place along the Malile or the Zambezi where sand banks are located, therefore there is no foreseen particular impact o n this species. 6.

The M ongu shovelnose frog , a rare endemic frog to the Bar otse region, could be impacted by the Project since it inhabits wetlands, living most of his life in the mud. Earthwork could impact this species. Since no inventory of that species has ever been carried out, it is impossible to assess the probability that some specimen would be impacted. It is, with today information, also impossible to assess whether the floodplain is a Critical Natural Habitat from the species (as defined in the OP 4.04 Natural Habitats). However, it has to be considered potentially pres ent along or near canals to be rehabilitated and the plain has to be considered an important habitat. The following activities could impact the M ongu shovelnose frog : Reshaping of canals with excavation (dredger or excavator) along all canals In case of sp ecimen mortality due to the dredger or excavator, impact would be of Major significance as shown in the following table. Although very little is known about the species abundance, the only scientific article that studied the species mentions that it is mos t likely very rare and localised (Channing & Broadley, 2002), the p recautionary principle will consider that the species is very rare, and only localized in the Barotse flood plain. Impact significance Major Affected component's value High Duration Impacts could be permanent in case of high mortality caused by the dredger or excavator, in that case, taken into account that the species is really rare, mortality of a few specimen could have deletirous long term effects on the species. Extent The impact will be local Intensity The impact is of high intensity since, from known data; the Mongu shovelnose frog has a very limited home range and is very rare. Impact occurrence probability This impact has low probability to take place (risk) since very littl e is known about this species repartition in the Barotse. Measures Since no specific inventory of the species has been carried out, nothing more than measures proposed in previous section for the protection of wetlands and herpetofauna can be proposed. As mentioned in these sections, work shall be carried out during the dry season. The only possible specific mitigation measure would be to hire a biologist who can recognize the distinctive advertisement call of the Mongu shovelnose frog and its morphology (as shown in the following figures) and carry out listening and recording surveys along all canals to be rehabilitated. The total length of canal to be rehabilitated is more than 150 km, only a few foreign biologists have identified this species, involving such international experts along 150 km of canal, is not economically feasible. 6.

As explained in previous section s, the main impacting activities will be reshap ing of canal s with excavation (dredger or excavator) . Reshaping of canal s will improve drainage of wetlands, reduc ing their water retention capacity, thus reducing their ecological value for obligated wetlands plant species, amphibians and other water depe ndent wildlife. Reshaping of canal s could however improve fish habitat continuity, which is a positive impact as long as adequate measures are implemented to stop the use of illegal fishing equipment . One element that is an absolute requirements is the av oidance of the delineated protection zone for the critical natural habitat of the Banded Neolebias ( Neolebias lozii ) south of the Study area. Any work on Musiamo in the delineated area (Kataba River, Siandra stream and their associated dambos and wetlands) , will have major impact on the critically endangered species. Currently, the foreseen activities of this Project do not encroach in this area. However in the medium term, it is planned to recalibrate Musiamo further South, this has to be avoided in the fi sh habitat . Implementation of mitigation measures for negative impacts will not reduce them significantly. This is because , besides best management practices, there are limited actions and that can be implemented in order to reduce impacts during construc tion activities . This situation calls for compensation or offsets, three options are presented in the ESIA and were discussed during the third Workshop: Designate offsets areas instead of conservation areas. Offsets areas are sites outside the Project scop e of impact set for restoration or protection. The principle would be to protect wetlands for the damage on other wetlands. The proposed designation of offsets areas would be rather difficult due to customary land tenure issues and the difficulties to find equivalent wetlands close to the Study area. Compensate the impact by designating a fish protection area along wetlands. One candidate for compensation could be the riverine grasslands area along the Zambezi. Fisheries in these wetlands suffer from illeg al use of fishing gears, this issue could be the subject of aimed actions. One program actually exists to manage fishery activities in the floodplain: World Fish (a research center part of the CGIAR) in partnership with Namibia Nature Foundation is current ly starting the creation of Fish Protection Area in the plain. Discussions between the Project proponents (Zambian Ministry of Transport, Works, Supply and Communications) and World Fish/Namibia Nature Foundation could to be established in order to study t he possibility of including riverine grasslands of the Study area in the Fish Protection Area. Compensate the impact by implementing a Comprehensive Wetland Delineation, Zoning and Management Plan. Being a Ramsar site, such a plan could be useful. Although Management plan is not a requirement for Ramsar sites, it is a recommended management tool. This measure seems to be the most adequate and feasible one, and would bring many positive impacts to the plain. This option was presented during the third worksho p and discussed in a group. Participants agreed that a management plan would be useful for the wetlands. The presence of IUCN species calls for such management tool. Impact assessment does not study in -depth cumulative impacts since Project impacts are lim ited to the Study area. The only known source of direct impacts on wetlands other than traditional agricultural activities in the Plain is the under -construction Mongu -Kalabo road. This road creates serious impacts on wetlands on both their hydrology and t heir ecological continuity. The presence of a causeway across the plain and the numerous borrow pits along it has left a permanent impacts on wetlands and wetland dependent wildlife. Once in operation, this road will fragmentize wildlife habitat for amphib ian, birds and fishes. 6.

The rehabilitation of the six canals has potential to generate positive and negative impacts on the inhabitants and workers involved in the rehabilitation wo rks, which impacts should be understood by the promoters, in this case the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ), the community leadership and contractors so that measures to avoid, mitigate or enhance them are put in place. Impacts are referred to a s positive if they are capable of enhancing the effect caused by the project and as negative when they reduce the effect. The social survey in the six priority canals identified few negative impacts on the social, economic and cultural state as compared t o positive ones and these are described below . 6.3.1 Impact identification matrix Impact Type of Impact Duration Intensity Spatial extent Probability of occurrence Sensitivity Overall significance CONSTRUCTION PHASE Settlements No impact - - - - - Negligible Population increase Direct Temporary Minor Site Potential Low Minor Land tenure No impact - - - Low - Negligible Cultural heritage No impact - - - Low - - Agriculture production (disrupted irrigation) Direct Temporary Moderate Localized High Moderate Moderate Increased fishing due to improved access to markets Direct Temporary Minor Localized High Low Minor Women and Youth Direct Temporary Major Localized Potential High Major Vulnerable groups Indirect Temporary Major Localized Potential High Major Housing No impact - - - Low - Negligible Disrupted Water supply to households dependent on target canals for water Direct Temporary Major Localized High High Major Reduced water quality Direct Temporary Major Localized High Moderate Major Sanitat ion No impact - - - - - Negligible Improved access to health facilities No impact - - - - - Negligible Improved access to Schools No impact - - - - - - Increased incidence of HIV/AIDS Direct Permanent Moderate Localized High High Major Increased incid ence of Sexually Transmitted Infections Direct Temporary Moderate Localized High High Major Employment creation Direct Temporary Moderate Localized High High Major Increased transportation of goods and passengers Direct Temporary Moderate Site Low Low Negligible Improved Navigation Direct Temporary Minor Localized Low Low Negligible Increased trade Direct Temporary Minor Localized Potential Low Minor 6.

It was observed that many farmers cultivated rice, maize and vegetables on the immediate banks of some canals without consideration for a strip of separating land. MEASURE TO MITIGATE I MPAC T The owners of the fields that have been established along the edges of the canals should be advised by the Project developer to be based at the provincial headquarters in Mongu to harvest and remove their produce long before commencement of rehabilitatio n works. As such, these affected persons will not be compensated because they will not lose any income. 6. Impacts p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority tra ditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 185 6.3.3 Impact on resettlement 6.3.3.1 Loss of land (physical resettlement) The Project will not involve any physical resettlement of people. 6.3.3.2 Loss of livelihood (econ omic displacement) The Project involves recalibration of existing canals that may require additional land on each side of canal (a few meters on each side). In addition, the 7 Silting basin and 4 Sand traps of about 300 m2 each will require land. This eco nomic displacement will have to be addressed in a Resettlement Action Plan, which is a separate mandate from the ESIA. 6.3.4 Loss of access routes Improvement of canal will not cause any significant issue regarding access route, on the contrary, canal recalibra tion will improve mobility of local communities. As mentioned in the Project description section, the Project will design 3 crossing points for cattle in Fisheries canal. 6.3.5 Loss/restriction of access to common resources (water front, forest) During canal re storation, water will become turbid due to excavation. However, canal water is not drinkable, there fore there is no impact on drinking water sources. For other domestic use s, they will be temporarily disturbance, people may have to walk a few hundred meter for excavation site. The Project developer will have to provide in cases of more important disturbances domestic water to affected communities (truck tank) . Improvement of canal will not cause any significant issue regarding access to common resources , on the contrary, canal recalibration will improve access to fish resources in the Malile river. 6.3.6 Loss of customary rights The Project will not cause any significant issue regarding customary rights. Since no land will be alienated from customary right. 6.3.7 Damag e to agriculture/fisheries The Project will increase agricultural and fishery production (see positive impact section). 6.3.8 Loss of amenity values The Project wil not cause any loss of amenity value. 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 186 6.3.9 Loss of ethnicity (culture/traditions ) The Project has been built using participative approach, and the customary authorities (BRE), the Project does not lead to loss of ethnicity. 6.3.10 People's health and wellbeing 6.3.10.1 Increased incidence of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS IMPACT ASSESSMENT During the r ehabilitation of the six priority canals, the local workers and imported skilled workers like machine operators will bring more money into Mongu district and this is likely to result in such social vices as excessive beer drinking and prostitution causing an increase in incidences of STIs and new HIV/AIDS cases. This is a significant negative impact with long -term effects. To mitigate the impact, measures will need to be put in place to ensure that awareness creation on STIs and HIV/AIDS is undertaken amon g the local communities living along the six priority canals and among workers. The measures will include outsourcing sensitization materials from relevant institutions and using existing channels such as Mongu Hospital, Rural Health Centres, District AIDS Taskforce or Non -Governmental Organizations (NGOs). MEASURE TO MITIGATE I MPACT Increased flow of fish traders and migrant fishermen into the Barotse Flood Plain, relatively high poverty levels due to lack of employment opportunities and lack of awareness are partly responsible for increased social immorality among the communities living along the six priority canals. The Project developer in close coordination with the BRE will need to create awareness and increase access to condoms among villagers and work ers in order to reduce the spread of STIs and HIV/AIDS. The Project developer will need to outsource specialized services from hospitals/clinics in the area in order to provide early diagnosis and hence treatment. The PPCR will also need to involve commu nity leaders in the sensitization process . 6.3.10.2 Occupational accidents IMPACT ASSESSMENT Improper usage of construction equipment during the construction phase can cause accidents which can lead to fatalities or injury among workers. This negative impact is l ocalized and of low significance. MEASURE TO MITIGATE I MPACT During the rehabilitation, the Project developer should strive to enforce good working ethics and conditions in all the six canals and training of construction workers in safety in order to ensur e worker's safety and minimize accidents. The contractor will also need to ensure that rehabilitation equipment/machinery is properly serviced. 6. Impacts \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub-basin of the Zambezi 187 Health and Safety measures Health and Safety measures apply to construction phase: When working in or near water (including canals), all machinery must have a life jacket or a buoyant work vest. Ring buoys shall be present on site . When working in or near water (including canals), the construction contractor must warn local authorities and village headmen about the risks to navigation. At all time, the construction contractor must restrict access of the construction site to outsiders (including fishermen, children, etc.) the work area must be delineated with construction fences. All workers on construction site must wear personal protective equipment: Safety boots Helmet (h ard hats) Gloves Ear plugs and protective eyeglasses (goggles) must also be provided to workers in particular cases When welding takes place, w elding shields must be used. First aid kits must be a vailable on site. At least one worker on site must be trained for first aid. 6.3.11 Positive impacts 6.3.11.1 Employment creation IMPACT ASSESSMENT During the rehabilitation phase of the canals, it is anticipated that some local people will be employed as unskilled worke rs. This in turn will empower the local people with additional household income. In some cases , it will be the community organizations themselves through the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE) who will take the lead in the employment of the workers at each canal level. The significance of the impact is medium because of high unemployment in the project area and will be for the entire canal rehabilitation duration. The impact will be experienced within and around the project site. At this juncture, it is n ot easy to state the exact number of jobs that shall be created until the bills of quantities have been made by the engineering design group of the consultancy. The involvement of women would also arise from the provision of services during the rehabilitat ion phase through direct employment of women for light manual works and indirect services to the labour force through sale of food stuffs and snacks (sweet potatoes, roasted and cooked green maize, groundnuts etc). Through the process women, will be financ ially empowered enabling them to desist from the illicit sexual activities that may contribute to the incidence of HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 188 The other positive impact related to employment generation will be emergence of new tra ders taking advantage of the available opportunities to sell more produce to Leului, Sefula, Mongu and Limulunga markets. This positive and indirect impact will result in increased household incomes and it is therefore of medium significance. The social s urvey discovered that Lubitamei canal, once important for transportation of building poles and roofing grass from the uplands of the Simulumbe plains along the Lusaka/Mongu road via Ndiki plains is likely to regain its significance after rehabilitation. Similarly, the rehabilitation will improve the movement of goods from the upland areas into the Barotse Flood Plain . MEASURES TO ENHANCE P OSITIVE IMPACT During the rehabilitation of the six selected priority canals the Project developer should give preference to locals for unskilled jobs during the rehabilitation of the six selected priority canals. This has far reaching implications on the survival abilities of the affected persons in view of the depressed employment opportunities in the project area due to its remoteness. In order to increase employment opportunities in the project area, the respective district councils of Nalolo, Mongu and Limulunga should enhance training in self -help programmes in order to improve the quality of life of the local communit ies. This training must be done in collaboration with the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE) in order to sustain the process of clearing the canals after the payment for labour has been completed. 6.3.11.2 Increased agricultural production IMPACT ASSESSMENT It was observed throughout the social survey that rice and maize were very important crops along the six selected priority canals and cassava has the third position of importance. With the drainage and free movement of water through the rehabilitated canals, more land will be drained and become available for rice and maize cultivation with a likelihood of increased productivity. These are positive impacts with short and long -term effects on society. MEASURES TO ENHANCE P OSITIVE IMPACT The positive impact likely to be created by the rehabilitation of the six priority canals can be enhanced by providing technical and entrepreneurship skills to farmers in the areas and making it easier for them to access agricultural inputs and credit. This can be achieved if the Min istry of Agriculture and Livestock puts in place a mechanism to train farmers in improved agricultural production practices and entrepreurnship skills Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 189 6.3.11.3 Increased volumes of goods transported on canals IMPACT ASSESSMENT The rehabilitation of the six priorit y canals will impact positively on the transportation of agricultural produce (rice), fish and forest products through increased volumes of cargo on canoes and reduced transportation costs incurred when using alternative transport means (Ox -carts). Current ly the private sector involved in buying rice only reach accessible areas in the Barotse Flood Plain, but with the improved canal water transport system, they will be able to reach even the furthest places where crops in the past were not purchased. This w ill ultimately contribute to increased agricultural efficiency as inputs and outputs will get to production areas and markets. The rehabilitation of the canals will have a long -term positive impact. MEASURES TO ENHANCE P OSITIVE IMPACT This positive impact which will generate immediate effects on the local economies can be enhanced further by empowering local youth with entrepreneurship skills and financial capacity to invest in large canoes and boats. 6.3.11.4 Improved fish production in the Barotse Flood Plain IMPACT ASSESSMENT Presently the canal network in the Barotse Flood Plain is difficult to use as some portions are blocked since they have not been cleared for decades. Therefore in their current state, the canals cannot be used by Fisheries Department for eff ective monitoring of fishing methods and enforcement of the annual fish ban. As a result of illegal method , fish catches in the Barotse Flood Plain have fallen in the last decade. Illegal methods of fishing, using mosquito nets and Malelo, are used in the breeding grounds and this was reportedly rampant in the Lubitamei canal around Mombo Hill. Therefore, the rehabilitation of the six canals could enable the Department of Fisheries to enforce the fish ban and implement the Fisheries Co -Management program d esigned to re -stock the Barotse Flood Plain fishery given they have sufficient human capacity to enforce the fish ban . The resulting improved fish production is a potential positive impact of high significance with medium term effect. MEASURES TO ENHANCE POSITIVE IMPACT This positive impact can be enhanced through sensitization of the fishing communities on matters of fish conservation, sustainable harvesting and resting breeding grounds as well as implementing the Fisheries Co -Management programme which seeks to check the downward trend in fish production of the entire Zambezi Flood Plain and its tributaries fisheries of the Luena Flats. This collaborative programme is achievable with strengthened cooperation between government, traditional authorities (the BRE) and fishermen . 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 190 6.3.11.5 Increased local tourism IMPACT ASSESSMENT The Kuomboka ceremony and Kufuluhela ceremonies, that take place on the Muoyowamo canal, have become important tourist attractions that have put Zambia on the international tourism map. Accor ding to the Zambia National Tourist Board, the Kuomboka ceremony alone attracts over 100,000 tourists to the Western Province every year generating foreign exchange earnings for the country and significantly contributing to the economy of Mongu district. I ts rehabilitation therefore, will also impact positively on the tourism potential held by such cultural and historical sites as Lwatile Church, Old Boma Site and Lealui Palace. Similarly, the rehabilitation of Lubitamei canal is likely to impact positivel y on the tourist potential of the late King Lewanika's sugar cane farm, a cultural site associated with the construction of the same canal, and Kate, a beautiful site designated for establishment of the new Limulunga District Centre. MEASURE TO ENHANCE PO SITIVE IMPACT This positive impact, with significant long -term effects on the economy of the newly established districts of Limulunga and that of Mongu in the short term can be enhanced by enabling investments in hospitality businesses within the Barotse Fl ood Plain . 6.3.11.6 Improved access to health facilities and enhanced human health IMPACT ASSESSMENT Most of the people living in the Barotse Flood Plain have difficulties in accessing medical facilities that are only found on the uplands in Limulunga, Mongu, Seful a and Namushakende due to poor transport network. With a rehabilitated network of canals, their inhabitants in the Barotse Flood Plain will be able to access health services easily and at reduced cost by canoe or boat. Even the few rural health facilities located in the Flood Plain who use bicycles to obtain their monthly drug requirements will benefit from canal rehabilitation as it will become easier to bring in medical supplies easily. These are direct, positive and highly significant impacts given the l imited number of health facilities in the Barotse Flood Plain and poor roads. MEASURE TO ENHANCE PO SITIVE IMPACT These positive impacts with long -term social and economic benefits to the communities and country at large can be enhanced by introducing mobil e health services to carter for settlements far from existing facilities using canal transport which is faster and cheaper as compared to road transport . 6.3.11.7 Increase in trade and incomes IMPACT ASSESSMENT Rehabilitation of the six priority canals will impact positively on the trade between the upland areas and the Barotse Flood Plain settlements through increased volumes of goods transported using rehabilitated canals. Currently it is costly to transport goods on the limited available ox carts, whose capacity is also limited and which takes a longer time to reach the intended destinations . 6. Impacts Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 191 MEASURE TO ENHANCE PO SITIVE IMPACT When operational, the rehabilitated canals network will increase trade between the Barotse Flood Plain and uplands areas. This will in turn contribute to increased incomes of the people. The impact of increased trade and incomes can be enhanced by empowering local people with entrepreneurship skills and financial capacity to expand their businesses . 7. Conclusion and recommendations Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 192 7. CONCLUSION AND RECOM MENDATIONS This ESIA has described both social, cultural and environmental baseline in the Study area. It has studied the potential changes to baseline brought from the Project implementation. The Lozi people are also known as the \"plains or water people\", and local livelihood s and cultural traditions are linked closely with seasonal flooding. The use of floodplain resources was in the past managed according to traditional systems, under the customary authority of the Litunga. Today, although formal control over natural resourc es has been passed over to central and provincial government, the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE) maintains a great influence on natural resource use and regulation. During the dry season, the bulk of local production, economic activities and settlement are focused in the floodplain area. As the plain becomes inundated, most of the population moves to the uplands and plain fringes. Most of the population in the Barotse Flood Plain depends on a mixed livelihood strategy, combining crop farming, livestock keeping, fishing and natural resource exploitation. This diversity of livelihood components, many of which depend on wetlands and canals, is an effective strategy for spreading risk, and income and subsistence sources vary at different times, especially ac cording to season. The rural economy is for the most part subsistence -based, and is subject to high levels of uncertainty and variability. The Barotse flood plain with its annual flood has allowed the creation of wetlands habitats that are valued for many wildlife species including fishes. Only few human settlements are present in the plain, which has help to preserve many habitats, population concentration along the plain fringes has however created environmental pressure of nearby wetlands. The study are a is poorly occupied by herbivores mammals, probably due to high incidence of subsistence hunting by local population. In fact, large terrestrial mammals are believed to be totally absent of the Eastern side of the Barotse plain. Bird presence in the plain are adjusted to the annual flood pattern, with receding water many wetlands are created that allow for great flocks of birds to forage. When the dry season is at its peak, many seasonal wetlands disappear and bird population decrease or concentrate along perennial wetlands and the rivers. Between the Zambezi -Malile area, and the wet grassland along the edge of the plateau lies a large strip of grassland savanna. This area is more occupied by human, with settlements and grazing cattle. It is the area with the lesser environmental value. In the plain trees are scares and there is no forest, the main reason being the annual floods. Along the edge of the plateau (plain fringes), riparian forests have been extensively replaced by mango tree culture leaving only few relictual riparian forests. In terms of plant species with special status, the area is not rich neither in endemicity nor in protected species. A few waterbirds have a special status, as well as other wetland dependent insects and amphibians such as the Mongu shovelnose frog. Since no inventory of the Mongu shovelnose frog has never been carried out, it is impossible to assess the probability that some specimen would be impacted. It is with today information also impossible to assess whether the floo dplain is a Critical Natural Habitat from the species (as defined in the OP 4.04 Natural Habitats). However, it has to be considered potentially present along or near canal to be rehabilitated and the plain has to be considered an important habitat. Fishes are specialized in slow moving and turbid water as found in canals. Important spawning grounds are located in riverine wetlands along the Zambezi and perennial wetlands close to the Malile. Fishes spawn in their emergent -leaved grasses. -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 193 Many positive impa cts will be brought by canal improvement since people's livelihood is closely related to the functions of the canal network in the plain, functions that have been deteriorated by poor maintenance and that need restoration. The main impacting activities wi ll be reshaping of canals with excavation (dredger or excavator). Reshaping of canals will improve drainage of wetlands, reducing their water retention capacity, thus reducing their ecological value for obligated wetlands plant species, amphibians and othe r water dependent wildlife. Reshaping of canals will however improve fish habitat continuity, which is a positive impact. Implementation of mitigation measures will not reduce significantly negative impacts. This is due to the fact that, besides best manag ement practices, they are limited actions during construction that can be implemented in order to reduce impacts. One element that is an absolute requirements is the avoidance of the delineated protection zone for the critical natural habitat of the Bande d Neolebias ( Neolebias lozii ) south of the Study area. Any work on Musiamo in the delineated area (Kataba River, Siandra stream and their associated dambos and wetlands) , will have major impact on the critically endangered species. Currently, the foreseen activities of this Project do not encroach in this area. However in the medium term, it is planned to recalibrate Musiamo further South, this has to be avoided in the fish habitat A special measure, that would bring long -term positive impacts on the floodp lain, is proposed in this ESIA: to develop a Comprehensive Wetland Delineation, Zoning and Management Plan. Being a Ramsar site, such a plan could be useful. Although Management plan is not a requirement for Ramsar sites, it is a recommended management too l. This option was presented during the third workshop and discussed in a group. Participants agreed that a management plan would be useful for the wetlands. The main recommendation from this ESIA is therefore to engage as soon as possible in developing a comprehensive wetland management plan for the plain. This plan could fill the gaps in scientific knowledge on ecology of the plain and could ensure sustainability of natural resources uses such as fishery. It would also define areas of high ecological val ue and implement a zoning of the plain. Implementing such plan would need specific expertise but could also be a mean to involve local knowledge such as scientists from the Barotseland University. This plan would call for redefining delineation of the curr ent Ramsar site by integrating wetlands around Lubitamei and the plateau lakes north of Mongu as well as the critical habitat of the Banded Neolebias fish (Kataba River, Siandra stream and their associated dambo and wetlands) . Development of this plan woul d necessitate external source of funds since it is out of the scope of the Study 8.

APPENDICES 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 220 12.1 ANNEX 1: MINUTES OF COMMUNITY CONSULTATIONS METHOD During consultative meetings with the local communities, the Socio -Economic Te am gave presentations on the project and also received the questions/concerns from the community on issues that should be considered during the canal rehabilitation project when it commences. One village per canal was interviewed. These discussions were centered on the following: To find out if the village inhabitants have heard about the canal project of the world Bank and the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ). What do they know about the history of the canal in their area? Have they been involv ed in maintaining the canal? How they are using the canals? Before restoring the canals, what do they think should be understood in terms of canals passing through important villages housing royal burial sites. What are the sources of livelihoods? How many people depend on the canals in the village? How important are the canals to the households and the community? What do they expect from the proposed canal rehabilitation project? What do they propose as a method of managing and maintaining the canals once they are rehabilitated? What they would not accept in terms of canals rehabilitation (mandatory labour work, community free work on the canals? What do the women do in terms of their daily calendars including the problems the women face in the flood plain and assess if the women's work load is heavy? Basically also the women involvement in the canal clearing tasks? What benefits do women get from the canals? The role of the youth in canal project and cross if the youth are moving out of the villages and als o look and understand if the population was increasing or decreasing in the villages? Lastly but not the least to understand the types infrastructure available such as schools, clinics and the accessibility in terms of distances. Learn in details about the sensitive areas (protected areas, graveyards, historical sites, etc.) Employment opportunities MUSIYAMO CANAL Scoping meeting at Sikuyu Village Present from NIRAS: Mr. Charles Chileya (NIRAS) and Mr. Mubiana Muliokela (Interpreter Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priori ty traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 221 In his introductory remarks, Mr. Charles Chileya informed the community that the Government of the Republic of Zambia has engaged BRL of and NIRA S of Zambia to undertake this Environmental and Social Impact Study ( ESIA) to try to change the picture and get to the grass root beneficiaries before the project starts. Mr Chileya went on to encourage the people present to be as open as possible as the meeting has no structured questionnaire which will quote them. He enco uraged members to be free and comfortable to discuss matters regarding canal rehabilitation . The Chairman of the meeting from the village thanked the group for the initiative and hoped that the discussions were going to be fruitful as the meeting affected the rehabilitation of the Musiyamo canal which was one of the important assets the local villages depended for most of their basic needs. During the discussions, the following were noted. All the twenty -four village members present had heard of the propose d rehabilitation of the six selected canals. It was also reported that they heard that the canals were dug by one of the Litungas though they could not specifically say which one and the year the canal was dug. All the villages along the Musiyamo canal are involved in the clearing of their part of the canal. The people reported using the canal for bathing, washing clothes, irrigation, watering cattle and fishing with baskets. The community would willingly participate in the clearing of the Musiyamo canal i f the government provided incentives. Some of them hoped dredgers will be used so that a good depth is attained and ensure the dredged sand and silt were not left on the canal edges but spread a distance away. Most villagers reported that they have heard t hat in some parts of Zambia, they have such dredgers that are able to dredge sand some fifty or more meters away from the canals. The community noted that they expect to have good harvests on rice because their fields will have no more floods once they are cleared properly. In terms of maintaining the canal they noted that it is important that the BRE is closely involved as they can supervise the clearing after the government deepens the canals. The BRE can lead the people in cleaning the canals. It was rep orted that the most important usage of the Musiyamo canal are interception of water from the uplands, drainage, watering livestock, transportation and irrigation. Women in the village reported that woke up at around 05.00 hours every day and they go to bed between 20.00 hours and 22.00 hours depending on the household chores they want to complete on that particular day. The women complained that lack of clean water and poor sanitation were big constraints along all the villages on the Musiyamo canal. During the rainy season, people resort to using the bush. They have persistent diarrhea with young children being adversely affected. Few homesteads and villages have protected wells. Most of the houses along the Musiyamo canal are made out of pole and mud while toilets are made of reeds. Clinics and schools are all located on the uplands in Limulunga and children walk 5 -10 Kilometre distances to access these. The youth reported that they have no intentions of leaving the villages as these are their ancestral homes and would love to live along the Musiyamo canal like their parents have done. However, they need good facilities to make their stay easy. They also noted that population along the canal is increasing a bit. Women complained that their workloads were to o heavy. There were no women clubs through which they can access empowerment schemes or indeed promotetheir development agenda. On the contrary, women around Limulunga have women clubs and are able to access inputs for farming. The communities along the Mu siyamo see the challenge in the area as being poor toilets and housing . Scoping meeting at Sikuyu Village along the Musyamo Canal, 27th November 2013 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 222 Present from NIRAS: Mr. Charles Chileya (NIRAS) and Mr. Mubiana Muliokela (Interpreter and Research Assis tant) Community Members present: confidential In his introductory remarks, Mr. Charles Chileya informed the community that time and again projects in most parts of the country failed to materialize due to Government's poor logistics and sensitization. There is a general feeling that Government has always developed cold feet on projects implemented in most parts of the country. It is for this reason, that the Government of the Republic of Zambia has engaged BRL of and NIRAs of Zambia to undertake this Enviro nmental and Social Impact Study (ESIA) to try to change the picture and get to the grass root beneficiaries before the project starts. Mr Chileya went on to encourage the people present to be as open as possible as the meeting had no structured questionnai re. The Chairman of the meeting from the village thanked the group for the initiative and hoped that the discussions were going to be fruitful as the meeting affected the rehabilitation of the Musyamo canal which was one of the important assets the local villages depended on for most of their basic needs. Discussions yielded the following information: most people had heard about the proposed canal rehabilitation project, people knew something about the history of canals in the floodplain, that successive Lozi kings constructed the canals using compulsory labour mobilized within the kingdom, and that people living along the canal are involved in canal maintenance. They revealed that the main uses of the Musyamo canal were bathing, washing clothes, irrigatin g gardens, watering cattle and fishing with baskets. The community would willingly participate in the clearing of the Musyamo canal if the government provided incentives. Some of them hoped dredgers will be used so that a good depth is obtained and ensure the dredged sand and silt were not left on the canal edges but spread a distance away. Most villagers reported that they have heard that in some parts of Zambia, they have such dredgers that are able to dredge sand some fifty or more meters away from the canals. The community mentioned that they expected to realize good rice harvests after the canal's rehabilitationon as it will be easier to control floods. As for canal maintenance, most people were of the view that they needed to participate as it was for their own benefit. They were also of the view that the traditional leadership together with the BRE be responsible for canal maintenance after rehabilitation. They revealed that the Musyamo canal is mainly used to intercept surface water from the uplands, drainage of the plain edge, watering livestock, transportation and irrigation. Women in the village reported that they woke up around 05.00 hours every day and they go to bed between 20.00 hours and 22.00 hours depending on the amount of household chores to be completed on a particular day. People complained that lack of clean water and poor sanitation were big constraints in all the villages along the Musyamo canal. During the rainy season, people resort to using the bush as toilets. They have persistent diarrhea with young children the worst affected. Few homesteads and villages have protected wells. Most of the houses along the Musyamo canal are made out of pole and mud while toilets are made of reeds. Clinics and schools are all located on the uplands i n Limulunga and children walk 5 -10 Kilometre distances to access these. Most of the youth in the area do not intend to leave as they consider it their ancestral home and would love to continue living along the Musyamo canal like their parents. However, th ey were quick to point out that there was need for good social facilities to make life in the floodplain more bearable. They also noted that population along the canal is increasing a bit. Women complained that their workloads were too heavy. There were no women clubs in floodplain villages, which could help them to access much needed empowerment resources to raise their economic status. On the contrary, women around Limulunga have women clubs and are able to access inputs for farming. Poor housing is anoth er challenge observed among the majority of households along Musyamo canal Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 223 Scoping meeting held at Namboata Village (central place) and included Nasisholo, Kembi and Nakalenge villages, along the Musyamo Canal around the Namushakende Farmer Training Centre, 1stFebruary Christoph (Research Assistant for NIRAs) and Mr. G. Sitali, Camp Extension Officer Community Members present: confidential The meeting opened with a prayer from one of the participants. Thereafter, Mr. Charles Kapekele Chileya went on to explain the purpose of their visit and thanked the people for having assembled to meet and discuss the proposed canal rehabilitation. He urged people to feel free a nd raise pertinent issues that can help the rehabilitation of the six priority major canals in the Barotse Flood Plain under the PPCR project implemented by the Ministry of Finance and National Planning. The meeting noted that they heard about the rehabil itation of the canals through the radio during the time the Minister of Finance came to Mongu early in 2013 to sign a loan with the World Bank representative for the rehabilitation of the canals. They went further to argue that they recently saw surveyors measuring the width and length of the canals in the area. They also knew from their history that King Lewanika was the first Litunga to initiate construction of canals for draining the land in order for people to cultivate crops in the flood plain. It did work well during the reign of Litunga Lewanika as productivity increased and cultivated area expanded. People present also remembered that the Musyamo canal was last rehabilitated in 1970 by government. The people who participated in the rehabilitation exe rcise were paid cash or given food. This spirit has made everyone expect to be paid something for any work done. The people use the canal as a source of water for irrigating vegetables, soaking cassava, drinking water, bathing, watering livestock and tran sportation. The meeting also revealed that there was no burial site along the canal that might affect rehabilitation works. It was further observed that 100% of the total inhabitants obtain their livelihoods from the canal in the four villages we interview ed during the scoping meeting.The communities only cleared the portions of the canal where they bath and soak their cassava. There is no coordinated clearing of the canal now. Each village does what they feel is important to their benefit. During canal reh abilitation, people are expecting to be employed as a way of deriving tangible benefits from the project. Some sections of Musyamo canal have mud and may require the use of dredging machines. These sections are at Nasisholo, Kembi, Namakomena and Namakeka Villages. These villages have muddy soils that are difficulty to work using hand tools. However, local people at a fee should clear some parts of the canal by hand, as they are not willing to provide free labour. They would like to work for cash and there after continue to maintain the canals without being paid. The people proposed that necessary tools be provided to the Disaster Management Committee at local level, which coordinates development projects on the ground. The DMMU satellite committee in the f our villages was reportedly very hard working and tends to have the capacity to mobilize the people in conjunction with the BRE without problems. Women in the villages interviewed like in most parts of the Barotse Flood Plain have heavy work loads. They wa ke up around 05.00 hours and set off for the upland fields (Matema) fields until about 13.00 hours when they return to prepare lunch and rest a while. About 15:00 hours they again set off for the flood plain gardens (Sitapa) where they work untill 18.00 ho urs when they return home to prepare supper for the family. They continue with other household chores until they retire to bed around 21.00 hours every day. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessme nt for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 224 Women reported that apart from their heavy workload, they also face other challenges, which affect their lives. People reported that Open Defecation was a normal practice in many households. During the rainy season, all the human and animal wastes in the area are washed into the Musyamo canal contaminating the water and resulting in high incidences of d iarrhea. The incidence of malaria is high due to stagnant water in the Musyamo canal. The high rates of morbidity experienced in the area impact the girl child she is required to stay at home to take care of the sick and perform household tasks. Women were also worried at the high rates of illicit beer drinking among males. This not only poses a danger to the health but also to labour availability and productivity. There are no permanent bridges across the Musyamo and women reported that they find it diffic ult to cross the makeshift bridges as they go to the fields in the plain. It is the wish of the people that when the rehabilitation of the canals is being done, consideration should be made to construct bridges across the canal. The issue of orphans came u p as one of the new challenge affecting women -headed households as they have additional responsibility to look after children left behind by sons and daughters who die from HIV/AIDS -related illnesses. Populations seem to be increasing in the villages visit ed during the scoping meetings. Young men and women are not migrating due to lack of employment opportunities in the urban areas. Some young men confessed during the meeting that they had attempted to go to look for jobs in the towns and returned without s uccess. On the land tenure system, community members mentioned that land for settlement is available although there are a few incidences of people renting some small pieces of fertile land on mounds (Mazulus) and Sitapas at relatively high fees. On average , one can rent an acre of land on a Lizulu for at ZMW 300 per year. The practice of renting is not common on the upland due to its infertile status. In general, the Litunga owns the land on behalf of the people and everyone has access to it. The walking d istance to the nearest school is one hour thirty minutes (90 minutes) which translates into 3 -4 Kilometers. The nearest school is Liunga Basic School located between the villages interviewed and Namushakende Farmers Training Centre. The nearest clinics are Namushakende Rural Health Center, about 5 Kilometers to the south and Sefula Rural Health Center, 7 Kilometers to the North. Scoping meeting at Situlu Village along the Musyamo canal, 29th November 2013 In attendance were Mr. Charles Kapekele Chileya and Mr. Mubiana Muliokela from NIRAS Zambia who were facilitating the scoping meeting in Situlu village. Mr. Charles Kapekele Chileya started by introducing his team which included Mr. Mubiana Muliokela and Maimbolwa Mukelebai who were acting as Guide and Int erpretor respectively to the Socio - Economic Team of the BRL of France and NIRAS Zambia Limited. The people reported that they were not aware of the project on the rehabilitation of the canal. As to the history of canals in the Barotse Flood Plain, they ac knowledged the fact that King Lewanika initiated the construction of canals for the purposes of reclaiming land for farming in the 1890s. Since the Litunga built the canals, most Lozi people have been involved in maintaining them. The King is known to have used compulsory labour. Village headmen were required to mobilize subjects to clear their portions of the canals and if this was not done the whole village was punished. In addition, any husband who fought his wife or anyone who formented trouble in the community was punished by working on the canal under the supervision of a Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 225 After independence, the government of the United National Independence Party (UNIP) abolished the system of compulsory labour. The new government establish ed a Ministry responsible for Water Affairs, which took over the functions of maintaining the canals through wage labour. This continued for sometime until the government started to fail in financing canal clearing and in recent times the responsibility wa s transferred to the Office of the Vice President's Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU). Through Food For Work Programme the DMMU has been ble to maintain important canals occasionally. Other institutions such as Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) have come into the clearing and cleaning of the canals through food for work programmes. Notable among these has been Concern Worldwide International. The people mentioned that there was another canal called Nonge that flows into the Musyamo canal. They considered Nonge as an important canal that should be considered for rehabilitation, too. Nonge flows into the Luena River and there it becomes Mapuwa. They also mentioned that Lubitamei originates from Nonge and flows into the Zambezi River at Mbanik elako. Mbanikelako is home to a village called \"Ilalamupa\", believed to have been established by King Lewanika as a winter capital. People reported that they used Musyamo canal as a source of drinking water, washing, irrigating winter maize and vegetable g ardens as well rice fields. There are no sites of cultural importance along that can hinder rehabilitation works. They all reported that 100% of the people living in the village depend on the Musyamo for their livelihoods. When the rehabilitation starts, the local people expect to get some employment from the project. They also forsee that the Musyamo will have fast flowing water and will also contribute to more land for farming being drained and there by increasing agricultural productivity in the village .Fishing will be more in the village as the water will be flowing from very far. Bridges should bebuilt for animals and human beings to cross to the flood plain for grazing and farming respectively. They propose that the Musyamo be worked on by the local people using appropriate tools. However, the project should describe the depths and width for the local people to follow when rehabilitating the Musyamo. There are some portions of the Musyamo that need to be rehabilitated with machinery. There are places which has mud and sand and this needs machinery to open them up. The local people would not do the rehabilitation for free but they should be paid by the project and in future, the modalities for voluntary cleaning and clearing will be agreed upon by the BRE and the local people. For this reason, the BRE ought to be part and parcel of the planning process for the rehabilitation of the Musyamo canal., The NGOs working on the canals in Barotse Flood Plain is engaging people through food for work. On the wo men's work load, the women present noted that there work loads were too heavy in the village. Their daily work start as early as 05.00 hours when they set off for the field. Come back around 13.00 hours and prepare lunch for the homestead. Rest a bit and t hen go back for round 2 around 15.00 hours and return back to the villahe around 18.00 hours to start to make arrangements for supper. They retire to bed between 20.00 to 22 hours depending on the work they have to do in the evening. Women thought that the re is need to introduce some technologies such as hammer mills to lessen the burden of pounding cassava forexample. The problem was more so for the female headed households who are not in a position to cultivate big portion of land but small portions which give them very little harvests. There are no women associations in the area except for the women Christian fellowship which meets to discuss Bible study as opposed to development issues in the area. They also complained of the challenges they face. There are no safe water points where to draw water for their homesteads. They get water from the blocked Musyamo canal or the scoop wells that they dug along the canal. The animals, cattle, pigs and dogs use these water sources. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 226 Due to the poor water they drink, there is a lot of malaria and diarrheal in the village. Pitlatrines are not in existence. All they have are small pits built with grass and not permanently thatched. With the onset of rains, these toilets are easily sub merged in water and causes problems to the health status of the people in the village. The other problem was the long distances to the nearest schools and clinic. The nearest school of the Catholic school, Mupatu in St. Lawrence Mission which is 5 kilometers away from Situlu village. The cl inic is about 6 kilometers. Maternity problems frequently occur due to the long distances to the nearest clinic. The problem of the lack of rice market was reported by both men and women in the meeting. There are no oxcarts for transportation of the produc e to the nearest town markets like Mongu. The population is increasing and a few young men are migrating to the near by towns of Mongu, Senanga and Kaoma to look for employment opportunity. These are few in umbers as most youn men are still in the village. It was also reported that most people at the age of 20 are married and have started producing children. The housing is in bad state. The houses are built of grass -thatched houses. A few well to do households have iron sheets on the roofs but these are few and countable. On the land tenure they are of the view, that land is owned by the Mulena on behalf of the local people. The people can ask for land to be allocated to them through the local Silalo Induna and this is not a big problem. Once land is alloca ted to someone, nobody can grab it from that person. The children will come to inherit their parent's land upon the demise of the head of household and it is the first borne child who takes over and distributes the land to the other siblings in the same fa mily. \"The land issue in the Barotse Flood Plain is straight forward we allhave own lands left by our fore fathers and know the boundarie, we only lack the equipment to till the land in the plain as our soils are very hard and sandy\"... said one woman in the audience Scoping Meeting at Mikuyu Village along the Musyamo Canal on the 30th November 2013 Mr. Charles Kapekele Chileya, Mr. Mubiana Muliokela from NIRAS Zambia as consultants. The meeting opened with a prayer from one of the participants. After the p rayer, Mr. Charles Kapekele Chileya explained thepurpose of the gathering to enable participants feel confortable when presenting issues and puttinh up points. He reminded the participants that there are no correct or wrong answers and no name will be ment ioned in the paper as to whosaid what during the discussions. He ended his introduction by giving the synopsis of the objectives of the canal rehabilitation project in the area being implemented by the Zambian government through the PPCR Secretariat in the Ministry of Finance and National Planning. The meeting acknowledged knowing abou the project. However, they were not aware of the history of canals in the Barotse Flood Plain as they are all young people who have just inherited the land from their dead pa rents. They reported having been involved in the clearing of the Musyamo canal in the recent past through the food for work progrmme. They were engaged to work on the canal in exchange for maize, beans and cooking oil by the Vice President's Office Disaste r Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU). They were suing shovels and hoes to clear the Musyamo canal. They are using the Musyamo cana for draining purposes, fishing, bathing, soaking cassava, watering crops for the vegetable gardens, water for animals and transportation. However, the major livelihood is farming among almost all households and this represents 100% of the people using the Musyamo / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 227 The meeting noted that during the rehabilitation of the Musyamo canal, it is imperative that bridges are provided for to make ease crossing for the people and the livestock. Most important is the fact that there is need to stop people blocking the Musyamo through fish traps in order to catch fish. The malelo type of fishing is blocking the flow o f water in the Musyamo canal. People in the village would not clear the canals for free. They expect to be paid for clearing the canals. They also expect employment from the rehabilitation exercise. They also expect that the government wil have the plan to support the clearing of the Musyamo canal on a more permanent basis as compared to now when only the Muyowamo has received great attention may be dueits political plays it has in the country's tourism calendar. They proposed that the Musyamo canal should be rehabilitated by the local people using the tools they have used before and not big machines. There may be portions that are blocked where a caterpillar can be used but on the whole the local people should clear the canal. Except that they need to be to ld of the width and the depth they should dig by the Engineers from Maritime Department at the Mongu Harbour. It was reported that there no cultural nor burial sites on the Musyamo Canal that can hinder the clearing of the canal. It was emphasized that the re is need for the project to involve the BRE from the beginning so that the future clearing of the canals is planned in each village with the local Silao Indunas. The project should understand that in Western Province, the BRE plays a fundamental role in sustaining development. On the gender aspects, it was reported that women in Mikuyu village start their day around 05.00 hours every day. At 06.00 hours they set off for the field. This is after having done some household chores like cleaning the surroundi ng, fetching water for drinking and cooking when they return back from the field in the afternoon. They return around 13.00 hours to organize the lunch and rest a bit and then go back to the fields around 15.00 hours. They return from the field around 18.0 0 hours to start making supper. They go to bed between 21.00 and 22.00 hours. Women mainly obtain their revenue from sale of vegetables as the sale of rice and cattle are dominated by the men in the area.The women also pointed that there is no transport t o the field and during the floods they drink contaminated water due to the lack of protected water wells in the village. It becomes practically impossible for the people to do agricultural work as the fields are normally flooded. On the population trend, it was noted that population is increasing. Many youths are doing nothing and they see children production as one of the tasks they perform in the village.The youth haveno intentions of oing to towns to look for jobs as they have already failed to get the jobs in the neighbouring Mongu township. Thei houses are constructed of mud, wooden poles and grass -thatched.There are no toilets but temporary pitlatrines. When it rains, these pitlatrines collapse and their feacal contents washed away into the Musyamo ca nal. This means that people drink contaminated water contributing toi the high incidences of diarrhea. To attain a semblance of normality, people in the area need improved housing and sanitation facilities. The nearest school is the Community School at Isa mbai 2 kilometers away. The people mentioned that Isambai Shool is just a Community School built by the Villages and has just received four teachers recently. The people then have to send their children for upper primary school to Ushaa which is 9 Kilomete rs away. The children in the final analysis drop off after grade 4 as they are not willing to move 18 Kilometers every day from grade 5 to 9 until they are selected to go to Senior Secondary School. Ushaa is a Basic school up to grade 9. The people wished that the government will consider building a Basic School at Isambai and a Rural Health facility. 12.

According to them, it is within the realms, traditions that no Lozi can be land less, and hence the reason why the Litunga would not issue a 99 year lease to any person. Land is owned by the Litunga in behalf of the people and families arelocated land that they can use permanently during their lives and after their death their children would inherit the land. p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 229 MUYOWAMO CANAL Scoping meeting held at Ikakuyu Village along the Muoy owamo Canal Present from NIRAS: Mr. Charles Chileya, Mr. Mubiana Muliokela Community Members present: confidential After personal introductions led by Mr. Charles Chileya, the group went straight into discussions and noted that every member of the village present was aware of the proposed canal rehabilitation project. The local Councilor had been mentioning it to the people in his Ward. The community also knew something about the Muoyowamo canal as it is the canal used every year by the Litunga during the Kuomboka ceremony and it is one of the most important canals as it attracts tourists to the Western Province. None of the community members remembered the year when it was dug but only reported that from the oral tales by the old people, that it was constr ucted by one Litunga who had a vision of draining the Barotse Floodplain for promoting agriculture and controlling the floods and that it was dug using compulsory labour. The government does the dredging of the canal with cash contribution sometimes with t he participation of the local people especially just before the Kuomboka ceremony. All the villages living along this canal are mobilized by the local Indunas to help out in the clearing and the BRE plays a very significant role in the mobilization of the village headmen. The BRE punishes villages with monetary fines if absent. The community living along the Muoyowamo thought that the BRE has a lot of influence if well involved in mobilizing local people. It was felt that given its political connections, Muoyowamo is one of the few canals that is well maintained by both the government and the BRE. During the meeting it was noted that every household living around the canal depended on it and, therefore, has a special position to the lives of the people. Muoy owamo canal connects Limulunga and Lealui, the two most important villages in Barotseland. The people were also of the view that the government needed to hire someone with proper equipment to dredge the canal as the current professionals, Maritime Departme nt is using very basic Excavators from Finland called Water Master which throws the dredged soil and silt just a few meters from the edge of which materials are washed back when it rains. \"we would like the government to stop using old equipment they are u sing to clear our canal during Kuomboka....\" One woman from Likomokelo Village contributed. The meeting agreed that thereafter, the community will have it easy to clear the canal as all the sand will never come back to the canal. The government should engage the local people when selecting the machines to dredge the canals. \"We in Barotseland, we are very educated and we know that equipment from Continental Europe is stronger than the Scandinavian countries when it comes to dredging. When I worked under KK, h e would never allow to import excavators as dredgers. It is new Governments of MMD and PF that can allow the excavators. I worked at Mulambwa Harbour for twenty years.\" said the Village Headman, who happened to be a retired civil servant during the first republic of Kenneth Kaunda in the Ministry of Transport and Communication. The meeting gave the chance to the women present to answer questions related to the women. One woman stood up and said \"Women are forced to wake up as early 4 or 5 am every day in or der to start sweeping their household surroundings. They leave their spouses sleeping as their job during this time is to just plough tracks of land for us with their oxen and leave us with our babies at the back to break the clods. We sometimes go back to the fields in order to finish preparing the land quickly before the onset of rains.\" Others verified this statement that showed a heavier workload for women in the villages around the Muoyowamo canal. The women noted that there are some women clubs and wo men associations in the area but they are concentrated in Limulunga and Lealui only. Women also reported that they are also involved in canal clearing. They use cycles to cut the grass while their men use shovels and picks to remove the sand. Women and chi ldren use the canal for fishing with baskets. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 230 The meeting noted that the population was increasing in the area and attributed this to people not practicing family planning. On migration, they noted that there are very few young men leaving the Floodplain e xcept those going to colleges and universities. Muoyowamo has three basic schools; one in Lealui and three in Limulunga and the distances to schools and clinics in both Lealui and Limulunga is about 5 kilometers. The major problems they have are the poor s tate of toilets and poor housing made out of mud and pole. There being no other business to discuss, the meeting ended at 15.30 hours and Mr. Charles Chileya thanked the community for their contribution and wished them good luck as the project starts to up lift their life styles in the Barotse Flood Plain. Nalutimbo and Nateo villages scoping meeting, 30th January 2014, along Ikwichi/Namitome/Muoyowamo canal The scoping meeting was held at Nalutimbo for the two villages along the plain edge of the Muoyowamo . Ikwichi area is located along the Namitome canal that passes behind the Moombo Hill and flows into the Muoyowamo canal near Limulunga. Besides the visiting consulting team, there were 22 people in attendance Mr Chileya began the meeting by introducing h imself and members of his team membersbefore explaining the purpose of their visit to the araea. He urged the people to feel at liberty as they deliberate and informed them that all responses from the deliberations were going to be yaken note of, but that no one was going to be quoted by name. Mr. Konoso Konoso, who chaired the meeting, also welcomed Mr. Chileya and his team on behalf of the Silalo Induna. The majority of people in attendance were aware of the proposed canal rehabilitation project. The Village Headman had even been present at the project signing ceremony held in Mongu. According to community members, the history of canals in the Barotse Floodplain is traced back to the reign of the famous Lozi King, Lewanika, in the late 19th century when he first constructed Namitome canal that led to his Mushati Farm where he grew sugar cane. Mushati is the Lozi name for sugarcane. In order to ensure the Nalikwanda barge was not stuck during the Kuomboka, he diverted floodwaters from upstreams into the Mu oyowamo canal using the Namitome canal. The Nalikwanda was a big boat used by the King during Kuomboka. The construction of the Namitome canal resulted in the draining of large tracks of fertile land that became available agriculture purposes. Regarding th e methods to be employed in the proposed rehabilitation, the community suggested that heavy machinery be used because there is too much sand that has been deposited over the years and that this method would be more effective and efficient. With respect to canal maintenance, the people reported that past kings organized people in villages to clear the portion of the canal that fell within their village boundary and that it was mandatory and anyone failing to do the needful would be punished if reported. Most people were obliged to do the king's bidding because punishment was usually a fine of one cow. The community revealed that the system worked well as the King's Induna responsible for canals would physically supervise the clearing and take a written report to the King. After independence, the new government took over the responsibility of canal maintenance using paid labour and this approach destroyed the old system of using free labour that King Lewanika had established. People recalled that Namitome can al was last cleared in 1968. After 1991, the new Movement for Multi Party Democracy -led government introduced the food -for-work approach to rehabilitate canals. This did not promote community responsibility as well, because people were still being paid for clearing their own canals. p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 231 The discussion further revealed that construction of canals led to draining of inundated lands and this contributed to increased agricultural output in the floodplain at the time. People in the area grow rice, maize, vegetables , sweet potatoes, mangoes, sugar cane, quavas, bananas, pineapples, oranges, tangerines, bambaranuts and cowpeas. Cattle, goats and pig rearing is another source of livelihood. Cassava in the area is prone to Cassava Mosaic Virus (Nyamomboto). Maize yields were reportedly low and this could be because of lack of fertilizers and improved seed. The major sources of household income are beer brewing, charcoal burning, selling construction poles, rice trading and selling vegetables. TChaarcoal and poles are tra nsported by ox -cart to Limulunga and Mongu for sale. People in the area use the canal as a source of domestic water, for bathing, washing clothes and watering livestock. The canal has no sites of cultural importance along its course. The discussion reveale d that all the inhabitants in the area depend on the canal for their livelihood. There are no protected water wells in the area and many households do not have improved toilets. The poor sanitation is made even worse by the collapse of pit latrines during the rainy season because of the sandy nature of soils. The people in the area expect that the rehabilitation of canals will provide employment to the locals, increase farmland, make it possible to make fishponds and improve their standard of living. They also expect a proper bridge to be constructed at Ikwichi. The meeting recommended that the canal be rehabilitated using machines as some portions of the canal are hard and cannot be deepened using hand tools. They also proposed that after major rehabilitat ion, local headmen (Silalo Indunas) should be in the forefront of mobilizing people in maintaining the canal for free, and that the government empower communities with necessary tools like shovels, sickles, slashers and wheel barrows. Women in the area wak e up around 05:00 hours and begin the day by sweeping their homesteads before leaving for the upland fields by 06.00 hours. They usually return home about 13:00 hours to prepare for lunch. After 15:00 hours, they leave for the saana fields where they work until about 17.00 hours. Upon returning home, they start preparing for supper which is normally eaten around 19:00 hours. Most of them reported retiring to bed between 20:00 and 21:00 hours. There are no women groups or associations in the area. On the ot her hand, men reported waking up between 05:00 and 06:00 hours and begining their day by going to the Saana fields where they work up to about 10:00 hours returning home to rest and wait for lunch. They go back to the field or go to milk cows around 15:00 hours knocking off about 18:00 hours. Men usually went to bed around 21:00 hours. A few young people are moving out of the area to urban centers in search of jobs particularly those that successfully complete Grade 12, otherwise most young men remained i n the villages and continue to eke out what they could to survive. There is a health facility in the area and furthest village from the clinic is about 5 kilometers. The nearest school is at Mombo, about 7 Kilometers away. The major challenges identified d uring the meeting were flooding of rice and maize fields (which results in low yields and food insecurity) and lack of access to safe water supplies. With respect to land tenure, the area's inhabitants were faced with a big dilemma; the land they are occup ying belongs to a surviving princess (Mukwae) of one of the late kings. The people living here have access to regulated portions of the land but have no control over it. It would appear that people are not happy with this status quo, as they feel that they are caretakers only. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 232 Scoping meeting for Katoya and Nandopu Villages on 29thNovember 2013 along the Muoyowamo Canal The two villages came together at a central location for the scoping meeting. In attendance were Charles Chewe and Mubiana Muliokela from NIRAs Zambia Mr. Chewe explained the purpose of the team's visit, encouraged the people to contribute freely and that the meeting was important as it afforded the people an opportunity to bring out any issues about the proposed canal rehabilitation as it a ffected them. People reported that the major crops grown along the Muoyowamo canal in the area were rice (Supa variety), maize, pumpkins, sugarcane, cassava and sweet potatoes. Many of the elderly people said that they knew about the history of canals in Barotseland Flood Plain, that King Lewanika was behind their construction with the purpose of increasing food production through reclamation of arable land by draining the floodplain. People revealed that the Barote Royal Establishment currently supervise s the annual maintenance of the Muoyowamo canal before the Kuomboka Ceremony by people living along the canal and those villages that fail to participate are charged. It would appear that this is the only canal where people provide free labour during its m aintenance. The government was reportedly carrying out annual maintenance works on the canal before the Kuomboka Ceremony, too. Consultants also heard that there is another canal called Nonge that comes out of the Muoyowamo that needs rehabilitation as well. This canal links the Barotse Floodplain with the Luena flats, where it is known as Mupuwa canal. The local people in the area contended that the Lubitamei canal origates from Nonge and exits into the Zambezi River at Mbanikelako. Nonge canal is reputed to have 25 vilages along its course. The meeting revealed that there is an important village for the Litunga called \"Ilalamupa\", which village was like a winter capital during the reign of King Lewanika. Inhabitants listed the main uses of the Muoyowamo c anal as being farming, transportation of goods, the Kuomboka Ceremony (tourism use), watering cattle, source of drinking water, bathing and laundry, washing utensils, fishing and soaking cassava. The people also reported that fice fields adjacent to the Mu oyowamo canal normally have good yields in normal rain years. The water and sanitation situation in settlements along the Muoyowamo canal is relatively bad for the majority households. The homes in these settlements are made of mud and reeds with grass - thatched roofs. Pitlatrines predominate and are prone to submergence during floods. This poses a great challenge in terms of hygiene and safe water supply. A few well -to-do households have good permanent houses with improved toilets. People said that it was common for those living in temporary housing structures to be visited by crocodiles and snakes during floods. There was one protected well constructed by OXFAM in the area and it was said to be about 1 kilometer from the furthest village. The daily calend ar for women in the area begins at about 05.00 hours when they wake up, make a fire, and prepare breakfast if any, sweep the house and surroundings, then go to the Sitapa or Saana fields. They return home between 13.00 and 14.00 hours to prepare lunch and a brief rest before going back to the field around 15.00 hours to knock off about 17.00 hours. When they get home they go to bath and draw water then begin to prepare supper for the family retiring by 21:00 hours. The nearest school and clinic are in Limul unga, about 5 kilometers away. The distance poses a great challenge to young school -going children who have to make the return journey for five consecutive days each week. There is also another school at Mupatu another 5 Kilometers away. -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 233 During the floodi ng period, scoop holes where most villagers draw water for drinking and cooking become contaminated forcing girl children to walk the long distance to the nearby school to fetch. Many girls in the area drop out of school or fail to make it to secondary lev el. The cosultants also discovered during the meeting that household chores contributed to the poor performance at school among girls second only to illness that was a major reason for absenteeism. Though the men could not agree to the allegations that mos t of them prefer to send the boy child to school because education for the girl child is perceived as preparation for marriage. This was a debatable issue and women and men would not accept to be the proponents of the stigma. We ended up to the accusations only. There might be some truth looking at the number of young women married in the group. There is a women's club in the area although few women were members. Women are involved in clearing the canal, mainly removing siltation materials and grass dug by the men. Women complined that the 6 Km distance to the nearby health facility was a challenge in times of sickness and maternity cases and looked forward to a health facility being established within easy reach or mobile health services introduced in the a rea. The people in attendance expect to be employment during the canal's rehabilitation. They suggested that the canal be dredged with proper machinery that can throw the silt and sand far from the canal to prevent their being washed back into the canal d uring flooding. Some of the people also voiced concern over the practice of fishing using Malelo (Fish traps made by blocking water flow) and called for their discouragementd. The people revealed that the population in the area was increasing as attested by the large number of children. Consultants noted that youths who successfully graduated from local schools, usually left the village to pursue further education in nearby Limulunga, Mongu, Lusaka and the Copperbelt Provinces. It was also reported that th ere are plenty of early marriages that contributed to the population increase Scoping meeting held at of the Namitome a nd Muoyowamo canals, 30th January 2014 The village headmen agreed to the scoping meeting beeing held at Muchumbu village. In attendance were NIRAs Zambia, Mr. Mumbuna Mum buna, the headman, opened the meeting with an apology to the consultants for having brought all the participants together as the villages were too small to be visited singly. He hoped the measure would prove convenient to everybody. Mr. Chileya thanked the Village Headman for having made the consultant''s job easier by bringing all participants to one place. He told the gathering that they had come to discuss the proposed canal rehabilitation project in the Barotse Floodplain especially their expectations a nd potential roles. Many of the participants acknowledged hearing about the proposed canal rehabilitation project on the local radio station and that they knew something about the history on the canals in their area. According to the local people, the firs t canal to be constructed in the area was Sefula followed by Namitome and thereafter Nangula, which is also kmown as Lubitamei. Some elders at the meeting pointed out that the Lubitamei canal is called by different names along its course. Long after the d eath of King Lewanika, maintenance of canals in the Barotse Floodplain continued to be undertaken by local people under the supervision of the BRE. History has it that after Independence in 1964, the rehabilitation of canals became the responsibility of th e Department of Water Affairs who employed paid labour force for the exercise. Elders in attendance recalled that the last time the canal was rehabilitated using voluntary labour was in 1968. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 234 People use canals for irrigating winter crops, as a source of do mestic water, bathing, washing clothes, fishing and soaking cassava. The meeting noted that the majority of the inhabitants depended on the canal for their subsistence with livelihoods closely associated with the canals. The main sources of livelihood in the area include charcoal burning, cattle rearing and beer brewing. The inhabitants of Ikwichi area were of the view that their involvement in canal rehabilitation should be at a cost as has always been the case after the abolition of compulsory labour. The communities expect that the project will create employment opportunities for the youth and other able-bodied persons from the area, increase cultivatable land through draining, result in clean water flow and increased water supply during the dry seaso n. With water flowing in the canals, the people expect the breeding of mosquitoes to reduce with an associated reduction in the incidence of malaria, bilharzia, trachoma, ringworms, intestinal worms and skin rashes. Some people have proposed that Ikwichi B ridge be rebuild and expanded during the rehabilitation of the Lubitamei canal. They contend that this will allow maximum flow of water from the uplands. The majority of people in the area live in houses made of reeds, mud, poles with thatch grass. Some households in the area have pitlatrines made of grass while others have none. Like other womenfolk in the floodplain, the women in this area have similar daily routines that begin around 05:00 hours and end at about 20:00 -21:00 hours. Some of the constrai nts the gathering cited include long distances to schools and health facilities, lack of safe water sources, burden of keeping orphans, malaria and water borne diseases. According to women, there are no women clubs or associations in the area. The nearest primary school is at Mombo, 7 Km away. Accessibility to the school and health facility is usually poor during the rainy season because the raods get flooded. Parents reported that children most often absent themselves from school during this period. This s ituation may be one of the main contributing factors to the observed high rate of school drop out. Discussions also revealed that the land tenure system prevailing in the area does not favour the people because a princess owns most of the arable land. Peo ple have access to portions of it but have no control over it. There were sentiments that they were not happy with the arrangement because other people in the Barotse Floodplain have access to land for guaranteed long period. Scoping Meeting at Natwale Vi llage along the Muoyowamo Canal, 29th November 2013 Present were Mr. Charles Chewe and Mubiana Muliokela from NIRAS Zambia The meeting started with a prayer after which Mr. Chewe introduced himself and his colleague. He explained the purpose of their visit and urged people to answer the questions that he would be posed as earnestly as possible so that their views and expectation were captured. He also urged them to bring out any concerns and questions about the proposed canal rehabilitation project. The com munity knew about the project and the historical background of the Muoyowamo canal. Besides the Kuomboka ceremony, they cited transportation of goods and building materials from Limulunga to Lealui, fishing, bathing, washing clothes, watering cattle, and i rrigating such crops as vegetables, rice and winter maize as uses of the canal.. Many people admitted having participated on the clearing of the Muoyowamo canal for cash or food - for- work programme every year before the Kuomboka Ceremony. They also confirm ed working on the canal for free sometimes as demanded by Induans and that those that avoid it are collectively punished as a village. Incidences of a Village Headman being fined a cow are common and because of the fine most people prefer to work than be f ined. Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 235 The main crops grown in the area are maize (with MMV 441, MM 603, local as varieties), rice (with Supa, Xiang Zhou, kajaketi as varieties) and Angola. Rice is specifically grown as a cash crop in the village and it was reported to be the major incom e source for most households. \"No one can eat rice and claim he has eaten a meal, maize and cassava are our Lozi staples\" ...said one woman in the croud.. A cattle rearing was reported to be the most important livelihood activity for the village as it brings in very high incomes in case of a sale or slaughter. It was noted the 100% of the population all use the Muyowamo for their livelihood in Natwale Village. In trying to rank the livelihoods they obtain from the Muyowamo canal, the people provided the follo wing list: 1. Source of water for drinking in the homes 2. Fishing 3. Water for cattle 4. Kuomboka/transportation 5. Improved flow of water Other livelihood sources mentioned in the meeting was ox cart hire, which at the moment cost K50 per trip for 60 Kg bagof paddy rice. During the rehabilitation of the Muyowamo canal people are expecting to get employment. The Muyowamo will be clened and will have its water flowing into the Zambezi and thereby reduing the stagnance that is usually experienced around Limulunga and on the Junction of Nonge canal. The Muyowamo has only one cultural site at Leauli to allow the Lealui harbor to have the Nalikwanda pass through the canal during the Kuomboka. It is therefore important during the desgining of the rehabilitation of the Muyowa mo canal, this aspect is taken into consideration as the Nalikwanda starts off its journey from Leauli during Kuomboka and a provision of a good harbor at Leauli has to be considered by the designers. It was reported that the nearest social facilities were 3 to 4 Kilometers in Limulunga for both schools and clinic. Women in the village rise up at 05.00 hours and set off for their fields around 05.30 hours. They return back for lunch mid day at 12,00 hours. Do some domestic chores like fetching water and collecting of firewood to prepare lunch. It was noted that firewood is a big challenge in the plain. They sometimes depend on old mango trees that have been cut by their male counterparts. These mangoes are those that unproductive and have stopped bearing man goes that are usually chopped as firewood in the village. Otherwise, it has to be collected from the uplands by the women themselves. They go back to the fields after lunch after resting around 15.00 hours and return to the homestead around 17.00hours in r eadiness for supper. They eat around 19.00 hours and go to bed between 21.00 and 22.00 hours. Apart from the heavy load of work, the women have challenges in the village as they have no clubs for women talking about development or indeed spearheading incom e genegration projects for women. The women do not have pitlatrines and are forced to use the Open Defecation (OD). During the flooding, all the faecal materials are washed into the Muyowamo and people drink contaminated water thereby increasing the incide nces of diarrhea diseases in the village. Most of the houses in the area are typically constructed of reeds, mud and grass thatched. Nearly all the households in the area have pitlatrines that frequently collapse during the floods. Well -to-do households ha ve improved permanent houses with corrugated iron sheet for the roof. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 236 With respect to land tenure, participants felt the Lozi traditional land tenure system is good enough forevery one has access to the fllodplain. Asked if they see any constraints by not having a title deed to the land, the people responded by saying the issue of title deeds was not important to them. What was important to them was the provision of agricultural inputs at the right time and in correct amounts for the development of agricul ture in the area. They acknowledged that the population in the area was increasing and that young people seasonally migrate to the Zambia Sugar Company's Nakambala plantation in Mazabuka for cane cutting. The apparent lack of job opportunities in urban are as has provided incentives for many young people to remain in the villages . LUBITAMEI CANAL Scoping meeting held at Nalwela Village on 30th November 2013 In attendance: Charles Chewe from NIRAS Zambia, Maimbolwa Sitali NIRA Community Members presen t :confidential Mr. Charles Chewe started by introducing the purpose of the visit of the team from NIRAS Zambia in the village. Mr. Chewe encouraged participants to feel comfortable and discuss matters about the canal in question with free minds so that th e team from NIRAS Zambia can learn and write the sentiments of the local people from Lubatamei canal. The Induna Sisii who chaired the meeting was thankful to the team for having selected the Nalwela village for the study. The discussions started by agree ing that they had heard about the canals being rehabilitated from the radio when Honourable Alexander Chikwanda and the World Bank Resident representative in Zambia came to Mongu to sign and launch the project sometime this year. The community could not re call the exact month and date when this was. Through discussions, some recalled that the canal was rehabilitated sometime in 1968 from Nangula to Mombo. They also know that Lubatamei starts from Kate (the would be new district headquarters for the new Limu lunga District) up to Mbanikelako close to the Zambezi river. The community understood the history and that in the past it was being maintained by the local people themselves under the guidance of the Litunga and his council of elders the Indunas under the BRE. However, after independence in 1964, the new government started to manage and rehabilitated the canals and this gave the community the relieve to start working on the canals with cash bonuses from the government. Some people in the meeting noted that this was the beginning of the problem as people became lazy to work on the canals without being paid. This trend has continued and destroyed the local participation in canal clearing. In answering the question as to what they were using the Lubatamei cana l for, the answers were that the local people use the canal for fishing, drinking, poultry (local chickens and ducks) cattle rearing, bathing and washing clothes, transport and agriculture. The villages were reported to be heavily involved in gardening of vegetables along the Lubatamei. The community mentioned that the most important crops grown along the Lubatamei are rice (supa variety), sorghum (Kuyuma), Maize (MM608), Cassava (Nalumino and Kapumba). The community is also aware of the fact that Lubatamei is an important feature for draining their land. The community reported that there were no royal grave yards along the Lubatamei canal from Kate to Mbanikelako in Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 237 The community reckons and expects that during the rehabilitation, s ome form of temporal employment will be provided to the local people and people felt that there is no point of importing labour from outside Lubatamei canal during the rehabilitation. The community also noted that they will be willing to start the clearing the canals as long as the government helps us to deepen the canal as it has become very shallow with too much sand. The villages know the boundaries where they should be responsible for clearing, but this needs to be supported by the local Indunas and the entire BRE. The government also needs to do serious sensitization in order to get rid of the dependence syndrome that has been created by the government after independence. The community expected to have the crop production, have more fish in the canal. T he community expects that with the rehabilitation of the Lubatamei canal the community will have more incomes in their pockets with the increased agricultural production. The government should empower traditional authorities through headmen to oversee mana gement and maintenance after the proper dredging by the project. The canal is too wide to be maintained by hand with the deep sands inundated in it. On the issues of women, the entire women folk present noted that they are compelled to wake up between 04.0 0 and 05.00 am to start cleaning the surroundings to their homesteads after which they have to prepare for the journeys to the field around 06.00 hours for clearing the fields. Other duties they are engaged in are fetching water for the homestead before th ey set out to the fields. Their work load in a day goes for more than 12 hours at most. Women sleep around 20.00 and 21.00 hours in the Nalwela village and they thought similar situations are prevailing in the Barotse Flood Plain. One of the women highligh ted in her contribution the major problems women faced in Nalwela Village as follows: Female headed households are not able to afford the high fertilizer prices and do not belong to the Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP) as the collateral asked to join a club is K50 and thereafter one is expected to invest at least 50% for the cost of the input. The only prominent women group available is the Programme Against Malnutrition (PAM) group in the area. Lubatamei has crafts such baskets and clothing materials for chairs in houses but has no market for the same. Women do not have access to oxen as oxen under the Lozi culture and tradition are owned by the men. The lack of oxen reduces their productivity in terms of hectares they can work on every year. The well for water is very dirty and usually encounter diarrhea diseases and this is more dangerous to the young ones. There are no schools or clinics in vicinity. The nearest basic school is Limulunga (18 Kilometers), Clinic (Ikwichi, some 10 Kilometers away, wh ich takes 4 hours walk one way), Nangili Rural Health centre, 20 Kilometers, Ushaa Rural Health Centre, 10 Kilometers, Mwanawina Rura Health Centre, 15 Kilometers, Basic School (Machu, 8 Kilometers which takes 3 and half hours walk). The nearest school is the new community school that has just been built at Isambai (4 Kilometers away, takes about 1 hour walk one way). The women complained explained that this was the reason why many kids between the ages of 6 to 9 were present during the interviews in the v illage as they can not manage to go to school. In the village the community reported that they have tended to go to Ushaa for the clinic facilities. Women are involved in clearing the Lubatamei only for the portions of their field if they are cultivating rice. Some women reported that their hectarages for rice along the Lubatamei is maximum two Limas. On average, women have only 1 Lima of rice. On the youth, they noted that they love to stay in the Barotse Flood Plain as they have to do something for their survival but are constantly discouraged by the hardships they face such as poor toilet facilities due to the sand which makes the toilet collapse during the rainy season and end up using the bush and when it rains, the feaces get into the same Lubatamei an d we tend to drink contaminated water. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 238 The meeting felt that housing was another challenge the inhabitants of Lubatamei face. Most of the houses are made out of mud and pole. The other challenges were lack of employment opportunities in Barotse Flood Plain . Education opportunities for the young children is limited to grade 4 at Isambai Community School which is nearest to the village for our children. It was observed that population in the village was increasing in the village and reasons brought forward we re that there are no other employment opportunities to attract the young people to go to in the neighboring municipality of Mongu. Hence, people have no choice but to stay in the village and deal with the situation as they work on the soil and find food on the table for their families. Migration to cities was not noted as people are sure they will never get jobs even in the urban areas. They prefer to stay locally and continue dwelling with the production of crops for survival. Scoping meeting at Ndiki Bas ic School Canal, 28th January 2014. The local Silalo Induna, who had attended the previous PPCR meeting, held in Mongu in Janua ry 2013, mobilized eight villages for a scoping meeting at Ndiki Primary School. Forty -six (46) people attended the meeting. Also in attendance were Mr. Charles Kapekele Chileya, Mr. Mubiana Muliokela, and Mr. Shatontoka from NIRAs. After the opening praye r from one of the participants, Mr. Charles Kapekele Chileya went on to explain the purpose of their visit. He encouraged the participants to contribute freely as no one's opinions were less important. Many community members acknowledged hearing about the proposed canal rehabilitation project through local area Chief Lubinda Tanga, who had attended a meeting about the subject in Mongu. People reported that teachers had also been informing the local people about it through school pupils. Community member kne w how to clear the canal using shovels, picks, hoes, axes and sickles. The meeting revealed that local people took part in the periodic maintenance of the canal through the food-for-work programme and that it would be difficult for them to work without pay . This attitude and aparthy towards communal projects among the local people was confirmed by Mr. Mushele (Headteacher) and the Senior Teacher. The consultants observed that a community project to increase classroom space at the local primary school of Nd iki had stalled. The community stated that there were no burial or ritual sites along the canal, which could affect the proposed rehabilitation works. The Lubitamei canal is known by several names; Ndiki canal around area; and Lubitamei between Ushaa and the Zambezi River. Many people in attendance were aware that King Lewanika initiated the construction of canals in the Barotse Floodplain in order to drain the floodplain to reclaim land for agricultural purposes. People confessed that the king used compulsory labour to construct the canals and later kings employing the same approach to maintain them. However, since independence in 1964, people have been maintaining the canal as paid lablour force. Most people in th e area are involved in clearing the canal since time immemorial. They proposed that the government should employ them during the rehabilitation works and that they were not willing to maintain the canal without being paid. They described the working on the canals during the Lewanika's regin as having been slavery. Women also would also like to participate in the canal's rehabilitation to generate additional income. Alcoholism appears to be affecting agricultural production in Ndiki area as most men are h eavily engaged in the consumption of locally brewed wine. The method used in the preparation of the wine was described as unhygienic for the women brewers use dirty sisal sacks to filter the ingredients (mangoes and sugar). The wine's alcohol percentage is not known, but believed to be higher than that found in industrially brewed wine. Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Za mbezi 239 In addition to the hygienic condition of the beer brewing, the area also has problems with water for drinking. There is poor access to clean and safe drinking water except for the villages around Ndiki School. Consultants observed that the area lacks sources of safe water, lacks good housing and there are very few households with pitlatrines. It was revealed that dogs and pigs contributed to the contamination of the slow fl owing water in the canal. Community members pointed out the fact that poor water supply in the area is the cause of the annual outbreaks of waterborne diseases experienced during the rainy season, which not only puts a heavy economic burden on the already economically constrained communities. It was concluded that interventions that can address these factors be highlighted by the consultants. According to the Deputy Headmaster at Ndiki Basic School, the boy/child ratio stands at 7:4. This is a clear indicat ion that there are more boys going to school compared to girls. The meeting noted that this calls for interventions by creating awareness among parents of the need to give girls an equal opportunity to be educated. Local people are expecting that canal re habilitation will create employment opportunities and enable expansion of their gardens. They also anticipate that trade in poles for construction purposes will increase between the Barotse Floodplain and Ndiki and with surrounding forested upland areas. The main source of livelihood in Ndiki area is agriculture with rice, maize, cassava and vegetables as major crops. Rice is the major cash crop. Cassava is mainly cultivated for home consumption. A few households also rear cattle and local pigs. The majorit y of local inhabitants said they depended on the Lubitamei canal for their livelihood. Besides being the main source of domestic water supplies for many of the households in the area, people use the canal for bathing, watering cattle, soaking cassava and i rrigating vegetable gardens. According to the people, the canal was in the past used for transportation of construction poles to Lealui and Limulunga from the upland areas of Mweke and Simulumbe. Presently, because some portions of the canal are silted, na vigation by boats and canoes is not possible. The consultants observed that there was a local Disaster Management Committee in the area, which if strengthened and monitored properly, would ably spearhead canal maintenance in future. People revealed that after independence the government provided incentives for local people to get involved in the canal's maintenance. This not being sustainable, the meeting agreed that as the local people were the ones who benefited most from the canal, they should be respo nsible for its maintenance at their own cost. The meeting agreed that this was possible as long as the government works closely with the BRE and the local Disaster Management Unit in the area. The people of Ndiki area advocated for usage of machinery and e quipment in the proposed rehabilitation of the Lubitamei canal and then manual tools during maintenance works thereafter. Some people also proposed that the canal should be deepened in order to allow big canoes ferrying poles and other products from the u pland areas to navigate with ease. Consultants were imformed that the canal was last cleared in 2009 with the assistance of Concern Worldwide International who provided the necessary tools to the local Disaster Management Committee. Women in the area are mainly engaged in farming and beer brewing. There are no women associations to enhance their welfare. Some women revealed that some womenfolk belonged to grassroot structures of a political party, which structures only became active during election times. On the land tenure issue, the local people thought that it was not a constraint as any Lozi person had equal access to land and the Silalo Induna allocates land on behalf of the Litunga. Children are able to inherit their parents land once they become of age and their parents die. There is always a rule in the Lozi culture that the first -born child inherits the parent's estate regardless of sex. However, the meeting noted that there are instances of land squabbles especially on the Mazulu in the plain, bu t Silalo Indunas at the Kuta easily sort out these squabbles. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Bar otse sub -basin of the Zambezi 240 Fewer young men and women were leaving the area in search of employment in towns. Most of the youth present at the meeting talked of having gone to towns and had to come back after failing to find respectable employment. Given the foregoing, most youngmen found solace in staying and tilling the land and starting families in the village. The population was increasing in the area as evidenced by the number of children under five years . Scoping me eting at Nangula Village at Chief Lubindatanga's Palace along the Lubitamei Canal on 28th January 2014 In attendance were Charles Kapekele Chileya (Consultant from NIRAs Zambia, Mr. Mubiana Muliokela, Research Assistant from NIRAs Zambia) Mr. Charles Kapek ele Chileya introduced the purpose of the meeting and urged the participants to be open minded when discussing the issues as the canal rehabilitation was an important project that was bound to affect the community of Nangula. Through an interpretor, the ar ea chief informed the meeting that Nangula was the area first settled by the Lozi after carriving from Kola in present day Democractic Republic of Congo (DRC). It is reputed that Nangula School was built in 1914. People reported hearing about the canal re habilitation project on radio and from the area Induna who attended a workshop organized by the PPCR Secretariat from the Ministry of Finance in Mongu, at which workshop preliminary findings of the feasibility study were presented. According to residents, surveyors visited Nangula and erected beacons near the canal in full view of residents. They also revealed that the canal was dug during the reign of King Lewanika. The people cited fishing, irrigation, transportation, washing, drinking water for both ani mals and human beings as the main uses of the canal. There are no sites of culturl importance alog the canal which can affect rehabilitation works. Local burial sites are located far from the canal. However, people reealed the presence of a small lake called Lito lya ndiki in which it is belived a small animal known as Kapuwe lives. Local people believe that the water in the lake heals sick people if they drink it. The lake, is however not attached to the main canal. Local people expect that the rehabilita tion of the canal to create employment opportunities, open up land for rice production, improve navigation and thereby increasing the volume of trade in rice and other agricultural produce, improve the quality of water thereby reducing the incidence of wat erborne diseases through continuous flow. They also expect that this is the opportunity for footbridges to be constructed across the canals. They contend that the canal offers a shorter route to the Mongu and Limulunga markets than the Lusaka -Mongu road. The meeting deliberated on the best way of rehabilitating the canal. Most people would like the canal to be rehabilitated using machinery. Participants were of the view that villages along the canal should be empowered with tools necessary for maintainin g the canal after rehabilitation. During King Lewanika's reign people worked on the canals by force and after independence in 1964, the new government under Dr. Kenneth David Kaunda stopped the usage of compulsory labour and introduced the employment of lo cal people. As time went on the new government could not afford it and the canals remained unattended to. Some NGOs came into tnhe picture with following the food - for-work concept and people in the area have become used to the idea and would find it diffic ult to work for nothing. With respect to gender, the meeting established that women in the Nangula area wake up around 05:00 hours to start the day by going to the upland fields. They work in the fields until about 12:00 hours when they return home to fet ch water, collect firewood and prepare lunch. They go back to the fields around 15:00 hours to knock off around 18:00 hours. Once home they prepare for supper and attend to other family needs. They reportedly go to sleep around 21:00 hours. According to th e women, they have a heavy workload with little time to rest. p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 241 On the other hand, as cultivated fields are small men also help women to till the land and it is common for men and women to share the ploughing tasks. There are no development -oriented women cl ubs in the area except for church oriented ones. Women cited lack of capital, lack of agricultural implements, lack of hammer mills in the area, lack of markets for their fine grass, and long distance to the nearest Secondary School (Lukalanya, 50 Km away) . Many women and youth are involved in growing vegetables from which they generate an estimated ZMW 300 per month. Onions, chinese cabbage, rape, tomatoes and ordinary cabbage are the major vegetable types grown. On the other hand, some men in the area are engaged in drinking local wine, which makes them unproductive. The canal is the major source of livelihood for many people in the area and its rehabilitation is likely to impact positively on the community. For this reason, they are willing to participat e in the canal's maintenance. The houses and toilets in Nangula area are not different from those in the rest of the Barotse Floodplain; houses are made of reeds, mud and poles with grass -thatched roofs while the few pitlatrines are made of grass or reed s. Except for households around the school and health center, the rest of the population get their water from scoop holes dug near the banks of the Nangula canal. The water is not safe for drinking as the sources are prone to contamination. During the rai ny season, the area floods and all domestic and animal wastes are washed down into the canal increasing the risk of waterborne diseases. The water table in the area is reported to get low during the dry season and scoop holes dry forcing the affected house holds to make the long journey to the school or health center to access water. The population in the area was increasing. A few young men have tried to move out of the area to the nearby towns of Mongu and Kaoma in search of employment and most of them ha ve returned to the village after failing. Those that succeeded in getting jobs have stayed on. Population was on the increase in the area and key informants confirmed this. On land tenure, the participants pointed out the fact that they were aware the Litu nga holds the land on behalf of the people and that they cannot obtain title deeds but can have access to it and pass it over to their children. They do not perceive land tenure as a constraint to development but lack of investment capital. During deliber ations people pointed out that land in the Barotse Floodplain belongs to the people. They revealed that if anyone wanted land, one needed to go to the local chief through the local induna. \"When one is given, it is all yours until you die. The eldest child will inherit the land but share it with other siblings. Local Indunas chair land allocation committees thast consider requests for land within their boundary. The initial approval is then passed on to the Kuta, which makes the final decision. Land becomes yours when you are given. Scoping Meeting at Isambai Village along the Lubitamei Canal, 30th November 2013 The meeting opened with Mr. Charles Kapekele Chileya informing the people the purpose of the consultants' visit as being to engage with them on the proposed Canal Rehabilitation project in the Barotse Floodplain including the Lubitamei canal that passed through the area. He also informed the audience that the Ministry of Finance and National Planning would implement the project. The attendees report ed that they had heard about the project on local radio during the signing ceremony between the World Bank and the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ). The people also recited the little they knew about the the history of the first canal (that it wa s constructed by the famous King Lewanika during his reign and that he used compulsory labour. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmen tal and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 242 Local people used the Lubitamei canal for irrigating gardens, watering cattle, fishing, washing, transportation using canoes, bathing, soaking cassava and as a source of drinking water. It was revealed that there were no burial sites or places of cultural importance along the canal that may impede rehabilitation works. It turned out that every household in Isambai village is associated with the canal and that the people depended on it for their livelihood. The consultants were told that the residents of Isambai Village and the surrounding considered the canal as an economically viable natural asset, which needed to be properly maintained. Despite this understandin g, no one in the area was willing to get involved in the canal's maintenance without being paid. The canal has not been rehabilitated for close to 20 years and people expect that since some portions are blocked and would require machines to dredge these po ints as picks and shovels cannot do a good job. By so doing, the local people will find employment when the project starts on a daily and monthly basis. There is also the feeling that once the canal is rehabilitated flooding will stop or reduce and therefo re more land will be available for cultivation. They also expect that the water will be relatively clean as water flow will be continuos. Generally, the local people believe that the standards of living will improve with improvement in navigation and irrig ation opportunities. The people proposed that the usage of machines be considered during the rehabilitation of the Lubitamei canal as it needs some good depth and good width to sustain the transportation of poles and timber from the upland to the flood pla in for construction as it was in the past. Two canoes loaded with poles should be able to cross at any point of the canal. Human labour should be involved in the removal of dredged sand and other materials in the process. The people are of the opinion that the labour has to be paid for as no person in the village was willing to do any work on the canal free. People who have worked on the canals are paid in cash or in kind (food for work). The people were of the view that people needed sensitization on their responsibility of maintaining their portions of the canal and that the government should procure tools for maintenance works and left in the communities for easy access. It was also suggested that satellite Disaster Management and Mitigation Committees in collaboration with traditional leadership be given the responsibility of overseing canal maintenance. With respect to gender, women in Isambai area talked of waking up around 05:00 hours and starting their day by cleaning the homestead surroundings before setting off for their fields around 06:00 hours. They return homes around 13.00 hours to prepare lunch. After eating lunch and a brief rest they go back to the fields to return around 18:00 hours. Once home they fetch water, take a bath, wash children and prepare dinner. They go to bed between 21:00 and 22:00 hours. Women's workload was said to be heavy and demanding as there were no hammer mills to reduce on the labour spent on maize or cassava meal processing, Women complained of the high incidence of ma laria in the area, which reportedly affected productivity and agricultural production, lack of agricultural inputs, flooding of fields, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water. The people of in Isambai village largely depend on rain fed agriculture and fluctuations in the rainfall pattern leads to crop failure and subsequently food shortages. According to most people, canal rehabilitation will afford them the opportunity diversify to irrigated crop production and will contribute to poverty reduction . Houses are made of reeds and mud with grass -thatched roofs which do not last for a long periods. There are no pitlatrines in the area and people use the forest. This contributes to contamination of water during the rainy season when feacal material is wa shed into the Lubatamei canal by surface runoff. Population is increasing in the area and people would like the government to build them a school up to the Grade 9. The nearest school and health facility are at Ushaa, 9 kilometers away. There is a communit y school that provides education up to Grade Isambai. Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barot se sub -basin of the Zambezi 243 With respect to land tenure, the people living around Isambai pointed out that land in the Barotse Floodplain belongs to the Litunga who has entrusted the Silalo Indunas to allocate it to his sub jects within their village boundaries. Any one allocated land is assured of living on that particular land with his siblings untill death. The eldest child inherits the land, be they female or male. N'GOMBALA CANAL Scoping meeting held at Mwandi Village on 30th November 2013, Sefula Area along the Zambezi River Bank. In attendance were: Charles Chewe, NIRAS, Mr. Muliokela Mubiana (Research Assistant) Community Members present : confidential. Mr. Charles Chewe started to explain to the community the purpose and gist of the visit to N'gombala canal on the beautiful banks of the Zambezi River to the community around 09.00 hours. The group was guided by the village headman Akabondo Muchwala who in return welcomed the team. On the history of N'gombala , Mr. Akabon do explained that the canal was dug by a Japanese construction company called Taisei to facilitate transportation of building materials to Lukona in Kalabo district in the late 1980s. The Construction Company wanted to create a shorter route for their buil ding materials and it so happened that N'gombala was the shortest route to Kama. They even put a big barge at N'gombala village to transport the materials. After the Japanese left, the canal has never been used. The community w as aware of the new project c oming to clear the canal and promote development for the Lozi living in Barotse Flood Plain. They had heard this from various people who have been coming to N'gombala especially the Fisheries Department people and the agricultural camp officer at Sefula wo rking under the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. The community has never been involved in the clearing of the N'gombala canal except in 2010 when Fisheries Department came to deepen the confluence of the canal then did some young men and women get em ployed by the Fisheries Department. The community reported that the major sources of livelihood are cattle rearing, farming (rice especially and maize), fishing for both breams some kilometers away from the Zambezi during the flooding period), and basket f ishing by women in the shallow waters of the canal), beer brewing. The most important crops grown along the N'gombala canal were reported to be rice (with supa, blue bonnet, xiang Zhou as varieties), local maize, pumpkins and gourds. It was also reported t hat all the villages along the canal use it for bathing, washing clothes and watering cattle. Everybody present noted that the canal was an important commodity to them. During the rehabilitation, they expect the canal to be widened and enlarged to allow la rge boats and canoes. They expect this to shorten the distances the fish traders travel to buy fish. The community expects that village headmen and women will be heavily involved during the rehabilitation of the canals and especially after the canal has be en deepened and enlarged and all the sand deposit dredged away from the banks of the canal, it will be easier for the people from the villages to do the minor clearing. In addition, during the rehabilitation, the community expects that local labour will be locally sourced as opposed to importing it from outlying areas of Mongu and Namushakende. The community will be able to work for free once the canals have been rehabilitated by the project and with the guidance of the local authorities.They were of the vi ew that headmen should be in the forefront of canal maintenance. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 244 The women took the lead in answering their questions posed by Mr. Chewe. They reported that women along the N'gombala canal like in most parts of the Western province wake up every day around 05.00 and 06.00 hours. They commence their day by sweeping their homesteads and then set off for their rice or maizefields to work until about 12.00 hours when they return home to prepare lunch. Some women goback to the fields in the afternoon to continue with the morning work knocking off by 17:00 hours. After taking a bath and preparing dinner they reportedly go to bed around 20:00 hours. Overall, the women reported that the major constraints they face are lack of ox -ploughs, poor sources of clean water for drinking, poor sanitation (many households have no toilets). There are no women associations or clubs in the area. Women were involved during the canal clearing through the provision of labour for slashing around the canal during the time of the Japan ese construction company. According to the women, the N'gombala canal was used for transportation, bathing, washing clothes, farming and gardening, fishing with baskets at the shallow end of the canal. There is temporal migration of people into the Floodpl ain to buy and trade in fish. These people stay up to the time of the fish ban on the 1st of December every year. Otherwise, the meeting noted that there are no people leaving the floodplain in search of jobs in urban areas or new people coming to settle t here. The youth reported that there is no way they would move out of the plain as there are no prospects for jobs in the urban centers as their friends who migrated some time ago have not found jobs. It was discussed also that population in the plain was increasing as people in the area do not practice family planning and children are forced to marry early as the distances to schools from N'gombala is about 13 kilometers. Girls in the area tend to get married at very tender ages of as low as 15 years. The type of housing and toilets are not encouraging and the people use more of the bush than the grass thatched toilets and the situation is even worse during the rainy season. The community ended up by discussing the distances to the nearest social facilitie s such as clinics and schools. Mr. Akabondo ended up by thanking the survey team once more and the meeting ended at 16.30 hours. Scoping meeting at Sipolota and Taisei Fishing camps on the bank of the Zambezi River along the Ngombala Canal, 30thNovember 20 13. The meeting was held at Sipolota Village and was attended by Charles Chewe and Mubiana Muliokela from NIRAS Zambia Mr. Chewe opened the meeting by explaining the purpose of their visit and urging everyone to contribute and ask questions. Taisei villag e turned out to be a former building site and transit point for building materials the Japanese construction firm Taisei used during the construction of Lukona Secondary School and Rural Health Center. It is now a permanent village for migrant fishermen an d women fish traders. The community members in attendance were said to have migrated from different parts of the Western Province including Kalabo, Lukulu, Sesheke, Mongu, Sefula and Senanga Districts. Some of these people have even built permanent sctruct ures like groceries that provide services to the inhabitants and visiting traders. Parafin, cooking oil, sweets, pens, bathing soap, detergents and sugar are the common items stocked in the groceries. Some of the community members inforrmed the visiting co nsultatnts that they were aware that the Ngombala canal would be rehabilitated through a government project. However, the group was not aware about the canal's history besides the fact that a Japanese Contractor constructed it. The canal was mainly used fo r transportation of fish, agriculturar produce and commodities Other uses mentioned included irrigating vegetable and maize gardens, watering livestock (cattle and pigs), bathing and washing clothes and fishing during floods. The people in the area do not use the canal as a source of drinking water but rely on the Zambezi River. l and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 245 The people also revealed that the Ngombala canal was last maintained by hired labour that was paid for with cash or fish contributed by fishermen and fish traders living in Taisei and Sipolota fishing camps. The canal is blocked in some parts and is therefore not navigable throghuout its length. The people recommended that the canal be widened so that it could accommodate big canoes and large boats. Mr. Ngombala, a farmer with local knowledge about the canal was reputed to have been involved in the mobilization of people during the canal's occasional maintenance. There were suggestions that future maintenance activities involve village headmen under the supervision of the traditional leadership. The women living here wake up around 06.00 hours and set off for their rice fields. Women fish traders also wake up also this time and go to the river to wait for fishermen returning from nighttime fishing expeditions. The women who are involv ed in rice cultivation reported returning from the fields about 12.00 hours to start preparations for mid -day meal. They usually have lunch around 14.00 hours. About 15.00 hours the women farmers go back to the fields to knock off around 18.00 hours to com plete household chores and cook supper. Most of the women reported going to sleep around 21.00 hours. The women mentioned that the workload on women is heavy but that they are able to cope. The Zambezi River, less than a kilometer from the settlements, is the major source of domestic water. The area has no women associations or clubs that can promote the interests of women. The consultants observed that firewood was a major challenge for households along the Ngombala canal as they depend on old mango trees that have reached pick production or purchased small cords of firewood imported from the uplands. People identified the following as challenges they faced: long distances to heath facilities and schools (Namushakende and Sefula at 15 and 13 Kilometers, re spectively); poor sources of drinking water (Zambezi River and scoop holes); high incidence of malaria, bilharzia, trachoma and diarrhea; and long distance to markets (fish traders). Women also reported that scoop holes accumulate worms after three -four mo nths forcing them to dig new ones. Health personnel at Sefula Rural Health Center confirmed the disease prevalence mentioned by the community. A few youth and men have migrated into the urban areas in search of gainful employment but the common trend is t emporary migration during the period between December and April every year, coinciding with the annual fish ban. The youth reavealed that fishing was a very profitable enterprise that generated daily income and relish for the family and not easy to abandon . Participants posed a question as to when the actual rehabilition works would start. Mr. Chewe confessed that the question was a difficulty one to give a straight answer to explaining that the project was in its feasibility study phase involving technica l field measurements and assessment of impacts on the environment and communities but as was required for development projects of this nature. He assured the people that actual implementation would start after appraisal of the feasibility study phase and i dentification of a contractor. He reiterated that the government and World Bank were committed through the signing ceremony and engagement of BRL and NIRAS Zambia to undertake the fesibility studies. Scoping meeting for farmers along Village 2013 The meeting was held at Sefula Farmer's Training Centre located on the edge of the floodplain. Most of the participants were former beneficiaries of the JICA proje ct that promoted irrigated rice production. Tthe purpose of this scoping meeting was to try to find out why the project failed. In attendance were Charles Kapekele Chileya, Christoph Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priori ty traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 246 The ten farmers were from villages that were involved in the defunct rice irrigation project. The farmers continue to grow rice without external assisstance. Asked about the proposed canal rehabilitation project in the area, they answered that they were fully aware and looked forward to its successiful implementation. After explaining about the proposed canal rehabilitation project, Mr. Chileya asked the participants what went wrong with the rice project at Sefula. The answers were vast.. One of the answers was that the Japanes e did not understand the social fabric dynamics of the Lozi people and assumed that you would maintain the irrigation project without the full involvement of the BRE in the area. The BRE plays a very significant role in the development of the Western provi nce. One has to understand how the BRE functions and one ought to involve them from the scratch. From his view point the BRE should have been asked to take the lead in the mobilization of the locals for example in the management of the sand bank that was bult upstream. The second point mentioned was that the main Sefula canal was being blocked near its source in Malile. The movement of sand also affected the Sefula Irrigation project in the sense that there is water logging in the Sefula area. The outlet bu ilt from the main canal was silted and much of the area is poorly drained. There were no provisions to clear parts of the canal in Nomai area, source of the Sefula canal. Nomai is an important place that the Paris Missionary Society (PMS) established to ge t the water source protected and built a small Mission settlement to ensure that there were people living around the source of the canal to monitor the flooding levels and movement of the water in the canal. The meeting also heard that the infrastructure w as not as solid as it should have been resulting in the collapse of the secondary canal. The canal's collapse was also a resilt of lack of maintenance. In addition, the lateral canals were supposed to be dredged from time to time, but this was never done a fter the project team left. On top of the factors alluded to above the farmers noted that they did not have access to tillage equipment after the project wound up. It was reported that land disputes emerged and scheme members started to default on paying w ater user fees. This was because the people did not consider the scheme as theirs. They perceived the project as a JICA project. Currently, the scheme register has 300 farmers but less than 10% pay water user fees to the Association for canal maintenance. The other problem observed with the scheme is that there was too much emphasis on rice farmers with little consideration for other stakeholders like livestock farners, maize farmers and fishermen. These canal users should have been taken on board during th e design and implementation stages. They do have an impact on the irrigation scheme as well indirectly and directly. Fishermen and livestock farmers were known to damage the canals as they fished and watered their animals. There are by laws that guide the operations of the scheme but they exclude fishermen and livestock farners. It was was assumed that only rice farmers were stakeholder and others not relevant to the goals. Siltation along the canal from Nomai area of up to the Scheme area must be sorted o ut and of course the sand bank located in the villages behing Sefula shopping area should be cleared and opened up to allow the ease flow of water into the scheme. The state in which the sand trap needs to be dredged. After dredging the sand bank, the loc al people and the farmer assosciation with the new impetus it would acquire by having an extended membership list of various stakeholders can then be charged and be made responsible for the clearing of the same. Of course with the full involvement of the B RE. Upstream cleaning and clearing of the Sefula Canal is crucial and most important. Rice requires fine tillage and good soils. The soils in the scheme are acidic and liming should become an integral part of production practices if better yields are to b e realised. There is no tillage equipment in the irrigation scheme. Lime is not easy to source locally and this compounds the problem for scheme farmers as it not part of the usual package under the Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP). Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 247 FISHERIES CANAL Scoping meeting held at Situnda Village on the plain edge of the Fisheries canal. In attendance were Charles Chileya (NIRAS of Zambia, Muliokela Mubiana, Research Assistant and Interpreter). Village members of Situnda Village present were: confidential. Mr. Chileya commenced by introducing the subject matter at hand to the local people who were very keen to hear of the message and the purpose of the visit. In his opening remarks, Mr. Chileya encouraged all the present members of the village to speak their m inds out and represent the views of the people who were not present during the meeting for one reason or the other. He also encouraged them to go back and take the message to same group of people. Mr. Friday Walubita thanked Mr. Chileya and his group for p aying them an impromptu visit which they never expected but will be willing to contribute to the meeting as the canal issues in Namushakende has been a key issue people want sorted out by the new government. From the discussions, the members reported that they have heard about the project from the Fisheries Extension Assistant located at Namushakende and other people from the political ward. They also recall that the canal was first constructed by the Fisheries Department in 1972 but only completed the cana l around 1973. The objective for dredging the fisheries canal was to ensure that there was safe fish breeding in the Zambezi area during floods and also ensure that drainage for the farming enterprise was going to be a complimentary issue to agriculture. The community also noted that during the dredging of the fisheries canal, many local people were employed and this acted as an incentive to them. The Fisheries Department dredged the canal but it was too wide. The community was aware of the uses of the cana l which they summarized as follows: 1. Transportation of people, 2. Farming, 3. Draining of the Barotse Floodplain 4. Fishing, 5.Washing and bathing and 6.Transportation of charcoal and fire wood. They also acknowledged the importance of the fisheries cana l to the entire populace living along the canal. The people in the village expect that during the dredging, local people will be provided with employment and business will improve given the fact that the community will have a harbor also completed and this will provide a readily available permanent market structure for the villages living along the start of the canal in the Namushakende plain edge of the Barotse Flood Plain. They also expect that they will be involved in clearing the canal using the village headmen as coordinators in the mobilizing the communities with the support of the BRE Indunas of the areas along the fisheries canal. Indunas can form committees to clear portions of the canal for each village. Currently, the Indunas are levying fishermen and fish traders side by side with the Mongu district council at the markets and the system is working pretty well. The community encouraged us to work closely with the BRE on the canal matters. The issue of women came up and women took the floor and answ ered questions. The women noted that they woke up every morning around 5.00 hours. After waking up, they clean their surroundings and homes before going out into the fields for cultivation. They return back to the villages around 13.00 hours pm to prepare lunches for their homes and then rest a bit and set off for the afternoon sessions around 15.00 hours. The women noted that the Indian Mark 2 pump is within the vicinity of the village within a radius of 500 meters for all households. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 248 There is a Women Savi ngs and Credit Association in Namushakende and most of the village women are members. The Savings and Credit Association is supported by the government through the Ministry of Community Development Mother and Child. There is a bore hole in the village sunk sometime by Village Water in 2006. The major problem women face in this village was the poor toilet and poor housing otherwise the school and the clinic were just a stone throw away. \"One would wish to have a programme which can provide us with cement an d we build permanent toilets for ourselves on self -help basis\" one woman lamented. Others joined and said this was one of the major challenges the area is facing as we have more diarrhea cases during the rains as most of the households use the bush for the toilet. The distance to the school and the clinic is just 1 kilometer away. The area they noted and appreciated was too close to main Senanga -Mongu Road and transport was not a problem for them to take their produce to the urban markets of either Senanga or Mongu. There is a fully fledged Secondary School at Namushakende and it is now expected that King Lewanika University will soon be built by the government to compliment the newly established University of Barotseland, a private institution. In the villa ge, there are no major constraints for women except they would like to have access to loans for ox ploughs and implements. Scoping meeting held at Nakatoya Village (Central place) and included seven other villages of Namuku, Loyana, Nasinandi, Nyambe, Lil ami, Kashumba and Nashikundu on the plain edge of the Fisheries canal, 1st February 2014 The local agricultural camp officer resident at Namushakende Agricultural Camp mobilized the people and arranged the meeting for the morning of Saturday, 1st February 2014. People from eight villages assembled Nakatoya village located near the Fisheries canal. The village is host to the planned mini -harbour and Fish Market. In attendance were Charles Kapekele Mubiana and Mr. Sitali from Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL). The Village Headman opened the meeting by welcoming the visitors from NIRAs and BRL of France and asking for an opening prayer from a volunteer within the group. After the prayer, t he Headman asked the team leader to introduce the subject matter. Mr. Chileya took the floor and explained that the purpose of their visit to the area was to engage the people on the proposed canal rehabilitation project in the Barotse Floodplain under the PPCR of the Ministry of Finance and National Planning. He stressed the importance of everyone present to contribute freely on any issues deemed relevant to the rehabilation and local people's expectations. Mr. Christoph Navitel added that BRL and NIRAS ha d now been working in the project area collecting technical information for some time but that it was also necessary to collect their views and other socio -economic information for inputing into the final report. Community members acknowledged that they ha d heard about the proposed project and seen Surveyors putting beacons at intervals along the Musyamo and Fisheries canals. The consultants were informed that the local radio station had spread news of this development during and after the signing ceremony between the Minister of Finance and the World Bank's Country Representative in Zambia. The community was aware of the history of the two canals, Musyamo and Fisheries. They pointed out that Fisheries Department constructed the latter with the objectives o f enhancing transportation of fish catches to the markets and providing breeding ground for fish during floods. They further revealed that the Musyamo canal was constructed during the reign of King Lewanika in the 1800s. The community reported that there are other canals that were built in the Namushakende area and these are, Mbumbi, Muku, Nasikundu and Sefula canals. Maintenance of canals was a responsibility of the local people before independence but that after independence, the government took over th e maintenance and employed paid labour, destroying the self -help spirit that existed in the past. According to the community, the government in 1992 and 2006, respectively last maintained the Musyamo and Fisheries canals / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 249 Local people use the Fisheries can al for transportation, fishing, as a source of drinking water, for bathing and washing clothes, soaking cassava, watering cattle and small livestock (pigs and goats). The Fisheries canal has no sites of cultural importance or burial sites along its course that could affect rehabilitation works. They proposed that Musyamo canal be rehabilitated using manual labour except for the portions that needed machinery. The local people knew the portions of the canal that are bad. The main sources of livelihood in the area are fish trading, chicken trading. Beer brewing, charcoal burning and harvesting poles. Some participants in the meeting were of the view that the Fisheries canal should be dredged with machinery that can throw the silt and sand far from the banks as the current practice of heaping grudged material on the banks is ineffective as the the material is washed back by floods. They also contended that because the canal is deep it cannot be effectively cleared using manual labour. On the other hand, some peo ple living in Nakatoya Village along the Musyamo canal are of the opinion that it be cleared by manual labour provided appropriate tools are provided by the project. The community is of the opinion that local inhabitants should be responsible for future m aintenance of canals under the supervision of the BRE. The people expressed willingness to take responsibility after the government has carried out major rehabilitation works. Nearly all the residents of Nakatoya Village depended on the Fisheries canal fo r survival. They are expecting the rehabilitation of the canal will create job opportunities for many of the unemployed youth. People also anticipate that smooth flow of water in the rehabilitated canal will result in more drained land for cultivation. Peo ple pointed out that the BRE and the Disaster Management Committees in the area should be involved from the start of the works. Women in the 8 villages reported that they woke up between 04.00 and 05.00 hours and went to their upland fields returning home between 13:00 and 14:00 hours for lunch preparation and brief rest. They again leave home for Saana fields around 15:00 hours returning around 18:00 hours only to start preparing for supper which is eaten around 19.00 hours. The majority of them go to slee p around 21:00 hours. Women also reported that besides a heavy workload and long working hours, they also faced a variety of challenges. The most important of which are lack of implements for tilling the land, black beetle attacks in their rice fields, ex cessive flooding in some years, long distance to safe water source (fetch water (2 Kilometers from the water sources), No fertilizer available (up to 2 Km), poor sanitation, poor state of the road linking Namushakende and the Fisheries canal. The consultan ts observed that the majority of households had no toilets or pitlatrines and were using matema fields for defacating. Because of this, the water in the Musyamo and Fisheries canals is not safe for drinking. The people claimed that they do not dig pitaltr ines because they easily collapse due to the sandy nature of the soil. Although they were aware that they could prolong the lifespan of pitlatrines by reinforcing the hole with burnt bricks and cement, they claimed it was costly to source cement. Due to po or access to clean water, proper sanitation facilities and inadequate hygiene, the communities of the 8 villages constantly experience outbreaks of waterborne diseases especially among children under the age of five. Typically, this is yet another woman's burden as it is generally the responsibility of women to attend to medical needs of sick children. People also reported that there is a high incidence of diseases in the area and this adversely iaffected agricultura productivity. 12. Appendices Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 250 On land tenure, the people described the land tenure system as being customary and to make matters worse for the 8 villages much of the land in the 8 villages belonged to an absentee princess (Mukwae). The land was allocated to her by the father before his death, and according to c ustom will continue to own it until death. Although a property owner, she does not get any land rentals but controls its allocation by local Indunas. On population trends, elders reported that there was a general increase in the population of the area as evidenced by the higher proportion of young children. Most of the youth were not moving out to urban areas because others had tried only to come back after failing to find jobs . Scoping meeting held at Namutondo Village on 28th November, 2013 around Namush akende but now in Nalolo District In attendance were Charles Chewe and Mubiana Muliokela from NIRAS Zambia. Mr. Chewe introduced the subject and invited the participants to the meeting to be as open as they could be when discussing the matter of canal reh abilitation as it concerned them and their livelihoods. He asked them to be objective in their contributions and accept other people's opinions. He further explained the purpose of their visit as being to generate information on the views and expectations of the local people on the proposed rehabilitation project covering the Fisheries, Ngombala, Musyamo, Muoyowamo and Lubitamei canals under the PPCR project to be implemented by the Ministry of Finance and National Planning with financial assistance from th e World Bank. From the onset of the discussions, the local people reported to have heard about the project on radio and from the local Agricultural Extension worker at Namushakende as well as Fisheries Officers from Mongu. All the participants knew the hi storical background of the Fisheries canal; that construction works began in 1973 with the the purposes of connecting the plain edge and the Zambezi River and to provide breeding ground for fish. The canal is used for irrigation of vegetable gardens and ri ce fields, too. The Fisheries Department maintains the canal through locally employed people. The maor sources of livelihood of people living along the Fisheries canal are agriculture with rice, maize, sweetpotatoes, pumpkins and cowpeas as main crops; an d trading. The Fisheries canal's harbour near Nakatoya Village is now a busy market for fresh and dry fish with people from Namushakende and surrounding areas coming to buy the commodities during the fishing season. The Mongu Manucipal Council generates r evenue through fish and marlet levies. The people of Namutondo village attach great importance to the Fisheries and Musyamo canals as they contribute significantly to household and local economies. With the proposed rehabilitation of the Fisheries canal, l ocal people are expecting employment opportunities, increased business activities, establishment of a full -fledged harbour and market, increment in yields of crops grown in sitapa fields and reclamation of presently water logged adjacent lands. The local p eople pointed out that the Fisheries canal is too deep and requires machines to rehabilitate it properly and that they are not willing to provide labour at no cost for future maintenance activities. The meeting analysed the long list of constraints faced b y the local people and identified the major ones as being excess flooding of rice due to poor water control, drought in the recent past has affected crop production, rice pests which include mice and fish, and of course low incomes. They proposed assistanc e to access agricultural implements especially for women, entrepreneurship skills training and construction of an all -weather road from Senanga/Mongu road to the Fisheries canal harbour. There is a Savings and Credit Scheme group in the area to which a few women were members. p:\\brli\\dressayre \\800568_zambie baro tse\\5_production \\2_esia \\esia\\final\\esia-barotse -final-zemaformat.docx / Eric Deneut Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 251 On population trends, the participants reported an increase, which they attributed to low levels of family planning among the youth and early marriages among girls. A few of the youth were moving to urban centers in search of jobs but the majority has stayed behind. There has been no significant migration of people from the area as some are able to get employment locally in government departments and as domestic workers for people working in government institutions such as agriculture, health, community development, police and schools. People in the village sourced water from a protected well with the furthest household from the well being just 100 meters. The nearest school and health centre are at Namushakende about 1 Km away. Although the health center was within easy reach, it had inadequate trained maternity personnel and maternity facilities. There were claims that untrained members of staff often attended to patients. The daily calendar for women showed that they woke up at about 05:00 hours to go to the fields returning home around 13:.00 hours to prepare lunch for the family. They go back to the field at about 15.00 hours for the second round of agricultural work finally knocking off about 18.00 hours. On reaching home they have to fetch water, clean the homestead, take a bath and prepare supper which is normally eaten between 19:00 and 20:00 hours. The women reported that they usually retired to bed between 21.00 and 22:00 hours. The meeting ended at 17:00 hours after a prayer f rom one of the women participants and a statement thanking the people from the consultants . 12.

BACKGROUND A. The Barotse Floodplain The Barotse sub-basin (population 1.1 million in 2010) is one of Zambia's most vulnerable areas. It comprises the Barotse Floodplain, Zambia's second largest wetland1, a designated Ramsar site, and proposed as a World Heritage Site. The Barotse floodplain in the Zambezi is at the center of the livelihoods and culture of the Lozi people, who depend on the floodwaters for irrigation, fisheries, wildlife, and cultural ev ents. It is the site of the world -renowned Kuomboko ceremony, marking the migration of the Lozi king (the Litunga) and his people to higher lands at the end of the rainy season. The annual floods start around December and reach their peak 3 -5 months later , flooding an area of over 1 million ha. The width of the floodplain averages 30 km, but reaches 50 km north of Mongu. It extends from the Zambezi's confluence with the Kabombo and Lungwebungu Rivers (in the north) to south of Senanga, above the Ngonye f alls (circa 230 km south). The canals in the Barotse sub -basin have over the years been maintained through community -based approaches, and/or through force account, where the Provincial Maritime Department contracts out community -based works through cash-for-works or (with lesser success) food -for-works schemes. For works requiring dredging or excavation, the Maritime Department has relied on machinery based in Mongu, and implemented its own works, funded through an annual budget for canal maintenanc e. In all cases, the works are defined by the Government, with BRE and community participation, and community members are paid on the basis of unit prices for different work items, i.e. a contract based on \"input\" to the works. While the arrangements are socially acceptable, the results to date have been less than optimal. The problem is that the workers (or contractors) tend to have the wrong incentive, i.e. to carry out the maximum amount of works to maximize their profits, while at the same time they do not feel accountable for maintenance of service levels. (a) Figure 1 Satellite Map of the Barotse Floodplain 1 The main flood plain is 5,500 km2 but it extends to 10,750 km2 if the floodplains of tributaries (such as the Luena Flats) are considered. The landscape is generally flat, from 914 to 1,218 m. Sources: UNESCO, and Wilkipedia, 8. Bibliographical sources g:\\brl\\esia\\scoping \\scopingesia -barotse.docx / Eric Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 140 (b) The soil is mostly nutrient -poor Kalahari Aeolian sands, waterlogged during the flood period and dry most of the year. At the same time, the Barotse floodplain supports a rich and diverse ecological and human landscape, characterized by a network of canals, mounds, traditional houses, cultural shrines, swamp and evergreen forests, and a variety of natural landmarks. (c) The Lozi people have learned to live with floods for centuries, relying on a complex system of canals for navigation, drainage, cultural ceremonies, fisheries, and irrigation. The canals are mounds are vital to their socio -economic livelihood. Through centuri es of adaptation, they developed an intricate system of land and natural resource management under the overall patronage of their King (the Litunga) and the Barotse Royal Establishment. This sub -basin accounts for a considerable and predominantly rural agrarian population exposed to harsh impacts of extreme climate change. This results in high pressure on arable land, and widespread degradation to the natural environment and natural resources which in turn aggravates exposure to climate extremes. It howe ver remains an area of very significant biodiversity, while remaining a vital source of drinking water, power, irrigation, and natural resources for its people. Almost all of Barotse falls within the immediate catchment of the Zambezi River. People livin g on the floodplain have developed intricate systems of adaptation, particularly through the development of the canals (many built during the 19th century) and mounds, used for settlements, farming, and burial sites. Soil is brought from the plains and pi led on the mounds. Settlements are typically small and semi -permanent. Some of the mounds are used for temporary shelter or fishing camps, and some have been abandoned and are used for burials or animal shelters. Traditionally, people living in the fl oodplain moved between two houses (one on the plain, one on higher land), but this tradition has been progressively weakened due to increasing urban -rural migration and changes in livelihood patterns. Economic opportunities are particularly limiting for t he youth, who are typically allocated land further from irrigation canals, as well as for vulnerable elderly taking care of children and orphans. Traditional systems of canal and natural resources management are also under threat due to increased monetiza tion, external pressures (particularly on forestry and fishing resources), increasing concentration of cattle ownership, and incongruencies between forms of traditional management and central government authority. Vegetation clearing in eastern Angola highlands as well as in the watersheds surrounding the Barotse basin is further changing hydrology and flood patterns. The above trends have made it progressively more difficult for BRE authorities to organize communities to voluntarily clear the canals, and has led to expanded private water use behaviour, over communal or group agreements on water uses. The Harbor Maste r, who Source: NASA 8. Bibliographical sources g:\\brl\\esia\\scoping \\scopingesia -barotse.docx / Eric Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 141 responds to the Ministry of Communications, Transport and Public Works, has developed systems of food -for-works and cash -for-works (at about ZMK 5,000,000 per km) for the cleaning of the canals, but routine maintenance is affected by the lack of a s teady and reliable operation and maintenance (O&M) budget. Water user associations are virtually unknown, although traditional systems of management (under BRE) remain strong. Climate change is adding increasing pressure to these already complex anthrop ogenic trends. Once heavily reliant on traditional early warning signs, Lozi farmers are now increasingly exposed to unpredictable floods, and periods of drought and intense rainfall. The traditional canals built in the late 1880s have become silted and un-navigable, affecting agriculture and fisheries production and water logging is increasingly affecting shallow wells and food crop production. Addressing these challenges effectively will require in -depth studies and participatory development planning endorsed by both traditional (BRE) and Government authorities, as well as local communities. In particular, attention has to be paid to water uses that promote livelihood diversification for the most vulnerable - women, elderly, and the youth - in ways th at respect and sustain the delicate environment of Barotse and the Lozi's socio - cultural traditions, and is fully compatible with the submission of the Barotse floodplain as a World Heritage Site. Rehabilitation and management of the canals should aim to restore the canals as much as possible to their original state and socio -economic uses, and maximize the use of local labor (particularly targeting the most vulnerable households) while at the same time enhancing the canals' use in controlling the effects of climate change - particularly in managing floods, droughts and the effects of increased temperatures. It is also critically important that any rehabilitation and improved management of the canals not affect in any significant way the flood patterns for downstream riparians located along the Zambezi (particularly Namibia and Mozambique). To this end, the study should assess carefully not only the likely future socio -economic and physical impacts of the rehabilitated canals, but also the potential impacts of resulting changes in landuse (e.g. increased farming) on the hydrology and geomorphology of the floodplain. As many of the target canals are deeply silted, solid community organization and agreement amongst water users - particularly on responsibiliti es and arrangements for O&M - will be essential prior to the start of the works. Hence, the design of the component should take into account an initial solid period of institution -building, with clear criteria for proceeding to investment. Fortunately, th e PPCR counts with the support of BRE and the local authorities, as well as several complementary partners such as the National Heritage Conservation Commission, the Red Cross, Concern Worldwide, the Provincial and District DMMU committees and provincial H arbor Master, Water and Agriculture agencies. They know the sub -basin well, and their support and active involvement in the consultations led by the study would be of high importance. The rehabilitation and strengthened management of canals will be accom panied closely by a separate, Participatory Adaptation component, which will fund a range of adaptation activities proposed by Local Area Development Committees and the 8 pilot districts of the 8. Bibliographical sources g:\\brl\\esia\\scoping \\scopingesia -barotse.docx / Eric Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin though the design of this Participatory Adaptation component is not part of this study, the consultant should keep it closely in mind for complementarity. B. Target Canals There are 5 target canals that have been prioritized by BRE and regional authorities and should be assessed by the study. Their approximate location is shown on the map below, and their approximate characteristics are as follows: 1. Muoyowamo Canal (28 km) - This canal was built between 1887 and 1889. Used in the annual Kuomboka ceremony, it is a culturally critical canal for the Lozi people. It is also used for agriculture, transport, drainage. This is a relatively large canal that would likely require mechanized dredging. 2. Lubitamei Canal (87 km) - import ant for agriculture, fisheries, transport, and drainage. This is a relatively narrow canal, which is normally handled through community -based O&M, although it may require some mechanization in particularly clogged areas. 3. Ng'ombala Canal (43.7 km) - an imp ortant canal for transportation linking the east and west banks to Kama. Likely to also require mechanized dredging. 4. Musiamo Canal (131 km) runs along the banks of the flood plain and is the longest - a critically important canal for agriculture, fisherie s and drainage. Like Lubitamei, it is mostly maintained through community -based labor. 5. Fisheries Canal (9 km) - as per canals 1 and 3, likely to require mechanized dredging. The initial design had also included the Mongu -Kalabo canal. Nonetheless, thi s canal is likely to be affected by the ongoing construction of the Mongu -Kalabo road, a large -scale 8.

It should be noted that due to their relatively small size (about 3 meters in diameter), earthlining, and degree of erosion, the precise location of the canals is not always clear from a quick side inspection or using Google Maps, particularly during the d ry season. It will be important for the study to map out both their existing path, as well as any adjustments proposed to improve their role in climate resilience. C. The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience The Pilot Program of Climate Resilience (PPCR) aims to incorporate adaptation to climate change into the most vulnerable sectors of the economy. In June 2011, Zambia submitted its proposal to a donors committee in Cape Town, and was pledged up to US$40 -50 million in grant resources, and up to US$38 mi llion in highly concessionary credit. The PPCR is an inherent part of Zambia's emerging National Climate Change Program. It aims to support three projects: 1. Strengthening Climate Resilience in Zambia and the Barotse sub - basin (administered through the World Bank). This project (ca. US$34 million) will include three components: Strategic program support to Zambia's emerging Climate Change Programme (at the national level), including institutional strengthening, policy mainstreaming, improved climate information, and management of external resources. Climate -Resilient Infrastructure - Improved management of priority canals in Western Province - the subject of the current study. Participatory Adaptation in 8 districts of the Barotse sub -basin (7 in West ern Province, 1 in Southern Province). This will help supplement the Constituency Funds to help districts and Local Area Committees develop local plans that incorporate climate resilience. 2. Strengthening Climate Resilience in the Kafue Sub -Basin (administe red through the African Development Bank). This project (ca. US$37 million) will include two components: Climate -Resilient Infrastructure - Rehabilitation of access roads linking Victoria Falls to Kafue National Park to flood -resistant standards Participat ory Adaptation in 16 districts of the Kafue sub -basin. 3. Private Sector Support to Climate Resilience (administered through the International Finance Corporation), approximately US$15 million. These three projects are starting preparation now, and are expected to become active in 2013, for a period of 6 years (2013 -2019). Their preparation is being funded through a Project Preparation Grant, which is also funding the present study. This study covers the detailed design and socio -environmental safeguards of the Climate -Resilient Infrastructure Component for Project #1, above. At present, the Ministry of Finance is also executing a Technical Assistance Grant (Phase I of PPCR) for US$1.5 mil lion, primarily to promote institutional coordination and economic mainstreaming. However, the PPCR is an inter -sectoral program, and counts with the support of several platforms managed by an eminent expert on their sector. As the 8. Bibliographical sources g:\\brl\\esia\\scoping \\scopingesia -barotse.docx / Eric Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 144 Climate Resilient Infr astructure platform is headed by an expert from the Roads Development Agency (RDA), the Ministry of Finance has asked RDA to assist them with the procurement of the studies and Environmental and Social Impact Assessments for, respectively, the canals in Ba rotse, and the access roads in Kafue. These two studies - and their associated ESIA - are being procured separately. In addition, the Project Preparation Grant is funding the following preparatory studies: 1. A Strategic Environmental and Social Assessm ent (SESA), Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF), and Resettlement Policy Framework for the entire program. 2. A baseline study for the two pilot sub -basins 3. The design of the Participatory Adaptation Component 4. Preparation of the f inal project documents, including Operational Manuals. Whilst the SESA and ESMF will cover the entire project, the Climate -Resilient Infrastructure component is sufficiently sensitive to be rated Environmental Category A under World Bank safeguard policie s. Hence, a full fledged and careful Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) is needed as part of this study. Preparation of the PPCR projects will be coordinated by the Ministry of Finance and National Economic Planning (MoFNP), Economic Manage ment Department, in close collaboration with the inter -sectoral platforms mentioned above. Key stakeholders for this study will include, in addition to MoFNP: The Roads Development Agency (RDA) which is managing the study's procurement The Maritime Depar tment at the national and provincial (Harbor Master) levels - the Government agency in charge of canals The National Heritage Conservation Commission - responsible for the submission of Barotse as a World Heritage Site The Zambian Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) - responsible for the Ramsar management The Provincial Government of Western Province, through the Provincial Development Planning Committee and the Disaster Management and Mitigation Committee The Barotse Royal Establishment - responsible for all traditional management in Barotse The Zambian Civil Society Network - responsible for community sensitization The Zambian Red Cross - a partner with ZCSN on community sensitization Further details on the PPCR can be found on Zambia's submission to the PP CR Sub - Committee in June 2011 at the link below: 8.

OBJECTIVES AND TASKS EXPECTED FROM THE ASSIGNMENT A. Objective The objective of the assignment is to assess how use of the targeted canals in the Barotse sub -basin can be strengthened to optimize their role in supporting the local population to become more climate resilient, taking into account the prevailing socio - cultural and environmental context. The ultimate goal of the investment is to strengthen canal management and rehabilitation in order to facilitate a transformative process in the Barotse, where communities would become better adapted to climate extremes (higher temperatures, and increasing floods and droughts). Building upon the strength of traditional systems, the study should also propose ways whereby traditional management could be optimized to take into account present -day realities and socio -economic pressures. It is envisaged that the Consultant will design the Canal component (estimated total cost US$11 million) with two major sub -components: (d) Strengthened Management of Traditional Canals (estimated cost US$2.5 million), providing the necessary policy, technical and institutional s upport to canal management, including: (i) piloting innovative ways to ensure sustainability - such as introduction of performance based contracts and dedicated operation and maintenance (O&M) funds; (ii) facilitating agreement between traditional water u sers; and (iii) better organization of communities in O&M. (e) Canal Rehabilitation (estimated cost US$8.5 million), including embankment stabilization (with earthworks and vegetative approaches), selected dredging, and erosion -control measures, with a view to restore the canals as much as possible to their traditional design, while optimizing their use in climate resilience. With the exception of specialized interventions (such as dredging), the works are expected to maximize the use of local labor, and bene fit the most vulnerable. Rehabilitation of the canals should only proceed once pre -defined community organization criteria under sub -component (a) were achieved, thus ensuring sustainable O&M. The estimated costs could be refined and if necessary adjuste d during the study. B. Principles to be followed The Consultant should design the interventions with the following principles in mind: 1. Strict observance and collaboration with traditional management structures, 8. Bibliographical sources g:\\brl\\esia\\scoping \\scopingesia -barotse.docx / Eric Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 146 2. Respect and conformity with the floodplain's status as a Ramsar site and proposed World Heritage Site 3. Optimizing the canals' role in climate resilience 4. Minimizing environmental and social impacts (including on riparians downstream) 5. Achieving sustainable future operation and maintenance 6. Maximizing the use of local labor, particularly benefitting the most vulnerable households 7. Be economically justifiable 8. Be within the available budget. The study should be undertaken in close consultation at all times with the BRE, the national PPCR team, the provincial and district authorities, and the National Heritage Conservation Commission, to ensure that the design is optimized to local conditions. C. Sequencing The study would involve the following estimated sequencing (the consultant should be f ree to propose its own approach): (a) A preliminary desk review of relevant information (b) A participatory socio -economic and an environmental assessment of the sub -basin, as relevant to the management of the targeted canals (c) Carry out a detailed technical and engineering assessment to determine the role of the targeted canals in (i) strengthening climate resilience for the local population, and(ii) flood management downstream. (d) With the strict participation of local authorities, and using the above assessments, evaluate options to rehabilitate and improve the management of the canals in climate resilience (flood and droughts). This should include an assessment of the best options for rehabilitation and sustainable operation and maintenance, bas ed on both local as well as international experience. (e) Based on the above evaluations, propose the optimal design for PPCR Phase II interventions, from a physical as well as institutional point of view. This should include an economic and sensitivity analysis according to World Bank standards. (f) Based on the above assessments, carry out an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment of the proposed option(s), and prepare an Environmental and Social Management Plan, in accordance with the guidelines of the Zambia Environmental Management Agency and the applicable Safeguard Policies of the World Bank. (g) Design the detailed operational procedures for the proposed interventions, including schedule, costing, fund flow and proposed procurement packages. (h) Prepare the bidding documents (if applicable) and assist the client during the procurement process. The assessment would therefore be into three major parts, below: I. Technical Assessment - including (a), (c) and (d) above. II. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment - including (b) and (f) above III. Conceptual Design - including (e), (g) and (h) above. 3. Proposed Scope of Work The scope of work to be carried out by the consultant shall include but may not be limited to the following: 8. Bibliograp hical sources g:\\brl\\esia\\scoping \\scopingesia -barotse.docx / Eric Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 147 Part II: Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Background The scope of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) will cover all potential environmental and social, impacts, (positive and negative) that are likely to result from the implementation of activities related to the proposed rehabilitation o f canals in the Barotse basin, taking into account the prevailing socio -cultural and environmental context. Rehabilitation interventions will be designed with strict observance of traditional management structures, the sub -basin's role in flood management , and its status as a Ramsar site and potential World Heritage Site. The legislation, regulations, policies and guidelines that will govern the conduct of the impact assessment include the following: National laws, guidelines, and/or regulations on environmental assessments relevant for sustainable use/management of natural resources in Zambia; Regional, provincial or communal environmental assessment regulations; and The 10 World Bank Safeguard Operational Policies. The Table below shows the World Bank safeguard policies that are likely to be triggered by this project. \"TBD\" implies \"To be determined\" through the on -going preparation studies. The Consultants should become familiar with the policies that are triggered and marked as \"TBD\" in the tab le below, as well as with previously successful ESIAs carried out in the context of World Bank projects . Safeguard Policies Triggered by the Project Yes No TBD Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 X Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 X Forests OP/BP 4.36 X Pest Management OP 4.09 X Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 X Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 X Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 X Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 X Projects on International Waterways OP/BP 7.50 X Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 X . The project has in principal been rated as Environmental Category B due to the sensitive environmental and social aspects in the Barotse Sub -basin. This may preclude some re - design options which could have a significant environmental impacts if the consult ant judges that such requirement if needed which may merit a reclassification of the project, they should promptly inform the Government and the World Bank. The scope of work under the Environmental and Social Assessment will include the following: 8. Bibliographical sources g:\\brl\\esia\\scoping \\scopingesia -barotse.docx / Eric Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 148 A Scoping Study determining the scope of social and environmental issues to be addressed in the ESIA and to help identify the range of alternatives to be considered, potentially significant environmental and social impacts and potential mitigation measures to be analyzed in the ESIA. This could take place at the same time as some of the initial tasks carried out by the Technical Assessment. Identified issues from the scoping exercise would be used for updating the detailed terms of reference for the ESIA, as outlined below. The Scoping Study and updated TORs would need to be cleared by the Client and the Zambian Environmental Management Agency, and should therefore be completed by the time of the Inception Report. The ESIA proper should follow the outli ne on Annex A, and involve three sections: (i) An Environmental Assessment (EA), entailing an assessment of the potential environment impacts (positive and negative) anticipated from the activities involved in strengthening climate resilience of the canals in the Barotse basin. (ii) A Social Assessment (SA), articulated around social impacts (negative and positive) anticipated from activities involved in the rehabilitation of canals in the Barotse basin. (iii) An Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), outlinin g specific, feasible and cost -effective measures to prevent or reduce to acceptable levels any significant potential negative impacts. Completion of the ESIA is highly time sensitive, since it needs to be approved by both the Government of Zambia and the World Bank, and disclosed to involved stakeholders, 120 days prior to project presentation to the World Bank. For this reason, it is rec ommended that the Consultants start working on sections of the ESIA even before the final technical design is concluded. A final draft ESIA for review should therefore be completed by no later than September 15, 2012. The ESIA would involve the following specific tasks/information: Task II.A. Description of the Proposed Project : A summary description of the proposed investments, taken from Tasks I and III of this assignment, and including: (i) Description of the engineering and hydraulic aspects of the design, including such relevant aspects as topography, nature of flow, maximum and minimum discharge and canal depth at critical points; sediment load; (ii) Summary of the canal corridor survey, outlining major stakeholders, settlements, existing syste ms of canal uses (including merits and drawbacks), future water demand projections, critical issues and obstructions affecting the flow of the canals (iii) Summary of the proposed interventions, including scope (km, and location), estimated costs, implemen tation arrangements, and expected benefits. 8. Bibliographical sources g:\\brl\\esia\\scoping \\scopingesia -barotse.docx / Eric Environmental and Social impact Assessm ent for the improved use of priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 149 Task II.2. Description of the Socio -Economic and Environment Setting . Assemble and evaluate a baseline data on the social and environmental characteristics of the study area. Include information on any changes a nticipated before the project commences. (i) Physical environment : geology (general description for overall study area); topography; soils; monthly average temperatures, rainfall and runoff characteristics; ambient air quality; surface and ground water hydro logy; identity of streams, rivers, or lakes. Include limits of Ramsar site and the proposed World Heritage Site on a map. (ii) Biological environment : flora and fauna; rare or endangered species within or in areas adjacent to project -related development sites and any adjustments to the present alignment; sensitive habitats, including wetlands, terrestrial communities in areas affected by canals, land application or disposal; aquatic communities in affected waters; significant natural habitats; species of comme rcial importance in land application sites and receiving waters. (iii) Social environment : present and projected population benefiting and/or affected by the canal interventions; present land use/ownership; planned development activities; community structure; (iv) Cultural enviro nment: traditions, customs and aspirations; significant cultural, natural or historic sites. Importance of the project for the preservation and enhancement of cultural traditions. This should include a mapping of relevant cultural sites, which will be critically important to the siting of the canals (to prevent possible negative impacts). (v) Stakeholder identification: Identify the stakeholders, their needs, interests and aspirations, including the final recipients of the project who can positively or negatively be affected by project, and those which can affect the results or influence it (vi) Social -economic profiles: information on population per group of age, gender, social structures, vulnerable households (e.g. widows, elderly), employm ent trend and sources of income including the production and marketing activities in which the people are engaged, existing land tenure, access to services and public utilities, use of community and natural resources, and public health (including presence of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases). If at all available, emphasize any socio -economic information that is relevant to vulnerability to climate change. These profiles should be complemented by information from participative observations a nd informal interviews. (vii) Institutional aspects: identify the main institutions and organizations (formal and informal) in relation to the project; evaluate the structure, competence, and capacity of these institutions and organizations to target the most vulnerable and address social aspects; set up the role of each relevant institution, both formal and informal, on the design, implementation and monitoring of the project interventions; include recommendations to reinforce their capacities. Task II.3. Po licy, Legal and Administrative Framework. Describe the relevant laws, regulations and standards that may apply to the canal area, governing water quality and 8. Bibliographical sources g:\\brl\\esia\\scoping \\scopingesia -barotse.docx / Eric Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use o f priority traditional canals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 150 use, pollutant discharges to surface waters and land, health and safety, protection of sensitive a reas and endangered species, siting, land use control, etc., at international, national, regional and local levels. This section should also include a detailed description of World Bank safeguard policies and their relevance to the project to be implemente d. Task II.4 Determination of the Potential Impacts of the Proposed Project . . Identify all significant changes that the project is likely to generate, including potential social, economic, cultural and environmental changes. Address expected impact on the most vulnerable, on gender and people with HIV/AIDS. Distinguish between significant positive and negative impacts, direct, indirect and cumulative impacts, and immediate and long-term impacts. Include indirect impacts (e.g., increased erosion on ca nal banks, and other sensitive issues). Identify impacts that may occur due to unplanned or accidental events (e.g., spillage of toxic materials during rehabilitation works), and their potential risks. Identify impacts that are unavoidable or irreversible. Wherever possible, describe impacts quantitatively, in terms of environmental and social costs and benefits. Assign economic values when feasible. Characterize the extent and quality of available data, explaining significant information deficiencies and a ny uncertainties associated with predictions of impact. If necessary, provide TORs for studies to obtain the missing information. Task II.5 Analysis of Alternatives to the Proposed Project . Describe alternatives that were examined in the course of developing the proposed project and identify other alternatives that would achieve the same objectives. The concept of alternatives extends to siting and design of new alignments, rehabilitation techniques and phasing, and operating and maintenance procedures. Compare alternatives in terms of potential environmental impacts, capital and operating costs (including mitigation measures and their monitoring),and institutional, training, and monitorin g requirements. To the extent possible, quantify the costs and benefits of each alternative, incorporating the estimated costs of any associated mitigating measures. Task II.6 Development of an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) . Prepare a de tailed mitigation plan, outlining feasible and cost -effective measures to prevent or reduce to acceptable levels any significant negative impacts. Estimate the impacts and costs of the mitigation measures and of the institutional and training requirements to implement them. If appropriate, assess compensation to affected parties for impacts that cannot be mitigated. This should include reviewing the Resettlement Policy Framework prepared for the entire PPCR project and making any adjustments or refinements that may be needed to take into consideration potential effects from canal rehabilitation. The ESMP should identify a proposed work program, budget estimates, schedule, staffing and training requirements, and other necessary support to implement the mitig ating measures. Include measures for emergency response to accidental events (e.g. entry of raw sewage or toxic wastes into rivers, streams, etc). Task II.7 Development of a Monitoring Plan Prepare a detailed plan to monitor the implementation of mitigat ing measures and the impacts of the project during rehabilitation and operation and maintenance (e.g. emission and ambient levels of pollutants where these may be detrimental to human health, soil erosion, changes in the floodplain). Include in the plan an estimate of capital and operating costs and a description of other inputs (such as 8. Bibliographical sources g:\\brl\\esia\\scoping \\scopingesia -barotse.docx / Eric Environmental and Social impact Assessment for the improved use of priority traditional ca nals in the Barotse sub -basin of the Zambezi 151 training and institutional strengthening) needed to implement the plan. Include a schedule of monitoring the quality and flow of surface and ground waters to ensure that mi tigation measures are effective. Provide guidance for effective enforcement and the conduct of environmental audits. This should include any environmental or social protection clauses that should be included in contracts or specifications. Review the capa city of project institutions to implement the ESMP, and propose steps to strengthen them so that the ESMP may be effectively implemented. The recommendations may extend to new inter -sectoral arrangements, training, staffing, and financial support. Task I I..8. Assist in Inter -Agency Coordination and Public/NGO Participation . The Consultant will assist the government in coordinating the EA consultations with relevant agencies, BRE representatives, NGOs and with community groups likely to be affected or to benefit from the proposed project. Thesegroups should be consulted during preparation of the ESIA as well as when a draft ESIA is available (a summary of relevant materials and/or the ESIAshould be made available prior to the meetings). The draft ESIA should also be available in a public place accessible to affected groups and local NGOs being consulted, in a form and language that they understand. The Consultant should maintain a record of all public consultations undertaken, including (i) the date and location of the consultation meetings; (ii) a list of the attendees, with their affiliation and contact addresses; (iii) summary minutes; and (iv) whether means other than verbal consultation were used (e.g. surveys) to elicit the views of potentially af fected stakeholders. Task II.9 Reporting. The consultant will prepare, for discussion with the Government and the World Bank, an ESIA report that is concise and limited to significant environmental and social issues. The main text should focus on findings, conclusions and recommended actions, supp orted by summaries of the data collected and citations for any references used in interpreting those data. Detailed or uninterrupted data are not appropriate in the main text and should be presented in appendices or a separate volume. Unpublished documents used in the assessment may also be assembled in an appendix. Please see Annex A for the proposed outline of the ESIA. In addition, the social and environmental team should provide the following outputs, to be incorporated into Part III of the assignme nt and the Project's Implementation Manual. Implementation modalities that ensure a fully participatory and socially inclusive process Criteria for targeting the most vulnerable (e.g. in cash -for-works schemes) Criteria for water user organizations consid ered to be sufficient to proceed to rehabilitation and sustainable O&M A monitoring framework with clear baseline data and measurable results - to the maximum extent possible, it should include participatory score cards to enable a learning -by-doing approa ch amongst beneficiary communities.
