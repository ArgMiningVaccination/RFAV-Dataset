It emerged from the Vedic wisdom expounded by the ancient seers of the culture that arose in the Himalayan foothills. It is a science-based healthcare approach which promotes wellbeing and treats illness through assessment of the biochemically unique aspects of each patient and individually tailored interventions to restore psychological and physiological imbalances. This year we have seen a record number of students wanting to join the College of Ayurveda and Yoga Therapy and we are proud that we are able to continue teaching to our high standards even in the midst of this pandemic. The College of Ayurveda and Yoga Therapy (UK) was established in 1997 under the aegis of the Ayurveda Medical Association (UK). Based on the advice of the department of AYUSH, New Delhi under the leadership of Dr Mauroof M Athique. The college offers the most comprehensive curriculum in the field of Ayurvedic Medicine and Yoga Therapy based on a blended learning approach, in the United Kingdom. Registered as an educational institute at Companies House in 2000 the College developed a collaborative partnership with Middlesex University offering Ayurvedic practitioner-level programmes. The College of Ayurveda has been recognised as a centre of excellence by the Complementary Medical Association and it is the only institute to have been associated with a British University. As the premier educator of those seeking to make a difference through a career restoring the natural balance of body, mind and spirit, the college has, since its inception pursued its mission of bringing the wisdom of Ayurveda to the West. The college is accredited by the British Complimentary Medicines Association (BCMA) and is also pioneering Ayurvedic education in France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Croatia and Japan. The College is committed to making Ayurvedic education accessible to all and promoting healthy living in this turbulent time. Further Information Enrolment for 2020 has finished and we will be preparing to open our 2021 enrolment in May to start in September 2021.

For a major UK discovery[1] shows that drinking a litre per day of mineral water, naturally rich in silicic acid, safely removes immuno-suppressant and neurotoxic aluminium through urine.[2] It's the result of a lifetime's research led by the world authority on aluminium, Professor Christopher Exley and his team of scientists at Keele University. His research shows that this modern metal, and its salt form alum, is neurotoxic - and ubiquitous as an additive in many foods, bakery, infant formula milk power, cosmetics, medications, tap water, and it is even in polluted air we breathe in our busy streets. Aluminium is an immuno-suppressant,[3] unwittingly absorbed in our daily lives, adding to a neurotoxic body burden of a modern metal that nature has never adapted us to deal with. New Initiative for Practitioners Now free samples of a silica-rich bottled water called Acilis by Spritzer\u00ae are being made available with discounts for practitioners to offer clients with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, MS, epilepsy and autism. New Research Planned Separate from - but identically based on Professor Exley's research - it is aimed at continuing to measure the effects of silica-rich water on such disorders. This new initiative is a joint enterprise involving Homeopath, Peter Smith FSHom, from Cornwall, whose 37 years of practice has closely engaged with patients affected by aluminium and Silicawaters.com\u00ae - the UK suppliers of Acilis by Spritzer\u00ae used exclusively in Exley's pilot study. This small privately-owned limited company - a certified Not-for-Profit Social Enterprise for Good, was set up 5 years ago by retired journalist Rex Garratt and wife Wendy, after they were inspired by Professor Exley's research, which used thousands of bottles of donated Acilis water. \"Since then many families impacted by neurological disorders have shared how silicawater has made a difference to their lives\",[4] said Rex. \"And we have pledged to donate a portion of any eventual profit towards further research into the effects of silica rich water.\" The properties of silica-rich water are not simply that of eliminating aluminium. It also has the long-accepted rejuvenating power of silica in naturally boosting body collagen for improved tissue connectivity.[5] Meaning softer skin, stronger hair and nails, supple joints and stronger bones.[6] Recent research also shows its effect on the heart.[7] References 1.Human exposure to aluminium: [https://www.keele.ac.uk/aluminium/research/humanexposuretoal/](https://www.keele.ac.uk/aluminium/research/humanexposuretoal/) and [http://www.siliconrich.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/13.jpg](http://www.siliconrich.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/13.jpg) 7.

The third edition of 'The Essence of Clinical Aromatherapy' international seminar will be held 21-22 May 2021 via a professional virtual conference and trade show platform. The focus of this seminar is on the application and integration of essential oils in clinical settings including hospital, hospice, aged care facilities, paediatrics and psychiatry. Along with lectures from more than 20 experts from around the world, the event also provides live networking and the opportunity to connect directly with suppliers of essential oils and related products. Rhiannon Lewis, host and organiser of this event says \"Clinical Aromatherapy is evolving at a fast pace and our knowledge and skills need remain in step. The importance of staying current and learning more about our art and science can never be overemphasised. Hosting The Essence of Clinical Aromatherapy Seminar online in 2021 provides more opportunity for participants to attend from around the world. This important seminar thereby gives the global clinical aromatherapy community a dynamic platform and opportunity for sharing, exchange and learning.\" If you are interested in clinical aromatherapy or are already working in clinical settings with essential oils, this educational event is likely to be your main educational resource for 2021.

Our Focus: - Requiring fully informed consent for all testing, medical interventions and vaccines. - Campaigning for the freedom to choose not to accept testing, medical interventions and vaccines, without penalty or restrictions. - Educating on the limitations of the PCR test, which is not a suitable clinical diagnostic tool and should therefore not be used to inform government pandemic policy. - Requiring transparency of information. For example, the intention for the criterion of success of the Covid vaccine trials merely to be a reduction in moderate symptoms, without considering a reduction in hospitalisation and death, as well as the use of non-placebos, such as the meningitis vaccine, as the control in current trials. - Analysing and publicising flaws in the Covid vaccine trials designs and results. For example, the potential harm of the vaccine may outweigh the benefit for some people and trials are not designed to show if severe outcomes such as hospitalisations or deaths are reduced. - Calling for research to be undertaken by independent bodies, not those that stand to gain financially based on a particular trial outcome. - Exposing conflicts of interest and calling for health policies to be formulated by those that do not stand to gain financially from the use of a product. - Calling for true placebos to be used in vaccine trials. - Exposing and publicising other COVID-19 inaccuracies, inconsistencies and potential threats to our freedoms and health. - Educating both Members of Parliament and their scientific and medical advisors on these issues, offering a scientific resource for academics and journalists and providing a layman's summary of these resources to be made available to the public.

We make some of this learning available in a flexible format and at an affordable price to those many hundreds of dedicated music leaders who bring so much singing pleasure to our communities and yet who can't afford the time or money for formal post grad education to enhance their human and musical skills.\" The Certificate in Song Therapy course particularly celebrates the role of popular music in providing a fun and accessible way for people to get involved in community music. The course is offered on line over twelve to twenty four months with additional ZOOM based tutorial support. It encourages responsible leadership and sensitive aware delivery. \"We are extremely careful about ensuring students are aware of the limits of what can be responsibly achieved in informal music making settings\", says Nigel, \" this includes some of the dangers that music, as such a powerful force in people's lives, can sometimes present. We really hope that our learning programme and wider support of independent community music makers will serve to enhance the role of musicians working informally in the community and social care. Ultimately to the benefit of all of those with whom we share our music.\" Eight students will have qualified by the end of this year and a further fifteen to twenty, from the UK, Ireland and beyond are in the pipeline for 2021. The course currently has 79 enrolled students. To find out more contact Nigel at [nigelneill@songtherapy.net](mailto:nigelneill@songtherapy.net) or visit the website. A classroom based diploma course is planned for 2022 and the course is accredited by Complementary Health Professionals and only available at the moment through the Song Therapy Network.

Paperback. \u00a314.99 / $13.99. ISBN: 978 1 913088 16 3 Synopsis This no-nonsense guide shows you how an understanding of anatomy and biomechanics, coupled with the latest strengthening exercises and rehab protocols, can keep you running injury free for a long time to come. Each time your foot hits the ground while running, an impact force averaging three times your weight travels through your body at more than 200 miles per hour, causing your bones to vibrate and tendons to stretch. When you consider the average runner strikes the ground more than 10,000 times per hour, this translates into a remarkable amount of force that needs to be absorbed, and explains why nearly 50% of recreational runners are injured each year. The purpose of this book is to show you that impact forces are not necessarily harmful. By modifying your running form and doing specific exercises to improve tendon resiliency, not only can you effectively absorb these forces, but you can also store and return a significant percentage of them in the form of elastic recoil. Besides reducing your risk of injury, efficiently storing and returning energy can allow you to run faster with less effort. With more than 200 illustrations and 300 references, this book reviews how to: - Perform an at-home gait analysis to make specific changes in your running form that can reduce impact forces and improve performance; - Decrease your risk of injury by identifying problems with strength, flexibility, and/or neuromotor coordination using specific functional tests; - Incorporate new exercises to enhance the storage and return of energy in your tendons. - Select the running shoe that is right for you; - Treat 25 of the most common running-related injuries with the most up-to-date, scientifically justified treatment protocols available.

A migraine is a throbbing, intense headache in one half of the head. It can affect people of all ages. The cause of migraine is not known. During an attack, the blood vessels in the brain dilate and then draw together with stimulation of nerve endings near the affected blood vessels. These changes to the blood vessels are probably what cause the pain, but migraine headaches is a condition that is poorly understood. What are the Typical Features of Migraine? People often use the word migraine to refer to headaches of many different types. So-called classical migraine attacks have several features: - Headaches that occur in bouts of between roughly 4 to 72 hours; - Headaches usually affect one side of the head at a time, although both sides may be affected in separate attacks; - Headaches are usually throbbing and worsened by normal physical activity nausea and/or vomiting; - Preceding symptoms, called the 'aura' that most often are visual, such as zigzag lines or flashing lights across or at the edges of the fields of vision - Other symptoms can include sensitivity to light and sound, or non-visual aura such as a sensation of tingling in the body. What is Unique about Migra-Cap \u00ae The Migra Cap\u00ae, developed for migraine sufferers by a migraine sufferer, is unique amongst migraine treatments as it combines cold therapy and complete darkness to provide relief from the pain associated with a migraine and most types of headaches. This 2-in-1 migraine solution is unique for any Migraine treatment product with the added benefit of being a one-off purchase. What's more, this drug-free product is also ideal for pain relief during pregnancy. Drug Free Relief Migra-Cap helps to relieve pain and suffering by limiting exposure to the key elements that can prolong or enhance a migraine attack, remedies that utilise drugs such as Aspirin, Paracetemol and Butalbital can have side effects, consumption issues or even produce allergic reactions. More powerful painkillers eg Paramax, Migramax, Domperamol can require strict dosage guidelines and are often expensive to purchase. Sports Applications Migra-Cap can help to relieve pain and swelling caused by nearly all types of sports injuries. The Migra-Cap\u00ae can aid with the treatment and relief of pain, blows to the head and concussions. The cooling effect can aid in the reduction of swelling and can help limit post concussion swelling or brain injury.

Our students come from a variety of backgrounds both in conventional and holistic disciplines. This allows an exchange of information and experience that enriches the learning experience. Courses are mixture of leading-edge, scientifically based theory and clinical and practical tuition. Students are encouraged to explore and develop their gifts and talents in bringing their unique experience to the disciplines taught. Students are thus empowered. Top: Jonathan Lawrence BA DO Cert Ed and Rosemary Lawrence Dip BFD Cert Clin Hom Cert Ed Bottom: Craniosacral Course 2019 Small groups help to facilitate this experience. Turning Point teachers are enthusiastic and experienced practicing therapists who keep their knowledge up to date. The philosophy of Turning Point encompasses the idea that medicine is an art informed by science. We believe that the conventional materialist paradigm is very much out of date and that scientific knowledge has now reached a point where much of holistic medicine can incorporated into a new paradigm. Turning Point courses introduce the concepts of research and encourage students to critically evaluate current information. Craniosacral therapy is based on the relation of the relationship between the structure and function of the body and health. Specific, gentle and skilled manipulation can restore the structure-function relationship supporting the patients' own homeostatic mechanisms. This non-invasive and safe therapy can be used on patients of all ages from the new-born to the elderly. This course is led by Jonathan Lawrence The Practitioner Course is a post graduate course consisting of 8 modules over 10 days including practical tuition. The modules include: - Anatomy and Physiology; Palpation - Basic and Advanced Techniques - Clinical Skills; Visceral Immune System and Lymphatics. - Mother/Baby and Reproductive - Physical and Emotional Trauma - Dental, Facial and Cranial Base. In addition students have to complete a portfolio of cases and complete an exam. Practical skills are assessed during the course. This course is recognised by the CMA. Homotoxicology is based on the idea that disease results from toxic load. In modern life we are subject to toxins from a variety of sources. This has the effect of stressing the immune system leading to ill health. Accurate prescribing can help the body to gently detoxify aiding the restoration of homeostasis.The remedies used are be single potency homeopathic remedies or combinations of remedies to achieve a specific physiological response. There is access to online training via the Society of Homotoxicology We provide further courses in Electro Acupuncture According to Voll (EAV) for suitably qualified students. This involves electro-acupuncture assessment of meridans and clinical application of findings. Training is via small tutorial groups led by Rosemary Lawrence.

Should clinicians consider the use of mushroom nutrition to: - Reduce neuroinflammation; - Combat viral infections that are triggering early stage (MCI) and late stage dementia; - Establish a healthy microbiota in patients with such conditions; - Increase neurogenic reserve. In essence, can mushroom nutrition slow the progression of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u00b4s disease by acting as a disease modifying therapy until a pharmaceutical product can be approved? Impact of Microbiome on Neurodegeneration-Gut Brain Axis The gut-brain axis is a complex system of interactions between the gut microbiota and the enteric and central nervous systems. It has been hypothesised that this bi-directional communication may be partly mediated via neurotransmitters. The gut microbiota influences the brain. The microbiota produces neurotransmitters (such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid) and specific bacterial metabolites, which affect the enteric and central nervous systems and impact immune and inflammatory responses. It is no surprise, therefore, that there is growing evidence supporting the concept that there is a link between dysbiosis and human behaviour, autism and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Bioactive Properties of Mushroom Nutrition - Exploratory Studies Over the past 3 years, Mycology Research Laboratories has been working with a group of researchers, led by Professor Manuela Pintado at the School of Biotechnology in the Catholic University in Porto (Portugal), to determine the bioactive properties of mushroom nutrition. Based on a previous study that noted the impact of Coriolus versicolor on the microbiota, Professor Pintado chose to conduct studies on this strain of mushroom to seek to understand its characteristics and activity as a prebiotic. Figure 1: Simulation of gastrointestinal conditions.19 (adapted) Prebiotic Activity is Strain-Dependent A study to assess the prebiotic potential of mushroom biomass compared the growth of different probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus of Coriolus versicolor biomass, glucose or a negative control. The mushroom biomass was either intact or had been submitted to a simulated gastrointestinal tract (GIT) digestion (to simulate conditions that would follow ingestion of the biomass) (see Figure 1). Table 1: Bacterial growth (vs glucose) in the presence of Coriolus versicolor biomass. Bacterial growth after the 48th hour of incubation at 37\u00baC. Growth was measured by enumeration of viable microorganisms (CFU/mL). ++, same level of growth compared with glucose; +, weaker growth compared with glucose; - no growth. Results (Table 1) suggest that Coriolus versicolor (biomass) has a potential strain-dependent prebiotic effect, with higher activity on the Bifidobacterium animalis B0. Further analysis of the incubation medium revealed that fermentation of Coriolus versicolor biomass by Lactobacillus paracasei L26 increased the concentrations of acetic and lactic acid (vs the glucose and negative controls). Together, these results suggest that Coriolus versicolor acts as a substrate for fermentation by beneficial bacterial species, and that the consequent production of SCFA by some of these species might contribute to conditions (lower pH and preservation of the gut barrier) that support a healthy gut. Prebiotic Activity Inhibits Cell Adhesion Prebiotic agents can have an indirect inhibitory effect on the growth of pathogenic bacteria through a combination of their selective fermentation by probiotic bacteria in the colon (as discussed above) and their anti-adhesive properties (adhesion of undesirable bacteria to host tissue being the first step in pathogenesis). Therefore, prebiotic supplementation is another potential strategy to inhibit the growth of undesirable bacteria. Professor Pintado tested the inhibitory effect of the pre-digested Coriolus versicolor on three Its effect on adhesion of these pathogens to mucus was evaluated in vitro using mucin (Type II Sigma-Aldrich) as a model of intestinal mucus. The results showed an inhibitory effect of the Coriolus versicolor substrate on adhesion, especially in the case of Salmonella enterica, although the mechanism of this inhibition is, as yet, unknown. Additional studies are needed in mixed cultures and faecal samples in order to assess the bioactivity in an environment with a complex bacterial population. r Figure 2: Postulated prebiotic activity of Coriolus versicolor (Mycology Research Laboratories) based on findings of Professor Pintado et al. ++, same level of growth compared with glucose; +, weaker growth compared with glucose; 0, no growth. Potential of Coriolus Versicolor for Neurological Support The in vitro work outlined above demonstrates that Coriolus versicolor biomass has a bifidogenic effect and induces positive changes in the gut microbiota. Acting as a prebiotic, Coriolus versicolor would support the immune system by maintaining the health of the microbiota, and potentially support neurological functions that are under the influence of the microbiota.

Paperback. $19.95. \u00a316.99. ISBN 9781603589727. From a doctor living with MS: how to radically improve your quality of life with diet, hormones, supplements, exercise, and other lifestyle adjustments. Most of us take for granted the little things in life - like walking out to the mailbox, socializing with friends, or enjoying a mug of hot coffee. But what if each daily activity required intensive planning and effort? That's what living with multiple sclerosis is like, and author Micha\u00ebl Friedman knows this from first-hand experience. Since his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis a decade ago, Dr Friedman has been searching for a cure for the disease. After years of research, he realized that he had some of the answers right in his naturopathic medicine toolbox, and others, surprisingly, lay in the realm of conventional medicine. There's No Pill for This tells his story and offers treatment advice and hope to those who suffer from MS. He does not promise a miracle cure but instead provides the personal prescriptions he follows that are delaying the disease process and radically improving his quality of life, including dietary measures and supplements to support a healthy microbiome and hormone therapies that can reduce neuroinflammation and possibly promote neurorestoration. Dr Friedman presents a daily protocol for MS patients, including diet, supplement, detoxification, and hormone strategies; mindfulness therapy; physical therapy; and a wide range of beneficial lifestyle adjustments related to exercise, sleep routines, time management, stress management, and more. He also offers special advice for supporting healthy bladder and bowel function and improving oxygen supply. In the book's conclusion, Dr. Friedman reflects on what this complicated chronic disease has taught him, and continues to teach him, about the value of humility and about what is truly important in life. About Micha\u00ebl Friedman Naturopathic physician Dr Micha\u00ebl Friedman is the founder of the Association for the Advancement of Restorative Medicine and the Journal of Restorative Medicine. He also creates and formulates herbal and nutritional supplements, and is cofounder and president of the Restorative Formulations supplement company. He is the author of the medical textbook Fundamentals of Naturopathic Endocrinology, a contributing author of Evidence-Based Approach to Restoring Thyroid Health, and co-author of Healing Diabetes. He has treated patients with illnesses ranging from lymphoma to liver cancer, achieving remarkable results that have been published in several medical journals. He lives with his family in Montpelier, Vermont.

Known as the 'miracle' or 'drumstick tree', the leaves, bark, flowers, fruit, seeds, and roots of moringa are all used traditionally throughout Asia for a host of claimed health benefits. Research continues[1,2,3] to highlight, that on top of its traditional use, moringa could also help our bodies and livers better protect themselves from the onslaught of 'poisons'. In the studies scientists looked at the effect on animal livers of moringa extracts when exposed to poison. Under normal circumstances the liver helps filter toxins from the body, but excess exposure over time can cause lasting damage to the organ and prevent it from working efficiently. In numerous studies, scientists have found that moringa extracts can help reduce markers of liver damage and improve the condition of the liver's cells when exposed to poison, indicating the plant somehow has a protective effect on the body. How to Include Moringa in your Diet this Christmas Natur Boutique's organic moringa tea offers one of the easiest and tastiest ways to feel the benefits of the plant. The tea is one of the only organic versions available and uses the leaves of the moringa tree to create a drink that is 100% pure and free of additives, flavourings or preservatives. With a robust rich flavour, the tea offers a great way to give yourself a natural and beneficial boost.
