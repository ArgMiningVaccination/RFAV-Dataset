In particular, [chiropractic care](/chiropractor). However, when you look at the benefits that chiropractic care provides, it's clear why millennials are choosing it. It is cleaner and more effective. It's holistic and doesn't treat every patient the same, something millennials feel strongly about. Why else is the millennial generation pulling away from drugs and traditional healthcare? The Millennial Mindset and Why It Matters So what is it about millennials that make them favor new natural medicine and chiropractors? One reason is the fact that many millennials are now thinking outside the box about their health. They are willing to look beyond for the truth in regards to some of the [Myths About the Chiropractic Practice](/category/blog/common-myths-about-chiropractic-care) The millennial generation is also thinking more creatively. It is clear that millennials are trying to change the world in a more positive manner. Moreover, as [research and statistics are showing](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/14/Millennials-Embrace-Alternative-Medicine-32-Billion-Business), natural methods of medication seem to be on that agenda. Millennials Are Not Happy With the Way Things Are With Healthcare Millennials are surprisingly health-conscious, but their generation is looking for alternative healthcare options. Some argue that the reason this is happening is that young people don't like being treated the same. And unfortunately, for the majority of the medical industry, millennials don't tend to enjoy being given standard treatments for problems. They don't like to take prescription drugs, and that's why more holistic treatments are becoming more common. What Benefits Does Chiropractic Care Offer Patients? So now that we understand why millennials are voting for natural treatments like chiropractic care, it is important to evaluate the benefits that come along with such a thing. Holistic and Treats the Patient Like a Person As we have already discussed, chiropractic care is a holistic treatment. It treats everybody as individuals with their own health concerns as the doctor can personalize the therapy to the individual. Something that you won't find with drug treatment. This makes them feel like a human, and it makes them feel comfortable and welcomed. Because of this careful consideration of the patient, chiropractic success rates are higher, and there is a reduced chance of relapse. It Can Be More Effective than Traditional Medicine with Certain Problems Through a vast amount of research, it has been found that chiropractic care can be more effective than traditional medicine. However, this only applies in some situations with pain relief being the most regularly treated issue. When it comes to pain relief, many people will opt-in for chiropractic care, especially if their pain is chronic. Chiropractic care can also be used for the more common problem of headaches. Everybody experiences them but when they become consistent, you have a real problem on your hands. A chiropractic can make adjustments to the neck and relieve any stress that is present. Of course, as well as pain relief, chiropractic care can also rectify other problems, including: - Ear infections - this is especially important in children. Here you can learn more about ear infections and chiropractic care - Bowel regularity suitable for both constipation and IBS - Mental clarity - Preventing Scoliosis Long-term Results and No Dependency on Drugs One of the most prevailing benefits of chiropractic care that millennials prefer is the fact it lasts in the long-term. The effects of your sessions last for years to come, and you can have a plan drawn out that will give you exercise routines and personalized development techniques. People that get chiropractic care also state that the treatment also helps them shift their mindset. Not only does their health improve, but many patients will go on to be healthier and happier. In addition, unlike when you take drugs, there are no issues when it comes to dependencies. You can get a few treatments and have your pain removed, even if it's chronic. You won't need to continually attend your sessions, but you might need to do a few check-ups just to see how you're doing. The therapy is freeing and you will feel like a new person once you've tried it. What Is Wrong With Drugs? I know I have been praising natural treatments, but drugs have their place in this world. The main benefit of drugs is that they give you quick, easy relief that you can buy with a short trip to the store. They're also scientifically tested to see if they are effective with the health issue they're supposed to solve. They're often placed against a placebo to see if they produce a more effective response. It's the scientific testing that they go through which makes them a trusted source to go to when you're in pain. Side Effects of Drugs With all the benefits they provide, drugs also have a number of effects that we would rather do without. In fact, some drugs produce side effects that are so detrimental to your health that they can kill you, even if they're taken a single time. Because of this, you are often prescribed multiple drugs that are designed to counteract each other, protecting you against any mishaps. So when you go to your doctor to get one pain killer, you end up leaving with three. This makes it is clear why the new generation is beginning to reject this overused system. Drugs Have Short-term Benefits Another thing millennials see about drugs is that they don't tackle root causes. They cannot cure the underlying issue that is causing the pain in the first place. What they can do, however, is cure the symptoms. This is analogous to hearing your smoke detector go off and instead of checking where the fire is, you just pull the batteries out of the detector. This is not a desirable outcome because it means that, if you want continuous relief, you have to take the drugs every day. This is one of the reason why chronic pain sufferers eventually give up on drugs or become addicted. In addition, if you use certain drugs too much your body becomes immune to their effects. Clearly, another course of action needs to be taken. People don't deserve to be kept on drugs for the rest of their lives. Natural Medicine vs. Drugs: Can Natural Medicine Be a Full Replacement? You're probably wondering that if natural methods are more beneficial, why don't we switch automatically? Well, as I have mentioned above, although drugs can cause horrible side effects and can only be used in the short-term, they do have a purpose. They're convenient and in a pinch, they can be exactly what your body needs to save your life. They're also specialized to a number of medical problems that cannot be fixed with natural remedies like illness and bacterial infections. However, when it comes to pain relief and common problems with movement, chiropractors can definitely help and are often more effective than traditional medicine. A number of research studies have identified that patients have experienced more relief from continuous therapy than they have with normal medication. It is also now common for professionals to suggest chiropractic treatment over more expensive methods like surgery. It is clear the world is slowly changing and with the rise of the millennials, people want natural medical treatments like chiropractic care. Those treatments are coming into fashion and will be used more regularly over traditional methods in the near future. The Bottom Line The mindset of millennials is slowly taking over and it is becoming more focused on holistic treatment and natural remedies. Only time can tell how popular holistic treatments will become. As a result, people want treatments like chiropractic care, especially when it comes to common issues like back pain. In most cases, studies have found that chiropractic care is more effective than traditional methods and they have less nasty surprises.
