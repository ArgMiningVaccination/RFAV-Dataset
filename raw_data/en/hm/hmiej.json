The extract from the root of Polygala tenuifolia was found to contain potent mucosal adjuvant activity. The active substances were purified and identified as onjisaponins A, E, F and G. Two inoculations of mice with onjisaponin F (1 \u00b5g) and influenza HA vaccine (1 \u00b5g) at 3 weeks intervals, significantly increased serum HI antibody and nasal anti-influenza virus IgA and IgG antibody titers after only 1 week over mice given HA vaccine alone after the secondary vaccination. Intranasal vaccination with onjisaponin F inhibited proliferation of mouse adapted influenza virus A/PR/8/34 in bronchoalveolar lavages of infected mice. Onjisaponins also showed adjuvant effect for intranasal vaccination of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine. Traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) formulation, Sho-seiryu-to (Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang in Chinese) showed oral adjuvant activity for nasally administered influenza vaccine. The active substance was isolated from one of the component herbs, the tuber of Pinellia ternata, and was identified as 9S, 12S, 13S-trihydroxy-10E-octadecenoic acid (pinellic acid) by spectroscopic and synthetic methods. Oral administration of pinellic acid (1 \u00b5g) to mice given primary and secondary intranasal inoculation of influenza HA vaccine (1 \u00b5g) enhanced antiviral IgA antibody titers in nasal and bronchoalveolar washes. Onjisaponins and pinellic acid showed negligible hemolytic activity at effective dose for adjuvant activity. The results of these studies suggest that onjisaponins and pinellic acid may provide safe and potent adjuvants for intranasal inoculation of influenza HA "}
