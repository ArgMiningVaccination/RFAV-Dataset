Explore the depths of medical arrogance in this in-depth review of the Wilk case. See: [ Nutritional MS., cure of a degenerative disease ever established, has been by a vitamin, mineral, or essential food factor. No prescription drug has EVER cured a SINGLE degenerative disease. While antibiotics can kill bacteria in the body and have no doubt saved lives that would otherwise have been lost since the discovery of penicillin, this does not mean that the bacteria is the CAUSE of the \"disease\" being treated nor does it mean that antibiotics are the BEST way to handle the situation because Klenner (MD)demonstrated way back in the fifties (published hospital studies, Southern Medical J) that intravenous vitamin C in megadoses kills off ANY infection known to man (including tetanus -lockjaw) without ANY harmful side effects. What is being treated when an antibiotice is used... is the SYMPTOM, not the disease, but that is another story for another day.
