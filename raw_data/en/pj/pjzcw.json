This provides the emotional and spiritual depth of traditional medical practitioners, as they truly make an effort to connect patients to their community even if they are severely ill (Abdullahi \u00b6 3). Finally, the Igbo tribe held many secret societies, including instruction in medicine, that held both secular and religious functions and allowed inducted community members to learn about its origins (\"Cults and Rituals\" 284).

One way this culture was different, was that they had health deities, which was nothing like the other civilizations and cultures researched had and another way being the society of Andhra truly believed that the world was controlled by the divine couple \"Pasupati and Mother Goddess\". \"The Mother Goddess was worshipped as the guardian of the nature protecting the human beings from the natural calamities and the epidemics, as the mother at home gives food for the health and protects the children and other dependents in the family from health hazards.\" . This quote reveals that people of Medieval Andhra tried to apprehend the roles of the first divine couple and gain a better understanding of how the divine couple created their world in the perspective of their socio cultural background. So readers can see why the Mother Goddess was so important in their daily lives. Another way that Medieval Andhra was different from other societies was that they used festivals throughout the seasons of the year in a way to uphold good physical and mental health within themselves. Hymavathi's document argues how indigenous medicine and religion correlated with each other and played a Many indigenous systems of medicine were totally neglected and lost their significance in maintaining health.

Ayurveda, which is widely practiced in India, helped start the movement of complimentary and alternative medicine in the west. Although there are only a few trained practitioners, Ayurveda is growing fast in the west. There is now a training program in New Mexico, and Dr. Deepak Chopra helped expand the knowledge of Ayurveda in the United States. Ayruveda gained plenty of recognition because it was thought to be successful in preventing and treating chronic conditions, or any illnesses western medicine can't treat (Professor Price, Ayurvedic Medicine Powerpoint). This alternative medicine would also be used by those who are desparate for a cure, and have no hope in western medicine. The different practices of Ayurveda also dramatically changed health care by developing treatments such as cleansing, diet, meditation, and spiritual healing. A widely popular practice that evolved that from Ayurveda is yoga. Yoga appeals to all people, and there are no requirements in engaging in the activity.

Rural areas easily attract doctors and other medical Eastern and Western Medicine The complex structure and foreign nature of Tibetan medicine makes it difficult to relate its practices to Western medicine, making it difficult to determine the clinical efficacy of Eastern medical practice. Several clinical analysis studies have recently been performed in order to determine the efficacy of the \"holistic\" practices of Eastern cultures.
