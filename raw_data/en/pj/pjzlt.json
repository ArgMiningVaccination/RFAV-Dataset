Runny nose. Sore throat. When these symptoms start, you might suspect you're coming down with a cold... or is it allergies? When it comes to cold vs. allergy symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two. These conditions are both quite common: American adults average one to two colds yearly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while allergies are the sixth most common cause of chronic illness in the U.S., according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Once you know which condition is causing your symptoms, you can better manage it \u2014 and your expectations. Keep reading to learn how to tell the difference between allergies and the common cold. Allergy symptoms occur when the immune system reacts to specific substances known as allergens. Common allergens include pollen, pet dander, dust and grass. Allergies are unique because of the great range of reactions and sensitivities. Some people have no allergies at all, while others have severe or even life-threatening reactions to certain allergens. When exposed to an allergen that someone is sensitive to, their immune system goes through a two-stage reaction: The common cold is caused by a viral infection, primarily rhinovirus. Similar to allergies, cold symptoms result from the immune system's reaction to the virus, triggering an inflammatory process. Cold symptoms usually last seven days but can persist for up to two weeks. Symptoms include sneezing, stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, coughing, post-nasal drip, watery eyes, and generally feeling unwell. Fever is a possible symptom but not a common one. While allergies and colds have overlapping symptoms, key differences can help identify and treat them, per guidance from the American Academy of Family Physicians. Most adults and children can manage the common cold symptoms or allergies without seeing a healthcare provider. Numerous effective over-the-counter (OTC) treatment options are available. A pharmacist can help you choose an OTC cold or allergy relief medicine that's safe for you. That being said, there are instances when medical attention is necessary. If your symptoms show no improvement after 10 days or worsen after three days, it's recommended to consult a healthcare provider. Immediate medical attention is warranted if you have trouble breathing, a prolonged fever, dizziness or dehydration due to severe vomiting or diarrhea. If someone knows the allergens that bother them, they can take steps to minimize their exposure to the allergen. For example, people allergic to pollen can try to stay indoors when pollen counts are high. When complete allergen avoidance isn't possible (which it often isn't), OTC treatment options are available. Allergy relief medications work by targeting the immune system's inflammatory process. The most highly recommended OTC allergy medications are antihistamines, available in oral, eye drop and intranasal forms. These drugs work to reduce or help prevent allergy symptoms by blocking histamine, a chemical released during the allergic response. They are safe for most adults. As well, most antihistamines are safe for children ages six and older. Conveniently, many antihistamines offer once-daily dosing. prescription: azelastine nasal ( [Astepro](https://www.riteaid.com/shop/catalogsearch/result/?q=Astepro)). If a stuffy nose and sinus pressure are bothersome symptoms, using a steroid nasal spray may be beneficial. In fact, pharmacists commonly recommend combining an antihistamine and an intranasal steroid to combat allergy symptoms and inflammation. The recommended children's ages for steroid nasal sprays vary, so be sure to check the product label or ask your pharmacist. Examples of OTC steroid no specific treatments are proven to prevent the common cold. Focus on maintaining good hand hygiene and avoiding contact with symptomatic people to reduce the risk of catching a cold. It's important to note that antibiotics are ineffective against the common cold as it's caused by a viral infection, and antibiotics only treat bacterial infections. Taking OTC medications may not be necessary if your cold symptoms are minor. Getting plenty of rest and increasing your fluid intake may be all you need. For symptom management, use OTC medications for relief. OTC analgesics, such as ibuprofen ( [Motrin](https://www.riteaid.com/shop/motrin-ibuprofen-200-mg-coated-caplets-50-caplets-0031082)) or acetaminophen ( [Tylenol](https://www.riteaid.com/shop/tylenol-pain-reliever-fever-reducer-extra-strength-500-mg-caplets-100-caplets-0031879)), help to relieve pain and reduce fever. Decongestants can provide short-term relief for nasal/sinus congestion and pressure. Antihistamines, on the other hand, help with sneezing, runny nose, itchy/watery eyes and itchy throat. Nasal decongestants are often combined with antihistamines in OTC products. That said, some people should avoid decongestants, particularly if they have high blood pressure or heart problems.

Allergies and the common cold often present with similar symptoms, making it easy to confuse the two. However, understanding the differences is helpful for proper symptom management and setting realistic expectations. Allergies require a long-term plan to identify and avoid allergens whenever possible, while colds typically resolve on their own within a couple of weeks. Correctly identifying the underlying condition will guide appropriate treatment with OTC treatments. If uncertainty persists, seeking advice from a healthcare provider is a good idea, especially if you have other medical conditions.
