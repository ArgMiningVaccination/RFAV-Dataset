Regular updates on treatment s and vaccines authori sed in the European Union to treat or prevent COVID -19 are provided by the EMA immunization to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 in individuals 18 y ears of age and older. Incidence and Prevalence: SARS -CoV -2 was first identified following reports of a cluster of acute respir atory illness cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 (L i 2020). It is a novel RNA virus from the family Coronaviridae, subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, and is most closely related (approximately 88% identical) to a group of SARS -like coronaviruses previously sampled from bats in China (Martin 2008, Wu 2020, L u2020). The identification of SARS- CoV -2 follows the emergence of 2 other novel beta-coronaviruses capable of causing severe human disease over the past 18 years: SAR S-CoV identified in Southern China in November 2002 and MERS -CoV isolated from a patient in Saudi Arabia who died of severe pneumonia and multi -organ failure in June 2012 (Lu 2020, WHO 2004, Zumla 2016). SARS -CoV -2 has spread rapidly and globall y since itsemergence. The WHO declared that the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on 11 March 2020 (WHO 2020a, WHO 2020b). As of 09 May 2022, over 516million cases and over 6.3million deaths from COVID -19 have been reported worldwide. Globally, over 4.0million new cases and 16,734 deaths were reported during the week of 25 April through 01 May 2022 (WHO 2022a ). As of 01 May 2022 ,138,908,085 cases and 1,087,139 deaths have been reported in the European Union/EEA (ECDC 2022 a), and 22,328,784 cases and 189,251 deaths have been reported in the United Kingdom (Johns Hopkins 2022 b). Ending 06 May 2022, the 14-day case notification rate for the European Union/EEA, based on pooled data collected by ECDC from official national sources from 29 countries, was 867.7 per 100,000 VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 9Over the course of the SARS -CoV -2 pandemic, there has been a continuous evolution of circulating SARS -CoV -2 variants. The reason why these strains seem to spread so quickl y is poorly understood and iscurrently a topic of intensive research (Lauring 2021, Plante 2020, Tegally 2020, de Souza 2022 ).Vaccine effectiven esshas been shown to be decreased including Omicron the WHO declared Omicron a variant of concern, and by 22 December 2021, the Omicron variant was detected in 110 countries (WHO 2021). Since its identification, Omicron has continued to evolve, leading to variants with slightly different genetic constellations of mutations (WHO 2022 b).As of 05 June 2022, the Omicron variant is the dominant variant of concern circulating globally according to the WHO (WHO 2022c ). Demographics of the Population within the Authorised Indication - Age, Sex, Racial and/or Ethnic Origin, and Risk Factors for the Disease Age SARS -CoV -2 infects people of all ages. However, people aged >60 years are at a higher risk of severe COVID -19 ( ECDC 2023 a).As of 13 May 2022, transmission continues to decline in most EUcountries, as shown by decreases in both overall case notification r ates and case rates among people aged 65 years and older. While decreasing, transmission in people aged 65 years and older is still at one of the highest levels in the pandemic (ECDC 2022c) .In the European Union/EEA, the risk of hospitalization and death increases sharply with age (ECDC 2021) . Sex Although there is no clear answer to the question of how much sex is influencing the health outcome of people diagnosed with COVID -19, in most countries with available data, mortality rates are consistently higher in men than in women (Global Health 50/50 2022).The ECDC reports previously included TESS (The European Surveillance System) anal ysis by demographics, noting thatmales had a higher risk of severe outcomes than females, particularl yinthe older age gr oups (ECDC 2021). Racial and/or Ethnic Origin Data on the characteristics of COVID -19 patients disaggregated by race/ethnicity remain limited. There is increasing evidence that some racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by COVID -19 (Price -Haywood 2020, Millett 2020, CDC 2022b,CDC 2022 c, ECDC 2020, Johns Hopkins 202 2a). Inequities in the social determinants of health affecting these groups, such as occupation, education, income, healthcare access, and housing, are interrelated and influence a wide range of health and quality -of-life outcomes and risks (ECDC 2020, Johns Hopkins 2022 a). Risk Factors for the Disease Risk factors increasing the risk for COVI D-19 infection are the type of employ ment (public facing) and not using non-pharmaceutical prevention methods (distancing and masking) (Chu 2020, Hiironen 2022 ).Demographic factors increasing the risk for a severe disease course are older age, JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 10male sex, and postmenopausal state. The most common pre-existing comorbidities and riskfactors in COVID -19 patients are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy , chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, obesity , weakened immune system , and smoking (Dessie 2021, Wolff 2021, Emami 2020, CDC 2022 c, CDC d). Main Existing Treatment and Prevention Options: Prophy laxis As of 10 January 2023, besides JCOVDEN , 6vaccines have received (conditional )marketing authorisation 2022 a): themRNA -based BNT162b2 vaccine from Beta from Pasteur . Therapeutics As of 24 June 2022 , the following treatments received (conditional )approval by the EMA for the treatment of the use of dexamethasone in COVID -19 patients on oxygen or mechanical ventilation (EMA 2020 c). Despite the ever growing number of available treatment options, an emphasis remains on disease prevention for global control of SARS -CoV -2. Since transmission of SARS -CoV-2 occurs primarily through respiratory secretions (droplets) and to a lesser extent via contact with contaminated surfaces, covering coughs and sneezes as well as social distancing (maintaining a distance of 1.5m or 6 feet from others) can reduce the risk of transmission. Mouth and nose coverings, if properl y pursued, may further reduce the spread of droplets from infectious individuals to others when social distancing is not possible. Furthermore, frequent handwashing and the use of hand sanitizer (>60% alcohol) are effective in reducing acquisition (CDC 2020). Finally , frequent testing for SARS -CoV -2, contact tracing, and local quarantine measures have shown to be effective in reducing virus spread. Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Unvaccinated Population, Including Mortality and Morbidity: SARS -CoV -2 can be transmitted from human to human by exposure to respiratory fluids carry ing virus (CDC 2021). Contact tracing studies confirm that prolonged close contact is the main risk factor for transmission and that the risk of infection is much higher in household contacts compared to nonhousehold contacts (Bi 2020, Burke 2020, WHO 2020c). Transmission may also occur indirectly through infected surfaces or fomites.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 11Approximately individuals will remain asymptomatic (Feehan 2021, Lavezzo 2020, Oran 2020). Respiratory symptoms of COVI D-19 typically appear 5 to 6 days following exposure to the virus, but may appear from 2 to 14 days following exposure, with the clinical manife stations ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness or death (CDC 2022 a, Guan 2020, Linton 2020, US San Diego Health 2022, WHO 2020d). In a systematic review and meta -analysis of 148 studies, including 127 studies from China, which comprised 24,410 adult s in 9 countries with laboratory confirmed COVID -19, the most prevalent symptoms were fever (78%), cough (57%), and fatigue (31%). Overall, 19% of hospitalized patients required non-invasive ventilation, 17% required intensive care, 9% required invasive ve ntilation, and 2% required extra - corporeal membrane oxygenation (Grant 2020). CDC descriptions of COVID -19 clinical case definitions and interviews with COVID -19-experienced clinicians sponsored by the MAH have included signs and s ymptoms of respiratory distress such as blue lips, extreme shortness of breath and dyspnea, persistent cough, deep vein thrombosis, discoloration of feet and toes, chills, shaking chills, loss of sense of taste and smell, signs of stroke, disorientation, inability to respond or understand verbal communication, among others. Other less common gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported by CDC (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ) (CDC 2022 a).Although SARS -CoV -2 primarily affects the lungs, it has been found to damage the vascular endothe lium of several other organs, resulting in complaints such as brain fog, palpitations, and fatigue. The extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID -19 vary, with the heart, brain, and kidney s being particularl y susceptible to damage (EClinicalMedicine 2020). This vascular component of COVID -19 might help to explain the observed prolonged illness, also seen in young adults without underly ing chronic medical conditions (Tenforde 2020). For the week ending 13May 2022, pooled data from 18EU/EEA countries showed thatthe hospital occupancy rate was 15.1COVI D-19 patients per 100,000 population. The ICU admission rate for the European Union/EEA, based on data reported by 10countries, was 0.5 per 100,000 population (country range: 0.1-1.0). The 14-day COVID -19 death rate for the European Union/EEA, based on data collected by ECDC from official national sources for 30countries, was 16.2 (country range: 0.0-42.0) per million population (ECDC 2022c). Important severe COVID -19 are hy pertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy , chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, obesit y, and weakened immune system.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA The nonclinical safet y profile of Ad26.COV2.S wasassessed in 2 pivotal GLP studies in NZW rabbits: a combined repeat -dose toxicity and local tolerance study anda combined EF-PPND toxicity study . Biodistribution studies (with 2other Ad26 -based vaccines ) were conducted in NZW rabbits to assess the distribution, persistence, and clearance of the Ad26 vector. The nonclinical safet y testing was consistent with applicable guidelines, including the WHO Guidelines on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005), the EMA Guideline on quality , non -clinical and clinical aspects of live recombinant viral vectored vaccines (EMA 2010), the ICH-S5 Guideline on detection of toxicity to reproduction for human pharmaceuticals (EMA 2020 a), and the FDA Guidance for Industry - Considerations for developmental toxicity studies for preventive and therapeutic vaccines for i nfectious disease indications (FDA 2006). In line with the applicable guidelines, safet y pharmacology , genotoxicity , and carcinog enicit conducted with Ad26.COV2.S. The nonclinical biodistribution and safet y studies were conducted using the I M route, which is the route for use of Ad26.COV2.S in humans. The rabbit was considered a relevant toxicological species since Ad26.COV2.S was shown to elicit an immune response against the SARS -CoV -2 S protein encoded by the vaccine. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine dose level and dosing volume (ie,1x1011vp, as a 1-mL injection) applied in the 2 pivotal nonclinical safet y studies is 2-fold above the human dose level (ie, 5x1010vp, as a 0.5- mL injection), hence the full human dose was covered. In addition, the number of Ad26.COV2.S doses administered in these studies (ie, 3 doses administered with a 14-day interval period between injections) exceeds the single -dose vaccine regimen as proposed in humans. In nonclinical vaccine efficacy studies, VAED and VAERD weremonitored after SARS -CoV -2 challenge of vaccinated NHP Syrian hamsters . Clinical signs , viral load,and histopatholog y scores of respiratory tract tissues were determined in challenged animals to assess a theoretical risk of enhanced disease . Furthermore, immunogenicity was assessed in NHP , Syrian hamster s, mice, and rabbits to show induction of neutralizing antibodies a nd/or a Th1-polarized immune response; factors that are thought to minimize the occurrence o fVAERD. Additional nonclinical studies were performed to gain insights into potential mechanisms of (vaccine -induced ) TTS. The studies addressed several hypotheses forthe pathogenesis of TTS. The results obtained from these studies may separately or in combination also have relevance for the understanding of the pathogenesis of vaccine -associated thrombocy topenia, including ITP, and/or VTE. Key findings from these nonclinical studies are presented in the table below.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 13Key Safety Findings Relevance to Human Usage Toxicity Single & repeat -dose toxicity and local tolerance A single -dose toxicity study with Ad26.COV2.S was not conducted. Possible signs of acute toxicity were monitored following the first vaccination in the GLP combined repeat -dose toxicity and local tolerance study with Ad26.COV2.S in rabbits .In this study , IM administration of Ad26.COV2.S at 1x1011vp/dose on 3 occasions with a 14 -day interval period between injections was well tolerated. The observed changes were related to a normal, anticipated, (local and systemic) immunologic response to vaccination and consisted clinically of (rare) transient local injection site dermal reactions, with transient minimal hyperthermia and minimal body weight loss or lower body weight gain after injection. This was associated with a transient (acute phase/immune) response in clinical pathology parameters, characterized by increases in plasma proteins (C -reactive protein, fibrinogen, and globulins) and white blood cell counts (monocytes and lymphocytes). Microscopic pathology findings of minimal to slight inflammation and hemorrhage were observed at the injection sites, along with increased lymphoid cellularity of germinal centers in popliteal and iliac lymph nodes and the spleen, which is consistent with an immune response to the vaccine administration. Overall, the findings were considered non - adverse and were partially or completely reversible after a 3-week treatment -free period. There were no signs suggestive of an increased risk for thromboembolic events or coagulopathies. All vaccinated animals developed an antibody response against th e SARS- CoV -2 S protein, confirm ing responsiveness of the rabbits to the vaccine.The combined repeat -dose toxicity and local tolerance study with Ad26.COV2.S did not indicate any adverse vaccine - related effects. All vaccine- related effects noted were considered to reflect a normal, immunologic response to the vaccine. There were no findings observed that would raise a specific safety concern for the use of Ad26.COV2.S in humans. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine dose level and dosing volume applied in the combined repeat -dose toxicity and local tolerance study with Ad26.COV2.S (ie, 1x1011vp, as a 1- mL injection) is 2 -fold above the human dose level (5x1010vp, as a 0.5 -mL injection), hence the full human dose was covered. In addition, the number of Ad26.COV2.S doses administered (ie, 3doses admin istered with a 14- day interval period between injections) exceeds the single -dose vaccine regimen as proposed in humans. Reproductive toxicity In the EF -PPND toxicity study in female rabbits, administration of Ad26.COV2.S at 1x1011vp during the premating (ie, 7 days prior to mating) and gestation period (ie, Day 6 and Day 20 of gestation) did not reveal any vaccine -related adverse effects on reproductive performance, fertility, ovarian and uterine examinations, or parturition. In addition, the repeat -dose toxicity and local tolerance study with Ad26.COV2.S did not reveal any effect on male sex organs that would impair male fertility.The available toxicity studies with Ad26.COV2.S do not indicate any harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity or fertility. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine dos e level and dos ingvolume applied in the EF-PPND toxicity study (ie, 1x1011vp, as a 1 -mL injection) is 2 -fold above the human dose level (ie, 5x1010vp, as a 0.5-mL injection), hence the full human dose was covered.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 14Key Safety Findings Relevance to Human Usage Developmental toxicity In the EF -PPND toxicity study in female rabbits, there was no adverse effect of vaccination on fetal body weights, external, visceral ,and skeletal evaluations, or on postnatal development of the offspring. The parental females as well as their fetuses and offspring exhibited SARS -CoV -2 S protein -specific antibody titers, indicating that maternal antibodies were transferred to the fetuses during gestation.The EF -PPND toxicity study with Ad26.COV2.S does not indicate any harmful effects with respect to embryofetal or postnatal development. The data indicate that maternal antibodies were transferred to the fetuses. This profile is expected to be similar in humans. The clinical significance of maternal antibody transfer to the fetus is unknown. Genotoxicity In accordance with the WHO Guidelines on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005), no genotoxicity studies were performed for Ad 26.COV2.S. Adenoviral vectors are classified as nonintegrating because they lack the machinery to integrate their genome into the host chromosomes (EMA 2006, FDA 2020 ). As such, although adenoviral vector DNA is transferred to the nucleus of transduced cel ls, these vectors do not have the propensity to modify the host genome, hence reducing the risk of insertional mutagenesis (Feuerbach 1996, Lee 2017) .Ad26.COV2.S is not expected to be genotoxic in humans. Carcinogenicity In accordance with the WHO Gui delines on n onclinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005), no carcinogenicity testing was performed for Ad26.COV2.S.Ad26.COV2.S is not expected to be carcinogenic in humans. Juvenile toxicity Studies in juvenile animals were not performed. There were no findings in the available (conventional) toxicity studies that would indicate a specific concern for the use of the vaccine in infants/children. Safety pharmacology Safety pharmacology studies have not been conducted. Data from the repeat -dose toxicity study (which included detailed clinical observations) do not suggest that Ad26.COV2.S affect sphysiological functions (eg, central nervous system, respiratory, and cardiovascular functions) other than those of the immune system.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 15Key Safety Findings Relevance to Human Usage Other toxicity -related in formation or data Biodistribution Nonclinical biodistribution studies in NZW rabbits showed a limited distribution profile of the Ad26 vector following IM injection. In addition, clearance of the vector was observed within 90 to 180 days, reflected by a downward trend in the number of positive tissues and vector copies over time, to levels close to or below the detect ionlimit. In addition, immunohistochemical evaluation showed the presence of S protein, with a similar distribution of S1 and S2 subunit s, in the administration site and draining lymph node 1 day after IM injection of Ad26.COV2.S in NZW rabbits. Eleven days after injection, the S protein was no longer detectable in any of the examined tissues.Ad26.COV2.S is neither expected to distribute widely, nor to replicate and/or persist in the tissues following IM injection. Vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease Immunization with Ad26.COV2.S induced neutralizing antibody responses in all species tested (mice, rabbits, Syrian hamsters, and NHP) and elicited a Th1- polarized immune response in mice and NHP. Induction of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1 -polarized immune response were confirmed i n clinical study samples (Sadoff 2021, Stephenson 2021).The available nonclinical data do not indicate any risk related to possible VAERD in humans. In Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated and SARS -CoV -2 challenged NHP, no clinical or histopathological evidence of VAE RD or VAED was observed at any vaccine dose level or for any vaccine regimen given, including animals with suboptimal immune responses that failed to protect against breakthrough SARS -CoV -2 infection. In Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated and SARS -CoV -2 challenged Syrian hamsters, no increased lung histopathology, viral load, or body weight loss was observed compared with the control group after SARS -CoV -2 challenge, including vaccinated animals showing breakthrough infection in the lung, indicating the absence of any signs of VAERD or VAED. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome Presence of high levels of anti -PF4 antibodies appears to be a central mechanistic aspect of TTS pathogenesis. A possible interaction between PF4 and Ad26.COV2.S that has been hypothesized to lead to induction of anti- PF4 antibodies has been assessed using 3 biophysical techniques: dynamic light scattering BLI experiments, no direct interactions between PF4 and Ad26.COV2.S were observed. SPR data demonstrated that the induced binding of PF4 to Ad26.COV2.S as published by Baker et al. (Baker 2021) is The available (mechanistic) nonclinical data generated with Ad26.COV2.S do not allow to conclude on the potential mechanism of TTS.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 16Key Safety Findings Relevance to Human Usage likely an experimental artefact. These findings are in line with findings of Michalik et al. (Michalik 2022) using DLS, showing no complex formation of PF4 with Ad26.COV2.S. Therefore, it is unlikely that binding of Ad26 -vector particles to PF4 is driving the etiology of TTS. Characterization of the host cell protein ( HCP )content and an overall safety assessment of the residual HCP identified in Ad26.COV2.S when produced from PER.C6 TetR cells, has shown that Ad26.COV2.S vaccine contains only trace levels of HCP and host cell DNA. HCP levels were significantly below levels of residual HCP reported for other commercial vaccines that are also produced on human cells. In the assessment of product quality attributes, no discrepancy regarding release and charact erization data was found in Ad26.COV2.S vaccine batches associated with reported TTS case(s) compared with batches currently on the market with which no cases of TTS were reported. These data suggest that HCP , host cell DNA, any potential impurities and/or excipients of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine are not likely a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of TTS . An analysis of sequence homologies of the Ad26 Capsid proteins, TetR protein, and the SARS -CoV -2 S protein vaccine antigen with the human proteome and 4 sel ected human proteins potentially associated with TTS was performed and revealed only limited linear homologies. Linear epitope homology is unlikely to be the root cause to TTS. RNA sequencing of Ad26.COV2.S transduced cells in vitro to assess alternative s plicing events leading to C -terminally truncated, soluble S protein variants was performed. No or very low frequency of aberrant splicing events were found that would affect the spike transgene encoded by Ad26.COV2.S, making it unlikely to contribute to TT S. Expression of S protein was assessed in the IM administration site, draining lymph nodes, and spleen by immunohistochemistry and in the blood by S -PLEX assay, on Days 1 and 11 following IM dosing in rabbits. Atransient expression of the S protein was o bserved in the IM administration site, draining lymph nodes (iliac and/or popliteal), and blood on Day 1 , with all tissues examined being negative for S protein expression on Day 11 post dosing. No adverse vaccine -related effects were noted. Overall, Ad26. COV2.S -induced S protein expression, including its bioavailability in blood, was not associated with a safety concern in this study, but does not allow S protein to be ruled out as a potential contributing factor in a multifactorial scenario of TTS inducti on following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in humans .JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 17Key Safety Findings Relevance to Human Usage Vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S did not induce hPF4 binding antibodies in NHP and rabbits. In mice, hPF4 binding antibody responses were induced, however, responses were also seen with non -adeno -based vacci nes not including or encoding the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen (eg,marketed influenza vaccine), hence indicative of an unspecific immune activation. In rabbits, IV administration of Ad26.COV2.S did not induce any additional changes in safety parameters, nor chang es which were more pronounced to what was observed after IM administration of the same vaccine dose level (based on an evaluation of eg, clinical chemistry, coagulation and hematology endpoints including platelet counts, as well as S protein and Ad26 vecto r DNA distribution in the blood). Overall, a single dose IV administration of Ad26.COV2.S was well tolerated and did not induce any relevant changes in platelets, prothrombin time, or APTT clotting times, or gross or histopathological changes related to th rombosis, thromboembolic disease, or their sequelae. Although based on a limited number of animals, these data indicate that an accidental IV injection of Ad26.COV2.S may not represent an increased risk of TTS.

Brief Overview of Development The current clinical development plan of Ad26.COV2.S aims to develop a vaccine for the prevention of COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 in adults. In the course of the clinical developm ent, different dose (single dose with or without a second/ booster dose2), and intervals between doses (2to 6months) are being assessed .The current clinical development plan includes 11Company -sponsored interventional trials, includ ing 5 trials that provide information on the efficacy and/or safety of booster doses for Ad26.COV2.S (ie, 5x1010vp)(COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, COV2008, and COV3009). At the of EU-RMP, a ll studies (except COV1002, COV1003 ,and COV2001) . The first-in-human Phase 1/2a trial COV 1001 performs an initial evaluation of the safet y and immunogenicit y of Ad26.COV2.S. This trial assesses the preselected 5x1010vp and 1x1011vp dose levels, both administered as a 1 -dose and a 2 -dose regimen in adults aged 18 to 55 years and 65 y ears. A Phase 1 trial COV 1002 wasconducted in Japan, in parallel with trial COV 1001, to evaluate the safet y and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S administered as a 2-dose regimen (5x1010vp, 1x1011vp)in Japanese adults aged 20 to 55 years and 65years. A Phase 1 trial COV1003 wasconducted to compare the safet y and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S at a single dose of 5x1010vp in 2 different volumes (0.3 mL or 0.5 mL) in healthy adults aged 18 to 65 y ears. A Phase 2a trial COV 2001 in adults aged 18 to 55 years and 65 yearsevaluate dthe safet y 56-and 84-day vaccination intervals for the 2-dose regimen (5x1010vp). The trial also evaluate dthe safet y and immunogenicit y of Ad26 .COV2.S inhealthy adolescents aged 16 and 17 years, ata single dose of 2.5x1010vp. A Phase 2 trial COV2004 evaluates the safet y and immunogenicit y of Ad26.COV2.S in health y pregnant participants aged 18 to 45 years, after a single dose of 5x1010vp or 2 doses at 2.5x1010vp. A Phase 2 trial COV2008 in adults aged 18 years and older who have previously received vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S or BNT162b2 evaluates the safet y and immunogenicit y of 2In this document ,the terms \"booster\" and \"secon d dose\" are used interchangeably for participants who received a second dose of Ad26.COV2.S. As all participants had shown a response (both in ELISA and functional antibodies) after the first dose, and all showed a rapid rise of antibodies within a week af ter administration of the second dose, the second dose is effectively a booster.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 19Ad26.COV2.S administered as booster vaccination (5x1010vp, 2.5x1010vp, 1x1010vp), 6 months after the primary vaccination . A Phase 3 trial COV3003 in adults aged 18 to 55 years evaluates 6 dose levels (range: 1.25x1010vp -9x1010vp) of Ad26.COV2.S administered as a 2 trials COV 3001 (ENSEMBLE) , safet y, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in adults aged 18 to 59 years and 60 years , after administration of a single dose of study vaccine (COV 3001) or 2 doses of study vaccine with an interval of 56days (COV 3009). Interim results from trial COV1001 led to the selection of the 5x1010vp dose level for evaluation in these Phase 3 trials. A Phase 3 trial COV3005 evaluates the safety and immunogenicit y of Ad26.COV2.S co- administered with a n influenza vaccine in adults aged 18 y ears and older. All above clinical trials are randomized, placebo -controlled, and conducted in a double -blind for COV1003 which wasa randomized, group trial without placebo control , COV2004 which is an open -label , and COV3005 which arenot placebo- controlled .During the course of the clinical development program, the placebo- controlled trials COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, COV3001, and COV3009 were unblinded and participants in the Placebo group were offered a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (except for trial COV1002) . The trials were continued in an open -label manner. In addition, the trial COV3001 protocol has been amended to offer all participants a booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Long-term safety follow -up post-booster will continue for 1 year in COV3001 and at least 6 months in COV3009. If a booster dose was required, other trial protocols were also amended to allow administration of a booster, either with Ad26.COV2.S or with another COVID - 19 vaccine according to local recommendations. A Phase 3b study COV3012 (Sisonke -1[Together]) is a non -Company sponsored open -label, single -arm vaccine implementation study that monitors vaccine effectiveness and safet yof a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S among healthcare workers aged 18 years in South Africa. This study is sponsored b y the South African Medical Research Council and is currently ongoing .The Sisonke study was expanded to include an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose 6 to 9 months after the initial vaccination in healthcare workers (ie, study COV3021 [Sisonke -2/Sisonke Boost ]). A Phase 2trial COV3006 evaluates safet yand immunogenicity of different dose levels of Ad26.COV2.S administered as a 1 -or 2-dose regimen in healthy adolescents from 12 to 17 y ears inclusive.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 20SIII.2. Clinical Trial Exposure Company -sponsored C linical Trials The clinical trial exposure and safety data shown in this EU-RMP arebased upon the pooled analysesof several Company -sponsored clinical trials . Three sets of pooled data are presented in this EU-RMP , ie, the primary pooling ,the cross -dose level pooling, and the extended cross- dose level pooling . 1) Primary Pooling The primary pooling served as the primary source for determining the safety and reactogenicit y profile of Ad26.COV2.S in a randomized, double -blind , placebo -controlled manner. Data from the following 5 trials were used for characterization of exposure and safet y up tothe cut-off dates for interim or primary anal yses of the individual trials (02 August 2021 at the latest ): 1 Phase 1/2a trial: data ) Phase 2a trial: COV3001 (unblinded data) and COV3009 (unblinded data) The primary pooling include sexposure and safety data of Ad26.COV2.S at the approved dose level (5x1010vp), in adults aged 18 years. This pooling includes data from the double -blind phase of the above -mentioned double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled trials and includes primary vaccination and homologous boosting with Ad26.COV2.S . Data from participants who received another COVID -19vaccine outside the study were excluded from the analy sis from the date of the other vaccination onwards . The dataset used for the primary pooling safety analyses is the Full Anal ysis Set (FAS), which includes all participants with at least 1 documented vaccine (placebo or Ad26.COV2.S) administration, regardless of the occurrence of protocol deviations. 2) Cross -dose Level Pooling Data of the cross -dose level pooling complements the findings of the primary pooling, providing extended data beyondthe primary pooling cut -off dates , and supports risk chara cterization for risk management planning based on the current safety knowledge .The cross -dose level pooling includes clinical trial data that is not placebo -controlled and also groups for which the sequence of vaccination is not taken into account (mixed schedules) .JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26.COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G -HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 21Data from the following 10 trials were used for characterization of exposure and safet y up to the cut-off date of24 February 2022 : 1 Phase 1/2 a trial: COV1001 unblinded data ) 2 Phase (un blinded data) COV1003 ( 2a COV3009 unblinded data) Thecross-dose level pooling includes exposure and safet y dataofAd26.COV2.S at any dose level (ranging from 1x1010vpto1x1011vp), in adults aged 18 years .This pooling includes primary vaccination , as well ashomologous boost er andmixed schedules (encompassing a number of booster regimens of different COVID -19 vaccines, eg, Ad26.COV2.S followed by an mRNA vaccine ). Data from participants who received another COVID -19 vaccine outside the study were included inthe analysis ofthis pooling. Exposu re data is presented by each Ad26.COV2.S dose level individually as well as for all dose levels combined. The dataset used for the cross -dose level pooling safet y analyses is the FAS, which includes all participants with at least 1 documented vaccine (placebo , Ad26.COV2.S either alone or as part of a mixed schedule with another COVID -19 vaccine) administration, regardless of the occurrence of protocol deviations. 3) Extended Cross -dose Level Pooling Additional pooled clinical trial data are included for the im portant identified risk 'myocarditis and pericarditis'.

Considered to be included as missing information: No Rationale (if not included as missing information)Ad26.COV2.S is a nonreplicating vaccine, therefore, there is no risk of infection leading to potential adverse clinical outcomes and the safety profile is not expected to be significantly different than in the general population. Recent studies suggest that patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection have an incre ased risk for morbidity and mortality from COVID -19(Mirzaie 2021) . Based on this assessment, it is considered that the potential benefit greatly outweighs the risk of vaccinating individuals infection.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Plan 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 32SIV.2.

Use in pediatrics is not considered missing information as it is not in scope of the indication. Use in elderl y The risk for severe illness with COVI D-19 increases with age, with elderl y being at highest risk. The primary pooling included 13,259 (3 4.4%) participants aged 60 years, 7,392 (1 9.2%)participants aged 65years, and 1,280 (3.3 %) participants aged 75years who received Ad26.COV2.S.

On 16December 2021 , the European Commission authorized (as part of the conditional Marketing Authorisation) Ad26.COV2.S as homologous or heterologous booster followi ng completion of primary vaccination with an approved mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. On 11November 2022, the European Commission authorized (as part of the conditional Marketing Authorisation) Ad26.COV2.S as heterologous booster following completion of primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector -based COVID -19 vaccine. On 09January 2023, the European Commission converted the conditional marketing authorization for the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine into a standard marketing authorization. Post-authorisation exposure in the European Union/EEA and worldwide from launch up to 28 February 20234ispresented below. SV.1.1. Method used to Calculate Exposure Post-authorisation exposure in the European Union/EEA is based on the number of administered doses reported on the ECDC COVID -19Vaccine Tracker website (ECDC 2023b). Estimates of worldwide post-authorisation exposure are based upon the number of administered doses reported from CDC for the US(CDC 2023 ), ECDC for EEA countries, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency for South Korea (KDCA 2023),Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade for Brazil (Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade 2021) , and National Department of Health for South Africa (NDH 202 3). The vaccine exposure figures described in this section are an overall estimation with some uncertainties regarding the lack of exposure information received from many countries. SV.1.2. Exposure European Union/EEA Cumulative postmarketing exposure from the European Union/EEA according to the ECDC as of 28 February 2023 , is a total of 19,781,050 primary doses of Ad26.COV2.S.

The vaccine construct and the formulation. Ad26.COV2.S is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication -incompetent human Ad26 vector that encodes a SARS -CoV -2 full length S protein in a stabilized conformation. The S protein on the surface of SARS- CoV -2 binds to the ACE2 receptor of a host cell,allowing the virus to infect the cell. Vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S leads to humoral and cellular immune responses directed against the S protein. The production of neutralizing and other functional S-specific antibodies may block binding of the viral S protein to the ACE2 receptor, thereby inhibiting viral entry into host cells, and mediate cellular effector mechanisms via Fc function, leading to clearance of SARS -CoV -2 virus particles and infected cells. Cellular immune responses may further contribute to protection by clearing SARS -CoV -2-infected cells via cytotoxic mechanisms. Ad26.COV2.S is produced in TetR cells. The non- pathogenicity of the vector. Ad26.COV2.S is replication -incompetent as it only encodes the S protein of SARS -CoV -2 and is not capable of replicating in human cells. As such, it is not capable of causing infection/disease. The vaccine does not contain an adjuvant. SVII.1.

The reactogenicity profile does not impact the overall safet y profile of the vaccine and is not proposed to be included in the list of safety concerns, rather it is discussed for completeness here. Frequencies were calculated based on the Safet y Subset of trial COV3001 (primary analysis). The most common local adverse reaction reported was injection site pain (48.6%). The most common systemic adverse reactions were headache (38.9%) ,fatigue (38.2%) ,myalgia (33.2%) ,and nausea (14.2%) .Pyrexia (defined as body temperature 38\u00b0C) was observed in 9% of participants.

The frequencies of solicited local and systemic AEs were analy zed by age (18 to <60 years and 60years), comorbidities, and SARS -CoV -2 serostatus at baseline . Asummary of the results is presented below. Overall, no clinicall y relevant differences in the reactogenicity profile of Ad26.COV2.S were observed across comorbidities andSARS -CoV -2 serostatus at baseline. The frequency of solicited local and systemic AEs was lower in participants aged 60yearscompared to participants aged 18 to <60years. No overall differences in safet y were observed between older adults 65 years and 75 years of age and younger adults ( 18 to <60years of age). Furthermore, participants with one or more comorbidity (ie, asthma, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney diseas e, COPD, serious heart conditions, hypertension, and obesity) at baseline had higher frequencies of solicited AEs in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to placebo. Solicited Local Adverse Events In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the frequency of solicited local AEs was lower in participants aged 60years compared to participants aged 18 to <60years. In general, this lower frequency was reported for all selected solicited local AEs, including the most frequent solicited local AE, ie,vaccination site pain (33.3% of participants aged 60years compared to 58.6% of participants aged 18 to <60 years). In general, no clinically relevant differences in the frequency of solicited local AEs were observed in participants with one or more comorbidities compared to participants without comorbidities after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. The most frequent solicited local AE, ie, vaccination site pain, was reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group with a lower frequency in participants with one or more comorbidities co mpared to those without comorbidities (40.9% versus 52.7%). I n general, a similar frequency for all other selected solicited local AEs was reported in participants with and without comorbidities. The frequency of solicited local AEs was similar in particip ants who were seronegative for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline compared to participants who were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline (50.1% and 54.5%, respectively ) in the Ad26.COV2.S group. In the Ad26.COV2.S group, no clinicall y relevant differences in median duration and the median time to onset for solicited local AEs were reported within the subgroups b y age (18 to <60 years and 60 years), comorbidities, and SARS -CoV -2 serostatus at baseline. Median duration and median time to onset never exceeded 3 day s in any of these subgroups. Solicited Systemic Adverse Events In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the overall frequency of solicited systemic AEs was lower in participants aged 60years compared to participants aged 18 to <60 years. In general, this lower frequency in participants aged 60years was reported for all selected solicited systemic AEs, including the most frequent solicited systemic AE, ie, headache (30.5% of participants aged 60years compared to 44.5% of 18 to <60 years).JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 44Pyrexia (fever defined as body temperature 38.0\u00b0C, as recorded by the participants) was reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group in 3.1% of participants aged 60years compared to 12.8% of participants aged 18 to <60years. Grade 3 pyrexia was reported in 1 (0.1%) partic ipant aged 60years (67 years of age) compared to 7 (0.3%) participants aged 18 to <60 years (all <35 years of age). No clinicall y relevant differences in the frequency of solicited s ystemic AEs were observed i n the Ad26.COV2.S group in participants with one or more comorbidities (49.6%) compared to participants without comorbidities (58.1%) and in participants who were seronegative for SARS -CoV -2at baseline (55.4%) compared to participants who were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2at baseline (50.6%). In theAd26.COV2.S group, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the median duration and median time to onset for solicited systemic AEs, with specifically pyrexia being similar across subgroups by age (18 to <60 years and 60 years), comorbidities, and SARS -CoV -2 serostatus at baseline. Per protocol, prophy lactic antipy retic use was not encouraged. However, antipyretics were recommended post-vaccination for symptom relief as needed and were used more frequentl y in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to the Placebo group . Of the 302 participants who experienced pyrexia in the Ad26.COV2.S group, 202 (66.9%) used antipy retics. Overall, in the FAS, 1,128/21,895 (5.2%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group used analgesics or antipyretics up to 7 days post -vaccination. Anxiety- related reactions Individuals can react in anticipation of, or as a result of ,an injection of any kind. These reactions are not related to the vaccine, but to fear of the injection (WHO 2019). The most common manifestations of anxiety -related reactions to immunization are: Fainting (syncope and presy ncope ): the most commonly reported anxiety -related reaction, especiall y in older children, adolescents ,and older adults. It does not require any additional measures other than t oprevent injury from fainting . Hyperventilation: increased breathing rate may cause dizziness and tingling sensation. It will typicall y recede shortl y after vaccination has been completed. Vomiting: more commonly observed in children, typicall y following extended periods of crying and apnea. Regular measures to avoid broncho -aspiration are sufficient. Convulsions: might occur in very rare instances, especially in children and in adolescents, and it may be accompanied by fainting. The individual should recover without any sequelae. As stated in the SmPC Section 4.4, anxiety -related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), h yperventilation, or stress related reactions, may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection . It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 45Anxiety -related reactions are not considered an important potential risk as they do not require further characterization by additional pharmacovigilance activities, orrisk minimization beyond standard clinical practice. The routine risk minimization measures included in the SmPC and PL are part of standard clinical practice for vaccines in general and are considered sufficient for purposes of risk communication. Exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders (ie, asthma and COPD) An increased risk for severe COVID -19 outcomes has been reported in individuals with chronic lung diseases including COPD (Schultze 2020). Asthma patients are also at an increased risk for severe COVID -19; however, the disease burden in these patients is less evident for SARS -CoV -2 compared to influenza and other viruses (Izquierdo 2021). Therefore, these populations are a priority for vaccination against COVID-19. Vaccines against other respiratory diseases, including influenza, have been associated with exacerbations of both asthma and COPD (Duffy 2017). Two possible mechanistic pathway s have been proposed: viral infection (ie, lack of efficacy ) and IgE hypersensitivity . Evidence for such association, however, remains weak (Committee to Review Adverse Effects of Vaccines; Institute of Medicine 2012). A numerical imbalance has been observed in trial COV3001 regarding exacerbations of asthma and COPD in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to placebo (8 versus 1). The median time to onset was 11days after vaccination. A single event was reported as serious (exacerbation of COPD), which occurred 39 days after vaccination. All events were assessed as not related b y the investigator and were recovered at the time of reporting. Despite the numerical imbalance in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus placebo, a causal link cannot be established based on the currentl y available data. All reported events occurred later than 72hours after vaccination, which does not support a causal mechanism of reactive airway disease due to vaccine hypersensitivity . In addition, the onset of these episodes could have been confounded by other triggers such as infection. Since patients with asthma and COPD are at an increased risk for severe COVI D-19 outcomes, exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders is considered a risk but not a safet y concern. Immunization error s Large -scale public health approaches for mass vaccination may represent changes to the standard vaccine treatment process, thereby potentiall y introducing the risk of immunization errors related to administration, vaccination scheme, storage conditions, errors associated with a multidose vial, and confusion with other COVID -19 vaccines.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 46Anticipated undesirable clinical outcomes arising from immunization errors include: Insufficient immunogenicity of the vaccine(s) in case of 'failure to vaccinate' (due to immunization error) leading to lack of anticipated clinical benefit (related to efficacy ). Increased reactogenicit y in case of overdosing (due to the use of multidose vial). Higher doses (up to 2-fold, ie, 1x1011vp) administered in Phase 1/2trials w erewell tolerated, but an increased reactogenicit ywasreported . Other potential undesirable clinical outcomes of immunization error s are unknown. Immunization error sare not expected to result in any safety concerns . Any AE arising as a consequence of an immunization error will be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance activities and will be presented in each PBRER/ PSUR . At the time of initial cMAA submission, the Company considered the following situations as potential sources of immunization errors: As the majorit y of other COVID -19 vaccine regimens are administered as a 2-dose schedule , there is a possibility for Ad26.COV2.S to be erroneously administered twice. As multidose vials (>5 mL) will be used for vaccination , there is the possibility of administering a higher dose than the selected dose level of 5x1010vp of Ad26.COV2.S . Ad26.C OV2.S is indicated in individuals aged 18 years. As the indication of other manufacturer's COVID -19 vaccines includes the use in adolescents aged 16 and 17years, there is a risk for Ad26.COV2.S being erroneously administered in this age group. Currently , no safet y data exist regarding the use of Ad26.COV2.S in combination with any other COVID -19 vaccine as part of a mixed schedule. There is a risk for the vaccine unwittingly being administered to an individual alread y vaccinated with another COVID -19 vaccine or vice versa. Potential immunization errors are mitigated through the information in the SmPC Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 6.6, which contain instructions regarding the therapeutic indication, posology , method of administration, and storage conditions of Ad26.COV2.S. In addition, a Janssen COVID -19 vaccine -specific Contact Center will be available to support vaccination providers (eg, healthcare professionals and individuals who administer the vaccine) and recipients by providing a straightforward and streamlined way for them to ask unsolicited requests for medical information. These available resources will provide information on the proper preparation and administration of the vaccine and reduce the potential for immunization error sin the context of a mass vaccination campaign.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 47List of AE SIs There were no pre-specified AESI s for Ad26.COV2.S early clinical development. The Company follows a dy namic medical review of incoming SAEs to identify potential safet y issues. For the purpose of the EU-RMP and monthly summary safety reports, a set of AESI s has been identified taking into consideration the available lists of AESIs from the following expert groups and regulatory authorities: Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC) (Law 2020) ACCESS protocol (2020) US CDC ( preliminary list of AESI for VAERS surveillance) (Shimabukuro 2020) MHRA (unpublished guideline) These AESIs are taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. The list is considered dynamic and may be customized following the evolving safety profile of the vaccine. Medical conditions covered by the list of AESI s include: Immune -mediated and thromboembolic events . Major organ disorders, including neurological, cardiovascular, he patic, and respiratory . Events associated with COVID -19.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 48SVII.1.2. Risks C onsidered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP Safety Concerns for Inclusion in the RMPRisk -Benefit Impact Important identified risks Anaphylaxis Allergic reactions, including possibly severe reactions (eg, hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis), are known to occur with any injectable vaccine. Most individuals fully recover with treatment, but serious complications can occur. Reporting from selected healthcare organizations in the United States found an overall rate of anaphylaxis after vaccination of 1.3 cases per million doses administered to both children and adults. The estimated rate of anaphylaxis reported to VAERS from 1990 to 2016 was 0.6 per 1 million doses distributed after measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and 0.2 per 1 million doses distributed after pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; from 2006 to 2016, the estimated rate was 1.2 per 1 million doses distributed after varicella va ccine. From 2010 to 2016, the median estimated annual rate after influenza vaccine (all types) among persons aged 1 to 84 years was 0.2 (range: 0.1- 0.4) per 1 million doses administered (Su 2019). Available data seem to suggest a particular patient profile for individuals who experience anaphylaxis after vaccination: the vast majority has a history of atopy (history of atopic disease, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, or food or drug allergy) but anaphylaxis can occur among individuals w ith no known history of hypersensitivity. Ad26.COV2.S contains ingredients with known potential to cause allergic reactions, including polysorbate 80. Important potential risks Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine- associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD)VAERD was first seen in the 1960s in infants with RSV infection after receiving a vaccine against RSV that led to markedly worse respiratory disease as compared to non -vaccinated infants. Subsequently, reports of VAED w ere reported in individuals without prior exposure to Dengue who received tetravalent Dengue vaccines. Nonclinical experience with SARS -CoV -and MERS CoV -based vaccines also indicated a risk for VAERD, however, this risk could not be confirmed in humans du e to the lack of efficacy studies. For candidate SARS -CoV -2 vaccines, no evidence of VAED or VAERD after IM immunization has been reported to date in nonclinical studies or clinical trials. Nevertheless, in the absence of long -term safety and efficacy data , the evidence is not yet sufficient to fully dismiss VAED, including VAERD as a safety concern, and it remains an important potential risk. If VAED, including VAERD was to be identified as a true risk, depending on its incidence and severity, it could neg atively impact the overall risk -benefit certain individuals.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 49Safety Concerns for Inclusion in the RMPRisk -Benefit Impact Venous thromboembolism Natural infection with SARS -CoV- 2 has shown to be associated with hypercoagulability, pulmonary intravascular coagulation, microangiopathy, and occurrence thrombotic and thromboembolic events in context of COVID -19 is associated with a poor outcome. The hypercoagulable state observed in patients with severe COVID -19 is thought to be related to the high -grade systemic inflammatory response, although other mechanisms such as the higher incidence of severe COVID -19 in individuals with risk factors for thrombotic and thromboembolic events have been proposed. It is unknown whether these proposed mechanisms linking COVI D-19 and thromboembolic events could also be applicable for vaccines against COVID -19. The available evidence from the clinical trial development program does not suggest that VTE is an important identified risk in participants vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S. Nevertheless, due to the observed numerical imbalance and its potential life -threatening nature, the risk of VTE resulting from vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, especially in participants with comorbidities associated with DVT and PE, cannot be entirely rule d out. Therefore, venous thromboembolism is considered an important potential risk. Missing information Use in pregnancy and while breastfeedingAs being pregnant or planning to become pregnant is an exclusion criterion in all clinical trials being conducted to date, the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S in pregnant women has not been established and the risk in this population has not yet been defined . Breastfeeding women were excluded from all clinical trials, except from Phase 3 trials COV3001 and COV3009. Up to the DLP of the EU -RMP that was part of the initial cMAA submission ( 22 January 2021), 128breastfeeding women have received Ad26.COV2.S in trial COV3001, but no data are currently available from these trials in this subpopulation. Therefore, the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S in breastfeeding women has not been established and the risk in this population has not yet been defined. Use in immun ocompromised patientsThe safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S is not known in immunocompromised patients, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy, due to their exclusion from the clinical development program. Only individuals with a stable/well -contr olled HIV infection, those receiving chronic low -dose (less than 20 mg of prednisone or equivalent) immunosuppressive therapy were included in trials COV3001 and COV3009. Given the fact that Ad26.COV2.S is a replication -incompetent vaccine, the safety prof ile of Ad26.COV2.S when used in immunocompromised individuals is not expected to differ from that in the general population, with no specific safety concerns.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 50Safety Concerns for Inclusion in the RMPRisk -Benefit Impact Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disordersThere is limited information on the safety of Ad26.COV2.S in individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders and a theoretical concern that the vaccine may exacerbate their underlying disease. Use in frail patients with comorbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders)There is limited information on the safety of Ad26.COV2.S in frail patients with comorbidities. These comorbidities may compromise their immune response and the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S in this subpopulation could vary from that seen in healthy adults, with a potentially higher risk of severe COVID -19. Interaction with other vaccinesAd26.COV2.S will be used in individuals who may also receive other vaccines. Trials to determine if conc omitant administration of Ad26.COV2.S with other vaccines may affect the efficacy or safety of either vaccine have not been performed. This applies also to mixed schedules with other COVID -19 vaccines. Long- term safety There are no available data on the l ong-term safety of Ad26.COV2.S. Further data are being collected for at least 2 years in ongoing trials COV3001 and COV3009 following administration of Ad26.COV2.S, and for up to 1 year in studies COV4003 and COV4001. Based on long -term safety data from ot her Ad26- based vaccines (at least 6months up to 4.5 years post -vaccination in clinical trials), no long -term safety issues have been identified (Adenoviral Vaccine Safety Database V5.0 2020).

SVII.3.1. Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks Important Identified Risk: Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome Potential Mechanisms: The exact mechanism of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S is unknown. Several hypothetical biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathophy siology of vaccine -induced TTS, including vaccine - mediated induction of platelet antibodies (Greinacher 2021) . The MAH assessed a possible interaction between PF4 and Ad26.COV2.S (for details see Module SII)and does not have conclusive evidence for binding of Ad26.COV2.S to PF4 invitro. However, several research teams in the TTS field are pursuing to investigate the potential binding of different Adenovirus vectors or other components in the formulation of the COVID -19vaccines to PF4. The MAH will continue to follow the research developments regarding the potential binding to PF4 and support those activities wherever possible. Besides the adenovirus vector , a potential role of a predisposition of the patient as well as of the Sprotein should be considered. The SARS -CoV -2 S protei nhas been associated with endothelial and hy pothesized to be related to adverse effects af ter COVID -19 vaccination (Trougakos 2022). PF4 binding data and a potential role of the S protein were presented by the MAH at the virtual workshop on 27 June 2022, hosted by the EMA to review the current understanding of the pathophy siology of TTS (EMA 2022c , Buoninfante 2022). With the remaining ongoing additional pharmacovigilance activities included in Part III.2, the MAH aims to further understand what the potential causes of TTS might be and to gain insights into possible anti -PF4 antibody induction in the context of post -vaccination TTS .JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 52Evidence Source(s) Evidence: Thrombosis in combination with thrombocy topenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S and is an adverse drug reaction described in the SmPC . Characterization of the Risk: A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. This includes severe cases of venous thrombosis at unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis concomitant with thrombocy topenia. Fatal outcome s have been reported. These cases occurred within the first 3 weeks following vaccination, and mostl y in individuals <60 years of age.

If participants received Ad26.COV2.S before the placebo vaccination (e.g. randomized sequence Ad26.COV2.S -Placebo), then the placebo vaccination is not reported. For these participants, time to onset of adverse events of interests (AEI) is linked to active dose received by the participant. Note: Data cutoff for COV1001 of 25JUN2021 releases classifications for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia quali fied for TTS assessment were not yet available in the database. AEs which were present in database and were later identified as 'Qualified for TTS Assessment' and classified per PRAC criteria, are presented in the table (latest classification at the time o f RMP cut -off date 24 February 2022 was used). When there is a thromboembolic event with a concurrent thrombocytopenia and/or a low platelet count (both defined as platelet count below 150,000/\u00b5L) within 42 days of the thromboembolic event, the case is l abeled as \"qualified for assessment\" and is being discussed and classified by the TTS Assessment Committee. Modified from [TSFAE1P2.RTF] [PROD/VAC31518/Z_RMP/DBR_ADHOC_JAN22/RE_ADHOC_JAN22_BLA/TSFAE1P2.SAS] 20JUL 2022, 00:48 In the primary pooling, within 28dayspost any dose, 5 cases in 4 (<0.1%) participants were qualified for TTS assessment , following Ad26.COV2.S administration. Of the 5 cases that were qualified for TTS assessment, 1case (considered related to the study vaccine by both the Comp any and the investigator) met the PRAC case definition of confirmed TTS and 3cases met possible PRAC case definition. Similar incidences were observed in the cross -dose level pooling anal ysiswithin 28 days post an y dose following Ad26.COV2.S administrat ion.

Of these cases, 192 cases met confirmed (n=27), probable (n=14), or possible (n=151) PRAC case definition. This represents a reporting rate of 3.45 spontaneous cases per million doses administered. The outcome was fatal in 33out of these 192cases . Cumulatively , from launch to 24 August 2022, a total of 6 heterologous booster dose cases received from postmarketing experience were qualified for TTS assessment. Of these cases, 1 case (forwhich primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine was followed by a booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S) met possible PRAC case definition. This represents a reporti ng rate of 0.34 spontaneous cases per million doses administered. This case had a fatal outcome. No homologous booster dose cases were reported. Risk Factors and Risk Groups: Although no clear risk factors have been identified, the cases of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia reported in the postmarketing setting more commonly occurred in individuals aged < 60 years. Preventability : TTS requires specialized clinical management. Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (eg, hematologists, specialists in coagulation) to diagnose and treat this condition (SmPC Section 4.4). The SmPC Section 4.3 states that JCOVDEN is contraindicated in individuals with a history of confirmed TTS following vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine. The SmPC Section 4.4 makes reference to this contraindication and states thathealthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocy topenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain following vaccination. Additionally , anyone with neurological symptoms including severe or persistent headaches, seizures, mental status changes, or blurred vision after vaccination, or who experiences spontaneous bleeding, skin bruising (petechia) beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention. Individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia within 3weeks after vaccination with JCOVDEN should be activel y investigated for signs of thrombosis. Similarly , individuals who present with thrombosis within 3 weeks of vaccination should be evaluated for thrombocy topenia.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 56Impact on the Risk -Benefit Balance of the Product: Thrombosis in combination with thrombocy topenia after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S is a very rare event which is potentially life-threatening, especiall y if improperl y managed. Adequate risk minimization that raises public awareness and supports education of healthcare professionals may lead to earlier diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which may improve the prognosis of TTS. Based on current information, the overall risk -benefit balance fo r Ad26.COV2.S is considered to remain positive for the indicated target populations. Public Health I mpact: The occurrence of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome is very rare following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Therefore, the impact on public health is expected to be low.

However, as with other vaccines, immune activation is believed to play a role in the development of the disease (Sejvar 2011). Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: GBS has been observed very rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S both in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting . Similar AEs have also been described following administration of other COVI D-19 vaccines.

Cumulatively , from launch to 24 August 2022, a total of 10 booster dose cases (3 homologous and 7 heterologous) of GBS meeting at least Brighton Collaboration Level 4 of diagnostic certainty have been received from postmarketing experience. This represents a reporting rate of 3.36 spontaneous cases per million doses administered. The outcome was fatal in 1 out of these 10cases. A recent large cohort study using data from the US Vaccine Safet y Datalink (VSD) showed an unadjusted incidence rate forGBS of 32.4 (95% CI: 14.8- 61.5) per 100,000 person -years (1 to 21days following Ad26.COV2.S administration ), which was significantly higher than the background rate. Theadjusted risk ratio was 6.03 (95% CI: 0.79-147.79) (1 to 21 days vs 22to 42days following Ad26.COV2.S administration). Nearl y all patients presenting GBS after Ad.26.COV2.S administration, identified in this surveillance ,had facial weakness or paral ysis, in addition to weakness and decreased reflexes in the limbs.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 60Risk Fa ctors and Risk Groups: There are no known risk factors for the development of GBS following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. Based mainly on data from North America and Europe, it has been shown in literature that the GBS incidence increased by 20% for every 10- year increase in age; GBS is usually more frequent in males, with the highest incidence between 50 to 70 years of age ( Van Doorn 2020). Preventability : The SmPC Section 4. 4states that healthcare professionals should be alert ofGBS signs and symptoms to ensure correct diagnosis, in orderto initiate adequate supportive care and treatment and to rule out other causes . Impact on the Risk -Benefit Balance of the Product: Although GBS isaserious event that has been reported following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S , it has been reported at a very low incidence and adequate risk minimization via the SmPC is considered sufficient to manage this risk. Therefore, the impact on the risk -benefit balance for the vaccine is considered to be low. Public Health I mpact: GBS associated with vaccines ty pically occurs at a low incidence, resulting in a low public health impact. Although the potential clinical consequences of GBS are serious, this is a risk known to healthcare professionals, with negligible public health impact. Annex 1 MedDRA Management Plan 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 61Important Identified Risk: Thrombocytopenia ,including immune thrombocytopenia Potential Mechanisms: The mechanistic evidence for vaccine -derived thrombocytopenia is not very well understood. It is suspected to have a strong immune component such as immunostimulation causing alterations in cytokines that abrogate giving rise cross -reactive anti-platelet antibodies (anti-IIb/IIIa) and/or activation of cytotoxic T cells that decrease platelet survival (Wise 2007). Similar to other autoimmune disorders, molecular mimicry with bacteria l or viral proteins might be one reason for the pathogenesis of immune thrombocy topenia (ITP) (Marini 2019). The SARS -CoV -2 S protein has been associated with endothelial inflammation, leukocy te adhesion, release Zheng 2021) , and is hypothesized to be related to adverse effects after COVID -19 vaccination (Trougakos 2022). Recent mechanistic studies (nonclinical studies ,and studies using clinical trialsamples )conducted by the MAH to study the pathogenesis of (vaccine -induced ) TTS with potential relevance to thrombocytopenia (including ITP),did not elucidate a clear mechanism of action for thrombocytopenia (including ITP )following Ad26.COV2.S adminis tration. Evidence Source(s) and of Cases of ITP with very low platelet levels (<20,000 per L) have been reported very rarely after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, usually within the first 4 weeks after receiving Ad26.COV2.S. This included cases with bleeding and cases with fatal outcome. Some of these cases occurred in individuals with a history of ITP. Based on the observed imbalance in postmarketing events, ITP is an adverse drug reaction described in the SmPC.

Within 28dayspost any dose, 285 events of thrombocytopenia were reported in 277 (0.4%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group ; no events of ITP, as reported by the investigator, were reported in the Ad26.COV2.s group .Thirty -two (11.2%) of the thrombocy topenia events were considered related to the study vaccine. The observed increase d frequency in events of thrombocy topenia in the Ad26.COV2.S group in the cross -dose level pooling (0.4%) compared to the primary pooling (<0.1%) ,is primaril y driven by the implementation of protocol amendments that defined the follow -up of AESIs (thrombocy topenia and/or thrombosis). After the implementation of these amendments, a prospective pre-vaccination blood sample collection for platelet count assessment was required at the time of Ad26.COV2.S (or blinded) vaccine administration .As a result, an increased rate of thrombocytopenia was observed as compared to the double -blind phase of trials where this requirement was not in place. The majorit y of these were thrombocy topenia s on the day of vaccination, suggesting some events may have had an onset pre-vaccination . No new information to further characterize this safet y concern was identified from clinical trials evaluating an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose as compared with the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S.

Risk Factors and Risk Groups: Limited data from postmarketing experience with Ad26.COV2.S, including literature, suggest that individuals with chronic or recurrent ITP may be at increased risk of developing ITP following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 64Preventability : The SmPC Section 4.4 provides guidance to healthcare professionals to be alert to signs and symptoms of thrombocytopenia and includes a caution for bleeding following IM injection in individuals diagnosed with thrombocy topenia or any coagulation disorder. In addition, Section 4.4 states that if an individual has a history of ITP, the risks of developing low platelet levels should be considered before vaccination with JCOVDEN , and platelet monitoring is recommended following vaccination with JCOVDEN . Impact on the Risk -Benefit Balance of the Product: ITP is a potentiall y life-threatening event, and if not recognized or managed appropriatel y, may result in persistent or signifi cant disability or incapacity , and hence requires immediate medical intervention. ITP has been reported very rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S and adequate risk minimization via the SmPC is considered sufficient to manage this risk. Based on current clinical trial and postmarketing data and the information in the SmPC, the risk-benefit balance for the vaccine is considered to remain favorable for the indicated target populations. Public Health I mpact: Based on the currentl y available information on the known frequency, clinical characteristics, and outcome of ITP events reported after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination, the public health impact is expected to be low.

Activation of endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocy tes with subsequent formation of microparticles can trigger the coagulation system through the induction of tissue factor (Branchford 2018). An underl ying mechanism for VTE without thrombocytopenia has not been confirmed. Natural infection with SARS -CoV -2 has shown to be associated with hypercoagulability , (Ribes 2020). The SARS -CoV -2 S protein has been associated with endothelial inflammation, leukocy te adhesion, release Zheng 2021) , and is hypothesized to be related to adverse effects after COVID -19 vaccination (Trougakos 2022). Recent mechanistic studies (nonclinical studies, and studies using clinical trial samples )conducted by the MAH to study the pathogenesis of (vaccine -induced) TTS with potential relevance to VTE, did not elucidate a clear mechanism of action for VTE following Ad26.COV2.S administration. However, in the context of the MAH's mechanistic work on TTS, the hypothesis was tested if TTS and other thrombotic events could have a common mechanism with TTS being the most severe manifestation. Obtained data suggest that a common mechanism is unlikely . Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: VTE has been observed rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. While a higher proportion of cases of VTE was observed within the Ad26.COV2.S group versus the Placebo group in trial COV3001, there was no increase in VTE events among individuals who received Ad26.COV2.S in trial COV3009.

Annex 1 MedDRA Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 and pericarditis Potential Mechanisms: Infectious diseases account for the majority of cases of myocarditis or pericarditis in previously healthy patients, mainly due to either a direct viral infection or post-viral immune -mediat ed reaction and myocardial inflammation (Friedrich 2009) and is more frequent in young males . Also viral infection with SARS -CoV -2 can result in acute myocarditis, yet COVID -19 vaccination (including mRNA vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S) associated ased risk myocarditis, myocardial infarction, and -19 (Jiang 2023, Kim 2022, Patone 2022). The mechanism of action for vaccine -induced myopericarditis remains to be elucidated. Given the increased incidence among male s, differ ences in hormone signaling might be involved in the pathophy siology (Heymans 2022). It has been proposed that vaccines triggering an intense immune response could be associated with a higher risk of myocarditis (Karlstad 2022). Also, a possible association of circulating S protein with the occurrence of myocarditis has been described (Yonker 2023). Molecular mimicry between the S protein of SARS -CoV -2 and cardiac self- antigens is another possible mechanism. However, only limited experimental evidence suppo rting this hypothesis exists (Vojdani 2020, Vojdani 2021). The delivery of the Spike gene by different vaccine delivery platforms may result in a different expression pattern of the S protein, thus potentially affecting parameters like levels, kinetics, location and/or post-translational modifications. There are also differences in the biosy nthesis, structural features, and presentation of the S protein in current COVID -19 vaccines (Heinz 2021) that may be additionally related to myo/pericarditis incidence. Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: Myocarditis and/or pericarditis have been reported as rare event sfollowing vaccination against smallpox, hepatitis B, tetanus, human- papilloma virus, and viral influenza and have been documented for COVID -19 vaccines (Mei 2018, Su 2021). A systemic review and meta -analysis revealed higher incidence of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination but no significant difference after influenza vaccinations compared to COVID -19 vaccination (L ing 2022). Among COVI D-19 vaccines, myocarditis and/or pericarditis 2022, Ling 2022, Patone 2022) with an incidence significantly higher in males versus females, in people younger than 30 years, and after a second dose (compared to first or third dose). Additionally , a recombinant adjuvanted protein -based COVID -19 vaccine has been associated with a disproportional myopericarditis induction (Mac\u00edas Saint -Gerons 2023). Events of m yocarditis and pericarditis have been observed very rarel y following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S both in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. Real-world evidence data of US claims data sources showed a high level of certainty of anincreased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis for males aged 18 to 39 y ears within 28 day s of vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S.

Postmarketing Experience Cumulatively , from launch to 24 February 2023, a total of 436myocarditis/pericarditis primary dose cases have been received from postmarketing experience, of which 197 cases reported myocarditis and 177cases reported pericarditis (4 of these cases reported both myocarditis and pericarditis [Brighton Collaboration Level 1-3]) within the risk window of 42 days.Excluding solicited cases, this represents a spontaneous reporting rate of 4.32 cases per million doses administered for myocarditis and 4.15 cases per million doses administered for pericarditis (limited to B righton Collaboration Level 1-4).Of the 436 cases, 22 had a fatal outcome. In terms of gender distribution, 278 cases were reported as male , 128 were reported as female , and 30 cases did not have gender reported . The age/gender group with the highest number of cases were males aged 18 to 29 years (n=102). In this group, almost half of the patients (n=49) developed myocarditis/pe ricarditis within 7 day s following vaccination. Cumulatively , from launch to 24 February 2023, a total of 33myocarditis/pericarditis booster dose cases (20homologous and 13heterologous) have been received from postmarketing experience. Of these 33 cases , 8 cases after heterologous administration were excluded from further assessment since the events of interest did not occur after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. Of the remaining 25cases , 18cases reported myocarditis and 9 cases reported these cases reported JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 73both myocarditis and pericarditis), none had a fatal outcome. Excluding solicited cases, this represents a spontaneous reporting rate of 4.47 cases per million doses administered for myocarditis and2.55 cases per million doses administered for pericarditis (limited to Brighton Collaboration Level 1-4).In terms of gender distribution, 17cases were reported as male , 4were reported as female , and 4 cases did not have gender reported . In areal-world evidence rapid cycle analysisof data from 3 US claims datasets (cut-off date: February 2023; including age and gender stratified analysis), there wasa high level of certainty of an increased risk of composite my ocarditis- pericarditis following the first Ad26.COV2.S dose for males ag ed 18 to 39 years in 1 to 14 day s (meta -analy sis relative risk estimates = 2.3-5.4 )and 1 to 28 days (meta -analysis relative risk estimates = 1.1-3.3); of myocarditis for aged 18 to 39years in 1to 14days (meta -analysis relative risk estimates = 2.8-7.0) ; and of pericarditis for males aged 18 to 39 years in 1to 14 day s (meta -analy sis relative risk estimates = 1.7-5.0 )and 1 to 28 days (meta -analysis relative risk estimates = 1.3-5.2 ). There was a lack of evidence of increased risks for other sex-age groups; however, data are insufficient to confidently exclude the possibility of small effects in these groups . Risk Factors and Risk Groups: Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in association with SARS -CoV -2 infection. Historically , myocarditis and/or pericarditis have been reported as a rare event following vaccination against smallpox, hepatitis B and viral influenza (Su 2021). Myocarditis and pericarditis have also been reported with other COVID -19 vaccines (including mRNA -based COVID -19 vaccines and a recombinant adjuvanted protein- based COVID -19 vaccine). Young males appear to be at highest risk, predominantly after receiving the second dose of COVID -19 vaccination . The disease course is self-limiting in a vast majority of cases: 95% of patients show a rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of cardiac biomarkers, electro -and echocardiographic findings within day s (Klamer 2022). Preventability : The SmPC Section 4.4 states that healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis and should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat these conditions. Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop sy mptoms indicative of my ocarditis or pericarditis. Impact on the Risk -Benefit Balance of the Product: Myocarditis and/or pericarditis has been reported very rarely in clinical trials and the post- marketing setting following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Based on current clinical trial and postmarketing data and the information in the SmPC, the identified risk of myocarditis and pericarditis does not change the existing established risk -benefit balance for Ad26.COV2.S.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 74Public Health I mpact: The occurrence of myocarditis and pericarditis is very rare following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Epidemiologic analysis of real-world data sources such as electronic medical records and healthcare claims, showed that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID -19 vaccination is lower than following natural SARS -CoV -2 infection (Patone 2022). Therefore, the public health impact is currently considered to be low. Annex 1 MedDRA 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 75Important Potential Risk: Vaccine- associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine - associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Potential Mechanisms: Potential mechanisms of enhanced disease may include both T cell-mediated immune responses (a Th2- skewed immune response favoring immunopathology ) and antibody -mediated immune responses (antibod y responses with insufficient neutralizing activity leading to formation of immune complexes and activation of complement or allowing for Fc-mediated increase in viral entry to cells) (Graham 2020). Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: Based on past experiences in the development of vaccines against RSV, Dengue virus, SARS -CoV ,and MERS -CoV, there is a theoretical risk for VAED, including VAERD, for SARS -CoV -2 vaccines (Chin 1969, Fulginiti 1969, Kapikian 1969, Kim 1969, Su 2020, Agrawal 2016, Bolles 2011, 2006, Honda -okubo 2015, Houser 2017 ). AsCOVID -19 clinical manifestations are not limited to respiratory symptoms, not only VAERD, but also the broader term VAED is being taken into account. VAED/VAERD has not been described in association with JCOVDEN and has not been confirmed from an y other late phase clinical trial of other COVID -19vaccine s. Studies in Ad26.COV2.S -immunized Syrian hamsters and NHP conducted by the MAH have shown the absence of enhanced lung pathology , absence of increased viral load, and absence of enhanced clinical signs of disease compared with controls after SARS -CoV -2 inoculation, even under conditions of suboptimal immunity allowing breakthrough infection (van der Lubbe 2021, He 2021). Together with induction of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1- skewed immune response after Ad26.COV2.S dosing, these data suggest that the theoretical risk of VAERD and VAED for Ad26.COV2.S is low. These data were corroborated by the findings in clinical trials which have shown no indication of the presence of VAED, including VAERD. Characterization of the Risk: Clinical Trial D ata No events of VAED or VAERD were reported. In the primary pooling, case splits for COVID -19 associated SAEs and deaths showed a lower incidence of severe COVID -19 in the Ad26.COV2.S versus the placebo group. Therefore, there was no evidence for VAED/VAERD. No new information to further characterize this safet y concern was identified from clinical trials evaluating an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose as compared with the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 76COV3012 (Sisonke 24 2022 , no VAED/VAERD cases were retrieved from studiesCOV3012 and COV3021. Postmarketing E xperience Up to 24 August 2022, 1 primary dose case reported by a healthcare professional was reported as VAED following Ad26.COV2.S administration. However, no clinical details were available for this individual , nor information on its SARS -CoV .2 status, and therefore this case is not assessable . Risk Factors and Risk Groups: It is postulated that the potential risk may be increased in individuals producing lower neutralizing antibody titers or in those demonstrating waning immunity (Graham 2020, Munoz 2020) . Preventability : An effective vaccine against COVI D-19 that produces strong humoral and cellular immune responses with a clear Th1 bias is expected to mitigate the risk of VAED, including VAERD (Lambert 2020, Graham 2020). Such an immune profile is elicited by Ad26.COV2.S in clinical trials and nonclinical studies. Impact on the Risk -Benefit Balance of the Product: A confirmed risk of VAED, includ ing VAERD could significantl y impact the risk -benefit balance of Ad26.COV2.S. The risk will be further characterized through follow -up of study participants in Phase 3 trials for the occurrence of severe COVID -19. Within post-authori sation effectiveness studies, the incidence of severe COVID -19 in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated populations will be used as an indirect measure of VAED, including VAERD. Public Health I mpact: The potential risk of VAED, including VAERD could have a public health impact if large populations of individuals are affected.

Presentation of the Missing Information Missing information: Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding Evidence source: There is limited experience with the use of Ad26.COV2.S in pregnant women. Animal data from the EF -PPND toxicity study with Ad26.COV2.S indicate no adverse effect of Ad26.COV2.S on reproductive performance, fertility, ovarian and uterine examinations, or parturition. In ad dition, there was no adverse effect of vaccination on fetal body weights, external, visceral and skeletal evaluations, or on postnatal development of the offspring. Pregnancy at baseline was not an exclusion criterion in trial COV2008, and trial COV2004 is a trial in pregnant women. U p tothe cut-off date of 24 February 2022 , 23women who were pregnant at baseline received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S (cross -dose level pooling ; all dose level s).Of the pregnancies reported in trial COV2004 (n=22), 9 were still ongoing, 11 had a normal outcome ,and 2had an outcome of preterm neonate (1 without complications and 1 with complications) . The pregnancy reported in trial COV2008 had an outcome of premature without complications . No safety concerns have been identified in this population. Any case of study vaccine exposure during pregnancy was included in the Company's Global Safety Database when reported during the course of the trials . As of the cut -off date of 24 February 2022, 154unique pregnanc ieswere retrieved from Company- sponsored clinical trials post-baseline ; 132involved maternal exposure and 22were partner pregnancies ; all following Ad26.COV2.S administration . Overall, reported outcomes were live birth (n= 10), spontaneous abortion (n=19), still birth (n=2), anembryonic abortion (n=4), unknown (n=1 17).Of note, 1 participant reported 2 pregnancies during the trial (1with an outcome of spontaneous abortion, 1with an unknown outcome). Up to the cut-off date of 24 August 2022, 700 unique cases reporting use in pregnancy were retrieved from postmarketing sources (including spontaneous and solicited primary and booster dose cases) ; 698involved maternal exposure and 2were partner pregnancy . Of these unique pregnancy cases, 200cases reported 204 outcomes due to 4twin pregnancies . One twin pregnancy resulted in a spontaneous abortion of one twin and a live birth without congenital anomaly of the other and are included in the following counts. The outcomes included live birth without congenital anomaly (n= 123 [including 1 set of (n= 56[including 2 of ea ch of congenital anomaly ,still birth with congenital anomaly , maternal death, and intrauterine death . Of the 56 spontaneous abortion outcomes , there were 10outcomes with exposure before conception, 25outcomes with exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy, and for the remaining 21outcomes timing of vaccine exposure was not reported. Safety data with Ad26.COV2.S when administered within 3 months before pregnancy as well as during pregnancy have shown no safety concerns in the m other or child in over 500 reported pregnancies, with over 100 reported pregnancy outcomes. Breastfeeding women were excluded from all clinical trials, except from the Phase 2 trial COV2008 and the Phase 3 trials COV3001, COV3003, and COV3009. Up to the cut-off date of 24 February 2022, 718 women who were breastfeeding at baseline have received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S (cross -dose level pooling ; all dose levels ). No safety concerns have been identified for breastfeeding women. However, safety data for their breastfed child renis currently not available. Up to 24 August 2022, there have been 135unique cases (postmarketing spontaneous or non - interventional cases) of exposure to JCOVDEN via breastfeeding. No safety signals were identified. It is no t known whether the components of Ad26.COV2.S or the antibodies induced by Ad26.COV2.S are excreted in human milk. Human data are not available to assess the impact of Ad26.COV2.S on milk production or its effects on the breastfed child.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 78Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: Based on the nonreplicating nature of the vaccine and on nonclinical and limited clinical and postmarketing data available to date, the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S when used in pre gnant women is not expected t o differ from that in the general population, with no specific safety concerns for pregnant women or fetuses to date. Therefore, as stated in the SmPC Section 4.6, the administration of JCOVDEN in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential bene fits outweigh any potential risks to the mother and fetus . A Phase 2 trial (COV2004) and a post -authoris ation pregnancy exposure registry (COV4005) are ongoing to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in pregnant women and their offspring. The adequacy of the post -authoris ation safety study COV4003 to address pregnancy outcomes is to be assessed. No effects on the breastfed child are anticipated considering results from animal and human studies with Ad26- based vaccines, showing limited dissem ination of this nonreplicating vector following IM injection. In the event that a small quantity of Ad26.COV2.S would be (transiently) excreted via the milk, it would not be considered a risk to the breastfed child, specifically with regard to infections, as Ad26.COV2.S is replication -incompetent and does not encode a complete SARS -CoV -2 virus. Breastfeeding women are being included in trials COV3001 and COV3009 to characterize the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S in this subpopulation. A small subset of participants within trial COV2004 will be followed up during breastfeeding to assess the transfer of antibodies via breast milk. Breastfeeding women were also allowed to participate in trials COV2008 and COV3003. Missing information: Use in immunocompromised patients Evidence source: Patients with stable and well -controlled medical condition including comorbidities associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID -19 (eg, stable/well -controlled HIV infection), or thos e receiving chronic low -dose (less than 20 mg of prednisone or equivalent) immunosuppressive therapy were included in trials COV2008, COV3001 ,and COV3009 . The efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals. The final analysis results of the double -blind phase in trial COV3001 showed that , overall, the vaccine was efficacious against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 with onset at least 14 days and 28 days after vaccination across demographic and baseline chara cteristics subgroups. An exception was noted for HIV -positive participants (with a stable/well -controlled HIV infection) in which the VE was lower. Due to few COVID -19 cases in HIV -positive participants, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution. No clinically relevant difference in the reactogenicity profile could be observed in HIV -infected versus HIV -negative participants (COV3001 CSR Dec2021). In the FAS of trial COV3001, SAEs were reported in 8 (1.3%) out of 604HIV-infected participants who received Ad26.COV2.S , of which none were considered to be related to the study vaccine by the investigator. The frequency of reported SAEs was similar in the Ad26.COV2.S and [Ad26 .COV2.S Plan 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 79Based on t he final analysis results of the double -blind phase in trial COV3009, no conclusion can currently be made about VE in HIV -infected participants due to the limited number of HIV -positive participants. In the FAS of trial COV3009, SAEs were reported in 3 (1.4%) out of 213 HIV -infected participants who received Ad26.COV2.S, of which non ewere considered to be related to the study vaccine by the investigator. The frequency of reported SAEs was similar in the Ad26.COV2.S and Placebo groups (COV3009 CSR Dec 2021). Of the 65,490 participants in the cross -dose level pooling who received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S (all dose levels), 1,440 (2.2%) participants had a stable/well -controlled HIV infection. Participants with other immunodeficiencies were included at low numbers. Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: Given the fact that Ad26.COV2.S is a replication -incompetent vaccine, the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S when used in immunocompromised individuals is not expected to differ from that in the general population . There were no specific safety concerns and no notable differences between HIV - infected and healthy participants with regard to reporting frequency or severity of A Es at any timepoint from trial sCOV3001 and COV3009 . Use in immunocompromised patients will be further characterized in the post -authoris ation safety studies COV4003 andCOV4001 and effectiveness studies COV4004 andCOV4002 . Missing information: Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Evidence source: There is limited information on the safety of Ad26.COV2.S in individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders and a theoretical concern that the vaccine may exacerbate their underlying disease. Participants with clinical conditions stable under non -immunomodulator tre atment (eg, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis) were eligible for enrollment in Phase 3 trials COV3001 and COV3009 at the discretion of the investigator .Of the 21,898 participants in the FAS of trial COV3001 who received Ad26.COV2.S ( 5x1010vpdose level) , 552 participants had a medical history of at least 1 immune -mediated/autoimmune disorder at baseline . Of these 552 participants, 5 (0.9%) reported a n exacerbation (flare -up) of their pre- existing autoimmune disorder during the double -blind phase of the trial. Of the 15,708 participants in the FAS of trial COV3009 who received at least 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S ( 5x1010vpdose level) , 458participants had a medical history of at least 1 imm une-mediated/autoimmune disorder at baseline . Of these 458 participants, 2 (0.4 %) reported an exacerbation (flare- up) of their pre -existing autoimmune disorder , during the double -blind phase of the trial.

In additi on, the safety profile in this subpopulation could vary from that seen in healthy adults. Increased age and comorbidities are the 2major risk factors for frailty. Of the 65,490 participants in the cross -dose level pooling who received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S (all dose levels) , 25,737 (39.3%)participants had 1 or more comorbidities associated with an increased risk for severe COVID -19.Of these 25,737 participants , 11,102 (43.1 %) were 6,378 were 65 years, and 1,216 (4.7%) were aged 75years. There is limited information on the safety of Ad26.COV2.S in frail patients with comorbidities that may compromise their immune response. Following a protocol amendment for trial COV3001 on 14 December 2020, calculation of a fr ailty index has been included to be applied to participants enrolled. Of the 19,577 participants in the P er Protocol set who received Ad26.COV2. S (5x1010vpdose level) , 6 (<0.1%) were defined as frail and 2,147 (11.0%) were defined as pre -frail. Of the 6 frail participants , 5 (83.3%) were aged 60 years. Of the 2,147 pre -frail participants , 1,338 (COV3001 Dec 2021) . Population in need of further characterization: Safety data will be collected in individuals who are frail due to age or debilitating disease in trial COV3001, in the post -authoris ation safety studies COV4003 and COV4001 , in the post -authorization effectiveness study COV4002, and through routine pharmacovigilance. Missing information: Interaction wi th other vaccines Evidence source: As no interaction studies have been performed, t here are no data to assess if concomitant administration of Ad26.COV2.S with other vaccines may affect the efficacy or safety of either vaccine .

Based on long -term safety data from other Ad26 -based vaccines (at least 6 months up to 5years post-vaccination in clinical trials), no long- term safety issues have been identified (Adenoviral Vaccine Safety Database V7.0 2022 ). Population in need of further characterization: The long -term safety of Ad26.COV2.S is not fully known, however there are no known risks with a potentially late onset based on the available evidence with other Ad26 -based vaccines. Long- term safety data are being collected for at least 2 years in ongoing trials COV3001 and COV3009 following administration of Ad26.COV2.S, and for up to 1 year in the post -authorization safety studies COV4003 and COV4001. Participants of trials COV3001 and COV3009 who initially received placebo were unblinded and offered a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (crossover vaccination) ,since the vaccine has received an EUA in the United States and conditional Marketing Authorisation in the E uropean U nion/EEA .

Due to the special circumstances of the pandemic, enhancement of these routine activities has been undertaken. The MAH has a Globa l Safety Database in place to manage the receipt, processing, and reporting of individual and aggregate safet y data to regulatory authorities, and to support pharmacovigilance activities including safet y signal detection and ongoing evaluation of the benef it-risk profile of the vaccine. The MAH conduct sboth passive and active surveillance activities for continued vaccine safet y monitoring, as further specified below. ICSR reporting The MAH submit sICSRs in accordance to GVP Module VI, GVP Product ation- Specific Considerations I: Vaccines for prophy laxis against infectious diseases, and the detailed guidance on ICSRs in the context of COVID -19 (EMA 2022b ). Follow -up for spontaneous and solicited ICSRs ICSRs are followed up promptly to obtain additional information relevant to the report as necessary to provide a complete description of the safet y event. Two follow -up attempts are performed for all ICSRs regardless of validity (non-valid/valid case), seriousness, expectedness, or causal relatio nship. For all ICSRs with product exposure during pregnancy (regardless of source, including literature reports), 2 additional follow -up attempts are performed to obtain information regarding pregnancy outcome in addition to the standard 2 follow -up attemp ts. The MAH has created an AESI list including events recommended by Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC), the ACCESS protocol, the US CDC, and the MHRA .

The RMP details important risks of JCOVDEN , how these risks can be minimize d, and how more information will be obtained about JCOVDEN 's risks and uncertainti es (missing information). JCOVDEN 's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how JCOVDEN should be used. This summary of the RMP for JCOVDEN should be read in the context of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary , all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of JCOVDEN 's RMP. I. The Vaccine and What it is Used For JCOVDEN is authori sedfor active immunization toprevent COVID -19 caused severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 ( SARS -CoV -2)in individuals 18years of age and older (see SmPC for the full indication). I t contains Ad26.COV2.S as the active substance and it is given by intramuscular injection . Further information about the evaluation of JCOVDEN 's benefits can be found in JCOVDEN 's EPAR, including in its plain -language summary , available on the European Medicines Agenc y vaccine's webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/ -19-vaccine - janssen. A ssociated With the Vaccine and A ctivities to Minimize or Further Characterize the Risks Important risks of JCOVDEN , together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about JCOVDEN 's risks , are outlined below. Measures to minimize the risks identified for vaccines can be: Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PLand SmPC addressed to individuals and health care professionals; Important advice on the vaccine 's packaging; The authori sedpack size \u2014the amount of vaccine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the vaccine is used correctl y; The vaccine 's legal status \u2014the way a vaccine is supplied to the individual (eg,with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.JCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 114Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularl yanaly zedincluding Periodic Benefit -Risk Evaluation Report/Periodic Safet y Update Report assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary . These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. If important information that may affec t the safe use of JCOVDEN isnot yet available, it is listed under 'missing information' below. II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information Important risks of JCOVDEN are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the vaccine can be safel y administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of JCOVDEN . Potential risks are concer ns for which an association with the use of this vaccine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safet y of the vaccine that is cur rently missing and needs to be collected ( eg,on the long -term use of the vaccine ). List of Important Risks and Missing Information Important identified risks Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome -associated enhanced disease (VAED) , including vaccine - associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Missing information Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding Use in immunocompromised patients Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Use in frail patients with comorbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] , diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Interaction with other vaccines Long- term safetyJCOVDEN ( VAC31518 [Ad26 .COV2.S ]) Risk Management Plan Version 7.1 Final for Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/00 71/G-HA approval date 08/06/2023 CONFIDENTIAL 115II.B. Summary of Important Risks Important Identified Risk: Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome Evidence for linking the risk to the medicineThrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia (TTS) , in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following vaccination with JCOVDEN and is an adverse drug reaction described in the SmPC . Risk factors and risk groups Although no clear risk factors have been identified, the cases of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia reported in the postmarketing setting more commonly occurred in individuals aged <60years. Risk minimization measures Routine risk minimization measures: SmPC Section 4.3 SmPC Section 4.4 SmPC Section 4.8 PL Section 2 PL Section 4 SmPC Section 4.4, and PL Section 2 provide recommendations to address the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome .

Similar adverse event s have also been described following administration of other COVID -19 vaccines. Despite no clear biological mechanism being identified, the MAH considers the increase in observed versus expected ratios since authorisation to be sufficient evidence for a plausible association between JCOVDEN and GBS . Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome is an adverse drug reaction described in the SmPC. Risk factors and risk groups There are no known risk factors for the development of GBS following JCOVDEN vaccination. Based mainly on data from North America and Europe, it has been shown in literature that the GBS incidence increased by 20% for every 10- year increase in age; GBS is usually more frequent in males, with the highest incidence between 50 to 70years of age. Risk minimization measures Routine risk minimization measures: SmPC Section 4.4 SmPC Section 4.8 PL Section 2 PL Section 4 SmPC Section 4.4, and PL Section 2provide recommendations to address the risk of Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome .

This included cases with bleeding and cases with fatal outcome. Some of these cases occurred in individuals with a history of ITP. Based on the observed imbalance in postmarketing events, ITP is an adverse drug reaction described in the SmPC. Risk factors and risk groups Limited data from postmarketing experience with JCOVDEN , including literature, suggest that individuals with chronic or recurrent ITP may be at increased risk of developing ITP following vaccina tion with JCOVDEN .

While a higher proportion of cases of VTE was observed within the JCOVDEN group versus the Placebo group in trial COV3001, there was no increase in VTE events among individuals who received JCOVDEN in tria l COV3009. VTE is an adverse drug reaction described in the SmPC. Risk factors and risk groups In trial sCOV3001 and COV3009 , underlying risk factor s have been identified in participants with VTE such as COVID -19, male gender, old age (>65 years), long -haul travel, thrombophilia, obesity, active malignancy, trauma, previous venous thrombosis, hypertension, and COPD. Risk minimization measures Routine risk minimization measures: SmPC Section 4.4 SmPC Section 4.8 PL Section 2 PL Section 4 SmPC Section 4.4, and PL Section 2 provide recommendations to address the risk of VTE.

A s ystemic rev iew and meta -analysis revealed higher incidence of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination but no significant difference after influenza vaccinations compared to COVID -19 vaccination. Among COVID -19 vaccines, myocarditis and/or pericarditis has been observed with mRNA vaccines with an incidence significantly higher in males versus females, in people younger than 30 years, and after a second dose (compared to first or third dose). Additionally, a recombinant adjuvanted protein- based COVID -19 vaccine h as been associated with a disproportional myopericarditis induction. Events of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed very rarely following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S both in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. Real-world evidence data of US claims data sources showed a high level of certainty of an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis for males aged 18 to 39 years within 28days of vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Myocarditis and pericarditis are adverse drug reactions descr ibed in the SmPC. Risk factors and risk groups Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in association with SARS -CoV -2 infection. Historically, myocarditis and/or pericarditis have been reported as a rare event following vaccination against smallpox, hepatitis B and viral influenza. Myocarditis and pericarditis have also been reported with other COVID -19 vaccines (including mRNA-based COVID -19 vaccines and a recombinant adjuvanted protein -based COVID -19 vaccine). Young males appear to be at highest risk, predominantly after receiving the second d oseof COVID - 19 vaccination . The disease course is self -limiting in a vast majority of cases: 95% of patients show a rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of cardiac biomarkers, electro -and echocardiographic findings within days.

Important Potential Risk: Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine - associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Evidence for linking the risk to the medicineVAED/VAERD has not been described in association with JCOVDEN and has not been confirmed from any other late phase clinical trial of other COVID -19 vaccine s. Forcandidate SARS -CoV -2 vaccines, no evidence of VAED or VAERD after intramuscular immunization h as been reported to date in nonclinical studies or clinical trials. Nevertheless, in the absence of long -term safety and efficacy data, the evidence is not yet sufficient to fully dismiss VAED, including VAERD as a safety concern, and it remains an important potential risk. Risk factors and risk groups It is postulated that the potential risk may be increased in individuals producing lower neutralizing antibody titers or in those demonstrating waning immunity.
