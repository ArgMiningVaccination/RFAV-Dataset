PlUS: fOreigN exPOSUre n TiPS fOr liViNg n a cONVerSa TiON Charles Little, '69, at home with Gladys, his 1913 Model T FordCharlie Little, '69, has been a Ford guy forever. It started in high school, when he wanted to buy a M odel T and his father said, no, get a M odel A instead; it's safer. He did and eventually owned a series of Model As up through medical school. His current stable consists of a 1913 Model T (named \"Gladys\" in honor of his mother, who was born that year); a 1923 Model T panel delivery truck (with vintage lettering on the side commemo- rating his grandfather, who ran a meat-and-provisions business out of a similar vehicle many years ago); a 1924 Model T Touring Car, a 1930 Model A sedan and a 1 931 Model A roadster, still in pieces. Little built a six-stall garage next to his home in South Paris, Maine, to house his treasures. He stays busy knocking down and rebuilding them\u2014or having them rebuilt, since he's no master mechanic\u2014and hunting around for parts online. There's a sizable Model T community out there, with some 7,000 member families nationwide. In 2008, Little and his wife, Mary, attended a g athering in Richmond, Ind., that marked the 100th anniversary of the first Model T ever to reach market, in the autumn of 1908. Nearly a thousand cars were on the scene, attended by their proud owners. A highlight of the weeklong event saw between 300 and 400 Model Ts passing in review, which Little calls \"the longest parade ever of a single model car.\" Little has always made some room for fun, skiing in the winter months, and lately, buffing and tinkering with his cars. \"I didn't let medicine be my whole life,\" he says, \"and you have to keep busy when you retire, or else you rust.\" \u2014bruce morgan 33638ifc-01.indd 1 10/18/13 1:45 PM12 feature s 12 Crossing Borders Tej Maini is leading the hunt for foreign medical graduates to fill residency slots at Tufts. by Bruce Morgan 16 Growing New Synapses The medical school undergoes its first major reorganization in more than a c entury to promote catalytic research. by Bruce Morgan 19 Brain Trust Medical faculty members have teamed up with Boston high school teachers to get kids excited about science. by Jacqueline Mitchell CoveR SToRy 22 The Contrarian Our theoretical models in biology are not working so well lately, says Ana Soto.

That is, like any healthy primate, they nibble a b it of healthy stuff every 30 or 40 minutes, or whenever they feel a h unger pang. They may, of course, have two or three meals a w eek for the socialness and fun of it. On this regime, both weight and blood pressure may drop significantly, while tod- dlers on up have been shown to self-select a perfectly balanced diet if one is presented and no junk food is available. If this idea spreads widely, we'll undoubt- edly see a significant drop in ob esity and its attendant problems, even as we acknowledge the studies showing that family me als, while they can be enjoyable, are not necessary for socializing or engendering togetherness. robert e. kay, '57 philadelphia, pa antidepressants in pregnan cy As a p sychiatrist and psychopharma- cologist specializing in mood disorders, I appreciated the cautionary notes sounded by perinatologist Dr. Adam U rato in his discussion of antidepressant use during pregnancy (W inter 2013). Dr. Urato rightly points to some potential risks of maternal antidepressant exposure during pregnancy, including, for example, increased risk of miscarriage, birth defects and preterm birth. However after consult- ing with my colleague at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Dr. Linda Chaudron, a s pecialist in the treatment of psychiatric disorders during pregnancy, I w ould like to offer a b roader perspective on antidepressants. Major depression is a serious condition, often associated with m arked distress, incapacity and an elevated risk of suicide. Whereas the risks Dr. Urato discusses weigh against use of antidepressants with mild-to-moderate major de pression\u2014 which often responds to \" talk therapy\" alone\u2014the risk/benefit ratio may shift for patients with severe, refractory or \"malig- nant\" major depression. As Dr. Lee Cohen of Massachusetts General Hospital recently observed, these more severely afflicted patients may require antidepressant treatment, given their ele- vated risk of self-harm; potential harm to the fetus and the relatively small absolute risk associated with SSRI use during preg- nancy. (See www.womensmentalhealth.org/ posts/drugs-pregnancy-lactation.) Of course, I fully agree with Dr. Urato that in every instance of major de pres- sion during pregnancy, a carefully detailed risk/benefit discussion with the patient is essential. ronald pies clinical professor of psychiatry tufts school of medicine our mistake A photo that app eared as part of our com- mencement coverage in the Summer 2013 issue m isidentified the faculty member embracing Sally Gr eenwald, M.D./M.P.H, '13, as she was about to r eceive her diploma from D ean H arris Berman.

But it was not always so. I can well remember the complete absence of financial talk from m y professors and among my peers when I g raduated from me dical school in 1964. Back then, no one would ever talk about mo ney, almost like certain families you may know where the subject never comes up. The whole presumption 50 years ago was that we doctors would learn what we needed to k now on the job. Since the advent of Medicare in 1965 and the arrival of a host of new health- care delivery systems and insurance models in the 1970s, '80s and '90s, the world of the practicing physician is much mo re complicated now. In fact, one of the comments I h ear most frequently as dean is that we here at the me di- cal school should be doing a b etter job o f teaching our students about all the financial realities that lie just beyond our gates. It's a fair suggestion, but let me a sk you: When do yo u suppose the best time to do t hat teaching might be? I believe that medical school is too early in the scheme of things for students to be learning about the complexities of practice. Our me dical-care mo dels in this country are constantly in flux. I would argue that by the time our students finish their residency training, whatever prevailing model we taught them about may well have changed. For the past 15 years, your medical school, in partnership with Tufts Health Plan, has sponsored the Tufts Health Care Institute (THCI). Together, we have been offering a m inirotation called \"Practicing Medicine in a C hanging Health-Care Environment\" for residents in their last year of training to address this content gap in the standard me dical curriculum. Our intensive four-day program is held each August and is open to s enior and chief resident applicants from around the northeastern United States at just the right point, I think, before they plunge into their me dical careers. The Tufts minirotation is a g reat program in which I'm privileged to par- ticipate by speaking at the opening session on the evolution of the U.S. health- care system, based in part on my personal experience in the field. The general goal of the minirotation, as Rosalie Phillips, the THCI director, has expressed it, is to help participants understand the context in which they will go on to become effective practitioners. The size and feel of the minirotation are intimate. Enrollment is limited to about 25 people. Everything is handled seminar-style, with plenty of discus- sion filling the air during every segment. This year's program lineup broke into four parts. On Monday, the theme w as \"The Organization and Financing of the U.S. Health-Care System.\" (This is the day on which I spoke.) Tuesday focused on \"Quality Matters,\" with individual speakers addressing issues fall 2013 tuft s me dicine 3 PHOTO: ALONSO NiCHOLS medical practice unpacked arising from such topics as the public reporting of physician performance and the growing role of medical informatics in contemporary practice. Wednesday tackled the complexities of cost, access, care management and all the new m odels of care that are emerging. Thursday was devoted to health reform and what new forms, requirements and opportunities the future practice of medi- cine might assume. On each day, expert speakers\u2014many of whom a re full or adjunct Tufts faculty\u2014would offer well- informed commentary in digestible pre- sentations lasting between an hour and an hour-and-a-half. The four days were packed with provocative material explored among peers. Regardless of the particulars of your own experience, I'm sure you can well appreciate the value of timely, concentrated dialogue like this for a y oung resident poised to embark on his or her medical career. Rosalie tells me that she routinely hears expressions of heartfelt gratitude from participants at her program's conclu- sion. They often say something along the lines of, \"We don't get this anywhere else. This is the best education we've ever had on the health-care system.\" I like to think we are do ing something really worthwhile with this program. And of course, our patients, both current and future, will be the ones who benefit mo st.from t he d ean harris a. berman, m.d. dean, tufts university school of medicine 33638p02-03.indd 3 10/18/13 1:52 PMpulse 4 tuft s me dicine 2013a of people & events IllustratIon: ryan snookot that anyone's asking fo r it under the golden arches or anywhere else right now, but a h amburger patty grown entirely in the laboratory was served at a taste test in London recently and left people thinking about what might satisfy tomorrow's app etites. Two volunteers who sampled the burger\u2014an Austrian nutritionist and a U .S. journalist\u2014said the texture of the thing was fine, but flavor was lacking; both said they would have liked some s alt, pepper, cheese or onions to e xcite the taste buds mo re, the Associated Press reported. Mark Post, the Dutch scientist who grew the meat from cattle stem cells in his lab over a fi ve-year period, didn't take the criticism personally: \"It's not perfect, but it's a good start.\" Post noted that producing me at this way has the potential to h elp feed the world while also mitigating climate change. Sergey Brin, a c o-founder of Google, funded the $330,000 project out of a p ersonal concern for animal welfare. \"We're trying to c reate the first cultured-beef hamburger,\" he said in a s tatement at the time o f the taste test. Post's research team m ade the me at from shoulder muscle cells of two organically raised cows. The cells were put into a n utrient solution to help them de velop into m uscle tissue, and they eventually grew into small strands of me at. It took nearly 20,000 strands to make the single five-ounce patty used for the taste test. The burger came to t he table seasoned with salt, egg powder and breadcrumbs; red beet juice and saffron were added for coloring.\"I'm a v egetarian, but I w ould be first in line to try this,\" said Jonathan Garlick, director of the Center for Integrated Tissue Engineering at Tufts School of Dental Medicine, when an AP reporter asked him to comment on the lab burger. Garlick has used similar stem cell techniques to grow human skin in the lab, but wasn't involved in the hamburger research. Experts say that new and better ways of producing meat\u2014apart, that is, from enormous herds of animals grazing on large tracts of land, consuming natural resources as they go\u2014are needed to s at- isfy the world's steadily growing app etite. By 2050, it is predicted that global meat consumption will double as more people in de veloping countries are able to afford it.

Public health screenings of this kind have been going on for the past 100 years or mo re, often accompanied by vaccinations and letters sent home to parents if a problem is found. Massachusetts, which has had a w eight-screening program since 2009, is one of 21 states that have put statutes or advisories in place mandating that public schools collect height, weight and/or BMI (body-mass index) information about students. Some s tates further require that parents receive confidential letters informing them of the test results and advising that they discuss the findings with their child's doctor. A number of parents have objected to t he so-called \"fat letters,\" saying they are an intrusion into family matters. In Massachusetts, where parents are currently sent letters for students in grades one, four, seven and 10, the state public Health Department is debating a possible repeal of the notification process. That would be a grave mistake, in the view of Michael Flaherty, a pediatric resident physician at Baystate Medical Center, a Tufts affiliate in Springfield, Mass., and a c linical associate at the me di- cal school. \"The growing number of children and adolescents seen day in and day out in our clinics with hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes and musculoskeletal issues secondary to weight do n ot lie,\" he said. Flaherty outlined his views in a r ecent opinion piece in the journal Pediatrics. About 17 percent of U.S. teens and children are obese, three times the number in 1980, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One in three is considered either overweight or obese.Tipping The scales Who they are Completed applications: 8,647 offered admission: 526 Enrolled: 204 gender Male: 94 Female: 110 This is the first time women have outnumbered men.program enrollment M.D.: 169 M.D./M.P.H.: 20 M.D./M.B.a.: 10 track: feeder tufts: 7 northeastern: 7 uC/Berkeley: 6 university of Maine: 6MeeT THe Class of 2017roughly one third of american adults\u2014more than 76 million people\u2014have hypertension, or blood pressure registering 140/90 mm hg or higher, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. and of course, controlling blood pressure is criti- cal to reducing everyone's risk of a heart attack or stroke. But those patients who monitor their blood pressure at home may not be getting the best care for their condition, according to a study published this summer in the Annals of Internal Medicine. the researchers analyzed 52 studies that tracked patients who monitored their own blood pressure using some of the devic- es recently marketed to consumers\u2014with and without additional support from their doctor. the researchers found that those who self-monitored experienced mode st reductions in their blood pres- sure readings at six months, but drew even with the control group after a year. among those who paired self-monitoring with outside support, such as regular consultation with a doctor, the benefits lasted longer than a year. home blood-pressure monitoring can be useful, katrin Uhlig, a nephrologist at tufts medical center who was lead author of the article, told the Wall Street Journal. But to see major benefits, she noted, patients would need support from a doctor's office. \"you would need the infrastructure for trans- mission of [blood pressure] values and have systems in place to act on readings in a responsible way,\" she said.under pressure sourCE: oFFICE 12:05 PMcup of tea and a c ookie for an afternoon snack, while a p leas- ant routine, may not be supply- ing adequate nutrition for many baby boomers, a recent Tufts study suggests.

Research do ne by the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that consuming 90 grams of high-quality protein a d ay helps strengthen muscles. For reference, there are seven grams of protein in an ounce of cooked meat, eight grams in a c up of milk and six grams in an egg.

We endure the minor pain of a cut or scrape, stick on a bandage, and within a w eek, our skin looks like nothing ever happened. In some c ases, though, heal- ing isn't so simple. Somewhere along the way, the compl ex chain of events that lets the body repair itself breaks down, and a w ound remains open, raw. Such is the case with those who suffer from chronic foot ulcers, a nonhealing wound common in diabetics. \"For these foot ulcers, there are a variety of therapies, but they are only success- ful in roughly half the cases, and [the ulcers] have a h igh recurrence rate,\" says Jonathan Garlick, head of the Division of Cancer Biology and Tissue Engineering at Tufts School of Dental Medicine. If the wound doesn't heal, sometimes the only recourse is to a mputate the limb. Garlick's research could one day help patients avoid that kind of traumatic outcome. He studies pluripotent stem cells\u2014 a type of all-purpose cell that has the potential to become any type of tissue in the human body. Once cells like these are harnessed in the lab, he says, researchers can implant them directly into damaged tissue to stimulate healing. It's a radical new way of thinking about treating disease, and it offers possible cures for chronic conditions that may not otherwise heal on their own from diabetic foot ulcers to heart disease and even peri- odontal disease, where linger- ing inflammation can lead to bone and gum loss. \"There are millions of patients suffering from chronic, nonhealing conditions like these,\" says Garlick, a profes- sor of oral and maxillofacial pathology. \"That suggests that we have a lot of work to do.\"The challenges he and other pluripotent stem cell research- ers face, however, have often been mo re political than sci- entific. Until several years ago, the only way to ob tain such cells has been to h arvest them from human embryos that are several days old; those tiny balls of cells ultimately grow into muscle, nerves, skin and bone in the womb. Because embryos develop from fertilized human eggs, opponents of their use in research argue that scientists should not be allowed to w ork with them in the lab, a stance that has sparked heated debate over the embryo's role in the quest for stem cell therapies. Garlick's research, however, might allow scientists to s ide- step these moral conundrum s. Using a p rocess Japanese researchers developed in 2006, he and his team \"reboot\" cells multipurpose cel ls could act as biological repair kits to treat conditions that won't get better on their own by David Levinregenerationfrom freshly removed foreskins (yes, foreskins), forcing them to revert to a n embryonic cell-like state by adding four genes to the cells' DNA. The resulting cells, called induced pluripo- tent stem, acquire the ability to de velop again into different kinds of cells. \"These alternative cells are really at the crux of our scien- tific questions,\" says Garlick. \"Are induced pluripotent stem cells the equivalent to embry- onic stem cells in terms of their potential therapeutic value? Do they hold the same p romise for human therapies in the future?\" To find out, Garlick and his colleagues are trying to better understand some o f the biochemical processes that let the cells \"reboot\" in the first place. He says it all goes back to DNA\u2014or rather, the myriad ways that cells interpret DNA. Genetic Recipes As you may remember from high school biology, the infor- mation in a D NA mo lecule is a master plan for the entire body. It's a genetic cookbook of sorts\u2014inside, it contains recipes for creating bone cells, muscle cells, skin cells or any other type of cell. Somehow, though, in the face of all this raw information, cells know exactly where to s tart reading. A healthy liver cell homes in on recipes relevant to l iver cells, and a h ealthy nerve cell will focus only on recipes that make nerve cells. This selective reading of DNA is made possible by a biochemical control system where iDeas t ake root 8 tuft s me dicine fall 2013 PHOTO: IPSC CORE LAB/TUFTS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTAL MEDICINE a microscopic view of fibroblast cells grown from a patient's epigenome. Like a set of bookmarks, it high- lights certain sections of DNA, allowing specific genes to \"turn on\" as a cell devel- ops. The epigenome c an also \"mask\" parts of DNA, effec- tively turning those genes off. By selecting which genes can be activated at a given time, the system guides cells to develop into specific types. The epigenome is also key to creating induced pluripo- tent stem (iPS) cells. The four genes that Garlick's lab add to skin cells can rearrange these DNA \"bookmarks,\" making only specific parts of the DNA cookbook (the parts needed to make an embryonic-like cell) available for browsing. As a result, the cell is reprogrammed back to its original embryonic state. Understanding the epig- enome has big implications for understanding disease, Garlick notes. A p atient may have flaw- less DNA, but if his or her cells are reading it wrong, well, there are going to b e problems. He thinks these epigenetic glitches might cause some non-healing disorders\u2014and that iPS cells could offer a tantalizing cure. \"If we can understand the epigenome in iPS, we can think about using cells derived from them to t reat a chronic wound or periodontal gum de fect that doesn't heal, and potentially reverse those defects,\" he says. Although iPS cell therapy is promising, it's not yet a m agic bullet. Clinical trials, slated to begin in Japan by March 2014, haven't yet been app roved in the United States. The field is so new, Garlick notes, it's unclear whether iPS cells can be used in humans without compl ications. \"We have to b e 100 per- cent sure that any cell derived from an iPS won't give rise to a tumor,\" he says. \"That's going to be a b ig challenge to t he field.\" Garlick and his team are using tissues grown from iPS cells to s tudy diabetic foot ulcers in the lab. \"By using iPS-derived cells to engineer skinlike tissues, it's possible to examine the behavior and biology of diseases in ways we couldn't do i n humans,\" he says. \"Essentially, we have a surrogate for a human right on our lab bench.\" In a d ish filled with orange fluid, he points out a translucent, dime-sized puck. It's human skin tissue grown from iPS cells. Garlick's team is using it to examine how the cells might behave once transplanted into a p atient. By using tissues like these to g ain a deeper understanding of what makes new iPS-derived cells tick, Garlick says it may one day be possible to c reate a sort of biological \"repair kit\" to treat nonhealing diseases in the mo uth and throughout the body. \"Dental research like this contributes to an understand- ing of basic disease processes that are broadly relevant to t he entire body,\" he says. \"After all, our mission as dentist-scientists is to a dvance both oral and systemic health\u2014to reduce the burden of disease and to improve quality of life.\"in two r ecentLy published papers, researchers at Tufts School of Engineering, employing methods based on remote satellite imaging, have established new techniques for predicting the severity of seasonal cholera epidemics months before they occur. Taken together, findings from the two papers may provide the essential lead time to strengthen intervention efforts before the outbreak of cholera in endemic regions. Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It occurs in the spring and fall in the Bengal Delta of Bangladesh in southern Asia, where mo re than 125 million people inhabit one of the mo st fertile regions in the world. In earlier research, scientists have used chlorophyll, a surrogate for phytoplankton, as a rough me asuring stick for the presence of cholera. The cholera bacteria live and thrive among phytoplankton and zooplankton. In the June issue of Remote Sensing Letters, Antarpreet Jutla, then a do ctoral student at the School of Engineering and now an assistant professor at West Virginia University, was lead author on a study that me asured chlorophyll and other organic matter using a new, mo re precise app roach. The team, which was led by Shafiqul Islam, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts, used fall 2013 tuft s me dicine 9 PHOTO: BSIP/PHOTORESEARCHERS INC.satellite imagery may provide better warning of cholera epidemics by alexander reideye in the sky an image Vibrio cholerae, 2:24 PMas peopLe get older, fat tissue inevitably takes up residence in their muscles, but some o f that fat may be particularly damaging. A small study conducted at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts suggests that buildup of a fat molecule known as ceramide might play a l eading role in muscle deterioration in older adults. The study enrolled 10 me n in their mid-70s and nine men in their early 20s. None was overweight, and none had exercised in six mo nths. The researchers, including first author Donato Rivas, an HNRCA scientist, took muscle biopsies before and after the participants performed a single round of leg exercises to examine how the workout affected muscle growth. Their analysis showed that two types of ceramide molecules were higher in the older me n. \"We suspect that the increased storage of ceramide we saw in the older men, exacerbated by the presence of saturated fat, has a p art in weakening the anabolic signal- ing that responds to resistance exercises and helps with the assembly of new muscle,\" says Roger Fielding, N93, senior author and director of the HNRCA Nutrition, Exercise Physiology and Sarcopenia Laboratory. Learning more about ceramide activity through larger, long-term interventional trials may identify a role for dietary or therapeutic drug interventions in treating sarcopenia, an age- related condition of muscle loss and function. \"The deterioration of muscle is compounded by a loss of muscle strength, which really begins to de cline around age 50 and app ears to be a factor in the visible decrease in mob ility people exhibit around age 80,\" adds Fielding, who is also a p rofes- sor at the Friedman School of Nutrition. Previous research done at Tufts and other institutions suggests that even with limited exercise, older adults can maintain and build some n ew m uscle. \"Until there is enough research to develop specific exercise and dietary interventions, staying as physically active as deemed safe by your health-care pro- vider can only benefit aging muscle,\" Fielding says. The results of the study were published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.satellite data to me asure chlorophyll and algae as well as flora that also support growth of the cholera bacteria. With their satellite images, the researchers created a \"satellite water marker\" (SWM) index to e stimate the presence of organic matter, including chlorophyll and plankton, based on wavelength measurements. A predominance of green, plankton-rich water\u2014which is measured at 555 nanometers\u2014 indicated the degree to which the waters contained chlorophyll, plankton and other impurities. Clear blue water\u2014measured at 412 nanometers\u2014indicated low levels of these impurities, according to the researchers. The researchers targeted the spring epidemic, which is a coastal phenomenon caused by water flowing into the delta from three rivers, the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna. Unlike the spring outbreak, the fall epidemic is linked to flo oding, which follows the monsoons and subsequent breakdown of sanitary conditions rather than coastal conditions. In their study, the researchers correlated cholera incidence from the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research in Bangladesh from 1997 to 2010 with NASA satellite imaging data for the period. They discovered a relationship between SWM index me asurements taken in early winter\u2014from O ctober to December\u2014and the severity of cholera epidemics the following spring. \"In short, the index for chlorophyll along with readings for other biological matter in early winter indicated severity of cholera incidences in the spring,\" says Jutla. The SWM is a mo re accurate predictor of cholera than the algorithm that measures strictly chlorophyll levels, because it me asures a broader range of organic matter, Islam explains. \"The probability for error in this index-based estimate is less than 10 percent, while the error in using the chlorophyll-based algorithm is about 30 percent.\" To validate their hypothesis that the index can be used in coastal areas outside the Bengal Delta, the team app lied the SWM to coastal waters around Mozambique's capital city, Maputo, and found confirmation in the results.research 10 tuft s me dicine fall 2013 ILLUSTRATION : jULIETTE BORDAfat molecule m ay be a factor in mu scle decline as we age by Julie flahertypower loss 33638p08-11.indd 10 10/18/13 2:24 PMbeing even miLDLy deficient in vitamin B-12 may put older adults at a greater risk for accelerated cognitive decline, an ob servational study from the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts suggests. Martha Savaria Morris, an epidemiologist in the Nutrition Epidemiology Program at the HNRCA, and colleagues examined data from 549 men and women enrolled in a cohort of the Framingham Heart Study. The subjects, who had an average age of 75 at the start, were divided into five groups based on their vitamin B-12 blood levels. Being in the two lowest groups was associated with significantly accelerated cogni- tive decline, based on scores from dementia screening tests given over eight years. \"Men and women in the second- lowest group did not fare any better in terms of cognitive decline than those with the worst vitamin B-12 blood levels,\" Morris says. It is well known that severe B-12 defi- ciency speeds dementia, but the finding suggests that even more seniors may be affected. The study app eared in the Journal of the Am erican Geriatrics Society. \"While we emphasize our study does not show causa- tion, our associations raise the concern that some c ognitive decline may be the result of inadequate vitamin B-12 in older adults, for whom maintaining normal blood levels can be a challenge,\" says Paul Jacques, the study's senior author and director of the HNRCA Nutrition Epidemiology Program. Animal proteins, such as lean me ats, poultry and eggs, are good sources of vitamin B-12. Because older adults may have a h ard time a bsorb- ing vitamin B-12 from food, the USDA's 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans rec- ommend that people over age 50 incorporate foods fortified with B-12 or supplements in their diets. The subjects in this study were mo stly Caucasian women who had earned at least a high school diploma. The authors said future research might include mo re diverse popula- tions and explore whether vitamin B-12 status affects particular cognitive skills.b-12 deficiency and dementia fall 2013 tuft s me dicine 11 PHOTO: BSIP/PHOTORESEARCHERS INC.magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans of the brain of a 76-year-old patient with dementi a. the brain has shrunk, and the ventricles, the fluid-filled spaces (dark brown) at the center of the brain, have become enlarged. social stress not only impairs a m other's ability to care for her children; it can also hamper her daughters' ability to care for their future offspring, according to researchers at the cummings school of veterinary medicine at tufts. the scientists conducted a transgenerational study with female rats, examining the behavioral and physiological changes in mothers exposed to chronic social stress early in life. to create the stress, a different male rat was placed in the cages of first-generation mothers and their newborn pups for an hour a day for 15 days. consistent with earlier research, the moth- ers' behavior changed\u2014they were not as nurturing, produced less milk and experienced increased anxiety. the pups, too, witnessed the tension between their mothers and the male intruders. after reaching maturation, the second-generation females were mated and assessed against a control group where neither the moth- er nor her pups had been exposed to a m ale interloper. the daughters exhibited the same behaviors as their stressed-out moms. they also experienced increases in the stress hormone corticosterone and decreases in oxytocin and prolactin (important for maternal behavior and lactation) as well as the sex hormone estradiol. \"the endocrine and behavioral data are consistent with what has been reported in studies of depressed human mothers,\" says benjamin c. nephew, an assistant professor of biomedical sciences and principal investigator on the study, published in the september issue of Hormones and Behavior. \"the potential with this animal model is that it can be used to study new preventive measures and treatments for postpartum depression and anxiety, and the adverse effects of these disorders on offspring.\"vitamin shortage may affect more people than previously thought postpartum depression sp ans generations 33638p08-11.indd 11 10/18/13 2:24 PM O ur med ical school is stepping up its recruitment of foreign med ical graduates to fill re sidency slots in the Tufts hospital system sked to name a f ew places where his plane has touched down recently, the man in the trim, dark suit replies, \"India, Korea, South Africa, Australia. . .\" and keeps on going for another five or six countries without drawing a b reath. Tej Maini is a traveling man. As dean of international affairs at the me dical school, he is engaged in something like a p ermanent recruitment effort abroad. What he's seeking are the top-notch foreign me dical school graduates and researchers who are willing, able and eager to c ome to t he United States and extend their education within a n etwork of Tufts-affiliated hospitals. Most are coming for residencies and fellowships that last between one and seven years. Because American me dicine in 2013 is considered the world's gold standard, visiting students hope to pick up the latest developments in their respective fields while gaining the luster of U.S. training. In the case of some n ations, mo st nota- bly Saudi Arabia, the government pays all travel and living expenses for their me dical graduates who land residency positions abroad. Right now, Saudi Arabia lies at the heart of the contest among American medical schools. According to Maini, the oil-rich nation has committed to spending 25 percent of its GDP on higher education in the years to c ome. Naturally, the competition for that mo ney is fierce. \"If this is the pie,\" says Maini, holding his hands apart, \"there are many birds flying in to p eck at the pie.\" 12 tuft s me dicine fall 2013by bruce 10/18/13 3:00 13 A traveling man: Tej Maini near his Boston office 33638p12-15.indd 13 10/18/13 3:00 PMEach year roughly 25,000 residency slots are available in American hospitals and medical centers. Of these, about 20,000 are taken by graduates of U.S. medical schools, and the rest are filled by foreign medical school graduates. The total number of app licants increases every year, both from do mestic and foreign sources. Four new American medical schools recently graduated their first classes, adding about 1,000 students to the mix, and exist- ing U.S. medical schools are on track to boost enrollment by 30 percent, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). International medical students and graduates contributed 740 more residency applicants in 2013 than the previous year. Both the American Medical Association and the AAMC support bills introduced in Congress that would add s ome 15,000 Medicare-financed residency positions over four years, while reserving spots for special- ists in such critical-need areas as primary and geriatric care. Although 2013 was the most comp etitive ever for placements, this year's residency match rate was the highest in history, with 99.4 percent of positions filled, according to the National Residency Matching Program. Against this backdrop, the payoffs for U.S. hospitals in the placement of foreign medical students are considerable, Maini explains. Each resident would normally cost the hospital about $60,000 a y ear, including a monthly stipend and benefits. However, in the case of an app licant from a c ountry like Saudi Arabia, this cost disappears. By agreeing to \"sponsor\" an app licant, Saudi Arabia pays the hospital directly, which in turn funds the resident. It's basic arithmetic. The more state-sponsored foreign residents a hospital can attract, the more the budget- friendly gains accrue. Each year, Maini and his staff of four typically place about 20 foreign residents among a n etwork of 10 Tufts-affiliated hospitals. Tufts Medical Center (TMC), St. Elizabeth's Medical Center and Baystate Medical Center generally do minate the field. In 2013, of 98 total placements\u2014 including those admitted in previous years\u2014the three giants claimed 42, 19 and 14 residents, respectively. For each resident placed, the sponsor provides a p ayment to Tufts Medical School in compensation. Attracting the app licants is not as easy as it sounds. Maini, who was born in India but trained in Boston, spends much of his life on the road, visiting foreign countries and attempting to cultivate the relationships that may yield dividends later. \"International business is a slow business,\" he says. \"It takes from five to 10 years to build a r elationship, and unless you are aware of the nuances, you are likely to s tumble.\" Maini, a v ascular surgeon, knows the ropes as well as any outsider can. Between 2008 and 2011, when he was employed by the Cleveland Clinic in a m anagerial role, he helped de velop the organization's inter- national expansion strategy. This included creating a n ew, world-class hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, from scratch. Before that, while serving as president and CEO of Fallon Health and leading a d ramatic turnaround in the fortunes of that health- care insurer based in central Massachusetts, he traveled abroad frequently to explore the endless cultural variations of global health.That experience lends Maini a h eight- ened sensitivity to what foreign-born stu- dents see when they glance toward the horizon. \"International medical students do n ot understand the U.S. medical sys- tem,\" he says with the voice of experience, \"and so you have to walk them through every step.\" Examples? \"If you say there's a $ 100 fee for the app lication, they do n't send it in. They're in a d ifferent mind-set,\" Maini says. \"If you ask for a p hoto with the app lication, you have to say what kind of photo is app ro- priate. We've had people sending in shots of themselves in tank tops.\" Maini's office takes app licants by the hand and leads them through the hoops of securing visas, tak- ing and passing required medical licensing exams and settling into their new culture. Deeply embedded cultural biases may need some a djustment. Those from tradi- tional Middle Eastern cultures are often not comfortable being asked to r eport to w omen, for example. Nurses may be considered sub- ordinates by them, \"whereas here in this country, we consider nurses to be our col- leagues,\" says Maini. It helps that the medical school's Office of International Affairs resembles a m ini- United Nations. Among them, the five staff- ers speak seven languages-Arabic, English, French, Spanish, Urdu, Hindi and Punjab. Collectively, they have earned de grees in the United St ates, India, France and Morocco. All of this far-flung expertise adds up to human sympathy of a v aluable kind. \"Coming to this country was not so much a c ulture shock for me, because I came from a v ery progressive family,\" Maini observes. \"But I do k now what someone goes through when he or she enters another country for training. It takes a w hile getting used to i t.\" In the year that Maini has been in charge, he has sought to professionalize the office\u2014by improving the quality of its web- site, among other mo ves\u2014 and broaden its reach. Of the current crop of foreign resi- dents and scholars that he has brought to Tufts, almost all hail from a c oncentrated area of countries in the Middle East. Lately, more and mo re, Maini is booking flights to other regions of the world, noting, \"I'm try- ing to d iversify the portfolio.\" 14 tuft s me dicine fall 2013 1,000 more U.S. allopathic medical school seniors and applicants from existing U.S. medical schools that have increased class sizes 816 more U.S. citizen students and graduates from international medical schools 740 more non-U.S. citizen international medical students and graduatesBreaking Do wn the 2013 national Match Compared with 2012, there were: SOURCE: NatiONal RESidENCy MatChiNg PROgRaM1,000 1,200 800 600 400 200 0 40,335 the total number of match applications, the highest ever 99.4% Match rate, the highest ever 317 more osteopathic students and graduates 33638p12-15.indd 14 10/18/13 3:00 PMfall 2013 tuft s me dicine 15elite training For foreign medical graduates at Tufts who have waved goodbye to one continent and traveled thousands of miles to another in search of self-advancement, the journey sounds well worth the dislocation. Abdulaziz Madani, 28, is a p rime e xam- ple. He says he heard positive things about Tufts Medical Center from friends back home in Saudi Arabia and de cided to heed their advice. He's now a r esident in de rma- tology at TMC and living in Boston with his wife, Nujud Daham, an intern in the surgery/ dermatology program at TMC. The two met in medical school at King Saud University in Riyadh on a de rmatology rotation. As Madani puts it wryly, \"It's been dermatology all the way w ith us.\" Neither member of this pair is the wide- eyed newcomer you might expect. Madani was born in Fairfax, Va., and spent every summer in the United States, frequently accompanying his father on trips to Texas for his dad's medical treatment at a facility in Houston. For her part, Daham first came to B oston as a me dical student in 2009 to take an elective at Harvard Medical School; she loved the city and vowed to return as soon as she could. Both husband and wife attest that ven- turing to t he United St ates for me dical training remains a de sirable option, w ith considerable prestige. \"People in Saudi Arabia face a tough choice when they gradu- ate from me dical school,\" Madani explains. They generally need, first, to identify and then be admitted to a h igh-quality me dical training program either in the United States or Canada if they are serious about bolster- ing their careers. \"Going to the U.S. has that reputation,\" he says. Daham comments that, compared with educational app roaches back home, the United States stands apart. Saudi Arabia uses a pure lecture style in the classroom, abetted by copious handouts of printed material, akin to what American medical schools might have been do ing 30 or 40 years ago. \"Here they teach you to s elf-educate,\" she says. \"You have to look up everything they are teaching you, which helps you to understand.\" Ibrahim Abushoshah, a surgical resident at Tufts Medical Center, sees another distinc- tion. \"The advancements are better estab- lished here,\" he asserts. When he returns home in a f ew years, after completing his first-rate training, the Saudi government will expect him to act as a teaching assistant at a local medical school\u2014to \"pay it forward,\" in effect\u2014for a term equal to the number of years spent abroad on the nation's dime. For now, Madani and Daham live in an apartment a b lock or two away from Tufts Medical Center and are swept u p in the frenzied schedule that a do uble regimen of medical training entails. They have a o ne- year-old son who's momentarily caught between cultures, absorbing and transcend- ing them bit by bit, just as his parents are. \"He was born here,\" his mo ther comments, before adding with a laugh, \"and he's grow- ing into it.\" tm Bruce Morgan, the editor of this magazine, can be reached at bruce.morgan@tufts.edu.

When the fac- ulty members of his newly forged de partment got together for their first few me etings, people were striking up conversations about their shared research interests and that simply hadn't occurred before. Many were connecting for the first time. Tufts Medical School is a large, sprawling research enterprise, and it's difficult for anyone to be aware of everything that's going on. A n ew top-to-bottom reorganization of the school may help eliminate some of the critical distances and generate more naturally occurring synergies of the kind that Hinds witnessed. The new organizational plan took effect on July 1 u nder the leader- ship of Dean Harris Berman, and Hinds is ready for the change. \"We want to take advantage of the opportunities to sit down and talk to each other more frequently and find out where the connections are,\" says Hinds, formerly a p rofessor of radiation oncology. \"I don't think there has been an optimal number of collisions and interactions.\" His new de partment, where he now serves as professor and interim chair, is called the Department of Developmental, Molecular and Chemical Biology, or DMCB for short. It consists of members of the former departments of biochemistry, pathology, physiology and pharmacology, and anatomy. 33638p16-18.indd 17 10/18/13 3:04 PMTo improve the odds of uncovering links, Hinds is sponsoring \"short-talk\" semi- nars within DMCB every Friday afternoon, w hen department members get the chance to de scribe their research passions in a n utshell. Of course, the men and women in his audience weren't totally out of touch previously; they all had a c er- tain amount of convergence with each other over shared interests\u2014through what Hinds jokingly terms \"leaky silos.\" But the goal at Tufts School of Medicine is to de molish those silos in the mo nths and years ahead. better Funding Model It's been a w hile coming. Since the release of the landmark Flexner Re port in 1910 that critically assessed the state of U.S. medical education, m edi- cal schools have been organized around de part- ments designed for effective teaching of medical students, Berman explains. In the century since then, even as medical instruction has assumed a new shape and form, the old patterns remained. \"There has been a s hift from teaching to research with these de partments, yet the organizational model stayed the same,\" Berman says. This outmoded scheme has hampered the cross-disciplinary forms of research that increas- ingly yield breakthroughs and win grant app roval, notes the de an. (\"If you're looking for grants through the National Cancer Institute, times are brutal,\" Hinds confirms. \"Group efforts fare better.\") Over the past year or so, working in consultation with the medi- cal faculty in a s eries of often-spirited meetings, Berman has essen- tially shuffled the institutional deck and distributed the cards in a pattern mo re reflective of the way that catalytic research is carried out and supported in a t ime o f ever mo re stringent funding. The dean cites cancer research as one example of today's natu- rally dissolving boundaries. \"Cancer doesn't fit i n any one depart- ment,\" he says. \"Instead, it fits into many departments. I've worked with the faculty to ask what will research look like 15 or 20 years from now, and how should we be organized to prepare for that?\" The resulting scheme is pragmatic at its core. As Berman sees it, \"We need to f ocus as a me dical school and be world class in every- thing we do.\" The seven basic science departments that were in place when Berman assumed the deanship three-and-a-half years ago have been trimmed to four\u2014the existing neuroscience and microbiol- ogy departments (two longstanding powerhouses of the medical school) and two newly configured ones. In the first, the DMCB, the emphasis will be largely on cancer. \"Cancer is a m ajor theme o f the department, but not an exclusive focus,\" Hinds points out. It will be home to 24 t enured faculty me mbers. Laura Liscum, formerly professor of molecular physiology and pharmacology, will act as interim chair of the sec- ond, newly christened Department of Integrative Physiology and Pathobiology (IPP), organized around efforts to understand inflammation and its effects. \"We are finding that inflammation is a problem that underlies all chronic disease that we get as we age,\" she says. That department will house 29 faculty me mbers. Two permanent chairs plus eight new faculty members, divided between DMCB and IPP, are to be hired in the near future. In both cases, the departmental labels, DMCB and IPP, reflect a broad spectrum of app roaches to pursue a s ingle theme. A n ewly formed Division of Medical Education, led by Associate Professor Peter Brodeur and organizationally part of the IPP, will be home to faculty who are devoted full time to teaching as opposed to r esearch. Separately, individual faculty members within IPP have studied arthritis, autoimmune disor- ders, birth defects, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious pathology, metabolic and neurolo gi- cal disease, obesity, reproductive disorders and wound healing. Now, joined around what Liscum calls \"a core thread of effort,\" they will be explor- ing the inflammatory response and the regenera- tion and repair mechanisms that restore normal functioning to damaged tissue. \"There are some diseases where inflammation plays a m ajor role and others where it plays a m inor role,\" she says. \"But if we can attack it, we can have an influence on the disease.\" Li Zeng is a g ood example of how fertile new collaborations within her department will likely pay dividends. Zeng, an associate professor trained as a cell biologist, has been examining strategies to prevent the degeneration of cartilage that leads to i nflammation and arthritis. Formerly, she was surrounded by other cell biolo- gists. Now, as a m ember of IPP, she rubs shoulders with immu- nologists, including Stephen Bunnell and Sasha Poltorak, who are studying the cells that cause the inflammation. Liscum sees this as a perfect me sh of research interests. For his part, Hinds ascribes the value o f the new de partmental template to something that extends beyond the neatness of two puzzle pieces clicking together on a tabletop\u2014to the cognitive pro- cesses behind the display. \"The way people think about their fields is sufficiently different that you tend to g et mo re insights when you bring these fields together,\" says Hinds. \"It becomes very useful to mix them. Everything overlaps,\" he adds, in a c omment that could be a s uccinct summary for everything in motion at the medical school these days, \"and yo u have to be open to using every disci- pline you can to solve the question in front of you.\" tm Bruce Morgan, the editor of this magazine, can be reached at bruce. morgan@tufts.edu. photos (top to bottom): kathleen dooher, alonso nichols, joanie tobin 18 tuft s me dicine fall 2013 19photographs by alonso n ichols Si nce 2007, medical faculty have been working with Boston high school teachers to capture kids' attention and g et them excited about science by jacqueline Mitchell 33638p19-21.indd 19 10/25/13 7:13 AM20 tuft s me are loving the neuro unit,\" says Puopolo, an East Boston High alumna who has taught chemistry there for 17 years. \"What they like about it is that it relates to them. They want to know all about their own brains,\" she says. That's music to Berri Jacque's ears. Jacque, a research assistant professor in the School of Medicine's developmental, molec- ular and chemical biology department, has a Ph.D. in immunology. But since 2007, he's been working with Karina Meiri, a p rofes- sor of developmental, molecular and chemi- cal biology at Tufts, and the Boston teachers to de vise this alternative curriculum. Part of the NIH-funded Gr eat Diseases Project, the curriculum is designed to expand stu- dents' scientific literacy in the so-called \"great diseases\"\u2014infectious disease, neu- rological disorders, metabolic disease and cancer\u2014all topics teenagers may have had some e xperience with. The lessons give students a de eper under- standing of scientific principles, such as com- ing up with research questions and devising appropriate experiments to fi nd the answers. But the program's main goal is to get kids engaged with science by making it more rel- evant to t heir own lives. \"If you ask students if they like science, they may say 'no' because they have this whole image of science and research,\" says Jacque. \"But if I ask them about infectious diseases, they say, 'Absolutely. Fantastic.' They do n't realize it's the same, because they come to you with 15 years of bad sci- ence experience.\" During the last school year, the infec- tious-diseases course was taught to almost 400 students in 10 different schools\u2014some of them outside M assachusetts. Meiri and Jacque expect to reach another 500 students this year. This fall, almost 200 kids have signed up for the elective classes at Boston Latin School and East Boston High School, doubling last year's enrollment. There's evi- dence that this real-world app roach to t each- ing science is a successful one. The team surveyed the teachers and the students about their knowledge and atti- tudes about science before and after each course. Unsurprisingly, both teachers and students learned a lot from the curriculum. But more important, both groups' confi- dence in their ability to master the material, what the researchers call \"self-efficacy,\" rose dramatically. The results were published in the journal Academic Medicine in May.stocking the pipeline It's no secret that American students are fall- ing far behind their international peers in science and math. In 2009, U.S. school stu- dents ranked 25th in math and 17th in sci- ence among students from 34 industrialized nations. A 2 012 study revealed that just 7 percent of U.S. eighth-graders take advanced math, compared to nearly 50 percent of their peers in Singapore and South Korea. These aren't just embarrassing sta- tistics; they translate to real losses\u2014not just of innovation and discovery, but to the U.S. economy, too. Despite the cur- rent high unemployment rate, tech-sector employers compl ain they can't find quali- fied candidates to hire. That's why STEM education\u2014short for science, technolo gy, engineering and math\u2014has become a p ri- ority for universities, business leaders and even the White House. Meiri has been do ing her part to get more Boston high school kids into the sci- ence pipeline since she arrived at Tufts in 2000. Every summer, she has invited stu- dents, often from the Boston Latin School, which her daughters attended, to try their hand at research in her lab. But Meiri soon recognized that only a c ertain kind of stu- dent would even seek such an opportunity. \"I realized I w as only getting kids who were already interested in science,\" she says. \"Unless you get teachers involved, you're not going to have any impact on the rest of the class.\" So in 2009, with money from a N ational Institutes of Health's Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA), Meiri and Jacque convened nine scientists from Tufts and 10 science teachers from Boston's two largest public high schools, Madison Park Technical and Vocational High School and the Boston Latin School. Tackling the infectious- diseases curriculum first, the researchers brought the teachers up to speed on the sub- ject matter. Then, working together, the Tufts team and the teachers devised a c ourse that would translate to a h igh school classroom. \"The key thing was the way we set it up as a partnership between the teachers and us,\" says Jacque. \"It took a w hile to establish that bidirectional relationship.

It's the first day of an edu- cational unit on addictive behaviors, part of an intensive neuroscience curriculum de signed by Tufts medical school faculty in collaboration with Boston public high school teachers. The kids work in small groups, considering how substances like marijuana, heroin, nicotine and alcohol affect the brain. The exercise introduces them to t he brain's anatomy as well as the neurotransmitters and circuitry that control it. They're tossing around phrases such as \"dopamine blocker\" and \"synaptic signaling\" like actors in a T V me dical drama.

She was among the first to roll out the infec- tious disease mo dule in her classroom. \"Piloting it and getting that content has been great. I've learned so much along the way. Before I h ad to research topics myself,\" she says. \"Having this intensive, professional development in content has been outstanding. It sounds hokey, but this never would have been possible without the collaboration between Tufts and the Boston public schools.\" CritiCal thinkers Today, Gauthier's class at Boston Latin is wrapping up the me tabolism unit. For their final projects, the students have teamed up to take a c loser look at some popular fad diets. Three girls head to the front of the classroom to report on what they've learned about Dr. Siegal's Cookie Diet, which entails eating nine \"specially formulated\" cookies a day, plus a reasonably sized dinner. The claim is that the cookies contain special proteins that satiate dieters' hunger and he lp them stay on the strict 1,000- to 1,200-calorie-per-day diet. That's so few calories, the students point out, that the diet actively discourages people from e xercis- ing. The girls also note that the cookies plus one me al each day are unlikely to contain a wide enough variety of vitamins and m in- erals, so a p erson on this diet would have to take supplements, which, conveniently, Dr. Siegal also sells on his website. \"If you were a n utritionist,\" Gauthier asks the girls, \"would you recommend this diet to your patients?\" The girls all say no. Eating nothing but cookies all day is unrealistic, they say, and they're bothered by the lack of exercise. But , worse, the Internet-savvy teens couldn't find any primary sources\u2014no p eer-reviewed research\u2014to back up the diet's claims. For Jacque, who observed the presen- tation from t he back of the classroom, it's like hitting the jackpot. Another major goal of the G reat Diseases Project is to give students the tools to make decisions about their own health based on solid evidence. Whether the subject is sexually trans- mitted diseases, drug abuse or diet, \"we're not telling them what to do,\" says Jacque. \"We're trying to create mo re critical think- ers and readers.\" Jacque hopes the c urrent interest in STEM education will me an mo re inter- est\u2014and funding\u2014for the fledgling cur- riculum. But , like many federal agen- cies, the N ational Institutes of Health is slashing budgets, including that of SEPA, which provided the initial grant for the Great Diseases Project. The team recently secured a g rant from the N IH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease that will support more work with the infec- tious disease curriculum. Jacque believes the time is right to reengineer science edu- cation, given that the private sector's inter- est in STEM has nev er been higher. \"If we'd started this 10 years ago, it wouldn't have worked,\" he s ays. \"I hope five years from no w brings amazing things.\" tm Jacqueline Mitchell, a senior health sciences writer in Tufts' Office of Publications, can be reached at jacqueline.mitchell@tufts.edu.

Instead of talking about reagents and cata- lysts and her recent findings from a s eries of carefully controlled experiments con- ducted in a lab, and leaving it there, this Argentine native with the lush dark bangs crooks her head toward the ceiling tiles in her small, cramped office and says things like \"What is the self?\" and \"How do w e know what we know?\" This is different. Soto, a professor within the Department of Integrative Physiology and Pathobiology (IPP), cites Kant, Newton, D arwin, G alileo and Einstein in rapid succession, tossing off each name with an easy sense of familiarity, periodically tap- ping out points of emphasis on her desk and now and then flashing a w ide, disarming, altogether unexpected and innocent smile. Her mind, leaping agilely from realm to realm, moves from the microscopic to the celestial and back again, de termined to encompass and comprehend it all. She gives the quick impression of someone who is not easily satisfied. What's perturbing her the mo st these days? Soto's main complaint is that the linear, deterministic computer models that grew out of our cultural fascination with genetic code, beginning with the discovery of the DNA structure in the early 1950s, are no longer serving us well as explainers and predictors of modern biology. This leaves a y awning void. Although those old models may be flawed, no better alternative theoretical mo del has yet emerged to m ake sense of things. Our old theoretical models in biology are no t working so well lately, says Ana Soto. She is determined to find something better.the contrarian Ana Soto 33638p22-27.indd 23 10/18/13 3:15 PM\"Right now biologists have trouble inter- preting the reams of data they are getting,\" Soto says, adding this state of affairs repre- sents a \"crisis\" in mainstream biology. Her sense of crisis is not widely shared, she readily concedes. Most biologists who encounter discrepancies or unexpected results in their experiments tend to shrug off the anomalies, she says, happy they will all make sense some day in the future. \"So much of what's taken as knowledge in biol- ogy is not because there's a lot of evidence in its favor; it's just because people think that way,\" Soto asserts. She counts herself among \"a small world of people who think there is something we need to do u rgently to c hange that.\" First and foremost in this camp, she mentions Carlos Sonnenschein, a c olleague within IPP who was her postdoctoral men- tor and with whom she has worked in part- nership over the past 40 years. Denis Noble, a retired British professor of cardiovascular physiology at the University of Oxford, is another scientist who proposes a change of perspective. In his 2008 book The Music of Life: Biology Beyond Genes, Noble argues for app roaching the human organism as a complex system of interactions in which genes play a subservient role. \"He tells us that, based on his experience, something is miss- ing in our current explanations,\" Soto says. Scott Gilbert is a third believer. A de velop- mental biologist and professor at Swarthmore College, he has known Soto for the past 15 years and de eply respects the integrity of her thinking. He offers some perspective on Soto's notion of a crisis in biology. \"Her crisis is a different crisis from what mo st biologists would talk about,\" he explains. While other biologists may identify the crisis in their field in limited terms, such as the me ager funding they are getting, or the lack of app reciation of their work among members of the general public, \"Ana is saying there is a crisis in the science of biology. She has seen things that can't be explained in the usual manner.\" Soto and her partners are intent on developing a n ew way of looking at things\u2014 a \"theory of organisms\"\u2014that covers and explains all the biological bases, including the quirks, deviations and anomalies. \"We want to know what happens in the biology of an organism from embryonic develop- ment to de ath,\" says Soto, who starts by rejecting the simplicity of the current para- digm. \"The idea that the genome is the Tree of Life is not true,\" she says. Charles Darwin represents something of an intellectual model for Soto in the way that his theory of evolution, once found, explained so much of what had formerly been scattered and incomprehensible. Gilbert uses the example of a human arm compared with a bird's wing. \"You could say the arm of a human is like the wing of a bird,\" he suggests. \"But now, if you have evolutionary theory, it makes perfect sense. Darwin didn't change the data, but his theory gave the data new meaning. That's what Ana is looking for.\" Luckily, the Tufts biologist has been given some time to explore a f ew of these ques- tions. Soto has been selected as one of four Blaise Pascal Chairs at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, beginning this fall. She will be in residence on a p art-time basis over the next two years, commuting back and forth to Boston and maintaining her full teaching and research life at Tufts for the duration of her honorary designation. She will be working in partnership with Sonnenschein; Giuseppe Longo, a m athe- matics professor at the \u00c9cole and an adjunct professor at Tufts; plus a selection of other scholars from Paris and Toulouse. In her role as Pascal Chair, Soto will be hosting semi- nars of invited guests, conducting research and giving frequent talks of her own. Since its inception, in 1996, the Pascal Chair has been occupied by an array of dis- tinguished thinkers divided between the sci- ences and the humanities. Previous laureates include a s mattering of Nobel Prize winners. Last year's occupant of the biology chair, Elizabeth Blackburn, was a recipient of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The \u00c9cole itself, while perhaps little known among me mbers of the general pub- lic, dates from the 1790s, when it was cre- ated in the hopeful aftermath of the French Revolution, and is generally ranked among the most elite institutions of higher learn- ing in the world. Its compact main home is a small, leafy enclave wedged in next to the Sorbonne on the Left Bank, right at the heart of French intellectualism. Pascal, for whom the chair is named, was one of the intellectual giants of 17th-century France. A scientist, mathematician and philosopher, he was born in a French provincial town. His father, who educated him at home, for- bade Pascal to study mathematics, fearing this would distract him from the classics. One day D ad dis- covered his son scratching triangu- lar shapes on the floor of his room; Pascal had deduced basic principles of geometry through his own rea- soning power. As a teenager, the boy built a w ooden calculating device to help his father, a tax col- lector, on his daily rounds that today is con- sidered one of the first computers. The year was app roximately 1650. In later life Pascal got interested in philosophy and began jo tting do wn his thoughts for a v olume o f observations that eventually became h is Pens\u00e9es. In a r andom sample (\"All men's miseries derive from not being able to sit in a q uiet room alone\"), you can de tect the Gallic shrug, still much in evidence in cafes, classrooms and public squares throughout France.

Besotted writ- ers, brainy artists and philosophers have been going to Paris forever, each determined in his or her own way to redraw the map of human perception. What are the chances that Soto w ill succeed in her quest? \"She's picked a g rand goal, to revolutionize biol- ogy,\" Swarthmore's Gilbert answers slowly. \"If she can pull it off, well . . . \" His voice bears a m ix of skepticism and wonder. the big picture Ana Soto grew up in a m iddle-class family on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina. She earned an M.D. at the University of Buenos Aires in 1970 and practiced briefly as an emergency room physician before migrating to Tufts Medical School as a cancer researcher in 1973. Medical practice didn't quite ring her chime. \"I could be a do ctor, but I'm interested in ideas, so I b ecame a n academic,\" she says matter-of-factly. Despite her considerable prominence as a biologist, Soto never pur- sued an advanced degree in the field. Her personal interests have led her in many directions, including the research sectors of developmental biology, oncol- ogy, physiology and toxicology. (\"That's an unusual combination,\" Gilbert points out.) A glance at Soto's CV leaves the impression of a restless seeker who's traveled far and wide to absorb, distill and dispense ideas. In recent decades she has been a v isiting professor in Spain, N orway, France and the United Kingdom, often repeatedly and at different schools within the same c ountry. She clearly likes to g et around. If anything, all this global exposure has reinforced a central, ever-more-fixed convic- tion of Soto's\u2014that the computer modeling still so much in vogue do es not work as well as it should in biology. \"The problem with the computer is that it's totally deterministic,\" she begins. \"If DNA works like a c omputer, the way we used to believe back in 1960, informa- tion will go do wn to RNA and proteins with extreme precision\u2014one gene, one mRNA, one protein\u2014all determined with total cer- tainty. But mRNA is edited, and thus a piece of DNA, say a gene, does not correspond to a unique R NA. Due to s plicing, one gene could be transcribed into several mRNAs. \" There's instability there. Soto points out that philosophers were the first to n otice just how the deterministic models in biol- ogy were flawed. The public at large has certainly not gotten the news. Gilbert observes that people seem to love the idea of a biological determinism built into our DNA and driving us forward on our respective personal paths. \"We have really latched on to t he concept that the genes are what define you,\" he says. Gilbert cites examples from a s eries of American automo- tive ad campaigns that he says he has shown his college classes to illustrate the premise. BOSTON 33638p22-27.indd 25 10/18/13 3:15 PM26 tuft s me dicine fall 2013A recent ad for a mo re compact version of the Hummer carries the tagline \"Same DNA, smaller chromosomes\" (which means nothing biologically, Gilbert notes) to indi- cate the vehicle contains the same essence as the larger version, just in a t idier package. Another ad, for the Jeep Compass, highlights the virtue of the vehicle by saying simply, \"It's in the genes.\" A t hird ad, this time for the Kia Sportage, claims that the newest version of the compact SUV has been \"genetically modified.\" The me ssage is so prevalent in our culture that we scarcely notice it any mo re. Both Soto and Gilbert observe that recent findings of unpredictability in genetic devel- opment tend to Soto cites \"bursts of gene expression\" that indicate deviation from a straight-line mo del. \"We are finding that environment can direct gene expression,\" Gilbert elaborates. \"In many cases, bacteria are telling the genes of our body what to do .\" Emerging research in this area, including the U.S. government's $173 million Human Microbiome Project, hints at the sheer com- plexity of these interactions, where the col- lective genes of the microbiome are said to outnumber human genes by mo re than a hundred to one. \"We've use the old model for 50 years now, but if the old mo del is not working, well, you have to drop it,\" Soto remarks, her dark eyes flashing. \"We can continue crunching the numbers, but this will not translate into a b etter understanding of biological organization. It's not technolo gy that's going to solve the problem. It's going to require our thinking in a d ifferent way.\" Over the past decade, she says, there has been a g rowing recognition of this need. The crux of the problem is complexity. How do yo u handle complexity within a fie ld like biology as the old, simple models seem- ingly lose their relevance? \"These models have served us well, but not on every scale,\" says Soto. In physics, which she cites in coun- terpoint, there are several theories app lied to phenomena occurring at different scales. Physicists aim at unifying these theories, not reducing them to a s ingle iteration. \"Every electron is identical,\" Soto remarks. Physics has an advantage that way. In biology, Soto says, the presumptions shift. Every cell division results in two (slightly) different cells. \"In biology, variation is cen- tral,\" is how Soto puts it. In their experi- ments, biologists are removing variables \"that are inherent to biology,\" she continues. \"But in the big picture, this is not a problem of experiments. This is a p roblem of ideas.\" outliers anD pioneers You've got to admire anyone who stands apart from the mainstream, holds fast to certain principles and mo ves on from there. Soto has a long history of being iconoclas- tic in her scientific w ork, proceeding to the theoretical plane only after reviewing the evidence in front of her eyes. A prime example would be the findings outlined in her 1999 book The Society of Cells, coauthored with Sonnenschein, in which the authors proposed a b old new theory of can- cer. \"The somatic mutation theory of carci- nogenesis has been the dominant force driv- ing cancer research during the 20th century,\" Soto begins in describing her research inter- ests on her current CV. \"This theory places carcinogenesis at the cellular and subcellular hierarchical levels of biological complexity. Its basic premises are: (1) cancer is a de fect of the control of cell proliferation and (2) the default state of metazoan cells is quiescence.\" In the next line Soto takes a swing of her bat and drives the ball deep into left field. \"Those two premises,\" she writes, \"are con- tradicted by evidence.\" In their book, after examining all the evidence, Sonnenschein and Soto proposed a n ew theory of carcino- genesis. \"We got persuaded,\" Soto tells me in her office, \"that cancer is a problem of tis- sues, not of individual cells.\" Gilbert helps explain how the pair pro- ceeded. \"Ana and Carlos start by saying there are three or four things we are assum- ing in the way w e app roach cancer, and then showing how those assumptions are wrong,\" he relates. \"The standard thinking about cancer says that cancer occurs when cells proliferate. But, as they point out, cells want to divide n aturally. The standard thinking says cancer cells show m otility. But non- motility of cells is what's abnormal. The standard thinking says that cancer cells are cells that have 'gone bad.' But what often occurs is a complex set of interactions out of which a b ad environment forms. This poor environment can allow neighboring cells, with their inherent potentials for prolifera- tion and migration, to b ecome t umors.\" Given her book's unexpected viewpoint, how was The Society of Cells received by the scientific community? \"Well, we got reviews there and there,\" Soto answers a b it hesitantly, naming a few professional jour- nals. \"One review said our book had already become a n underground classic.\" With that last statement, pride suffuses her face for a moment and is gone. Soto is not a p rideful person by any me ans, but she is anchored by an inner core of steady belief in herself that drives her forward through the crosswinds. There are plenty of those to go around. Soto and Sonnenschein have advanced their careers side by side according to their own best instincts, ignoring the general popularity of their views and letting the results of their experiments fall where they will. \"We may be outliers in some w ays,\" Soto admits, unfazed by the term, \"but on the other hand, with endocrine disruption, we are also pioneers.\" Soto inves- tigating endocrine disruptors, comp ounds that interfere with the normal cascade o f chemical signals in the body, for more than 20 years now.

Once the subjects reach adulthood, they tend to show decreased fertility, certain altered behaviors, obesity and an increased predisposition to mammary cancer. The additive is widely used in baby bottles, eyeglass lenses, cell phones, water bottles, CDs and DVDs and household appliances, as well as in industrial resins and epoxies. An earlier study had revealed that BPA can be found in 95 percent of Americans' bodies. By exposing fetal mice to BPA, Soto and Sonnenschein de termined that very small doses of the chemical\u2014of the same m agni- tude that people routinely encounter\u2014were responsible for significant morphological changes in the mice's mammary glands, which later showed an increased propensity to mammary cancer. These findings effectively upended the conventional wisdom that the amount of BPA in the environment occurred at levels too low to affect human health. The two collaborators are now ranked among the world's top experts on endocrine disruption. mixing things up Soto may be going to Paris, but it's not to sip wine in a fashionable caf\u00e9 or watch long, tapered boats glide along the Seine at dusk. She is going there to turn the world of biol- ogy upside do wn. As Gilbert puts it suc- cinctly, \"We have a language of reduction- ism, and that language is not sufficient to give us a three-dimensional organism. We need a language of compl exity.\"The prevailing mode of think- ing about biology these days is \"bottom up,\" according to Gilbert. In effect, we know about the genes and their influence on the cells that create organisms. Our think- ing moves from small to large. \"What Ana and a f ew others are working on is the other direction, from the organism back do wn to the genes,\" Gilbert suggests. Viewed historically, Soto's search is occurring within a t ra- dition of inquiry called \"holism,\" says the Swarthmore biologist, who has taught the history of sci- ence at his college for de cades. \"This is the idea that the whole precedes the parts, which goes back to Kant and is counterin- tuitive. In this way o f thinking, the identity of every part is deter- mined by the whole. That is to s ay, parts can have multiple me an- ings, and what they're meaning becomes fixed by the whole.\" An example that Gilbert has deployed for dramatic effect mo re than once in the classroom uses the beguiling newspaper headline \"Prostitutes Appeal to the Pope.\" Is this a revelation of hidden per- sonal desire or something more officious and bland concerning a group of workers' united plea to be recog- nized by the papacy in some way? Context determines everything. In Paris, Soto plans to mix things up fearlessly in her hunt for big answers by including a p hysicist, a m athematician, two philosophers and two biologists (i.e., Sonnenschein and her) on her investiga- tive team. \"That will give us the chance to think about things from different perspec- tives,\" she relates matter-of-factly, as though she were planning a d inner party among friends. Her scope is long term, spread out over many years. Naturally, it will take everyone a w hile to get fully settled in the new m ilieu. \"Then,\" she says, \"we will see if all this theoretical talk has any bearing on the concept of me tamorphosis.\" tm Bruce Morgan is the editor of this magazine. photo: melody ko fall 2013 tuft s me dicine 27most biologists who encounter discrepancies in their experiments t end to shrug off the anomalies, soto says, happy they will all make sense some day in the future.Carlos Sonn enschein and Soto have been colleagues and collaborators for the past 40 years. 33638p22-27.indd 27 10/23/13 7:49 PM28 tuft s me dicine throws many curveballs. some even end up beaning us. How we respond, Ronald Pies says, is what makes the difference between a c ontented life and one filled with anger, sorrow and despair. You might expect Pies, a psychiatrist and clinical professor at the medical school, to recommend therapy to help me diate life's difficulties. But in his new book, The Three- Petalled Rose (iUniverse, 2013), he offers a d ifferent path to hap- piness based on practical advice from Judaism, Buddhism and Stoicism. He pulls together strands from the three traditions to make the case that wisdom comes in many forms that are acces- sible to all. Pies has addressed two of those traditions in other books, including his introduction to Stoicism, Everything Has Two Handles: The Stoic's Guide to the Art of Living (Hamilton Books), and a g uide to the ethics of the Talmud, Becomin g a Mensch: Timeless Talmudic Ethics for Everyone (Hamilton Books), the collection of commentary on the Torah. In his latest book, he weaves them together with Buddhism to pro- vide, as the book's subtitle suggests, counsel for \"a healthy, fulfilled and flo urishing life.\" He first summarizes each disci- pline, and then uses examples from composites of his patients to illustrate how the different traditions app roach everyday problems. In the end, though two of his sources are indeed religions, the advice he finds in them is as much psychological as spiritual, and as relevant today as ever, as he told us in a recent interview. Why did you write this book? Ronald Pies: I have been coming to terms with a lot of changes in my life as I reach late middle age, including many good things, but some losses, friends who have died, the kinds of things we all encounter later in life. I was trying to synthesize some s cattered ideas that I had accumulated over the years from several differ- ent spiritual traditions. I had written on Sto icism and a couple of books on Judaism, and more recently had been do ing readings in Buddhist literature. At some point it occurred to me that there were many common strands that linked these three traditions. I felt focusing on these common strands would address some of the needs that I w as feeling at the time and maybe help other people address them as well. Is there a link between these spiritual traditions and psychotherapy? There is a v ery specific link between Stoicism and rational emotive behavioral therapy, which was devised by Albert Ellis. It emphasizes the idea that our thoughts determine our feel- ings, that the way we think is the way we feel. That's essen- tially what Stoicism says. Ellis traced his views to the Stoic philosopher Epictetus. How does that work? The idea is that people develop emotional problems, to put it bluntly, because they tell themselves a l ot of nonsense, things like \"I must have everybody's love and app roval, or I'm Psychiatrist Ronald Pies culls the wisdom of Judaism, Buddhism and Stoicism for advice in coping with life's vicissitudes by taylor mcneil illustration by alex 29nothing,\" or \"I've got to succeed in everything I do , or else I'm a terrible person.\" The Sto ics would say, and Ellis would agree, that when you stop telling yourself all this nonsense, you'll find that you're much happier. Buddhism is really a k indred spirit to Stoicism in many ways, and I t hink that the Judaic tradition is as well. In your book, you demonstrate the response of each tradition to particular emoti onal problems. What would each say about anger, for example? In all three traditions, anger is regarded for the mo st part as a pretty bad thing. That may not sound very controversial, but those of us who came of age in the 1960s were told that if you're angry, you should let it rip, let it out. But what mo st psychologists have found is that when people do t hat, they just end up getting angrier. In Judaism, anger is compared to idola- try, which is very interesting. What idol are you worshipping when you get angry? The answer is yourself. If somebody insults me, or looks at me t he wrong way, that's an awful thing, because I de serve everybody's respect. In the Jewish tradition, when you find yourself really angry, what you're doing is bowing down to t he idol of your own ego. That's what most psychiatrists would say is a form of narcissism. Similarly, Buddhists would say there is nothing righteous about anger; it's always a b ad thing. There is a g reat exercise that one of the Tibetan Buddhist masters recommends when you're very angry. (It's in the book.) First of all, he says, don't tell yourself \"I am angry,\" because you are identifying your- self with the anger. Instead, say \"There is anger; I own it.\" Then imagine your anger is an infant, and now you want to hold that infant, that anger, in your arms, and sort of cradle it, nurture it. When yo u do t hat, you've owned your anger, and yo u will find yo ur anger diminishes. It's an interesting, counterintuitive way to de al with anger. The Stoics feel much the same way. They are very big on cognitive skills and logic. They would say, sit down and think logically about this. What is it that you are angry about? Well, I'm angry because I w as invited to a d inner party, and I g ot seated at the end of the table instead of near the host. The Stoics would say: Are you out of your mind? What difference does it make what part of the table you are seated at? You are making yourself angry by having this preposterous idea. The three traditions are very different in fundamental ways. What are some common approaches they offer about everyday living? One is moderation, the middle path, avoiding extremes. Another would be self-restraint. It's a critical part of Judaism, and it's a critical part of Buddhism and Stoicism. Self-restraint has all kinds of subcategories, including things like controlling anger, but also controlling gluttony or excessive sexual activity or anything for that matter. And then, m aybe surprisingly, I think all three traditions stress kindness. When the Dalai Lama, the spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism, was asked to s ummarize his religion, he said, \"Be kind to people.\" And that's it. For him, all of the trappings of religion and ceremony and complicated theology and all of this stuff come do wn to o ne idea. And the view in Judaism is very similar. Hillel, a rabbi of the Talmudic era, said, \"Don't do to o ther people what you would not have done to yo u. All the rest is commentary.\" He's basically saying in a s lightly different way w hat the Dalai Lama says. Hillel's is worded in the negative, which I think is actually a mo re psychologically astute way of saying the same thing. And the surprising thing is that in the Stoic tradition, a v ery similar thought is expressed. We are all human beings, we all breathe the same air, they say; we all have a responsibility to be kind and decent to e ach other. Stoics are often thought of as stiff- upper-lip logicians, and the assumption is that there is no spiri- tual quality to them, but in fact there really is. They see the same kind of need for kindness to o ur fellow human beings. How can people integrate the knowledge that you offer in the book into their lives? People interested in these three traditions will find the common strands that unite them and find ways of working them into their own lives. But each person, I t hink, needs to find a p ath that is comfortable: Zen meditation, reading Marcus Aurelius\u2014there is a very good new translation of his Meditations by the Hicks brothers\u2014or becoming involved in the Jewish faith. For some people, and I think this is true for me, it will be finding bits and pieces of all three traditions and somehow just melding them into their lives. My own way of making these things real and part of my life is to practice the thinking that great sages advocate. And I mean really practice, like practicing an instrument. I have 20 sayings taped on my computer monitor; they are literally in front of my eyes every day. I often begin the day by reading two or three of those, sayings such as this one by Rabbi Rami Shapiro: \"Don't take life so seriously; it's only temporary.\" I read these sayings and try to commit them to me mory, and I call them up when I fi nd myself becoming upset or angry, sad or depressed. tm Taylor McNeil, the senior news editor in Tufts' Office of Publications, can be reached at fall 2013university news the wider world of tufts educing waste by 3 p ercent a y ear, curbing energy c on- sumption by 5 to 7 p ercent over the next three years and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 85 percent over the next three de cades are among the ambitious goals that the Tufts Campus Sustainability Council has set to support President Anthony P. Monaco's initiative to m aintain the university's longtime leadership position on environmental issues. \"Our topic areas are limited to campus waste, water, energy and emis- sions, but the university activities around sustainability span academics and research, student engagement and operations,\" says Linda Snyder, vice presi- dent of operations, who serves on the council and whose division will spear- head the implementation of many of the green goals. \"This really defines the future of sustainability for all colleges and universities.\" \"Universities play a c rucial role in helping the world adapt t o a c hanging planet and to challenging issues, such as climate change and resource deple- tion,\" Monaco wrote in the prelude to the Campus Sustainability Council Report, released in late May. \"Tufts faculty address these issues at the highest level of insight, both in their teaching and with our students to break new ground in research,\" he wrote. \"We want people to think of our campuses as environmental learning labs, coordinating the research of faculty and students and making everyone an important player in achieving change,\" says Executive Vice President Patricia Campbell, who cochaired the 21-member Sustainability Council with M onaco. \"It really is an overall change in culture focused on environmental sustainability.\" Those changes will be green in more than one way\u2014they will help Tufts' bottom line, too. \"It's one of those win-wins,\" says Campbell. \"You do t he right thing for the environment, and through cost savings, it increases the resources available to support what comes out of President Monaco's stra- tegic-planning initiative that will position the university for the future.\" In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2012, Tufts spent $81 million on facility operations\u2014about 11 percent of the univer- sity's total $743 million annual budget, says Snyder. \"If we could reduce facility opera- tions costs, it could potentially free up mil- lions of dollars to s upport teaching, research and other university priorities,\" she says. Tufts' first LEED-certified green build- ing, the Sophia Gordon residence hall, was constructed on the Medford/Somerville campus in 2006, and the dental school's five- story addition was compl eted on the Boston campus in 2009, earning LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. In August, the biology laborato- ries at 200 Boston Ave. on the Medford/ Somerville campus received LEED gold certification. Sixty students, faculty and staff members from all three campuses worked for more than a y ear to de velop the environmental recommendations. The report calls for the university to develop new ways to reduce water and energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and the production of waste. For example, water consumption is curbed with additional water-efficient toilets, showerheads and lab equipment, and with the use of well water for irrigation. On the Medford/Somerville campus, efforts continue to d irect runoff away from storm drains with the new gar- dens at the Tisch Sports and Fitness Center and the garden near Hodgdon Hall. To cut energy consumption by 5 to 7 p er- cent each year for the next three years, the report recommends installing networked mechanical systems to c entrally control and monitor heating, cooling and electricity use. Presidential council sets ambitious sustainability goals that will also help the bottom line by Gail BambrickGetting Greener illustration : federico jordan 33638p30-31.indd 30 10/18/13 3:33 PMSnyder notes that there is currently no way to me asure energy use in 60 to 7 0 percent of buildings on the Medford/Somerville cam- pus that are fed by its central power plant. Other recommendations include audit- ing the electrical, heating and cooling sys- tems on all three campuses and establishing sustainability protocols for new building projects and equipment upgrades. Lower energy consumption will sup- port the report's goals of reducing green- house gas emissions to 10 to 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, and 75 to 85 percent below 2001 levels by 2050. More and More recycling Changing the community's behavior is just as important as the installation of green mechanical systems, Campbell says, not- ing that the Tufts Office of Sustainability will develop a s ocial marketing campaign to further that goal. There are already some good examples of savings that can come f rom n ot just reducing waste, but managing it properly. Tufts' overall recycling rate has steadily increased since 2005, primarily the result of aggressive recycling on the Medford/ Somerville campus, where 53 percent of waste is recycled, says Snyder. While rates are lower on the Boston and Grafton campuses, 27 and 13 percent respec- tively, recycling on these campuses largely occurs in clinics and laboratories, which presents unique challenges, according to the report. Starting later this year, Tufts Recycles! will begin to create waste profiles of each school that will help each campus meet the ambitious waste-reduction goals outlined in the Sustainability Council report. Tufts' waste-management contracts com- pensate the vendor for increases in recycling and composting, and require data-driven waste management, meaning that trash is sorted and weighed so Tufts knows exactly what it's throwing away, says Snyder. The new university contract for waste management, with Boston-based Save That Stuff Inc., will result in $100,000 in savings over last year's $500,000 contract. \"This is a really fortunate area where our financial goals align with our values,\" says Snyder. \"This is why I think the waste-management goals are doable, because we already have a company poised to h elp us with that.\" Save That Stuff helped Boston University grow its recycling rate from 3 t o 34 per- cent over three years and assisted Boston College in reducing its solid waste output by 50 percent over eight years. To achieve further waste reductions, the report recommends adopting a \" cra- dle-to-cradle\" app roach to purchasing decisions, taking into account the life- cycle of products and their components, with the goal of buying products and materials that have a small environmental footprint and a h igh reuse value. The university will consider renewable energy when it makes sense from a u sage and payback perspective, Campbell says. A good example is the Grafton Solar Project, in which Sun Edison will install two solar collection systems on the Cummings School campus once the proper permits have been obtained. Tufts will purchase the power gen- erated by Sun Edison, w hich will provide about half the veterinary school's energy needs, saving mo re than $200,000 annually.

Solomont, A70, A08P, the former U.S. ambassador to Spain and Andorra and a lifelong social and political activist, will become the Pierre and Pamela omidyar Dean of the Jonathan m. tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at tufts on January 2. In announcing the appointment, Provost and Senior Vice President David harris noted that Solomont 's \"commitment to active enga gement in the world around him, his belief in the power of higher education and his strengths as a diplomat, entrepreneur and social activist will enable him ... t o advance tisch College from its highly successful formative years to a future as the unquestioned international academic leader in promoting active citizenship and civic enga gement.\" tisch College embraces public service and active citizenship as university- wide values. It works directly with students and faculty across all of tufts' undergraduate, graduate and professional schools. like President obama, who nominated him for the ambassadorship in the summer of 2009, Solomont as a young man worked as a community organizer, in the city of lowell, mass. throughout his career, much of it spent in the health- and elder-care arenas, Solomont has embraced the ability of political activism and public service to benefit society. from 2000 to 2010, he served on the bipartisan board of directors of the Corporation for national and Community Service, the federal agency that oversees such domestic service programs as AmeriCorps, learn and Serve America, VIStA and Senior Corps. \"for me, returning to tufts as the dean of tisch College is coming home to an institution I love and that has meant so much to me and my family,\" said Solomont, a trustee emeritus of tufts and founding chair of the tisch College board of advisors. \"I am excited to lead one of tufts' signature initiatives and to apply my passion for active citizenship and civic engagement to build on tisch's solid foundation and to propel it to new heights.\" fall 2013 tuft s me dicine 31 Photo: james rajotteFormer U.S. ambaSSador named dean oF dicine fall 2013and discovering how important it was to connect with everyone else again.\" Fariba Houman, Ph.D.90, explains the pull based on her time a s a student in the department. \"It was fantastic to b e there,\" she says of her seven years in residence. \"All the alumni will tell you this. I remem- ber that it felt like one big family where the professors really took an interest in you and made sure you succeeded. In other graduate schools, your bosses might not even know who you are,\" she adds, \"but when I h ad my first baby, Andrew W right [professor emeritus, her faculty advisor] was there.\" Houman is now director of the Human Re search Protections Program at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Moselio Schaechter, distinguished pro- fessor emeritus, was there at the start\u2014as a cofounder of the de partment in 1962 with James T. \"Ted\" Park, and chair from 1970 to 1993\u2014and helped create that special atmosphere. \"Starting out from scratch, you could de fine the department the way you wanted,\" he points out. \"Early on, P ark [the chair from 1962 to 1970] said every faculty member would have an equal say. Every decision was to be made by consensus, and that become t he way f you had been standing outside a c ertain bo wling alley in davis Square, Somerville, on the last day of June, you might have heard the muffled sounds of conversation and laughter coming from inside the place. Was this a w ild family reunion of some kind? In a s ense it was, as the Department of Molecular Biology and M icrobiology, known around campus for its warm, convivial atmosphere, celebrated the 50th anni- versary of its founding. The department was actually launched in 1962, but as Professor Abraham L. \"Linc\" Sonenshein says with a l augh, the reunion \"took a w hile to organize.\" Nearly a h undred graduates of the department and its affiliated graduate program showed up from around the world, and together with current staff and faculty, accounted for between 150 and 170 people in attendance at the various gatherings over the two-day commemoration. Sunday was the fun, informal first day. Visitors had a b arbecue lunch, w atched some old videos documenting departmental life and toured the new labs in the Jaharis Center and Arnold before heading off to Davis Square that evening for rounds of pizza and bowling. \"People had a g reat time talking, moving from table to table and recon- necting with people they may not have seen in 50 years,\" says Sonenshein. \"This was special.

Ana Soto\u2014who, together with Carlos Sonnenschein, was the first to sound the alarm about the presence of estrogen-mimicking compounds in household plastic\u2014was awarded a $ 450,000 grant from the Avon Foundation for Women on May 19. The funding will support the work of the two longtime collaborators investigating the role of natural hormones and environmental chemicals in the development of breast cancer. Soto and Sonnenschein, both professors in the Department of Integrative Physiology and Pathobiology, have been studying how sex hormones regulate cell proliferation and how environmental contaminants may interfere with those processes. Prominent leukemia researcher Naomi Rosenberg, dean of the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, and breast cancer specialist John Erban, '81, professor of medicine, were the recipients of a grant from the Aid for Cancer Research on May 23 that will fund the purchase of a state-of- the-art inverted microscope sure to prove valuable in the work of a number of scientists within the Tufts community. The new microscope\u2014capab le of displaying fluorescence resonance energy transfer in live cells\u2014will let researchers directly observe the interaction of molecules with each other, says Rosenberg, who notes the device will benefit eight scientist s around Tufts. Erban is an internationally recognized expert in breast cancer diagnosis and treatme nt. He is the clinical director and associate director for clinical research at the Tufts Cancer Center.lens on cancer research fall 2013 tuft s me dicine 33 Photo: alonso nicholswe did business.\" Faculty me mbers would routinely circulate their grant proposals to each other, soliciting colleagues' com- ments and suggestions for improvement. Students could de tect the difference in tone as soon as they arrived, Schaechter remarks, adding, \"They knew this was not a set of silos. Everybody cared about everybody else.\" Now 85 years old, retired and living in California, Schaechter has a l onger perspective than anyone else concerning the emergence and growth of the depart- ment. \"We have graduated more than 180 Ph.D.s, and m ost have do ne very well, wherever they are,\" he says. \"We seeded the country\u2014we have do ne our job .\" When pressed, Schaechter attributes the department's half-century of scholarly achievement carried forward within an atmosphere of kindred spirits to \"person- alities and good luck.\" Part of the luck came from the fact that hardly anyone ever left the place, sav- ing the department the cost of recruiting new faculty members\u2014and also from the boom times in research funding that marked the early days. \"In the 1960s, money was there for the asking,\" says Schaechter. \"That removed a h uge bur- den. The NIH funding grew and grew and grew, at something like 15 percent a year, so you didn't have that 700-pound gorilla on yo ur back.\" Catherine Squires, professor emeritus and Schaechter's successor de partment chair, attended the reunion and found special delight in the brief presentations by former students and postdoctoral fellows at the symposium that filled the schedule on Monday. \"It was such a p leasure to hear the people who were in the de partment give talks and tell what they are do ing now. It's just hard not to be really proud,\" she says. Then she adds, in a w istful comment that seems to have permeated the whole event, going back to t he me rriment in Davis Square, \"I miss the people of Tufts.\" The new microscope that Tufts will purchase with a grant from Aid for Cancer Research will allow sciences to \"look at molecules thought to play key roles in cancer development and progression,\" says Naomi Rosenberg. 33638p32-41.indd 33 10/18/13 4:14 2013on camp us Barbarajean Magnani has been named the first chair of the newly formed department of anatomic and clinical Pathology. integral to the medical school reorganization of the basic science departments (see \"growing new synapses,\" page 16), the trustees of tufts university approved the creation of this, the medical school's 20th clinical department, which will provide an academic home for pathologists throughout the medical school's entire system of affiliated hospitals for purposes of appointments, promotions and scholarly and teaching activities. Magnani, or \"Bj\" as she is more popularly known, first came to the medical school from Boston university in 2008 as a professor of pathology. she had served as chief of the department of laboratory Medicine and associate professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Boston university school of Medicine. in 2009 she assumed the role of chief of clinical operations and vice chair of the department of Pathology and laboratory Medicine at tufts, and in 2011 became chair and pathologist-in-chief at tufts Medical center. Magnani, who earned both the M.d. and Ph.d., is internationally recognized for her expertise in the field of laboratory medicine, specifically in clinical chemistry, clinical and forensic toxicology and natural toxins. she has presented numerous workshops and seminars in the field and has received two outstanding speaker awards from the association for clinical chemistry. in addition to having written several textbooks in toxicology, she is author of the lily robinson mysteries, presenting episodes involving toxicology, which originally appeared in the Journal of Clinical Chemistry. she holds several leadership positions in the college of american Pathologists, which presented her its outstanding communicator award in 2012. new chair his year's White Coat ceremony, a symbolic rite demonstrating medi cine's warm welcome of its newest memb ers-in-training, was held on September 7 at the Cutler Majestic Theatre in Boston.

And you need to understand your patients as not just a collection of organs, but as a whole person.\" Wanting to help mo re me dical students learn this app roach, Blackman and his wife, Joan, a p hysical therapist, have endowed the new Robert A., M69, and Joan S. Blackman Foundation Scholarship at Tufts University School of Medicine. They made their gift as part of the ongoing Financial Aid Initiative, which matches any newly established schol- arship or an additional contribution to an existing scholarship of $100,000 or mo re. \"I hope [the scholarship] will pre- serve an old-school app roach to me dicine that is patient-centered and humanistic,\" Blackman says. \"You want to be a servant- healer. Tufts is carrying that me ssage.\" While modern technolo gies are mar- velous tools for diagnosis and treatment, Blackman says, doctors should never use them in lieu of a traditional thorough his- tory and physical exam. Listening closely to the patient is the key to reaching an accurate diagnosis more quickly, avoiding unneces- sary tests and consultations and decreasing costs, he has learned. \"Even more impor- tantly, you bond with the patients and gain their trust,\" he says. Blackman speaks from his experience as an internist and longtime r egional medical director of HealthCare Partners Medical Group, which serves more than 1 m illion patients in six states and is poised to grow even mo re, he says. \"We just practice the way Tufts taught us,\" he adds. \"I've been very blessed and very fortunate to b e in the position to p ay it forward.\" As of midsummer, the following donors had joined Blackman in either creating new endowed scholarships or adding to e xisting scholarships through the Financial Aid Initiative: THoMAS RoCKEL, '61 Fifty-six years ago w hen R ockel first stepped through the doors of Tufts Medical School, \"my tuition was about the cost of what you'd pay for a c heap car today,\" he says. \"Things have changed.\" In m any ways, they've changed for the better, thanks to generous alumni. Three years ago, Rockel and his wife, Norma, established the Jaharis Challenge Rockel Scholarship Fund, responding to a matching challenge that named a S ackler Center classroom after them and created a $ 100,000 scholar- ship. When they learned that the university would once again match gifts dollar for dol- lar, they gave another $100,000, which will be do ubled. \"Tufts provided me with the credentials and training to do w ell,\" he says. \"I wanted to pass on that opportunity.\" Rockel's app reciation of Tufts School of Medicine not only comes from his time as a student; he had a fellowship at Tufts and was an assistant clinical professor of pediatric Robert, '69, and Joan Blackman at home in Mailbu, Calif. 36 tuft s me dicine fall 2013 Photo: genaro MolinoA Double Helpingadvancement giving. growth. gra titude.

Dr. Mike moved to the United States from Russia with his family as a c hild. He was the youngest of six and the first in his family to graduate from college and then medical school. He made house calls until illness prevented that, close to the end of his 52-year practice as an allergy and pul- monary specialist in Elizabeth, N.J. Says his son, \"My father gave me and my siblings a c lear sense of right and wrong, of fairness, honesty and respect for others, regardless of skin color, religious background or place of origin. Through his work ethic, he set an example and made it possible for us to enjoy educational opportunities at far less personal sacrifice than he experienced.\" Dr. Mike's family is assisting aspiring physicians through the Meyer T.

Born into an O rthodox Jewish family in 1912 in Bangor, Maine, Shapero served as a m ajor in the U.S. Air Force during World W ar II. After the war, he returned to Bangor, where he practiced pediatrics for 56 years before retiring with his wife to West Palm Beach, Fla. The family's devotion to Tufts Medical School runs three generations deep: their son, Paul Shapero, '73, '17P, followed in his footsteps in her white coat in Boston this fall.

At 16, she came to the United States from G reece, married shortly after and settled in Lowell, M ass., where she raised her 13 children. After retiring from medicine, Eliopoulos wanted to h onor his devoted mother and make a m edical edu- cation possible for others. His son, St even Eliopoulos, A89, had an idea: Make a g ift to Tufts University School of Medicine in her name. Steven and his brother Michael, A91, earned their undergraduate de grees from Tufts, but no one in the family, in- cluding their brother Peter, had attended Tufts Medical School. But, notes Steven Eliopoulos, \"some of my father's memora- ble and formative years as a p hysician were spent during his training at New England Medical Center,\" now Tufts Medical Center. Together with their sons, John and Betty Eliopoulos have endowed the Adiamandia L. Eliopoulos Scholarship Fund to help fourth-year medical students defray costs as they prepare for residency. It will be a fitting tribute to a m atriarch whose name came from the Greek word for \"diamond.\" Says John Eliopoulos, \"She was a true gem.\" edWard, a49, '53, and marcia naleBuFF Though the couple established the Edward A. Nalebuff Scholarship Fund 30 years ago, Edward Nalebuff says he still feels \"I owe so much to Tufts.\" That's why he didn't hesitate to increase his scholarship to have his gift matched by the school when the Financial Aid Initiative launched. He wanted to help even more deserving stu- dents than he'd already done for decades. Nalebuff retired as chief of hand surgery at New England Baptist Hospital in 2003. He remains a clinical professor of orthope- dics at Tufts. An active alumnus, Nalebuff founded the Tufts orthopedic alumni club known as the Arthur A. Thibodeau Gr oup, in honor of his former professor. Nalebuff always tells his me dical students: \"I've never worked a d ay in my life,\" because, he says, \"Even though I've been seeing patients for 60 years, I would have done it all for free. That's how much I love my work. And none of this would have been possible without Tufts.\" kenneTh, '53, a88P, and PaTricia nanian It was a l etter from a n old classmate and a m atching gift challenge that made Kenneth Nanian realize that now was the perfect time to do w hat he'd always want- ed: give back to t he school that had ful- filled his childhood dream of becoming a do ctor\u2014and with do uble the impact. When Nanian received a l etter from h is friend Edward Nalebuff, A49, '53, asking him to think about a c ontribution to the Financial Aid Initiative, Nanian imme- diately wanted to aid the cause, but how? Fortunately, Nalebuff's letter offered an answer: A l aw had been passed allowing tax-free transfers of IRA funds to philan- thropic causes for those of a c ertain age. \"It was perfect,\" Nanian says. Medical school tuition was $400 a y ear when he and Nalebuff were first-year students, and had risen to $800 by the time they gradu- ated. \"It was expensive, but something you could pay off with a g ood summer in- ternship,\" Nanian points out. \"But that's nothing compared to the sums today.\" With the Patricia and Kenneth Nanian, M53, A88P, Scholarship Fu nd, \"we're help- ing future do ctors fulfill their missions to go to medical school,\" he says.
