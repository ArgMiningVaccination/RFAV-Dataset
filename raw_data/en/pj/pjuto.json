There are stages and phases of our lives when we simply need a little more support. Whether emotional, physical, or mental, long-term build up of stress slowly chips away at our energy, resiliency, and overall vitality. Loading up on caffeine to get through the day, and then countering with sedative supplements or medications to wind down and combat insomnia in the evening wreaks havoc on our nervous systems. And this simply isn't a sustainable way to take care of ourselves. That's where adaptogenic herbs come in to save the day, and frankly, our overall health. What are adaptogens?

Herbal medicine has been used for centuries for a variety of reasons, including the need to [adapt and counteract the negative effects of stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4790408/). What Are Adaptogens? Herbs with adaptogenic properties [modulate our stress response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991026/). What that means is adaptogens support the body in buffering the effects of mental, physical, and emotional stress. Adaptogens work on the endocrine system, which keeps our hormones balanced, decreases the cumulative effects of stress on our minds and bodies, and - as a result - allows us to better cope within our daily lives. Although adaptogens work primarily on the endocrine system, they also have additional properties that further support the body in different ways. For example, some herbs also have [immune boosting properties](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ptr.1938), such as Astragalus. Others are more nootropic (AKA help you focus), such as ginseng.

And What Are Adaptogens Benefits? One of the biggest benefits of using adaptogens as support is that they are modulators. This means they upregulate or downregulate our systems, depending on what we need to move toward balance. Our bodies strive to be in a place of homeostasis, of balance, of that sweet midline. Adaptogens help [stabilize our physiological processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/adaptogen) and encourage the shift toward homeostasis. For example, some will increase blood pressure, and others will lower it. Some will be more stimulating and help you perform mentally and physically. Others have more sedative properties that will help you relax and unwind. Some [common uses and additional benefits](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/adaptogen) include: - Supporting and increasing thyroid function - Dealing with acute and chronic stress - Countering fatigue and burnout - Stimulating (without the jitters and crash that we get from caffeine) - Assisting in liver function and hormone balancing - Boosting immune function and increasing bounce back time when we do get sick In short, adaptogens will help our bodies compensate less, and harmonize more.
