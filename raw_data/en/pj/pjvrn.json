The context? The president had contracted COVID-19, and his physician at the time was a doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO). That got many in the public and media wondering: what is a DO, anyway? In this article, I'll tell you what it takes to become a DO, why osteopathic training is especially relevant in value-based care settings like ChenMed's, and how DOs are playing an important role in addressing the massive challenges American healthcare faces in a post-COVID-19 world. What's the difference between a DO and an MD? As an aspiring DO, you prepare the same way as you would to become an MD: you take the same science and anatomy prerequisites, sit for the MCAT, and send out a lot of applications to schools. When I was in college, I pursued my EMT certification and worked in EMS for a few years before pursuing my medical career. I interviewed with both MD and DO schools, and I ultimately decided to attend Oregon's Western University of Health Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific-Northwest because I was drawn to the whole-patient approach inherent in osteopathic medicine. Training to become a DO is, in many ways, the same as training to become an MD. You complete four years of medical school, pass national licensing exams, and train alongside one another in residency programs relevant to the specialty you want to practice. DOs, however, receive additional training in a variety of manual techniques which are collectively referred to as osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT). These manual techniques work in concert with the body's natural tendency toward health and self-healing, a foundational principle of the whole-patient treatment approach. OMT is a tool DOs may use in addition to the traditional medications and surgery available to all medical providers. Once you're out in practice, there isn't much difference between a DO and an MD. And unless a patient looks at your credentials on paper, they probably couldn't tell whether you're a DO or an MD. DOs are natural primary care physicians DO training emphasizes preventing disease and minimizing surgical or pharmaceutical interventions - a philosophy that leads many of us into primary care settings. In 2019, about 57 percent of DOs specialized in primary care compared with less than 30 percent of MDs, according to statistics from the American Osteopathic Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges. Our goal, as DOs, is to improve quality of life and prevent problems from growing worse down the road, which is exactly what we are accomplishing at ChenMed! For example, in a physical exam, I noticed a patient had a symmetry problem that correlated with short-leg syndrome. That's a pretty common issue that can lead to a strain pattern in the body resulting in chronic back pain. And back pain is one of the leading causes for Americans to be out of work. Many providers would recommend that the patient consult with an orthopedic doctor, take medication, or consider surgery. But as a DO, I prescribed something simpler: putting a shim in the patient's shoe to help make their height more even. In the near term, the intervention reduced the patient's pain. In the long term, it likely reduced their risk of complications and expensive interventions. My diagnosis and treatment plan for the short-leg syndrome patient required a detailed physical exam - a cornerstone of the ChenMed approach to patient care. It's all about the doctor-patient relationship: placing the highest value on accountability, accessibility, and early disease detection and management. If we accomplish this, we will maintain our patients' quality of life while reducing expensive hospital admissions, consultations, and procedures. That's a philosophy that's attractive to many medical professionals, but especially DOs like me. How DOs can help solve America's health care crisis Even before COVID-19 reached our shores early last year, the United States faced a looming shortage of health care professionals over the next decade. With our medical system strained beyond anything we could have imagined pre-pandemic, doctors in all specialties are leaving the profession due to burnout. The osteopathic profession is working to reduce America's physician shortage, providing additional training opportunities for individuals who want to pursue medical careers. The number of practicing DOs has grown more than 63 percent in the past decade, and colleges of osteopathic medicine now train a quarter of all U.S. medical students. The medical profession as a whole is still growing to understand DOs, while DO and MD practices are starting to assimilate at the highest levels. In addition to the AMA's statement last fall, the AOA, American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education have united to provide a single accreditation system for all U.S. medical schools. At the end of the day, both MDs and DOs have the skills and training to successfully support their patients - the difference is merely what tools the doctor may choose to use to achieve that goal. The most important thing for any patient is to find a physician (DO or MD) who fills one's needs - mind, body, and soul. I continue to find myself drawn to the healthy mind, healthy body, whole-patient approach inherent in osteopathic medicine. I'm glad I've found in ChenMed a practice that elevates those ideals, and I'd encourage other providers (especially DOs) to consider doing the same. Interested in Life at ChenMed?
