Today, as more people seek to achieve a healthy mind and body through holistic methods, the 'alternative' concept is increasingly in demand. This desire for new approaches to good health has been aided by the explosive growth of the spa industry. People are spending more money than before on complementary medicine, including aromatherapy oils, professionally and at home. According to the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy in America, aromatherapy is 'an art and science which seeks to explore the physiological, psychological and spiritual realm of the individual's response to aromatic extracts as well as to observe and enhance the individual's innate healing process'. But if you do not know how to use the oils, chances are you will not reap the full benefits, and you could even be doing yourself harm. There is scientific evidence to support the benefits of some alternative therapies for chronic or mild conditions, but the industry is largely unregulated. And as usage increases, so do the number of adverse reactions. According to a recent press release issued by the World Health Organisation, there were 9,854 known reported cases of adverse reactions on the mainland in 2002.

Silky soothers Emotional Anxiety and stress: use oils that lift spirits, calm or relax. Spicy-scented frankincense is used less commonly than many oils but has a rejuvenating effect. Bergamot, taken from the rind of a variety of Seville orange, is an uplifting oil, and one of the many psychological uses of lavender is to reduce anxiety or stress. Petitgrain can also be used. Insomnia: use oils that soothe or relax. Chamomile aids relaxation and helps induce sleepiness. Lavender also helps with sleep problems. Vetiver, which has a woody, earthy scent, can also be used. To lift mood: Citrus oils such as citrus lemon are uplifting and relaxing. Rosewood is a refreshing oil that can help rid the mind of grumpiness and promote stability. Rose and frankincense are also recommended. Medicinal Cold/flu: Eucalyptus is good for respiratory problems and can be used as an inhalant to treat coughs, colds, catarrh and congestion. It also helps boost the immune system. Niaouli can also be effective. Muscle aches: Black pepper has a hot stimulating effect and is therefore good for muscular aches. Rosemary, ginger and lavender are also recommended. Stretch marks: Wheatgerm oil and evening primrose mixed with rose and lavender are recommended. (Strict guidelines should be followed when using essential oils during pregnancy. Contact a qualified aromatherapist for advice). Versatile oils: No oil is more versatile than lavender. If you have only one essential oil in a first aid kit, this should be it. As well as for the conditions mentioned above, lavender can help physical conditions such as headache tension, insect bites, nausea, PMT, stings and sunburn. It can also help ease emotional conditions such as hysteria, insecurity, mood swings, panic attacks and worry. Geranium also has a number of uses, including balancing emotional conditions, aiding skin conditions such as dermatitis, eczema and hormonal problems including PMT. Essential facts Separating the good from the average: When buying an essential oil, look for a high-grade oil that is exactly what it says it is and is therefore effective, says Liz Sheenan of British-based Aromatherapy Associates. 'Customers need to know they are buying from a trusted supplier. Rosemary should be pure rosemary and not adulterated with other oil such as eucalyptus, which is cheaper.' High-quality oils are carefully distilled using correct temperatures and good quality, single species plants - which is why they are expensive. Ms Sheenan says oils should be judged much the way a sommelier might judge wine. 'It is very similar to wine. They may come from the same type of grape but the end products are very different due to the growing conditions and also the production process.' Also, ask the sales staff where the oils are from - they should be able to give background information. The sniff test: The best way to learn the difference between an excellent oil and a lower grade one is to start sniffing. Our noses get used to good and bad smells, so trust your judgment. Ms Sheenan says: 'Once you smell a good oil you will always know one. It is like eating a delicious vine of ripened tomatoes.' First impressions count. Bottles should be dark, otherwise oils will oxidise. They should also be fitted with a dropper so the quantity of oil used can be measured. A good brand will put the botanical name of the plant on the bottle (an oil should come from one type of plant, not a mix). Rules for successful aromatherapy at home: If you are blending your own oils, Ms Sheenan's advice is to be sure you know exactly what you are doing. STYLING: Jowie Chan "}
