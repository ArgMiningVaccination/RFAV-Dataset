The Master of Science in Biomedical Data Science (MSBDS) program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai integrates training and education in various aspects of biomedical sciences with machine learning, computer systems, and big data analysis, as well as access to large electronic medical record-linked biomedical repositories. Housed within the [Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences](/education/graduate), our Program offers a unique opportunity for students with a strong quantitative background to hone the skills necessary to enrich\u2014and ultimately to lead\u2014the biomedical workforce of tomorrow. For years, the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences has been nurturing an interdisciplinary culture to further advance this field. Our faculty includes numerous biomedical data scientists in the areas of computational genomics; computational biophysics; environmental medicine; public health; health systems design; and health information technology. In addition, the [Biomedical Data Science Initiative](/education/graduate/data-science) at the School organizes research and educational endeavors in biomedical data science across various departments and institutes. Mount Sinai also offers several in-house opportunities for career development in biomedical data science, including - but not limited to - [Sema4](https://sema4genomics.com/our-story/), a for-profit health information company aiming to revolutionize clinical diagnostics, and the [Institute for Next Generation Healthcare](/research/next-gen), which offers a new model of biomedical research and market delivery through the creation of a technology-enabled platform. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is committed to improving diversity among our students, trainees and faculty; Individuals from underrepresented groups in science are particularly encouraged to [apply](https://applygs.mssm.edu).
