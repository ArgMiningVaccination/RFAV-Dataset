As part of its 2022 CHNA, Children's Minnesota partnered with Wilder Research to conduct the assessment, which included both primary data collection - through a series of focus and discus sion groups and individual interviews - as well as a review of existing secondary health- related data. (All data collection methods are described below.) Throughout the CHNA process, Children's Minnesota and Wilder also met quarterly with a Community Advisory Committee (CAC) in order to get input on r esearch questions, data collection tools and findings . At the beginning of the assessment, CAC members helped form the following guiding evaluation questions : What does it look like when children and families are healthy? To what extent are children and families experiencing the 2019 priority areas differently, considering local and global events ? What health issues are newly emerging or are likely to emerge i n the next couple of years that will have a negative impact on the health of the community? What are the most important issues to address to improve the lives of children and families in the community? What resources, strengths and assets exist in the comm unity today that have a positive impact on the health of the community? What are the barriers to doing what needs to be done to improve the health of the community? What can Children's Minnesota do to advanc e the health of the community? What can be done w ithin the Children's Minnesota organization, in partnership with other community organizations, or by supporting larger (i.e., state and local) efforts?

Model.\" https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore- health- rankings/county -health- Since conducting its community health needs assessment (CHNA) in 2016, Children's Minnesota has had an expansive view of what it means to identify and address the needs of the community. Rather than only considering the traditional medical conditions their health system treats (e.g. , asthma) and patients' health behavior s, Children's Minnesota prioritizes understanding the needs of the community as they relate to social determinants of health, which shape children's and families ' experiences outside of Children's Minnesota's walls. The purpose of this work is to continually assess the health of children and famil ies who live in the areas that Children's Minnesota serves and, every three years, determine if any health priorities need to be added or revised . Children's Minnesota's work is guided by the following beliefs in order to conduct an assessment that is able to identify the most fundamental health needs of the community and that positions them to partner with the community to address those needs: Health is strongly influenced by the conditions in which people are bor n, live, learn, work, play, worship and age. These conditions, also called social determinants of health, have a greater influence on health than health care services , as indicated in the image above.1 Social determinants of health are shaped by structures, decisions and policies that influence how money, power and resources are distributed. Using a racial equity lens in the CHNA process is important, as inequities result when policies and systems that were designed to advantage affluent and often white, residents negatively impact groups of people, often people of color and lower -income residents. Policies that disproportionately impact people of color may not mention race explicitly. Inequities can also result when the full impacts of policies are not considered and if people most 1 Schroeder, S. (2007). We can do better - Improving the health of the American People.

Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 5 likely to be impacted by a proposed policy have limited influence or are excluded from decisions that impact health and well -being. Recent context It is crucial to note that between the 2019 and 2022 CHNA there were several significant events that impacted the way people viewed and engaged with the world around them, both in Minnesota and globally. In early 2020, Minnesota (along with the rest of the world) was impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic, which included mandatory shut -downs of businesses and schools, as well as social distancing. Schools were forced to move in- class learning to virtual \"distance learning.\" In addition, unemployment skyrocketed to historically high levels, surpassing the Great Recession. While the rate of COVID -19 infections among children has been lower compared to other age groups, the ways in which COVID disproportionally impacted certain adult populations created community instability that impacted families. 2 In May 2020, George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer in South Minneapolis. This tragi c event had a profound impact on the local community, exacerbating grief, trauma and anxiety resulting from generations of racial injustice. The community -led uprising in response to this tragedy called for an end to systemic racism in policing and other s ystems, garnering support for important anti -racist work across the country and globally. In discussions with CHNA contributors focused on the health issues prioritized in this assessment, it is clear that these and other events in many ways exacerbated t he challenges facing children and families in the community, underscoring the critical need to pursue systemic change. About this report This report describes pertinent demographic and health indicator data from secondary data sources (first half of the report) and summarizes findings from primary data collection activities, both of which were used to identify and prioritize the health topics that community members believe are most critical for Children's Min nesota to address . Subsequent reports will more succinctly describe the 2022 CHNA process and findings (i.e. , the official 2022 Children's Minnesota CHNA report), as well as the specific actions Children's Minnesota will take during the next three years to address these priority topics. The data in this document are intended to provide a point -in-time picture of select metrics related to the demographics and health indicators of the Children's Minnesota community. The data in this summary are not intended to be used in comparison with earlier Children's Minnesota CHNA data summaries, in particular due to the overlapping nature of the American Community Survey estimates used across versions . Additionally, while the data included in this report cover a wide r ange of topics, they do not provide a comprehensive summary of all demographic information related to the Children's Minnesota community or all factors that could influence the health of community members. Summary of methods and limitations Secondary data collection Wilder Research reviewed and analyzed data from multiple secondary data sources for this report ; the most commonly used sources include the American Community Survey , Minnesota Department of Health Public Health Data Access 2 Minnesota Department of Health . (2022). Health equity and COVID -19. https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/equity/about/covid19.html Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 6 Portal and the U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census . (A full list of data sources, as well as methods and limitations , can be found in the \"Considerations for interpreting secondary data\" section .) It is important to not e several limitations up front to inform the readers ' understanding of the data: The majority of data in this report reflect pre -pandemic outcomes and trends . Some data represent broader populations than those that are the focus of the CHNA . Demographic data, particularly race and ethnicity, are aggregated into groups that do not fully represent the unique identities of Twin Cities' communities. Primary data collection Multiple stakeholder groups were asked to consider whether the health topic areas prioritized through the 2019 CHNA process continue to be community needs that should be addressed by Children's Minnesota. All groups, listed below, were also invited to identify additional emerging or unmet health needs within the community. Parent and caregiver focus groups (August -September 2022). Wilder Research c onducted two parent/caregiver virtual focus groups with a total of 15 participants . Youth focus groups (August 2022). Youthprise, a Minneapolis -based nonprofit youth development organization, conducted two virtual focus groups with a total of 15 participants . Community -based organization interviews (June -August 2022). Wilder Research conducted 30 semi - structured interviews with representatives of community -based organizations who work closely with children and families . Children's Minnesota staff discussion groups (May 2022). Twenty -nine (29) staff in roles including social workers, interpreters, service coordinators, family resource managers and family liaisons attended one of two virtual discussion groups (one focused on staff located in St. Paul and one f ocused on staff located in Minneapolis). Children's Minnesota provider interviews (May -June 2022). Wilder Research conducted semi -structured interviews with 12 Children's Minnesota health care providers. Participants included physicians, social workers , psychologists and nurse practitioners who worked in multiple Children's Minnesota locations and settings. It is important to note that without doing exhaustive qualitative data collection across a larger number of respondents , we cannot definitively say the experiences of those participating in data collection activities are representative of their particular community, whether it be a parent, youth, staff, provider, or community organization. Secondary data review A review of secondary data sources was used to describe demographic trends and to identify potential changes in health outcomes or emerging health concerns among youth who live in the seven -county Twin Cities metro area. The demographic data used for that purpose were largely from the American Community Survey (ACS), the U.S. Census Bureau, Minnesota Student Survey, Minnesota Department of Health Public Health Data Access Portal and other state and federal sources. Patient data were also used to describe the demographic characteristics of children served and to identify the neighborhoods where the organization serves large numbers of patients. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 7 Community demographics and social indicators Demographic characteristics Children's Minnesota has a broad reach; however, a majority of children served live in the seven -county Twin Cities metro area. For the purposes of this CHNA, Children's Minnesota has adopted the following definition to describe the community it serves: the community served by Children's Minnesota includes the more than 720,000 children (age 0-17) who live in the seven- county Twi n Cities metro area: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington counties. Demographics of children and their families There are high- level differences between counties. Ramsey and Hennepin counties are home to the largest number of children and most racially and ethnically diverse populations. In Ramsey County, a majority ( 58%) of children are children of color, compared to 48% in Hennepin County (Figure 1) . Throughout the Twin Cities , a relatively small percentage of children ( 2-9%) were born outside of the United States. However, at least one in 10 children (10- 31%) live in a household where the primary language spoken is not E nglish . 1.

According to the Minnesota Department of Education Student Enrollment Data (2020 -21), the most common household languages (spoken by at least 2,000 students) include: English, Spanish, Somali, Hmong, Karen, Vietnamese, Oromo and Arabic. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 8 Given that Children's Minnesota serves a high volume of patients under age 6, demographic information for children in this age group are provided separately below . However, data patterns are similar to the age 0-17 group (Figure 2). 2.

According to the Minnesota Department of Education Student Enrollment Data (2020- 21), the most common household languages for K-12 students (spoken by at least 2,000 students) include: English, Spanish, Somali, Hmong, Karen, Vietnamese, Oromo and Arabic. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 9 The seven -county Twin Cities metro area is growing in population and increasing in racial and ethnic diversity. Since 1990, both the number of children and cultural diversity of children and families have increased in all counties and these tre nds are expected to continue. Population changes may influence how Children's Minnesota provides services, hires its workforce, or develops partnerships with community organizations in order to provide affordable, high quality, culturally responsive care i n an increasingly diverse region. Since 1990, the most notable increases in population have been among children who are Hispanic/Latino, Black and multiracial (Figure 3). The trends listed below may not reflect the population changes in each of the many di fferent cultural groups that fall within each race and ethnicity category. 3.

The Southeast Asian category includes those who identified their race as Asian and reported belonging to any of the following ancestry groups: Burmese, Cambodian, Filipino, Hmong, Indonesian, Laotian, Malaysian, Taiwa nese, Thai, or Vietnamese. The category Asian (other) incl udes those who identified their race as Asian but did not report belonging to the anc estry groups listed previously. Additional analysis (not included in the figure above) of American Indian data from the U.S. Census in 2000 and 2020 showed that while ther e was a decrease in the number of children who identified as American Indian only during that timeframe, the number of children whose race was identified as American Indian and another race increased from approximately 14,000 to approximately 22,000. 9,624 5,361American Indian (alone)15,276American Indian (alone or 2015-2019 Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 10 Children as a proportion of the population Although the number of children living in the Twin Cities metro area has increased since 1990, children continue to make up nearly one -quarter of the overall population. In 2020, nearly 729,000 children age 0 -17 lived in the Twin Cities metro area, compared to nearly 593,000 in 1990 (Figure 4). At the same time, the number of adults age 65 and older has been and will continue to increase dramatically as the baby boomer generation ages. As a result of these demographic shifts, within the next decade the number of adults age 65 and older will be greater than the number of school -age children living in the Twin Cities metro area (Figure 5). This demographic change has the pot ential to influence how resources and funding are allocated at the state and local level. 4.

While Minnesota has proportiona lly fewer immigrants than the United States as a whole (8%, compared with 14% nationally), the state's foreign -born population is increasing faster than the national average. More than 470,000 residents are foreign born, with 79% of these residents living in the Twin Cities metro area . In 2019, 20% of children in Minnesota were either a child of an immigrant or were themselves born in a different country; in 2000 that was true of just 10% of children. The largest numbers of immigrants and refugees come from the following countries: Mexico, Somalia, India, Laos, Ethiopia, Vietnam, China, Thailand, Korea, Kenya and Liberia.3 Languages spoken at home In the Twin Cities metro area , 20% of school -age children live in a household where a language other than Englis h is spoken as the primary language. These percentages are higher in the region's most diverse school districts. Hennepin County, the largest of the seven counties in the region, has the most children who speak languages other than English in their homes (Figure 6). (Readers should note that the data below differ from the language data in Figure 2 because they are from two different sources.) There are not good measures available that describe the degree to which institutions, schools and other organizations have the linguistic and cultural capacity to meet the needs of all children and families. 6.

Income, wealth and employment In the Twin Cities metro area, health outcomes for children living in more affluent households are better than those for children in lower income households. Family income and wealth impact child health and well -being in multiple ways, influenci ng access to resources (e.g., safe housing, nutritious foods, clean water and air) and levels of stress. While Minnesota has historically had a strong economy and one of the lowest poverty rates in the nation, significant income 3 Integrate d Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (2015 - 2019 five -year estimates). Generated by Minnesota Compass. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 12 disparities exist among rac ial and ethnic groups. Across the state, poverty rates are higher for households headed by residents of color (double the statewide rate) or a single female (triple the statewide rate).4 Beyond income differences, long- term effects of discriminatory policies and practices (e.g., housing policy discrimination, employment discrimination, racial discrimination in the criminal justice system and unequal access to education opportunities) are m ajor drivers of disparities in household wealth. While local data on wealth were not gathered as part of this assessment, these same discriminatory policies have been in place in Minnesota and the Twin Cities metro area, disproportionately impacting people of color . Household income and wealth Nearly 200,000 children in the Twin Cities metro area live in households with incomes at or near the poverty level . Children who live in households below the poverty level are eligible to receive certain public assistance benefits. \"Lower -income households\" refers to households with an annual income at or below the federal poverty l evel (FPL). This is the threshold used in eligibility guidelines for some state benefit programs. As of 2020 (for a family of four), 100% FPL was $26,075 per year and 200% FPL was $52,150 per year. After more notable increases in the percentage of children living in lower -income households between 2000 and 2014, there has been a decrease since then for most counties (Figure 7). Despite these decreases, poverty rat es among children are still high in the Twin Cities metro area. Nearly half (45%) of children living in Ramsey County and 29% of children in Hennepin County live in lower -income households . The Ramsey County percentage is more than four times higher than C arver County (the most affluent county in the region) where 10% of children live in lower -income households . There are also concentrated areas of poverty within counties, including the CHNA's focal neighborhoods in Minneapolis and St. Paul (Figure 8). 4 Minn esota Compass. (2019). Economy overview .

Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 15 Racial disparities in income levels are evident; Black and American Indian children more often live in lower - income households and experience poverty, especially when compared to White child ren. In 2019, 33% of Black children and 35% of American Indian children lived in households with incomes at or below the f ederal poverty level, whereas only 4% of White children lived in lower -income households (Figure 9). Between 2014 and 2019, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of children living below the federal poverty level for all racial and ethnic groups except American Indian. 9.

Disaggregating data by cultural community can provide further insight into the economic circumstances impacting the health and well -being of children. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the number of residents living at or near federal poverty levels for a number of cultural communities in Minnesota, which helps illustrate a few important points: Differences in socioeconomic status vary widely across cultural communities. These differences reflect the varied experiences of people who today call Minnesota home, including how groups have been impacted by historical events and many different types of policies, including immigration policy (Figure 11). There are wide differences in experiences of cultural groups often reported together within a single race category (e.g., Chinese and Hmong residents grouped together in a single Asian race category). Nearly 65,000 White children live below the federal poverty line, more than other cultural groups. However, this com prises only 7% of the White childhood population.

Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 18 Employment As of 2019, the majority of Minnesota adults (age 16-64) were employed and employment has remained relatively flat over the past two decades (Figure 12). Two major disruptions to employment trends include the 2008 Great Recession and the current COVID -19 pandemic. During the 2008 recession, the proportion of adults working dropped to their lowest levels since 2000, especially in Hennepin and Ramsey counties (73% and 71%, respectively). 12.

In April 2020, the number of continuing unemployment insurance claims in Minnesota skyrocketed to 500,246 - a record high. Compared to April of the previous year, this represents a 978% increase in claims filed across the state and a 1,481% increase for the seven- county Twin Cities metr o area. Figure 13 illustrates the number of continuing unemployment claims in April for three years, starting with the year prior to the pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, record unemployment and the loss of jobs in certain sectors (e.g., food and beverage servers, retail workers), laid bare economic and racial disparities. While unemployment most directly impacts adults, households in which a parent or caregiver has experienced a loss or reduction in income will certainly have ripple effects on health outc omes for children and youth. 13.

In Minneapolis and St. Paul , the lasting impacts of discriminatory housing practices can be seen today by compari ng \"redlined\" districts established decades ago to current areas of concentrated poverty (Figure 1 5). Redlining refers to a set of practices established by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), other government agencies and private banks to label neighborhoods based on their perceived credit risk. Mortgage loan applications were regularly approved for (predominantly White ) people living in suburban areas or other neighborhoods with high credit ratings and denied for residents living in areas identified as \"declining \" neighborhoods, often areas with many residents of color. As a result of these policies, households of color rec eived just 2% of the FHA loans made between 1934 and 1968.6 Without homeownership, lower -income residents have very fewer options to increase wealth and financia l stability and decrease intergenerational poverty. In addition, the pandemic and extremely tight housing market (i.e., high housing prices) have made it more difficult for Minnesotans to purchase homes. As a result of historical redlining policies and disparities in income, access to credit and other forms of struct ural racism, there is a significant homeownership gap today . In the Twin Cities metro area , just over one- quarter of Black householders own their own homes, which is the lowest percentage among all racial and ethnic groups. Homeownership rates are higher among other minority groups , including Hispanic/Latino and American Indian householders (both 43%), householders of two or more races (45%) and Asian householders (58%), but still are much lower than the homeownership rate for White , non- Hispanic householders (76%).7 5 Boehm , T., & Schlottmann , A.

Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 23 Housing stability When families need to spend a large amount of their income on housing, it can impact their ability to pay for other basic needs. A household is considered housing cost -burdened when 30% or more of its monthly gross income is dedicated to housing expenses, including rent or mortgage payments, taxes and utilities. In a ll Twin Cities metro area counties , the percentage of cost -burdened households decreased from 2014 to 2019. In 2019, Ramsey County had the largest percentage of cost -burdened households (31%), while Carver County had the fewest cost - burdened households (20 %; Figure 16 ). 16.

In 2019, just over 376,000 Twin Cities metro households lived in rental properties, including apartments and rental homes. Of those households renting in the region, 46% were cost -burdened; for homeowners, the percentage was 18% (Figure 17 ). 17.

A report by the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunit y looks in depth at how housing and education policies have reinforced neighborhood segregation.8 The authors identify a number of key governmental decisions and policy initiatives that have increased or reinforced neighborhood segregation, including polic ies that have increased affordable housing goals for Minneapolis and St. Paul while at the same time decreasing these goals in more affluent, majority -White suburbs and revisions to the state's school desegregation rules. Another study from University of Minnesota pointed out that racially concentrated areas of affluence, which are census tracts where high proportions of residents are White and wealthy, may lead to lower empathy among White residents, potentially inhibiting policies and other efforts that would aim to reduce citywide or regional racial inequalities.9 8 Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity.

Every three years, Wilder Research conducts a study where volunteers across the state interview as many individuals experiencing homelessness as possible on a single night, including people in shelters, transitional housing and in non- shelter locations such as encampments and drop- in service sites. In 2018, the study found that 3, 265 children were homeless with their parents, with an additional 192 living on their own. This count likely underestimates the number of children and youth experiencing homelessness since they are more likely to stay outside the shelter system, making them more difficult to find for the study. Overall, the number of homeless children decreased between 2015 and 2018, with a decrease of 1% for those with their parents and 10% for those on their own (Figure 20 ). Children experiencing homelessness or other types of housing instability are at higher risk for developmental and academic delay s, behavioral and socioemotional problems and child welfare system involvement, including out of home placement. Language skills, communication skills and mental health issues have been found to be of particular concern among young children experiencing homelessness, with effects above and beyond the effects of poverty.10 20.

Minnesota early childhood risk, reach, and resilience : Key indicators of early ch ildhood development in Minnesota, county by Community Health Needs Assessment Page 28 Access to resources and supports There are a number of resources and systems that support the health and well -being of children. Vibrant and healthy neighborhoods have a range of assets to support child health and development, including green spaces and parks where children can play and exercise, places to purchase healthy and affordable food, water and air free of pollution and high-quality schools. These neighborhood assets and other types of resources need to be available, accessible and welcoming to community residents. This section of the report highlights just a few of the many resources children and families access to support health. Public programs Many of the children and families eligible for public programs intended to support the health and well -being of children, especially those in lower -income households and neighborhoods, do not receive the resources they need to be healthy (Figure 21 ). Differences in enrollment by county can be the result of a number of factors, including disparities in who is reached through each county's outreach approach. There are many reasons families may choose not to particip ate in these programs, but these topics were not explored in this assessment. A full description of each program is located in the shaded box below. 21.

Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 29 Brief description of public programs and resources available to young children The Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) subsidies are available to working parents eligible for MFIP or from lower -income households to help cover the costs of child care. In some counties there are wait lists because there is more demand f or CCAP subsidies than funding available. Early Childhood Family Education (ECFE) is available in school districts across the state and provides parenting education to support children's learning and development. Expecting parents and families with childre n from birth to kindergarten age are eligible to participate. Early Childhood Screening is available to all children beginning at age 3 to evaluate their physical, verbal, cognitive and social -emotional development. State law requires screening to be compl eted within 30 days of enrollment to kindergarten. Early Learning Scholarships are intended to increase access to high quality early childhood programs for low-income families. The Family Home Visiting Program works with families with lower incomes (at or below 185% of federal poverty guidelines) who are experiencing other stressful situations, including poverty, past alcohol or drug use, or a history of abuse or neglect. In- home visits are provided by public health nurses or other trained staff and are intended to support healthy parent -child relationships and healthy child development. Head Start and Early Head Start are available to children with low household incomes, special health needs, or other specific circumstances, such as homelessness. These pr ograms provide young children (6 weeks to 5 years old) with services that support all aspects of child development and health. The Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP) supports low -income families (at or below 125% of the federal poverty level) with children. Parents are supported through cash and food assistance, as well as employment services. School Readiness Programs are available in all Minnesota school districts to help prepare children for kindergarten. The service is available to all children at a fee- for-service basis, while children who meet specific eligibility criteria can participate free of charge. The Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program provides pregnant women, as well as new mothers and their children, with nutrition education, br eastfeeding support and information, nutritious food and referrals to health and social services. Participation in the WIC program in Minnesota has consistently been high; in 2013 (the most recent data available) Minnesota participation was the 2nd highest in the nation, with 71% of women eligible for WIC enrolled in the program.

Census tracts identified as food deserts using the USDA Food Access Research Atlas are located in Minneapolis and St. Paul ; suburban cities including Brooklyn Center, New Hope, South St. Paul and Maplewood; and more rural areas, including areas in Carver and Dakota counties (Figure 22 ). 22.

Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 31 Food insecurity is of particular concern for young children as it can contribute to a variety of developmental challenges . For infants and toddlers experiencing food insecurity, this may include challenges related to the development of language, motor skills and cognitive functioning.11 Living in a food desert is just one indicator of food insecurity a family may be exper iencing. Families experiencing financial instability are also likely faced with difficult decisions about prioritizing how to meet their family's basic needs such as affording food, housing and transportation. Pre- pandemic, 13% of Hennepin County adults reported that they \"sometimes\" or \"often\" worried that food would run out before they had money to buy more.12 In the CHNA's focal neighborhoods of Phillips/Powderhorn, a higher percentage of adults (24%) reported worrying about being able to afford food. Across Hennepin County, the percentage of adults reporting food insecurity was higher for American Indians (49%), Hispanics (46%) and African Americans (43%), compared to Asians (31%) or White adults (10%) pre- pandemic. Loss of employment income along with di sruptions in supply chains have led to significant challenges around food in many communities during the pandemic. In Minnesota, people of color have been harder hit by food scarcity during the pandemic (18%) as compared to non- Hispan ic White people ( 5%) (Figure 23 ). 23.

Health care and insurance Having health insurance is currently the best way to ensure children have access to the health care services they need to support their growth and development. Services children access through health insurance include well-child check -ups and preventative care, services to address common childhood illnesses, as well as services for more severe conditions when hospitalization is required. Children lacking health coverage are less likely to access the services they need, which can have both short -term impacts , such as school absenteeism , as well as long- term impacts , such as serious illness and disability. 13,14 11 Carlson, E., Giovanelli, A., Chase , R., Spaeth, E., & Aviles, S.

Minnesota early childhood risk, reach, and resilience: Key indicators of ear ly childhood development in Minnesota, county by county . Community Health Needs Assessment Page 32 The majority of children living in the Twin Cities have health care insurance , but overall disparities in coverage still exist . The percentage of children in Twin Cities metro area counties that lack health care coverage is similar to the state overall ( 2-3% for both); however, that still means more than 20,000 children in the Twin Cities metro area are without coverage (Figure 2 4). This relatively low percentage is due in large part to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. By 2021 Minnesota had reach historically low uninsured rates for the state as a whole (4%) . Unfortunately , while rates for White Minnesotans decreased between 2019 and 2021 (3.7% to 2.4%), rates increased for people of color and American Indians (7.6% to 10.2%).15 However, just having health care coverage does not take into consideration t he quality of the health care plan , children who are covered by high deductible plans , or coverage that includes only the minimum requirements and may have inadequate coverage for their individual health care needs. While health insurance helps many famili es afford services that support health and well -being, multiple studies, including one conducted by Children's Minnesota on emergency department use, have demonstrated that a number of additional factors also impact access to health care services. 24.

U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2015- 2019 . Some r esidents in Hennepin and Ramsey counties face significant barriers accessing health care. Medically underserved areas (MUAs) are federally designated geographic areas where residents are underserved based on four criteria: ratio of primary care physicians to residents, infant mortality rate, percentage of residents living below the poverty level and the percentage of the population age 65 and over. In the Twin Cities metro area, all medically underserved neighborhoods are located in Hennepin and Ramsey counties: Payne- Phalen, Thomas - Dale, Dayton's Bluff and Summit -Dale neighborhoods in St. Paul and the Phillips, Northeast, Northside and Cedar -Riverside neighborhoods in Minneapolis.16 Additionally, Northeast and Northside neighborhoods are designated as primary health care professional shortage areas.17 The American Indian population in St. Paul is also designated as a medically underserved population (MUP), meaning it is a population with economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers that limit access to primary medical care services.18 While this designation is one way to identify groups with limited access to health care, additional information from community r esidents and stakeholders is needed to fully understand what contributes to these difficulties accessing services. 15 Minnesota Health Access Survey (2021). https://www.health.state.mn.us/data/economics/hasurvey/index.html 16 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).

While most of the patients served are infants to age 17, Children's Minnesota provides prenatal care and services to some young adults as they complete treatment for specific health issues. English, Spanish and Somali are the most common languages spoken by patients . In 2021, over 53,000 individual children received emergency department services and over 13,500 were admitted to the hospital. Patient data from the two hospitals combined show that children who receive emergency department services tend to be toddlers and school -age children, while infants are more likely to be admitted to the hospital (Figure 25 ). A more culturally and socioeconomically diverse patient population received emergency department services than those admitted for inpatient hospital care. Because measures of household income and poverty status are not routinely collected for all patients, this assessment uses enrollment in Medicaid as a proxy measure for lower -income hous eholds. More than half of patients who received emergency department (56%) or inpatient (51%) services had Medicaid as their primary source of insurance (Figure 26) . 25.

Children's primary care clinics located on the Minneapolis and St. Paul campuses reach a more culturally diverse patient population than the hospitals o r clinics located in other parts of the Twin Cities metro area. At the Minneapolis campus, 41% of children have a preferred household language other than Englis h, while the same is true for 20% of children at the St. Paul clinic (Figure 2 7). Over two -thirds of the patients seen at the Minneapolis and St. Paul clinics live in lower -income households, as estimated by enrollment in Medicaid ( 75% and 66%, respectively) (Figure 28) . This is a larger percentage of patients than at the other Children's Minnesota affiliated primary care clinics (13 -52%) (Figure 2 9). 27.

Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 37 There are specific Minneapolis and St. Paul neighborhoods, particularly lower -income areas of the two cities, that have a high density of children who receive services from Children's Minnesota . Almost 40% of children in the Phillips neighborhood in Minneapolis received some type of care from Children's Minnesota in 2021. In addition, more than one- third of children received services from Children's Minnesota in the Powderhorn and West Side neighborhoods. About a quarter of children in the Thomas -Dale and Dayton's Bluff neighborhoods received ser vices from Children's Minnesota (Figure 30). 30.

Young children (age 0- 5) are generally healthy but are at risk for some conditions , including developme ntal and behavioral disorders, child maltreatment, asthma and other chronic conditions, obesity , dental cavities and unintentional injuries.19 This summary presents prenatal indicators, as well as some measures of health and access to resources for young children and their families. It should be noted that there is little information available that describes the family and community strengths that support the health and well -being of young children. Prenatal and birth indicators Healthy childhood development begins during pregnancy. A total of 37,501 babies were born in the Twin Cities metro area in 2019. Forty -one percent of these births were in Hennepin County (Figure 31). The birth rate in the Twin Cities metro area is fairly close to the statewide average (11.7 births per 1,000 population). Overall birth rates in Minnesota have declined considerably since the 1960s when it peaked at 26.2 births per 1,000 population; this shift is thought to be largely due to economic changes and cultural shifts such as pe ople waiting longer to become pregnant.20 As with many other health indicators, it is important to consider the systemic factors that influence prenatal care and birth outcomes, most fundamentally the effects of structural racism and secondary factors like socioeconomic status. For example, structural racism was found to have increased the risk of adverse birth outcomes for U.S. -born Black Minnesotans compared to Whites in 2017, including pre- term birth, low birthweight and small -for-gestational -age birth, all of which shows up in the population health indicator data that follows.21 19 Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.

Across the seven -county Twin Cities metro area, as well as statewide, close to 80% of women receive prenatal care. Compared to 2010, some counties have shown a slight decrease in prenatal care during their first trimester (Figure 32 ). Prenatal care provided by d oulas may not be tracked and included in this indicator and may account for at least some of the decreases in percentages . 32.

As of 2017, the method used to determine the adequacy of prenatal care significant ly changed , resulting in an inability to compare previous year's data with that from 2017 onward. 22 The Adequacy of Prenatal Care (APNCU) 22 The method changed from the GINDEX to the Kotelchuck's Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization (APNCU) in keeping with the standards of national reporting. The APNCU results in a dif ferent distribution of the adequacy of prenatal care. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 40 measure defines adequate prenatal care as being initiated during the first four months of pregnancy and 80% or more of expected visits are attended for the remaining months of pregnancy. American Indian mothers have the highest percentage of inadequate prenatal care (29%), followed b y Black mothers (18%) (Figure 33 ). Barriers that reduce accessibility of health care services or services provided by doulas may be contributing factors to these disparities. 33.

Note. Adequacy is determined using the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization (APNCU) Index and is not comparable to GINDEX Index used in previous years. Smoking during pregnancy Smoking while pregnant increases the risk of infant morbidity and mortality.23 Twin Cities metro area counties have lower proportions of people who smoke while pregnant than the state average (7%; Figure 34 ). Anoka has the highest percentage of prenatal smoking in the metro at 6 %; however , this is still much lower than counties such as Aikin, Beltrami, Cass, Clearwater, Mahnomen, Mille Lacs and Pine that have the highest rates in the state at 24 -42%. 34.

Alcohol consumption during pregnancy leads to an estimated 8,500 Minnesota infants born each year with prenatal alcohol exposure and 3,400 babies who will live with a fetal alcohol substance disorder.26 The opioid epidemic continues to create concern about Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) in Minnesota. In Minnesota, NAS is present in about 10 per 1,000 births . Adverse birth outcomes Low birthweight babies weigh less than 2,500 grams (approximately 5 \u00bd pounds) at birth. These babies are at greater risk for health problems, particularly during their first year of life and are more likely to have developmental complications, which can lead to longer -term difficulties with scho ol performance and other outcomes. Teen mothers, especially those younger than 15 and mothers in poorer health are more likely to give birth to a low birthweight baby, but any premature birth can result in low birth weight. In 2019, about 4,500 infants wer e born at low birthweight in Minnesota. Higher proportions of women of color, especially African American women (11%), had low -weight births, compared to White , non- Hispanic women (6%; Figure 35 ). 35.

There has been a steady decrease in the rate of infant deaths over time in Minnesota and across all Twin Cities metro area counties (Figure 36). Ideally, no infant deaths should occur. Healthy People 2020 established a national goal to reduce the number of infant deaths to no more than 6 per 1,000 births; all counties now meet this national benchmark , except for Ramsey County which fell slightly short of this target. 24 Proof Alliance.

Postneonatal mortality is the death of a live- born infant from the infant's 28th day of life to one year of age. These deaths reflect events in infancy and are more likely to reflect social or environmental factors. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 43 Early childhood indicators There are multiple systems and supports in place to help parents and caregivers support the health and well - being of young children (age 0- 5). Regular pediatric appointments are recommended for young children to screen for potential health concerns and to receive preventive care, including vaccinations. These early visits with providers are opportunities to screen for developmental concerns and for caregivers to learn information about how to support their child's health and development. There are also a number of public programs in place that help caregivers with l ower income levels access resources to support the development of young children. However, there are relatively few sources of information in place that describe the health and wellness of young children, particularly the family strengths and community assets in place that support their health and overall development. This section of the summary includes measures of early childhood health before focusing on various social determinants of health that can influence health and wellness. Immunizations The World Health Organization declared \"vaccine hesitancy,\" the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services, as one of the 10 threats to global health in 2019.27 Wadena and Renville counties in Minnesota have been identified as having higher rates of parents opting for \"nonmedical\" exemptions for school - required vaccinations. In February 2019, a bill was introduced in Minnesota that would provide funding for outreach to groups with lower vaccination rates to educate them on the benefits of vac cines.28 Sixty -nine percent of young children in Minnesota completed the recommended childhood immunization series in 2019 (Figure 3 8). The Minnesota Department of Health recommends that children receive vaccinations before age 3 to prevent a range of diseases. Although the percentage of young children across the Twin Cities metro area who complete the recommended childhood series has increased since 2016, Minnesota has not met the Healthy People 2020 goals for completing the recommended childhood series (80% of children) by age 3. 29 Additionally, Dakota, Hennepin and Ramsey counties fall below the state percentage of children with a complete childhood series. Immunizations may be missed if children have difficulty accessing health care services or if caregiv ers refuse vaccinations for their child. 38.

The Minnesota Department of Health reported there were a total of 49 reported measles cases in 2021, which was up from 13 in 2020 (but significantly lower than 1,282 cases in 2019).30 In 2017, there was a measles outbreak connected with the Somali -American community in Minnesota. P ublic health officials attributed the outbreak to a steep decrease in vaccination rates within this community due to \"anti -vaccine\" efforts (92% vaccination rate in 2004 versus 42% in 2014) .31 It is important to note there has also been an emerging trend nationally of affluent, White parents choosing not to vaccinate.32 Children age 5 and up became eligible to receive the COVID -19 vaccine on October 29, 2021. As of May 2022, 37% of children age 5 through 11 had received the vaccine (Figure 39). 39. Minnesotans age 5+ who have a completed COVID -19 vaccine series (as of 5/19/22) , by age Source.

In Minnesota, Child and Teen Checkup providers are required to screen blood lead levels in children at 12 and 24 months of age.34 According to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) \"lead testing is not universal in Minnesota\" and children with risk factors (such as older housing or poverty status) are targeted for testing. 2017 MDH data show that 81 % of children in Minnesota had received blood lead testing by 3 years of age. The rate of children being tested has increased dramatically over the past two decades. In the Twin Citi es metro area, it rose from 42% in 2000 to 87% in 2017.35 Each year, nearly 700 Minnesota children have EBLLs. Children who live in homes built before 1978 are most at risk due to the likelihood these homes have lead -based paint.36 Compared to other areas of the state, the Minneapolis/ St. Paul area has the highest percent age of young children with elevated blood lead levels, although it has been trendi ng downward over time (Figure 44 ). 44.

The definition of an elevated blood lead level recently changed from 10 to 5 mcg/dL (micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood). The reference level was lowered in 2011 to identify children with levels much higher than most children. 34 Minne sota Department of Health. (2022).

Adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, refer to a set of issues including abuse, neglect, caregiver mental illness, caregiver incarceration and divorce that studies have shown to have long- term negative impacts on health.37 While there are not sources of data available that describe the number of young children currently impacted by these events in most areas, child maltreatm ent and foster care records are available for this young age group. (See the \"School -age youth key health indicators\" section for additional information on ACEs in older children, including disparities.) Child maltreatment can include physical, emotional and sexual abuse, as well as neglect by a parent or caregiver. Children under age 5 are more likely to experience neglect than older children and are at greatest risk for injury and death from abuse. Maltreatment reports by county include both family invest igations and assessments,38 as well as facility investigations. The rate of maltreatment reports involving young children in 2016 was highest in Hennepin (44 per 1,000 children) and Ramsey (30 per 1,0 00 children) counties (Figure 4 5). Rates have increased across metro- area counties and statewide. This increase likely reflects both an actual change in rates of maltreatment (e.g., drug- related maltreatment reports have increased since 2013, especially in the number of reports related to chronic parental drug use in the seven- county Twin Cities metro area) and changes in required reporting (e.g., a 2015 law requires local agencies to follow revised screening and reporting guidelines).39 45.

The removal of a child from their caregiver and home, as well as the instability of placements after a child enters the child welfare system, can be very stressful for children, lead to gaps in care and exacerbate existing health and mental health conditions. In the Twin Cities metro area, the rate of foster care placement for young children was higher in both Hennepin and Ramsey counties (11.0 per 1,000) than other counties, although lower than all of Minn esota (12.5 per 1,000; Figure 46 ). Overall, rates for foster care placements have increased since 2013 (with the exception of Carver County). The reasons for this increase in Minnesota foster care placements are in part due to increased parental substance use, leading to more children in need of foster care.40 Additionally, the median length of time children are staying in out -of-home care has increased. This is largely because the cases for children who are removed due to parental substance use typically take longer to reach permanency as parents work through recovery issues.41 46.

Early childhood education Access to high quality early education is critical to the academic success of students. A recent study reviewing decades of research on early childhood education found that , compared to children who did not access those program s, children who participated in early childhood education had fewer special education placements, decreased grade retention and improved high school graduation rates.42 In Minnesota, Early Head Start, Head Start, Early Childhood Family Education, Child Care Assistance Program, Early Learning Scholarships, Child Care Assistance Program Voluntary Pre- K and School Readiness are some of the public programs available to help young children access high -quality early learning programs and develop ski lls to be successful in school. 40 Minnesota Department of Human Services.

Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 51 School -age youth, key health indicators This section describes the health needs and priorities for school -age children and adolescents, age 6 to 18, living in the seven- county Twin Cities metro area. The information cited includes the most recent data available, broken out in as much detail as possible (e.g., most local geography available, most detailed race/ethnicity categories). Health disparities observable through these available data sources are noted throughout. Education There is a strong association between education and health. Adults with higher levels of education tend to have lower rates of most acute and chronic illnesses and have higher levels of functioning as they age. There are multiple factors that contribute to this relationship: people with higher levels of education are more likely to have higher - paying jobs; less likely to live in poverty; and less likely to smoke, drink heavily, or be overweight or obese (all factors that contribute to chronic disease). The COVID -19 pandemic has had a drastic impact on educational systems and related outcomes for children and youth. As stated in the introduction, most of the data in this report represent a pre-pandemic landscape; however, it is important to note that major shifts in academic practice will influence educational outcomes for years to come. Because of the pandemic, most Minnesota schools (including all St. Paul and Minneapolis public schools) closed in mid-March 2020 and pivoted to distance learning. Many remained in distance learning through the middle of the next academic year ( 20-21), meaning that children and youth had to navigate their education virtually for about nine months, possibly without consistent adult support (e.g., parents and caregivers having to work) or resources (e.g., high-speed Internet). In addition, the Minnesota Department of Education used a federal waiver to cancel the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments (MCA) in the 20- 21 academic year, so typical student data, such as reading and math scores, are unavailable for that year of the pandemic. While COVID -19 undoubtedly exacerbated existing health disparities, the lack of available current data makes it challenging to assess the full impact of the pandemic on school -age youth. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 52 High school graduation Academic data have consistently shown an achievement gap between White students and students of color, which has persisted over time. Graduating from high school is an important step that supports overall health and wellness into adulthood. However, there are notable disparities in on- time graduation, particular ly in Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS) and St. Paul Public Schools (SPPS), the districts where Children's Minnesota's two hospital campuses are located. Graduation rates for MPS (74%) and SPPS (76%) students are lower than the statewid e average overall (83%; Figure 47 ) and there are large differences in graduation rates by race. While graduation rates have improved over time for all racial grou ps (from 2012 to 2020; Figure 4 8), there are deeply rooted, historical inequities in the education system that will require large systems changes to fix. Additionally , the recent pandemic has exacerbated these inequities. 47.

A report prepared by the Minnesota Education Equity Partnership calls out the need to addres s broader issues of \"segregation and integration, intersections of race and economic class and White dominance in K -12 and teacher education\" to understand and change the opportunity gaps that impact students and families.43 While the COVID -19 pandemic affected many aspects of education, high school graduation rates by race and ethnicity in 2021 are simil ar to graduation rat es in 2020 (Figure 49). Test scores While sta ndardized testing has its limitations, test scores can be predictive of future outcomes, such as college attendance, adult earnings and health.44,45 According to the most recent data available, there was a decrease in student test scores between 2019 and 202 1, suggesting that the pandemic affected student learning and achievement. (Minnesota did not administer standardized tests during the 2020 school year.) Specifically, the percentage of 3rd and 8th grade students meeting reading and math standards, respect ively, fell both in the Twin Cities and in the state overall (Figures 49 and 50 ). 49.

Overall health and well- being Over 60% of ninth grade students in each of the Twin Cities metro counties rate their overall health as \"very good\" or \"excellent\" (Figure 5 1). Overall health ratings are similar across the seven -county Twin Cities metro area (61% -66% across counties said \"very good\" or \"ex cellent\" and are comparable to the statewide average (63%).

A notable difference in self -confidence between males and females has remained the same since 2016; 73% of ninth grade male students reported they \"often\" or \"almost always\" felt good about themselves, compared with 49% of female students (Figure 52 ). This is consistent with studies that look at changes in self - esteem across the lifespan. On average, self -esteem is relatively high in childhood and drops during adolescence (particularly for girls) before rising again in adulthood.46 Differences in body satisfaction are one of the main factors that contribute to gender differences in self -esteem in adolescence.47 52.

Less than half of ninth grade students feel they have other caring adults in their lives. Positive connections to non- family adults are important to the health and wel l-being of youth.

This section draws from statewide analyses of MSS data completed by the Minnesota Department of Health and SUMN (Substance Use in Minnesota)49 to describe how often youth experience ACEs, how ACEs impact youth well -being and how family and community strengths can reduce the negative impacts of ACEs. Their analyses include d Minnesota students in grades 8, 9 and 11 who completed the Minnesota Student Survey in 2019. Description and prevalence The eight ACEs items included in the MSS are: incarceration of parent/caregiver; living with someone who drinks too much alcohol; living with someone who is depressed or has mental health issues; living with someone who uses illegal drugs or abuses prescription drugs; verbal abuse; physical abuse; household domestic abuse; and sexual abuse. While a majority of Minnesota children (52%) have not experienced any of these ACEs, a substantial portion have experienced at least one ACE (48%). About 23% experienced one ACE, 11% experienced two ACEs, 6% experienced three ACEs and 7% experienced four or more ACEs. Twenty -six percent of students live with someone who was depressed or has mental health issues. Mental health issues is the most commonly reported ACE. Sixteen per cent of students experienced a parent or caregiver being incarcerated at some point in their life. Parental incarceration was the second most commonly reported ACE. Other common ACEs include verbal abuse (15%), alcohol abuse (11%) and physical abuse (13%) . Fewer children experienced witnessing domestic abuse (8%), sexual abuse (6%), or living with someone who abuses drugs (5%). Students with multiple ACEs are more likely to report using substances. Students reporting 4+ ACEs are 5.2 times more likely to r eport e -cigarette use, 8.9 times more likely to report marijuana use and 12.6 times more likely to report prescription drug misuse. Students with multiple ACEs are more likely to report poor mental health and suicidal behavior. Students with 4+ ACEs are 3.4 times more likely to report feeling down, depressed, or hopeless in the past two weeks (49% compared to 14%). Additionally, 46% of students with 4+ ACEs reported suicidal ideation (compared to 4% with zero ACEs) and 20% reported suicide attempts (compar ed to 1% with zero ACEs). 49 SUMN (Substance Use in Minnesota) provides data on over 100 indicators related to alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use (www.sumn.org ). It is a project of the Minnesota State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup, a collaborative effort across multiple state agencies and EpiMachine, LLC, and includes representatives from state agencies, coalitions, and other local organizations. Data in th is summary were retrieved from https://www.pcamn.org/wp - content/uploads/2020/07/MINNESOTA -ACEs -Fact-Sheet -2020.pdf Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 58 Impacts on health and well -being Initial research on the impact of ACEs found that there is a relationship between the number of ACEs experienced in childhood and increased risk of several poor outcomes in adulthood, including: alcoholism, drug use, mental health issues (e.g., depression), chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, liver disease), higher risk sexual activity, poor academic/ work performance and lower quality of life.50 The same patterns can be found in Minnesota: adults who experienced multiple ACEs in childhood are more likely to report their own health as \"fair\" or \"poor,\" to use tobacco products and overuse alcohol and to be diagnosed with depression or anxiety.51 The study also found that adults who experienced five or more ACEs were more likely to be unemployed and feel financial stress. While the initial study focused on ACEs ' impact on health outcomes in adulthood, ACEs have more immediate impact on youth health and well -being. When ACEs occur, particularly if they occur repeatedly or over long periods of time, children experience toxic stress which can impact brain development, influencing behavior, learning, relationships, memory and overall health. In Minnesota, for example, youth who have more ACEs are more likely to report mental health concerns and use alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs.52 ACEs are an important, but not exhaustive, list of factors that can lead to poor health outcomes. For example, chronic poverty and its impacts on housing, food security and access to resources can lead to chronic stress and poor health. Children and families who come to the United States as immigrants and refugees experience stress as they learn about living in a new culture and interacting with new systems. This i s in addition to the chronic stress that some families experienced in their home country. Structural racism, experiences of direct racism or discrimination and historical trauma are also experiences that impact people of color and American Indians, but these topics are not asked about in surveys that are used to describe ACEs and their impacts. Factors that reduce ACE impacts Although ACEs can have profound short - and long- term impacts on health and well -being, community and familial strengths and assets c an offset the negative impacts of ACEs. Nurturing relationships, connections with supportive and caring adults, ensuring basic needs are met and nurturing the social emotional development of children are all examples of protective factors that can reduce t he negative impacts of ACEs. SUMN's analyses of MSS data showed that strong families and communities minimize the impacts of ACEs in Minnesota: Among students with two or more ACEs, students with greater educational engagement are less likely to report suicidal ideation in the past year (27% versus 38% for students with lower educational engagement). Students with two or more ACEs who feel teachers or other adults in the community care about them are 14 to 16 percentage points less likely to report suicida l ideation in the past year than students who do not feel they have that support. In an ideal world, no child would experience abuse, neglect and other traumatizing events. While working to prevent ACEs from occurring, it is important to help teachers, health care providers and others who work closely with children increase their understanding of ACEs and how these events can impact development and child behavior (a trauma- informed approach), as well as to support efforts that foster community and family strengths and assets. 50 Violence Prevention.

Therefore, this section of the summary focuses primarily on conditions that can be managed or prevented by changes in behavior or environment; however, the last section als o discusses reasons for premature death. Asthma Asthma is one of the leading causes of absenteeism from school. A number of factors can trigger an asthma episode, including air pollution, exposure to allergens, exercise, tobacco smoke and chemical irritants. Across the seven counties in the Twin Cities metro area, 12% -18% of ninth grade students have been told they have asthma.53 American Indian and African American middle and high school students are more likely to have been diagnosed with asthma and rates of optimal asthma control are significantly lower for Asian, Black, American Indian and Latinx children (compared to rates for all children); and for children whose preferred language is Hmong, Karen , or Spanish (compared to the state average) .54, 55 The rate of asthma- related hospitalizations is higher in Minneapolis and St. Paul than in other parts of the metro region, particularly in the downtown areas of each city and nearby neighborhoods (Near North and Phillips neighborhoods in Minneapolis, Summit -University neighborhood in St. Paul , Camden in Minneapolis, Payne/Phalen in St. Paul and Summit -University -Frogtown in St. Paul ).56 Emergency department (ED) visits due to asthma are also higher for children in the Twin Cities metro area compared to children in greater Minnesota; however , ED visits appear to have declined between 2015 and 2019 (Figure 5 4). 54.

Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a mix of chemicals in the air that results from burning tobacco (cigarettes, cigars, pipes) and from exhal ed smoke. ETS or second- hand smoke causes cancer and no level of exposure is considered safe. ETS is particularly harmful to children. In the 2017 Minnesota Youth Tobacco Survey, almost half (47%) of nonsmoking Minnesotan youth in grades 6- 12 were exposed to ETS in any of the surveyed settings (home, car, at school, at work, or in a public place) in the previous week. Public places (33%) were the most common settings for exposure to secondhand smoke, followed by in the car (17%), in the home (16%), at school (15%) 53 Minnesota Department of Education. (2019).

Diabetes and contributing factors In the seven- county Twin Cities metro area, approximately 1% of ninth grade students have been told they have diabetes; the Minnesota Student Survey asks students about diabetes , generally and does not differentiate between Type I and Type II.58 This may be an underestimate of the prevalence of the disease. A much larger percentage of students have an increased risk of developing diabetes because of their weight or health behaviors. One- quarter of Minnesota ninth grade students are overweight or obese, with Ramsey County having the largest percentage of youth who are obese (12%; Figure 55 ). The percentage of students who are overweight or obese changed little from 2016, staying the same or changing by a few percentage points, depending on the county. 55. Weight status of ninth graders, by county (2019) County Normal or underweigh t Minnesota Student Survey, 2019. http://w20.education.state.mn.us/MDEAnalytics/DataTopic.jsp?TOPICID=242. Note. Weight status was based on body mass index (BMI) calculated using students' self -reported height and weight. Similar to 2013 and 2016 survey results, relatively few ninth grade students meet recommended guidelines for physical activity and healthy eating. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends that children age 6 to 17 should be physically active for at least 60 minutes each day. Only 17% of ninth grade students in the state meet these physical activity requirements. In its food pyramid, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends that school -age children consume at least two servings of fruit and three s ervings of vegetables a day. Approximately one- third of ninth graders across Twin Cities metro area counties are meeting fruit serving recommendations and even fewer are meeting vegetable serving recommendations (7%-14% across counties; Figure 5 6). A numb er of factors contribute to how easily students can be physically active and follow a healthy diet, including the availability and affordability of resources that support health, the safety of their outdoor play spaces and comfort or experience with exercise and meal preparation. 57 Minnesota Department of Health.

In 2019, among y ounger children (age 0- 5) the leading cause of death was perinatal conditions, followed by congenital anomalies and unintentional injury (Figure 5 7).

Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 63 Mental health At least 21% of ninth grade students reported having a long -term mental health, behavioral, or emotional problem in all Twin Cities metro counties. The percentage of students reporting a mental health problem across the state has increased since 2016 from 17% to 23% (Figure 58). Among ninth grade students in Minnesota, females are more likely than males to report having any long- term mental health, behavioral, or emotional problems (30% compared to 16%, respectively).59 Results from the College Student Health Survey conducted by the University of Minnesota showed 42% of students reported having a mental health diagnosis in their lifetime in 2018, compared to 25% of students in 2007.60 This observed increase may not be a change in actual prevalence; reduced stigma around mental illness may make youth more willing to discuss problems they are experiencing and seek treatment. 58.

Over the past two decades ( 1999 to 2017) , suicide deaths have increased nationally and in Minnesota. Suicide rates are increasing across demographic groups and Minnesota's youth ( age 15-24) suicide rate is higher than the youth suicide rate nationally (14.7 per 100,000 compared to 12.8 per 100,000). 61 White, non- Hispanic, males accounted for two- thirds (67%) of all suicides among Minnesota youth (and 81% of all male suicides among Minnesota youth). Between 2015 and 2016, Minnesota males ( age 15-24) were over four times more likely to die by suicide compared to females in this same age group. Suicide rates have increased for all races, with the highest increase (61%) in the American Indian community ( 57 suicides in 2008 -2012 and 98 suicides in 2013 -2017 across Minnesota).62 Statewide, there has been an increase in non-fatal self-inflicted injury (SII) for all age groups (from 6,552 cases in 2012 to 9,581 cases in 2017). In 2017, over half of all SII were among youth and young adults (10 -24 years) and females had higher numbers of SII compared to males across all age groups. The most common mechanisms of non- fatal SII were poisoning and cutting/piercing.63 59 Minnesota Department of Education (2019) . 2019 Minnesota Student Survey statewide tables , 2013- 2019. http://w20.education.state.mn.us/MDEAnalytics/DataTopic.jsp?TOPICID=11 60 University of Minnesota.

In 2019, ninth grade students were less likely to have used alcohol (21%) or marijuana (10%) compared to 11th graders (37% and 16% respectively; Figure 59 ). In contrast, there was little difference in the percentage of ninth and 11th grade students who reported misusing a prescription drug in the past 30 days (4% for both grades).64 59.

In 1992, nearly two- thirds (64%) of ninth grade students in Minnesota reported using alcohol in the pas t year, compared to 21% in 2019.65, 66 64 The MSS asks students how often, in the past 30 days, they have used prescription drugs that were not prescribed to them. This item on prescription drug misuse was first added to the survey in 2013. There is not a question comparable to the alco hol and marijuana survey items that asks about any misuse during the past year. 65 Minnesota Departments of Education, Health, Human Ser vices, & Public Safety.

The most common reasons youth gave for using e-cigarettes included: a friend or family member used them (11%); e- cigarettes come in flavors such as mint, candy, fruit, or chocolate (10%); they were curious about e- cigarettes (8%); and e-cigarett es are less harmful than other forms of tobacco (6%).67 60.

Minnesota Student Survey, 2019. https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/tobacco/data/docs/2019_mss_tobacco.pdf . Most e- cigarette products contain nicotine, which contributes to deficits in cognitive development in youth and is highly addictive.68 However, even more concerning in recent years are the severe lung injuries and even deaths, being attributed to e- cigarette use.69 Unfortunately , many youth seem to be unaware of the risks of e- cigarettes , with 71% of ninth graders saying there was either no, slight, or a moderate risk to using e- cigarettes.70 Analysis from the Minnesota Youth Tobacco Survey finds that youth with asthma are more likely to use conventional tobacco products or e- cigarettes when compared to youth without asthma. Thi s finding is concerning as youth with asthma who use tobacco are less likely to have their asthma symptoms controlled and may require subsequent medical interventions.71 67 Minnesota Department of Health.

In 2019, there were 612 births to teenagers age 15- 17 and three times as many births (n=1,932) to teenagers age 18- 19. The same trend in decreased teen births has occurred nationally, likely due to teenagers waiting longer before becoming sexually active and the increased use of more effective contraceptiv e methods.72 In Minnesota, birth rates have decreased am ong adolescents in all racial groups. Although pregnancy and birth rates are highest among adolescents of color in Minnesota, the largest number of adolescent births is among White youth. 61.

Data are suppressed (**) in counties where racial/ethnic groups are too small to calculate reliable estimates. Sexually transmitted infections Though adolescents (age 15- 19) account for only 7% of the population in Minnesota, they accounted for 25% of chlamydia and 16% of gonorrhea cases in 2020.72 High rates of STIs among this age group are likely the result of limited access to prevention services and lack of comfort seeking services, including concerns about confidentiality. The chlamydia incidence rate for adolescents (age 15- 19) increased from 2008 to 2020 (from 1,164 to 1,503 adolescents infected per 100,000 population). While there was a steep drop in chlamydia rates from 2019 to 2020 (1,696 to 1,503), it is possible that less routine screening during the pandemic may account for this decrease. Gonorrhea incidence rates have fluctuated over the same time period, but were the highest rates in over 10 years in 2020 (452 adolescents infected per 100,000 population).73 73 Farris, J., & Sullivan, O.

In 2019, 10 % of Minnesota ninth graders identified their sexuality as something other than heterosexual (bisexual: 5%, lesbian: 1%; Figure 6 3). Mental health issues impact a majority of this population, with 60% of ninth graders who identified as gay, lesbia n, or bi -sexual reporting having long- term mental, behavioral, or emotional health problems. Additionally, 8% of Min nesota ninth graders reported being bullied because they are gay, lesbian, or bisexual or because someone thought they were.74 Higher rates of abuse and harassment at home, at school and in the community contribute to these mental health disparities. One indicator of the increased harassment and rejection LGBTQ youth face is the sizeable percentage (22%) of homeless young adults (age 18 -24) who identify as LGBTQ.75 Physical health is also a concern for LGBTQ youth, with 17% being obese and less than one- third getting the recommended amount of weekly physical activity.76 63.

According to the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey (MSS) , 1.4% of students (in 9th and 11th grade) identified themselves as transgender, gender queer, or genderfluid; an additional 1.6% of ninth graders and 1.2% of eleventh graders were unsure about their gender identity.77 An earlier study using 2016 MSS data found that significantly more transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) students reported \"poor,\" \"fair,\" or \" general health (62%) than their cisgender peers (33%).78 (The response options of poor, fair and good were compared against two other options of \"very good\" and \"excellent.\") In this same study, TGNC students also reported lower rates of preventive health check -ups than cisgender youth, suggesting TGNC youth face barriers to accessing the health care system. For TGNC youth, schools can be places of harassment and victimization. TGNC youth are seven times more likely to report bullying about their gender and f ive times more likely to attempt suicide than their cisgender peers .79 Four in ten transgender or gender diverse (42%) and bisexual (41%) students had experienced sexual harassment in the past 30 days (Figure 64 ). 64.

What are we learning about Minnesota high school students who identify as transgender or gender Diverse Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 70 Communities at highest risk of COVID -19 The COVID -19 pandemic has had large health, economic and social impacts on Minnesota communities in ways that can negatively affect child development, school performance and general well -being.80 Socially vulnerable populations \u2014those that are especially at risk during public health emergencies because of factors like socioeconomic status, household characteristics, racial and ethnic minority status, or housing type and transportation \u2014are at increased risk of COVID -19 cases and mortality.81,82,83 Identifying socially vulnerable populations can lead to interventions to reduce infection rates and the associated impacts of COVID -19 in communities at higher risk, including children and families. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)84 measures neighborhood- level relative social vulnerability using a ranking system from the Census variables on social factors like socioeconomic status, household composition and disability , minority status and language and housing type and transportation. Possible scores range from 0 (lowest vulnerability) to 1 ( highest vulnerability). Figure 65 depicts county -level information regarding neighborhood social vulnerability to better inform Children's Minnesota about regions at higher risk of COVID -19. Counties with higher vulnerability rankings (e.g., Anoka, Dakota, Hennepin and Ramsey) also have higher COVID cases and COVID mortality rates as compared to counties with lower vulnerability rankings (e.g., Carver, Scott and Washington). 80 Nichols, A., Mitchell, J., & Lindner, S.

Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 73 Considerations for interpreting secondary data As stated in the introduction, many data sources were used to write this report. These include: the American Community Survey (ACS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability index, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WISQARS Fatal Injury and Nonfatal Injury, Minnesota Compass, Minnesota Department of Education, Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, Minnesota Department of Health Public Health Data Access Portal, Minnesota Student Survey, Minnesota Geospatial Information Office, Minnesota State Demographic Center, Minnesota WIC Information System, National Survey of Children's Health, IPUMS, University of Minnesota Adolescent Sexual Health Report, the U.S. Census Bureau Dece nnial Census, U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, The United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Services and Wilder Research. Each of these sources has its own set of caveats and limitations; primary limitations to consider include: The majority of data in this report reflect pre -pandemic outcomes and trends. The COVID -19 pandemic, which has had a drastic impact on health outcomes across the globe, occurred after the most recent CHNA was conducted in 2019; however, most of the data reported here reflect a time prior to the pandemic. Children's Minnesota and Wilder staff decided early in the project to examine whatever data were available, in order to meet analysis and reporting timelines. Wilder included more current data where possible, particularly from the Minnesota Department of Health, Minnesota Empl oyment and Economic Development and the Minnesota Department of Education. Some data reflect broader populations than the community definition Children's Minnesota used for this assessment . Data from the seven -county Twin Cities metro area are reported where possible; however, some datasets are not granular enough to report metro- level characteristics or outcomes. In those cases, Wilder opted to present the broader data (e.g., statewide) even though it does not exactly match the scope of Children's Minnesot a's work. Also, this data summary includes data for both children and adult age groups, as adult health outcomes have an impact on the well -being of children and youth. Demographic data, particularly race and ethnicity, are aggregated into groups that do not fully represent the unique identities of Twin Cities' communities. We recognize that there are many different cultural communities that fall within each race/ethnicity category, as well as diversity in experience and perspective within each cultural community. Most secondary data sources report estimates based on responses provided by a sample of community residents. Often, potential disparities are reported using very broad cultural or socioeconomic categories , which does not capture the diversity of opinions and experiences of residents. The data provided in this summary are a starting point to better understand factors that contribute to health and well -being in the Twin Cities metro area. However, there are limitations in the data available. The race and ethnicity categories used in this report are intended to be more detailed and ref lective of the backgrounds of residents who live in the Twin Cities metro area, but are imperfect. Further, reported differences between populations reflect the varied experiences of residents, including the many ways that immigration, housing, education, employment and other policies have impacted specific racial and ethnic groups. The following section highlights some limitations of specific data sources that were used in this re port. American Community Survey data The demographic data presented in this summary are largely from the American Community Survey (ACS). This survey is administered by the U.S. Census Bureau to a sample of residents and weighted in order to calculate estimates for the population. Throughout this summary, the most detailed data available are presented. However, there are l imitations in the degree to which race and ethnicity data can be disaggregated while still providing reliable Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 74 estimates at a more local ( county or neighborhood) level or in counties where relatively few people of the same racial or ethnic community live. Therefore, in some tables, estimates are suppressed because there are not enough residents of a racial or ethnic community to calculate a reliable estimate. Most ACS data reported in this summary cite a date range (e.g., 2015- 19) rather than a single year; the U.S. Census Bureau uses averaged data from a 5 -year period to calculate the most reliable estimates possible. Minnesota Student Surve y data The Minnesota Student Survey (MSS) is cited frequently in this summary, as it includes questions that consider child health and well -being holistically. The MSS is administered every three years to students in selected grades throughout the state; i ndividual survey items and grade levels of students asked to participate have changed over time. This summary includes data from MSS results from 2013, 2016 and 2019 (the most recent survey results available). Some survey instrument questions changed betwe en 2013, 2016 and 2019. While most questions stayed the same, other questions were updated with changes to the question or response options. Results from the ninth grade survey are presented because all MSS items are asked of these young adolescents and the response rate for students at this grade level is higher than for older students. Although these surveys are given repeatedly over time, student populations may change between administrations of the survey. Caution must be used when making comparisons ov er time. Two limitations when interpreting information from this data source include: In 2019, the Minnesota Department of Education provided schools and parents copies of the MSS in Spanish, Somali and Hmong for consent purposes, but the survey was only administered to students in English. Schools and districts with students who were not proficient in English were asked to provide accommodations for students to take the survey. In schools that could not develop translations or provide interpreters, the survey results may not adequately reflect the opinions and experiences of students who receive English Learner (EL) services. In 2019, over 81% of Minnesota's school districts participated. Chanhassen Public Schools (Eastern Carver County Public Schools) dec ided to opt out of the MSS in 2019. Data from this county is included in the summary, but should be interpreted with caution as they exclude the opinions and experiences of large numbers of students. Additionally, only a small sample of Minneapolis Public Schools (a district where nearly two- thirds of students are youth of color) participated. Because these students and potentially some English Learner students were not included, the MSS does not report response rates by race and ethnicity at the county lev el. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 75 Social Vulnerability Index The social vulnerability data in this summary are from the Centers for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The SVI measures neighborhood- level relative social vulnerability using 15 census variables to help local officials identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters. The SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every county or census tract using a ranking system from the 15 variables on social factors like socioeconomic st atus, household composition and disability, minority status and language and housing type and transportation. Possible scores range from 0 (lowest vulnerability) to 1 (highest vulnerability). There are four distinct themes: socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language, housing type and transportation and an overall ranking which combines the four distinct themes. Socioeconomic status includes the percent age below poverty and unemployed, household income and perce ntage with no high school diploma. Household composition & disability includes the percent age age 65+, age 17 or younger, percent age with a disability, percent age of single -parent households. Minority status & l anguage includes the percentage of minority and age 5+ who speak English \"less than well.\" Housing type & transportation includes the percentage of multi -unit structures and mobile homes, crowding, percentage with no vehicle and percentage living in group quarters. Overall tract rankings were calculated by summing the sums for each theme, ordering the counties and then calculat ing overall percentile rankings. Please note; taking the sum of the sums for each theme is the same as summing individual variable rankings. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 76 Primary data collection As part of the 2022 CHNA process, multiple partner groups were asked to consider whether the health topic areas prioritized through the 2019 CHNA continue to be community needs that should be addressed by Children's Minnesota. All groups were invited to identify additional emerging or unmet health needs within the community. The following sections provide a summary of each data collection activity, including focus groups with Children's Minnesota staff, parents and caregivers and youth, as well as individual phone interviews with Children's Minnesota health care providers and staff from com munity -based organizations. A total of 106 people participated in this phase of the work. 35 staff from community -based organizations (33%) 29 staff from Children's Minnesota (27%) 15 parents or caregivers (14%) 15 youth, age 14- 18 (14%) 12 health care pr oviders from Children's Minnesota (11%) Figure 67 illustrates the race and gender identity of participants by group. (Providers were grouped with Children's Minnesota staff and parents, caregivers and youth were grouped together.) 67.

For the interviews, Children's Minnesota staff identified organizat ions that have critical perspectives on children's health and are able to speak to the needs of children from specific geographic and/or cultural communities. Interview respondents represented a range of organizations, including nonprofit and advocacy groups (e.g., autism, education, mental health, queer health, health for people of color ), foundations, school districts, tribes, counties and the state. When asked to describe who their organization serves: Half (N=15) described serving a specific city or co unty and the other half described working across the broader seven- county Twin Cities metro area (N=15) . More than half described serving whole families (N=19), compared to children and youth (birth to young adulthood; N=16). Over one -third (N=11) described their organization as serving communities of color or non- English speaking populations . Six of the organizations talked about serving communities based on health needs, such as mental health challenges and developmental disabilities . Existing health priorities In each interview, Wilder staff described C hildren's Minnesota 's five 2019 health priority areas - mental health and developmental well -being, access to resources, economic opportunity and income, structural racism and health disparities . Respondents were then asked, \"To what extent should each area remain a priority area that Children's Minnesota addresses directly?\" For most areas, respondents felt each area should either be \"essential\" or a \"high\" priority . Mental health and developmental well-being and structural racism were the top priority areas for community -based organization staff (Figure 68). 68.

Bulleted items in each area reflect the main themes identified during the community -based organization interviews. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 78 Mental health and developmental well-being When asked what services have a positive impact on the health of children and families, the most common answer respondents gave was community -based mental health and clinical services. COVI D-19 and other local and global events have deepened and intensified mental health issues across Twin Cities' communities. Respondents talked about families losing the capacity to cope with challenges. There are not enough mental health services (e.g., psychologists, therapists) available f or children and their families; this is especially true for families of color and families who speak languages other than English. There is an urgent need for more culturally responsive services and providers. Specific mental and behavioral health concerns include trauma, anxiety, grief, isolation, depression and suicide. Respondents also talked about \"younger and younger\" children experiencing these mental and behavioral health issues, including suicid e. Respondents talked exclusively about \" mental health\" and particularly the impacts of the past two years on everyone's mental health, rather than talking about \"developmental well -being.\" Structural racism Community -based organizations consistently pointed to structural racism as the way in which policies and practices were designed to intentionally deny certain communities access to opportunities and resources that support advancement and success. Structural racism shapes the environment in which people live and devalues specific communities . As with mental health and developmental well -being, respondents discussed that there are not enough providers of color or bi-lingual providers who represent the communities they serve, which contributes to implicit bias . Political polarization and increases in hate speech were also mentioned by respondents as deeply impacting and further traumatizing communities of color . Health disparities Most respondents rated health disparities as an essential priority; however, they also talked about health disparities as existing because of structural racism; t he two issues are intertwined. Access to resources Many respondents, when describing their image of \"healthy families,\" described having access to basic resources like housing, food, health care services and educational opportunities. Community organizations said that children and families in poverty have the greatest need for services and supports; however, they have the most difficulty accessing these resources . Economic opportunity and income Income and employment were seen as important health issues; however, community organizations most often focused on how the lack of income and employ ment opportunities in their communities contributes to poverty. Some spoke specifically to deep poverty that is present in Indigenous communities and in African American communities that contributes to cycles of intergenerational poverty. Respondents felt that a lack of income and employment exacerbates issues around access to resources such as health care and healthy food. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 79 Emerging health issues identified After community -based organization staff shared their perspectives on the importance of existing heal th priorities, they were asked what health topics or emerging issues they felt Children's Minnesota should be aware of or consider as a priority in 2022 and why. The main topics identified include culturally responsive services and community safety . The following outlines the ways in which community organizations perceived these issues to be present in their community and implications for their existence. Culturally responsive services Many respondents listed cultural resources and supports as havin g a \"positive impact on the health of children and families.\" This included resources for LGBTQ+ community members , Black or African American, Latino and Asian communities as well as other communities of color, Women and immigrant communities . One- third of respondents described the importance of initiatives that are community -led. Intertwined with mental health and developmental well -being (as well as many of the other 2019 health priorities) is the fact that there are not enough culturally responsive servi ces and resources for supporting community health. Respondents pointed to the followi ng as being important components of culturally responsive services and resources: staff who are representative of the community served , overall cultural competency and sensitivity of staff, staff who speak the same languages as the community they serve and ensuring access to services that align with cultural practices. Respondents not ed that the lack of these culturally responsive services and resources are barriers to community health. Community safety Along with mental health, respondents most commonly identified community violence as an area that negatively impacts the health of children and families. Multiple respondents talked about increases in gun violence and the trauma that communities have experienced in the aftermath of increases in gun violence (locally and nationally). Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 80 Ways in Which Children's Minnesota is Best Positioned to Address Health Issues Respondents were asked what they thought Children's Minnesota is best positioned to do to help address the issues affecting the health of children and families in the community in the near future ( i.e., the next three years). Community -based organization respondents identified several approaches. First, more than half of respondents suggested providing or referring to direct resources to increase me ntal health and developmental well - being . Participants suggested that this could be done through collaboration with other organizations and/or by providing culturally appropriate and trauma- informed services at Children's Minnesota. Roughly half of respond ents also suggested that Children's Minnesota could do more to connect families to services and resources more broadly . Finally, more than one -third of participants suggested that Children's Minnesota could increase its direct involvement with community -based organizations in order to tackle future community issues together . The range of respondent suggestions included: Setting both internal/external goals and short/long term goals for communicating and connecting to both families/children and community -based organizations Advocating for systems change, anti -racism and local policies Eliminating barriers to access to services, including barriers around language, cost, insurance and immigration status Providing free mobile clinics Providing education opportunities for families on health and well -being Helping families navigate the healt h care system Supporting multi -system communication in order to provide wider whole family and culturally specific support Partnering and collaborating with community -based organizations Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 81 Children' s Minnesota s taff Earlier this year, Wilder facilitated di scussion groups with staff from Children's Minnesota's Minneapolis and St. Paul campuses. Staff were asked about their perceptions of families' needs related to Children's Minnesota's 2019 priority areas, as well as what other needs are prominent among the children and families they work with. Staff who participated in these discussions included family liaisons, social workers, health care providers, health equity leadership , family resource managers and coordinators, music therapists, psychologists, interpreters, patient experience coaches, human resources staff, child life supervisors and legal services staff . Twenty -nine staff participated in one of two discussions (May 5 and May 6). The majority of the participants identified as White and female and worked at the Minneapolis Children's Minnesota campus. Existing health priorities As with the community -based organization interviews, Wilder asked Children's Minnesota staff, \"To what extent should each area remain a priority area that Children's Minnesota addresses directly?\" Most respondents felt that each area should either be \"essential\" or a \"high\" priority . Structural racism and mental health and developmental well-being were the top priority areas for Children's Minnesota staff ( Figure 69). 69. Children's Minnesota staff ratings of 2019 CHNA priority areas (N=29) Structural racism Mental health/ developmental well-being Health disparities Access to resources Economic opportunity and income Essential 21 20 18 15 5 High 2 4 5 6 12 Moderate 1 0 1 2 6 Somewhat 0 0 0 0 0 Low 0 0 0 1 0 Not a Priority 0 0 1 0 0 Missing 5 5 4 5 6 Structural racism The highest number of staff rated structural racism as an essential priority. Bias and racism can be found throughout the health care system, including providers treating Black or African American, American Indian, Latino or Asian patients differently, as well as not having provider s that represent the patients being served (i.e., racially, ethnically, culturally, linguistically). Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 82 Mental health and developmental well -being Mental health impacts every other area of health. When asked about resources where communities need additional support, the most common response was mental health care - the number of providers, the types of treatment and overall infrastructure. Multiple factors had a negative impact on children and families' health in the past two years, including the pandemic, educational systems (e.g., MPS district redesign, distance learning, overwhelmed teachers), a rise in bullying and hate speech (especially amplified by social media). Health disparities More than other groups, Children's Minnesota staff talked about dispar ities beyond race and ethnicity, especially for LGBTQ+ youth, immigrants and refugees (e.g., several people mentioned the war in Ukraine). Access to resources Having a \"healthy family\" means h aving access to resources, including stable housing, food, trans portation, education and health care (including a good primary care provider) . Our complex and siloed health care system s have a negative impact on families' abilities to access health care. In addition, many families are mistrustful of providers and health care systems because of the complexity. A lack of transportation, unreliable t ransportation and parking fees are also barrier s to accessing services and, ultimately, have a negative impact on health. COVID -19 worsened the ability of families to access health care resources (e.g., baby formula shortage, restrictions on visitors at clinics and hospitals, room shortages, long wait times). Economic opportunity and income Staff discussed the importance of income and employment in meeting basic needs, especially child care and medical costs. Emerging hea lth issues identified Listed below are the emerging health issues and c oncerns identified during the staff discussion groups. Culturally responsive services There are not enough culturally responsive resources at Children's Minnesota. This includes staff representation of different cultures and experiences , as well as gaps in services (e.g., alternative medicine). More culturally responsive health care is needed for transgender p atients, as well as for specific services related to women's health. Some staff also discussed the need for more language interpreters and spiritual services. Safe and supportive environments Several staff talked about the importance of safe and supportive environments, both at home and in the community (e.g., outdoor play spaces, safe schools, clean air/environment). Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 83 Ways in Which Children's Minnesota is Best Positioned to Address Health Issues Children's Minnesota staff participants were asked what Childr en's Minnesota is best positioned to do to address the issues impacting the health of chi ldren and families in the next three years. The most commonly suggested strategy for Children's Minnesota to address issues impacting health was to utilize telehealth and mobile clinics to address lack of access to health care. The second most common strategy participants suggested was increasing partnerships and collaboration with other community organization and schools. Other strategies included: Provide transportat ion assistance (e.g. , parking vouchers, gas assistance) Provide food vouchers for cafeteria Determine whether to pursue a focus on mental health Conduct outreach in diverse communities Provide reconstructive surgery for female genital cutting Provide non-health care resources such as food or clothes Facilitate mandatory staff meetings that promote culturally competent care Focus on diversity, equity and inclusion and hire more staff with similar backgrounds/experiences as patients Participate in political advocacy Make sure hospital administration staff are physically present more often Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 84 Parents and caregivers Children's M innesota staff worked with two community partners ( Ramsey Cou nty Children's Mental Health Collaborative and Ch ildren's Mental Health Collaborative) and the Children's Minnesota Families as Partners program to invite parents and caregivers to participate in two focus groups. Respondents were asked to discuss what health means to them, as well as what factors negati vely and positively impact their community and family's health. Information from parent/caregiver focus groups is used as a supplement to the other primary data collection and secondary data review. Wilder Research moderated the two focus groups - one on August 9th with parents and caregivers recruited by Ramsey and Hennepin County and one on August 3 0th with parents and caregivers recruited through the Families as Partners program . Each participant received a $35 gift card as a thank you for their time. Fifteen parents or caregivers attended the focus groups; the majority were women (80%) and identified as White (33%) or Black (27%; Figure 7 0). The following section outlines the main themes identified during the parent/ caregiver focus groups. 70. Race and gender of parent/caregiver participants (N=15) # % Race White 5 33% Black 4 27% Hispanic 2 13% Asian 1 7% Native American 1 7% Multiracial 1 7% Gender Female 12 80% 0 0% Unknown 0 0% Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 85 Existing health priorities Because of the nature of focus groups, which allow for more open discussion, respondents were not individually asked to rate the 2019 CHNA priority areas (as they were in the community -based organization interviews). That being said, parents and caregivers coalesced around certain priority areas. Access to resources, mental health and developmental well -being and economic opportunity and income were particularly top- of-mind. Access to resources When parents and caregivers were asked to describe what it looks like when their family is \"hea lthy,\" one of the most common themes across groups was having access to recreational activities, especially nature (e.g., parks, lakes, trails), sports, museums and supportive social groups. Parent s also talked about how difficult it is for them to access certain resources (particularly related to mental health). Access to resources includes multiple factors - respondents do not always know where to go for help, eligibility criteria are confusing and resources are limited, especially culturally responsive supports or supports for people who speak languages other than English. Many respondents also discussed the need for additional resources that would support them as caregivers of children, including more maternity and paternity leave, respite care, specific needs support groups (e.g., Down Syndrome or other groups for children with special health needs) and mental health care. Mental health and developmental well -being Parents and caregivers talked about mental health as being part of the \"whole person\" and equally as important as physical health. Many parents and caregivers discussed the mental health resources they r eceive (e.g., through the Ramsey County Children's Mental Health Collaborative) as being the most important. As mentioned among other respondent groups, parents and caregivers talked about the deeply felt need for more mental health services, such as family counseling and counseling for youth in school. Economic opportunity and income When asked which of the 2019 CHNA priority areas pose the biggest challenges for them and their communities , many respondents said \"economic opportunity and income,\" since having income is crucial to supporting other aspects of health. Several families said they struggle to meet basic needs - housing, food and transportation - and that the cost of living is only getting higher. Structural racism and health disparities Parents and caregivers often talked about structural racism and health disparities together. Several parents said that structural racism and health disparities were the biggest challenge for them and their community . A few parents and caregivers talked about experiences at Children's Minnesota (and other health care systems) where providers assumed certain things about their situation based on their race ( parents /caregivers of color ) or gender identity (LGBTQ parents/caregivers) . Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 86 Emerging health issues identified One of the parent/caregiver focus groups spoke about increased violence in the community and the need for more work around community safety. Ways in Which Children's Min nesota is Best Positioned to Address Health Issues Parent and caregiver participants were asked what Children's Minnesota is best positioned to do to address the issues impacting the health of children and families in the next three years. Caregivers suggested that Children's Minnesota could provide more mental health resources and supports, advocate for universal basic income, implement mobile clinics, collaborate with other organizations to provide resources for families (e.g., car seats, books, food), pr ovide financial assistance to patients and give health care professionals time to connect to the community. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 87 Youth, age 14- 18 A select group of youth participated in two focus groups in August 2022. These focus groups were conducted by staff at Youthprise, a Minneapolis -based nonprofit youth development organization. Participants for one focus group were recruited by Children's Minnesota from the membership of its Youth Advisory Council. Participants for the second focus group were recruited by Youthprise from among eligible members of their Youth Engagement Network. All participants lived in the seven- county Twin Cities metro area and were between age 14 and 18.85 Respondents were asked to provide their perspectives on the strengths of their communities, ho w they define health, challenges to having good health and how Children's Minnesota can play a role in improving community health. A total of 15 youth participated in the focus groups. The majority were male (60%) and identified as Black (73%; Figure 71). The following section was produced by Youthp rise and outlines the main themes and relevant quotes shared during the youth focus groups. 71. Demographics of youth participants (N=15) Gender # % Female 6 40% Male 9 60% Race Asian 0 0% Black 11 73% Native American 1 7% White 2 13% Multiracial 1 7% Hispanic 0 0% Unknown 11 0% 85 Because of the age of participants, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained for consent procedures and focus group protocols from the Wilder Research IRB. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, as well as from t he parents/guardians of all participants younger than age 18. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 88 Themes Access to resources, especially financial resources Participants stated people shouldn't be disconnected from basic human needs due to lack of financial resources. Finances are connected to access and overall health. People have to have their needs met before thinking about healthy lifestyles. Participants also shared w hat resources helped them and which they would still like to have. Quotes Access to resources is what I'd rank as number one. With access to the right resources, other problems could be sorted or kept in check. Maybe more places to connect like make a spac e/place that sounds like a lot of fun, that might be nice. A way to be more knowledgeable about what is happening around. I have a friend that goes to an art area with a t -shirt press place and VR space. Having more options of places to go and things to do. My one friend who lives nearby and I would go around our neighborhood on bi ke rides and it got repetitive. I wish public transportation was free, so people can get to where they have to go without having to pay every time. It would be helping the public be more self -sufficient, getting to their jobs, appointments, etc. One place I like to go and it is easier to go now [is] go to my friends' houses and go play basketball, but it's harder to do when you do not drive or have access to transportation. Kind of going off of what [redacted] said \u2014homeless students took a huge hit during COVID and more so than others as they had nowhere to go or have resources they need such as not having a computer or access to distance learning and missed out on a whole year. Financial opportunity and income, I say is the biggest barrier that because it plays into all the other topics. You need funds! There aren 't too many charities for therapy. Like I said before there's intersection because if you have a mental health issue you need to be treated, right? Well, you need a stable financial account to be able to take care of things. We live right by [redacted] near the [uprisings] from George Floyd and we saw people getting pushed out and not get stable housing and not being able to access resources and needs. Like what does it really mean to have safer streets when you move them or shov e them into another corner? That could look like no school, a tent, some cobbled together structure to keep you safe and the health care system is strange and deranged compared to Canada and universal health care. You can get sick but if you can't afford stuff you cannot pay to get b etter or your family might suffer i f you get sick and have to pay. Not having enough money, or financial capability. It [financial opportunity] is the most challenging to me. It can affect everyone in the family from the father to the last child. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 89 Racism and racial disparities Communities of color face disparities when it comes to being healthy, whether it be from lack of resources (health coverage, healthy food, gym memberships, mental health providers), or from facing discrimination in spaces where fitness and health are the center, such as with sports. Quotes I like this topic because I have been experiencing this since elementary school. The racism I have experienced during sports makes it so hard for me to continue the sport. Being on an all -girl Black basketball team and experiencing racism from other players and parents on opposite teams have made it hard. I learned these spaces aren't safe at a really young age. I felt left out and I just had to accept it. It really did affect my mental health but I just learned to deal with it. Discrimination of any kind. Thinking of racism, I am privileged enough to have a house and it's just really sad and I wish people could all be equal and have what they need that they do not get. Women's Rights and Black Rights . I don't know, I feel like we are going backwards.\" I want to jump off what [redacted] said. I completely agree. The whole Roe v. Wade thing really sets the tone for how the government and higher ups see not even just Black women, but any woman of color. Any woman with the slightest pigment. It's really actually sad. I feel Black women are especially dismissed when it comes to medical things or when then go to the hospital. It's either a one and done, or a 'you don't have that.' 'You'll be fine.' Or a 'al l you need to do is this.' When there's been stories and lots of cases where Black women was like, 'This is what the doctor told me, I did it and it 'f -----' me up even worse. Excuse my language. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 90 COVID -19 and its impacts The pandemic, lockdown and COVID -19 itself had a number of impacts on the community and how health was experienced and defined. Quotes I feel with COVID and health issues it has created mental health issues. I went in to get a primary doctor and she bombarded me with mental health and how me losing weight was tied to my mental health. It's weird. Before they would say I needed to gain weight. Obviously COVID even though it's a generic answer. Obviously, it wasn't great - always staring at a computer, not having interactions and as a famil y not connected and going out. . Of course, COVID. We used to have block party things and then they stopped having them but we were not connected. We were all isolated during COVID and it was exhausting, the pressure of having to be online and not feel ing fulfilled . Kind of going off of what [redacted] said - homeless [students] took a huge hit during COVID and more so than others as they had nowhere to go or have resources they need such as not having a computer or access to distance learning and missed out on a whole year. Mental Health Mental health can be a barrier to youth and families ' health and wellness. and it impacts nearly everything. Participants found it to be a challenge to focus on other areas of life when their mental health was not up t o par. They also noted how mental health has shifted during the pandemic both for themselves and the community. Quotes I feel like mental health can consume all. Meaning your physical health, your emotional health, everything. I know this from personal exp erience...I feel you can't be healthy in life in all aspects if you aren't working on your mental health. I suggest that above all. I feel with COVID and health issues it has created mental health issues. I went in to get a primary doctor and she bombarded me with mental health and how me losing weight was tied to my mental health. It's weird. Before they w ould say I need to gain weight. It's about the people around us. If you get positive vibes, you will give positive vibes. If you give negative vibes, yo u will give out negative vibes. Mental health is part of the conducts that directs even physical activities that helps you live healthily. Having a lot of different places you [could] run into people and are connected to friends. It makes me happy and improves my mental health to be more connected to people si nce my friends are not nearby. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 91 Children' s Minnesota provider s A select group of Children's Minnesota health care pr oviders were interviewed in summer 2022. Providers included physicians, social workers, psychologists and nurse practitioners who worked in multiple Children's Minnesota locations (Minneapolis and St. Paul) and settings ( emergency departments, inpatient setting, primary care and specialty clinic care). Respondents were asked to provide their perspectives on the importance of continuing 2019 community health priorities, perceptions of emerging health issues and barriers families experience to health and wellness. A total of 12 providers were interviewed. The majority were women (83%) and identified as White (67%) or Hispanic (17%). Most (70%) were physicians and the greatest percent age (33%) practiced in inpatient hospital setting s, with the majority of practice settings located in Minneapolis (58%; Figure 7 2). The following section outlines the main themes identified during the provider interviews . 72. Demographics and characteristi cs of practice for provider participants (N=12) Gender (N=12) # % Female 10 83% Male 1 8% Gender non -binary 1 8% Race and ethnicity (N=12) Asian 1 8% Hispanic 2 17% White 8 67% Multiracial 1 8% Role (N=10) Nurse Practitioner 1 10% Physician 7 70% Psychologist 1 10% Social Worker 1 10% Primary practice setting (N=12) Emergency department 2 17% Inpatient hospital 4 33% Primary care 2 17% Specialty clinic care 3 25% Other 1 8% Location of primary practice setting (N=12) Minneapolis 7 58% St. Paul (proper, not including West St. Paul) 2 17% Multiple locations 3 25% Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 92 Existing health priorities As with the community -based organization interviews and staff discussions , Wilder asked Children's Minnesota providers , \"To what extent should each area remain a priority area that Children's Minnesota addresses directly?\" Again, most respondents felt that each area should either be \"essential\" or a \"high\" priority . Mental health and developmental well -being, health disparities and access to resources were the top priority areas for Children's Minnesota providers (Figure 73). 73.

Stressors in the community and within families have manifested as problems for children [in] their mental and behavioral health,\" noted one participant. A theme that emerged was the extent to which mental health struggles among children are both more widespread and more severe than before. \"Everybody is struggling. There are not enough resources. Suicidality has increased ... [and] I see [this] at Children' s,\" noted one provider. Another participant commented, \"The thing that seems categorically worse is the volum e of actively suicidal children who have overdosed, we're stabilizing, or they've done self-harm. We are seeing higher numbers of more aggressive self -injury. This is getting worse.\" Providers noted that mental health concerns among children have been exacerbated by recent local and global events. \"[These events are] negatively impacting k ids. Maybe it's just the pandemic , but it feel s worse than it did 10 years ago as a pediatrician. I think Children's is making good decisions, but [I'm] more discouraged than I was pre- pandemic. Delayed social skills for the littles, learning loss for older kids, everyone so stressed. The mental health tie -in. The stressors are overwhelming compared to the coping mechanisms.\" Another participant noted, \"Children are fearful and anxious about all of these issues. Their fear manifests itself as emotional and behavioral health complications.\" Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 93 Health disparities Provider respondents discussed health disparities primarily by race/ethnicity and income. One pointed out the extent to which the COVID -19 pandemic underscored health disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) . Providers emphasized that health disparities by race/ethnicity are caused b y systemic racism: \"Racism in general is having a huge impact on patients and families. Racist structures and societal pressures [are] the largest driver[s] of adverse health outcomes and disparities. The largest groups of patients Children's is currently not adequately serving is based on racial identity. That is the biggest gap.\" Access to resources Providers primarily framed access to resources in the context of health care resources, commonly reporting challenges among Children's Minnesota families in accessing needed heath care services due to the complexity of the hea lth care system . Providers observed that the health care system can be especially difficult for families to access and under stand if households are low income, low literacy, and/or don't speak English . Provider participants also noted that clinical providers have reduced capacity to help patients with navigating the health system and this reduction exacerbates the challenges of accessing needed services: Providers noted a number of practical barriers to accessing health care as well, including long wait times for care, lack of transportation, insufficient access to interpreters, insufficient access to health insurance and prescription drug coverage, the cost of care, lack of form literacy and lack of flexible care times. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 94 Structural racism Providers identified racism firmly as being an ongoing priority area because it drives negative health outcomes and disparities. Providers underscored insufficient representation of people of color among providers and staff at Children's Minnesota, pointi ng out that representation matters for families and patients . Providers pointed out the disproportionate impact of recent local and global events on people of color. One respondent noted, \"The murder of George Floyd, social injustice, abortion rights, anti -trans legislation ... COVID, have all adversely affected [multiple] populations at much higher rates, with worsening disparities.\" Providers noted that racism adds another level of difficulty when patients and families are trying t o navigate a health system that is already complex . Economic opportunity and income Providers noted the critical role economic opportunity and income play in determining health. A provider pointed out the extent to which lack of ec onomic resources shows up in the social determinants of health: \"housing instability, transportation difficulties, food insecurity, un reliable electricity, [unstable] access to health insurance.\" Heath care costs arose as an issue that affects most families, even if their income is steadier: \" [F]amilies that have more stable incomes worry about medical bills. Finances end up driving a lot of the care decisions.\" Emerging health issues identified Multiple respondents identified mental health and devel opmental wellbeing as an emerging priority. While mental health and well -being are a priority at Children's Minnesota, respondents are concerned about the increase in mental health issues, specifically as it related to the pandemic and racial injustice, al though one provider explained that it is difficult to \"tease out\" the impact of the pandemic on mental health. Some providers identified mental health and developmental well -being, in general, as an emerging area of concern, while others pointed out more s pecific issues like the rise in transphobia and homophobia along with concerns about gender health. The need for chemical dependency support for caregivers arose as a concern , as did the issue of stress related to financial insecurity and the problem of having low emotional reserves to handle everyday stressors. Related to health care, providers cited problems with continuity of care, access to services and provide r burnout. Ways in Which Children's Minnesota is Best Positioned to Address Health Issues Respondents were asked what they thought Children's Minnesota is best positioned to do to help address the issues affecting the health of children and families in the community in the near future (i.e., the next three years). Providers most often said that Children's Minnesota is best positioned to address these issues by developing more partnerships with community resources. Respondents suggested, variously, that Chi ldren's Minnesota should expand its Community Connect services to all Children's Minnesota locations, promote the work of community -based organizations, expand its cultural and language liaisons to all Children's Minnesota locations and establish a time where community organizations that are helping families all come to a Children's Minnesota location together to make it easier for families to acc ess services. Children's Minnesota | 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 95 Providers also frequently stated that Children's Minnesota is best positioned to address gaps in mental health care services. They suggested that Children's Minnesota could do this by, for example, incorporating chemical dependency treatment for families, increasing available crisis psychiatry services, ensuring there is outpatient follow -up after inpatient services and advocating at the state level for resource allocation for mental health management through coalition efforts. Respondents suggested a number of other ways that Children's Minnesota could help address the issues affecting the health of children and families in the near future, although these suggestions didn't fall into cohesive categories. Respondents suggested that Children's Minnesota could: institute universal screening for social determinants of health, focus on h olistic care, reduce health disparities, implement mobile clinics, provide more care coordination, address systemic racism in a systematic way, provide health and health care education, provide housing support, hire more language ambassadors (or patient family health advocates for language barriers), continue advocating for Medicaid expansion and advocate against gun violence and anti -trans legislation.
