Also, to develop and validate a personalized clinical trial educational platform to boost participation among underserved cancer patients. - [Collecting Blood Samples From Patients With and Without Cancer to Evaluate Tests for Early Cancer Detection](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20541353) Albert Lea, MN; Eau Claire, WI; La Crosse, WI; Mankato, MN The purpose of this study is to collect blood and tissue samples from patients with and without cancer to evaluate laboratory tests for early cancer detection which may help researchers develop tests for the early detection of cancers. - [\"Prescribing\" Exercise to Cancer Patients at High-Risk for Falls](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20474788) Rochester, MN Falls are common and catastrophic in cancer patients. Cancer patients are vulnerable to falls due to muscle loss. In prescribing exercise in a data driven manner to cancer patients, our hypothesis is this \"prescription\" for exercise will eventually be demonstrated to reduce the occurrence of injurious falls. - [The Circulating circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) to develop assays to detect cancer early in blood. The purpose of this study is to collect biological samples from donors with a new diagnosis of cancer (blood and tumor tissue) and from donors who do not have a diagnosis of cancer (blood) in order to characterize the population heterogeneity in cancer and non-cancer subjects and to develop models for distinguishing "}
