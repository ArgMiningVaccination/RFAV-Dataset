Seventy-three per cent of the College's staff had their research judged as world-leading or inter - nationally excellent (4* and 3*), the highest percentage of all UK multi- faculty universities. The College also has six of the UK's top-rated research areas (4*): Chemical Engineering; Civil Engineering; Epidemiology; Mechanical, Aeronautical and Manufacturing Engineering; History; and Pure Mathematics. Professor Jeff Magee, Deputy Principal of Research for the Faculty of Engineering, said: \"I am pleased that the RAE rating for departments within the Faculty of Engineering has recognised our leadership in research. This has been achieved without compromising our com- mitment to excellence in teaching, or sacrificing our engagement with the wider academic and industrial community.\" Professor Maggie Dallman, Principal of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, said: \"It's fantastic to see that researchers from right across the Faculty\u2014from evolutionary biology , through maths and chemistry, to astrophysics\u2014have performed so well in all the core disciplines that not only contribute to our fundamental knowledge base, but also underpin our applied and translational work.\" Professor Stephen Smith, Principal of the Faculty of Medicine, said: \"I am very pleased to see 71 per cent of our medical research being rated as world-leading or internationally excellent. This is particularly impressive when you consider that we submitted over 90 per cent of our research staff. I would like to offer my congratula- tions and my thanks to the Faculty's staff for all their hard work.\" Professor David Begg, Principal of the Business School, said: \"The Business School is thrilled to have come second nationally in the RAE, ahead of both Cambridge and Oxford, and to be within the top handful of units of assess- ment within Imperial. Having recently been included explicitly in Imperial's mission statement, we are delighted to have it confirmed inde-pendently that our research is fully up to the Imperial standard.\" \u2014Abigail Smith, Communications For more information visit: www3.imperial.ac.uk/raenews update This month we are celebrating the 200th edition of Reporter.

Each studentship offers a grant to cover tuition fees, plus \u00a318,000 to cover living expenses over the 12-month course and a six-month internship in a broad-cast organisation on completion of the course. The scheme is funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of its public engagement programme. Dr Stephen Webster, acting director of the Science Communication Group, says: \"These new studentships will make it possible for trained scientists to truly become broad-cast professionals. Good science communication requires expertise both in science and in media skills. You just have to look at that 2007 documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle, which denied anthropogenic climate change. What a distortion of science and scientists!\" The MSc programme is focused on audio-visual production and students have the opportunity to research, script, shoot and edit their own programme based on their ideas for a television or radio documentary. Applicants should have a PhD, or already be practising scientists. The deadline for applications is 27 February 2009. \u2014Naomi Weston, Communications For more information please visit: www.imperial.ac.uk/humanities/sciencecommunicationgroup/masters/funding> This chart shows how Imperial compares to the top UK institutions: 2 www.imperial.ac.uk/reporter reporter 22 January 2009 Issue 200 Editor Emily Ross reporter@imperial.ac.ukeditorialBuilding confidence among female academic staff is one of the aims of the Springboard women's development course, which twenty postdoc- toral women celebrated completing in December, at an event hosted by the Rector. Springboard was introduced to the College in September 2008. It seeks to help female staff in the competitive academic environment, where they are still outnumbered by men. The Springboard course involved a full day of activities each month and combined both discussion and interactive activities such as role playing to practise assertiveness skills. Participants received guidance and support to assist them in identifying goals and strengths and dealing with stress and pressure. The course also provided networking opportunities aimed at helping participants to overcome the isolation that many women researchers report experiencing. Dr Liz Elvidge, Development Manager at the College, set up the programme. She said: \"Springboard enables women from different disciplines but at the same career stage to discuss issues confidentially and in a supportive environment.\" \u2014Naomi Weston, Communications Visit: www.imperial.ac.uk/staffdevelopment/postdocs Imperial staff scoop two OBEs In the New Year's Honours, Professor Deborah Ashby (Epidemiology, Public Health and Primary Care), Chair in Medical Statistics and Clinical Trials, received an OBE for services to medicine. She said: \"To work in an area that is intellectually stimulating and makes a difference to people's lives is a privilege; to have this recognised and honoured is the icing on the cake.\" Robin Pitman, a consultant in the Institute for Security Science and Technology who joined the College this year, was also honoured with an OBE for his work with the Ministry of Defence. Faculty of Medicine appointments Spin-out sale Imperial Innovations concluded the sale of spin-out company Thiakis to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for up to \u00a3100 million in December.

His research focuses on increasing understanding of the genetic causes of asthma and eczema. 22 January 2009 Issue 200 reporter www.imperial.ac.uk/reporter 3 Addiction, anxiety and Alzheimer's tackled by new Chair Professor David Nutt (Neuroscience and Mental Health), a leading researcher who looks at how the brain behaves in people with health problems such as addiction, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease, has been announced as the new Edmond J. Safra Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology. Neuropsychopharmacology is the study of pharmaceuticals or pharmacology as applied to neurological and psychiatric disease. Professor Nutt is an expert in how the circuits in the brain work together and has made key discoveries about the role of neurotransmitters in anxiety, depression, addiction and sleep that have improved the treatment of patients with these disorders. In his new role he will be using cutting edge scanning techniques to develop new treatments for a range of conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and depression. The Edmond J. Safra Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology is a new position at Imperial, established with a donation from the Edmond J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation and Mrs Lily Safra. \u2014Lucy Goodchild, Communications New centre for synthetic biology Programming biological cells so that they behave like engineering parts is the focus of research at a new UK centre announced last December, supplied by an \u00a38 million grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The new centre will focus on synthetic biology, a field in which engineers work with molecular bioscientists to produce biologically based parts by modifying DNA. These parts could be used to build biological devices that could detect the early onset of disease or combat harmful bacterial infections. Imperial, in partnership with LSE, will establish the Centre for Synthetic Biology and Innovation as part of the EPSRC's effort to push the UK to the forefront of this field. Imperial's Professor Richard Kitney, Director of the Centre, says that this new research facility will bring a wealth of new expertise to the UK. He adds: \"Imperial will recruit the best scientists from the UK and around the world to carry out collaborative research, generate intellectual property for licensing, and ultimately create spinout companies that will play a part in spawning new industries for the UK.\" Imperial's Professor Paul Freemont, who is Co-Director of the Centre, says: \"Our understanding of how living cells work isn't as good as our understanding of electronic devices. We want to get to the stage where we've got all the parts we need to build any biological machine that we want.\" \u2014Colin Smith, Communications For more information visit: www3.imperial.ac.uk/news/syntheticEdgerton to present Royal Society lecture Professor David Edgerton, Hans Rausing Professor in Imperial's Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine, has been invited by the Royal Society to give the Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Prize Lecture for 2009.

The new development, to be completed as early as December this year, will consolidate cardiac surgery provided at Hammersmith and St Mary's hospitals into refurbished facilities at Hammersmith, and will mean more than 1,000 cases can be treated per year. Existing wards will be refurbished to create a dedicated cardiac surgery ward, a cardiac intensive care unit, including five new single rooms, and a dedicated cardiology and cardiothoracic step-down ward. To improve the patient experience, all ward spaces will be renovated with better shower and toilet facilities and a greater emphasis on privacy and dignity. Lara Waywell, Head of Operations for Circulation Sciences and Renal Medicine, said: \"The new site is an exciting development for both patients and staff. Environmental upgrades and better facilities will mean an improvement in service delivery and greater employment opportunities for staff, such as developing new roles within nursing.\" Jon Anderson, Cardiothoracic Surgeon and Chief of Service, continued: \"By concentrating clinical expertise on one site and pooling resources, we will hopefully reduce waiting times, especially for tertiary referrals, and provide a more streamlined service to patients in north west London, which has a high-risk catchment population for coronary heart disease.\" \u2014Cassie Zachariou, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Press OfficeNEWS \" Environmental upgrades and better facilities will mean an improvement in service delivery\" 22 January 2009 Issue 200 reporter www.imperial.ac.uk/reporter 5 news updateTiny crystals found inside bacteria provide a magnetic compass to help them navigate through sediment to find the best food, according to research published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface on 17 December. The authors say their research could provide fresh clues to explain biomagnetism, a phenomenon by which some birds, insects and marine life navigate using the magnetic field that encompasses the Earth. The study focuses on magnetotactic bacteria, which contain chains of magnetic crystals, called magnetosomes. They exist all over the globe, living in lake and pond sedi-ments and in ocean coastal regions. Since the discovery of magnetotactic bacteria in the 1970s, it has not been clear exactly what magnetosomes were for. Previous research suggested that some magneto-some chains would not be useful for navigation because their crystal sizes did not possess the right magnetic qualities. However, researchers at Imperial and the University of Edinburgh have now shown that previous modelling methods were inaccurate. New calculations prove that all known magnetosomes do possess the right magnetic qualities for navigation. Study leader Dr Adrian Muxworthy (Earth Science and Engineering) explained: \"Magnetosomes align with one another to form a chain inside the bacteria and work like a magnetic compass. We are still not sure how, but this compass interacts with the Earth's magnetic field, helping the bacteria to navigate through sediment to the best feeding grounds.\" \u2014Colin Smith, CommunicationsTiny magnetic crystals act as compass Genetic variations that can predispose children to Kawasaki disease are highlighted in a new study published on 9 January in PLoS Genetics. The disease, the cause of which is currently unknown, is a rare and severe childhood disorder that occurs mainly in young children. It is the most common cause of childhood acquired heart disease in developed countries, particularly among Japanese children and those of Asian descent. The new study identifies variations in 31 genes which appear to increase a child's risk of developing Kawasaki disease. The findings will enable scientists to develop more effective ways of tackling the disease by revealing new targets for treatment. Professor Michael Levin (Medicine), one of the study's authors, said: \"Sadly, all the hospitals in the UK frequently see children with Kawasaki disease. A child whose coronary arteries are damaged in early childhood faces a lifetime of uncertainty and risk, and we des- perately need better treatments to prevent long term heart problems in those affected. We hope our new study will help us to reach this goal.\" Researchers from Imperial and other international institutions per - formed a genome-wide association study in 119 Caucasian cases and 135 matched controls from Australia, Holland, USA and the UK. They looked at 250,000 genetic variants in each patient and uncovered the most significant genes that appeared to be involved in Kawasaki disease. The researchers are now planning to analyse an Asian cohort of people with the disease to see if their results can be replicated. \u2014Lucy Goodchild, Communications Shedding light on serious childhood diseaseDiabetes and high levels of blood sugar may be linked to abnormalities in a person's body clock and sleep patterns, according to a genome-wide associ- ation study by Imperial and other international institutions. The research, published in Nature Genetics on 7 December, suggests that diabetes and higher than normal blood sugar levels could partly be tackled by treating sleep problems. People with high blood sugar levels and diabetes have an increased risk of developing a range of conditions, including cardiovas- cular diseases. The new study shows that a mutation called rs1387153, near a gene called MTNR1B, is associated with an increased average blood sugar level and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. MTNR1B forms part of a signalling pathway control-ling the action of the hormone melatonin, which regulates the body's circadian rhythm, or internal clock, in response to daylight and darkness. The discovery of the rs1387153 mutation provides evidence that high blood sugar and diabetes could be directly linked to an impaired circadian rhythm. Professor Philippe Froguel (Medicine), corresponding author of the research, said: \"There is already some research to suggest links between sleep problems and conditions such as obesity and depression, both of which are associated with diabetes... Our new study demonstrates that abnor - malities in the circadian rhythm may partly be causing diabetes and high blood sugar levels. We hope it will ultimately provide new options for treating people.\" The new study is part of a series of discoveries about the genetics of diabetes by Professor Froguel and his colleagues. \u2014Laura Gallagher, Communications Body clock linked to diabetes and high blood sugar \" abnormalities in the circadian rhythm may partly be causing diabetes and high blood sugar levels\" \" We are still not sure how, but this compass interacts with the Earth's magnetic field\" 6 www.imperial.ac.uk/reporter 2009 Issue 200scienceroundup scienceroundup scienceroundup scienceroundup scienceroundupResearchers from Imperial are developing a system to monitor Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and detect signal problems. GNSS are a network of satellites orbiting the Earth that transmit precise microwave signals to antennae on the ground. These signals are transmitted to GNSS receivers enabling location, time and speed measurements to be taken. Many users, including motor - ists, pilots and emergency services, rely on the accuracy of informa-tion from their GNSS receivers. However, transmitting signals can be affected by a number of subtle failures such as satellite transmis-sion problems, atmospheric inter - ference, or illegal jamming. Currently, there are no effective methods for detecting whether signal quality has been compromised. Professor Washington Ochieng (Civil and Environmental Engineering) says that this has the potential to cause problems: \"We've all heard the funny stories about drivers being led up the proverbial garden path because of problems with GPS devices. However, impacts to signal quality can have serious consequences to shipping, trans- port and emergency services.\" Professor Ochieng and his team are working with a number of partners including the University of Bath and BT Design, on a new system named GAARDIAN (GNSS Availability, Accuracy, Reliability and Integrity Assessment for Timing and Navigation) to improve monitoring of signal transmis-sions. As part of the \u00a32.2 million research project, portable probes will be developed to continu-ously transmit information to a computer server and detect whether signal quality is deterio-rating, interrupted, or jammed. The team plan to develop a fully operating prototype of their system for commercialisation. \u2014Colin Smith, CommunicationsImperial researchers have tricked bone marrow into releasing extra adult stem cells into the bloodstream, a technique that they hope could one day be used to repair heart damage or mend a broken bone. When a person has a disease or an injury, the bone marrow mobilises different types of stem cells to help repair and regenerate tissue. The new research, published on 7 January in the journal Cell Stem Cell, shows that it may be possible to boost the body's ability to repair itself and speed up repair by using dif- ferent new drug combinations to put the bone marrow into a state of 'red alert' and send specific kinds of stem cells into action. In the new study, researchers tricked the bone marrow of healthy mice into releasing two types of adult stem cells\u2014mesenchymal stem cells, which can turn into bone and cartilage and can also suppress the immune system, and endothelial progenitor cells, which can make blood vessels and therefore have the potential to repair damage in the heart. Dr Sara Rankin, the study's corresponding author from the National Heart and Lung Institute, said: \"We hope that by releasing extra stem cells...we could potentially call up extra numbers of whichever stem cells the body needs, in order to boost its ability to mend itself and accelerate the repair process. Further down the line, our work could lead to new treatments to fight various diseases and injuries which work by mobilising a person's own stem cells from within.\" \u2014Laura Gallagher, CommunicationsStem cells called up to repair the bodyPicking up signals from global satellites New species of flowering plants called proteas are appearing in parts of Australia and South Africa faster than anywhere else in the world, according to research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on 22 December. Proteas are best known as the national symbol of South Africa. The inter - national team behind the new study created an evolutionary 'family tree' of all 2,000 protea plant species on Earth\u2014the majority of which are found in South Western Australia and the Cape floristic region of South Africa. The research provides the first conclusive proof that plant species are evolving approximately three times faster in these 'biodiversity hotspots'. The study dates this surge in protea specia- tion as occurring in the last 10-20 million years, following a period of climate change during which South Western Australia and the Cape Floristic Region became hotter, drier, and more prone to vegetation fires.Dr Vincent Savolainen (Natural Sciences), one of the study's authors, who is based at Imperial and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, commented: \"Something special is happening in these regions: new species of proteas are appearing notably faster than else-where, and we suspect this could be the same case with other plant species too. This study proves that the abundance of different kinds of proteas in these two areas isn't simply due to normal rates of species diversification occurring over a long period of time.\" \u2014Danielle Reeves, Communications\" Something special is happening in these regions: new species of proteas are appearing notably faster than elsewhere\"\" we could potentially call up extra numbers of whichever stem cells the body needs, in order to boost its ability to mend itself\" Protea plants unlock secrets of species 'hotspots' 22 January 2009 Issue 200 reporter www.imperial.ac.uk/reporter 7 scienceroundup scienceroundup scienceroundup scienceroundup scienceroundupEmily Ross meets with some of the Grantham Institute's latest recruits to find out how they are contributing to the future of our world. Despite the tumbling stock markets and the threat of melting ice caps Professor Sir Brian Hoskins, Director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, has an opti-mistic outlook for 2009. He says: \"The credit crunch is a fantastic opportunity for the UK to reassess what we are doing. I hope the short-term measure of encouraging people to spend money in the shops is replaced by more strategic thinking\u2014how will the UK contribute towards the world? What makes sense for our future?\" With the global economic crisis, the UK's traditional role as a financial leader is in jeopardy, but Professor Hoskins reasons: \"If we chose to invest our money in all the clean technologies out there and new ways of doing things, we could become leaders in this field. The two problems needn't be considered separately.\" Professor Hoskins admits that visions of climate change portrayed in the media can often seem so dire that they actually encourage apathy. He says: \"It is not hopeless but it gets increasingly difficult each year that goes by without doing anything.\" And tackling climate change head-on is one of the reasons why the Grantham Institute for Climate Change was set up in February 2007. He says: \"I hope the exist-ence of the Grantham Institute can help the world appreciate the climate change problem and also provide a sense of hope that we can do something about it. Our aim is to try to anticipate what the world is going to be like in 2050 and address the potential problems.\" Driving Professor Hoskins' vision for the future are the researchers working for the Institute. The Grantham management team are keen to get researchers from across the College who are working on climate change research involved in the Institute, and over the last year there has also been a big external recruitment drive with more researchers set to begin this year. Professor Hoskins has employed people from all sectors to work directly for the Institute, looking at a range of climate change areas including global health, solar power and the economy. The economics of climate change Although on the surface the economy may not have an obvious link to climate change research, Professor Hoskins explains why it is an integral factor: \"Economics can help us predict the real implications of bringing in renewable energy, it tells us how much new technologies will cost, what policy might be needed and allows us to gauge just how possible our plans are. Having a strong economic basis is essential to help us show the world that our plans are grounded in reality.\" In October 2008 two economists, Dr Mirabelle Mu\u00fbls and Dr Julien Chevallier, joined the Grantham Institute to look at different aspects of the economy. Dr Mu\u00fbls specialises in environmental and international economics and is particu - larly interested in the transfer of clean technologies to developing countries. Her key research project seeks to understand why firms within a sector, producing the same type of products, show a great vari-ation in their energy efficiency. She says: \"This is crucial in order to tackle climate change, given that firms are responsible for a large share of emis-sions. There are huge potential savings in CO 2 emissions that could be realised by improving firm-level performance.\" Dr Mu\u00fbls has never worked in a pure science environment before, she says: \"It's great because it means I will be able to develop policy which is consistent with what science tells us about climate change.\" Dr Mu\u00fbls explains that it was Professor Henry Tulkens, from the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain who first sparked her interest in climate change: \"He told me how important understanding the eco-nomics behind climate change was in order to solve the problem in the most efficient way and to create the right incentives for people, firms and governments to change their attitudes.\"\" Economics can help us predict the real implications of bringing in renewable energy\"Designing a brighter future 8 www.imperial.ac.uk/reporter reporter 22 January 2009 Issue 200 30 20 10 0 Jul 05 Sep 05 Nov 05 Jan 06 Jul Sep 06 Nov 06 Jan 07 Mar 07 Cost/\u20ac Carbon spot and futures price development from July 1, 2005 to April 30, 2007. Source: Bluenext and ECX.Carbon trading Another environ- mental economist working for the Grantham Institute, Dr Chevallier, specialises in carbon finance and emissions trading. Emissions trading is a term which relates to the Kyoto Protocol (the United Nations' environmental treaty adopted in 1992) which prescribed a five per cent reduction target in greenhouse gases for 182 countries. Professor Hoskins is also closely involved in the topic of carbon emis-sions, as he sits on the Committee on Climate Change, an influential body established as part of the Government's Climate Change Bill. Asserting the continuing importance of climate change in the heart of the stock market slump last October, the Committee set new targets to reduce the UK's CO 2 emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. Dr Chevallier explains that in order to control carbon emissions the EU developed a system of carbon trading permits, allowing companies to trade their allowances with each other\u2014creating a new trading market related to emis- sions. However, between 2006 and 2007 the spot carbon price (the price at the point of trading) collapsed, as he explains: \"Unfortunately, the carbon price which was as high as \u20ac30 per ton of CO 2 emitted in April 2006 plummeted to zero in December 2007.\" Looking at the carbon trading market, and finding out how to amend the system and what factors affected its demise, is Dr Chevallier's key focus. He is also interested in what the EU can learn from this early experience. He says: \"At the European level, during 2005-06, the most conserva-tive estimates state that the emission of 54 million tonnes of CO 2 was avoided. We can't ignore these figures. As well as finding out what we did wrong, we also need to learn what we did right.\" Dr Chevallier explains what drew him to his role at the Institute: \"Carbon finance is a small but growing academic field. I have come here to develop my expertise and to make a seminal contribution to asset pricing of the CO2 market. I'm really excited as at the Grantham Institute and with senior researchers within the Business School there is the opportunity to assess quantitatively the development of the European carbon market.\" Infectious disease modelling The effect of climate change on human health is another important area for the Institute, and Dr Paul Parham has been brought in to develop mathematical models which can predict the future impact of infectious diseases such as malaria. Dr Parham studied for his MSci in the Department of Physics before moving to the Division of Epidemiology, Public Health and Primary Care to conduct a PhD developing theoretical tools to model and analyse infectious disease outbreaks such as foot-and-mouth disease. He explains that mathematical models are useful retrospectively, in real-time and to help predict risks before they happen. \"What you don't want to be doing is working to develop a model from scratch when there has been a rapid outbreak and you are massively under pressure. At that stage, you want to be able to feed data into a reliable and mean-ingful model and quickly evaluate a range of possible control options.\" One of the variables Dr Parham is looking at in his current research is temperature and its effects on the spread of disease. He says: \"Our current climate models predict that, on average, temperatures may go up by around two to four degrees Celsius by 2100. Diseases like malaria may be more likely to occur as temperatures rise up to a certain limit, as mosquitoes\u2014which carry the disease\u2014process blood meals faster and survive longer. However, if the temperature rises too much this causes mosquitoes to die, which causes malaria incidence to drop. What I'm developing is a set of models which take temperature and other environmental factors into account and look at the global burden of disease in the future, month by month and area by area.\" Professor Hoskins explains how valuable these models will be for developing health policy. He says: \"There are ambitious plans to try and eradicate malaria in the future. The plan is that Paul's mathematical models will provide policy makers with an idea of how future tempera- tures and weather patterns impact on the spread of disease, which can be used alongside existing medical knowledge of the disease. It would Changes in the probability of malaria becoming endemic as a result of climate change in Tanzania from 2006 (left) to 2050 (right). The progression from green to red represents increasing risk of endemic malaria. continued on page 11What do you do at Imperial? \"I am a lecturer in isotope geochemistry. I analyse the chemical content of materials such as water, corals and sediment. They tell us a lot about the Earth's climate system in the past. Understanding the past is important for predicting future effects of climate change.\" What inspired you to become a scientist? \"I had a great geography primary school teacher. He really got us interested in how the Earth works.\" What are you currently working on? \"I am hoping to solve the mystery of the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains in Antarctica by studying the chemical composition of materials derived from this area. These mountains are the size of the European Alps buried under kilometres of ice. Nobody knows how they got there.\" What are the implications for the world if you solve this mystery? \"Most people think that Antarctic glaciation started in the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains some 40 million years ago. Besides resolving the puzzle of how the mountains got there, my research may find that they have played an important role in helping Antarctica make its transition from a warm greenhouse climate to its present frigid icehouse condition.\" What do you enjoy most about working in Earth Science and Engineering? \"You can use your imagination and it allows you to be curious. Also, in my line of work when you are trying to understand the Earth you begin to realise how small we really are compared with the Earth's global cycles. \u2014Colin Smith, CommunicationsDr Tina van de Flierdt mini profile Dr Tina van de Flierdt (Earth Science and Engineering) is hoping to discover the origins of an ancient mountain range buried under thousands of metres of Antarctic ice. science for beginners > S tem cells and SCIENC E > for beginners SCIENC E > for beginners SCIENC E > for beginners scienc e > for beginners science for beginners > stem cells >science for beginners >science for beginnersscienc e > for beginners scienc e > made easy scienc e > for beginners scienc e scienc e > >for beginnersGreenhouse gases \"In 1824 Joseph Fourier, a French mathematician, first described the greenhouse effect, comparing the effect of the Earth's atmosphere to that of glass covering a bowl. Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish physicist and physical chemist, later (1896) linked temperature changes on Earth to concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases; others include methane, nitrous oxides, ozone and water vapour. The Earth receives radiation from the sun, and the surface of the Earth heats up; this heat is then re-emitted from the Earth as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases absorb some of this heat and re-emit it, meaning that less heat is lost to space from the atmosphere. Without the greenhouse effect the Earth would be much cooler than it is. Since the industrial revolution in the late 1800s, the concentration of greenhouse gases, in particular carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, has increased. Most scientists believe that this increased concentration of greenhouse gases due to human activity has led to increased average global temperatures, commonly referred to as 'global warming'.\" \u2014Dr Laura Williams (INSPIRE scheme) inventors corner Chemical separations technology As founder of one of the first Imperial spin-out companies, Membrane Extraction Technology Ltd (MET), Professor Andrew Livingston (Chemical Engineering and Chemical Technology) has seen first-hand how research can be successfully translated for commercial applications.Professor Livingston originally formed MET in 1995 to develop molecule-separating membranes for treating chemical wastes in the chemicals processing industry. Membranes are conventionally used to remove impurities when refining substances like petrol, natural gas and pharmaceuti-cals, Professor Livingston quickly realised that he would need to develop more generic separation technologies, which could be applied in a number of sectors if the technology was to be a commercial success. By 2002 MET had produced a portfolio of tools including organic solvent nanofiltra-tion techniques for heavy metal removal, catalyst recovery, product purification, and solvent exchange, and a membrane aromatic recovery system for the recovery of aromatic acids and bases. These products are cur - rently being used to achieve chemical sepa-rations and improve chemical processes and are being utilised by major blue-chip manufacturers in the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries.Professor Livingston also leads the Separation Engineering and Technology (SET) research group and was recently appointed Head of the Department of Chemical Engineering and Chemical Technology. He believes that there is a synergy between his academic and com-mercial roles. \"They benefit each other,\" he explains. \"MET has enriched my academic life. I have industrial contacts for research projects and I can use my experiences to help my teaching.\" MET is now commercialising some of its membranes through in-house manufac-turing in west London, whereas previously their membranes were produced by a US partner. \"Starting to distribute our own membranes is very exciting,\" says Professor Livingston. \"I hope MET can continue to be a leader in this technology area.\" \u2014Michelle Cotterill, Imperial Innovations www.imperialinnovations.co.uk Organic solvent nanofiltration membranes are conventionally used to remove impurities when refining substances like petrol, natural gas and pharmaceuticals 10 www.imperial.ac.uk/reporter reporter 22 January 2009 Issue 200be a huge mistake to make these plans without taking climate change into consideration.\" Ocean modelling Another important research subject for the Institute is the ocean and how it will interact with changes in climate in the coming years. Since 2001 Dr Matt Piggott, the new Grantham Reader in Ocean Modelling, has been working in the Applied Modelling and Computation Group in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering. The group has developed a computer programme using advanced numerical techniques which mimics and represents the behaviour of the ocean. Working alongside mathematicians and oceanographers, Dr Piggott is now devel-oping a new type of model to simulate the ocean. He says: \"I'm trying to look at small scale aspects of the ocean at the same time as global scale circulation patterns. There are already very advanced models doing these two things separately but I'm trying to bring it all together to observe how the two scales interact with each other. For example, the model will enable us to see how changes of temperature in one area of the world can affect the entire ocean.\" The ocean modelling system Dr Piggott is working on could be used for a number of complex problems but an ultimate aim is that it will act as part of a climate forecasting system. Professor Hoskins explains: \"Matt's model is helping to make climate change predictions more robust and helping us understand more about oceanic processes. We could use it to answer questions such as: what would be the effect if ice in a particular area melts, and if there is a storm, which coastal areas would be affected? The glint in our eyes is that Matt's model should form the basis of the ocean component of a future climate change model.\" Solar photovoltaics Another area of new climate change research being conducted in the Grantham Institute focuses on solar photovoltaic cells which convert sunlight into electricity. Dr Ned Ekins-Daukes is a lecturer in the Department of Physics and is also conducting research for the Institute in the photovoltaic field. He explains that photo-voltaic research was prompted by the energy crises in the 1970s. In the 1990s, Japan introduced an effective photo- voltaic electricity scheme, which was followed by Germany in 2000 and has led to rapid growth of the industry. The reduction in manufacturing cost has been sufficiently great that photovoltaic electricity is projected to match consumer grid electricity prices in 2010 in Italy and 2016 in Germany. Currently, however, solar panel tech- nology is usually less than 20 per cent efficient. Dr Ekins-Daukes describes his research: \"I'm working to improve the power conversion efficiency of solar cells and exploring new ways of generating electricity from sunlight. The highest effi-ciency achieved at Imperial is 30.6 per cent and the thermodynamic limit to solar cell efficiency is 86.8 per cent, so in principle there is plenty of room for improvement. The challenge is to develop new materials with the appropriate properties. The cost of these high performance solar cell materials is high, but if inexpensive mirrors or lenses can be used to direct the sunlight onto small solar cells, the system cost can be greatly reduced, in some cases approaching the wholesale electricity price. The key to this approach is achieving high-efficiency Designing a brighter future continued from the centre pages solar power conversion.\" Commenting on Dr Ekins- Daukes's research, Professor Hoskins says: \"I hope Ned will be able to make breakthroughs in the solar photovoltaic area which will lead to solar cells becoming a much more realistic possibility in all areas of the world. Just imagine in a village in Africa\u2014instead of waiting for a whole renewable energy grid to be developed all you would need is to use photovoltaics as an individual energy source. If this technology could be made more readily available it would be really fantastic.\" A self confessed 'optimist' it is easy to be won over by Professor Hoskins' vision for the future\u2014and, after hearing the enthusiasm of the researchers for the innovative research being conducted at the Institute, one cannot help but agree with the Director's summation that the future is indeed bright. As Professor Hoskins concludes: \"The economic crisis isn't the end of the world: it simply means that we are going to have to produce even better work and be even more persuasive.\" \u2014Emily Ross, Communications 22 January 2009 Issue 200 reporter www.imperial.ac.uk/reporter 11 A simulation of deep convection in the ocean using the Imperial College Ocean Model computational code.

In 2009 a number of staff and students at Imperial will be keeping fit in a novel way, through prac-tising Filipino martial arts. The art form includes stick fighting, empty-handed tech-niques, kicking and awareness training. The Imperial Filipino Martial Arts Club was set up in August 2008, although College members have been learning and practising it for over four years. Amit Puri, a PhD student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, is the club's Chair. Describing the benefits of this particular martial art form over others, he said: \"It's very practical, you're learning ways to defend yourself and remain aware. You're taught armed and unarmed moves and there's a focus on improvisation.\" Amit only took up the martial arts 12 months ago but has been hooked ever since and is now considering an instructor qualification. He says: \"A staff member recommended it to me and I loved it. There's less drill then other martial arts and you get to mix it up a bit.\" The club runs evening and after - noon sessions and is open to staff and students. Techniques can be learnt by anyone regardless of their fitness level. Classes run on Mondays, 18.00-19.30, and Thursdays, 13.00-14.00, in the Student Union building. \u2014John-Paul Jones, Communications For more information email: filipino@imperial.ac.uk\"You're taught armed and unarmed moves and there's a focus on improvisation.\" Some tips for keeping safe on the streets from the Filipino martial arts club: 1. Try to avoid conflict where possible and walk or run away. 2. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially nearest exit routes so you can escape if necessary. 3. At night, stick to well-lit busy routes where there are other people around, and let someone know where you are, if alone. 4. If physically attacked, use a bag or umbrella to defend yourself and aid your escape.Running for Mumbai On 18 January, Gale Lewis, PA to Professor Desmond Johnston (Medicine), ran the Mumbai marathon for a charity called the Pavement Club, based near the central rail terminus in Mumbai. The charity helps over 90 children to receive basic education and regular hot meals. Many of the children live on the street or in slums and have no family so this is a vital activity for them, and offering them routine and contact with other children. On Friday nights the Pavement Club is open to all street dwellers around the terminus. Up to 300 people come for food and the chance to wash and be entertained. Gale says: \"The main terminus was hit badly during the Mumbai terrorist attacks last November and I suspect a number of these families would have been hurt and therefore I feel it is more important than ever to help.\" Gale trained for the marathon but she admits running in the Indian heat can take its toll. Speaking of her last experience she says: \"It's not a case of getting your best time\u2014it's a fantastic atmosphere. Children come out from their houses and are running alongside you\u2014it really is a lot of fun.\" Gale funded her own trip, and as there are no overheads, all of the money raised is spent directly on the children.

The event, called 'Cycling for Compassion, Caring, Connectivity' raised a phenomenal \u00a3250,000 for the following charities: Veerayatan Vidyapeeth (India), Rays of Sunshine Children's Charity (UK), and Naomi House Children's Hospice (UK). We cycled 300 kilometres of mixed terrain\u2014rough roads with pot-holes, Indian highways, through rural villages, muddy roads, sandy roads, mountains, lakes, valleys, and not to mention dodging cows, camels, goats, and water-buffaloes!

The Hamilton Building at Silwood, which was previously owned by the Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International, has been bought by the College and converted to provide over 100 students with a suite of flexible seminar rooms, a cutting edge teaching laboratory, laboratories for project work, a 60-seat IT suite, a new library and breakout areas for group work. The Hamilton Building will bring together all postgraduate training at Silwood under one roof, providing a focal point for the expanding community of students at the campus. One hundred and nine students are currently studying for Master's degrees at Silwood in a range of bio-logical and ecological subjects, from entomology to conservation science. Professor Ian Owens, Head of the Department of Life Sciences, comments: \"Before now, our training and workshop facilities were spread across Silwood's large campus in many different, often old, buildings. With student numbers growing every year, and plans for additional courses in the future, we need cen- tralised, purpose-built facilities to support these scientists at the start of their career. Our vision is that the Hamilton Building will act as the campus' hub, building on the strong sense of community that already exists here at Silwood, whilst ensuring that our students have access to the best kit for their lab and computer work.\" \u2014Danielle Reeves, CommunicationsNew look SCR The Senior Common Room (SCR) on the South Kensington Campus has been revamped over the winter break to offer staff and PhD students a wider selection of hot and cold snacks, increased seating and a newly designed caf\u00e9 bar area. Other improvements include new furniture, a rainbow- coloured carpet and a retractable 'acoustic wall' which can divide the room into two versatile spaces for functions and events. The SCR provides food and drink to an average of 1,500 staff and PhD students a day and the space is also used for informal meetings. Dan Curtis (Estates), who led the project, says: \"The new design had to reflect the many functions of the SCR, and offer quality contemporary architecture for a wide spectrum of users.\" Vishal Joneja, SCR Manager, is delighted with his new work- place. He says: \"The SCR looks fresh and welcoming and the extra seating and the new caf\u00e9 provision will really help us deliver an even better service to our users.\" The SCR restaurant is open for breakfast between 08.00 and 10.30 and for lunch between 11.45 and 15.00 Monday to Friday. The caf\u00e9 bar is open from 08.00 to 18.00. \u2014Leena Barrett, Commercial Services For more information, see: www.imperial.ac.uk/eatinganddrinking How to get more done in 2009 With the holidays behind us, we resume ongoing projects and start new activities. But how do we ensure that our energies are well directed to produce clear results? Faced with a list of jobs to complete, it can be difficult to decide what to do and how to concentrate our efforts. That's where effective prioritising can help. Here's one simple yet effective method to help you prioritise with the help of few Post It notes and a large piece of paper. What to do: 1. Decide on the time period for prioritising: a week, fortnight, or a month. 2. Write each major project or task that you think needs doing in that time on a separate Post It. The Post Its should cover all the things you need or want to do. 3. Draw a bullseye chart with five rings on the piece of paper. 4. Place the Post Its within the rings. Those closest to the centre should show tasks you see as the most important. 5. Only one Post It can be placed in the centre, with others distributed to all the rings. 6. Post Its might need to be readjusted and one or two might end up outside the bullseye chart. 7. When completed, allocate work time (one or two hours per day) to the central activity 8. Start each day by working on your central activity and stick with it. 9. When the central activity is complete or new work comes in, rearrange the Post It notes to create a new focus.When the set time is up, review the result. 10. Share your learning with others. \u2014Magdalena Bak- Maier, Learning and Development Consultant If you have a good method for prioritising email Magdalena at: m.bak- maier@imperial.ac.uk 22 January 2009 Issue 200 reporter www.imperial.ac.uk/reporter 13 20 years Professor Paul Abel, Professor of Urology (SORA) Paul Abel first came to the Hammersmith Hospital as a Registrar in 1982 and in 1989 was appointed Senior Lecturer at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School which later became part of Imperial. Since then he has also held the position of Honorary Consultant Urologist at the Hammer - smith and Charing Cross Hospitals and became a Professor of Urology in Imperial's SORA Division 18 months ago. His research interests include the use of oestrogen patches to treat advanced prostate cancer, high-intensity focussed ultrasound to destroy cancerous tissue non-invasively, and taking low intensity clinical urology work into the community. \"Over the past 20 years,\" he says, \"urology management has changed hugely, with new ther - apeutic and diagnostic techniques enabling us to more accurately assess each patient and tailor their treatment.\" Professor Abel is particularly enthused that the atmosphere and traditions of the Royal Postgraduate Medical School are being revived as part of the AHSC. Karen Linfield, Clinical Affairs Coordinator, Division of Investigative Sciences Karen Linfield joined the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Ham- mersmith, in 1989 as Secretary to Professor John Goldman, head of the leukaemia unit. Over the years, her role has developed and a key responsibility now is administering Leuka, an in-house charity, set up by one of Professor Goldman's former patients, which helps to support the costs of research into the causes and treatment of leukaemia at the Hammer - smith Hospital. She has been involved with a number of the charity's fundraising events including Who's Cooking Dinner?, a gastronomic event featuring well-known chefs cooking for tables of 10 guests, and a bike ride from Geneva to Cannes. These events have helped to raise more than \u00a33 million so far. At Hammersmith, Karen also liaises with overseas doctors and medical students. In her spare time, Karen loves cooking and travels extensively.Dr Paul Barton Reader (NHLI) Gill Martin Senior Support Technician (NHLI) Professor Mike Warner Professor of Geo- physics (Earth Science and Engineering) Dr Richard Williams Senior Lecturer (Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology) 30 years Jeff Brooks Technician (Estates) Adrian Clark Team Leader: Natural Sciences (Library Services) Dr Pradeep Luther Principal Research Fellow (NHLI)Paul Stokes Senior Library Assistant (Library Services) Harry Vine Departmental Services Manager (Physics) 40 years Catherine Ambrose, Personal Assistant (NHLI) Catherine Ambrose has worked for 40 years at the Institute of Diseases of the Chest (now the Cardiotho- racic Institute) at the Royal Brompton Campus.

Professor Richard Selley pays tribute: \"Bob graduated in Geology from Cambridge in 1951 and spent the next 18 months with the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, carrying out geological expeditions in Antarctica. On his return he was awarded the Polar Silver Medal and married palaeobotanist Hilda Cox. Bob spent the next 25 years as an explorationist with BP in a number of countries including Alaska where he led the team responsible for the discovery in 1968 of Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in North America. In 1978 Bob took up the Chair of Petroleum Geology at Imperial. He revitalised the MSc Petroleum Geology course and was a founder of the joint Association for Petroleum Exploration courses which combined the forces of Imperial, the Petroleum Exploration Society of Great Britain and the Geological Society of London. Bob published seminal contributions to the petro- leum geology of several parts of the world, for which he received the Coke Medal and the Petroleum Group silver medal. He was awarded the Geologists' Associa-tion's Halstead Medal and the MacKay Hammer by the Geological Society of New Zealand. Bob's name lives on in Antarctica: Stoneley Point sits at the entrance to Whisky Bay on James Ross Island. Also, the Stoneley Medal is awarded to participants in the American Association of Petroleum Geologists' annual student competition based on Imperial's Barrel Award: a key element of the MSc Petroleum Geoscience course.

Volunteers should be available at a pre-agreed time in a library or community venue. The job of the volunteers is to be ready to assist and provide trouble-shooting tips for groups of three to six people. All the residents are beginners so volunteers need to be patient, friendly and have fluent and clear English. You do not need any teaching qualifications but simple use of keyboard, mouse, email and internet is required.

The survey takes place twice a year, seeking the views of all students at the end of the academic year and specifically targeting newly enrolled students in the autumn. Students have the opportunity to tell us about their experiences of applying to the College, of learning and living at Imperial, and offer opinions on the level of support Imperial provides. The presentation will be held on Friday 13 February at 10.30 at the Read Lecture Theatre, Level 5, Sherfield Building on the South Kensington Campus.
