[Negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are associated with distinct motivational deficits in treatment resistant schizophrenia.](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1518356) BACKGROUND: Motivational deficits are a central feature of the negative syndrome in schizophrenia. They have consistently been associated with reduced willingness to expend physical effort in return for monetary rewards on effort based decision making (EBDM) paradigms. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying such altered performance are not well characterised, and it remains unclear if they are driven purely by negative symptoms, or also in part by cognitive impairment, antipsychotic treatment or even positive symptoms. Here we investigated the impact of all these factors using a paradigm that has not previously been used to measure EBDM in schizophrenia. METHODS: Forty treatment resistant schizophrenia (TRS) patients on clozapine and matched controls (N = 80) completed a well validated EBDM task which offers monetary rewards in return for physical effort. Choice and reaction time data was analysed using logistic regressions, as well as Bayesian hierarchical drift diffusion modelling (HDDM). Behavioural parameters were compared between groups and their association with negative symptoms, cognitive function and serum clozapine levels were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, TRS patients accepted significantly less offers than controls during effort-based decision making, suggesting they were less motivated. They demonstrated reduced sensitivity to increasing rewards, but surprisingly were also less averse to increasing effort. Despite a positive correlation between negative symptoms and cognitive function in TRS, reward sensitivity was associated only with cognitive performance. In contrast, reduced effort aversion correlated with negative symptom severity. Clozapine levels and positive symptoms were not associated with either behavioural parameter. CONCLUSION: Motivational deficits in TRS are characterised by both diminished reward sensitivity and reduced effort aversion during EBDM. Cognitive dysfunction and negative symptom severity account for distinct aspects of these behavioural changes, despite positive associations between themselves. Overall, these findings demonstrate that negative symptoms and cognitive impairment have significant independent contributions to EBDM in TRS, thereby opening the possibility of individualised treatment targeting these mechanisms to improve motivation. [Longitudinal Retinal Changes in MOGAD](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1269527) ObjectivePatients with myelin oligodendrocyte (MOGIgG)associated disease (MOGAD) from severe optic neuritis (ON) leading to retinal neuroaxonal loss, which can be quantified by optical coherence tomography (OCT). We assessed whether ONindependent retinal atrophy can be detected in MOGAD.MethodsEighty patients with MOGAD and 139 healthy controls (HCs) were included. OCT data was acquired with (1) Spectralis spectral domain OCT (MOGAD: N = 66 and HCs: N = 103) and (2) Cirrus highdefinition OCT (MOGAD: N = 14 and HCs: N = 36). Macular combined ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) were quantified.ResultsAt baseline, GCIPL and pRNFL were lower in MOGAD eyes with a history of ON (MOGADON) compared with MOGAD eyes without a history of ON (MOGADNON) and HCs (p < 0.001). MOGADNON eyes had lower GCIPL volume compared to HCs (p < 0.001) in the Spectralis, but not in the Cirrus cohort. Longitudinally (followup up to 3 years), MOGADON with ON within the last 6-12 months before baseline exhibited greater pRNFL thinning than MOGADON with an ON greater than 12 months ago (p < 0.001). The overall MOGAD cohort did not exhibit faster GCIPL thinning compared with the HC cohort.InterpretationOur study suggests the absence of attackindependent retinal damage in patients with MOGAD. Yet, ongoing neuroaxonal damage or edema resolution seems to occur for up to 12 months after ON, which is longer than what has been reported with other ON forms. These findings support that the pathomechanisms underlying optic nerve involvement and the evolution of OCT retinal changes after ON is distinct in patients with MOGAD. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:476-485 [Morphological and functional variability in subcentral cortex of the human brain](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1096726) AbstractThere is a long-established link between anatomy and function in the somatomotor system in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The morphology of the central sulcus is predictive of the location of functional activation peaks relating to movement of different effectors in individuals. By contrast, morphological variation in the subcentral region and its relationship to function is, as yet, unknown. Investigating the subcentral region is particularly important in the context of speech, since control of the larynx during human speech production is related to activity in this region. Here, we examined the relationship between morphology in the central and subcentral region and the location of functional activity during movement of the hand, lips, tongue, and larynx at the individual participant level. We provide a systematic description of the sulcal patterns of the subcentral and adjacent opercular cortex, including the inter-individual variability in sulcal morphology. We show that, in the majority of participants, the anterior subcentral sulcus is not continuous, but consists of two distinct segments. A robust relationship between morphology of the central and subcentral sulcal segments and movement of different effectors is demonstrated. Inter-individual variability of underlying anatomy might thus explain previous inconsistent findings, in particular regarding the ventral larynx area in subcentral cortex. A surface registration based on sulcal labels indicated that such anatomical information can improve the alignment of functional data for group studies.

[NO-Sensitive Guanylate Cyclase Isoforms NO-GC1 involving cGMP. For survival of cochlear hair cells and preservation of hearing, NO-mediated cascades have both protective and detrimental potential. Here we examine the cochlear function of mice lacking one of the two NO-sensitive guanylate cyclase isoforms [NO-GC1 knockout deletion of NO-GC1 or NO-GC2 did not influence electromechanical outer hair cell (OHC) properties, as measured by distortion product otoacoustic emissions, neither before nor after noise exposure, nor were click- or noise-burst-evoked auditory brainstem response thresholds different from controls. Yet inner hair cell (IHC) ribbons and auditory nerve responses showed significantly less deterioration in NO-GC1 KO and NO-GC2 KO mice after noise exposure. Consistent with a selective role of NO-GC in IHCs, NO-GC 1 mRNA was found in isolated IHCs but not in OHCs. Using transgenic mice expressing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based cGMP biosensor cGi500, in IHCs but not in OHCs. Pharmacologic long-term treatment with a NO-GC stimulator altered auditory nerve responses but did not affect OHC function and hearing thresholds. Interestingly, NO-GC stimulation exacerbated the loss of auditory nerve response in aged animals but attenuated the loss in younger animals. We propose NO-GC2 and, to some degree, NO-GC1 as targets for early pharmacologic prevention of auditory fiber loss (synaptopathy). Both isoforms provide selective benefits for hearing function by maintaining the functional integrity of auditory nerve fibers in early life rather than at old age. [Language-driven anticipatory eye movements in virtual reality.](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1173823) Predictive language processing is often studied by measuring eye movements as participants look at objects on a computer screen while they listen to spoken sentences. This variant of the visual-world paradigm has revealed that information encountered by a listener at a spoken verb can give rise to anticipatory eye movements to a target object, which is taken to indicate that people predict upcoming words. The ecological validity of such findings remains questionable, however, because these computer experiments used two-dimensional stimuli that were mere abstractions of real-world objects. Here we present a visual-world paradigm study in a three-dimensional (3-D) immersive virtual reality environment. Despite significant changes in the stimulus materials and the different mode of stimulus presentation, language-mediated anticipatory eye movements were still observed. These findings thus indicate that people do predict upcoming words during language comprehension in a more naturalistic setting where natural depth cues are preserved. Moreover, the results confirm the feasibility of using eyetracking in rich and multimodal 3-D virtual environments. [Broca's area and the search for anatomical asymmetry: commentary and perspectives.](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1191075) We present a brief commentary on the field's search for an anatomical asymmetry between Broca's area and its homologue in the non-dominant hemisphere, focusing on a selection of studies, including research from the last decade. We demonstrate that, several years after the influential review of Keller and colleagues from 2009, and despite recent advances in neuroimaging, the existence of a structural asymmetry of Broca's area is still controversial. This is especially the case for studies of the macroanatomy of this region. We point out the inconsistencies in methodology across studies that could account for the discrepancy in results. Investigations of the microstructure of Broca's area show a trend of a leftward asymmetry, but it is still unclear how these results relate to language dominance. We suggest that it may be necessary to combine multiple metrics in a systematic manner to find robust asymmetries and to expand the regional scope of structural investigations. Finally, based on the current state of the literature, we should not rule out the possibility that language dominance may simply not be reflected in local anatomical differences in the brain. [A dual larynx motor networks hypothesis.](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1207836) Humans are vocal modulators par excellence. This ability is supported in part by the dual representation of the laryngeal muscles in the motor cortex. Movement, however, is not the product of motor cortex alone but of a broader motor network. This network consists of brain regions that contain somatotopic maps that parallel the organization in motor cortex. We therefore present a novel hypothesis that the dual laryngeal representation is repeated throughout the broader motor network. In support of the hypothesis, we review existing literature that demonstrates the existence of network-wide somatotopy and present initial evidence for the hypothesis' plausibility. Understanding how this uniquely human phenotype in motor cortex interacts with broader brain networks is an important step toward understanding how humans evolved the ability to speak. We further suggest that this system may provide a means to study how individual components of the nervous system evolved within the context of neuronal networks.

[A comprehensive atlas of white matter tracts in the chimpanzee.](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1151686) Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are, along with bonobos, humans' closest living relatives. The advent of diffusion MRI tractography in recent years has allowed a resurgence of comparative neuroanatomical studies in humans and other primate species. Here we offer, in comparative perspective, the first chimpanzee white matter atlas, constructed from in vivo chimpanzee diffusion-weighted scans. Comparative white matter atlases provide a useful tool for identifying neuroanatomical differences and similarities between humans and other primate species. Until now, comprehensive fascicular atlases have been created for humans (Homo sapiens), rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), and several other nonhuman primate species, but never in a nonhuman ape. Information on chimpanzee neuroanatomy is essential for understanding the anatomical specializations of white matter organization that are unique to the human lineage. [Does the temporal cortex make us human? A review of structural and functional diversity of the primate temporal lobe.](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1196807) Temporal cortex is a primate specialization that shows considerable variation in size, morphology, and connectivity across species. Human temporal cortex is involved in many behaviors that are considered especially well developed in humans, including semantic processing, language, and theory of mind. Here, we ask whether the involvement of temporal cortex in these behaviors can be explained in the context of the 'general' primate organization of the temporal lobe or whether the human temporal lobe contains unique specializations indicative of a 'step change' in the lineage leading to modern humans. We propose that many human behaviors can be explained as elaborations of temporal cortex functions observed in other primates. However, changes in temporal lobe white matter suggest increased integration of information within temporal cortex and between posterior temporal cortex and other association areas, which likely enable behaviors not possible in other species. [Cross-species cortical alignment identifies different types of anatomical reorganization in the primate temporal lobe](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1095387) Evolutionary adaptations of temporo-parietal cortex are considered to be a critical specialization of the human brain. Cortical adaptations, however, can affect different aspects of brain architecture, including local expansion of the cortical sheet or changes in connectivity between cortical areas. We distinguish different types of changes in brain architecture using a computational neuroanatomy approach. We investigate the extent to which between-species alignment, based on cortical myelin, can predict changes in connectivity patterns across macaque, chimpanzee, and human. We show that expansion and relocation of brain areas can predict terminations of several white matter tracts in temporo-parietal cortex, including the middle and superior longitudinal fasciculus, but not the arcuate fasciculus. This demonstrates that the arcuate fasciculus underwent additional evolutionary modifications affecting the temporal lobe connectivity pattern. This approach can flexibly be extended to include other features of cortical organization and other species, allowing direct tests of comparative hypotheses of brain organization. [Mapping Human Laryngeal Motor Cortex during Vocalization](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1122796) Abstract The representations of the articulators involved in human speech production are organized somatotopically in primary motor cortex. The neural representation of the larynx, however, remains debated. Both a dorsal and a ventral larynx representation have been previously described. It is unknown, however, whether both representations are located in primary motor cortex. Here, we mapped the motor representations of the human larynx using functional magnetic resonance imaging and characterized the cortical microstructure underlying the activated regions. We isolated brain activity related to laryngeal activity during vocalization while controlling for breathing. We also mapped the articulators (the lips and tongue) and the hand area. We found two separate activations during vocalization\u2014a dorsal and a ventral larynx representation. Structural and quantitative neuroimaging revealed that myelin content and cortical thickness underlying the dorsal, but not the ventral larynx representation, are similar to those of other primary motor representations. This finding confirms that the dorsal larynx representation is located in primary motor cortex and that the ventral one is not. We further speculate that the location of the ventral larynx representation is in premotor cortex, as seen in other primates. It remains unclear, however, whether and how these two representations differentially contribute to "}
