When the 'back-to-school vibes' start filling the September air, the days slowly get cozier and more introverted. It has a different feel from New Year's and springtime, autumn has its own flavour of 'fresh start' energy. It brings with it a thirst for knowledge, a lust for literature, and a call to the classroom. The School of Homeopathy begins its Attendance Courses in September, the beginning of academic year in the UK. Whatever your reason, the study of homeopathy, is an amazing discovery of self development and learning that leads to a new job and way of life. So why not change career, learn something new and get inspired. Work in healthcare and be your own boss - become a homeopath. Our 4 year attendance course has in-person classes held just one weekend a month, 10 months of the year. Between the attendance weekends home-directed study is completed, plus you have access to the Online Learning System. From year one you have access to the online clinics to gain clinical observation hours. The School of Homeopathy will always have a very special place in my heart. Not only because of the beauty of the house and garden and the depth of our study of the healing art of Homeopathy, but also the love and the humour that we all shared. Vanessa, Graduate By joining the attendance course and attending in person each month you get to know the instructors and administrators, as well as your fellow learners. Group numbers are kept low, ensuring everyone is heard, and we strive to be attentive to everyone's individual learning style. The atmosphere is one of support, trust and cooperation, within which self-reflection and openness is encouraged. The attendance weekends are held at the beautiful Hawkwood in Gloucestershire (UK). Hawkwood is a perfect setting for the study of homeopathy. It is a 19th century country house nestled in 42 acres of beautiful gardens, woods, and fields, providing a tranquil retreat perfect for reflective study. Meals and accommodations are all available on site, and the teaching rooms are filled with light, warmth, and serenity. Studying at the School is like stepping into another world. You leave the mad pace of life behind and enter a welcome haven of tranquility. Barbara, Student During your time in the attendance course, a deep camaraderie develops among the students, and between the students and faculty. It's easy to ask questions along the way during teaching, and you begin to develop a great sense of community, fully immersed as you are in a nurturing, expansive weekend of homeopathy. You can mingle with students from other years between classes, expanding your circle of homeopathy friends and gaining from their knowledge. This School is more than a school, it's a place where you're held as a family, where you're able to grow. Kathryn, Graduate We are proud to be the oldest and most established homeopathy school in the UK. Our certification is highly regarded by the homeopathic community in the UK and internationally, and fully recognised by the Society of Homeopaths. We offer in-depth clinical observation training, and you learn from over 30 of the world's finest homeopathy teachers. We pride ourselves on our student support, and you receive ongoing and individual care and feedback. Not only did I receive the best homeopathic education, one that is actually world renowned, but I received something that changed my life in the best way possible. Sue, Graduate When studying with us you learn from an enthusiastic and committed team of teachers, including world-renowned homeopaths, offering a wealth of homeopathic experience. Each is a busy practitioner in their own right, and all are dedicated to sharing their knowledge, developing great homeopaths, and improving the quality of life for students and their patients. They each bring their own philosophy and perspective to the course, so you leave with a well-rounded education. There is an openness to look at things with fresh eyes - this school has not stayed in the past but has absorbed different influences from homeopathic teachers and incorporated them into the syllabus. David Mundy, Teacher If attendance study isn't right for you, there are also online and correspondence versions of the course available. However, if you are considering the attendance course, it does start in September, so don't hesitate to reach out to us to have a chat and learn more, or to enrol. Of course, nothing beats hearing from people who've actually done the course. So we've made a series of short videos chatting with students about their experience on the course. So grab a cuppa, cozy in, and hear about the course from the real experts... the students themselves: [www.homeopathyschool.com/why-study-with-us/testimonials/videos/](https://www.homeopathyschool.com/why-study-with-us/testimonials/videos/) We'd love to hear from you!
