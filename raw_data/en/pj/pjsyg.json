The benefits of these foods are due to the presence of active compounds such as carotenoids, collagen hydrolysate, and dietary fibers. Nutraceuticals have been found to positively affect cardiovascular and immune system health and have a role in infection and cancer prevention. Nutraceuticals can be categorized into different classes based on their nature and mode of action. In this review, different classifications of nutraceuticals and their potential therapeutic activity, such as anti-cancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-lipid activity in disease will be reviewed. Moreover, the different mechanisms of action of these products, applications, and safety upon consumers including current trends and future prospect of nutraceuticals will be included.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-04-27", "cleaned_text": "Considerations [https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26092540](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26092540) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-molecules-26-02540)]. The Greek physician Hippocrates adopted the philosophy of food as medicine, with his renowned quote \"Let food be the medicine and medicine be the food\" [ [2](#B2-molecules-26-02540)]. Throughout human history, many natural sources were utilized for their healing and strength restoring effects upon consumption, such as cinnamon, saffron, honey, garlic, ginger, pomegranate, mint, and many more [ [3](#B3-molecules-26-02540)]. [4](#B4-molecules-26-02540)]. Nutraceuticals comprise a wide range of bioactive derivatives accumulated in edible sources including antioxidants, phytochemicals, fatty acids, amino acids, and probiotics. With either established previously or potential effects, nutraceuticals are well-known for their role of being involved in disease treatment and prevention, anti-aging properties, and malignancy prevention. Consuming probiotics is encouraged due to its significant role in the treatment and prevention of gastroenterological diseases [ [5](#B5-molecules-26-02540)]. Garlic, for example, has been suggested as a complementary therapy for high blood pressure and cholesterol [ [6](#B6-molecules-26-02540)]. [7](#B7-molecules-26-02540), [8](#B8-molecules-26-02540), [9](#B9-molecules-26-02540), [10](#B10-molecules-26-02540)]. [11](#B11-molecules-26-02540)]. [12](#B12-molecules-26-02540)]. 2. Source, Nature and Application [13](#B13-molecules-26-02540), [14](#B14-molecules-26-02540)]. Nutraceuticals with their different classes have a variety of applications and uses depending on their nature. The following subsections will discuss different nutraceutical classes. [Table 1](#molecules-26-02540-t001)also summarizes the classes of nutraceuticals with their beneficial effects to health. [15](#B15-molecules-26-02540)]. Traditional nutraceuticals are defined as natural foods with their potential health attributes: this may include, but is not limited to, fruits, vegetables, grains, fish, dairy and meat products [ [16](#B16-molecules-26-02540)]. Traditional foods or nutraceuticals can positively affect health by stimulating the immune system, and lowering the risk of heart diseases and cancers [ [17](#B17-molecules-26-02540), [18](#B18-molecules-26-02540), [19](#B19-molecules-26-02540)]. Looking at these definitions, the conclusion we have drawn is that nutraceuticals can be classified into traditional and non-traditional groups. Further subclassification of each will be discussed below, although some may overlap. 2.1. Traditional Nutraceuticals and Products 2.1.1. Functional Foods [13](#B13-molecules-26-02540), [20](#B20-molecules-26-02540)]. These foods have ingredients that enhance antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, which are functional to prevent diseases such as type-2 diabetes [ [21](#B21-molecules-26-02540)]. These foods are made available for daily consumption for a specific population with a similar quality of other traditional foods in the market [ [22](#B22-molecules-26-02540), [23](#B23-molecules-26-02540)]. Examples of these functional foods are rice, wheat, kidney beans, soybeans, lentils, chocolate, citrus fruits, nuts, and fermented milk [ [13](#B13-molecules-26-02540), [24](#B24-molecules-26-02540)]. Rice is the first staple food consumed by the majority of populations; its nutritional value is as a source of carbohydrates, containing low levels of fat, salt and sugar, because all types of rice are gluten free and contain resistant starch that helps in the growth of healthy bowel bacteria [ [25](#B25-molecules-26-02540)]. Traditional rice varieties in India represent a great origin of minerals and vitamins such as niacin, thiamine, iron, riboflavin, vitamin D, and calcium; in addition, they hold higher fiber and lower amounts of sugar [ [26](#B26-molecules-26-02540)]. Wheat is the second staple food consumed across the world: wholegrain wheat is made up of three layers which are the bran, the endosperm, and the germ; wholegrain wheat can be processed to produce wheat bran and wheat germ [ [27](#B27-molecules-26-02540)]. Wheat brans represent the most beneficial part of wholegrain wheat due it their fiber content which is believed to play a role in improving gastrointestinal health [ [28](#B28-molecules-26-02540)]. [29](#B29-molecules-26-02540)]. Although functional foods have various health benefits due to several active ingredients, more studies with scientific evidence are needed to provide these products with health claims in their labels [ [22](#B22-molecules-26-02540), [30](#B30-molecules-26-02540), [31](#B31-molecules-26-02540), [32](#B32-molecules-26-02540)]. Some of the active ingredients in functional foods are carotenoids, collagen hydrolysate, dietary fibers, and fatty acids that possess various health benefits such as anti-inflammatory activity and enhance body immunity. In the following subsections, the nature and various health benefits of these functional ingredients will be discussed. 2.1.2. Carotenoids [33](#B33-molecules-26-02540), [34](#B34-molecules-26-02540)]. They are renowned for their wide spectrum of beneficial effects to health, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [ [35](#B35-molecules-26-02540)]. In addition, carotenoids exert health benefits over human vision, cognitive functions, heart functions, cancer prevention, and immune functions [ [36](#B36-molecules-26-02540), [37](#B37-molecules-26-02540), [38](#B38-molecules-26-02540)]. A study revealed the anti-inflammatory activity of two forms of carotenoids, astaxanthin and -carotene, where both were found to be able to suppress the inflammation induced by Helicobacter pylori by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species and diminishing the level of inflammatory mediators being expressed [ [39](#B39-molecules-26-02540)]. [40](#B40-molecules-26-02540)]. Although carotenoids exhibit radical scavenging activity, which aids in diseases associated with increased oxidative stress, they also exhibit cyto-genotoxic activity. 2.1.3. Collagen Hydrolysate [41](#B41-molecules-26-02540), [42](#B42-molecules-26-02540)]. A study has shown the immune-boosting effects of collagen hydrolysates that have been extracted from domestic yak (Bos grunniens) bone and its potential in improving the adaptive and innate immunity in mice [ [43](#B43-molecules-26-02540)]. Furthermore, a study conducted to investigate the health benefits of collagen hydrolysate in females diagnosed with photoaged skin showed a remarkable improvement in skin hydration, wrinkling, and elasticity [ [44](#B44-molecules-26-02540)]. 2.1.4. Dietary Fibers [45](#B45-molecules-26-02540), [46](#B46-molecules-26-02540), [47](#B47-molecules-26-02540)]. Dietary fibers can be classified into more than two categories on the basis of their solubility in hot water, water-retaining capacity, and viscosity into soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibers comprise viscous components such as -glucans, fructans, and non-viscous fibers such as hemicellulose. Insoluble fibers tend to lose the characteristic of viscosity and they are insoluble in water; insoluble fibers tend to accelerate gastric emptying time which helps in relieving constipation, while soluble fibers tend to delay gastric emptying time [ [48](#B48-molecules-26-02540)]. High fiber diets are found to have a positive impact on inflammatory bowel diseases, because they can lessen the risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative Phytochemicals can help in maintaining chemical balance of the brain, thus providing neuroprotective activity [ [51](#B51-molecules-26-02540)]. Additionally, high consumption of vegetables and fruits that contain phytochemicals can reduce the risk of cancers, and cardiac and neurodegenerative disorders [ [29](#B29-molecules-26-02540), [51](#B51-molecules-26-02540)]. 2.1.7. Herbs [52](#B52-molecules-26-02540)]. Herbs that are rich in antioxidant have been used in flavoring and aroma for more than two thousand years [ [53](#B53-molecules-26-02540)]. Garlic extracts, ginger root, and aloe gel are herbs that have health benefits such as reducing cholesterol, wound healing, and anti-ulcer and antioxidant activities [ [13](#B13-molecules-26-02540), [54](#B54-molecules-26-02540)]. 2.1.8. Probiotics [55](#B55-molecules-26-02540)]. In addition, these live microbes can improve microbial intestinal balance. Lactobacillus with its different species is the most common probiotic used that will survive in the human gut. Currently, Bifidobacterium spp., and Streptococcus are also used [56](#B56-molecules-26-02540)]. 2.1.9. Prebiotics [57](#B57-molecules-26-02540)]. These prebiotics are literally fertilizing agents for probiotics that are not affected by gastric pH and stomach acids [ [13](#B13-molecules-26-02540)]. Prebiotics are non-digestible ingredients that promote the growth of productive microorganism and affect the composition and activity of gut microbiota. Fructo-oligosaccharides and inulin are examples of prebiotics used in functional foods to improve gastric health [ [57](#B57-molecules-26-02540), [58](#B58-molecules-26-02540)]. 2.1.10. Dietary Supplements [13](#B13-molecules-26-02540), [59](#B59-molecules-26-02540)]. These supplements are found in various forms, such as tablets, liquid-based, capsules, powder, and concentrated with specific doses [ [2](#B2-molecules-26-02540), [60](#B60-molecules-26-02540)]. Omega-3, vitamins A, B, C, D, and E, iron, folic acid, minerals, calcium, magnesium, etc., are some examples of dietary supplements that can either be taken by an individual with or without prescription [ [2](#B2-molecules-26-02540), [59](#B59-molecules-26-02540)]. Moreover, these supplements can be consumed to ensure that a diet meets the sufficient nutrient requirements for the body and to prevent any deficiencies [ [61](#B61-molecules-26-02540)]. At the beginning of the 20th century, food extracts that contain important nutrients such as vitamin C, and B were shown to be helpful to prevent some serious conditions such as scurvy, pellagra, and [63](#B63-molecules-26-02540)]. Rice enriched with -carotene, and cereals infused with vitamins and minerals are some examples of this class of nutraceuticals which contain provitamin A that can boost [60](#B60-molecules-26-02540)]. These foods supply the body with important nutrients that can prevent anemia and improve health [ [2](#B2-molecules-26-02540), [66](#B66-molecules-26-02540)]. For example, if calcium is added to specific food such as orange juice, the orange juice can enhance glycemic control [ [67](#B67-molecules-26-02540), [68](#B68-molecules-26-02540)]. 2.2.2. Recombinant Nutraceuticals [14](#B14-molecules-26-02540)]. This type of foods and crops are genetically modified to develop products that contain recombinant compounds and proteins that would be make them more beneficial to health [ [69](#B69-molecules-26-02540)]. Iron rice, golden rice, maize, golden mustard, multivitamin corn, and gold kiwifruit are examples of these nutraceuticals. Gold kiwifruit contains a recombinant gene that increases ascorbic acid levels, carotenoid, and lutein to enhance immune function. Additionally, it is considered a source of vitamins, potassium and fiber [ on Modes of Action [87](#B87-molecules-26-02540)]. Many nutraceutical supplements have shown a positive impact on cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and immune functions [ [88](#B88-molecules-26-02540), [89](#B89-molecules-26-02540), [90](#B90-molecules-26-02540)]. Generally, nutraceutical modes of action take place to increase functional components which will lead to health enhancement [ [91](#B91-molecules-26-02540)]. This section will discuss various biological activities in nutraceuticals. 3.1. Anti-Cancer Activity [92](#B92-molecules-26-02540)]. Furthermore, nutraceuticals have been found to attenuate cancer signaling pathways that are believed to play a role in carcinogenesis [ [93](#B93-molecules-26-02540)]. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate nutraceuticals' modes of action against various types of cancer, and a wide range of nutraceuticals have been found to express anti-cancer properties against oral cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer cells [ [94](#B94-molecules-26-02540), [95](#B95-molecules-26-02540)]. [96](#B96-molecules-26-02540), [97](#B97-molecules-26-02540)]. This receptor is an intracellular nuclear receptor found in organs and tissues. The active form of vitamin D binds to VDR, leading to activation of the growth arrest gene and DNA-damage-inducible gene [ [96](#B96-molecules-26-02540), [97](#B97-molecules-26-02540)]. This concludes that vitamin D deficiency would give rise to many diseases, while sufficient intake of vitamin D aids in disease prevention. In addition, the potentials of vitamins such as vitamin A, C and D have been studied for their mechanisms as anti-cancer agents. On the other hand, complementary therapy incorporating the nutraceutical herb Clinacanthus nutans and gemcitabine has been investigated. It has been found that application of C. nutans alone or combined with gemcitabine exhibited anti-proliferative effects on pancreatic cancer cells. The summary of this combinatory therapy is the upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2, cIAP-2, human pancreatic cancer cells [ [98](#B98-molecules-26-02540)]. [99](#B99-molecules-26-02540)]. Similarly, a study aiming to investigate the prophylactic activity of Lactobacillus rhamnosus on the carcinogenesis of CRC showed that oral administration of this probiotic inhibited inflammation associated with tumor development by observing an increase in the expression of inflammatory proteins such as NFB-p65, TNF and iNOS [ [100](#B100-molecules-26-02540)]. Moreover, tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity, and tumor size are all reduced via consumption of probiotics Lactobacilus acidophilus, Bifidobacteria spp., and a maltodextrin [ [101](#B101-molecules-26-02540)]. Additionally, the synbiotic mechanism lies in facilitating apoptotic responses to carcinogenesis-induced DNA damage in the colon, SCFA production, and downregulation of carcinogenic enzymes [ [102](#B102-molecules-26-02540)]. This concludes that the consumption of prebiotics and probiotics exerts immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity and increases lactic acid-producing bacteria, which in return express their anti-cancer activity in colorectal cancer. [103](#B103-molecules-26-02540)]. A study investigating habitual green tea consumption among human subjects revealed that Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) reduced the risk of prostate cancer [ [104](#B104-molecules-26-02540)]. Furthermore, the treatment of prostatic carcinoma cell line PC-3 with green tea polyphenol E induced cell death by prompting intracellular oxidative stress that subsequently inhibits the pro-survival pathway Akt [ [105](#B105-molecules-26-02540)]. Additionally, the administration of EGCG demonstrated an inhibitory effect on lung cancer cells by activating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that lead to oxidative DNA damage, causing cancerous growth inhibition [ [106](#B106-molecules-26-02540)]. Apart from this, a practical study evaluating the effect of EGCG on mammary tumors showed that the administration of poly E resulted in slowing tumor progression, reductions in metastasis, inhibiting mammary ductal growth, and affecting angiogenesis by reducing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. VEGF is an influential angiogenic factor that allows for tumor proliferation and metastatic growth [ [107](#B107-molecules-26-02540)]. Additionally, EGCG has shown its potential in inhibiting hepatocellular carcinoma growth by inhibiting the proliferation of HepG2 and PC12, as well as inducing tumor cell apoptosis [ [108](#B108-molecules-26-02540)]. [109](#B109-molecules-26-02540)]. The inhibition of NF-B signaling increases cancer cells' vulnerability to radiotherapy; thus, curcumins' ability in inhibiting signaling pathways serves as one of its radiosensitizing activity. The administration of curcumin demonstrated the effects on T cell lymphoma, and the results indicate a decline in VEGF proteins resulting in angiogenesis inhibition [ [110](#B110-molecules-26-02540)]. In addition, the same study found that curcumin inhibits Glut1, thus resulting in decreased glucose uptake leading to induced apoptosis [ [110](#B110-molecules-26-02540)]. An in vitro study on breast cancer cells showed that curcumin decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis by targeting the PI3K signaling pathway [ [111](#B111-molecules-26-02540)]. Additionally, it has been found that curcumin up-regulates the expression of miR-99a, which consequently lead to deactivation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The previous processes exerted anti-tumor results such as inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, and induced apoptosis in retinoblastoma cells [ [112](#B112-molecules-26-02540)]. These examples explain curcumin's activity against tumor progression factors, which justify its chemopreventive effect. [113](#B113-molecules-26-02540)]. Furthermore, due to resveratrol's ability in reducing oxidative stress and upregulating the expression of survival proteins, it is used to reduce the cellular damage of chemotherapeutic agents [ [114](#B114-molecules-26-02540)]. A study conducted to assess the anti-cancer activity of resveratrol in melanoma determined that resveratrol downregulates NF-B expression, which in return inhibits the expression of miR-221. The subsequent inhibition process leads to reductions in metastasis and cancer cell proliferation [ [115](#B115-molecules-26-02540)]. Additionally, a study revealed that the administration of resveratrol at high concentrations together with long-term treatment led to the promotion of apoptosis and suppression of cancerous cell growth in human non-small cell lung cancer [ [116](#B116-molecules-26-02540)]. Overall, nutraceuticals and functional foods participate in cancer treatment as either chemopreventive or chemosensitizing agents. [Table 2](#molecules-26-02540-t002)summarizes anti-cancer modes of action. 3.2. Anti-Inflammatory Activity [136](#B136-molecules-26-02540)]. Another benefit of nutraceuticals as anti-inflammatory agents is that they can be used as a complementary alternative to anti-inflammatory therapeutic drugs, which leads to a reduction in drug dosage, and therefore reducing side effects [ [137](#B137-molecules-26-02540)]. Chronic inflammation is the major cause of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, diabetes, and cancer [ [136](#B136-molecules-26-02540)]. [138](#B138-molecules-26-02540)]. Curcumin can act as an anti-inflammatory agent which can help in the prevention and treatment of periodontitis [ [139](#B139-molecules-26-02540)]. Curcumin can reduce inflammation in patients suffering from chronic cutaneous complications and improve patient's condition suffered from chronic pruritis caused by a chemical sulfur mustard by reducing IL-8 and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) [ [140](#B140-molecules-26-02540)]. [141](#B141-molecules-26-02540)]. Treatment with PUFA reduced the expression of NF-B. In addition, a reduction in proinflammatory markers and an increase in IL-10 anti-inflammatory marker was observed in patients suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy [ [142](#B142-molecules-26-02540)]. Another example of a nutraceutical component is lycopene, which is an anti-inflammatory molecule found in tomatoes that can protect the heart and prevent cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and myocarditis [ [143](#B143-molecules-26-02540), [144](#B144-molecules-26-02540)]. A meta-analysis conducted to evaluate the association between lycopene and cardiovascular disease (CVD) showed a reduction in CVD risk by 17% [ [145](#B145-molecules-26-02540)]. [146](#B146-molecules-26-02540)]. For instance, and Bifidobacterium reducing proinflammatory cytokine production [ [147](#B147-molecules-26-02540)]. Additionally, prebiotics have also been suggested to express anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions [ [148](#B148-molecules-26-02540)]. Pretreatment with -(1,3)-glucan prevented clinical manifestations of dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammatory bowel disease and inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mice [ [149](#B149-molecules-26-02540)]. [150](#B150-molecules-26-02540)]. In a study, orally administered ginger to newborn rats with necrotizing enterocolitis showed a reduction in TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6, which indicated a significant reduction in the inflammation [ [150](#B150-molecules-26-02540)], as well as inhibiting the acute inflammatory response in ulcerative colitis [ [151](#B151-molecules-26-02540)]. Furthermore, cinnamon extracts were able to inhibit more than 90% of the expression of IL-1 at the concentration of 50 g/mL, and peppermint extracts were capable of reducing 90% of the expression of IL-6 at the concentration of 50 g/mL; both indicated potent levels of anti-inflammatory activity [ [152](#B152-molecules-26-02540)]. [Table 3](#molecules-26-02540-t003)summarizes anti-inflammatory [164](#B164-molecules-26-02540)]. Normally, redox (reduction and oxidation) balance of the cell maintains the generation and the removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ [165](#B165-molecules-26-02540)]. However, an imbalance in redox will result in the accumulation of ROS and reducing antioxidant ability to neutralize ROS effects, which subsequently induces oxidative stress [ [166](#B166-molecules-26-02540), [167](#B167-molecules-26-02540)]. [168](#B168-molecules-26-02540)]. Free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion radicals can be scavenged by vitamin C [ [168](#B168-molecules-26-02540)]. Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant that protects cells and DNA from oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals [ [169](#B169-molecules-26-02540)]. Vitamin E and vitamin C are capable of protecting cells from lipid peroxidation [ [170](#B170-molecules-26-02540)]. [171](#B171-molecules-26-02540)]. Ginger extract showed an increase in the antioxidant enzyme and a reduction in the oxidative stress in blood [ [172](#B172-molecules-26-02540)]. [173](#B173-molecules-26-02540)]. Beetroot contains betalain and phenolic compounds which cause an increase in the resistance of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) to oxidation [ [174](#B174-molecules-26-02540)], protect the liver from damage [ [175](#B175-molecules-26-02540)], and decrease blood pressure [ [176](#B176-molecules-26-02540)]. Dried fruits are a good source of antioxidants and have health benefits to humans. They can reduce glucose levels in the blood in addition to reducing risk factors associated with heart disease [ [177](#B177-molecules-26-02540)]. [178](#B178-molecules-26-02540)]. Nuts such as pistachios are a rich source of antioxidants [ [179](#B179-molecules-26-02540)] which can reduce oxidative stress and prevent or lower the risk of chronic diseases [ [180](#B180-molecules-26-02540)]. Pistachios and other nuts such as walnuts and pecans contain polyphenolic compounds which act as antioxidants [ [181](#B181-molecules-26-02540)] that might protect against diseases associated with the accumulation of free radicals [ [180](#B180-molecules-26-02540)]. 3.4. Anti-Lipid Activity [88](#B88-molecules-26-02540), [182](#B182-molecules-26-02540), [183](#B183-molecules-26-02540)]. Hypercholesterolemia is a term used to describe the presence of excessive low-density lipoproteins in blood [ [184](#B184-molecules-26-02540)]. The effects of nutraceuticals on lowering lipid profiles in hypercholesterolemic patients have been investigated; therefore, this section will discuss nutraceuticals' activity on multiple conditions associated with elevated lipid levels. The application of nutraceuticals as hypolipidemic agents has shown great potential in lowering total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations. Lipid-lowering nutraceuticals can be classified into three groups based on their mechanism of action. Such mechanisms include the inhibition of cholesterol absorption, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, and excretion of LDL [ [185](#B185-molecules-26-02540)]. [186](#B186-molecules-26-02540)]. It has been found that the intake of plant sterols demonstrated an effect on lipid profiles by lowering the concentrations of triglycerides and LDL in individuals at risk or suffering from type-2 diabetes mellitus [ [187](#B187-molecules-26-02540)]. A study examining the effectiveness of plant sterol-enriched yogurt has demonstrated a modified lipid profile resulting in reduced TC and LDL concentrations [ [188](#B188-molecules-26-02540)]. Moreover, the additive effect of plant sterols with lipid-lowering therapies have been investigated, and it has been determined that the addition of plant sterols to atorvastatin or ezetimibe resulted in further reductions in total and low density cholesterol [ [189](#B189-molecules-26-02540)]. [190](#B190-molecules-26-02540), [191](#B191-molecules-26-02540), [192](#B192-molecules-26-02540)]. A study was conducted to assess a group of nutraceuticals on their lipid modifying ability; the nutraceuticals of berberine, RYR and monacolin K, policosanol, and folic acid. The results demonstrated that RYR significantly lowered TC and LDL [ [183](#B183-molecules-26-02540)]. The combination of fermented red rice, liposomal berberine, and curcumin showed great results in improving lipid profiles and reducing inflammatory markers in individuals suffering from hypercholesterolemia [ [193](#B193-molecules-26-02540)]. RYR possess many functional components, although monacolin K may be a major contributor to its effectiveness. Monacolin K mechanism of action lies in decreasing hepatic cholesterol synthesis and inhibiting cholesterol absorption [ [194](#B194-molecules-26-02540)]. [195](#B195-molecules-26-02540)]. [196](#B196-molecules-26-02540)]. Similarly, curcumin is also considered a hypolipidemic agent that reduces TC, LDL and triglycerides, which is explained by increased cholesterol excretion [ [197](#B197-molecules-26-02540)]. 4. Nutraceuticals' Safety on Consumers [185](#B185-molecules-26-02540)]. However, misuse and overuse of these products may pose health risks to humans. The safety of these nutraceuticals on consumers basically depends on the type, time, and the quantity used. Use of some nutraceuticals, especially when one is under medication, can result in interactions between the drug and the nutraceutical compounds causing very harmful effects on the body [ [198](#B198-molecules-26-02540)]. Thus, for safe usage, they should be used only when prescribed by qualified personnel at the right quantity, the correct quality, and timing. [199](#B199-molecules-26-02540)]. Despite a broad safety profile, few of them are reported to have been compromised due to contamination with heavy metals, toxic pesticides, drugs having potentials for abuse, potentially toxic plants, fertilizers, and mycotoxins [ [200](#B200-molecules-26-02540), [201](#B201-molecules-26-02540)]. Unfortunately, the safety profile of a large number of nutraceuticals is yet to be explored, and thus insufficient safety data are available for these agents. Understanding of the pharmacokinetic behavior of every drug is extremely important for the understanding of safety profile (toxico-kinetics), onset of action, required dose, and dose frequency. Furthermore, interactions with other drugs as well as nutrients/foods are another vital aspect of safety evaluations of nutraceuticals that assess the effect of interactions on safety, efficacy, half-life and subsequent therapeutic response [ [198](#B198-molecules-26-02540)]. [202](#B202-molecules-26-02540)]. All of the above factors, in addition to the unavailability of well-established techniques for extraction, identification, chemical composition, purity, potency, and safety of active pharmaceutical ingredients are the limiting factors of nutraceuticals, responsible for batch to batch variation and the un-reproducibility of therapeutic responses [ [203](#B203-molecules-26-02540)]. Furthermore, nutraceuticals comprise numerous compounds which can act synergistically as well as mediate an antagonistic response. Both of these effects may range from high therapeutic outcomes to toxicity and possibly a sub-therapeutic response [ [204](#B204-molecules-26-02540)]. 4.1. [208](#B208-molecules-26-02540)]. Aloe vera gel has been generally found to be less genotoxic and less mutagenic as compared to whole leaf extracts [ [209](#B209-molecules-26-02540)], and in agreement, it was unable to induce significant mutagenic effects in S. typhimurium TA100 strain [ [210](#B210-molecules-26-02540)]. However, a positive mutagenic response was observed when an E. coli repair-deficient mutant was treated with A. vera pulp extract [ [211](#B211-molecules-26-02540)]. Danthron, an aloe constituent, is reported to initiate DNA damage and cause caspase-induced apoptosis via Bax-elicited and mitochondrial permeability transition gastric cancer cells [ [212](#B212-molecules-26-02540)]. [213](#B213-molecules-26-02540)]. Several in-vitro studies using cell lines demonstrated G. biloba as well as its isolated components including quercetin, kaempferol-induced cytotoxicity, and mutagenicity [ [214](#B214-molecules-26-02540)]. However, no genotoxicity was experienced in androstane receptor knockout and gpt delta mice following oral administration of 2000 mg/kg G. biloba extract [ [215](#B215-molecules-26-02540), [216](#B216-molecules-26-02540)]. Therefore, testing against typhimurium (TA98, TA100 strains) E. coli 1-10 mg/plate not mutagenic, carcinoma/adenoma were observed in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice orally supplemented with the same nutraceutical for two years. However, when supplementation was performed only for three months, increases in micro-nucleated erythrocyte frequencies were not significant [ [217](#B217-molecules-26-02540)]. In vitro studies on HepG2 cells using commercial goldenseal products suggested that it damages DNA, indicated by the induction of gamma-H2AX, which is a biomarker of DNA damage and breaks [ [218](#B218-molecules-26-02540)]. 4.2. Models to Evaluate Safety, Efficacy, and Potential Toxicities of Nutraceuticals [219](#B219-molecules-26-02540), [220](#B220-molecules-26-02540), [221](#B221-molecules-26-02540), [222](#B222-molecules-26-02540), [223](#B223-molecules-26-02540)]. Subsequently, these products were applied and their efficiency appraised using in vitro, in vivo, in silico, high-throughput in vitro, and omics technology-reliant assays [ [224](#B224-molecules-26-02540)]. Furthermore, various animal models have been used for in vivo, invasive, and non-invasive studies depending upon study design [ [225](#B225-molecules-26-02540)]. Some invertebrate models have been developed for safety and efficacy evaluations of nutraceuticals [ [226](#B226-molecules-26-02540), [227](#B227-molecules-26-02540)]. Currently, some alternative safety evaluation models are more preferred [ [228](#B228-molecules-26-02540)]. Novel and mechanism-based predictive kinetic models have also been developed, which provide very useful information regarding pathways involved in toxicity and efficacy [ [229](#B229-molecules-26-02540), [230](#B230-molecules-26-02540)]. 4.3. Toxicities Based on Interactions of Nutraceuticals with Other Drugs [231](#B231-molecules-26-02540)]. Several factors including age, simultaneously administered drugs, and multiple co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and infectious diseases contribute to these unwanted interactions and pre-dispose patients to the side effects of nutraceuticals. Of particular importance are drugs with a low therapeutic index such as digitalis glycosides, anticoagulant drugs, chemotherapeutics, psychoactive agents, and immune-modulators which can lead to life threatening reactions if their concentrations rise beyond the safety range due to interactions [ [231](#B231-molecules-26-02540)]. Some nutraceuticals are inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYTP450) iso-enzymes, and thus induce or inhibit liver enzymes responsible for the metabolism of these drugs [ [232](#B232-molecules-26-02540), [233](#B233-molecules-26-02540), [234](#B234-molecules-26-02540)]. For instance, several phytochemicals present in G. biloba are inducers as well as inhibitors of CYP450 [ [235](#B235-molecules-26-02540), [236](#B236-molecules-26-02540)]. Ginseng is an inducer of CYP450, whereas grapefruit juice is an inhibitor of it. Likewise, peppermint oil is a well-studied inducer several [ St. John's wort and its constituents inhibit CYP3A4-induced metabolism of testosterone and midazolam. Studies revealed that several fold increases in the metabolic activity of hepatic CYP3A2 were observed fourteen days subsequently of St. John's wort administration [ [238](#B238-molecules-26-02540), [239](#B239-molecules-26-02540)]. Moreover, ginseng, an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins type efflux pumps, causes a 3-4-fold increase in the activity of several drugs [ [238](#B238-molecules-26-02540)]. St. John's wort administration has major effects on the kinetics and dynamics of several drugs, especially when poly-pharmacy is involved [ [240](#B240-molecules-26-02540), [241](#B241-molecules-26-02540)]. Most types of drug may affect nutriture, directly or indirectly, whereas nutriture affects drug disposition and subsequent therapeutic responses. 4.4. Contaminants Compromising the Quality of Nutraceuticals [242](#B242-molecules-26-02540)]. For instance, pyrrolizidine alkaloids are among the most toxic alkaloids present in several plant species. These alkaloids contaminate several foods and nutraceuticals and react with proteins causing abnormal mitosis, tissue necrosis, and cellular dysfunctions [ [243](#B243-molecules-26-02540), [244](#B244-molecules-26-02540), [245](#B245-molecules-26-02540)]. These are hepatotoxic and have carcinogenic and cytotoxic potentials [ [242](#B242-molecules-26-02540)]. [246](#B246-molecules-26-02540)]. For example, a Polish study showed that from 152 products and samples tested, 92.1% and 86.8% exhibited different degrees of bacterial and fungal contamination, respectively [ [246](#B246-molecules-26-02540)]. [247](#B247-molecules-26-02540), [248](#B248-molecules-26-02540)]. Likewise, heavy metals including mercury, arsenic, cadmium and lead are contaminates added during harvesting or storage; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends to evaluate all herbal products for heavy metal contents due to their severe side effects [ [249](#B249-molecules-26-02540)]. Similarly, widespread use of pesticides causes accumulation in the products and causes toxicity [ [250](#B250-molecules-26-02540)]. 4.5. Regulatory Status of Nutraceuticals [16](#B16-molecules-26-02540), [251](#B251-molecules-26-02540)]. Proper regulatory recognition of these products will excel the pharmaceutical industry with many new products and subsequent expansion of its market. A majority of countries have not adopted specific regulatory guidelines for nutraceuticals, which could possibly cause flooding of the healthcare sector with low-quality products, especially in developing countries. Thus, there is a dire need for the global health community to prepare regulatory guidelines for nutraceuticals to protect the market from the entry of spurious and low-quality drugs. Furthermore, rigorous scientific research is necessary both in the field of functional foods and nutraceuticals to uncover their exact mechanisms of action as well as potential adverse effects. 4.6. Effects of Processing on Nutraceuticals [252](#B252-molecules-26-02540)]. These treatments activate the biosynthesis of nutraceuticals in crops by a similar mechanism exerted by wound stress. Another study has shown that ultrasound treatment increases the levels of carotenoids in carrots [ [253](#B253-molecules-26-02540)]. Furthermore, the same treatment enhanced phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity (PAL) and phenolic compounds in Panax ginseng [ [254](#B254-molecules-26-02540)], while phenolic compounds were increased in romaine lettuce [ [255](#B255-molecules-26-02540)]. A different study has shown that HHP increased ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds, and carotenoids in ataulfo mango [ [256](#B256-molecules-26-02540)]. Additionally, potato metabolism showed PEF-specific responses characterized by changes in the hexose pool, which may result in starch and ascorbic acid degradation [ [257](#B257-molecules-26-02540)]. The inadvertent production of metabolites may further enhance the exerted health benefits of such foods compared to foods which are consumed directly post-harvest. However, this is an area that is still under research, and the perceived benefits in the long term to human health are very much unexplored. 5. Current Trends and Future Prospects of Nutraceuticals [258](#B258-molecules-26-02540)]. The marked side effects and ineffectiveness of modern pharmaceuticals have compelled people to look for nutraceuticals as alternative therapy [ [259](#B259-molecules-26-02540)]. Nutraceuticals for a medicinal use have been justified on the basis that they treat disease caused by the deficiency of nutrients. Clear evidence has been reported that nutraceutical supplementation improves health and prevents diseases [ [260](#B260-molecules-26-02540)]. The treatment through nutraceutical supplementation does not involve diagnosis by a trained practitioner, and nutraceuticals with antioxidant activity are expected to have beneficial effects on the whole body rather than to treat symptoms of a disease state. Consumers of nutraceuticals control their health comfortably without needing consultation with their physicians. [261](#B261-molecules-26-02540)]. This is due to glorification of the benefits of nutraceuticals via advertising and media coverage. Health professionals such as general physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and nutritionist are well aware of nutraceuticals, and educate their patients or consumers about the appropriate use of such products. Self-medication of nutraceuticals for serious diseases is inappropriate, while their long-term use is safe and beneficial for the prevention of chronic diseases. Nutraceuticals for serious diseases involve carnitine and flaxseed oil mostly used for cardiovascular disease, and antioxidants mostly for the prevention of cancer. Currently, many nutraceutical consumers believe that dietary supplements may be safer than other synthetic substances, but their presumption could be wrong and medical diagnosis is required for serious disease to prescribe effective conventional medicines. It has been reported that self-medication with complementary medicine has increased in diabetic patients [ [262](#B262-molecules-26-02540), [263](#B263-molecules-26-02540)]. [264](#B264-molecules-26-02540)]. [265](#B265-molecules-26-02540)]. In October 1998, Dean Farms, Tring and Hertfordshire introduced \"Columbus healthier eggs\" which were rich in fatty acid and available in all major supermarkets [ [266](#B266-molecules-26-02540)]. Similarly, burgeon bread is another example of function food, which was introduced by Allied Bakeries in September 1997. This bread contains soya and flaxseed and is rich in natural plant estrogen and is used to treat menopausal symptoms [ [266](#B266-molecules-26-02540), [267](#B267-molecules-26-02540), [268](#B268-molecules-26-02540)]. 6.
