Sacred Cacao & Sound Healing Ceremony hosted by Candace Blair September 23, 2023 2PM Eastern USA Time We invite you to a unique Fall Equinox, Sacred Cacao and Sound Healing Ceremony hosted by Keith's' Cacao Practitioner, Candace Blair. As a group, we will drink a ceremonial dose of Keith's Cacao as Candace guides us to connect with this divine-feminine spirit and ancient wisdom of this gentle and euphoric plant medicine. We will tap into the balance of polarities afforded by Equinox energies; as daylight and night find a balance outside, we will seek equanimity within. Through gratitude for the seeds planted and the rewards reaped in our Fall harvest, we will examine what we learned, what we wish to take forward, and how we intend to show up in our truth and love.

Candace is an experienced sound healer trained in the gong, crystal & alchemy singing bowls. She is a Keith's Cacao Practitioner. She attended her first Cacao ceremony in 2012 and has been hosting her sacred ceremonies since 2017. Her ceremonies are designed for transformation using a combination of guided meditation, shamanic journeying, and sound healing to shift negative energy, shake old stories, and help you reclaim your power, stepping into your truth and vibrating at your highest frequency. Each ceremony is unique & guided by the Spirit of Cacao. Additionally, Candace received her KRI Kundalini Certification with the Karam Kriya School in England & Portugal and has taught Kundalini Yoga & Meditation for over ten years. She is trained in shamanic reiki levels 1 & 2 and is the lead North American coach for the \"Alchemy of Becoming\" methodology. She worked abroad, as an investment banker for 23 years before returning to the USA in 2017 to focus full-time on sharing her passion for Kundalini Yoga, Meditation, Sound Healing, Cacao Ceremonies, and community work through her company, Soul Fire Social. Based on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, she spends her summers traveling the USA & Europe, sharing these ancient practices. Her motto? Together, We Rise! Sound Healing is a potent tool for connecting to self and releasing energies that may hold us back from our goals and passions. We are all, essentially, frequencies. Everything around us is a collection of molecules vibrating at different rates. Given this fact, a sound healing session can help us connect with our body's energy and identify out-of-balance frequencies. By focusing on different parts of our bodies with personal intent, we can also use the power of sound to clear away blockages and allow our energy to flow freely. "}
