Should a student register for the exam an d not take it on the assigned date, the cost of the exam will be forfeited. That student will not be considered for selection. When exam results are received and fall semester grades have been posted, faculty will begin the selection process using a point system that considers course grades, state of residency, number of core courses that have been completed and pre - entrance exam scores. Students will be notified by letter that they are accepted or not accepted. Students who are not accepted will have the o pportunity to be considered for the next year's class, but have to indicate this on a form to be submitted to the nursing office. They will have an opportunity to retest the following year, if they so desire or they may keep their current scores. HESI scores will only be valid for three years. Students who retest must pay another exam fee. Once students are selected for admission to the ADN program, they must attend a mandatory orientation session.

Student Code of Conduct Academic institutions exist for the transmission of knowledge, the pursuit of truth, the development of students, and the wellbeing of society. Free inquiry and free expression are indispensable to the attainment of these goals. As members of this academic community, students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for knowledge. Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic conditions in the classroom, on th e campus, other college sites, and in the community. Students are expected to exercise their freedom with responsibility. As members of the academic community, students are subject to the obligations which accrue to them by virtue of this membership. As me mbers of the larger community of which the college is a part, students are entitled to all rights and protection accorded them by the laws of the community. By the same token, students are also subject to all laws, the enforcement of which is the responsib ility of duly constituted authorities. When students violate laws, they may incur penalties prescribed by legal authorities. In such instances, college discipline will be initiated if the presence of the student on campus is considered a possible threat to persons or property, or if that person's presence may disrupt the educational process of the college. However, when a student's violation of the law also adversely affects the college's recognized educational objectives, or violates the college's Student Code of Conduct, the college will enforce its own regulations. When students violate college regulations, they are subject to disciplinary action by the college whether or not their conduct violates the law. It is the policy of the Technical College System of Georgia to provide technical and adult education programs for the people of Georgia. Technical Colleges must provide opportunities for intellectual, emotional, social, and physical growth. Technical College students assume an obligation to act in a manner compatible with the fulfillment of the mission. The Technical College community recognizes its responsibility to provide an atmosphere conducive to growth. With these principles in mind, the Technical College System of Georgia establishes a Student Cod e of Conduct. The Student Code Of Conduct can be found in the Student Handbook at http://gntc.smartcatalogiq.com/2020 -2021/Student -Handbook/Student -Rights -and- Responsibilities/Student -Code-of-Conduct. Student Disciplinary Policy and Procedure The college administration reserves the right to maintain a safe and orderly educational environment for Students and staff. Therefore, when, in the judgment of Technical College officials, a Student's conduct disrupts or threatens to disrupt the Technical College Community, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken to restore and protect the atmosphere of collegiality and mutual respect on GENERAL COLLEGE INFO RMATION AND POLICIES | 375 campus. This procedure is intended to provide an orderly protocol for handlin g Student disciplinary cases in accordance with the principles of due process and justice. Student Disciplinary Policy and Procedure can be found in the Student Handbook at http://gntc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2018 -2019/Student -Handbook.

Reporting and Management Action 1. All students are encouraged to report incidents of sex discrimination and sexual misconduct against themselves or others to the Title IX Coordinator at the technical college. The Title IX regulations define \"sexual harassment\" to include three types of misconduct on the basis of sex which jeopardize the equal access to education that Title IX is designed to protect. These types of misconduct include: any instance of quid pro quo harassment by a TCSG an d/or College employee; any conduct on the basis of sex that in the view of a reasonable person is so severe and pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to a TCSG and/or College education program or activity; and any instance of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking (collectively \"Title IX Prohibited Conduct,\" as defined in this Procedure). Students may find contact information for the Title IX Coordinator on the technical college websit e, and in the student handbook and college catalog. Complaints may also be emailed to unlawfulharassment@tcsg.edu. 2. To utilize this procedure, a Complainant must file a Formal Complaint which is defined herein as a document filed and signed by a Compl ainant or filed and signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging Title IX Prohibited Conduct against a Respondent and requesting that TCSG investigate the allegations. 3. Any allegation of sex discrimination, sexual misconduct or retaliation against employe es must be reported to the Human Resources Director and the Title IX Coordinator. 4. All allegations of sex discrimination and sexual misconduct on one of TCSG's college campuses or clinical locations must be reported to the Title IX Coordinator regardless of whether the allegations involve students or employees. All students, faculty, st aff, and others participating in TCSG and/or College programs and activities in the United States are subject to this Title IX Procedure. If the allegations do not fall within the jurisdiction under this procedure, they may be referred and processed under the student code of conduct procedure. 5. Students have the right to file (or not to file) a criminal complaint for sexual violence with the local law enforcement authorities before, during, or after filing a complaint with the college. The investigation under this procedure shall not be unreasonably delayed to await the outcome of any criminal investigation. Sexual violence reports made to the Title IX Coordinator will be investigated and adjudicated separately from any criminal complaints. A student m ay request that the Title IX Coordinator and/or the Investigator assist the student with notifying local law enforcement authorities. If a technical college's campus law enforcement receives a complaint alleging sexual harassment and/or sexual misconduct as defined in this procedure, the Title IX Coordinator for the college shall be immediately notified so that appropriate action may be taken by the Title IX Coordinator regarding the complaint. 6. If a student filing a complaint alleging sexual misconduct requests confidentiality, anonymity or asks that the complaint not be pursued, the college must inform the complainant that its ability to respond may be limited, that retaliation for filing a complaint is prohibited, and that steps to GENERAL COLLEGE INFO RMATION AND POLICIES | 383 prevent harassment and retaliation will be taken. Consistent with the request, all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint should be made and other steps to limit the effects or recurrence of the alleged misconduct will be taken. --Regardless of a stude nt's request for confidentiality, anonymity of a complaint, or a request that a complaint not be pursued, if the complaint includes allegations of sexual assault, sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking, the Title IX Coordinator mu st report the incident to campus law enforcement for inclusion in the college's Annual Security Report (\"ASR\"). The complainant should be informed that their name will not be disclosed to campus law enforcement if they have requested confidentiality durin g the processing of the complaint. 7. Colleges may weigh a request for confidentiality, anonymity or a request they not pursue a complaint considering the following factors: the seriousness of the alleged conduct, the complainant's age, and the respondent 's right to receive information about the allegations if the information is maintained as an \"education record\" under FERPA. The college must inform the complainant if the request cannot be granted and the reasons for the denial. 8. Reports concerning all prohibited conduct referenced in this procedure will be processed confidentially to the extent permitted by law; communications regarding complaints will be disseminated to others on a need -to-know basis to ensure that necessary steps are taken to protect the community as a whole and that appropriate corrective actions are considered and taken. 9. If an allegation of sex discrimination or sexual misconduct is made to an employee not designated to receive such reports, the employee receiving the complaint mu st report the allegation to the Title IX Coordinator. The College must take corrective actions to stop harassment to which it has notice, prevent recurrence of the harassment, and remedy the effects on the complainant promptly and effectively. The Colle ge will be deemed to have notice if a responsible employee knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, about the harassment. A responsible employee includes any employee who has the authority to take action to redress the harassment, wh o has a duty to report the harassment to the Title IX Coordinator, or who a student could reasonably believe has this authority or responsibility, including instructors and staff at the college. 10. Allegations of any sexual conduct involving individuals u nder the age of 18 must also be reported as an allegation of child abuse as outlined in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 19 -7-5. 11. Supportive measures must be offered to the complainant by the college president or the Title IX Coordinator or his/her designee before the final outcome of an investigation and until final resolution of the allegations if failure to take the interim measures would constitute an immediate threat to the safety and well -being of the complainant, the respondent, or other members of the college, or to e nsure equal access to the college's programs and activities. Supportive measures may include: adjustments to academic workload (including extending deadlines); adjustment to class or work schedules; no contact orders; and suspensions, transfers or reassig nments in order to prevent further harassment, discrimination, sexual violence or retaliation, to facilitate the investigation, or to implement preventive or corrective actions under this procedure; informal resolutions or discretionary dismissals 12. Discretionary Dismissal. 1. TCSG and/or the College may dismiss the Formal Complaint if:the Respondent is no longer enrolled or employed by TCSG and/or the College; specific circumstances prevent TCSG and/or the College from gathering sufficient evidence to reach a determination; or the Complainant informs the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the Complainant desires to withdraw the Formal Complaint or allegations therein. 2. A Complainant may notify the Title IX Coordinator at any time that the Complainan t does not wish to proceed with the Investigation and/or Hearing process. If such a request is received,the 384| GEORGIA NORTHWESTE RN TECHNICAL COLLEGE 2020 -2021 CATALOG Title IX Coordinator will inform the Complainant that the TCSG and/or the College's ability to respond to the allegation may be limited if the alle gations are withdrawn. 3. The Title IX Coordinator will consider the relevant factors in reaching a determination as to whether to terminate the Investigation and/or Hearing process. In the event that the Title IX Coordinator determines that the Investiga tion will continue, the Title IX Coordinator will notify the Complainant of that determination.

Regular admission of transfer students is contingent upon his or her meeting all the regular admission requirements and being in good standing at a regionally a ccredited diploma or degree granting institution. Provisional Status: Students who do not meet all requirements for regular admission into a selected program are granted provisional admission status. Provisionally admitted students may take learning supp ort classes and certain specified occupational courses as long as class pre - and co - requisites are satisfied.

Placement Test The purpose of placement testing is to ensure that a student has the academic skills necessary to succeed in the chosen program of study. Minimum test score requirements are established based on statewide standards. Applicants for all degree, diploma, and selected certificate programs must take the COMPASS, ASSET, or ACCUPLACER placement exam unless they can p rovide exemption documentation. (See Exemption from Placement Testing (p. 401).) Students who do not meet the minimum score req uirements upon initial testing may request to retest on each part of the test in an attempt to meet the necessary requirements. After the approved retest, students will be allowed to retest one time the following academic year for up to three academic yea rs. Exceptions to this retest policy may be made on a case -by-base basis for students enrolling in the Basic Law Enforcement program. Students must pay the published retesting fee*. Failure to achieve scores at program level requirements in one or more subjects will require taking learning support classes in the deficient areas. A link to a list of test preparation websites is available on the GNTC website under the \"Admissions\" tab on the \"Testing Center\" page. Reasonable accommodations are made during testing for those who have a documented need. The examinee should meet with the campus Accessibility Services Coordinator and provide documentation supporting the request for accommodation. The coordinator will notify the director of the testing center o f the approved accommodations. The examinee should make an appointment for testing with the testing center when paperwork is completed. *Students participating in dual enrollment are excluded from the retest fee. Exemption from Placement Testing Applicants providing official documentation of acceptable ASSET, COMPASS, ACCUPLACER, ACT or SAT scores, or official documentation of a course grade of \"C\" or better in credit -level English and mathematics taken fr om an accredited college or postsecondary institution, may be exempt from testing. Time Limitation for Program Completion Georgia Northwestern Technical College will accept course credits from regionally and n ationally accredited institutions of higher education without time constraints, except in some health programs. The institution does not limit the amount of time it will honor coursework taken at the college, except in some health programs. However, at the discretion of a student's advisor, students may be required to repeat coursework where the course content has changed significantly. There is no minimum amount of time in which a program of study must be completed. The typical minimum program length is li sted in the Curriculum section of this catalog. A student must take 25 percent of his or her program at Georgia Northwestern Technical College; however, the 25 percent requirement 402| GEORGIA NORTHWESTE RN TECHNICAL COLLEGE 2020 -2021 CATALOG will be waived if the student completed a program for which standards have b een implemented within the Technical College System of Georgia. High School Initiatives High School Initiatives allow qualified students to maximize their education and training time by beginning college while they are still in high school. Qualified students may earn credit at the college only, or they may earn credit concurrently at both the college and high school. The New Move On When Ready (MOWR) Programs formerly known as ACCEL, Dual Enrollment, and the \"old\" Move On When Ready are now consolidated into one program called Move On When Ready (MOWR). The new MOWR allows high school students to take academic degree level core courses that will transfer to any TCSG or USG college or university as well as occupational courses and diploma level core courses. Some students may choose to just take a few courses while others may choose to take their full course load with the college. All college coursework taken through MOWR will be fully covered through MOWR funding, and students will not be required to pay out of pocket for tuition, college fees, or textbooks. The only fees students may be responsible for are course -specific fees determined by the college. No hours taken through the new M OWR program will count toward a student's HOPE Grant or Scholarship caps. Participating in the new MOWR program is a great incentive for high school students to get ahead on their college coursework! Eligibility for MOWR Any 9th - 12th grade students in an eligible Georgia high school or home study program who has achieved required scores on the college placement exam, is eligible to take part in the program. There are NO residency or citizenship requirements. Students c an enroll in GNTC courses during Fall, Spring, or Summer semesters while still in high school and receive concurrent credit. Students must complete the MOWR funding application through www.gafutures.org. Tuition, Fees, and Books Tuition and most fees are covered by MOWR for every eligible student in the program through a separate funding source. Because MOWR students are now eligible to participate in almost all GNTC programs, they may be respon sible for course specific fees in some program areas; however, most GNTC programs do not require such fees. Students should speak to the High School Initiatives staff to find out specifics about course -related fees. Books will be provided to MOWR student s at no charge to the students. Joint Enrollment Joint Enrollment provides high school students the opportunity to take courses at Georgia Northwestern Technical College and receive college credit ONLY for the courses that they tak e at the college. Jointly enrolled students are offered the same status on the Georgia Northwestern Technical College campus as any other student, including eligibility for academic honors and participation in student activities. Joint Enrollment is fund ed through the HOPE Grant for Georgia residents. GNTC will exempt the remainder of the tuition and fees not paid by HOPE.

Grants and Scholarships do not have to be repaid unless received erroneously. Refer to the GNTC website (www.gntc.edu) for more information. To be eligible for most financial assistance, a student must have a high school diploma or equivalent (GED). Students must be accepted into a degree, diploma, or certificate program at the college to be eligible for assistance. The Free Application for Federal Student Assistance (FAFSA) must be completed each academic yea r to be considered for any assistance. Other means of applying for financial assistance may be available by contacting the Financial Assistance Office. The financial aid academic year begins Fall term and the FAFSA applications are available in January. To apply for all assistance, a student may complete the FAFSA online at www.fafsa.gov. There is a link to the website on the GNTC website, www.gntc.edu. Please check with the Financial Aid Office for more details on the application process. All students must have a complete file for awarding of financial assistance; therefore, students should allow themselves 4 -6 weeks prior to the start of a term to complete the process. After students complete all other required paperwork, they will receive award notificati on letters via their student email account, showing the types and amounts of assistance for which they qualify. The Financial Aid Office uses the student email system to notify students of their financial assistance status. The Business Office will disburs e funds to those who qualify. Academic Policies for Financial Aid Federal and state regulations require the college to establish policies to measure whether students applying for financial aid are in good academi c standing and making satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their degrees, diplomas, or certificate programs. Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy 412| GEORGIA NORTHWESTE RN TECHNICAL COLLEGE 2020 -2021 CATALOG A student is required to maintain satisfactory academic progress to remain eligible for financial aid. Georgia Northwestern Technical College uses the following standards to monitor a student's progress toward his or her diploma, degree, or certificate. Satisfacto ry progress is measured in terms of three components: length of time to complete the program (150%) a qualitative component (2.0 GPA) a quantitative component (completion of attempted credit hours, 66.67%) Maximum Timeframe There are a maximum number of hours that students may attempt in pursuing their current program of study. Students may not exceed 150% of the hours needed to complete the program of study they are currently enrolled in, excluding Learning Support courses. This does include transfer coursework that has been accepted as credit toward the student's current program of study. Once a student has attempted 150% of the minimum number of credit hours necessary for completing the program requirements, the student will not be eligible to receive financial aid. Qualitative (Grade Point Average) Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 to remain in good standing. Financial aid GPA's will be monitored at the end of each term. A student whose cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 is placed on Financial Aid Warning for their next term of enrollment. This will allow a student one term to increase the GPA to the satisfactory level. If, after one term, the GPA remains below 2.0, the stu dent will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension and eligibility will be lost until the cumulative GPA has been brought back to at least a 2.0 level. Students may receive aid while on Financial Aid Warning, but will not receive aid while on Financial Aid S uspension. Transfer coursework and Learning Support courses are not counted in the cumulative GPA calculation. Quantitative (Completion Rate) In order for students to graduate within the maximum \"time frame\" of hours, at the end of each term they are expected to have cumulatively completed at least 66.67% of their credit hours attempted. A student, who, at the end of any term, has not successfully completed 66.67% of their cumulative hours attempted, will be placed on Financial Aid Warning for their n ext term of enrollment. This will allow the student one term to increase the cumulative completion rate to the satisfactory level. If, after one term, the cumulative completion rate remains below 66.67% the student will be placed on Financial Aid Suspens ion and eligibility will be lost until the cumulative completion rate has been brought back to at least 66.67%. Students may receive aid while on Financial Aid Warning but the student will not receive aid while on Financial Aid Suspension. Students may re-establish good standing when they have cumulatively completed 66.67% of their attempted credit hours. The following grades (see Grading System) do not count toward successfully completing a course: \"F\", \"I\", \"W\", \"WF\", \"WP\", and \"IP\". For all courses, any combination of these results in no progress, and will be calculated in the completion rate when computing eligibility for financial aid. Repeat courses will be considered as any other class and both grades will count in the GPA. Grades of \"F\" and \"WF \" will be counted in computing your GPA. FINAN CIAL INFORMATION | 413 Learning Support courses are graded on an A* through F* scale. A grade of A*, B*, or C* will be considered satisfactory completion of a learning support course. A grade of D* or F* will be considered unsatisfact ory. Grades received for learning support courses are included in the 66.67% hours attempted completion rate, but not in the GPA calculation. Example: A student completes his first year at GNTC with the following grades: 30 cumulative attempted credi ts with 18 credits of passing grades (these credits count as attempted and completed) 12 credits of failing grades (these credits count as attempted but not completed) The student's completion rate is 60.00% (total completed divided by total attempted - 18/30 = 60.00%) The student in this example did not meet the quantitative (completion rate) SAP standard and is at risk of losing financial aid. If the student had completed 21 credits with passing grades they would have met the quantitative SAP standa rd. (21/30 = 70.00%) Note: GNTC truncates and does not round the calculations for the qualitative and quantitative SAP components. Please see the below examples. Quantitative Example: A cumulative completion rate of 66.66666666% is not rounded to 66.67% but is truncated to 66.66%, this would not be meeting the quantitative component. Qualitative Example: A cumulative GPA of 1.999999 would not be rounded to 2.00 b ut is truncated to 1.99, this would not be meeting the qualitative component. Incomplete Grades Incomplete grades are designated as an \"I\" (Incomplete) or \"IP\" (In Progress) are not calculated in the GPA but are calculated in the attempted hours completi on rate. Once the \"I\" or \"IP\" grades are updated to actual grades, the cumulative GPA will be checked at that time. If a student does not meet the standards after recalculation and has received funds for classes, the funds will have to be repaid by the s tudent. Treatment Transfer Hours Transfer students accepted by Georgia Northwestern Technical College, but not previously at GNTC, will be classified as maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress for the first term of attendance. After the first term, t he student's grades will be measured in accordance with GNTC's 414| GEORGIA NORTHWESTE RN TECHNICAL COLLEGE 2020 -2021 CATALOG Satisfactory Academic requirements. Students who previously attended GNTC, transferred to another school, then returned to GNTC, will re -enter GNTC at the Satisfactory Academic Progress status the student was at when they left GNTC. If a student fails to meet the qualitative or quantitative standards at the end of a term, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Warning. The student will continue to receive aid while on Financial Aid Warnin g. However, if the student does not meet the qualitative and quantitative standards by the end of the warning term, he/she will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. The student can continue taking courses while on suspension at the student's expense. Excluded Grades Prior to Summer Quarter 2010, the college had a process through which a student was able to have specific course(s) removed from his or her academic history. If requested and approved, the class(es) affected are reflected with \"E\" (exclude d) beside the points assigned the class on the academic transcript. As the excluded class is not calculated into the student's overall academic GPA, it is also excluded from the student's GPA related to Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Excluded classes, however, do affect a student's successful completion rate for SAP with regard to the grade received. Please see the \"Completion Rate\" section of the policy about specific grades and their impacts to this area of SAP. Policy for Reinstatement of El igibility for Financial Aid 1. A student whose GPA is classified as unsatisfactory can re -establish eligibility when the cumulative GPA reaches 2.0. Students may re -establish good standing when they have cumulatively completed 66.67% of their attempted cr edit hours. 2. The above requirements to re -establish financial aid will be at the student's expense unless a Financial Aid Appeal has been approved. Financial Aid Appeal Process Students that did not meet the qualitative and/or the quantitative components will be notified via their GNTC student email account of their failure to make satisfactory academic progress at the end of every term after grades have been posted. If the stud ent was placed on Financial Aid Suspension and feels there were extenuating circumstances beyond his/her control that kept him/her from maintaining satisfactory progress, he/she may appeal in writing by completing the Financial Aid Appeal form (supporting documentation must be attached). Examples of extenuating circumstances include, but are not limited to: death or extended illness of a family member, illness or injury of student, house fire, or victim of a violent crime. Work conflicts are not extenuatin g circumstances. Appeals must be submitted by the last day of the semester for which the student is requesting reinstatement of financial aid. Only completed appeals will be considered submitted. The Executive Director of Financial Aid will refer the a ppeal to the Satisfactory Academic Appeals Committee for review. The Satisfactory Academic Appeals Committee is a three person committee made up of non -financial aid personnel that are selected in a volunteer capacity by the Executive Director of Financia l Aid. In the event a primary committee member is not in the office to perform their committee duties in a timely manner, a backup may step in and review appeals in their place. These back -ups include the Executive Director of Financial Aid, the Associat e Director of Financial Aid and the Financial Aid Specialist in charge of the SAP Appeal process. FINANCIAL INFORMATIO N| 415 Appeal forms are available from the Financial Aid Office or from the college website. Students will be notified of the Committee's decision within two wee ks of submitting the appeal via their GNTC student email account. Students that meet both the qualitative and the quantitative components but have exceeded the max-timeframe their program allows will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. These students have the opportunity to appeal by completing the Financial Aid Appeal form for Max -Timeframe. The Executive Director of Financial Aid and the Associate Director of Financial Aid review these appeals. Outcome of Appeals The Satisfactory Academic Appeals Committee is charged with making the final appeal decision. They have three outcomes to choose from that are listed below. Please note that the Committee's decision is final and cannot be appealed to a higher authority at the college or to the Departmen t of Education. Probation Students may have their appeal approved on a Probationary status for their next term of enrollment. The committee will only consider the outcome of Financial Aid Probation if the student can meet the required standards by the end of the subsequent payment period. In order to receive aid for future terms, the SAP standards of a 2.0 GPA and a completion rate of 66.67% of all classes attempted will have to be met. If the SAP standards are not met by the next term of enrollment, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. Academic Plan Students that have their appeal approved and are placed on Academic Plan for their next term of enrollment will be required to meet a term GPA of 2.5 and a term completion rate of 100%. Students approved under the Academic Plan will be eligible to receive financial aid for up to 3 terms as long as they meet the requirements of the plan for each term. The Academic Plan is designed to assist students in meeting the standards within 3 terms of enrollment. If a s tudent takes all Learning Support courses during any semester under an Academic Plan, they must pass each Learning Support course with a \"C*\" or better. Denied Students that have their appeal denied will remain on Financial Aid Suspension and will no t be eligible for any Financial Aid until the standards are met. Federal Pell Grant (Pell) Students who demonstrate financial need, and are enrolled in an eligible program, may be eligible for the Pell Grant. The amount of the grant may range from $400 to $5,550 per academic year (subject to change), depending on the level of federal funding, cost of education, enrollment status, and the student's Expected Family Contribution, which is taken from the Student Aid Report. Complete eligibility requirements are available from the Financial Assistance Office. 416| GEORGIA NORTHWESTE RN TECHNICAL COLLEGE 2020 -2021 CATALOG Pell Recalculation Policy Each term, the financial aid office will set a Pell Recalculation Date to coincide with no show reporting for the term. This is typically is within seven instructional days of the full term. Any changes to enrollment after this date will not change a student's calculated Pell award. Exceptions to this policy include when a student adds a class for the first time t hat semester (i.e. adds a mini -session class that starts later in the term as their initial enrollment), when a student fails to begin attendance in a class, or when the college receives an initial FAFSA for the student. In these cases, Pell must be recalculated. For example, if a student begins fall term in August in six credit hours and in October decides to add a class for the mini -session that begins in October, the student will not receive additional Pell funds for the October class. The student i s only eligible for the Pell funds calculated on the 6 hours of enrollment once the no shows have been reported and processed. This only applies to Pell funds Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) The Federal Educational Supplemental Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) is for undergraduates with exceptional financial need, that is, students with the lowest Expected Family Contribution, and priority is given to students wh o receive Federal Pell Grants. There is no guarantee that every eligible student will be able to receive an FSEOG. Federal Work -Study This program allows students to work in on -campus jobs and earn money to pay their educational expenses. Students will typically be paid the federal Minimum Wage and are paid semi -monthly based on the number of hours worked. Students should apply for federal student assistance initially, and their eligibility for Federal Work -Study will be determine d from their Student Aid Report. Students should contact the Financial Assistance Office for more details. Federal Direct Student Loans Federal Direct Loans are low -interest student loans that must be repaid after you g raduate or drop below half -time enrollment. Direct Loans are a form of federal financial aid, and may only be received by students who are: Enrolled half -time (six credit hours) or more. Making Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). The Fi nancial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress policy is available in the Office of Student Financial Aid and online at http://www.gntc.edu/admissions/financial -aid/how -to-apply.php. Eligible for federal aid - see the link http://www.gntc.edu/admissions/fina ncial-aid/eligibility.php for more information. The Office of Student Financial Aid determines your eligibility for the Direct Loan based on the results of your FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), cost of attendance, and other financial aid received. This includes agency payments such as Vocational Rehabilitation, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), and Trade Assistance Act (TAA). It is the student's responsibility to notify the Financial Aid Office of any outside scholarships or agency payments. FINANCIAL INFORMATIO N| 417 Subsidized Direct Loan: You must have financial need (based on FAFSA results) to qualify for the Subsidized Direct Loan. Unsubsidized Direct Loan: This version of the Federal Direct Loan is not based on financial need. However, the amoun t of the loan, combined with other financial aid resources, cannot exceed the cost of attendance. The borrower is responsible for all interest charges on an Unsubsidized Direct Loan from the time the loan is disbursed. While you are not required to make pa yments while you are in school or during grace or deferment periods, we recommend that you pay interest quarterly. Any accrued interest that is not paid will be added (capitalized) to the loan balance when you enter repayment. Financial Aid Award Availabil ity for Bookstore Use The Business Office will allow students to use a Bookstore Credit that will consist of 100% of Pell funds, up to $600 and is calculated after all Institutional Charges have been deducted from a student's Pell award. Students may use the Bookstore Credit to charge books and supplies in campus bookstores. An additional authorization amount above $600 can be obtained with Business Office Approval, subject to the availability of residual Pell award(s). If a student chooses to \"opt out\" of the bookstore credit, then the student needs to complete the \"Request to Opt -Out of Bookstore Credit\" form located at the Cashier's window of the Business Office one week before the start of the semester. Please note the \"opt out\" option does NOT allow you to receive your finan cial aid Pell Grant refund early. HOPE Scholarship Programs The HOPE Scholarship Programs are administered by the Georgia Student Finance Commission (GSFC) and consist of the Zell Miller Scholarship and HOPE Scholarship for degree programs and HOPE Grant for diploma and certificate programs. Effective fall semester 2011, the HOPE Scholarship and HOPE Grant will pay a percentage called a factor rate of the prior year tuition amount. This amount can change from year to year. Brief summaries of each program are listed below. For full descriptions of each program, visit the Financial Aid Office. HOPE Scholarship The HOPE Scholarship is a state funded program available for students who are working toward a degree program. The student must be a Georgia resident and considered a HOPE Scholar. A HOPE Scholar is a 1993 or later high school graduate with a 3.0 or higher Grade Point Average (GPA) from high school. The high schools will notify GSFC of students who qualify. A student who did not graduate as a HOPE Scholar can become a HOPE Scholar after at tempting 30/45, 60/90, or 90/135 semester/quarter hours with a 3.0 or better GPA. To continue receiving the HOPE Scholarship, degree students must maintain a 3.0 GPA at each check point. The student's GPA will be checked after the student has attempted 30, 60 and 90 semester hours and at the end of each spring term. First -year scholars (less than 30 hours) who attend less than full time will be checked at the end of the third term. There is a maximum number of hours that a student can attempt, which is 127 semester hours. The HOPE Scholarship will no longer pay any amounts toward fees and books. GSFC has implemented a 7 -year rule. Students who received HOPE Scholarship prior to Summer Term 2011, are eligible to receive HOPE Scholarship until June 30, 2099, r egardless of high school graduation date. First time HOPE Scholarship recipients Summer Quarter 2011 or later are bound by the 7 -year rule. Students who had not received a HOPE Scholarship award prior to Summer Term 2011, an expiration date will be set for each student as June 30th of the 7th academic year following his or her high school graduation. For students that graduated from a home school program or received a GED, the date of the student's home school completion/graduate or GED test date will be us ed as the 418| GEORGIA NORTHWESTE RN TECHNICAL COLLEGE 2020 -2021 CATALOG basis for determining the 7 -year expiration date. Students can lose and regain eligibility once beginning Fall Term 2011. Any previous gains/losses prior to Fall Term 2011 will not apply. Zell Miller Scholarship A student who graduated high school with a 3.7 or higher GPA and with SAT score of 1200 or ACT score of 26 on a single administered test is eligible. The Valedictorian and Salutatorian from a high school graduating class are considered automatically eligible , regardless of GPA/SAT/ACT. Current students must meet the GPA/SAT/ACT requirement from high school and have at least a 3.3 GPA at the 30, 60 or 90 semester hour check point of their college coursework. HOPE/Zell Miller Grant HOPE/Zell Miller Grant is a state funded program available for students who are working toward a diploma or certificate program. The student must be a Georgia resident. HOPE/Zell Miller Grant will no longer pay fees or book amounts. Students must maintai n a 2.0 HOPE Grant GPA to receive the HOPE Grant. If the student is able to meet and maintain a 3.5 HOPE Grant GPA the student will receive the Zell Miller Grant, which pays 100% tuition for most programs. A HOPE/Zell Miller Grant recipient will have the ir GPA checked at the 30 and 60 credit hour check points. A student can lose the Zell Miller Grant by dropping below a 3.5 but will receive the HOPE Grant if the GPA is still at or above a 2.0. Students cannot receive both HOPE Grant and Zell Miller Grant in the same semester. The HOPE/Zell Miller CAP of 63 semester hours will apply to all programs. Return of Title IV Funds Policy If a student withdraws, (officially or unofficially), any Federal Aid received is subj ect to the \"Return of Title IV Funds.\" For officially withdrawn students, the withdrawal date is the date the Office of the Registrar receives and stamps the withdrawal form (usually the start date of the withdrawal process). For unofficially withdrawn st udents, the withdrawal date is the midpoint of the term or the last reported date of an academically related activity, whichever is later. A percentage of unearned funds will be returned to the proper fund. The number of calendar days attended during the term is divided by the total number of calendar days in the term. The resulting percentage is multiplied by the student's Title IV (excluding FWS) aid for the term. This is the new amount the student is entitled to receive (paying Pell first). The follow ing formula will be used to determine return of funds: Number of days attended /number of days in term = percentage (%) earned (Including holidays and weekends) Earned 100% if greater than 60%, if less than 60% then, 100% - percentage (%) earned = percenta ge (%) unearned For more information concerning this policy, please see the Financial Aid Office. If a student registers for two mini sessions and then withdraws from the first mini session, but plans to attend the second mini session of the term, the stud ent needs to notify the financial aid office in writing of his/her intention of returning for the second registered class(s). If the student returns, in this scenario, no Return of Title IV calculation is necessary. If the student does not return, aid must be reduced to pay only for hours attended and Return of Title IV Funds calculation has to be performed, using the original withdrawal date. FINANCIAL INFORMATIO N| 419 Rehabilitation Services Vocational Rehabilitation cooperates with Georgia Northwest ern Technical College by providing financial assistance to students who have disabilities and who qualify for vocational rehabilitation. Veterans' Benefits Veterans' benefits are available to qualified veterans and dependents of deceased or disabled veterans. Applicants should contact the financial aid office on the campus of GNTC the student plans to attend in order to obtain an application. Tuition refunds for students receiving veterans' benefits through the Department of Veter ans Affairs will be prorated over the length of the course. The fees are non -refundable. Title 38 United States Code Section 3679(e) School Compliance NOTE: A Covered Individual is any individual who is entitled to educational assistance under Chapter 31, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, or Chapter 33, Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. Georgia Northwestern Technical College permits any covered individual to attend or participate in the course of education during the period beginning on the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution a certificate of eligibility for entitlement to educational assistance under Chapter 31 or 33 and ending on the earlier of the dates below. A \"certificate of eligibility\" can also include a \"Statement of Benefits\" obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) website - eBenefits, or a VAF 28 -1905 form for Chapter 31 authorization purposes.. 1. The date on which payment from VA is made to the institution. 2. 90 days after the date the institution certified tuition and fees following the receipt of the certificate of eligibility. Georgia Northwestern Technical College will ensure that the covered individual will not impose any penalty, including the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional funds, on any covered individual because of the individual's inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the institution due to the delayed disbursement funding from VA under Chapter 31 or 33. In addition, Georgia Northwestern Technical College requires the covered individual to take the following additional actions: 1. Submit a certificate of eligibility for entitlement to educational assistance no later than the first day of a course of education. 2. Submit a written request to use such entitlement. 3. Provide additional information necessary to the proper certification of enrollment by the educational institution. 4. A required payment or fee may be imposed for the amount that is the difference between the amount of the student's financial obligation and the amount of the VA education benefit disbursement. Workforce Innovation and Opportunitie s Act (WIOA) The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is a federally funded program available to those who have been displaced from their employment or have very low family income and meet all e ligibility requirements and other grant selection guidelines. Meeting all eligibility requirements does not guarantee acceptance into the WIA program. Qualified applicants must maintain a satisfactory Grade Point Average (GPA) and academic progress. The WI A program assists eligible, full -time students with all program required materials such as books and supplies and may assist with tuition and fees. WIOA also pays a small travel stipend and assists with child care expenses.

At the end of each semester, the achievement of each student is reported using the following system of grade assignment. See explanation of grading symbols after listing. Quality points are used in computing grade point average (GPA). ACADEMIC INFORMATION | 425 A = 90-100 Excellent (4 quality points) B = 80-89 Good (3 quality points) C = 70-79 Satisfactory (2 quality points - See note a t the bottom of this list.) D = 60-69 Poor (1 quality point) F = Below 60 -Failing (0 quality point) AC = Articulated Credit AU = Audit Course EXE = Credit Course Exempted (not computed) I = Incomplete (not computed) IP = In Progress (not computed) TR = Credit Course Transferred (not computed) W = Withdrew (not computed) WF = Withdrew Failing (0 quality points) - Used through Fall 2020 Z = Unsuccessful completion due to COVID -19 emergency. (Z is excluded from attempted hours and GPA calculations) Note: A grade of \"C\" or better is required in a prerequisite course before a student can progress to the next level of instruction. A minimum a verage of \"C\" (2.0 GPA) is required for graduation. \"EXE\" Credit by Examination: Upon request and approval, an exemption test may be administered to a student to determine if the student has already gained mastery of the course competencies (See Credit by Examination under Academic Information found in the college catalog). If the student achieves satisfactory performance on the exam, a grade of \"EXE\" will be recorded. The \"EXE\" grade carries no grade points, but credit hours will be given identical to th e number of credit hours normally assigned to that course at the college. \"AU\" Audit: \"AU\" indicates the course was taken for no credit. By auditing a course, the student is allowed to attend class without meeting admission requirements and does not rec eive a grade or credit. Students who audit courses must pay regular tuition, admission, and registration fees. Students are not allowed to change from audit to credit status or from credit to audit status once the term has begun. \"AC\" Articulated Credit: \"AC\" indicates course credit awarded for selected high school classes that meet the Advanced Technical College Credit criteria based on agreement with a high school. \"I\" Incomplete: An incomplete grade indicates the student who is performing satisfactory work is unable to meet full course requirements for nonacademic reasons, circumstances beyond the control of the student or instructor. An \"I\" is recorded until the final grade is established. The incomplete is assigned only after the student has made arra ngements with the instructor for fulfilling the course requirements. An \"I\" must be resolved by the end of the third week of the subsequent semester, or the incomplete grade will automatically become an \"F.\" If a grade of \"I\" is received in any course that is a prerequisite to other courses, then the student must complete the required prerequisite and receive a satisfactory final grade to be eligible to enroll in the next level course. \"IP\" In Progress: \"IP\" indicates that a final grade could not be post ed because the course was not scheduled to be completed at the end of the term. An \"IP\" grade will remain on the student's record until the instructor completes a change of grade form. 426| GEORGIA NORTHWESTE RN TECHNICAL COLLEGE 2020 -2021 CATALOG \"TR\" Transfer Credit: \"TR\" indicates that the student has successfu lly completed the course at another postsecondary institution. A grade of \"TR\" carries no quality points. The student will, however, receive comparable credit hours at the college for the credit hours received at the former institution. \"W\" Withdrawal: \"W\" indicates that a student was permitted to withdraw from a course without academic penalty. Withdrawal without penalty will not be permitted past the deadline posted on the academic calendar. \"*\" Learning Support Class: A letter grade followed by an asterisk (*) indicates a learning support course. This grade will not be calculated in the Academic GPA, but will be calculated in the student's financial aid GPA for the Hope Scholarship program. All F grades will have a last date of attendance recorde d and must be supported with an academically related activity. Academically related activities include, but are not limited to: physically attending a class where there is an opportunity for direct interaction between the instructor and students, submi tting an academic assignment, taking an exam, an interactive tutorial or computer -assisted instruction, attending a study group that is assigned by the school, participating in an online discussion about academic matters, and initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a question about the academic subject studied in the course. Academically related activities do NOT include activities where a student may be present, but not academically engaged, such as: participating in student life activities, logging into an online class without active participation, or participating in academic counseling or advising. Semester Grade Point Average Students will be awarded quality points for e ach credit course grade according to the following scale: A = 4 Quality Points B = 3 Quality Points C = 2 Quality Points D = 1 Quality Point F = 0 Quality Points The quality points awarded are then multiplied by the credits for that course to get the quali ty points earned for the course. Quality points earned for all semester courses are then totaled and divided by the total credits for the semester to obtain the semester grade point average (GPA). Grades of \"W\" and \"WP\" are not counted in the cumulative GP A. Hours transferred to GNTC via course exemption and/or prior credit for training are not counted in determining the GPA. Grades of \"WF\" will be recorded and calculated as an \"F\" in the GPA. Learning Support Courses will not affect GPA. ACADEMIC INFORMATION | 427 GPA Computation Ex ample Grades Quality Points X Course Credit Hours = Total Quality Points for Course A in a course gives 4 quality points X 5 credit hour course = 20 total quality points for course. (4x5=20) B in course gives 3 quality point s X 10 credit hour course = 30 total quality points for course. (3x10=30) C in course gives 2 quality points X 5 credit hour course = 10 total quality points for course. (2 X 5 = 10) Total Quality Points for Semester = 60 (20+30+10) Total Quality Points fo r Semester \u00f7 Total Credit Hours for Semester = Semester Grade Point Average; therefore, 60 \u00f7 20 = 3 (Semester GPA). Cumulative Grade Point Average A student's cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) is the average of all grade points earned at the college. This average is calculated in the same manner as the semester GPA (See GPA Computation Example), but includes all attempts at all credit courses taken at the College. The cumulative GPA is recorded on the student's perm anent record. Work Ethics Grade A code of ethics is basic to all cultures, groups, and professions. Ethics provide guidelines for living and performing, and they serve as the basis for making difficult decisions. Classroom instruc tion on ethical work standards is, therefore, provided in occupational courses, and students receive the opportunity to practice and be evaluated on these ethics in an educational setting before they enter the workplace. The Technical College System of Geo rgia instructs and evaluates students on work ethic in all programs of study. Ten work ethic traits have been identified and defined as essential for students success; appearance, attendance, attitude, character, communication, cooperation, organizational skill, productivity, respect, and teamwork. Students in occupational courses are evaluated twice each semester in terms of work ethics at midterm and at the end of the semester. This evaluation is reflected in a separate grade on their transcript. Students in online courses also receive work ethics grades. Attributes measured are those appropriate to online instruction. Work Ethics grades are not given in Learning Support courses and are given at the instructor's discretion in General Education courses. The grading and Grade reports are posted to the MyGNTC approximately one week after the final examination period. Students can check their grades on MyGNTC at www.gntc.edu. Grades will not be given out by phone or by email. Grade Appeal Policy If there is a dispute over the final grade awarded for a particular course, the student must initia te the grade appeal process, in writing, no later than the end of the third week of the subsequent semester for which the grade was earned. 428| GEORGIA NORTHWESTE RN TECHNICAL COLLEGE 2020 -2021 CATALOG Good Academic Standing A student is considered to be in good academic standing if he/ she maintains a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. A cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher is also required for graduation. Academic Probation and Suspension Any student who earns a semester GPA of less than 2.0 will be pl aced on academic probation during the next semester of enrollment. A student placed on academic probation must meet with his/her advisor to develop intervention strategies. A student will be suspended for one semester if the semester GPA falls below a 2.0 for two consecutive semesters. When a student is suspended, that student is not allowed to enroll in classes for the next term. During the first semester of enrollment after academic suspension, a student is placed on academic probation. A student is remov ed from academic probation by earning a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher. Drop/Add Period Students may add and/or drop courses through the third instructional day of the term without penalty. To make a schedule change during the drop/a dd period, students must log in to MyGNTC. Any student who enters a course after the first day of instruction is required to complete all missed assignments as required by the instructor and should attend the first available class after registration. GNTC No Show Policy Instructors are required to provide students with a graded activity within the first seven instructional days of the term for enrollment verification purposes. After drop/add and within the first seven instruct ional days of the term, instructors are required to accurately report students as either \"Present\" (P) or as a \"No Show\" (NS). A \"no show\" student is a student who fails to verify intent by completing a graded assignment prior to the instructor's no show deadline. Rosters will be verified in MyGNTC, and any student reported as a \"no show\" by an instructor will be administratively withdrawn from the course and removed from the official course roster. Failure to accurately report students as either \"Pres ent\" or \"No Show\" by the no show reporting deadline may have negative monetary consequences for the student and/or college. If a student is reported incorrectly, then the instructor must submit a Registration Status Change Form located on GNET2 with the d ocumented reason for the request to either \"no show\" the student or \"reinstate\" the student. The form will be routed to the appropriate academic dean for review, and the dean will forward the documentation to the associate vice president of academic affai rs for approval. Students whose names do not appear on the official class roster must not be allowed to continue in the course. Withdrawal from Courses Students are responsible for initiating a withdrawal from a course. After the Drop/Add period during the beginning of a term, any student withdrawing from a class will receive a grade of \"W\" through 60% of the term. The last date which a student may officially withdraw from a class is posted on the Academic Calendar loca ted on the GNTC website. A student who wishes to withdraw from a course(s), but who does not want to totally withdraw from the college, can obtain a Drop/Add form ACADEMIC INFORMATION | 429 from a Student Help Center located on any GNTC campus or on the GNTC website under Registrar Forms. A student who stops attending after the deadline to withdraw may receive a failing grade and/or loss of financial aid.

Declaring a Major At Georgia Northwestern Technical College, each degree and diploma program requires students to progress through the following instructional course categories in a developmentally valid sequence: General Core Curriculum Occupational Curriculum Students are encouraged to enroll in a combination of general education courses and occupationa l courses. Each degree or diploma program complies with program admission standards and competency prerequisites established in the relevant program -specific standards. Students are required to complete prerequisite courses prior to enrolling in subsequent courses. General Core Curriculum The general education courses for the degree programs provide the foundations in Language Arts/Communication, Social/Behavioral Sciences, Natural Sciences/Mathematics, and Humanities/Fine Arts. Occupational Curriculum Occupa tional courses are those technical courses that form the majority of the student's program of study. The specific content of the major is determined by the curriculum requirements of each program. Learning Support Studies Because GNTC is dedicated to helping its students succeed, importance is placed on testing, placement, and remediation of students. Learning Support courses in reading and writing skills as well as in mathematics are required for students whose placement scores indicate that they need ACADEMIC INFORMATION | 433 remediation in one or more academic area. Students lacking the minimum required SAT or ACT scores will be given a placement test after the application for admission and the admission fee have been submitted. This test is used for counseling and placement purposes only. Students will be placed in Learning Support courses based on the test score requirements for their program of study. Test score requirements are posted on the GNTC website under Admissions/Testing Center. Studen ts placed in ENGL 0090 - Learning Support English or MATH 0090 - Learning Support Math will also be required to take COLL 1500 Student Success. Students are not eligible to graduate if Learning Support courses, including COLL 1500 Student Success, have not b een completed. Associate Degree Programs Each student seeking an associate degree at the college is required to satisfactorily complete at least 15 hours in general education that provide the foundations in Language Arts /Communication, Social/Behavioral Sciences, Natural Sciences/Mathematics, and Humanities/Fine Arts.

Diploma Programs Each student completing a diploma program at the college is required to satisfactorily complete a minimum number of hours in diploma basic skill s courses, based on the program standards. For the diploma -seeking student, that course of study typically consists of an appropriate course in mathematics, English, and psychology. This requirement is based upon the belief that to be well - trained is not e nough. Today's technician must also be competent in the use of written and spoken language, possess adequate computational skills, and have good interpersonal skills. Online Classes An online course is one delivered over the Internet using Blackboard Learning Management System (LMS) through the Georgia Virtual Technical Connections. Hybrid courses use the LMS and also meet on campus part of the time. Web -enhanced classes meet on campu s the required time but have some components in the LMS. Online -the course instruction is entirely online and communication with your instructor is done within an online learning management system. Some courses require a proctored exam. Syllabus must be checked. Hybrid -the course is taught partially online and on campus. The amount of time spent in the classroom can vary by instructor. This structure offers the opportunity to be in the classroom for personal communication. Web-enhanced -all meetings ar e on campus, but many components of the course, like the syllabus, assignments, etc. will be housed in the learning management system. Students are issued a username and password for the Blackboard LMS, which should be kept confidential and never passed t o another student or family member. Course Substitution The college will permit substitution from the prescribed curricula only under unavoidable or exceptional circumstances. To request a deviation from the prescribed course of study, the student should first consult an advisor in that program area. If the student is advised to pursue the course substitution, the advisor will complete a Course Substitution Form, describing the substitutions 434| GEORGIA NORTHWESTE RN TECHNICAL COLLEGE 2020 -2021 CATALOG sought and the reason for making that request. The completed form will be submitted to the office of the Registrar for review. Auditing a Course A student who wishes to audit a course must complete an application for admission and pay the application fee. Students wh o audit a class will receive an \"AU\" grade in the course and will not have the grade computed in the term or cumulative grade point average. Students who register to audit a class: Are not allowed to receive credit for the course (however, students will be permitted to re - register for the course for credit in a subsequent term); Are required to complete a Request to Audit Form at the time of registration on the GNTC website under Registrar Forms; Are not permitted to change from audit to credit or f rom credit to audit after the Drop/Add period for the term; Are cautioned to be aware that courses taken on an audit basis may not be used for certification of enrollment for many forms of financial aid or other benefits; Students must meet all prerequ isites for the courses they audit. Are required to pay regular tuition and fees and are subject to the same instructional requirements as other students in the class. Financial aid will not cover classes being audited. Change of Major (Program Transfer) Students have the privilege of transferring from one program to another while enrolled at Georgia Northwestern Technical College. In the event a student declares a change of major, the student's placement test sco res and previously earned credits will be evaluated in terms of the new major. In some instances, a change of major will result in additional General Education course work. The student must meet admission requirements and any other qualifications for the n ew major. Students desiring to change their majors should complete a Change of Status form available in the Student Help Center located on all campuses. Students may change their major prior to the first day of the semester and no later than the last day of the designated drop/add period of the semester. Some programs may have waiting lists and may not be available for immediate entry.
