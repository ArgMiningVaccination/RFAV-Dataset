Some studies found [chiropractic care can help patients with back-related pain](https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2016-11-09/the-pros-and-cons-of-seeing-a-chiropractor) and neck pain. Is it safe? Not always. Adjustments to your neck [can increase your risk of stroke](https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2016-11-09/the-pros-and-cons-of-seeing-a-chiropractor), according to a American Heart Association report.

Because of the severity of possible injuries, many doctors advise patients to avoid rapid neck manipulations. In contrast, adjustments to your thoracic or lumbar spine are [considered safe](https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2016-11-09/the-pros-and-cons-of-seeing-a-chiropractor). How common is it? A 2016 survey found that [35 million US adults saw a chiropractor ](https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2016-11-09/the-pros-and-cons-of-seeing-a-chiropractor)in the previous 12 months.

[A review of studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1356689X16308165)found that although there were some studies that found a positive impact of osteopathic manipulative treatment, the studies were not high quality nor numerous enough to prove that these treatments are beneficial. Is it safe? Unlike chiropractors, [osteopaths can manipulate the neck](https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2016-11-09/the-pros-and-cons-of-seeing-a-chiropractor) without a risk of a serious injury. However, as with all medical treatments, there is still some degree of risk. For instance, patients may feel stiff and/or have a headache after treatment. [Less common side effects](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/70381.php), which are more common in older patients, include severe pain, rib fracture in patients with osteoporosis, numbness and tingling. There are also very serious side effects that occur rarely, including stroke, prolapsed disk, nerve damage, muscle weakness and bladder or bowel problems. How many osteopathic doctors are there? In the US, there are over 100,000 practicing Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine. Homeopathy Homeopathy, also called homeopathic medicine, is a German medical system that is over 200 years old. These medicines are [based on 2 unconventional theories](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy): - \"Like cures like\" - the belief that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people. - \"Law of minimum dose\" - the belief that the lower the dose of the medication, the greater its effectiveness. Therefore, many homeopathic products are so diluted they contain no molecules of the original substance. What are homeopathic products? Homeopathic products come from plants (including red onion, arnica, poison ivy, and stinging nettle), minerals (including white arsenic), or animals (including crushed whole bees). Homeopathic products come in many forms, including sugar pellets, ointments, gels, drops, creams, and tablets. Practitioners individualize treatments for each patient. Therefore, different people with the same condition can receive different treatments. Do they work? There's [little evidence that homeopathic products effectively treat](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy) any specific health condition. For instance, a comprehensive analysis in 2015 by the Australian government found no reliable evidence that homeopathy effectively helps any health condition. As you might expect, homeopathy is a controversial topic since some of the key theories don't agree with fundamental science. Furthermore, the extreme dilutions and individualized treatments make studying these products difficult. Are they safe? That depends. Unfortunately, there has not been enough research on the safety of homeopathic products. However, there are safety concerns. First of all, some products [labeled as homeopathic](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy) may contain significant amounts of active ingredients which could cause side effects and drug interactions. Furthermore, a 2012 [systematic review identified some dangers](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy). For instance, certain homeopathic products contain dangerous levels of heavy metals like mercury or iron. Additionally, the reviewers found that patients who replace an effective conventional treatment with an ineffective homeopathic product can suffer adverse effects, some of which can be serious. Additionally, [the FDA has warned the public](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy) about specific homeopathic products, including teething tablets and asthma products. Talk to your doctor and proceed with skepticism and caution. How popular are these treatments? According to a 2012 survey, an estimated [5 million adults and 1 million children in the US use homeopathy products](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy) each year. The survey data indicates that among the adults using homeopathic products, most self-prescribe them for colds and musculoskeletal pain. "}
