Buy with ease, your [alternative medicines online](/) in your bio pharmacy, in order to find, form and vitality, quickly and for a long time! These natural treatments are the result of long years of research. Millions of people have benefited from the experience of the greatest naturopaths, aromatherapists, homeopaths, herbalists and doctors specializing in alternative and natural medicine. These specialists have proven that a holistic approach to the causes of a disease leads to lasting healing. There are different alternative health medicines that can help you heal yourself on a daily basis. However, resorting to alternative medicine does not dispense with medical advice. The benefits of natural medicines for your health Alternative medicines, also called natural medicines, are those that do not use drugs and chemical molecules to treat patients. The practice of alternative medicine considers the individual as a whole and does not focus only on the symptom, unlike traditional medicine, which focuses only on the diseased organ. Complementary or alternative therapies, soft, alternative or unconventional medicine... there is a considerable number of practices that go beyond the scope of traditional medicine. Natural medicines aim to harmonize vital energy to preserve our physical and moral well-being. Natural therapies allow you to regain awareness of your body and how your emotions relate to your physical feelings. Sophrology, reflexology, [organic food supplements](/en/125-complements-alimentaires) or massage with essential oils, for example, can help you sleep better, reduce your anxiety and even lose weight. But in the event of prolonged illness, one should not choose a natural health product without first consulting a doctor or a naturopathic professional. How to choose a recognized alternative medicine More and more French people are turning to alternative medicine . But what do these therapeutic approaches correspond to? Sometimes called alternative medicine , complementary medicine, complementary medicine , or even natural medicine, these natural health practices are diverse, both in the techniques they employ and in the theoretical foundations they invoke. Their common point is that they are neither scientifically recognized by conventional medicine nor taught during the initial training of health professionals. The various natural methods offered by this holistic solution are intriguing, but are increasingly recommended, even by the most fervent scientists. Concretely, the expression \"alternative medicine\" should not be used, because natural medicines do not represent alternatives to conventional medicine, but complementary approaches to allopathic medicine. If the success of alternative medicine has continued to grow lately, we must not forget that these natural medicines remain complementary therapeutic approaches. In parallel with conventional medicine, they bring three interesting added values: - Contribute to the prevention of health problems; - Promote a better general state of health for optimal physical and mental well-being; - Relieve certain consequences of illnesses or certain side effects of conventional treatments. In any case, alternative medicine can not replace a medical diagnosis or medical treatment. This notion is essential to prevent any risk of drift, both on the part of practitioners and on the part of patients.

Herbal medicine, health through medicinal plants [Phytotherapy](/en/10-pharmacie-phytotherapie-parapharmacie) is the use of plants or medicines made from medicinal plants (powders, preparations in ampoules, infusions, etc.) to naturally treat the various ailments of the human body.

It is a solution that is both alternative and complementary to the treatments of classical medicine, more and more in vogue and whose effectiveness is increasingly recognized.
