The MRI imaging showed that true acupuncture yielded greater activity over sham acupuncture in the dorsomedial prefontal cortex of the brain. Real acupuncture produced significantly \"greater activity in both cognitive/evaluative (posterior dmPFC) and emotional/interoceptive (anterior dmPFC) cortical regions\" and MRI results showed that true acupuncture \"increased cognitive load.\"1 Recent criticisms concerning the effectiveness of acupuncture have focused on the ability of sham acupuncture to produce clinical results. However, MRI studies show that true acupuncture produces clinical results by different cortical mechanisms than sham acupuncture. NIH researchers question the validity of sham acupuncture control groups. Dr. R. E. Harris's (NIH researcher, Ann Arbor, Michigan) research was able to prove that although sham acupuncture and true acupuncture reduce pain in fibromyalgia patients, they \"do it by different mechanisms.\" Dr. Harris's research showed that differing mechanisms by which the pain relief was achieved was measured at the molecular level. This suggests that sham acupuncture may superficially cause pain reduction but that it is not scientifically achieved by the same mechanisms as true acupuncture. Dr. Richard L. Nahin of the NIH's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine states, \"If you look at some of the data, what you find is that sham acupuncture and true acupuncture both produce some pain relief in whatever condition they're looking at. But while both treatments turn on areas of the brain, they turn on different areas of the brain.\"2 References: 1a. Brain encoding of acupuncture sensation - coupling on-line rating with fMRI. V.
