With the Fall 2022 semester underway, Baylor University has updated its COVID-19 protocols, most notably on Isolation/Quarantine, as well as face coverings, testing and vaccination. The protocols are based on the latest guidance from the CDC and the Waco-McLennan County Public Health District. It was such a joy last week to experience the musical and dance talents of the more than 1,500 students who participated in Sing this spring. One outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is that we have the ability to temporarily pivot to remote instruction and operations when winter weather conditions threaten. Gone are the days of waking up at 5 a.m. to see if it will be an ice or snow day. Of course, I fondly remember those snow days from when I was in college! Today we are announcing the rescission of the University's facemask policy for classrooms and labs when used in academic settings. In other words, facemasks will be optional at Baylor - other than when requested in private offices - effective this Monday, Feb. 21. As many of you are probably aware, many states, colleges and universities, and other organizations across the country are beginning to loosen their facemask requirements in response to the declining prevalence of COVID-19.
