In 2006, the CDC extended influenza vaccine recommendations to include children aged 2 to 4 years. However, Canada did not institute this recommendation until 2010, which allowed researchers to compare emergency room visits for influenza-like symptoms in Boston and Montreal before and after the U.S. recommendation change. Study data recently published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal indicated that visits for influenza-like symptoms in this age group decreased by 34% after the recommendation change, reminding us that vaccination really works! Here are some facts that might help you highlight the benefits of influenza vaccine and convince reluctant parents to have their child vaccinated this year: Take some time to explain to parents the difference between influenza and other viral upper respiratory infections that they or their children may contract during the course of influenza season. Many parents mistakenly believe that because their child got sick at some point after receiving the influenza vaccine that it did not work, or if the illness happened within a week or two of vaccine administration, that the vaccine caused the illness. Try to dispel these myths. And remember to be a good example. Get your flu shot early. Tell your patients that you get vaccinated every year, you did not experience any side effects and you didn't get influenza. I know it is not easy to have these conversations with parents, but it is our job to be advocates for children's health, and so we must try. Because of your efforts, a few more children and their extended families will have less risk for contracting influenza this season. Do you have other good points to convince reluctant parents?
