Allowing a child to become infected, vaccination, and homeoprophylaxis. Allowing one to become infected with the actual disease is believed by many to be a right of passage for the young immune system and may ensure that one develops immunity to that disease in future exposure. Most parents do not feel this to be a viable option of immune system education. Vaccination and [homeoprophylaxis](http://freeandhealthychildren.com/) (HP), on the other hand, share the same goal of protecting from disease. While both methods use tiny doses of the disease to stimulate the immune system, these methods are actually quite different. Vaccines contain active ingredients, called \"adjuvants\", that cause the immune system to mount an immune response. Vaccines also include other ingredients such as antibiotics, chemicals, heavy metals and animal bi-products. Vaccines are injected directly into the bloodstream, bypassing all of the body's first defense mechanisms. HP contains the disease material in very minute, homeopathically diluted amounts - with no other ingredients. This material is not incubated with animal or human DNA. HP is given through the mouth in small pellets, so the intestines, where greater than 80% of immunity resides, can recognize the disease material and start the work of building immunity in a way that does not bypass the body's first defense mechanisms. Vaccines are often prepared as combinations, giving many diseases at once. It is believed that developing immune systems may get confused when trying to resolve too many diseases simultaneously. HP gives one single disease at a time. Many believe this to be the safest and most natural way is to allow the immune system time to identify, mount a natural response, and resolve the disease. HP is convenient, as it may be administered at home by the parents. HP is effective, as clinical studies have shown that it lessens the incidence of long-term chronic disease. Homeoprophylaxis educates your child's immune system gently and safely. Homeoprophylaxis has been used in practice for over 200 years, and now, in the face of growing concerns over vaccine safety, is being sought out as an alternative to vaccines. To meet this public demand, an easy and accessible way to find homeoprophylaxis in North America has been developed. A program has now been set up as a self-administered, infectious disease prevention program to help to keep our children healthy. Through this program, designed as a research model, we will also generate a body of evidence supporting an alternative to vaccination.
