Science is now confirming what has been known for centuries: Essential oils have healing properties on both physical and emotional levels. Absorbed through the skin and via the olfactory-brain connection through inhalation, they have been considered among the most therapeutic and rejuvenating of all botanical extracts throughout the ages.\" Valerie Gennari Cooksley Aromatherapy and Magick: Using Herbs & Flowers in Spells and Rituals Aromatherapy is a re-emerging art that allows us to activate our sense of smell for specific purposes. Scents have a powerful impact on both the conscious and subconscious mind. To validate this truth for yourself, just wander past a bakery first thing in the morning and see what physical and emotional responses the aromas generate. But modern Neo-Pagans are certainly not the first to figure the helpful nature of various aromatics. Even though the term aromatherapy appeared for the first time in 1937, many cultures used aromatics for everything from worshiping the gods to carrying them in a healer's kit. Many of the ancient associations for aromatics remain with us today and work wonderfully with various magical methods. For this part of your [Book of Shadows](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/book-of-shadows/personalizing-book-shadows-making-paper-scented-ink/) we'll explore ways of using [aromatherapy](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/money-spells/money-magic-abundance-aromatics/) successfully in magic also with some common herbs, flowers and spices you can use easily. You may want to copy these correspondences into your herbal section too. Short History of Aromatherapy Before humankind even thought about medicine, people burned aromatic woods and plants believing that the smoke [banished evil spirits](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/protection-binding-spells/12-magical-spells-charms-amulets-for-protection-and-banishing/). It's a neat historical fact that the word perfume originates with the Latin, per fumum meaning \"through smoke\". The tradition of burning aromatics continues to this day. It is possible that Chinese medicine may have preceded the Egyptians in using plant-based cures. History is a little sketchy, but these two cultures left the best records for us to follow. Egyptians, in particular, developed embalming which used juniper, cedar, cinnamon, myrrh and frankincense as part of the preparation process. They got their herbs via Arab merchants who knew full well about the magical benefits of plants based on folklore. Who doesn't love a good story when they're shopping? Anyway, the Egyptians loved fragrances. It was common to wear perfume at festivals. Aromatics also appeared at the bath in the form of oil. They became so adept at producing perfumes that the world heralded Egypt as having the finest aromatic preparations. Ancient Greece and the Use of Aromatherapy Magick As the world of trade grew, so too did the reach of aromatics. Various cultures including those of Assyria and Babylon adapted the Egyptian instructions, putting their own spin on things. We can thank Asclepius, a Greek physician, for his use of fragrant herbs in medical care (circa 1200 BCE). Hippocrates followed about 900 years later, using aromatics in massage, infusions and healing baths. Fast forward to 3 BCE and you find a philosopher named Theophrastus pondering the way in which scents effect human emotion. Aromatics from Persia, Perfumes & Oils In 1000 AD we find Ibn Sina a Persian physician. At the age of 20 he'd already become a court physician who dabbled in metaphysics too. Over time he wrote numerous books that included a smattering of cosmology for good measure. Alongside this study, the Persians perfected fragrance distillation. The resulting products were often part of religious observances including oil of rose, amber and musk. Aromatherapy Healing: The Anglo Saxons A book dating to around 900 BCE called Leech Book of Bald is where things start really getting interesting. The writer, Cild, penned numerous mixtures that included shamanic overtones. There were also notations about the folklore of trees and magical properties for [amulets](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/magic-magick/7-steps-for-making-magical-charms-amulets-talismans-fetishes/). It was in this region at a much later date that healers would wear aromatic herbs believing so doing would protect against the plague. Aromatic Oils in France Rene-Maurice Gattefosse, a French Chemist, came up with the term aromatherapie. He loved researching aromatic oils. His work became the foundation for Jean Valnet's work that included the use of aromatic oils for psychiatric conditions in the 1960s. Madame Marguerite Maury was also writing about the power of scents exploring their possibilities in a book in 1961. Aromatic Correspondences: Blending Aromatherapy with Magic Early shaman-priests were likely aware of sensual influences when they put aromatic woods and spices into incense. These mixtures were burned for various purposes, including averting sickness, easing sadness, [inspiring love](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/magic-magick/aromatic-love-magic/), and purification. In modern times we've begun to recognize that many of the ancient aromatic formulas still hold merit, such as the use of sage for cleansing (chemically, sage has mild anti-bacterial qualities). With this in mind, it is but a short jump forward to adapting and applying aromatic lore to our homes, and any other areas where we spend a lot of time, such as the office or in the car. Spread a ritually prepared tincture on window ledges to carry energy throughout a region with each breeze. Put a little blessed oil on light bulbs, then turn on the lamp for active energy and manifestation. Sprinkle different symbolic scents in various rooms, depending on your needs and goals. Dab a little on yourself too!
