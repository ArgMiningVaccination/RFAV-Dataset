Each policy is based on peer reviewed clinical evidence. We also take into consideration the needs of atypical patient populations and diagnoses. If the coverage criteria outlined is unlikely to be clinically effective for the prescribed purpose, the health care provider may request an exception to cover the requested medication based on an individual's unique clinical circumstances. This is also referred to as \"individual considerati on\" or an \"exception request.\" Some reasons why you may need us to make an exception include: therapeutic contraindications; history of adverse effects; expected to be ineffective or likely to cause harm (physical, mental, or adverse reaction). To facili tate a thorough and prompt review of an exception request, we encourage the provider to include additional supporting clinical documentation with their request. This may include: Clinical notes or supporting clinical statements. The name and strength of formulary alternatives tried and failed (if alternatives were tried) and specifics regarding the treatment failure, if applicable. Clinical literature from reputable peer reviewed journals. References from nationally recognized and approved drug compendia such as American Hospital Formulary or Drugdex\u00ae; and References from consensus documents and/or nationally sanctioned guidelines. Providers may call, fax or mail relevant clinical information, including clinical references for individual patient consideration, to: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Pharmacy Operations Department 25 Technology Place Hingham, MA 02043 Phone: 1 -800-366-7778 Fax: 1 -800-583-6289 We may also use prescription claims records to establish prior use of formulary alternatives or to show if step therapy criteria has been met.
