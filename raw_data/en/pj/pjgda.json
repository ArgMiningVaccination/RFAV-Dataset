This represents around a 6% of the UK population or 1 in every 16 people. Some people living with diabetes use complementary or alternative therapies to treat or manage their diabetes. Some of these therapies may be effective and others can be ineffective or even harmful. Patients who decide to use complementary and alternative medicine should seek advice from their health care providers first. Some of complementary and alternative medicine therapies are discussed below. [Chinese/Herbal Medicine](#Chinese) [Colour, Music and Therapy](#Colour) Chinese/Herbal Medicine and Diabetes Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an ancient form of treatment that is gradually gaining acceptance in the western world. It may be used by qualified professional practitioners who have trained in the therapy and are affiliated to The Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine (RCHM). To ensure treatment by an appropriately trained and bona-fide herbalist, prospective patients are advised to use the RCHM's most up to date list of [practitioner members](http://www.rchm.co.uk). Herbal medicines are those with active ingredients made from plant parts, such as leaves, roots or flowers. However, being 'natural' doesn't necessarily mean they're safe for you to take. - Herbal medicines, just like conventional medicines, will have an effect on the body and can be potentially harmful if not used correctly. - They should therefore be used with the same care and respect as conventional medicines. - If you're consulting your doctor or pharmacist about health matters, or are about to undergo surgery, always tell them about any herbal medicines you're taking. Claims of Chinese medicine This therapy is often used in conjunction with acupuncture and based on several different principles and herbs, the treatment can be effective for diabetes sufferers in some instances. TCM experts claim that the treatments must commence at an early stage in the development of diabetes to maximise its efficiency. TCM must be used carefully to complement existing conventional medical aid, it should not be used as a replacement for conventional treatment. There is not enough scientific evidence to suggest that Chinese medicine can help prevent or manage type 2 diabetes. Who should avoid herbal medicines? Taking an herbal medicine may not be suitable for: - people taking other medicines - people with serious health conditions, such as liver or [kidney disease](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Kidney-disease-chronic/Pages/Introduction.aspx) - people due to have surgery (see below) - pregnant or breastfeeding women - the elderly - children - as with as with all medicines, herbal medicines should be kept out of sight and reach of children The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulation Agency (MHRA) points out that the standards of these medicines can vary widely, and that these products have not been assessed by the MHRA for quality and safety purposes. Evidence for the effectiveness of herbal medicines is generally very limited. Although some people find them helpful, in many cases their use tends to be based on traditional use rather than scientific research. Acupuncture is a treatment derived from ancient Chinese medicine. Fine needles are inserted at certain sites in the body for therapeutic or preventative purposes. It is used in many NHS general practices, as well as the majority of pain clinics and hospices in the UK. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides guidelines for the NHS on the use of treatments and care of patients. Currently, NICE only recommends considering acupuncture as a treatment option for: - persistent lower back pain - chronic tension-type headaches - migraines Ayurvedic Medicine Ayurvedic medicine, also known as Ayurveda - is one of the world's oldest holistic (whole-body) healing systems. It was developed thousands of years ago in India. It is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Is Ayurvedic medicine safe? Ayurvedic medicine uses a variety of products and practices, some of these products may contain herbs, minerals, or metals and may be harmful, particularly if used improperly or without the direction of a trained practitioner because some herbs can cause side effects or interact with conventional medicines. - Several studies have linked Ayurvedic medicine and diabetes in a positive light, however, there are not enough well-controlled clinical trials and systematic research reviews to prove that the approaches are beneficial. Ayurvedic medicine for Diabetes Common Ayurvedic treatment concentrates on a multidisciplinary approach to diabetes, the first being intense modification of the diet, in which sugar is eliminated and simple carbohydrates are replaced by complex carbohydrates. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist for advice before trying any herbal products. Dietary Supplements and Diabetes - What are dietary supplements? \"Dietary supplements contain vitamins, minerals, herbs or plant material. They can be found in pill, capsule, tablet or liquid form and are used to supplement (add to) the diet, but they should not be considered a substitute for food,\" World Cancer Research Fund Who takes supplements and why? According to research by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in 2008, nearly a third of people in the UK take some vitamin, mineral or dietary supplement on most days. The main reason we take supplements is for our general health and wellbeing. Certain supplements such as [Vitamin D](http://www.diabetes.co.uk/food/vitamin-d.html) offer a number of health benefits, and there is some evidence to suggest that some could be beneficial for people with diabetes. Are any dietary supplements for diabetes effective? - There is some but not enough scientific evidence to suggest that any dietary supplements can help prevent or manage type 2 diabetes or its complications. Side Effects and Risks - There are multiple case reports linking dietary supplement use to kidney disease, which is of particular concern because diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. There are many reliable sources of information about supplement, such as NHS Choices, the Food Standards Agency, and the MHRA. Aromatherapy and diabetes Aromatherapy is the practice of utilising essential oils to improve the condition of the mind or body. There are no good quality studies which found that either type1 or type2 diabetes can be cured using aromatherapy. That said, there is plenty of evidence that aromatherapy can improve diabetes management, primarily in an emotional sense. There is strong evidence that suggests aromatherapy can reduce diabetes related stress and it may help ease symptoms of depression, for instance. Similarly, aromatherapy may reduce infections, which in people with diabetes are often harder to shake. Essential oils are most useful for people with diabetes when used in conjunction with other treatments, such as massage therapy. As with all new [treatments](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/treatment.html) for diabetes, you should consult your GP and diabetes healthcare team before using aromatherapy to help with diabetes. Can aromatherapy be used to treat diabetes? As described above aromatherapy is something which people with diabetes can consider. Aromatherapy cannot cure diabetes, and the evidence that it improves glucose tolerance when taken orally is somewhat limited. It can never replace the need for more conventional diabetes treatments, such as insulin in people with [type 1 diabetes](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/type1-diabetes.html). Relaxation therpy and guided imagery Relaxation therapy can take many forms. Learning how to manage stress and relax the body and mind can be a fundamental part of managing chronic diseases such as diabetes. Guided imagery, sometimes called visualisation, can profoundly affect the state of a patients mind. It is thought that those people who have an optimistic, bright outlook on life will also remain in [better health](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/healthy-lifestyle.html). Guided imagery teaches the patient the skill of creating a mental image. In the case of diabetes, this mental image would reflect the patients own perception of his or her diabetes. The reactions to this image are then explored and discussed with a therapist who helps to change the image of the disease for the better. Guided imagery can be used in the treatment of a number of chronic conditions including stress and depression but scientific evidence for its effectiveness is lacking. Massage therapy and relexology Massage therapy could be incorporated into relaxation therapy, but it also serves another purpose that can be particularly useful for people with diabetes. Kneading carefully By skilfully kneading the body's tissue, massage can stimulate better blood movement around the body. Improved circulation of this tyoe may help [diabetic neuropathy](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-complications/diabetes-neuropathy.html) and other diabetes-related complications. Consult your health team Once again, it is suggested that you consult closely with your healthcare team before using massage therapy as a diabetic, even for relaxation purposes. Reflexology is a form of massage based on a number of bodily reflex points. Homeopathy Homeopathy is a type of treatment that is entirely based on the use of highly diluted substances. The homeopathic approach is based on the concept that 'like cures like' - in other words, that \"an illness can be treated with a substance, taken in small amounts, that produces similar symptoms in a healthy person\" Is it helpful for diabetes? Despite there being extensive research into the effectiveness of homeopathy, the NHS states there is currently \"no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for any health condition\" Before you decide to use homeopathy therapy to help manage type 2 diabetes, consider these steps: - Many herbal and complementary therapies sold in shops have not been tested and they are not regulated in the same way as prescribed medications. - If you are taking any herbal or complementary remedies, it's important that you speak to your healthcare team and continue to take your diabetes medication. - There may be risks associated with taking supplements, because they affect the way your diabetes medications work, and make diabetes complications (eg kidney disease) worse. Staying safe Currently there is no known cure for diabetes, so any claims that herbal remedies can cure the condition are not supported. Remember that phrases such as 'natural', 'herbal' and 'derived from plant' do not Biofeedback Biofeedback is grounded in mind-body medicine: the principal that we can affect the health of our body through the power of our minds. . Biofeedback uses a specially designed machine that records muscle contractions and skin temperature using sensors. Using this machine, you can begin to learn the basic principles of controlling your body. Researchers have found that people using biofeedback therapy reported improved mood and sleep quality. However here is not enough conclusive evidence that biofeedback improves the care of diabetes and so it cannot be recommended.
