But few want to be old. Because age means decay, limitations, disease. But does it have to be this way? Or can we grow very old and still retain good health? \"The first person who'll turn 150 years old has probably already been born,\" say some scientists - and they should know. Because they're tackling the root cause of the problem: not age-related illness, but the aging process itself. But what's the secret of long life without aging biologically to the same extent? In telomeres, the ends of chromosomes, which are longer in Costa Rica centenarians than in other people? Is it enough to zap what are known as \"zombie\" cells, present in all of us? At least scientists are now able to measure our biological age regardless of our actual age in years. An invention by one of the gurus of longevity research Steve Horvath has made that possible. Instead of: \"How old are you?\", will we soon be asking: \"What age does your biological clock show?\" It's not implausible. We've already got a first app, devel - oped in Hong Kong, promising to \"protect\" us from aging. And there are young biohackers such as Nina Khera from Boston, who want everyone to benefit from such research. If it's possible to delay human aging one day, how about reversing the process altogether? Greg Fahy is conducting research in California on the thymus gland. His initial study on humans showed that by taking certain medication, they shaved an average two-and-a-half years off their age. The race to crack the human longevity code currently resembles a scientific goldrush, with researchers competing for fame and investors' favor. It's quite possible that scientists may soon begin to realize humanity's age-old dream of eternal youth. They have already moved beyond the ongoing debate on the many social and economic implications of extending certain people's lifespans. 284941 Documentary, 01 x 52 min.,2021, 4K;Arabic, English, German, Spanish 284942 Documentary,01 x 45 min.,2021, 4K; Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE Reaching for the StarsSCIENCE 264898 001 Apollo Astronauts - The Best of the BestNeil Armstrong was the first man to set foot on the moon in 1969.

The stars have always fueled humanity's desire for knowledge. Space missions and sophisticated telescopes that reveal distant galaxies, black holes and exoplanets have enabled many groundbreaking insights into fundamental phenomena. Physics, chemistry and biology have all benefited as a consequence. Many technological achievements can be traced back to developments in space travel. During the Cold War the Soviet Union and the United States sparred to claim milestones such as the first satellite in space and the first manned moon landing, but nowadays many teams work together on an international level. Key projects include research into earthlike celestial bodies, manned missions to Mars and the quest to find natural resources in space. 264898 Documentary, 17 x 30 min.,Arabic, English, Spanish 12 x 30 min., Portuguese, RussianSCIENCE 264898 008 Rendezvous for Peace - The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project It was a historic moment when in 1975 a Soviet and an American spaceship met in space.

Human eyes can differentiate between more than seven million colors. Human skin has thousands of sensors that detect sensations and relay information to the brain. The human brain can store the same amount of information as 20,000 dictionaries. All these statistics show that the human body is quite rightly regarded as a miracle. And not all human capabilities can be expressed in numbers. 264781 002 The Ego... What is it?Is human consciousness just a neurochemical process? If so, what does that mean for the idea of free will or the human subject or self? Does modern brain research show that it is not the self that decides what we think and want, but rather chemical and physical processes in the neurons? Some philosophers reject such theories. They point to the impact that consciousness can have on the nervous system, for example in the case of the placebo effect.

It is the point where all information from the body and its environment is collected and processed into reactions and memories. Everything we think, say or do is controlled by the brain, as are processes that occur without our conscious input, such as understanding what we are seeing or hearing, feeling joy or fear, or recognizing danger.

Sometimes, after someone has broken the law, he or she might say, \"I don't even know why I did it.\" We tend to think that is just an excuse because we humans are in fact always in charge of our actions. But neurologists see it differently. Not only have they discovered that this assessment is way off the mark, they have also found out why some people commit serious crimes. These findings are forcing society and the judiciary to rethink how to call criminals to account and punish them; but also how to help them find their way back to leading a normal life again.

Time pressure and too much work can make people ill. Studies show that multi-tasking is ineffective and inefficient: The more tasks someone takes on, the slower he or she becomes and the more prone to making mistakes. Have we reached the point where our brain can no longer process the information coming its way? The answer is yes, say some neurologists, sociologists and IT experts. They recommend: Rebuild your attention span, take breaks, and insist on the right to turn off digital devices. Some go a step further and say: Rather than us adapting to the devices, it's the devices that should be adapted to our needs.

EinSteinchen explains how a theoretical journey through this kind of cosmic tunnel could provide shortcuts across the enormous distances of space.E=mc\u00b2 - the most famous formula in the world. Everyone knows it, but very few know what it actually means. This is true of most of Albert Einstein's revelations. You don't have to be a genius in physics to under-stand our program. Whether it's the photoelectric effect or the relativity of time, the virtual figure EinSteinchen will help you understand the ideas behind Einstein's work in a simple and straightforward fashion. In twelve 90-second, elaborately animated clips, the virtual whiz explains the great scientist's most important discoveries. EinSteinchen speaks directly to viewers, and makes them want to learn more about the basic principles inherent in Einstein's theories. He explains difficult concepts using amusing and fascinating examples that anyone can understand. 124666 Animation, 12 x 90 sec., 2005, SD;Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Indonesian, Macedonian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish WW, VoD, M, IFEEinSteinchen SCIENCE EinSteinchen 124665 005 The World's Fastest FlashLaboratories all over the world have been taking part in a competition to create shorter and shorter flashes of laser light. Now physicist Ferenc Krausz has broken a new barrier. He's first to produce an attosecond pulse. An attosecond is an unimaginable 0.000 000 000 000 000 001 of a second long. The technique that Krausz used is based on Einstein's prediction of stimulated emission. The great physicist's hypothesis helped lay the foundations for the development of that incredibly versatile tool - the laser. 124665 006 Juggling Ultra-Cold AtomsThough he's just 32 years old, Immanuel Bloch is already a professor of physics at the University of Mainz. He's an expert on a state of matter that was predicted by Albert Einstein - Bose-Einstein condensation. Immanuel Bloch has now taken things a step further. He has become the first to crack the Bose-Einstein condensation wave and regularly arrange several hundred of these special atoms into a glowing grid. In the future, grids like these could make up the basic elements of a new kind of supercomputer. 124665 007 Cloned Atoms Through Teleportation For the first time ever, Rainer Blatt was able to transfer the state of one atom to another. Although the process is called 'teleportation', no matter is transported from one spot to another. Instead, information leaps the gap. To achieve his goal, Blatt made use of what Albert Einstein described as the 'spooky action-at-a-distance between particles'. The discovery is a scientific sensation, even though the teleporting distances crossed up until now have only been a few hundredths of a millimeter.124665 001Nuclear Medicine: A Formula and its ResultsWhen an atom in a radioactive element decays, then part of the matter that makes up its nucleus is transformed into energy. This is part of the proof that backs up Einstein's realization that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. Without Einstein's discovery that is expressed in the formula E=mc\u00b2, some later medical developments would not have been possible. Artificially produced radioactive substances known as radiopharmaceuticals play a major role in modern medical diagnostics and research. 124665 002 Satellite Navigation - Einstein's Contribution to GalileoTime is relative - in the field of satellite navigation, Einstein's theory has practical applications. In space, clocks tick differently than they do on Earth. But the accuracy of satellite navigation systems is depen-dent on how precisely the atomic clocks on board can measure time. 124665 003 The Speed of Light - Part 1: Light ResearchersAt the root of Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity is the assumption that the speed of light never changes. Einstein said that the speed of light is a universal constant, one that always remains the same no matter where you are. Is that really the case? European researchers now want to conduct an experiment in space to find out. 124665 004 The Speed of Light - Part 2: Radar SatelliteThe speed of light also standardizes the exact length of a meter. That's important for large-scale surveys like those slated to be carried out by the radar satellite TerraSAR-X. The rader satellite will begin surveying Earth's surface with an accuracy never before seen in civilian applications. The new satellite, for example, will be able to map the ongoing urban sprawl of some of the world's largest cities. 124665 Clips, 12 x 03-05 min., 2005, SD;Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, Greek, Hindi, Indonesian, Macedonian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish WW, VoD, M, IFESCIENCE 124665 011 The Search for a Theory of Everything For much of his life, Albert Einstein sought a formula that would describe and encompass all four funda-mental forces. He failed to find a unifying theory. The tunnel in Geneva is huge - and it runs in a circle that's 27 kilometers long. Thousands of scientists allover the world are waiting with bated breath for experiments to begin in the Large Hadron Collider. It's hoped that the gargantuan apparatus will be able to generate a kind of small scale Big Bang, lasting for just fractions of a second, that will recreate the conditions just after the birth of the universe. 124665 012 Time Travel Through Wormholes - Nothing More than a Dream? As early as 1935, Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen recognized that relativity theory did not rule out 'bridges' through space-time. Today, we call these hypothetical pathways 'wormholes'. Physicists nowadays admit that time travel through wormholes is at least theoretically possible, although journeys into the past or future have remained firmly in the realm of science fiction. 124665 008Cosmic Telescopes: Discovering Distant Galaxies According to a theory first put forward by Albert Einstein, a large body of mass curves space and the light that traverses it. Clusters of galaxies create what are known as gravitational lenses. Astrophysicist Joachim Wambsgan\u00df has spent years studying this phenomena in deep space. He searches and maps massive celestial objects such as galaxies that possess strong gravitational fields. These curve or bend the space around them, and force light from even more distant galaxies and objects into a curved rather than a straight trajec-tory. The process also 'bundles' the light, focusing and increasing its intensity. 124665 009 Racing down Einstein's Paths Molecules in gas and fluids tend to behave in unor-dered and random ways. This phenomenon, first identified by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown and therefore named Brownian Motion, was also of great interest to Albert Einstein. In 1905, he published his studies on Brownian Motion. Today, his findings can help researchers solve many of the problems linked to the movement of particles. 124665 010 Organic Solar Cells What a pain: the cell phone has to be charged at the mains every few days. But in future that could be rendered obsolete by a portable charging unit in a jacket. It consists of wafer-thin organic solar cells. Like conventional silicon cells, the organic solar cells convert light energy into electrical current. The principle behind it is the photoelectric effect. Albert Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his explanation of this phenomenon. TECHNOLOGYdigital The digital revolution has advanced into many areas of our lives. For most people, digital technologies are now an intrinsic part of both working life and leisure time. In many ways, they enrich our life and make it easier - for example, by making information and resources accessible, providing a diverse range of communication platforms, and taking on monotonous or dangerous jobs. Highly complex systems can now detect cancer cells in tissue samples more quickly and efficiently than ever before, or brake vehicles ahead of a potential collision. But these technologies also harbor risks. Many everyday interactions require us to divulge a huge amount of personal information - used by unknown entities to bombard us with news, marketing and political messages. The question remains: Who - or what - are the better decision-makers. Humans or machines?264940 003The Promise of AI - Paradise or Robocalypse?Chatbots that can hold witty conversations, medical systems that diagnose cancer, and autonomous machines capable of deadly force - artificial intelli - gence is transforming many important aspects of human life.

The non-profit organization allows companies that manufacture environmentally-sound forest products, primarily wood and its derivatives such as furniture and paper, to mark their goods with the FSC seal of approval. The seal is intended to reassure consumers that they can buy the products with a good conscience. But critics say the certifica - tion scheme is failing. For example, the seal is being used by companies processing illegally logged wood from primeval forests. A quarter of a century after the FSC was founded, virgin forests are still rapidly disappearing and indigenous communities continue to be displaced.

And it has undergone dramatic developments in this regard over the last 100 years. But increasing industrialization of the sector has negative consequences: it burdens the environment and replaces manpower with technology, providing fewer people with a livelihood. If these developments continue unchecked, then before long the food we eat will be controlled by large corporations, and food markets will be geared towards short-term profit - at the expense of non-renewable resources such as land and water, at the expense of the rural population and biodiversity. But this is not the only way forward. Sustainable agricultural approaches and an efficient smallholding economy can in the long term create equilibrium between food security and the utilization of natural resources.

The videos sent by phone are not professional productions; they are blurred, shaky and noisy, but they are authentic and they confront us with the daily experience of war - unofficial, personal war. The images intrude on the secure world of Europe, leaving the protagonists torn between their often idyllic new surroundings and the home and people they have left behind. Videos of bombardments or prisons burst into the picture-postcard backdrops of the M\u00fcnsterland or Saarbr\u00fccken in Germany. ISIS propaganda films pop up in a caf\u00e9. The war is suddenly close - with a face and a voice. These images and the stories are all the more moving because they reach us directly, without any professional remove. They are images of war in the digital age, and this is a film about a time in which distant realities are brought close every minute of the day - in this case painfully close.864919 Documentary, 02 x 30 min., 2019, HD;Arabic, English WW, VoD; M, IFE WORLD ISSUES Full Report 564681 090 In the Cartel's Sights - The Drug War in West AfricaWest Africa has become a transit region for drugs in recent years.

Many have experienced terrible things as refugees and live in a precarious situation in a new country. But here on the soccer pitch, they can forget about their worries for a few hours. Their laughter rings out over the field and, after scoring a goal, they all hug each other, regardless of where they come from, whether they're refugees or were born here. And where is this wonderful place? In the Lebanese capital Beirut. And the kids are taking part in 'Soccer Camp Lebanon'. Lebanon has more refuge es relative to the size of its population than any other country. Here Syrian refugees live alongside Lebanese locals and Palestinian refugees who were forced to leave their homes decades ago - sometimes in close proximity. This has created a volatile situation that requires a variety of strategies to build tolerance and mutual trust if social conflict is to be avoided. 'Soccer Camp Lebanon' , a nationwide tournament for children and young people, is an initiative of Germany's Goethe Institute and coaches at a local soccer school. Based on faith in the conciliatory power of soccer, it gives 900 youngsters from Beirut and three other Lebanese cities the chance to play soccer together, to escape from their everyday lives and gain new perspectives in the process. At training sessions in mixed teams - boys and girls from Lebanese, Palestinian and Syrian families - and a closing tournament, the children have the opportunity to explore their cultural and social commonalities and differences. Beirut Parc - Kids Seekin g Refuge in Football observes the young people and explores the impact of the soccer camp on their daily lives.

This is the rumor that has circulated ever since. Yet the presumed contract killings under the authoritarian leadership of President Alexander Lukashenko have never been proven. Now a key witness has come forward to shed light on the matter. At the time of the killings, Yuri G. was serving in a special unit of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Now he has revealed insider knowledge of the crime. He depicts the precise sequence of events, from the kidnappings to the disposal of the bodies. The former elite soldier names the culprits and admits to being an accessory to the murders.

In order to enable the Sikhs from India to make a pilgrimage to one of their holiest shrines, a \"peace corridor\" has been opened between the two countries. Sikhs constit ute the fourth largest religious community in India, but find themselves are caught between India and Pakistan, between Hindus and Muslims. The majority of Sikhs worldwide live on the Indian subcontinent. The hostile relations between India and Pakistan since partition in 1947 meant that for decades Sikhs were unable to visit their holiest shrine. Despite ongoi ng political tensions - especially concerning Kashmir - 73 years after their separation, India and Pakistan have fulfilled a promise that was made20 years ago: on the occasion of the 550th birthday of the founder of their religion,Sikhs in India can now use a new border crossing to make a pilgrimage to the mausoleum of Guru Nanak in Kartarpur, Pakistan - four kilometers behind the border. The Kartarpur Corridor was opened on schedule by the prime ministers of the two countries - albeit not in a joint ceremony. Both spoke of a new \"Peace Corridor\". The opening of the corridor on 9 November 2019, the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, was no coincidence; Indian prime minister Narendra Modi directly compared the two historic events.

AnandWORLD ISSUESOil Promises Ghana Dreams of New Wealth In 2007 oil fever gripped Ghana after one of Africa's largest oil fields was found off its coast. Hopes ran high that the newly discovered oil would boost the nation's economy and benefit the population. Oil, the lubric ant of the global economy, was in short supply. It was widely believed that wherever new oil reserves are found, they come with a promise of financial security for the people of that nation. When oil was foun d 65 kilometers off their coastline, Ghanaians immediately thought the same. The year 2007 marked a turning point for a nation in the grip of poverty. Drilling was set to begin in 2010. And it was said things were going to be managed better than in Nigeria, a country that extracts oil but has to import its fuel. The documenta ry explores the impact of the new oil industry on a sleepy coastal region where most people earned a living through fishing or rubber cultivation. What would change? Would the oil turn out to be an opportunity for a region that had been underprivileged or a curse as in the case of Nigeria? Filmmaker Elke Sasse spent more than a decade documenting developments in three small villages in Ghana. Nigerian artist Ebele Okoye, who also created the animations in this documentary, comments on the stories of local people from her own perspective.864938 Documentary, 03 x 30 min., 2020, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish VoD, M, IFE, LR WORLD ISSUESColonial Legacy Where do Africa's Treasures belong? So far, 23 objects have been returned to Namibia, although only on loan. The renowned Namibian fashion and costume designer Cynthia Schimming, who was also involved in the project, has called for the works to be returned unconditionally. Many have asked that the same be done with the Benin Bronzes, some of the most renowned and controversial pieces in the Berlin collection. These masterpieces, which once adorned the royal palace in the Kingdom of Benin (in present-day Nigeria), were plundered by British troops as part of a punitive expedition in 1897. They were then sold on the international art market; many ended up in various European museums. They have become a touchstone for whether the Humboldt Forum will really break new ground and dare to enter into a cultural exchange on a level playing field. It was recently decided that part of the collection would be restituted, but some of the Benin Bronzes will be displayed at the Humboldt Forum. The question is how to do this appropriately. For Jonathan Fine, ethnological museums today need to make it clear that Europe's history is closely intertwined with colonialism: \"I think it would be a success if we take the idea of a forum at its word and think of the Humboldt Forum, not as a place that will give us answers to our questions, but will enable us to pose questions about the past and the present and to bring in more voices, wider voices and different perspectives on what those questions mean. Only in that way, I think, can we come to an understanding and find answers for ourselves about what 500 years of European colonization has meant for the world we live in.\" The Humboldt Forum in the capital Berlin is Germany's biggest cultural project. Intended as a place of dialogue, it houses exhibitions on the history of the German capital, as well as the Ethnological Museum and the Museum of Asian Art. And indeed, the ethnological collections have been the focus of many controversial debates. Many of the objects, acquired during the colonial period, are tainted with blood. What does this mean for the Humboldt Forum exhibitions? How should such works be dealt with generally? Amidst the contro - versy surrounding looted art, the discussion about provenance research and how to curate sensitive exhibitions, we joined the head of the Ethnological Museum, Jonathan Fine, at his workplace in Berlin and on an earlier trip to Cameroon. In 2017, Fine conducted research into one of the collection's most impressive objects, a royal throne from the Kingdom of Bamum. He was searching for answers: How did it come to be in Germany? Was it a diplomatic gift to the German Kaiser or a forced gesture of submission? Is it a case for restitution? If it were up to Cameroonian curator and art critic Bonaventure Ndikung, Germany would have to present Cameroon with an important artwork in return - as a true act of diplomacy. Another research project explores Germany's colonial past in Namibia. Official German acknowl - edgement of the Herero genocide didn't come until 2016. Many treasures looted during the colonial period are still in German museum collections. As part of the provenance project, researchers looked at the history, significance and artistic potential of 1,400 objects from Berlin's collections in cooperation with the Museums Association of Namibia. 364947 Documentary, 01 x 30 min.,2021, HD;Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE WORLD ISSUES Stolen Soul Africa's Looted Art European museums showcase their international collections with pride, but they often brush aside questions about how some of the artefacts came to be in their possession. Those stories can sometimes be brutal and bloody, particularly in the case of items plundered and stolen by European colonial rulers, for the most part in Africa. In the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of African cultural assets were brought to Germany and other European countries. Many Africans view these objects as 'stolen souls' leading a bleak existence in ethnographic museums far from home. Some German experts would still rather see the artefacts as being of 'unknown provenance'. What does the future hold for these works of art? Shouldn't African nations have control over their own cultural heritage? Artefacts in the spotlight in recent years include priceless bronzes from Nigeria, an ornate ship's prow from Cameroon and the Witbooi Bible from Namibia. Will these objects find their way back home from Germany? Why is it so difficult to liberate Africa's 'stolen souls'? Young Africans say it is important for them to reconnect with artefacts of such significance in their cultures. 884939 Documentary, 01 x 45 min., 2020, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEWORLD ISSUES They Called Them \"The Children of Shame\" A Tale of Prejudice and Propaganda Around 100,000 French troops were sent to occupy Germany's Rhineland region in 1920. About 20,000 of these soldiers came from the French colonies of Tunisia, Morocco, French Indochina, and Senegal. The African troops became targets of a harass - ment campaign called \"Die Schwarze Schmach,\" or \"The Black Disgrace.\" German political parties, the media, and many organizations tried to discredit French occupation policies by falsely claiming that black French soldiers were systematically raping German women and children. The presence of black, North African, and Asian troops in Germany was depicted as a threat to the \"German race\" and the future of European civilization. Between 1919 and 1928, several hundred mixed-race children were born in Germany's Rhineland region - the product of liaisons between local women and French occupation troops. These children, their mothers, and extended families were socially ostracized from the very beginning. In the 1930s, these children became victims of racist Nazi policies. In 1937, Adolf Hitler secretly ordered hundreds of them to be forcibly sterilized. A special unit of the Gestapo was set up to carry out this task. This documentary, directed by Dominik Wessely, tells the story of a forgotten crime. It also explains how propaganda and toxic \"fake news\" reports can create an environment in which horrific crimes can be committed.884943 Documentary, 01 x 52 min.,2021, HD;German VoD, M, IFE, LR WORLD ISSUES 884903 Documentary, 01 x 45 min., 2018, HD;Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEJudith Kerr, Aeham Ahmad, Saa Stanii, Nneka Egbuna and Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta come from four different continents and have one thing in common: They all fled war, hardship or persecution and started over in a new and unfamiliar place.

In the short-term, it improves performance and concen - tration and dulls anxiety, appetite and sensitivity to cold.

It openly details his political agenda, fomenting hatred of the Jews and threatening war. Most of his opponents dismissed it as mere propaganda. In Germany, that only changed after he seized power.

Renowned directors, some of them refugees from the Nazis, dedicated themselves to documentaries and filmed on the frontline.

It was incumbent upon the German commander of the city, General Dietrich von Choltitz, to carry out this order. He had already played a role in the extermination of the Jews in eastern Europe. Nevertheless, he defied the orders of the F\u00fchrer, and became known as the Nazi general who spared Paris. But what do the facts tell us? Did von Choltitz have the military resources to carry out destruction on such a massive scale?

The annihilation of those they deemed inferior was just as much part of the grand plan as the establishment of homes for the birth and post-natal care of \"racially valuable\" and \"genetically healthy\" children, some of them the product of extramarital relationships between women and members of the SS. These children would be taken away from their parents and raised by families who were adherents of Nazism. The long-term goal was the formation of a kind of Nazi elite. The homes were run by an association called \"Lebensborn\", or \"Fount of Life\". More than 20,000 \"Lebensborn\" children were born in Germany and other European nations between 1936 and the end of the war. Their fate bears tragic witness to the Nazis' inhumane ideology.

Thanks to a Russian interpreter and a German dental assistant, both of them women, the Soviets were able to iden-tify Hitler's remains.

This assault by National Socialist Germany, which contravened interna-tional law, began on 1 September 1939 when German troops entered Poland without warning. It ended on 6 October that same year when the last remaining Polish forces capitulated. The commonly accepte d theory is that the war began when the German warship Schleswig-Holstein shelled a Polish garrison on the Westerplatte peninsular in the city of Gdansk. In fact, however, a German air force bomber squadron had already reduced the small Polish town of Wielun to rubble. The town's unsuspect ing residents were taken by surprize as they lay sleeping in their beds. Wielun was a town without any military presence or strategic importance. It was almost completely destroyed in three bombardments. Hitler's Assault is wi thout precedent in television history. It is the first German-Polish co-production to document the events that started World War Two. The bombing of Wielun forms the dramatic framework of the film, which is told from both sides - German residents of the border region and soldiers on the one hand, and Polish eyewitnesses on the other. 70 years on, they talked about their personal recollections of how the war began.

The divergent ideologies, interests and goals of the former allies, temporarily suspended in the battle against the Axis powers, became all the more evident after victory was sealed. Barely two years after the end of WWII in 1945, two politically and economically distinct blocs faced each other, led by the two superpowers the US and the Soviet Union. The conflict was called the Cold War because the NATO and Warsaw Pact all iances were not engaged in direct combat with one another. The battlefields were propaganda, esp ionage, the arms race and numerous proxy wars. The economic implosion of the Soviet Union heralded the end of the Cold War. The collapse affected dependent communist dictatorships and eventually brought d own the entire socialist bloc. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 is a powerful symbol of this historic turning point. But we are still far from kn owing everything that happened during the Cold War. In the bitter wran-gling, both sides resorted to dubious means, some of which are still classified or unknown to this day.

They were among the most successful painters of the 16th century, working as court painters and immortalizing Martin Luther and the Reformation in their paintings. They also ran printing workshops, were paper wholesalers, had a pharmacy license and were mayors of the renowned university city of Wittenberg. In Cologne, the Cranachs' work is being digitized - a treasure trove for professionals and art lovers. The Cranach Digital Archive (CDA) makes it possible to zoom in on even the tiniest figures or the fine networks of cracks in painted faces. Our film follows in the Cranachs' footsteps and provides an insight into the lives, work and times of the famous family of painters. With its 17,000 islands, 800 languages and 300 ethnic groups, Indonesia is a nation of superlatives. And one that is still searching for a common identity. After 350 years of Dutch colonial rule, decades of regional independence wars and a military regime that cost the lives of a million people, the country has yet to look its past squarely in the eye. For many years, a number of courageous writers have been agitating for this process to begin, by tackling subjects that still remain shrouded in silence: As a student in the 1990s, Linda Christanty from Jakarta joined the movement to topple Suharto. Azhari Aiyub from Banda Aceh writes about the region's past struggle for liberation and coping with the aftermath of the tsunami. Oka Rusmini lives on the island of Bali.

If megacities are to be in a position to tackle the challenges represented by overcrowding, overburdened infrastructure, energy provision and climate change, appropriate structures need to be established. Whatever is planned or built today will determine whether cities will be good places to live in the future or whether they will collapse under the strain. The series shines a light on innovative architectural and urban-planning projects in New York, Tokyo and Singapore that can be considered exemplary responses to some of those challenges.003Singapore: Embracing NatureSingapore is arguably the world's most modern metropolis. The small island state with a growing population needs to plan land use and construction carefully. It is committed to sustainable develop - ment and to maintaining the city's greenery. The climate is tropical, so ways to keep buildings cool and cool open spaces are a priority. Singapore has become a pioneer in eco-friendly energy-saving urban development. The regulations are stringent: any green space lost when a new building goes up must be replaced somewhere else - for example on the fa\u00e7ade or on the roof. The city is creating a new generation of green skyscrapers that harvest rainwater and run on solar power. Interview partners include:Sou Fujimoto, Sou Fujimoto Architects Kenneth A.

Its buildings have been getting taller and taller. Many buildings from previous centuries need to be upgraded or replaced. The infrastructure is also severely strained. So large-scale eco-friendly redevelopment is on the cards, as is the creation of neighborhoods that are pleasant places to live and work. New York will need to stand its ground as cities compete for the best and the brightest. 002 Tokyo: The Urban Village ConceptThe Greater Tokyo Area is the world's most populous metropolitan region, and it is continuing to grow at a fast pace. The cost of housing is astronomical. This forces hundreds of thousands of people to commute long distances to work; their daily travel time can be several hours. Urban-planning solutions are urgently needed to prevent Tokyo from choking on its own growth. Strategies include raising density, promoting shared housing and micro-homes, and investing in 'urban villages', neighborhoods where people can live, work and spend their leisure time. That would reduce the number of commuters and improve the quality of life.284937 Documentary, 01 x 90 min.,2020, 4K;Arabic, English,Spanish min.,2019, HD;English, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE 384912 Documentary, 02 x 52 min.,2019, HD;English WW, VoD, M, IFE 384911 Documentary, 02 x 45 min.,2019, HD;Arabic, English, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEBerlin is home to an outstanding treasure trove, the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.

They are places to find shade and to rest, places for families and friends to gather. But the typical features of such gardens were developed much earlier: 2,500 years ago, the kings of Persia commissioned magnificent palace gardens, bursting with fragrant flowers and shrubs, cooled by watercourses, pools and fountains, and surrounded by high walls. Pavilions and trellises provided shade and dappled sunlight. The kings' engineers created underground channels to bring water from faraway sources. These palace gardens stood in stark contrast to the arid and inhospitable landscape that surrounded them. With their symmetry and opulent vegetation, they were seen as ideal images of nature. It is no coincidence that ideas of para - dise in Judaism, Christianity and Islam were informed by such gardens. Whether on a grand scale, as the imposing park of a ruler's palace, or on a more modest scale as the courtyard of a merchant's house - this kind of garden spread, along with Islam, to the Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia, North Africa, Spain and the Indian subcontinent. While remaining true to its basic principles, it developed in different ways in each region. The gardens in Morocco's oases and coastal towns are often embellished with splendid architectural elements, colorful ceramics and decorative metalwork. In India, under the Muslim Mughal emperors, many impressive parks were laid out, with huge ornamental pools. One famous example is at the Taj Mahal in Agra. In medieval Spain, horticulture flourished during the era of Moorish rule: For centuries, the opulent palace gardens of the Alhambra in Granada were also an inspiration to architects of Christian rulers. And in Arabia, the planners of public parks adhere to ancient tradition to this day: Fountains and streams with rippling water, trees that provide shade, and aromatic herbs are seen as indispensable features in spaces that offer the inhabitants of densely built-up cities relief from the heat and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. 364893 001 Persia - The Fount of Paradise 364893 002 Morocco - Artful Beauty 364893 003 India - Harmony and Magnificence 364893 004 Andalusia - The Moorish Garden as Leitmotif 364893 005 Arabia - Parks and Gardens for the 21st CenturyThe Search for Perfection Islamic Garden DesignCULTURE 384925 Documentary, 01 x 90 min., 2018, HD;English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE 384902 Documentary, 03 x 60 min., 2018, HD;Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEWhat do escalators in Medell\u00edn, Arabic lettering in Amman, story-telling furni - ture from London, urban farming in Detroit and a co-living complex in Tokyo have to do with the Bauhaus? The architect W alter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Weimar in 1919. He brought together some of the most illustrious artists in Europe to create a school that would fuse the fine arts and the crafts. Together, they set out to fundamentally rethink the world and society. Although the Bauhaus school - which later relocated to Dessau and then to Berlin - only existed for a few years, it revolutionized ideas about the organization of modern life. In 2019, the Bauh aus will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding. To mark the occasion, planetfilm has produced a series of three documentaries for Deutsche Welle. The films focus on the influence that the philosophy of the Bauhaus movement still exerts on the globalized society of the 21st century. They also explore historical parallels between 1919 and the present day: Society is facing major upheavals and challenges, just as it did back then. We meet archite cts, urban planners, designers and artists from around the globe who, in the spirit of the Bauhaus, want to rethink and change the world. Tatiana Bilbao, for example, is a Mexican architect who has designed an 8,000-dollar house for the poorest members of society. The designer Ahmed Humeid is working on plans to bring order to the traffic chaos of the Jordanian capital Amman. How and where will the world's burgeoning population live in future? Minimalistically and collectively in tiny spaces, as the German architect Van Bo Le-Mentzel envisages it? Or maybe even on Mars? British star architect Sir Norman Foster has drawn up designs for a settlement there.

A select group of Greek soldiers were hiding in its belly. Once they'd crept out, the soldiers opened the city gates allowing the Greek army access. It's a fable familiar to many.

The striking build - ings of the modern era are characterized sometimes by structural achievements or the innovative use of materials, sometimes by a special language of form. In view of such architectural variety, it is impossible to talk in terms of a pan-European style. Yet constants and popular stylistic devices can be identified. In postmodern architecture everything seems possible: from geometric cubes to organic domes, from neo-classical stylistic creations to futuristic constructions.

The cross unites two irreconcilable opposites: a deeply cruel death and divinity. It refers to the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is at once bleak and a symbol of hope. For 2,000 years, the cross has been the symbol of Christianity. And its message is a deeply moving mystery. 564675 117 The Monks' Legacy - On Reichenau IslandA thousand years ago, the Benedictine abbey on the island of Reichenau was a center of scholarship.

He was the very first pontiff to do so in the island's history and his visit marked a thaw in the Communist regime's relations with the Vatican. In the optimism those days ushered in, the small Catholic parish in Guiteras, a suburb of Havana, planned to build a church. But it never got off the drawing board. Not until Pope Francis re-ignited the community's hopes and aspirations when he visited in 2015. 564675 125 The Miracle of Flores - The World's Largest SeminaryThe churches of Europe are pretty empty generally.

Oberammergau has kept its word for more than 400 years. But in the end, the village that the plague made famous had to bow to the corona pandemic.

Steele is not even a dangerous area; the crime rate has been dropping steadily over the past ten years. But now these so-called militias have also started threatening anybody opposed to them - on the Internet and in public. For they are being met with courageous opposition from a counter-group calling itself \"Steele Stays Mixed.\" Residents, churches, clubs, political parties and unions have united to protest either in silent marches or with singing against the far-right. 564675 134The Cup and the Covenant - Wine and CatholicismWine has been part of civilization for more than six thousand years. On religious holidays and on the Sabbath Jews pronounce a blessing over cups of wine. For the ancient Greeks and Romans wine also had symbolic significance; it was poured out in libations to the gods. The Book of Genesis names Noah as the first winegrower. After rescuing humans and animals during the Great Flood he is said to have planted the first vines on Earth. The parables that Jesus of Nazareth told are full of references to vineyards, grapevines and wine. The Catholic Mass, a religious commemoration of Jesus' death and resurrection, is based on his actions during the Last Supper, when the savior is said to have taken wine, blessed it, and given the cup to his disciples saying, \"Take this all of you and drink from it. This is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant . . .\" In this report we take a look at the cultural and spiritual significance of wine in the Catholic tradition.

Documentary, 30 min., 2012, SD; Arabic, English, Spanish; LR PLACESExploring Germany Germany is one of the world's top travel destinations. It boasts not only outstanding natural beauty, but also a huge variety of historic sights and places of interest. The \"nation of poets and thinkers\" is also the homeland of inventors and composers, explorers and monarchs who have left their mark on German culture. Retrace their steps and you'll see many magnificent buildings and learn a great deal about the history of Europe along the way. Germany's most recent history is represented by, for example, the remains of the Berlin Wall, a symbol of the East-West divide. Away from major cities such as Munich or Berlin, special vacation routes guide visitors to interesting and beautiful places across the country. 564842 003Munich - Bavarian Metropolis with TraditionMunich's contemporary role may be to host big names in the technology and automobile sectors, but the city can also look back on a long and vibrant history. The kings of Bavaria put their stamp on their capital with many imposing buildings and institutions, including world-renowned museums. Munich is also famous for its annual Oktoberfest or beer festival, which is now the largest public festival in the world. 564842 004 Experiencing History - German Division, German UnityFor a taste of communist East Germany and the peaceful revolution that brought it to an end in 1990, one should visit Leipzig, where the revolution began with a series of mass demonstrations, and of course Berlin. The eastern part was the capital of the GDR, the western part enclosed by the Berlin Wall. A visit to Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt is also fascinating: it was planned as a model socialist city. The once fortified inner-German border has since been replaced with peaceful nature reserves. 564842 005 Tourist Trails - Following Popular Themed RoutesGermany has more than 150 special vacation routes. It's a good way to gain a more profound understanding of a particular subject or region. The Castle Road, for example, runs past magnificent palaces and castles, some dating back to the Middle Ages. This edition also features the German Wine Route, the Coal, Steam and Light industrial trail, the European Route of Brick Gothic Architecture, and the German Alpine Road. 564842 006 Wintertime - Snowscapes, Winter Sports and ChristmasWinter holidaymakers flock to the many ski resorts in the mountainous regions of Germany. One of the most popular destinations is the Zugspitze, the country's highest peak. Another seasonal highlight is a visit to one of the many Christmas markets, such as the Striezelmarkt in Dresden. A region with a distinctive traditional flavor is the Erzgebirge, where craftspeople have been making toys and Christmas decorations for many generations.564842 001Berlin - A Constantly Changing CapitalTo this day, the character of the German capital is still defined by the Berlin Wall, which divided the city into East and West. Berlin is one of the most captivating cities in the world, and not just because of its fascinating history. It has long been regarded as a multi-cultural, creative metropolis with lots of green space and a night life unrivalled for its diversity and exuberance. 564842 002 Time Travel - Retracing the Footsteps of Famous GermansWe visit some key locations in the lives of influential Germans. We go to Berlin to see sites associated with the explorer Alexander von Humboldt, including the Museum of Natural History. Then it is on to Bavaria, where King Ludwig II built magnificent fairytale castles. We also follow in the footsteps of the composer Richard Wagner, the church reformer Martin Luther and the folklorists, the Brothers Grimm. 564842 Magazine, 06 x 30 min., 2015, SD; English, Spanish VoD, M, IFE, LRPLACES 584888 Documentary, 03 M, IFEThe three-part documentary series Transoce\u00e2nica - The World's Longest Bus Journey takes the viewer through the heart of South America. The series follows a bus that travels from Rio de Janeiro to Lima. The bus trip lasts six days and covers a distance of 6,300 kilometers - a journey of superlatives. A voyage filled with contrast: from the Atlantic, it leads initially through a savannah landscape, then through the Earth's largest area of wetland, the Amazon jungle, and finally up to the Andes and the Pacific on the western side of the mountain range. The road movie affords the viewer a glimpse into the soul of South America. It shows the beauty of its nature and the pride of its people, but also some of the negatives: environmental pollution, poverty and crime. 584888 001 The Maiden Voyage: From the Copacabana to Cowboys 584888 002 Crossing Jungle, Barricades and Borders: From Brazil to Peru 584888 003 The Final Stage: Over the Andes to LimaTransoce\u00e2nica The World's Longest Bus JourneyPLACES Along the Rhine The Rhine is one of Europe's great rivers, and has long been bound up with myth and mystery. Majestic and romantic, scenic and legendary are just some of the adjectives used to describe it. The French writer Victor Hugo called it a \"noble river\". And the English landscape painter William Turner captured the essence of the romantic Rhine. No other river in Germa ny is so steeped in legend. For example, it is said that the Nibelung treasure lies on the riverbed near the town of Worms. Further north, the beautiful Lorelei would bewitch hapless sailors with her song and cause them to capsize their boats. The rock that bear her name is visited by tourists from all over the world. The Rhine not only has it s place in myths and legends, songs and poems, it also plays a political and economic role. Whereas it used to serve as a dividing line between \"arch enemies\" Germany and France, today it unites the two neighbors now perceived as the motor driving European unity. The river serves as a key transport route between the industrial cities along its course and the North Sea. Its banks are strewn with romantic towns and villages drawing tourists with their quaint alleys, picturesque half-timbered houses and countless pubs selling local wines and beers. Another attraction are the region's many castles, formerly customs posts that brought their owners great wealth and now elegant restaurants and hotels. 524830 Clips, 03 x 05 min., 2014, SD;English, German, Portuguese, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE 524831 Clips, 14 x 01 min., 2014, SD;English, German, Portuguese, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEPLACES524831 001 Konstanz 002 Basel Duisburg 524831 014 RotterdamTable of Contents CHILDREN ORDER NUMBER FORMAT RUNNING TIME Come and See My World! 764826 Documentary 33 x 30 min.

Not least due to some 60 national and international titles and international star players, Bayern Munich's current membership stands at almost 300,000. Then there are about 4,300 fanclubs and millions of fans all over the world. \"What makes this club so special, isn't winning the Champions League, it's not the titles, it's the inclusive team concept with the fans,\" says Raffael, a fan from Puerto Rico. But at the same time, few clubs manage to polarize opinion in the soccer world like Bayern, a club you either hate or love. Real Madrid once branded it \"La Bestia Negra\", a black beast that cannot be vanquished. Jaime Carrasco, a sports reporter for El Mundo says: \"There are in the world only two or three teams that have maintained such a continuous will to win over the years. Perhaps Barcelona and Madrid - and definitely FC Bayern.\" Philipp Lahm spent more than two decades \"asserting myself in the FC Bayern shark pool\", an effort that eventually earned him the captain's shirt. Why can so few players resist the call from Munich? And how was a club with such strong southern German roots able to develop such global appeal? Club President Uli Hoeness says FC Bayern is \"for many people some - thing akin to a homeland, a substitute family\". Players, coaches and fans from all over the globe explain the global \"Bayern Munich Phenomenon\".

But a form of the game was played in China some 2,300 years ago in the city of Linzi, the capital of the kingdom of Qi. The winners were awarded prizes, while the losers were flogged. Other versions of what we call football are associated with Egypt, Greece, the Roman Empire, and France. But it was in England in 1863 that the Football Association was founded which drew up the first rules of the game as we know it today. From England the sport spread throughout the world. International matches and Olympic tournaments first made soccer popular in Europe. Then, in the 1920s the game also conquered Latin America. The first World Cup tournament was held in Uruguay in 1930. In the final in Montevideo, the host nation defeated Argentina. The next two tournaments, 1934 and 1938, were won by Italy. In 1938 Indonesia became the first Asian nation to qualify for the World Cup finals. The 1950 tournament in Brazil saw Uruguay emerge as champions for the second time. Four years later the sensa - tional winners in the Swiss capital, Berne, were West Germany who surprisingly defeated the hot favorites, the Magical Magyars from Hungary.

In the years that followed, African and Asian teams made tremendous advances. With superstar Pel\u00e9 in the side, in Mexico in 1970 Brazil became world champions for the third time. Four years later the tenth World Cup tournament was held in West Germany. In the final the host nation defeated the much-fancied Dutch by two goals to one. 32 years later, Germany once again played host to a World Cup tournament - and it was one to remember. The weather was glorious, the games exciting and the atmosphere amongst the fans friendly and relaxed.

Countless people are familiar with its Ode to Joy. Beethoven com posed it during a time of personal and political crisis. He was struggling financially and as his deafness worsened, his social isolation became yet more acute. He also suffered from worsening ill-health, partly caused by his consumption of wine apparently contaminated with lead. Beethoven completed the 9th Symphony in 1824. Thirty five years after the French Revolution ushered in liberty, equality and fraternity, there was little left of these aspirations in Europe. Instead, life was marked by war and oppression. Despite the gri m context in which it arose, the 9th Symphony leaves us fascinated, moved and elated by its creativity, its power and its culmination in the Ode to Joy. More than 160 years after it was written, Beethoven's hymn to brotherhood was adopted by the European Union as its official anthem. But Beethoven's Ninth is also met with enthusiasm far beyond the borders of Europe. What's the explanation for its enduring success? What is it about this work that fascinates people all over the world? To mark the 250th b irthday of Ludwig van Beethoven, Symphony for the World travels around the globe from Europe to South America, Asia and Africa. We meet extraordinary musicians who interpret Beethoven's Ninth in new and different ways, sometimes forging ties to the musical tradition of their home countries. These musical encounters are profound and personal, yet they always draw us back to Beethoven himself and the turbulent times he lived in.684924 Documentary, 01 x 90 min.,2020, 4K;English, German, Spanish VoD, M, IFE, LR 684923 Documentary, 52 min.,2020, 4K;English, Russian VoD, IFE, LR 684922 Documentary, 02 x 45 min.,2020, 4K;Arabic, English, German, Spanish VoD, M, IFE, LRSymphony for the World Beethoven's NinthMUSIC 684933 Documentary, 01 x 90 min., 2020, HD; English, German, Spanish WW, VOD, M, IFE 684929 Documentary, 01 x 52 min., 2020, HD; English, German, Spanish VOD, M, IFE, LR 684930 Documentary, 02 x 45 min., 2020, HD; Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VOD, M, IFE 624934 Clips, 07 x 10 min., 2020, HD; English, German VOD, M, IFE, LRSarah Willis, French horn player with the Berlin Philharmonic and a well-known music educator, explores Beethoven's enduring influence in conversation with musicians and experts - among them film composer John Williams, jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, the Brazilian musician and former political refugee Chico Buarque, the multitalented Van Dyke Parks, rock guitarist Rudolf Schenker, and the director of the Vienna Musikverein concert hall Thomas Angyan.

It is said that Bee thoven changed the world. But what does that mean? Can an individual artist influence the course of (musical) history? And how do we gauge the extent of that influence? One way to find some answers might be to imagine a world in which there had been no Beethoven! How would the film c omposers of today set the mood without the nuances of instrumentation created by Beethoven in his symphonies? What would jazz be without the syncopation found in Beethoven's later works? And aren't all rock music riffs based on Beethoven's famous \"da-da-da-daaa\", the shocking opening notes of his 5th symphony? So Beethoven is c learly still with us. His works are performed around the world. He is an inspiration to artists who engage with politics.

But, tragically, he could not hear the wonderful music he created because he was deaf. The work of Ludwig van Beethoven, who was born in Bonn in 1770 and died in Vienna in 1827, brought the Viennese School to its stylistic zenith, and thereby served as a bridge between Classicism and Romanticism. For much of his life Beethoven suffered from various illnesses and was often in great pain. He died at the age of 56. For decades, researchers have tried to reconstruct the progression of his illnesses and seek clues as to the cause of his death. Analysis of strands of his hair by scientists in the US suggests Beethoven died from lead poisoning. That might also explain his deafness, mood swings and angry outbursts. But it is not clear why he should have been exposed to a lot of lead. There are also questions about the history of the lock of hair that was brought to the US for analysis. One day after Beethoven died, his friend the pianist and composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel visited his apartment to bid him farewell. Beethoven's body was laid out in his coffin. Hummel was accompanied by a young student of his named Ferdinand Hiller, who cut off the lock of hair as a memento. It was kept by the Hiller family and passed on as an heirloom through the generations. The lock came into the possession of a doctor in a small town in Nazi-occupied Denmark. Who gave him the hair? Why? Nobody knows. Half a century later, in 1994, his daughter sold it at Sotheby's in London. The two Americans who acquired it commissioned the forensic analysis, which found the level of lead in Beethoven's hair to be 100 times higher than normal.The Beethoven Hair MysteryMUSIC 604849 002 Johannes Brahms: Violin Concerto D 77Berlin Philharmonic, Conductor: Claudio Abbado, Soloist: Gil Shaham Live IFE, Orchestra & Choir, Conductor: Ton Koopman Live 2015, HD; VoD, M, IFE, LR 604849 004Gustav Mahler: Symphony No in C Sharp MinorLucerne Festival Orchestra, Conductor: Claudio Abbado Live Music, 68 56 min., 2015, HD; VoD, M, IFE, LRMusic is a language of emotions that needs no words and is understood by everyone.

Beethoven started to work on the piece in 1808 but the score was not published until four decades after his death in 1827. It soon became very popular as more and more pianos were sold all over the world. A pop version by the French pianist Richard Clayderman became an international hit in the 1970s. The identity of the mysterious Elise named in the title has eluded scholars for two centuries.

But that popularity didn't last, and his work faded into obscurity during his lifetime. Ignaz Joseph Pleyel was a student of Haydn and revered his teacher, just as Mozart had done. The latter, in turn, had high praise for Pleyel's string quartets. But Pleyel wasn't just a successful composer, he also made a name for himself as a piano builder. In the 19th century, grand pianos made by Pleyel were regarded as the best in the world. Documentary, 60 min., 2018, HD; English, Michael Nyman is best known for his film music. His biggest success was with the soundtrack to the movie The Piano. Because he rejected contemporary atonal music, he gave up composing in the 1960s and turned to music criticism. An encounter with Steve Reich led him back to composition. US composer Reich is a pioneer of a musical style that Nyman was the first to call \"minimalism\". Music written in this style consists of just a few melodies, rhythms and harmonies that are then perpetually repeated. Michael Nyman is undoubtedly the most important British exponent of minimal music.

He's considered the father of the classical symphony and string quartet and an innovator in the composition of piano sonatas and piano trios. Although he was an employee of the wealthy Hungarian Esterh\u00e1zy family for most of his life, he was a master at pursuing his own interests.

He wrote a huge volume of sacred music, some to Latin but most to German texts. This music was destined for church services at the court of the Elector of Saxony, whom Sch\u00fctz served as court conductor. But as a sideline, he also composed music to entertain his employer and the royal household. Even during his lifetime, Sch\u00fctz was revered as the \"father of our modern music\".

They offer a refreshing take on the work of one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era. \"After performing all of Schumann's symphonies you get a sense that what you learned about him at school was simply wrong. Robert Schumann's symphonic music is amazing. If you're brave enough to look beyond tradition and focus solely on the music, you'll see just how impressive it is.\" The project Schumann at Pier2 consists of two elements: a concert film and a recording of Schumann's four symphonies. The concert film Schumann at Pier2 offers a new and unconventional encounter with Schumann's symphonic oeuvre. The film stars the US-Estonian conductor Paavo J\u00e4rvi and the German Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra Bremen. The setting is Pier2, a former shipyard in Bremen harbor. Usually a venue for rock and pop concerts, on this occasion it hosts performances of Schumann's symphonies for a young audience. The film observes the orchestra during rehearsals and presents elaborately recorded performances. Paavo J\u00e4rvi explains key sections of the symphonies and talks about Schumann's life. Studio-takes show members of the orchestra playing selected passages from the sympho - nies and talking about what makes them so special. Schumann at Pier2 combines these various filmic elements - concerts, rehearsals and studio recordings - into an entertaining, informative and fascinating musical experience.MUSIC Christmas Music Johann Sebastian Bach: Christmas Oratorio The Christmas Oratorio is probably the most popular spiritual work by Johann Sebastian Bach. The composition for choir, orchestra and vocal soloists illustrates the Biblical Christmas story and was written at a time when Bach was employed as cantor at the famous St. Thomas Church in Leipzig. It is comprised of several parts originally intended for church services on Sundays and religious holi-days between Christmas and Epiphany. It was first performed in sections in the winter of 1734\u001235 under Bach's baton. Soon afterwards, the composer merged the six highly uniform parts to create the Christmas Oratorio. However, owing to its consider-able length of around two-and-a-half hours, it was rarely performed in its entirety. DW Transtel presents Bach's Christmas Oratorio, performed by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra from Amsterdam, one of the world's best orchestras, in an abridged version of 2 x 50 minutes. This versioncomprises four of the six parts which perfectly reflect the spirit and the mood of the oratorio. The entire Christmas Oratorio is borne by the joy at the birth of Christ, which finds its expression in celebratory choruses and dynamic orchestral passages, interspersed with hymns and emotional arias performed by the vocal soloists. All the while, melancholic musical allusions infuse the fundamen - tally joyful tone of the work with the knowledge of the later death of the Savior on the Cross - all masterfully interconnected by Bach in a manner that lends his music a timeless character.684914 001Christmas Oratorio, Parts I-II The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Cappella Amsterdam conducted by Jan Willem de Vriend.
