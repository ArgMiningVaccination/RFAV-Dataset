The main core program areas are agriculture (includes food safety), forestr y, public health, and water and soil quality. During the recent legislative session, a patent bill for the CAES passed and was signed by Governor Rell. Effective on October 1, 2010, this law gives the CAES scientists authority to seek patents, licensing agreements, and trademarks. Legal protection will be sought for new cultivars of strawberry and tobacco plants, which are resistant to insect pests and disease problems. Analyses of s eafood samples from the oil-spill area of the Gulf of Mexico, a collaborative effort w ith the US Food and Drug Administration, had a major impact by allowing previously closed fishing areas to be re -opened. Intensive surveys continue to monitor for the Asia n longhorned beetle and Emerald ash borer, major tree pests currently present in nearby ar eas of Massachusetts and New York State, respectively. West Nile viru s and Eastern Equine Encephaliti s viruses were isolated from mosquitoes. Research and educational progr ams are being developed to address bed bug infestations in homes, hotels, and apartmen ts. Finally, more efficient methods of controlling invasive aquatic plants in lakes and ponds have been developed to restore water quality. The older buildings located on the New Have n campus need attention. $1.26 million in state bond funding was allocated for archit ectural design for the Jenkins-Waggoner Laboratory. Other funds were secured to co rrect roofing and othe r building problems in the Osborne Library and J ohnson-Horsfall Laboratory. The CAES outreach programs and website have been enhanced to facilitate the transfer of new scientific information to the public . During this reporting period, there were 1,322,425 page views. Of these, 378,184 (29%) page views were r ecorded for CAES publications. The average durat ion of visits was about 14 mi nutes. Staff members gave 1,050 talks and interviews to civic groups and the media, and two Open House events were held to give hundreds of state resident s an opportunity to meet scientists, hear presentations on scientific advancements, see experimental plots and laboratories, and to make comments on research and public outreach programs. 6 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 BOARD OF CONTROL The management of the Station is vested in a Board of Control as specified in Section 22- 79 of the General Statutes of Connecticut.

The presenter was Dr. John F. Anderson, former Director. The Davis-Stanton Homestead is located in Lower Pawcatuck (part of the town of Stonington, Connecticut). Thomas Stanton started the first bu siness in 1654, which consisted of a grist mill and later a sawmill. Surrounding an historic mid-17 th century farmhouse are more than 300 acres of prime fa rmland, which has been cultivated for at least 355 years. This property has great hi storic value spanning thousands of years. John Davis married Sally Stanton, who wa s Robert Stanton's granddaughter, and bought the farm from the Stanton family in 1772. The farm provided hay to the Continental Army and salt pork, bacon, cider, cheese, and other products to the Stonington whaling ships. John \"Whit\" Davis began farming at the ag e of 11. He had a garden plot, pony, and a cart for his first growing season. For several d ecades, he planted several acres of Indian white flint corn, which has been passed from one generation to the next. Strong ties exist between Whit Davis and Native American tribes. Having strong interests in conservation, he has served on the Stonington Conservation and Inland Wetland Commission and has sold development ri ghts to the State of Connecticut. Today, Whit Davis and his son Larry gr ow sweet corn, tomatoes, peppers, and broccoli, but their main crops are upla nd hay and salt hay cut on the \"Continental Marsh\". The salt hay is cut during the wint er to prevent damaging the marsh. Chickens are raised to produce eggs for local farm markets. After the Century Farm Award was pres ented, Dr. Magnarelli introduced Margery Winters, Senior Educator, Roaring Brook Nature Center, Canton, who gave the Samuel W. Johnson Lecture: \"Saving our Wild Areas, One Yard at a Time\". After her talk, Dr. Magnarelli presented Ms. Winters with a cert ificate signed by Gove rnor M. Jodi Rell, President of the Board of Control, Paul C. La rson, Secretary of the Board of Control, and himself as the Director of the Station. Following the Samuel W. Johnson Lecture, Dr. Magnarelli introduced Pamela Weil, President of the Experiment Station Associates, who s poke on the activities of the Associates and invited visitors to join. The combined efforts of the entire st aff - Professional, Technical, Clerical, Administrative, Maintenance, and Farm Crew - all made Plant Science Day 2009 the successful day it was.

Krol Dr. Christina S. Robb Terri Arsenault William Berger Craig Musante John Ranciato Dr. MaryJane Incorvia Mattina, Emeritus, State Chemist Dr. Xiaolin Li (left state service Feb. 2010) FOCUS AREAS Service, research, and outrea ch activities in the Departme nt are conducted within two Focus Areas: Environmental Monitoring/Remediation Food Safety Service and research activities in each focus area are often mutually complimentary. I. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Analyses are conducted across a very wide range of sample matrices submitted to the Department of Analytical Chemistry by othe r State of Connecticut agencies, municipal agencies, police departments, non-profit gr oups, Connecticut businesses, and other departments at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES). This list is not intended to be all-inclusive. 1. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Analytical Chemistry has two long-standi ng programs with the CT Department of Agriculture involving the analysis of feed and fertilizer products. a. Animal Feeds : Analysts : Craig Musante, John Ranciato Goal : To assure products are in complia nce with stated label guarantees. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 93 Summary : This analysis served as the rationale for Station's establishment in 1875. Products for both household pets and co mmercial agricultural operations are included. Samples are collected by inspectors from the Connecticut Department of Agriculture. Analytical results are reported to Connect icut Department of Agriculture, product manufacturer, product dealer. From July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 we received no feed samples for analysis and as such, no results were reported for this period. This lack of samples was due to the retirement of the primary Feeds/Fertilizer control officer during the current reporting period. As of June 30, 2010, we have logged in 188 feed samples for analysis. These samples will be analyzed for parameters su ch as protein, fat, moisture, fiber, and micronutrients, and will be reported in the 2010-2011 Record. b. Fertilizers : Analysts : Craig Musante, John Ranciato Goal : To assure products are in complia nce with stated label guarantees. Summary : This analysis served as the rationale for Station's establishment in 1875. Products from residential and commercia l agricultural operati ons are included. Samples are collected by inspectors from the Connecticut Department of Agriculture. Analytical results are reported to Connect icut Department of Agriculture, product manufacturer, product dealer. From July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, we completed analysis of 21 samples for macronutrients, such as nitrogen, ava ilable phosphoric acid, and potash, and for micronutrients, including but not limited to, boron, sulfur, cobalt, magnesium, and iron. Deficient samples (determined according to the investigational allowances outlined in the Official Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 1 (4.7%). The small number of samp les submitted was due to the retirement of the primary Feeds/Fertilizer control officer in the current reporting period. As of June 30, 2010, we have logged in 125 fertilizer samples for analysis. These samples will be reported in the 2010-2011 Record. 2. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , FOOD AND STANDARDS DIVISION Analyses conducted by the Analytical Chemis try department for the Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) are important to pub lic safety. The results of these analyses are reported in a timely fashion and can lead to the recall of products that have levels of chemical residues deemed unacceptable by regulatory agencies. a. Pesticide residues in food : Analysts : Walter Krol, Brian Eitzer Goal : To determine concentrations of agro chemicals in fresh and processed foods from local, domestic, and imported sources offered for sale in Connecticut and to assure compliance with established tolerances. 94 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Market basket survey samples are collect ed by Inspector Ellen Sloan of the DCP. Results are published in annual Stati on bulletin available by mail and at www.ct.gov/caes . From July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010, 254 samples of fresh (156; 61.4%) and processed (98; 38.6%) samples were analyzed for pesticide residues. Beginning January 1, 2006, all market bask et samples were analyzed using the QuEChERS method, providing lower limits of detection and increased number of detectable agrochemicals (Figure 1). Pl ease see the Record of the Year 2006-2007, 2007- 2008, and the Research section below, and Station bulletins for details. Of the 254 samples analyzed from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, 178 samples (70.1%) contained a total of 562 residues. Th e three most commonly detected residues were the fungicide boscalid found was 0.122 ppm, and the average number of pesticide residues found on each sample containing residues was 3.14 in 2009 - 2010. The impact on the pesticide residue program of fully implementing QuEChERS in our laboratory is shown graphically in Figure 1 belo w. Note that both the number of residues observed and the proportion of samples with resi dues have dramatically increased. At the same time, the average residue concentration has decreased by a factor of 10. This is because the new technique allows for the dete ction of many more pesticides than the old procedure and can detect those pesticides at much lower concentrations than the older procedure. Together, these factors decrea se the average reported concentration while increasing the number of residues, number of samples with residues present and number of violations due to the finding of resi dues where there is no tolerance allowed. 050100150200250300350 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 YearNumber of Samples 050100150200250300350400450500 Pesticide Residues FoundPesticides No Pesticides Residues Found 2006 QuEChERS Program Improvements Figure 1. Pesticide Residue Data 2004 -2009 b. Peanut allergens Analyst : Christina Robb Summary - In April of 2010, we received approximately 60 samples from CT DCP to screen for the presence of peanut al lergens. The analysis is by enzyme-linked The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 95 immunosorbent assay (ELISA); funding to pur chase the analytical kits was through the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). At this time, the study is focused mainly on shelf-stable imported foods. Of the approxi mately 60 samples which were analyzed, two tested positive for peanut allergens. Although th is is not a regulatory violation, the data were turned over to CT DCP. As of the wr iting of this report, DCP regulatory officials were still determining the mo st appropriate response. c. Miscellaneous samples Analyst : Department staff From July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, 220 samples were submitted for variety of analytical requests such as identificati on of foreign material, possible product adulteration or tampering. For some samples, we rely on the expertise of Station staff in other departments. 3. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , LIQUOR CONTROL DIVISION a. Beverages/products for ethanol content Analyst : John Ranciato Goal : To provide % ethanol by volume for label registration and taxation purposes. We analyzed 68 products such as beers, wines, liquors, and wine sorbet ice cream for ethanol content. The average % et hanol content for beers, wines and liquors was 6.75, 12.3, and 34.0%, respectively. Impact - Several samples of wine sorbet ice cream were brought in by DCP inspectors for ethanol content determina tion. The label lists these products as non- alcoholic, equivalent to a % ethanol content of less than 0.5%. Initial analysis by our Department showed % ethanol content of 1% ; a clear label violat ion. The DCP inspectors communicated these findings to the manuf acturer, with the mandate that the label description be met. One m onth later, three additional samples were collected by DCP inspectors from the manufacturer and all had % ethanol conten t of less than 0.5%. b. Beverage authenticity Analyst : Brian Eitzer Goal : To determine if products offered to customers at Connecticut establishments are authentic as to brand. Summary : 29 alcoholic products were exam ined for authenticity; a small number of the products were determined as una uthentic. These results are returned to the Division of Liquor Control, who then follo w up on violations on a case-by-base basis. 4. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , PRODUCT SAFETY DIVISION a. Lead and cadmium in toys, children's jewelry Analyst : Craig Musante Summary : From July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, we analyzed 18 samples, such as crayons and toys, for lead content. In addi tion, three samples of children's jewelry were analyzed for cadmium content. 96 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 None of the items had lead over acceptab le limits. Several samples were found to contain high amounts of cadmium. However, during the reporting period, there were no regulatory levels for cadmium in these products. 5. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (DEP), WASTE MANAGEMENT BUREAU a. Analysis of PCBs (p olychlorinated biphenyls) Analysts : Brian Eitzer, William Berger Goals : To ascertain the extent of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination. Common matrices include soils, waters , oils, sediments, surface wipes. From July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, a total of 28 samples were analyzed from pre-existing sites and/or spill locations in CT. The sample collection by DEP is part of mandatory long-term monitoring of these ar eas. As such, the findings are reported to DEP for assessment of continued regulatory compliance. b. Analysis of pesticides Analysts : Brian Eitzer, Terri Ar senault, Christina Robb Goals : To ascertain pesticide concentrati on associated with misapplication or drift in support of the Fede ral Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Matrices include, but are not limited to soil s, waters, oils, sediments, surface wipes. Water, vegetation and soil samples can now be routinely analyzed for glyphosate using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/ MS). This analytical procedure was developed in our Department after be ing requested by other laboratories. Summary : From July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, a total of 112 samples were analyzed under this program. Impact : In March of 2010, we were contacted by the Emergency Response and Spill Prevention Unit of CT DEP regarding an elderly homeowner in Milford CT. The homeowner had added an old stock solution of chlordane to a squirt bottle and sprayed the material in his bathroom to eliminate ants. During that activity, the homeowner collapsed due to a pre-exis ting heart condition. Upon the advice of DEP and the CT Department of Public Health (DPH), the site had to be remediated before the couple would be allowed to re-enter the house. Wi pe samples from several locations in the bathroom were submitted on March 24 (before cleaning) and March 25 (after cleaning). We reported the results of our analysis on March 29. Subsequently, the CT DPH became concerned about potential chlo rdane contamination of the ai r within the residence. In coordination with CT DEP Pesticides Bureau, air samples were taken from two locations in the residence and we reported the results ou t within 5 days. The levels of chlordane in the house were judged to be of minimal concern and the homeowners were granted access to the residence once again. 6. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF MUNICIPAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES a. Analysis of samples from Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Analysts : Terri Arsenault, William Berger, Brian Eitzer, Craig Musante, Christina Robb, Walter Krol The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 97 Summary : The Analytical Chemistry department has a Cooperative Agreement with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conduct research and analyses related to chemical contaminants in food. As a part of that agreement, the Analytical Chemistry department has successfu lly participated in performance tests and surveillance exercises for various chemical c ontaminants on several different analytical instruments. b. Analysis of samples from for municipalities Analysts : Terri Arsenault, William Berger, Brian Eitzer, Craig Musante, Summary : From July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010, Department staff analyzed 7 samples for municipalities. This included anal ysis for pesticides in several organs from the carcass of a dead squirrel for the New Haven Health Department; in this case, relatively low levels of the pesticide me tabolites hydroxychlorothalonil, oxychlordane, and DDE were found. Several instances of fo reign material analysis in food samples were conducted for the Newtown District Depa rtment of Health, the Town of Stratford Department of Health, and the Town of Wilt on Health Department. As examples of the findings, the Wilton Health De partment sample involved a salmon sample in which our staff, in conjunction with the Departme nt of Entomology, id entified a sealworm/ codworm. The Stratford sample involved a ca lzone purchased at a local restaurant; the foreign material was identified as a lobster antenna. Last, a sample of a buoy from Indian Lake was analyzed for the Town of Orange Department of Health; the foreign material was identified as a mass of fungal hyphae, algae, and yeast. 7. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF OTHER STATION DEPARTMENTS a. Analysis for Soils- Department of Forestry and Horticulture Analyst : Craig Musante, John Ranciato Summary : From July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010, a total of 301 soil samples from various sites across Connecticut were ex tracted and analyzed as part of a Forest Health Project being coordinate d by Dr. Jeffrey Ward of the Department of Forestry and Horticulture. The soil extracts were analyzed for nutrient content, including nitrogen, aluminum, calcium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus. b. Analyses related to pollinator decline- Department of Entomology Analyst : Brian Eitzer Summary : Upon request from Dr. Kim Stoner in the Entomology Department, we determine concentrations of agrochemi cals in pollen and wax to ascertain possible relationship to bee health. LC/MS methods have been developed for lo w level detection of pesticides. See Research section below. c. Analyses of samples for Nootka tone- Department of Entomology Analyst: Terri Arsenault; for the Department of Entomology. Summary : See Research/Natural produc ts section below for details. d. Analysis of seawater samples- Department of Environmental Sciences 98 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Analysts : Craig Musante Summary : From July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010, a total of 70 seawater samples were analyzed for bromine content. This project is be ing coordinated by Dr. Joseph Pignatello of the Department of Environmental Sciences and Professor William Mitch in the Environmental Engineer ing Program at Yale University. 8. A NALYSIS OF CHECK SAMPLES Analysts : Walter Krol, Terri Arsenault, W illiam Berger, Christina Robb, Brian, Eitzer, Craig Musante Summary : Annual performance evaluation samples required by our certifying agency, Connecticut Department of Public Health, as well as annua l proficiency testing samples related to our FDA FERN work, were completed during the reporting period. Our reported results exceeded required criteria in all instances. II. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Research projects in the Department of Analytical Chemistry include applied and fundamental studies. Research is often s timulated by our service work and in turn, research results often impact service activities. 1. FOOD SAFETY Project 1 : Comparison of two methods for determination of pesticide residues in food Investigators : Walter Krol, Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer, Summary : The implementation and validation of more sensitive extraction methods for pesticides in food more accura tely reflects the residues present in food commodities. This information increases th e effectiveness of f ood safety surveillance and also more accurately informs the consumer as to the residues present in the food they purchase. An extensive comparison of our previous extraction method, the VegPrep, with the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, R ugged, Safe (QuEChERS) method is ongoing. In summary, the QuEChERS method can detect more pesticides at concentrations up to ten-times lower than previously used methods. Project 2 : Improvement to FERN methods: phyto-toxins Investigators : Christina Robb Summary : Integral to our Cooperative Agreem ent with the FDA is assessment of various FERN procedures for detecting t oxins in foods. The development of rapid, sensitive and accurate methods for the detecti on of these toxins increases the robustness of food safety and security systems in the Unite d States. This year, we have been looking at plant phyto-toxins that ar e readily available and could be intentionally used to adulterate food commodoties. One of these toxi ns is Abrin, a chemical that is present in the seeds of Abrus precatorius (or Rosary pea). Dr. Robb ha s conclusively shown that enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) ar e effective for the detection of the toxic proteins associated with this plant. Conve rsely, we have demonstr ated that LC/MS can be used to detect a non-toxic but related bi omarker molecule known as abrine (Figure 2). This approach is safer in th e laboratory, and we have iden tified the presen ce of several other compounds of interest in the extract, including one unknown. In the next year, we will be working with our FERN partners in Florida to identify this unknown. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 99 Figure 2 . Rosary pea or Abrus precatorius (left). Chromatogram of solvent extract of seeds showing the non-toxic biomarker (abrine) and other analytes of interest (left). Project 3 : Improvement to FERN testing: Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Investigators : Walter Krol, Terri Arsenault, Jason C. White Summary : As a part of our food safety cooperative agreement with FDA, we were asked to develop and validate a new sc reening method to rapidly test for oil contamination of seafood coming out of the Gu lf of Mexico starting in June 2010. As the release of oil from the Deepwater well began, large areas of commercial fisheries in the Gulf were closed. After establishing re-ope ning protocols, Federa l and state officials became concerned about the potential for a large bottleneck of samples for chemical testing. As a result, the Forensic Chemis try Center (FCC) cont acted two state FERN laboratories, the CAES Department of Anal ytical Chemistry and the Minnesota (MN) Department of Agriculture, for assistance in the development and validation of a QuECHERS (\"Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe\") extraction procedure followed by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). Within two weeks, the three laboratories (FCC, CAES , MN) reported levels of detection at or below 1 part per billion (ppb) for 15 polyc yclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); known chemical constituents of oil. The three labs also developed a total fluorescence approach to estimate total PAH contamination. Once the method was validated, the three laboratories were told to expect up to 20 samples per day for five days a week, and that the reporting of results to FDA was expected within 24 hours of sample receipt (Figure 3). Impact : The new extraction and analysis pr ocedure developed and validated by CAES and its partner laboratories has been adopted by the FDA, and the results produced by our laboratory have been used to determin e that oil contamination in specific closed fisheries are below that which cause a public health concern. As a resu lt, select waters off of Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Al abama have been reopened for commercial fishing and shellfish harvest. 100 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Figure 3. Seafood samples from the Gulf of Mexico being prepared for analysis to measure potential oi l contamination. 2. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING/REMEDIATION Project 1 : Nanoparticle contaminati on of agricultural crops Investigators : Craig Musante, Jason C. White Summary : Nanomaterials (NM) have at l east one dimension less than 100 nm and this small size results in unique prope rties not observed with equivalent bulk particles. Current nanomaterial use is ubi quitous; over 1000 NM-containing products are commercially available in areas such as electronics, health-care, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food processing. We specifically note the recent and increasing use of nanomaterials in agriculture, including pest icides and fertilizers directly applied to food crops. The impact of nanomaterials on biota has only recently been explored, and studies have included bacteria, algae, nemat odes, crustaceans, fish, rats, and humans. While these research areas are still being pursued, data have shown that in some instances, particles that are supposed to be inert can have significant physiological effects. To date, little work has focuse d on agricultural plants and the potential for particle transfer through th e food chain. This lack of understanding on NM fate and effects is disconcerting given that f ood crop contamination is a significant uncharacterized pathway of human exposure. Th is research project is seeking to define the impact of NMs on common food crops, w ith a focus on the risk posed to humans from exposure to these contaminated plan ts. In preliminary investigations using hydroponic studies, we have shown that in several instances, the toxicity of a given nanoparticle is indeed significantly greater th an that of the corresponding bulk material. In addition, when zucchini plants were exposed to equivalent concen trations of bulk and nanoparticle silver, the amount of metal that was subsequen tly found in plant shoots was on average four times greater for the smaller particles (Figure 4). Impact : Our research demonstrates that the t oxicity of nanoparticles to agricultural plant species can be significantly greater than that observed for the corresponding non- nano or bulk material. These findings have implications for the widespread use of nanomaterials in commerci ally available products. Project 2 : Phytoremediation of soils contaminated with weathered persistent organic pollutants (POPs) Investigators : William Berger, Jason C. White The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 101 Figure 4. Shoot Ag content of plants exposed to nanoparticle or bulk Ag solutions. Summary : This project illustrates the overlap of service and research activities in the Department of Analytical Chemistry. In 1990, samples from our market basket survey were found to contain chlordane re sidues, although the registration for this insecticide on food crops had long been termin ated. Our research has shown that some agrochemicals such as DDT and chlordane have measured half-lives in soil of years, if not decades or longer. Several separate lines of investigation were pursued to determine the potential of plants to remediate soils contaminated with these pollutants. a. Studies were conducted on the potentia l of certain vegetation to remove moderately low levels of pers istent organic pollutants from soil. Previous data had indicated that Cucurbita pepo ssp pepo (zucchini) cultivars have remarkable abilities to phytoextract the weathered resi dues but that significant cr op variability may exist down to the subspecies level. Studies were conducted under this line of investigation in the past year. In field experiments at Lo ckwood farm, six different cultivars of C. pepo were grown in soil containing weat hered DDE at levels of 50-300 ng/g. Three of the cultivars were from the subspecies pepo and have been previously shown to accumulate significant amounts of weathered DDE in th e roots and stems. The othe r three cultivars were from the subspecies ovifera and have been previously shown to accumulate negligible amounts of weathered DDE. During the 2007 field season, the DDE uptake abilities of these cultivars were again confirmed, but I also cr eated all possible hybrid crosses between the different DDE accumulating and non-accumula ting cucurbit cultivars. Manual pollination of female flowers began in the mi ddle of the growing season. Viable F1 seeds were harvested and planted during the 2008 field season. In addition, F1 backcross cultivars were created during 2008 and seed was planted during the 2009 growing season. The data show that the ability of the hybrids to accumulate DDE does change upon hybridization. Non-accumula ting squash that are cros sed with DDE-accumulating zucchini acquire the ability to extract the pe sticide but then lose that ability when backcrossed with the original parent. However, the converse is not true; DDE-accumulating zucchini that are crossed/pollinated with non-accumulating squash retain partial ability to extr act the pesticide (Figure 5) but do not fully re gain the capacity upon backcrossing with the original parent.

Following the inheritance patterns of the DDE accumulating abilities of F1-F3 hybrids of C. pepo will make it possible to determine the underlying molecular basis for th is unique ability. Once this is done, efforts to maximize this ability in zucchini or transfer the gene (s) to other plants will become possible. Figure 5. Uptake of weathered DDE by parental zucchini and squash, F1 hybrid s, and F1 backcrosses obtained by cross pollination. BCF is the dry weight ratio of DDE in the stem to that in the soil. b. In collaborative experiments with Dr. Om Parkash of the University of Massachusetts, molecular an alysis of DDE-accumulating and non-accumulating cucurbit cultivars that were grown in hydroponic solutions containing the contaminant at levels just under water solubility conti nued. Tissues from exposed pl ants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and subjected to a differential mRNA subtraction analysis. A colony array method for screening the differentially expressed subtracted cDNAs from C. pepo ssp pepo stem and root tissues in DDE-exposed C. pepo ssp ovifera continue to sequence these diffe rently expressed cDNA clones. A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search against plant ge ne database showed the sequence homology with 'Phloem Protein 1 (PP1)' from Cucurbita maxima and many 'novel' genes with unknown function. The PP1 protein is suspected to be involved in long distance transport of solutes and metabol ites. Further, we used semi quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to confirm the differential regulation of the putative PP1, cyt P450 and other 'nove and un-exposed C. pepo ssp pepo (zucchini) tissues. Our initial results showed that the mRNA transcript expression level for over 20 genes is increased in zucchini upon contaminant exposure (Figure 6). We are in the process of an alyzing the significan ce of these molecular changes. Stem DDE BCF 0369121518 Parental F1 hybrid F1 Backcross pepo)The Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 103 Impact: The ability to accumulate and tran slocate weathered DDE is a unique ability restricted pepo ssp pepo . Isolation of the molecular/genetic controls of this system will enable a full characterization of the remedial potential of this species, as well as potential transfer of the ge nes to plants perhaps more effective and amenable to field scale phytoremediation. c. Additional hydroponic inves tigations are being conducted to evaluate the role of aquaporins, water channels in the membranes of root cells, in providing entry into the cell for POPs. These root pores are known to transport a variety of small solutes. One way of ex amining what takes place in the aquaporin channels is to cause the channels to s hut down. The addition of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) to the growth solution co uld generate hydroxyl radica ls (*OH), which have been shown to close the aquaporin channels in othe r plant systems. In preliminary studies, a decrease in chlordane uptake by the plants exposed to H 2O2 was observed and supports the concept that aquaporins are a potential pa thway for chlordane to enter the roots of C. pepo. Project 3 : Analysis of Diquat and Paraquat in beverages and lake water Investigators : Christina Robb, Brian Eitzer Summary : We have developed a method to anal yze for polar pesticides such as diquat and paraquat. These two chemicals ar e widely used herbicides but unlike most other chemicals in this group, they have sign ificant mammalian toxicity. The analytical procedures include a new LC-MS/MS protocol for the direct analysis of paraquat/diquat in water. These compounds cannot be retained by typical reverse phase liquid chromatographic (RPLC) conditions; therefor e, we used Hydrophobic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (HILIC) stationary phase in this work. HILIC is a combination of a Figure 6. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of zucchini subtracted cDNA clones from seedlings. 104 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 polar stationary phase that is used in conjunction with a se mi-aqueous mobile phase. This combination makes an extremely mass spectro metry friendly system, and typically by changing from suitable RPLC conditions to HILIC conditions, a substantial increase in sensitivity is observed. We have spiked the chemicals into numerous beverages and shown acceptable recoveries down to 5 ppb. As an example of an extension and practical application of this new analytical method, CA ES Department of Environmental Sciences staff added diquat to Crystal Lake in Middletown CT for i nvasive weed control. We analyzed levels of the herbicide after applica tion at various locations within the lake and showed diquat persistence for up to seven days. Impact : Diquat (RewardTM) is widely used in CT for the control of invasive aquatic plants in CT but monitoring the persis tence of this herbicide in lake water was complicated by the chemistry of the molecule and the lack of a r obust analytical method. The method developed in our laboratories addresses this shortcoming, allowing both applicators and regulators to ma ke more informed decisions on the use of this material. Project 4 : 2009 Study of Crumb Rubber Derived from Recycled Tires Investigators : William Berger, Xiaolin Li, MaryJane Incorvia Mattina, Craig Musante Summary : As a part of a broad, State of Connecticut-funded study of several aspects of artificial turf fiel ds, including components, such as crumb rubber infill, the Department of Analytical Chemistry at the Station was charged with the following: (1) Develop protocols to identify comprehensiv ely substances which volatilize and leach from crumb rubber material (CRM) and al ternative infill materials under laboratory conditions. (2) Develop simulate d crumb rubber aging protocols. In laboratory studies, 11 compounds were detected in the headspace over the virgin CRM samples, although four of the chem icals were below the level of quantitation (LOQ). Six of these eleven compounds were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including the four that we re below the LOQ. The com pound released at the highest concentration is consistently benzothiazole; this chemical is typically present at ten times the level of the other constituents. Four different chemicals (xylenes and styrenes) were released from the alternate in fill products. Under simulated rain conditions, benzothiazole and zinc were the primary constituents rel eased from the CRM samples. Conversely, the alternate infill products rel eased proportionately larger amounts of chromium under leaching conditions. Over a ten-week weathe ring experiment, the amount of out-gassed volatile compounds decreased by 20-80%. A limited comparison of virgin CRM to the same product sampled from the field two y ears later showed similar compound-specific reductions in outgassing. Impact : Our findings show that although vol atile chemicals are released from virgin crumb rubber, the amount of outg assing seems to decline significantly over relatively short periods of time. These findings were included in a larger multi-agency report that can be found at the CT Depart ment of Environmental Protection website (http://www.ct.gov/dep ). With regard to the results of other agencies, the CT Department of Public Health (DPH) conduc ted a screening level risk assessment on CRM. The results indicate that in spite of worst case assump tions incorporated into the DPH analysis, cancer risks were only slightly above de minimis levels for all scenarios evaluated. This includes children playing indoors, the scenario with the highest exposure. These risks are The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 105 well within typical risk levels in the comm unity from ambient pollution sources and are below target risks associated with many air toxics regulatory programs. Project 5 : Analysis of Pesticides in Conn ecticut Pollen - Baseline Survey Investigators : Brian Eitzer and Kim Stone r (Dept. of Entomology) Summary : We are conducting research in to how honey bees get exposed to pesticides through their foraging activities. A honey bee can travel up to two miles away from its hive as it collects polle n. It brings the pollen back to the hive for use as a food. During this time, the honey bee can be exposed to pesticides used in the residential or agricultural fields from which it collects. Although all pesticides can potentially stress the honey bees, there is a particular interest in a new class of pesticides known as the neonicotinoids, as one member of that cla ss (imidacloprid) has shown significant honey bee toxicity and has been banned in several c ountries. Our study is aimed at determining the current typical background e xposure of honey bees to pest icides. We are collecting pollen from a set of honey bee hives that repr esent urban, suburban and rural locations. The pollen is being collected from the same location for a period of several years allowing us to look at time trends within the data. The pollen is brought to the laboratory, where it is analyzed by using a multi-pesticide screening technique that we have developed. The method is based on the QuEChERS procedures used in our fruits and vegetables residue work, but has had se veral small modifications to enhance the utility for pollen analys is. Over the past three years, we have found an average of 5 pesticides per sample. We have also found that the amount and numbers of pesticides vary with both time and hive location. Fo r example, in 2009 samples taken from one orchard had an average of 12 pesticide residues per sample, whereas all other samples only had an average of 5 residues per sample. Impact : Honey bees are being exposed to pe sticides. Long-term monitoring from the same hives and locations provides background data that can be used to assess trends and changes in pesticide exposure. Project 6 : Analysis of Neonicotinoid Pesticides in Flowers, Pollen and Nectar Investigators : Brian Eitzer and Kim Stoner (Dept. of Entomology), Dr. Frank Drummond , (University of Maine) Dr. Anne Averill , (University of Massachusetts) Summary : This is a new two year project th at we are participating in along with collaborators at other research institutions. We are interested in learning how much of a systemic pesticide applied as a part of a normal agricultural practi ce will be found in the pollen of the plant when it blooms. To conduct the study, we are growing crops of summer squash, cranberries and blueberries. W ithin each crop several different pesticide treatments were used. These treatments include seed treatments and foliar sprays used as directed. When the crop was in bloom, samp les of the pollen and/or flowers were taken and brought to the laboratory for pesticide residue analysis. These analyses are conducted using the QuEChERS extraction procedures followed by LC/MS/MS. Our analyses have shown that the residues of these systemic pesticides can be found in the flowers of blueberry and cranberry (nectar and pollen samples were not submitted) and in the flowers nectar and pollen of summer s quash. These data indicate the potential exposure to these chemicals by foraging bees. 106 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Impact : Knowledge of the pesticide residue levels in pollen and nectar from differing plant treatment protocols can allow us to choose a protocol that will minimize the exposure to honey bees. Project 7 : Coordinated Agricultural Pr ogram on Honey Bee Health Investigators : Brian Eitzer and Dr. Keith Delaplane (University of Georgia, Lead Principal Investigator) Summary : This is a very large multi-i nstitutional projec t (over 20 funded investigators from 15 different in stitutions) that is considering issues related to the health of honey bees and other native po llinators. These issues rela te to various pathogens and parasites (colony collapse disorder, Nosema , Varroa mites, etc.), as well as management practices. One of the threats to honey bees is use of pesticides in agricultural settings as well as within the beekeeping community. The role of the CAES within this project is the analysis of pesticide residues. These re sidues will be examined as a part of several separate research projects in cluded within the overall projec t. Pesticide residues will be examined in pollen taken from sentinel ap iaries (apiaries maintained by University researchers) on a monthly basis so that pesticide exposure can be examined as a co-factor in studies on honey bee health. Our results fr om these apiaries show that the pesticide content varies not only with sampling date a nd location but also w ithin hives from the same location and time; two hives from the sa me apiary during the same time frame can have very different loads of pesticides in th eir pollen indicating that those two hives were foraging at different locations (Figure 7). A second project is l ooking at pollen and wax from commercial beekeepers but these sa mples have not yet been analyzed. Impact : Analysis of pesticide residues from apiaries that are being intensively monitored for infectious agents and colony heal th will allow us to de termine if they are a co-factor in some of the probl ems being faced by honey bees. Project 8: Analyses of samples for Nootkatone Investigators : Terri Arsenault, Drs. Kir by Stafford and Anuja Bharadwaj (Department of Entomology) Summary : The effectiveness of nootkatone, an essential oil of grapefruit and other plants, for control of the deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ), the primary vector for Lyme disease, is being investigated. In 2008, applic ations were made in the field to track the degradation of nootkatone. Filter paper samp les were laid prior to the application and were then collected over a thre e week time period. More th an 90% of the nootkatone had degraded within two we eks of the application. In 2009, the goal was to develop a formulation that would be more persistent in the environment and thereby give better long-term control. Preliminary laboratory results showed that a lignin-based formulation would prevent the degradation of nootkatone by UV light. However, based on field data, the Nootkatone would still break down rapidly in the environment. In June of 2009, we had unusually rainy weather, and this contributed to the breakdown of the filter paper; therefore, method development work is cont inuing. In addition, this year, we showed that Nootkatone can be extracted from and de tected in both soil and foliage samples taken from the application sites. In 2010, a new nootkatone formulation, maillard soyscreen, was compared to the lignin-based formulation. Filter paper assemblies were The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 107 Figure 7. Photograph demonstrating the differen ces between hives at a single apiary. All five hives were sampled on the same day ye t the pollen collected by the bees was very different and had differing pesticide loads. put out at seven locations, applications of the two formulations were made, and the assemblies were removed over a one week perio d. The filter papers will be assayed to determine the distributio n of the applications, and the degr adation of the nootkatone. Soil and foliage samples were also collected to compare to the filter paper assay. Impact : The development and use of a pers istent and effective natural product for deer tick control will reduce human expos ure to both insecticid es and to the Lyme disease vector. PUBLIC OUTREACH Telephone/internet inquiries : We receive about 1,000 calls from the public each year requesting information on issues such as pestic ides in food and in the environment, lead in paint, food, soils, and consumer products. In some instances, we refer the caller to a more appropriate CAES Department or State agency. Station Bulletins : Station Bulletins are typically published annually by our Department. These bulletins are available in prin ted form and on the CAES web site (www.ct.gov/CAES ). They are also available at libraries throughout Connecticut. 108 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Fact Sheets : Listed on the CAES web site under \"Publications\" are several articles written for the general public regarding topics of timely a nd widespread interest, with examples focusing on issues such as wood pres ervatives, persistent organic pollutants, and removal of pesticide residues from produ ce. A limited number of articles are also available in printed format. Department members also cooperate with the Connecticut Department of Public Health in pr oducing fact sheets published by them. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 109 DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHE MISTRY AND GENETICS Protecting Honeybee hives from Am erican Foulbrood Disease: Dr. Douglas W. Dingman , assisted part-time by Cindy Musante or Regan Huntley, continued investigations on the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae: causative agent of the disease American honey bee ( Apis mellifera ). AFB is a devastating disease worldwide, causing economic losses in honey production, and disrupting managed pollination of agricultural cr ops. In collaboration with Mr. Ira Kettle (Connecticut state bee inspector) the presence of AFB was surveyed in 87 apiaries in CT. The current level of AFB (sub-clinical and clinical infections) is 46%. P. larvae isolates are being tested for resistance to Terramycin, the antibiotic used by beekeepers to control AFB. No new apiaries, beyond the five currently identified, have been found to contain tetracycline resistant P. larvae . Three types of 16S-23S intergenic have been rDNA operons of P. larvae and DNA sequencing of these regions has been completed. Genomic restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on 104 P. larvae isolates shows only three phylogenic types of P. larvae in CT. Type I and Type Ib represented 44% and 46% of the infected apia ries, respectively. P. larvae Type III has been found in only four apiaries in CT. A PCR-based genomic fingerp rinting analysis continued to show lower reproducibility and had lim ited strain resolution compared to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. This testing protoc ol has been discontinued. Several P. larvae cultures were obtained from Argentina through USDA registration and licensi ng. These cultures will be used for molecular comparison with isolates from CT. The eight cultures represent strains isolated in Argentina, Ch ile, and Czechoslovakia. The cultures do not show tetracycline resistance and have the sa me 16S-23S ITS-PCR fingerprint as the CT isolates. Investigation of a sanitation protocol for combating AFB has shown promise under \"real world\" conditions. Based on fiel d investigations, techniques have been modified to provide an easi er and more efficient appro ach. Currently, a baseline subclinical infection profile for an apiary, over the course of a bee season, is being obtained. This baseline profile will be used for comparative analysis of future sanitation tests. Database entry of all registered b eekeepers in CT for the years 2007-2009 has been completed with help from a student volunteer Reese Blackburn. Survey results obtained for all the AFB isolates are being linked to th is database for future GIS mapping analysis. A \"rough\" PCR diagnostic test has been developed for identification of Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae in samples of adult honey bees. In addition, collaborative work was initiated with Dr. John F. Anderson on the use of Lysinibacillus sphaericus and Bacillus thuringiensis for biological control of mosquitoes in storm drain catch basins. 110 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Impact American foulbrood is a bacter ial disease with th e potential to disr upt honey production and managed pollination of agricultural crops worldwide. From the approximate 3 million managed honey bee hives in th e U.S., honey sales alone produce $150-$200 million annually. Because agricultural pollin ation by honey bees contributes greatly to crop yield, pollination services return approximately $150 million annually. The annual loss to beekeepers, in equipment and bees, resulting from known AFB infections is approximately $5 million. Losses in honey sales, pollination services, and crop yields are unknown. Improved colony health through increa sed sanitation and eradication of AFB will significantly benefit beekeeping and agri culture. Loss of Terramycin as a label antibiotic for use on honey bees has severely impacted the treatment for AFB. Having an effective and easy sanitation protocol would be ve ry beneficial to beekeepers and fill this AFB treatment void. Currently, one beekeeper has plans to use the sanitation protocol. Two other beekeepers (one a commercial beekeeper) have agreed to participate in a second investigation monitoring the effectiven ess of the beehive sa nitation protocol. Genetic Regulation of Leaf Blade Development Dr. Neil McHale assisted by Regan Huntley continued work on the molecular mechanisms controlling formati on of the leaf blade in toba cco. Plant photosynthesis is carried out in the leaf blade, a highly speci alized structure with distinct cell layers performing different functi ons. The upper (ue) and lower (le) epidermis prevent desiccation but allow free gas exchange with the atmosphere through small stomatal openings. Light interception and photosynthesis occur primarily in the palisade mesophyll (pm), just below the upper epidermis. The inner layers of middle mesophyll (mm) house the vascular system that tr ansports sugars (phloem) and water (xylem). Identific ation of key genes governing blade growth would provide valuable tools for eventual engineering of crop plants with higher primary productivity. Because plants can survive without leaf blad es (stems are photosynthetically active), we reasoned that genes governing all major steps in blade formation could be identified through isolation of mutations that disrupt the process. We induced a random set of mutations in a wild diploid species of tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris) with ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) and isolated a broad sp ectrum of single gene knockouts that either compromised or eliminated blade formation. Among the most dramatic was a mutation disrupting the function of a gene named LAM1 . Loss of this function results in the failure in the development of leaf blades. Leaf blades are initiated normally, but then fail to grow outward from the flank of the primordi um. Studies with this \"bladeless\" mutant The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 111 plant revealed that blade formation occurs in two distinct phases. The first involves recruitment of a loosely organized set of blade founders, a process not requiring LAM1 . It is in the following phase, where these cells are organized into dist inct cell layers, that LAM1 function is essential. Because t echnical obstacles precluded cloning of LAM1 in tobacco, the molecular identity of this key organizing f unction remained unknown. This roadblock was recently circumve nted by identification of the LAM1 ortholog by transposon mutagenesis in alfalfa (Noble Foundation, Ardmore, OK). A wild-type copy of a gene named STENOFOLIA (STF) fully restores blade formation in lam1 mutants of tobacco, proving that they encode the same function. Using primers based on the STF sequence in alfalfa, we cloned LAM1 from tobacco, and conducted a sequence analysis showing that it is a member of the WUSCHEL- like family of transcription factors. DNA gel blots show that the entire coding region of this gene has been deleted in mutant lam1 plants. Analysis of the promoter region re vealed four elements known to function as binding sites for auxin response factor proteins. This suggests that LAM1 is a target gene regulated by the plant hormone indole acetic acid (IAA), which governs a broad range of plant functions including leaf initiation, flower formation, and root development. Our results indicate that LAM1 guides the basic patterns of IAA accumulation and transport along the margins of leaf primordia, a proce ss critical to blade gr owth and subsequent vascularization of the blade. Impact IAA is a remarkably versatile molecule, recognized decades ago as a key regulator of growth in leaves, flowers, fruit and roots of all higher plants. As population growth and climate change place increasing pressure on the global food supply, it is among the highest of agricultural priorities to unde rstand how this simple molecule works. Identifying genes critical to IAA synthesis and transport will bring the ability to manipulate the growth of virtually any edib le plant part in any crop plant. Our LAM1 gene falls in this category and is a prime ex ample of the cloned ge nes and mutant strains from our program that have influenced the direction of investig ations in many other research laboratories. Dr. Jun-Yi Yang in the Plant Molecular Biology program at Rockefeller University is using one of our transgenic strain s and our bladeless lam1 mutant has been a subject of work for seve ral years in the Plant Genome program at the Noble Foundation (Ardmore, OK). 112 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Genetic Dissection of Photosynthetic Performance in Leaves Dr. Richard Peterson in collaboration with Dr. Neil Schultes and assisted by Carol Clark engaged in studies intended to iden tify genes that control the rate of photosynthesis. This process is the prim ary means for accumulation of dry matter by plants and improving photosyntheti c performance will be an important step in efforts to increase global food production. Grasses like maize use a specialized leaf architecture and unique two cell biochemistry to capture carbon through a highly efficient C4 pathway, contributing to rapid growth and high productivity. There is intense interest in di scovering the genes involved in C4 development and regulation. In collaboration with Dr. Israel Zelitch (emeritus Biochemistry & Genetics) and Dr. Thomas Brutnell at the Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI), we are taking 3 different experimental approaches to this goal. First, a systems approach to C4 photosynthesis will lay the foundation for an extensive databank that will be used in gene identification. Samples from defined positions along a developing maize leaf (represen ting different stages in C4 development and hence gene expression) are an alyzed. Each sample represents a snap shot of gene expression (called a transcriptome) or all the proteins present in the sample (a proteome) or metabolites present in the samp le (a metabolome). Ou r contribution is to generate photo-physiological measurements for each sample, representing a physiome. By comparing different developmental samples, or generating new samples with specific perturbations, a comparative view of gene expression will help identify key genes in C4 photosynthesis. In a second approach, we are in vestigating the role of photorespiration in regulating C4 biochemistry and hence C4 ge ne expression. In the previous year, we published a manuscript in Plant Physiology th at uncovered the essential nature of photorespiration in C4 photosynthesis. It is our working hypothesis that glycolate - an early metabolite in photorespiration - is esse ntial for C4 gene expression. Through the use of an inhibitor of glycolate oxidase, th e key enzyme in photorespiration, increasing amounts of glycolate are generated and measured in maize seedling leaf samples. In turn the samples are subjected to a deep sequenci ng procedure to generate transcriptomes of gene expression. By comparing the transcriptomes of differe nt glycolate-containing leaf samples, it has been possible to identify genes that are up or down regulated. In the next series of experiments, we will verify the observed expression patterns of candidate genes through independent techniques RNA blot anal ysis or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction procedures. In a third appro ach to identifying C4 photosynthetic genes, we are leveraging the extensive diversity available among disparate maize ecotypes. Highly inbred Nested Association Mapping (NAM) maize lines obtained from BTI are subjected to a variety of se nsitive photosynthetic measurements. Differences in net photosynthesis and conductance of CO2 di ffusion through the mesophyll tissue have been observed. The significance of those re sults rests on the fact that NAM lines are constructed to facilitate genetic dissection of comple x traits such as mesophyll conductance. Application of novel genetic a pproaches are used to locate chromosomal regions carrying genes involve d in the queried trait. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 113 Impact: A substantial increase in the global food supply will be required to meet the demands of a growing world population. Among the critical re straints will be availability of water, placing new importance on development of crops th at can thrive in semi-arid conditions. Plants like maize have evolved a C4 pa thway for photosynthetic carbon fixation that allows for rapid growth and exceptional wate r use efficiency. In collaboration with scientists at the Boyce Thompson Institute, our goal is to characterize patterns of gene expression governing the development of C4 photosynthesis in maize, and ultimately transfer this unique pathway into major crop pl ants such as rice, which accounts for more than one fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Plant Nucleobase Transporters Neil Schultes in collaboration with Dr. George Mour ad (University of Indiana/Purdue at Fort Wayne) and assisted by Regan Huntley and Carol Clark continued work on molecular characterization of purines and pyrimidine transport in plants. Plant metabolites are in a constant state of flux, moving within and between plant cells and tissues. Membrane bound transporters act as metabolite-specific gatekeepers that regulate traffic of metabolites between compar tments. Because transporters are often key control points in plant biochemistry, understand ing their function is an important goal for eventual enhancement of crop productivity and im proved efficiency in use of fertilizers. We have identified a novel nucleobase transporter gene in Arabidops is residing at locus At5g03555. This locus encodes for the sole representative of the Purine Related Transporter (PRT) super family in plants, and is named AtPRT1. The microbial PRT paralogs are numerous and mainly used in savaging extracellular nitrogen sources. However, plants nucleobase biochemistry is more complex with distinct, synthesis, catabolism and recycling pathways regulating transport. Our studies have defined the function of this transporter and determined that has a unique solute tr ansport specificity. The research involved molecular and physiologi cal characterization of three Arabidopsis lines carrying independent T-DNA inserti on mutations at locus At5g03555. We probed the solute transport specificity of AtPRT1 through seed ling growth studies and found enhanced resistance to growth on toxic nucleobase analogs 8-azaguanine, 8-azaadenine and 5-fluorouracil, but no on 5-flurocytosine pyrithiamine (a thiamine analogue) 5-bromodeoxyuridine or 2-fluorodeoxyuridine, or with allantoin as a sole nitrogen source. The transport specific ity of adenine, guanine and uracil is unique for PRTs and was further verified by two alternate means. W ild type and AtPRT1 deficient plants were assayed for the ability to take up radio-labele d adenine, guanine or uracil from external media. The solute tr ansport specificity determined by this method matches the results form the gr owth studies. In addition, the AtPRT1 gene was tested in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for growth on toxic analogue s. Heterologous expression in yeast confirms the solute specificity of a novel Arabidopsis guanine/adenine/uracil transporter. We identified AtPRT1 paralogs from a number species, and 114 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Arabidopsis thaliana . Interestingly, plant genomes cont ain only one or two PRT genes, while there are numerous PRT genes in microbial genomes. Impact The movement of nitrogen and carbon-based compounds within plants is highly regulated by transporter proteins in the cell membrane . Understanding nitr ogen and carbon use patterns by plants will have important implicat ions for both basic plant biology as well as applied science. Developing plants that use fertilizer more efficientl y is just one example of how results from this research may be applied. Our investigations on nucleobase- ascorbate transporter genes in plants has an impact on a number of other research laboratories investigating similar research in terests. One example is our collaboration with Dr. Mourad on uracil transporter-encoding genes in Arabidopsis thaliana . The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 115 DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY The Department of Entomology is involved in a variety of service, research, pest surveillance, and regulatory activities. The primary service activities are provided through the Kenneth A. Welch Insect Inquiry Of fice. Staff in this office answer insect related questions and identify insects and related arthropods for the public, government agencies, growers, and business organizations. All scientists provide information to citizens of Connecticut by answering telephone inquiries, making farm visits, participating in meetings of growers and other groups, and speaking on their research. Most of the research in the Department has a major applied aspect, addressing the integrated management of ticks, pests of fi eld crops, nurseries, and orchards, and wood- boring insects. Staff members also work closely with organic farmers and landscapers in Connecticut. The Office of the State Entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, created by the Connecticut General As sembly in 1901, is part of the Department of Entomology with responsibilit y, in part, to ensure our nurse ry industry is free of plant pests and certify their products for shipment to other states and outside the United States. The Connecticut Green Industry (i.e., nurse ry, greenhouse, floriculture, sod, Christmas trees) is the largest agricultural business in Connecticut. The industry estimates that environmental horticulture generates $1.022 billion gross income supporting AT LEAST 22,000 full and part-time jobs in Connecticut. In conjunction with regu latory activities, Department staff conducts a surveillance pr ogram in Connecticut for a variety of established pests and for exotic plant pests not yet established in the state, some of regulatory concern, that repres ent a threat to our green industry, forests, and urban ornamental trees and shrubs. Surveillance for pl ant pests is performed in partnership with the United States Department of Agri culture (USDA) through the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) program a nd the U.S. Forest Service. Examples are Ramorum blight (aka Sudden Oak Death), a fungus-like pathogen th at can affect many plants, but that can be particularly devast ating to oaks and two beetles, the Asian longhorned beetle and Emerald ash borer that represent a thre at to our maples (and other trees) and ashes, respectively. In addition, we participated in a regional Forest Pest Survey and Outreach Program supported by th e USDA. For plant diseases of regulatory concern, we work closely with the Plan t Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. We also conduct forest health surveys and a statewide aerial survey for gypsy moth de foliation and a gypsy moth egg mass survey. The results of our plant and forest su rveys for 2009 may be found later in the Department's research activities along with summaries of our re gulatory activities. The staff of the Department of Entomology also takes the lead in providing extensive outreach activities for the Experiment Stati on by providing informati on to both children and adults about the Experiment Station's re search at public events, health fairs, and agricultural fairs, such as the Eastern Stat es Exposition (Big E) in Springfield, MA, Celebrating Agriculture in Woodstock, CT, th e Garden Expo in Fairfield, CT, the Yale Peabody Museum's Biodiversity Day, and th e Connecticut Flower and Garden Show. 116 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Honey bees, butterflies, wood-bor ing beetles and/or ticks con tinue to be popular exhibits at these events. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Insect Inquiry Office: Dr. Gale Ridge and Rose Hiskes, with the assistance in 2010 of Katherine Dugas and Katelyn King, answered questions from the public. The insect inquiry office in its present form has provided services for over 40 years. Insect identification services date back to the earlie st days of the institution starting with the first Annual Report of the C onnecticut Agricultura l Experiment Station published in 1877. The station announced that was offering to \"identify useful or injurious insect.....and to give useful information on th e various subjects of Agricultural Science for the use and advantage of the citizens of Connecticut\". The insect inquiry office is located on the top floor of the Jenkins Laboratory and receives thousands of visitors each year. Most of the inquiries were from visito rs (59% of total) to the office followed by telephone calls (28%), e-mail (7%), and mail (6%). The office served private citizens, pest control operators, the real estate industr y, nurseries, land care bus inesses, arborists, health departments, other medical prof essionals, housing authorities, museums, municipalities, libraries, state government, and the news media. Between July 31, 2009 and June 30, 2010 the insect inquiry offi ce handled at least 7,590 inquiries. These inquiries were quite diverse in subject with 856 categorie s of inquiry including insects, arachnids, animals, and diseases, as well as use of pesticides, insect damage, general entomology, and horticultural issues. Of these, 1,927 (25%) were related to people and medical issues, 496 were undetermined/general inquiries (7%), 4,719 (62%) were na tural resources, and 448 (6%) were food related. Human bed bug inquiries are high with 934 (12%) of the identifications performed by the office vs. 501 inquiries the previous year . In order of numbers, the second highest query was the western conifer seed bug, followed by carpenter ants, hemlock woolly adelgid, Indian meal moth, multi-colored lady beetle, springtails, carpenter bees, cicada killer wasps, euonymus scale, elongate hemlock scale, and delusory parasitosis. Termite activity was low with only 60 inquiries. The office identified several exotic insects. They were Stomatium species (Cerambycidae) imported in a bookcase from India, the spiraling whitefly imported on Hawaiian orchids, and the Ligurian/Mint leafhopper found on rosemary imported from California. Number of inquiries from 2004/05 to 2009/10, which have increased in recent years.

The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 117 The insect inquiry office encourages the education and training of students in science and entomology. Numerous student group s visit the office during the year. In the winter of 2010, Misha Holland from the New Haven School system was mentored by Dr. Ridge and Naomi Rogal, a junior in Beth Chana Academy High School in Orange, CT spent the summer of 2010 vol unteering in the office. Tick Testing: Ticks, primarily the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis , number of specimens submitted for iden tification. Ticks are processed in the Tick Testing Laboratory at th e Experiment Station by Elizabeth Alves and Bonnie Hamid . A total of 4,031 ticks feeding on humans were submitted for identification in 2009, of which 3,669 were the blacklegged tick or \"deer\" tick, Ixodes scapularis . Beginning in 2006, the policy was changed to only test engorged ticks. Therefore, of the ticks received in 2009, 1,768 (48.2%) were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causal organism for Lyme disease, and 666 (38 %) were found to carry this organism. Sponsored Meetings and Conferences: International Day of Climate Action (October 24, 2009). Dr. Kimberly Stoner led a coalition of organizations to organize two events highlighting the importance of the getting the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere below 350 parts per million to prevent global climate change. One ev ent, on the New Haven Green, drew 300 people to listen to speakers from CT NOFA, Conn ecticut Fund for the Environment, and the New Haven/Leon Sister City Proj ect and resulted in an aeri al photo of people spelling out \"3-5-0\" on the Green. The other event, at the Friends Meetinghouse in New Haven, drew 50 people to listen to speakers from the New Haven Transition Initiative on the subjects of climate change, peak oil, and developing resilience in the local co mmunity to deal with these crises. Community Farming Conference, 4 th annual (October 31, 2009). Dr. Kimberly Stoner organized, along with Bill Duesing of CT NOF A, the farming conference with 40 people attending at Jones Auditorium in Ne w Haven. The keynote speaker was Brooke Redmond, the Executive Director of the Farm-B ased Education Association, on the topic, \"Turnips, Teachers, Top Hat, and Toddlers: Something for Everyone on a Working Farm.\" Other speakers include d Priya Morganstern of the Pro Bono Partnership speaking on \"Legal Issues for Community Farms,\" Ki p Kolesinskas, State Soil Scientist for Connecticut and Rhode Island for the Natura l Resources Conservation Service, on \"How Community Farming Groups Can Assess their Soils,\" and Brianne Casadei of Terra Firma Farm on \"Business Planning for Community Farms.\" Dr. Stoner also spoke as part of a panel on issues in starting up community farms. Bird and Butterfly Garden: The Bird and Butterfly Garden is a partnership of the Federated Garden Club of Connecticut, the Sp ring Glen Garden Club of Hamden, and the Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment Station. Many maintenance and improvements to the garden are done by farm manager Richard Cecarelli and his staff and members of the Spring Glen Garden Club. The garden is open to the public Monday-Friday 8:30am- 4:00pm, it is closed on the weekends and st ate holidays. The garden creates several favorable habitats for our nati ve birds, butterflies, and pol linating insects and helps us determine which plants may work best in Southern Connecticut gardens. Plants are 118 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 labeled for easy identification. The Bird & Bu tterfly Garden at Lockwood Farm is listed in the 'Nature Conservancy Open Days Directory fo r New England'. Jeffrey Fengler observed 12 different butterflies species, 2 species of moth, 18 species of birds, 2 species of dragonflies, 1 wasp, and 1 Green Frog around the garden on Plant Science Day August 5, 2009.

Butterflies Birds Dragonflies Cabbage White Bluejay 12-spotted Sulphur Mourning Dove Eastern Tiger Swallowtail Barn Swallow Pearl Crescent Northern Flicker Common Sootywing Red-tailed Broad-winged Skipper Skipper Starling Mockingbir Bluejay Song Mourning Dove ACTIVITIES Natural Products for Tick Control: Dr. Kirby Stafford and postdoctoral scientist Dr. Anuja Bharadwaj began studies on evaluation of natural products for tick control with a grant from the Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention in 2008 and experiments continued through 2010 with the assistance of Heidi Stuber and summer workers Lindsley Colligan , Katherine Dugas , and Lauren Edwards . Nootkatone, a component of the essential oil from th e heartwood of Alaska yellow cedar, is also available as a synthetic and an extract from grapefruit. In order to improve the efficacy of nootkatone in the field, Dr. Robert Behle at the USDA-Agri cultural Research Service laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, a collaborator in the curre nt project, developed three extended duration formulations of nootkatone. Based on the results of efficacy testing against Ixodes scapularis nymphs before and after exposure to UV light, the Lignin Encapsulated 21% Nootkatone was selected for testing in the field in 2009. The field trial with was conducted at 3 home sites in Cannan and Co rnwall on 17 June 2009 at the rate of 1.4 g nootkatone/m2. The nootkatone provided 100% control throughout the whole sampling period from 20 June until 17August 2009. Filter pa per disks caged in chicken wire mesh placed at the treatment sites were picked up periodically for the nootkatone residual The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 119 analysis done in cooperation with the Department of Analytical Chemistry to see how long the compound lasted in the environment. Residual analysis showed that 95% or more of the nootkatone was gone within 7 days in 2008. Unfortunately, a similar pattern of loss was observed with the new formulation in 2009 following application possibly due to the extensive heavy rains with severe loss of nootkatone within days. Only 2% of the nootkatone was found left on the filter papers and 98% was lost by 2 days post application possibly due in part because the filter papers had deteriorated due to heavy rains. However, nootkatone ( 1.5 ug/g leaf litter) was detectable in the leaf litter 70 days post a pplication. While heavy rains resulted in surface loss of nootkatone, the rain appeared to ha ve moved some of the lignin-bound nootkatone into the tick habitat, resulting in extended control. Formulation and persistence issues need to be addressed to improve efficacy. A garlic-based product (Mosquito Barrier, Ga rlic Research Labs Inc., Glendale, CA) was also tested in 2009 in plots at 8 home sites in Salisbury, Canaan and Cornwall for suppression of I. scapularis . In a small trial in the laboratory, 70% repellency was observed against I. scapularis adults with the same product. Garlic appeared to suppress tick activity for 2-3 weeks. The suppression wa s 100% initially, decr easing to 60% and 42% by 13 and 27 days after application, resp ectively. The percent co ntrol remained at least 38% even after 55 days. The product la bel suggests reapplica tion every two weeks. Field trial for repellency of carvacrol, a nother compound present in the Alaska yellow cedar essential oil , against I. scapularis nymphs were repeated in July 2009. Two concentrations of carvacrol, 2 and 5% (v/v) in acetone were tested at 5 residential sites. Flannel tick drags were treated with carvacr ol solutions and the control drags were treated with acetone only. Ticks were samp led by dragging the treated and untreated (control) drags over the vegetation in the ma rked plots. The carvacrol showed some repellency against I. scapularis . There were 20 and 80% fewer ticks on the drags with 2 and 5% carvacrol, respectively. Some natural products/compounds and DEET (N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide) were evaluated for repellent activity against I. scapularis nymphs in the laboratory. Different concentrations of eucalyptus oil, mustard oil, allyl isothiocyanate, garlic oil, turmeric and carvacrol were tested using a modified in vitro vertical tick repellency bioassay. In brief, test compound was pipetted onto a cotton-tipped applicator and mounted to the bottom center of a 1-dram friction cap vial in non- toxic modeling clay. Th e treated area above a line is considered as the repellent zone. Singl e ticks are introduced at set intervals after treatment. A screening cloth was placed over the vial to prevent the tick from escaping; a Dr. Anuja Bharadwaj and Heidi Stuber monitor the application of the lignin-formulated nootkatone (Photo by Dr. Kirby Stafford). 120 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 human hand is placed over the vial for s timuli. If a tick crossed above the line and remained in the repellent zone for > 5s, the tick was deemed nonrepelled by the test compound. Carvacrol was found to be highly repellent against nymphs followed by mustard+turmeric combination, mosquito barrier, garlic oil, turmeric, allyl isothiocyanate and mustard oil. Temprid (cyfluthrin + imidacloprid) was evaluated for its efficacy against I. scapularis adults and nymphs. The pyrethroid, deltamethrin, was also tested for comparison with temprid. Two concentrations of temprid, 2.11 and 4.22 ml/litre and one concentration (6.15 ml/litre) of deltamethrin were evalua ted, which resulted in an application rate for temprid of 31.1 mg/m 2 (low) and 62.3 mg/m2 (high), and a rate of application of 12.5 mg/m2 for deltamethrin. Both temprid and deltamethrin were highly toxic (100% mortality) to both I. scapularis nymphs and adults. Temprid produced rapid knockdown of ticks with 100% morbidity within 24 hours with no recovery. A field trial with lignin encapsulated 21% nootkatone (same as above), maillard encapsulated 25% nootkatone, and garlic product (Mosquito Barrier) was conducted at 5, 4 and 3 home sites in Salisbury, Canaan, and Cornwall on 9 and 11 June 2010. The garlic product was also tested at 6 re sidential sites in Westport-We ston, CT. Initial tick samples after treatment in June 2010 found 80% control with the lignin-nootkatone, 50% control with the maillard-nootkatone formulation, and 70% reduction in tick activity with the garlic product. Chemical residual analysis and tick sampling are under study and all the data will be compiled at the end of tick season. Impact : Nootkatone and the garlic -based product were effective for control of nymphal I. scapularis , the vector of the causal agents for Lyme disease, human anaplasmosis and human babesiosis. Natural produc ts could provide an alternat ive to synthetic pesticides and an additional tool in an integrat ed tick management program to control I. scapularis . Work needs to continue to develop or improve the new extended-duration formulations of nootkatone. Ticks and Tick Associated Diseases : Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli , Dr. Scott C. Williams , and Dr. Erol Fikrig (Yal e University) assisted by Tia M. Blevins investigated the prevalence of antibodies to Borrelia antibodies both pathogens, the causative ag ents for Lyme diseas e anaplasmosis, during different seasons thr oughout the 11-year study. Of the 224 sera tested, 141 (63%) contained antibodies to B. burgdorferi , whereas 124 (55%) were positive to A. phagocytophilum . Reactivity to highly specific recombinant antigens (V1sE of B. burgdorferi and protein 44 of A. phagocytophilum provided strong confirmatory results of past or current inf ections. November and December is a suitable period to obtain blood samples from deer to conduct serosurveillan ce for both bacteria. Impact : Researchers in the midwestern United States are relying on analysis of deer sera to determine if B. burgdorferi and A. phagochytophilum are present in specified communities. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 121 Pesticides in Pollen and Nectar of Treated Squash: There is great concern across the U.S. and around the world about mortality of honey bees and the more general decline of many other species of pollinators. Pesticide exposure is one of many factors that may play a role in honey bee and pollinator decline. Systemic insecticides in the group called neonicotinoids have been a particular focus of concern for beekeepers in Connecticut and around the world. While there have been studies of pesticide residues in the pollen and nectar of crop plants treated as seeds, there are no studies in the literature of pest icide residues in pollen and nectar of crop plants treated by application of the insecticide to the seed furrow or by application of the insecticide through a drip irrigation system. In 2009, Dr. Kimberly Stoner, worked with farm manager Rich Cecarelli to set up an experiment where the systemic neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were applied at labeled rates to summer squash in two different ways: by spraying the seed hole just before planting the seed, and through application by drip irrigation. With the assistance of Tracy Zarrillo and Morgan Lowry, samples of male and female flower parts, pollen and nectar were collected from the squash, and analyzed by Dr. Brian Eitzer of the Department of Analytical Chemistry, using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to quantify the pesticide residues. The systemic neonicotinoid insecticides were found in nectar and in pollen of the squash treated with each of the different methods in levels that have been shown to have effects on the behavior of honey bees and that could also make them more susceptible to some pathogens, according to recent research. Effects on other important pollinators of squash, such as bumble bees and squash bees, are unknown. Insect pollination is absolutely essential to the production of squash, pumpkins and other cucurbit vegetables, so any effects on pollinators would be important to farmers as well as beekeepers. This experiment is being repeated in 2010. Impact: The role of chronic low-level exposure to pesticides is not well documented. This study will provide critical data on transport of severa l neonicotinoid insecticides applied at label rates in orde r to evaluate the exposure a nd role of pesticides on our pollinators.

The pollen was then analyzed for pesticide residues. 122 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Improved Use of Lindgren Funnels : Dr. Maier, assisted by Ellen Bulger, Morgan Lowry, Kaitlyn O'Donnell, and Tracy Zarrillo , continued to investigate how modifications to baited Lindgren funnels, trap s that imitate the form and sometimes the odor of a tree trunk, can improve the detecti on of beetles, wasps, and their natural enemies associated with wood. During 2009, th ey conducted field experiments to learn how the trap catch in conifer stands at P achaug State Forest, Vo luntown, varied among Lindgren traps supplied with different killi ng agents in their co llection cup or with different lids on their top. In a springtime experiment, the number of captured beetles of several species or families differed significantly among traps with different killing agents (vapona, soapy water, propylene glycol, and 70% ethyl alcoho l). The mean catch of checkered beetles, predators of bark and other beetles, was si gnificantly higher in traps with 70% ethyl alcohol than in those with othe r killing agents. The total ca tch of the ribbed pine borer (Rhagium inquisitor ), a common longhorned be etle, was significantly higher in traps with ethyl alcohol than in those with vapona or propylene glycol, whereas the mean catch of another longhorned beetle ( Asemum striatum ) associated with pine was statistically similar among treatments. Presumably, the addition of alcohol to collection cups can increase the attractiveness of traps to all checkered (Cle ridae) and certain longhorned beetles (Cerambycidae). The pattern in catch of a bark beetle (Dendroctonus valens ) was particularly notable because in funnels with alcohol the number was one third or less than it was in those with other killing agents. This experiment is being repeated to determine if an increased concentration of alcohol re pels certain species of bark beetles. A late-season experiment with the four different killing agents revealed no differences among treatments. The number of targeted insects (checkered beetles, longhorned beetles, and wood-wasps) capture d in traps was extremely low in 2009. Predatory checkered beetles, in particular, ap parently were not highl y attracted to traps baited with the odor of host trees in late su mmer or autumn, the time when these beetles normally seek suitable shelter for the winter. In experiments conducted in the spring and in the summer, the lid size (diameter of 30, 45, or 60 cm) of Lindgren traps with the sa me killing agent had minimal effect on the mean catch of targeted insects. Although nu merical variation in cat ch was evident, no statistically significant differences in th e number of captured checkered beetles, longhorned beetles, or wood-wasps occurred. Based on these findings from a pine forest, increasing lid size to reduce the amount of debr is and water that enters traps would not negatively impact the catch of targeted insects. Longhorned Beetles of Connecticut: Over the last few ye ars, Dr. Maier and his assistants have captured longhorned beetles in traps and reared them from wood to determine their distribution, host range, a nd period of adult activity. They have determined that about 220 species of longhor ned beetles could potentially infest woody and herbaceous plants in Connecticut, but onl y a small portion of the total have become pests. By using data from field studies and museum collections, they have found 192 species (87% of the potential total) in the state. To date, they have reared 75 species from dead wood collected in New England, a nd exam ined the period of adult activity of over 100 species. They are generating a database, which now has over 7,200 entries, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 123 including biological data derived from their studies. The information stored in this database should be useful for developing ma nagement plans for borers that are or may become pests. Impact: The information from these surveys and the longhorned beetle database will document native and exotic invasive insects a nd wood-borers in Connect icut and assist in developing management plans for the wood-borers that are pests. Surveys for Invasive Leaf Beetles : In 2009-2010, Dr. Maier and his assistants continued their survey to determine the distribution and th e hosts of the lily leaf beetle (Lilioceris lilii ) and the viburnum leaf in Connecticut. These destructive non-native beetles feed upon native and cultivated host plants in both their larval and adult stages. The lily leaf beetle is a major pest of cultivated Asiatic lilies throughout Connecticut. In 2010, this dest ructive beetle caused considerable damage to two native lilies, the Canada lily (Lilium canadense ) and the Turk's-cap lily ( L. superbum ). These wild lilies may be threatened with extinction w ithin the state if met hods to cope with the Asiatic beetle are not developed. Dr. Maier discovered that the European viburnum leaf beetle had damaged wild plants of two viburnum species in seven of ei ght counties in the state. Previously, the beetle was known only from nursery plants in three locations. Its widespread occurrence within the state now poses a seri ous threat not only to suscepti ble wild plants, but also to landscape and nursery plants. At several shad ed sites in northwest ern Connecticut, larvae of the viburnum leaf beetle completely defoliated Unscheduled Emergences of the periodical cicada (Magicicada septendecim ) reliably emerge in central Connecticut forests every 17 years. Mass emergences in the Northeast have been recorded since the 1600's; the next emergence in Connecticut will occur in 2013. In the past, very few individuals were out of developmental synchrony with the main population. In 2009, Dr. Maier discovered that in many forests in Connecticut and in the Hudson Valley of New York, small groups of adults emerged four years early. This odd ity also is apparently becoming increasingly common in other parts of the range of the 17-year periodical ci cada. In 2009, the accelerated emergences occurred principally at sites where human disturbance had altered the landscape to increase solar exposure and presumably soil temperature. Small Japanese Cedar Beetle: Dr. Claire Rutledge continued investigation of C. rufipenne's chemical ecology in coll aboration with Dr. Lawrence Hanks of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and Dr. Jocelyn Millar of the University of California, Riverside and their students. Callidiellum rufipenne is native to eastern Asia and was discovered in live arborvitae in Connecticut in 1998 by Dr. Gale Ridge, Carol Lemmon and Dr. Chris Maier. The borer has since establ ished in the southern half of Connecticut. C. rufipenne is found on plants in the family C upressaceae. Males recognize females by m eans of a contact pheromone in the female's epicuticle. We have identified the contact pheromone as the branched, saturated hydrocarbon 5,17 - dimethylnonacosane and completed synthesis of the compound, and th ese results have been published in the Journal Environmental Entomology. Continued i nvestigation into the ecological role of 124 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 the long-distance male-produced volatil e pheromone was also conducted. It was determined that both males and females res ponded to the pheromone in the field, but at low numbers. Agrilus species - The genus Agrilus (Coleoptera: Buprestid ae) contains several species of economic importance, both nativ e and invasive. Dr. Rutledge is pursuing several lines of research with three memb ers of this genus. The Bronze Birch Borer (BBB), Agrilus anxious Glory, a native insect, requires st ressed, living tr ees to develop, and thus frequently attack birches in lands cape and nursery settings. The beetles cause considerable aesthetic and financial da mage to homeowners and nurserymen in Connecticut. The Two-lined Chestnut Borer (TLCB) A. bilineatus (Weber) is a pest of oaks and can outbreak when oak trees are st ressed by other problems such as drought, winter moth or gypsy moth. The Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), A. planipennis Fairmaire, an invasive pest, is a native of Asia that was discovered in Detroit MI in 2002 and has spread widely. While not yet in Connecticut, research is crucial to preparing for its expected arrival. In collaboration with Dr. Melody Keena USDA FS, Dr. Rutledge is pursuing a multi- pronged approach to studying the reproducti ve behavior of BBB, EAB and TLCB which encompasses mating behavior, mate choice, the kinetics of sperm transfer and storage, and the impact of mating frequency on fecundity . The results of this research are being used to improve laboratory rearing of EA B, as well as to understand the population dynamics of the species and how it compares to the native Agrilus . Cerceris fumipennis : Finally, Cerceris fumipennis (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae ) are solitary hunting wasp uses adult buprestid beetles to provision her nest for her larvae. The wasps nest in colonies of 1 - 500 holes and prefer hard-packed sandy soil. When colonies are located it is easy to monitor the wasps returning to their holes and identify the beetles that they are carrying. In areas that are infested by EAB, the wasps will bring EAB adults to the nests. Thus the wasp provides a highly efficient, effective and free 'bio-surveillance' system. We have located many colonies of the wasp in Connecticut. The first study was jointly funded by USDA FS and APHIS/ PPQ and is in conjunction with researchers at SUNY ESF in Syracuse, Dr. Melissa Fierke, Maine Forest Service, Ms. Colleen Teerling, and Ag Canada Mr. Philip Careless. The objective is to determine the number of degree days (a measure of accumulated Top, Mioara Scott working at a Cerceris colony; Bottom, a beetle caught in a collar put over a C. fumipennis hole. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 125 heat) the wasp requires to emerge as an a dult. This knowledge can be used to predict when wasps emerge in natural colonies, and to facilitate rearing of the wasps in the laboratory. Captive wasp colonies can be used to provide 'surveillanc e services' in areas where invasive buprestids are suspected in much the same way that honey bee colonies are used to provide pollinati on services in agriculture. The second project, in which Connecticut was part of a multi-state consortium funded by USDA FS, was the ongoing bio-surveillance of known naturally-occu rring colonies in Connecticut for the presence of emerald ash borer and other potent ial invasive buprestid beetles. This year we began the 'Wasp Wa tchers' program in Connecticut. Volunteers were recruited at professional meetings of arborist, nursery growers, master gardener classes, and other outreach events. Each volunteer was then assi gned a colony close to their home. Watchers received the equipmen t and training to mon itor their colony and collected beetles that will be sent to us at the end of the season. Twenty-three volunteers completed training. This program allowed us to monitor a large number of colonies with only 2 full-time staff. We now have a netw ork of concerned citizen s-scientists who can help to raise awareness of invasive species. The final project with Cerceris fumipennis was begun summer 2009, and continued in summer 2010 in conjunction with Dr. Peter Silk of Agriculture Canada. We are investigating which chemical components comm on to the epicutical of all Buprestidae that are attractive to C. fumipennis females. Wasps will grasp, sting and bring into their nests paralyzed or freshly dead buprestid beet les, but not beetles in other families. The attractive components can be removed by wash ing with solvents, and then restored by applying the extract. One potenti al application of this finding is to enable captive wasp colonies to be provisioned with beetles other than buprestids, which are difficult and expensive to rear. Impact: Some native and exotic wood-boring beetles can pose a significant threat to nursery, landscape, and forest trees. Pest detection and knowledge of the biology and possible natural enemies of these beetles is important to successful eradication of imported pests or development of management plans for established wood-borers that are pests. NURSERY AND PLANT INSPECTION ACTIVITIES Plant inspection and regulato ry services are coordina ted and conducted by State Entomologist Dr. Kirby Stafford , Deputy State Entomologist Dr. Peter Trenchard , Stephen Sandrey, Jeffrey Fengler, Tia Blevins, and Apiary Inspector Ira Kettle. The Survey and Inspection Team at th e Eastern Plant Board Meeting (April 6-9, 2009, Portland, ME). The 84 th Annual Meeting of the Eastern Plant Board was held in conjunction with the 35th Annual Meeting of the Horticu ltural Inspection Society (HIS) and the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS). During the EPB Meeting, Dr. Victoria Smith presented annual reports on behalf of the National CAPS Committee and the National Plant Board P. ramorum Working Group, and was elec ted Vice President of the Eastern Plant Board. For the HIS meeting, Peter Trenchard presented two talks titled \"CWR Strikes Again\" and \"Trace-back Troubles: another P. ramorum Saga.\" Peter 126 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 was also elected Newsletter Editor for HIS, Steve Sandrey was elected Archivist, and Tia Blevins was elected Treasurer. Rose Hiskes attended the CAPS m eeting as the State Survey Coordinator for Connecticut, and participated in discussions on data management, GIS mapping, surveys, and taxonomy. The Survey and Inspection Team participated in a Snail Blitz (27 May 2010), coordinated by the Wallingford office of USDA-AP HIS-PPQ. Trained detector dogs and their handlers, from the Detector Dog Training Center in Newnan, GA, searched for invasive snails and slugs in areas surrounding ports and rail freight yards. Snails and slugs were found and collected, and retained for later identification. Pictured are Tia Blevins, Jeff Fengler and Steve Sandrey setting up a sample site. Nursery Inspection and Certification : Three-hundred and two nurseries were certified to conduct intra- and interstate business. There were 674 nursery inspections during the growing season. Four-thousand, one-h undred and forty acres of nursery stock were examined as well as plants growing under 26,286,945-sq. ft. of greenhouse space. The majority of plants were grown in hoop houses (21,463,004 sq. ft.), followed by plastic greenhouses (3,080,651 sq. ft.) and glass greenhouses (1,743,290 sq. ft.). Nursery Insects: The most abundant pests found in nurseries were aphids on various trees and shrubs, mites on various tr ees and shrubs, black vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus ) on Taxus, Arborvitae Tsuga, and lacebug on Pieris, Rhododendron and Azalea . Japanese Beetle Certification : We observed treatments of 79,904 plants at one nursery and issued phytosanitary certificates to comply with st ates that quarantine nursery stock from Connecticut be cause of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica . One nursery, which met the containerized nursery stock accreditation program requirements of the United States Japane se Beetle Harmonization Plan, shipped 5,000 plants to other states in 2009. Four nurseries met other requirements of the United States Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan and shipped 2,890 plants to states that quara ntine plants from Connecticut. Japanese Beetle Certification to Canada : Thirteen Connecticut nurseries, which met the inspection requirements of the US/Canada Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan, shipped 53,220 plants to Canada in 2009. Nursery Dealer Permits : Nursery dealer permits were issued to 188 firms. One- hundred seventy of these companies operate individual outlets. The remaining businesses have more than one outlet each. In total, there were 577 outlets. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 127 Phytosanitary Certificates : Three-hundred and fifty-f our phytosanitary inspection certificates were issued covering the shipme nt of the following plant materials to destinations outside the United States: Plants Number Apples (Cartons) 11,000 Bulbs & Tubers (Dahlia & Gladiolas)(Bags) 616 0 American Chestnut (unrooted cuttings) 80Chinese tree peonies (plants) 54Greenhouse plants 25,560Nursery stock (containers - B & B) 22,553Orchids (plants) 5,465Perennials (bare root plants) 5,054 (plants) (unrooted cuttings) 1,175 300 Seeds (cartons & bags) 291Tobacco (bales, boxes, bundles & cartons) 116,072 Tobacco (pounds) Cotton seed meal (bags) 4,6861,600 Special Inspections : Ten inspections were made fo r 160 individual plants and bulbs to assist homeowners moving out of state. One-hundred forty seven inspections were made to assist nurseries moving the following plants interstate: Plants Number Perennials (plants) 79,904 Nursery stock (containers) 5,000 (bare root plants) 1,504 (B & B) 2,666 Corn seed (pounds) 2 Geraniums 1,240 Greenhouse plants 286 Orchids 56Seed (Bags) 132 One tobacco grower had 110.5 acres inspected fo r the aerial application of pesticides. There was no Post-Entry Quar antine activity in CT in 2009. Biotechnology Regulatory Se rvices Inspection Activity : In cooperation with officers from the Wallingford USDA-APHI S-PPQ office, six inspections were conducted in 2009 at facilities or laboratorie s working with recombinant or regulated organisms. Permits to Move Live Plants, Noxious Weeds, and Soil : In 2009, there were sixty four PPQ 526 Permits (Permit to move live plant pests, noxious weeds, and soil) approved in CT. There were two PPQ 330 Permits (per mit to move soil) approved in CT. 128 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 FOREST HEALTH SURVEY During the summer of 2009, we examined 51 permanent, one-acre forest plots that were established to monitor forest health in Connecticut. These plot s are located on state, Nature Conservancy, and municipal water company properties. We considered 25 pathogens for monitoring and determined which trees served as host plants. Within each plot, 20 to 30 trees were tagged for long-term studies. We evaluated signs of defoliation and disease, such as dead tree branches , limbs and crowns. Descriptions and determinations are designed to reflect increasi ng damage or tree decline. We measure the trees at Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) as an additional way to monitor their health. We will continue to use these plots to mon itor the forests over several years to assess whether our state forests remain healthy or ar e declining. In general, our forests remain healthy. Tornado Damage : The National Weather Service c onfirmed that an F1 tornado touched down June 26 in Wethersfield CT . Members of the National Weather Service surveyed damage in Wethersfield and Farmington; damage in towns surrounding Hartford was caused by straight-line winds , but a narrow tornado had formed in Wethersfield. The NWS said winds in th e town reached speeds between 85 and 100 MPH. Unfortunately damage was most severe in the historic town center, and many 200- year-old trees were destroyed, along with several historic hom es and buildings. In total, 246.4 acres were affected by this tornado. Ice Damage: Several locations in Litchfield County were severely affected by ice storms in the winter of 2008-2009. All species of trees were affect ed, with breakage of major branches and trunks occurring. Damage was primarily at higher elevations, such as hilltops and ridges. In total, 1,711.0 acres were affected by ice. INSECT AND DISEASE SURVEYS Gypsy Moth : Our annual aerial survey for gypsy moth defoliation was conducted in July- August 2009 and covered 1.8 million acres of urban/suburban forest in all eight Connecticut counties. Gypsy moth defolia tion of 6,709.0 acres was found in following counties: COUNTY TOTAL ACRES Hartford 1,665.6 New London 1,493.6 Tolland 3,549.8 TOTAL 6,709.0 In November and December, a gypsy moth egg mass survey was conducted in 80- 95% favorable host sites on a 7 -mile grid ( 102 sites) throughout C onnecticut. No egg masses were found. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 129 DEFOLIATION IN CONNECTICUT - 2009 Orange-Striped Oakworm : The Orange-striped oakworm, Anisota senatoria, is a native moth that ranges from eastern Canada s outhward to Georgia. It is a common pest of oak species in Connecticut. Occasionally, local infestations occur when oaks have been stressed by other factors such as drought or gypsy moths. Serious defoliation can occur when this happens. The moths lay up to 500 eggs on the undersides of an oak leaves in early summer and ar e attracted to artificial light . The caterpillars feed on the foliage, and then they burrow into the soil and build an ea rthen cell, where it pupates and passes the winter. On October 2, 3, &10, 2007, a statewide aerial survey was conducted for orange-striped oak worm defoliati on. Defoliation was found in Windham County (3,062.9 acres) and in New London County (2,152,5 acres). Total acres defoliated were 5,215.4. Forest Tent Caterpillar : The Forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria , is a native insect found throughout th e range of hardwood forests in North America. It is more abundantly distributed in eastern Nort h America, but is also common in western areas that have large stands of aspen. At times, this insect can be a damaging defoliator of trees. Trees that are defoliated often flush a new, smaller set of leaves in July. While the forest tent caterpillar does not typically cause mortality to host trees, mortality can occur when populations interact with other disturbances, such as drought or insect outbreaks. Forest tent caterpillar larvae use silk to form trails and to create pads on host trees where 130 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 they congregate and rest. During 2009, an outbreak of Forest tent caterpillar resulted in the defoliation of 1,900.4 acres in Windham County. Asian Longhorned Beetle : The Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis , first discovered to be attacki ng trees in August of 1996 in New York, has spread to within 25 miles of Greenwich in southwestern Connecticut. There is risk for beetle entry in ports because of the transportation of solid wood packing material on ships coming from areas of the world where this beetle is found. We, therefore, concentrated additional survey efforts in Connecticut in the areas of Bridgeport, Groton, New Haven and New London as well as their surrounding parks that contain a high percentage of maple, a favorite food source of the Asian longhorned beetle. In addition, the 2008 detection of ALB in Worces ter, MA, spurred increased interest and vigilance concerning the beet le. We conducted eighty inspections of 7,139 trees in all counties of CT for pres ence or signs of ALB infestation. We also participated in a United States Forest Service survey in Southwestern Connecticut. We examined 300 Asian longhorned beetle host species trees in 18 square miles in Greenwich and Stamford. All surv eys and identifications, thus far, were negative. We also inspected 1 tree for a homeowner in 2009. Septoria Leaf Spot of Maple : Rainy and cool weather th roughout Connecticut during spring and summer created conditi ons ideal for the fungus known as Septoria aceris , which causes septoria leaf spot. A septoria infection is characterized by small brown spots rimmed with yellow when the leaves are still green. As the spots grow and merge, they perforate the leaves, resulting in premature leaf dr op and defoliation. The long-term implications for the trees' health are minima l. Damage due to Septoria Leaf Spot of maple was considerable enough to warrant mapping during aerial survey. Data are included on the defoliation map and are summarized below by county. COUNTY TOTAL ACRES Fairfield 663.5 Hartford 665.4 Litchfield woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae , remains an important pest of hemlock in Connecticut, sp reading northward since its coastal detection in 1985 and infesting all 169 towns in the state. During 2009, we required all hemlock nursery stock that was being shipped out of Connecticut to be treated for Hemlock woolly adelgid. Two nurseries shipped hemlock trees out of state. Our inspectors observed treatmen ts and issued phytosanitary certificates to cover 940 plants in these shipments. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 131 Ramorum Leaf Blight : As part of the P. ramorum National Nursery Survey, we inspected 20 nurseries during 2009. During the survey, 148,379 plants were inspected and 275 samples were collected from symptomatic plants. All samples were cultured and tested by ELISA; DNA from ELISA-positive pl ants was sent to Beltsville for confirmation by polymerase chain reaction (P CR). One hundred and forty five samples were ELISA positive; none were PCR-positive. In conjunction with the US Forest Serv ice, one stream surrounding a production nursery involved in trace-back ac tivity was selected for baiting for P. ramorum . One set of baits was located upstream of the nurse ry, and the second was located downstream, near the irrigation intake for the nursery. The stream was baited with rhododendron leaves for 2-week deployments during April through September 2008, with a 6-week break during July and August, when water temperatures were too warm for Phytophthora species. Leaf baits were submitted for testing to labs at Mississippi State University and Cornell University. All baits were negative for P. ramorum . In June of 2009, we received orders for a trace back to be conducted at the CT nursery described above. P. ramorum -positive plants had been found at a garden center in North Carolina; this establishment also had received plant material from many other suppliers. Nineteen samples were taken of sy mptomatic foliage, and irrigation water in 3 ponds was baited with rhododendron leaves. Al l samples were cultured and tested by ELISA; DNA from ELISA-positive samples was sent to Beltsville for confirmation by PCR. Six foliar samples were ELISA-posit ive, and none were PCR-positive. The six aquatic samples were negative. Daylily Rust : Daylily rust, caused by, Puccinia hemerocallidis, was found on daylilies in a southeastern U.S. nursery for the first time in the summer of 2000, and in 2001 and 2002 on daylilies owned by private citize ns. It is now confirmed to occur in three counties. During 2009, we surveyed dayl ilies in nurseries and garden centers for signs of this rust. Eighty-n ine inspections were carried out on 76,899 plants. No signs of Puccinia hemerocallidis were found. Chrysanthemum White Rust : In 2009, we conducted twen ty one inspections for Chrysanthemum white rust (CWR), caused by the fungus Puccinia horiana. As part of trace back activity from a grocery store detection, 50,000 plants we re inspected at a grower on August 12-13; no symptomatic plan ts were found. A second grower reported CWR at his own location in mid-Septem ber; 20,000 plants were inspected and 8,500 were destroyed by burial on site. At a thir d location, 93 symptomatic plants were found and destroyed by disposal in the municipal waste stream. Apiary Certification: Six hundred and seventy eight beekeepers registered 4,209 colonies in 2009. Our bee inspector opened and inspected 707 colonies in areas known to have foulbrood disease. No clinical ca ses of American foulbrood were detected. Nosema ceranae was detected in New London C ounty. Chalkbrood was reported to be widespread. Varroa mite is gene rally distributed in beehives across the state. There were no positives for tracheal mites. 132 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 County Colonies Opened & Inspected Fairfield 17 Hartford 32 Litchfield 45Middlesex 37New Haven 106New London 310 Tolland 12Windham 148 TOTAL 707 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 133 DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES Mosquito Trapping and Testing Program Mosquito surveillance for West Nile (WN) virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is integral to the public heal th response to these mosquito-transmitted viruses in Connecticut. The objectives of the surveillanc e program are to provide : 1) early evidence of local virus activity; 2) information on the abundan ce, distribution, identity and infection rates of potential mos quito vectors and; 3) informati on that is used to assess the threat of WN virus and EEE to the public and guide the implementation of mosquito control measures. The CAES is responsib le for conducting all mosquito trapping and testing activities. The program is conducted by Dr. Theodore Andreadis and Dr. Philip Armstrong , assisted by John Shepard, Michael Thomas , and Shannon Finan . Mosquito trapping is conducted at 91 permanen t trapping stations th at are located in 72 municipalities throughout the state. In 2009, mosquito trapping was conducted from June 2 to October 16. Traps were set and attended by CAES staff every 10 days at each site on a regul ar rotation. Two trap types were used at all trapping stat ions - a CO2-baited CDC Light Tr ap, designed to trap host- seeking adult female mosquitoes (all species), and a Gravid Mosquito Trap, designed to trap previously blood-fed adult female mosquitoes (principally Culex and container breeding Ochlerotatus species). Mosquitoes were transported alive to the laboratory each morning where they were identified to species. Mosquitoes were grouped (pooled) according to species, collecting site, and date and frozen at -80oC. A maximum of 50 female mosquitoes were included in each pool. Aliquots of each mosquito pool were inoculated into Vero cell cultures for dete ction of WN and other mosquito-borne arboviruses of public health impor tance. Virus isolates from mosquito pools were tested for WN, EEE, Jamestown Canyon (JC), C ache Valley (CV), Trivittatus (TVT), Highlands J (HJ), and LaCrosse (LAC), and Po tosi (POTV) viruses. Isolated viruses were identified by Real Time (TaqMan) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or standard RT-PCR using virus-specific primers. All of the virus isolation work was conducted in a certified Bio-Safety Level 3 laboratory at the CAES. Weekly test results were reported to the CDC electronically via ArboNet and to the DPH for dissemination to other state agencies, local health departments, the media, and neighboring states. For the 2009 season, a total of 291,641 mosquitoes (16,894 pools) representing 35 species were trapped and tested. A total of 122 isolations of EEE virus were made from 13 mosquito species: Culiseta melanura = 83, 3, Ae. vexans = 2, An. quadrimaculatus = 2, An. walkeri = 2, Oc. trivittatus = Oc. triseriatus = 1, Psorophora ferox = 1, collected at 25 lo cations in 23 towns in 7 counties: Fairfield (Darien, Greeenwich, M onroe, Newtown, Shelton), Hartford (South Windsor), Middlesex (Chester, Killingwor th), New Haven (Guilford, Madison, North 134 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Branford), New London (Ledyard, Lyme, North Stonington, Ol d (Hebron, Tolland, Willington), and Windham(Hampton, Plainfield). The first positive mosquitoes were collected on August 17, and the last on October 27. The majority of EEE isolations were from southern regions of Middlesex, New Haven and New London Counties. There was one EEE horse case in Windham County( Sterling) and two EEE positive pheasant flocks in New London (Norwich) and Tolland (Ellington) Counties. There were no human cases of EEE reported. A total of 35 isolations of WN virus were made from 4 mosquito species: pipiens = 25, Cx. salinarius = 1, Ochlerotatus stimulans = 1, collected at 19 sites in 16 towns in 5 counties: Fairfiel d, (Darien, Greenwich, Monroe, New Canaan, Shelton, Stratford), Hartford (Farmington), Middlesex (Killingworth), New Haven (Cheshire, East Haven, Madison, Milford, North Branford, West Haven), and New London, (Old Lyme) (Figure 1). The first positive mosquitoes were collected on July 11, and the last on October 20. This represents the latest historical isolation of WNV in the state. As in prior years, the majority of WN virus activity was detected in densely populated urban and suburban regions in southwestern (Fairfield and New Haven Counties) Connecticut. No human or horse cases of WN were reported. Other mosquito-borne viruses isolated includ ed: Highlands J (HJ) = 61 isolates from 12 species (Aug. 8-Oct. 20); Jamestown Canyon (J C) = 43 isolates from 11 species (Jun. 1- Aug. 3); Trivattatus (TVT) = 29 isolates from 4 species (Aug. 8-Sept. 1); Cache Valley (CV) = 1 isolate from 1 species (Aug. 11); Flanders (FL) = 1 isolate from 1 species (July 7).

Mosquitoes were collected at 91 trap sites, located in 72 municipalities, in Connecticut. Following identification, the insect s were processed for virus isolations and identified using molecular methods to analyze RNA. During 2009, 291,641 mosquitoes were tested for virus. There were 35 isola tions of WN virus and 122 isolations of EEE. There were no human cases in the state li nked to WN or EEE virus infection. News releases included information on how resident s could protect themselves from mosquito bites, such as the use of repellents. The in formation contained in the news releases had an immediate impact because many residents did take the suggested precautions. The long-term benefits include a healthy hu man population and a well-informed public concerning the potential risks of mosquito bites. Participation in the statewide surveillance program provided timely informa tion about levels of virus activity in the mosquito population which was used to assess risk of human infection, inform the public and health care providers of these risks, guide vector control efforts, and prevent disease outbreaks. Mosquito and Arbovirus Studies Dr. Philip Armstrong and Dr. Theodore Andreadis evaluated the role of different mosquito species to serve as vectors of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus in Connecticut. EEE virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving Culiseta melanura mosquitoes and avian hosts, whereas other mosquito species that feed opportunistically on mammals have been incriminated as bridge vectors to humans and horses. To evaluate the capacity of these mosquitoes to acquire, replicate, and potentially transmit EEE virus, the infection prevalence and virus titers were estimated fr om mosquitoes collected in Connecticut in 2009 by cell culture, plaque titration, and quantitative RT-PCR. EEE virus was isolated from 122 mosquito pools representing 14 diffe rent species and 7 genera, collected from August 17- October 27, 2009 in 25 of 91 trapping locations. Cs. melanura yielded the greatest number of EEE virus isolations (n=83) followed by Ochlerotatus canadensis (10) and Aedes cinereus (6). Relatively few ( 4) or no EEEV isolates were obtained from the remaining mosquito species collected. Cs. melanura contained significantly higher virus titers (mean=6.55 log 10 plaque forming units (PFU)/ mosquito pool) than all other mosquito species for which statistical comp arisons were possible (Mann Whitney U test, p<0.01). Ae. cinereus and Oc. canadensis exhibited the next highe virus titers of 2.92 and 2.82 log 10 PFU/mosquito pool and mean titers ranged from <0.8-1.69 log 10 PFU/mosquito pool in the remaining species. Cs. melanura was the only species that supported virus titers associated with EEE virus transmission, previously estimated The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 137 between 4-7 logs of virus in transmitting mosquitoes. This suggests that EEE virus is transmitted primarily by Cs. melanura and this species may serve as both enzootic and bridge vector in this region of the US, de spite repeated virus isolations from other mammalophilic mosquitoes during episodes of virus amplification. Impact. These investigations on the role of differe nt mosquito species to serve as vectors of viral pathogens can be used to target anti-vector interventions more effectively. A 3-yr study was undertaken by Dr. Theodore Andreadis and Dr. Philip Armstrong assisted by John Shepard and Michael Thomas in cooperation with the New York City Departments of Health & Mental Hygiene, to examine the parity status (i.e., whether or not a mosquito has layed eggs), survival and prevalence of West Nile (WN) vi rus in overwinteri ng populations of Culex pipiens pipiens collected from a hibernaculum located in a WN virus endemic region in New York City. Nearly 6,000 females were collected from December through April. Parity rates were highest among females collected in December and January, ranging from 12.3% to 21.9% depending on the year. In e ach year of the study, the proportion of parous females (i.e., those that deposited at least one batch of eggs ) declined significantly during the course of the winter with the percentage of parous females found in April ranging from 0.9% to 10%. Results provide unequivocal evidence that parous female Cx. p. pipiens from this region of the northeastern US enter hibernacula in the fall in comparatively high proportions not previously recognized for this species, and while these females experience significant mortality during the winter some survive to April to emerge in the spring. The absence of any detectible blood remnan ts in overwintering females reaffirm that blood feeding does not occur among diapausing females during the winter. The possibility that a portion of the diapausing population may be autogenous (production of eggs without a blood meal) as a result of hybridization with sympatric below-ground populations of Cx. p. pipiens \"form molestus\" is discussed. A single isolation of WN virus was obtained in Ve ro cell culture from a pool of 50 females collected on January 11, 2007 representing an infection prevalence of 0.07% in the overwintering population in 2007 (n = 1,370 mosqu itoes, 33 pools). No isolations of WN virus were made from mosquitoes collected in 2008 (n = 1,870 mosquitoes, 190 pools) or 2009 (n = 1,767 mosquitoes, 184 pools). Findin gs provide further evidence for local overwintering of WN virus in diapausing Cx. p. pipiens, albeit at very low rates, 138 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 consistent with the paucity of WN virus posi tive mosquitoes detected in June and early July despite the emergence of females from hibernacula in early May in this region. Southern California remain s an important focus of West Nile (WN) virus activity, with persistently elevated incidence after i nvasion by the virus in 2003 and subsequent amplification to epidemic levels in 2004. Ecoepidemiological studies of vectors-hosts-pathogen interactions are of paramount importance for better understanding of the transmission dynamics of WN virus and other emerging mosquito-borne arboviruses. Drs. Goudarz Molaei, Theodore Andreadis, Philip Armstrong in collaboration with scientists from several Mosqu ito and Vector Control District s in CA investigated vector- host interactions and blood-feeding behavior of 4 competent mosqu ito vectors by using a PCR method targeting mitochondrial DNA to identify vertebrate hosts of blood-fed mosquitoes. Diagnostic testing by cell cult ure, real-time RT-PCR, and immunoassays were additionally used to exam ine WN virus infection in bl ood-fed mosquitoes, mosquito pools, dead birds, and mammals. Analyses of engorged Culex quinquefasciatus revealed that this mosquito species acquired 88% of the blood meals from avian and 11.6% from mammalian hosts, including humans. Similarly, Cx. tarsalis fed 82% on birds and 18% on mammals. Culex erythrothorax fed opportunistically on both birds (59%) and mammals (41%). In contrast, Cx. stigmatosoma acquired all blood meals from avian hosts. House finches and a few other mostly passeriform birds served as the main hosts for the blood-seeking mosquitoes. Evidence of WN virus infection was detected in mosquito pools, wild birds, dead birds, and mammals, including humans with cases of fatalities during the study. Impact. These findings emphasize the important ro le of house finches and several other passeriform birds in the maintenance and amplification of WN virus in southern California, with Cx. quinquefasciatus acting as both the principal enzootic and bridge vector responsible for the spil lover of WN virus to humans . Other mosquito species, including Cx. tarsalis and Cx. stigmatosoma, are important but less widely distributed, and also contribute to spa tial and temporal transmission of WN virus in southern California. Invasive Aquatic Plant Program Statewide surveill ance and mapping of Connecticut lakes for aquatic vegetation. The goal of this project is to quantify the presence of invasive aquatic plants in Connecticut's lakes and ponds, determine their effects on native plant communities, establish baseline data to track their spread and provide information that is critical for developing control strategies. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 139 During the 2009 field season, Greg Bugbee assisted by Martha Balfour, mapped aquatic vegetation at 24 lakes and ponds. When added to the 138 water bodies previously surveyed, the total is now 162. In addition, Candlewood Lake, Connecticut's largest lake, was surveyed for the third consecutive year to determine the effects of alternate year deep and shallow winter drawdown on the i . Lake's Lillinonah and Zoar (other large lakes) were surveyed for the second time to track the long-term population dynamics of invasive and native species. Global positioning system (GPS) deri ved transects were established within each water body to quantitatively track changes in the abundance and dist ribution of aquatic plant species over time. Water samples were collected from all lakes and ponds and were analyzed for alkalinity, clarity, conductiv ity, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, pH, phosphorus and temperature. These data, along with watershed information, are being used to investigate the factors that influence the susceptibility of certain water bodies to certain invasive species. Dry specimens of all the pl ant species have been archived in the CAES herbaria for future reference. All informati on is incorporated into the Invasive Aquatic Plant Program website ( http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ). More than 60 percent of Connecticut lakes a nd ponds contain one or more invasive plant species. In some cases, as ma ny as four invasive species are present. The most common invasive plants are Eurasian watermilfoil, variable Fence Rock Pond in Guilford revealed Connecticut's first infestation of Brazilian waterweed (Egeria densa). Greg Bugbee is investigating the use of aerial images as a surveillance tool. In 2008, CAES and a consortium of other state agencies funded a flyover of Connecticut by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The high resolutionimagery, using red, green, blue and near infrared wavelengths, was supplied to stakeholders in 2009. We compared our 2008 field survey of Candlewood Lake to the 140 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 imagery and found reasonably good viewing of the Eurasian watermilfoil beds . Of the 456 acres found by CAES field reconnaiss ance, 351 acres could be detected by the aerial imagery. More sophisticated software is available for analyzing the imagery that could improve the results, and we will be investigating this in the future imagery. Control of Variable Wate r Milfoil in Bashan Lake, East Haddam, CT. Greg Bugbee and staff are in the eleventh year of research involving the use of spot applications of the herbicide 2, 4-D to control variable watermilfoil in Bashan Lake. Th ey have largely restored the lake to preinfestation conditions; however, regrowth requires yearly surveys and modest retreatments. For a fifth consecutive year, we have shown the effectiveness of late summer herbicide applications, thus limiting th e herbicide exposure of those who use the lake. They have integrated underwater video equipment with GPS and geographic information system (GIS) techno logy to precisely locate and tr eat the patches of variable watermilfoil. Control of curly leaf pondweed and Eurasi an Water milfoil with preturion diquat application in Crystal La ke, Middletown CT. Crystal Lake has extens ive growth of curly leaf pondweed and Eurasian watermilfoil. Chemical control efforts have been hampered due to the presence of the threatened plant species Potamogeton vaseyi. In 2007 , Greg Bugbee used limnobarriers to isolate the threatened plant and then used the aquatic herbicide diquat to remove the invasive plants . The treatment occurred in late April and after several weeks, the unwan ted vegetation was controlled. By late summer re-growth of curly leaf pondweed had begun but no Eurasian milfoil was observed. This trend continued in 2008 with re-growth of the curl y leaf pondweed to pretreatment levels but virtually no re-growth of the Eurasian watermilf oil. This near complete elimination of Eurasian watermilfoil by the April diquat treat ment may be a new tool for controlling this plant but further study is needed. In 2008, a survey Potamogeton vaseyi by CT DEP found that the plant was growi ng well; however, none was locat ed in 2009. Eight species of native plants were found the year after treat ment compared to only four the year prior to treatment. This suggests that the applica tion of diquat did not adversely affect plant communities and may have actually benefited native species. Longer-term control of the curly leaf pondweed probably requ ires reducing its bank of reproductive structures in the sediment called turions. Consecutive early s eason Diquat applications were made in 2009 and 2010 to test if this will occur. Again, limnobarriers were installed and populations of all plants were monitored. In 2010, in collaboration with the CAES Department of Analytical Chemistry, the movement and degradation of the diquat herbicide was monitored both inside and outsi de the limnobarriers and in the outflow stream. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 141 Biological control of Eurasian milfoil with the milfoil weevil. Greg Bugbee has continued research on the Eurasian watermilfoil and the milfoil weevil (Euhrychiopsis lecontei). that this insect has controlled Eurasian watermilfoil in other states and is native to most lakes with Eurasian watermilfoil in CT. Unfortunately, weevil populations in CT are rarely high enough to cause a significant reduction in milfoil. We are currently conduc ting two long-term investigations on augmenting milfoil weevil populations to determ ine if control of Eurasian watermilfoil will result. The first project is in Candlewood Lake. Although Candlewood Lake contains over 350 acres of Eurasian watermilf oil, our surveillance found the weevil to be nearly nonexistent. This offered an excel lent opportunity to determine if weevil augmentation can increase the long-te rm population. In early 2008, CAES in collaboration with Western Connecticut State University, The Candlewood Lake Authority and EnviroScience, Inc. introduced 10,000 weevils into thr ee carefully selected sites. In 2009, the weevil population in the sites changed little from pretreatment densities. In June 2010, an additional 5000 weevils were stocked into a previously augmented site and 11,000 weevils were stocked into a new site. We will continue to monitor both weevil and milfoil pop ulations in the stocked sites and an un-stocked site to determine if the weevils persist and begin to reach densities ca pable of controlling Eurasian watermilfoil. Our s econd milfoil weevil investigation site is located at Indian Lake, in Sharon, CT. The Indian Lake Associ ation initiated a weevil stocking program in 2008. We monitored milfoil and weevil popula tions prior to augmentation and are currently following populations in a manner si milar to that of Candlewood Lake. Unlike Candlewood Lake, Indian Lake already had an abundant weevil population prior to augmentation. Our preliminary data show that average weevil populations in the augmented areas were similar (1.25 weev ils/stem) to the non-augmented areas. Biological control of Eurasian milfoil, curly leaf pondweed and minor naiad with triploid grass carp in Grannis Lake, East Haven CT. This was the seventh year of st udy at Grannis Lake, which has the problematic populations of Eurasian watermilfoil, curly leaf pondweed and minor naiad. After many years of unsuccessful attempts to control the invasive species with herbicides, we introduced the plant 142 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 eating fish called grass carp ( Ctenopharyngodon idella ) 2007 (Figure 5). A total of 200 sterile (triploid) fish averagi ng 25 cm (10 inch) in length were introduced into the 20 acre lake. Over 200 georeferenced sites in the lake are being monitored for the effects of the grass carp on both native and invasive plant species. After no decr ease in vegetation in 2008 and 2009, our survey in May 2010 finally began to show the fish were beginning to reduce the invasive species. This is likely because the fish have now become large enough to consume large quantities of plant material. Molecular identification and population gene tics of invasive aquatic plants. Dr. Charles Vossbrinck is largely finished with developing a database of plant DNA sequences for molecular identification of the aquatic inva sive and native species . He has positively identified and sequenced at least one gene fr om 56 different aquatic plant species and has sequenced all three genes (small ribosomal subunit, internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA, atpB-rbcL spacer region) from 41 species. submitted 130 sequences to GenBank ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html ) where they are now available to researchers worldwide. He has discovered that for certain species, interference by other plant constituents make s DNA extraction difficult. Consequently, he has developed novel methods using ces ium chloride/ethidium bromide density gradients and ultracentrifugation to effec tively isolate and purify DNA bands. The database and molecular sequencing technology ha ve been used to identify or eliminate from possibility several aquatic plant isolates th is past year. We are anxious to apply this tool to the overall invasive plant program ove r the next two years to help us accurately identify the source of invasive aquatic plants in Connecticut. Dr. Charles Vossbrinck assisted by Kittyapong Prapayotin Riveros , has completed the isolation of 12 microsatellite markers fo r distinguishing different populations of the milfoil weevil ( E. lecontei) loci, they have obtained a rough 454 genomic sequence at the Yale Biotechnology Center for the E. lecontei genome. With that information, they were able to quickly develop more microsatellite loci . They will use these markers to examine differences among populations of this biological control ag ent in Connecticut water bodies. This information could be extremely valuable in determining how well the augmented weevil populations are doing in lakes as they can be differentiated from their native counterparts by small genetic differences. Greg Bugbee is working in cooperation with Dr. Ryan Thum at Grand Valley State University (Michigan) regarding genetic differences in variable leaf watermilfoil (Myriophyllum heterophyllum) that may be contributing to increased invasiveness. Variable milfoil is one of the most destructive invasive aquatic plants in Connecticut's lakes and ponds. Its color, density and their characteristic s differ from one place to another. Some of the differences are cause d by hybridization with other milfoil species such as loose watermilfoil (Myriophyllum laxum) . We have obtained milfoil plants from three genetically different types (genotype) of variable milfoil from lakes throughout the northeast. In June 2010, they were planted in 250 liter (100 gallon) tanks at the CAES research farm in Hamden and at Grand Valley State University in Michigan. At the end of the growing season, the plants will be ha rvested, and biomass will be determined and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 143 compared to the other genotypes. We hope to determine if there a genetic basis for invasive growth and if the hybrids are more invasive. Outreach . CAES strives to disseminate all information from our program to the public in a timely fashion and educate stakeholders in the identification, prevention and management of invasive aquatic species. Given the magnitude of invasion by non-native aquatic plants, we are making significant efforts to engage citizens, lake associations, and others as a part of this project (Figure 6). CAES scientists have given several workshops on the identification of invasive plants and how to control thes e weeds. We have assembled numerous publications that are freely av ailable in hard copy or el ectronically via our website (http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ). Included are digitized inte ractive maps of all surveyed lakes. In the 2009-2010 reporting period, CAES scientists gave 30 presentations to a variety of groups including professional or ganizations, such as the Northeast Aquatic Plant Management Society (NEAPMS), the Connecticut Conference on Natural Resources (CCNR), the North American La ke Management Society (NALMS), and local lake associations a nd other citizens' groups. Environmental Chemistry Effect of halide ions carbonates or ganic contaminant radical-based advanced oxidation processes. Dr. Joseph Pignatello in collaboration with William A. Mitch, Yale University. Advanced oxidation processes based on hydroxyl radical chemistry are being used more and more frequently to treat reclaimed waters and other challenging waters that often contain hi gh levels of salts including halide ions (Cl -, Br-, I-) and HCO 3- + CO 32-). These ions scavenge HO, such that AOP treatment of saline waters would be anticipated to be ineffective. However, HO scavenging by halides converts HO to radical reactive halogen species (RHS: X, X2-) and carbonate radical (CO 3-) that participate in contaminant destruction, but react more selectively with electron-ri ch organic compounds. The effects of Cl-, Br- and carbonates on the UV/H 2O2 treatment of model compounds in saline waters were evaluated. For single target organic contaminants, the suppression of contaminant destruction rate at circumneut ral pH followed the order: Br- > carbonates > Cl-. Traces of Br- in the NaCl stock had a greater effect than Cl- itself. Kinetic modeling of phenol destruction demonstrated that RHS contributed significantly to phenol destruction, mitigating the impact of HO scavenging by halide and carbonate constituents. The extent of treatment efficiency reduction in the presence of halides varied dramatically among different target organic compounds. Dest ruction of electron-poor contaminants in 144 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 seawater was nearly halted, while 17 -estradiol removal declined by only 3%. Mixtures of contaminants with each other and with natural organi c matter (NOM) were tested. Although NOM served as a scavenger of oxidants, conversion of non-selective HO to selective radicals due to th e presence of halide and carbona te anions enhanced the removal efficiency of electron-rich contamin ants by focusing the oxidizing power of the system away from NOM and towards the target contaminant. The formation of halogenated byproducts was obs erved but was minimal. The significance of these results is that th at the radical halogen and carbonate species formed in the scavenging process can themse lves contribute appreciably to contaminant destruction, mitigating the impact of hydroxyl scavenging. Moreover, in the presence of multiple contaminants, halide ions can change the selectivity of the AOP because RHS are generally more electr ophilic than hydroxyl. Hence, the degradation rate of contaminants with electron ri ch reaction centers will be less suppressed by halide ions than contaminants with el ectron poor reaction centers. Effects of Biochar on the Bioavailability of Agriculturally Important Chemicals. Dr. Joseph Pignatello in collaboration with Dr. Wade Elmer and Dr. Jason White . Biochar is a coined term for the car bonaceous byproduct of high-temperature technologies that convert biomass waste into liquid or gaseous fuels. It is similar in properties to pulverized charco al briquettes. Biochar has re cognized potentia l value as a soil amendment, as it appears to increase soil fertility in some cases. Also, due to its inherent stability in the environment (reporte d half life of several hundred years), biochar may serve as a form of 'sequestered carbon' that, if it were produced on a large scale, could reduce carbon dioxide emissions and help mitigate climate change. Due to their high surface area and microporous nature, char coal materials are strong adsorbents of organic compounds typically. Thus , a prerequisite to the wide scale use of biochar as a soil amendment in agriculture is a thorough assessment of its effects on the biological availability of agriculturally important chem icals in soil, such as pesticides, existing contaminants, and natural plant signaling chemicals (allelochemicals). Greenhouse tests were conducted on a bioc har from Dynamotive-USA. Two soils contaminated with the legacy pesticides chlordane and DDX (DDT + DDE + DDD) were amended with Dynamotive biochar at 0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10% (w/w) levels and then planted with zucchini ( Cucurbita pepo ). The amount of contaminant accumulated by the plants decreased significantly with increasing amounts of biochar. At the 10% amendment level, total chlordane and DDX content in the plan ts was reduced by 68 and 79%, respectively, relative to the control plants . At 10% biochar, there was an adverse effect on plant growth. We further studied the effects of biochar on the plant systems known to be impacted negatively by natural allelochemi cals. The addition of biochar (0.32, 1.60 and 3.20 % (w/w)) to asparagus soils infested with Fusarium root rot pathogens increased asparagus plant weights and reduced Fusari um root rot disease. The addition of allelochemicals (coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids exuded from asparagus roots) involved in plant-mycorrhizal fungi signaling processes did not affect plant weights or disease, but reduced root colonization by bene ficial mycorrhizae. However, the addition of biochar partially reduced the negative effect of the allelochemical mixture on The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 145 mycorrhizal colonization. Fina lly, the addition of biochar at 3.5% to the sand potting soil reduced the negative effect of juglone, an allelochemical exuded by black walnut and butternut, on tomato plant growth and stunting and wilting of the fruit. Findings provide convincing evidence that bioc har application to agricultural soil can, in specific circumstances, lower contaminant uptake by plants and reduce allelochemical activity. Artificial Cross-Linking of Humic Acids and Humic Substances in Soils: A Model for Aging of Soil Organic Matter. Dr. Joseph Pignatello in collaboration with Gabriele E. Schaumann, S\u00f6ren Thiele-Bruhn, and Jingdong Ma o. Humic substances can be regarded as macromolecular organic solids. In nature, humic substances undergo physical, chemical, and enzymatic alteration as they age. The formation of intermolecular bonds between strands by bridging groups (referred to as cross-linking) is believed to play an important role in the humification of soil organic matter. Crosslinking leads to an increase of the rigidity of the organic ma trix. We have successfully crosslinked a soil humic acid with Crosslinking was verified by water solubil ity tests and confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Sorption Mechanism of the Swine Antib iotic, Sulfamethazin e on Black Carbon. Dr. Joseph Pignatello in collaboration with Merc\u00e8 [SM; 4-amino- N-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl) benzenesulfonamide] is one of the most heavily used antibiotics in animal agriculture. Charcoal from natural and deliberate fires is a ubiquitous component of soils and a number of researchers have suggesting adding engineered charcoal (\"biochar\") to so il to improve soil fertility. Charcoal and black carbon materials in gene ral are typically powerful adsorbents of hydrophobic compounds. Compared to hydrophobic co mpounds, little is known about the adsorption of polar and ionizable compounds su ch as SM. Adsorption of SM to a series of biochars was studied to determine whethe r biochar amendment to soil could lower its bioavailability through enhanced adsorp tion. Depending on pH, hyd rophilic nature (log K ow0 = 0.27), the affinity of SM species for bi ochar is extraordinarily high (K BC0 up to 104 x KOC) and follows the order SM0 > SM+ > SM. Competition experiments indicate that cation exchange, anion exchange, ion pair sorption and coordination to surface metal ions are unimportant mechanisms. Strong competition by -acceptor molecules supports a contribution from /cation- interactions of the charge d anilinium group with surface graphene units. Do Contaminants Preferentially Interact with Adsorption Sites in Soil Organic Matter Based on Functional Group Identity? An NMR Study Using Stable Free Radical Probes. Dr. Joseph Pignatello in collaboration with Dr. Jingdong Mao. Soil organic matter is composed of lipid, carbohydrate-like, prot ein-like, lignin-like and black carbon-like functional units. A number of researchers have proposed that environmental contaminants show preferential sorpti on in soil organic matter depending on the similarity of their structure to the functi onal unit. For example, an aromatic compound 146 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 may preferentially interact with the lignin-li ke or black carbon-lik e units because such units are rich in aromatic functional groups. Ho wever, incorrect approaches were used to test this hypothesis and the results have been conflicting. We have st udied sorption of the nitroxyl spin tetramethyl-4-hydroxy-piperidi n-N-oxide (HTEMPO), to Pahokee peat soil, which is about 93% organic matter. TEMPO and HTEM PO are stable free radicals that cause relaxation of 13C transitions and signal suppression in the cross-polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS-NMR) spectrum. We found that sorption of either of these aliphatic compounds causes progressive relaxation of all peaks in the spectrum at the same rate with increasi ng probe concentration. This indicates no preferential sorption of these aliphatic spin probes to soil organic matter on the nanometer scale. Biological Control of Insect Pests A new parasite of stor ed grain pests. A microsporidian parasite that closely resembles Paranosema species at the level of the light microscope was isolated from the rusty grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus by Dr Charles Vossbrinck and colleagues from the USDA-ARS, Ma nhattan, KS. It's identity as N. oryzaephili (originally described from Orzaephilus surinamensis ) was confirmed by comparison with a known isolate of N. oryzaephili based upon spore size, small subunit small subunit rDNA indicated that this species belongs in the genus Paranosema and the designation Paranosema oryzaephili was proposed. In spite of the abundance, economic importance, and worl d-wide distribution of C. ferrugineus, this was the first report of a microsporidian infection in this insect species and the first record of P. oryzaephili in the new world. Redefinition of parasite of flies based on DNA analysis. Dr. Charles Vossbrinck and Dr. Theodore Andreadis conducted a comparative phylogenetic DNA analysis of the microsporidian parasite, Octosporea muscaedomesticae isolated from the blowfly Phormia regina and demonstrated that this para site is unrelated to other Octosporea species from unrelated hosts. Analyses with 38 other Microsporidia show that O. muscaedomesticae , differed from Octosporea parasite of the microcrustacean Daphnia magna) by 29%, thereby demonstrating that the latter microsporidium is not closely related to the fly para site at the generic level; O. muscaedomesticae should not be placed within the genus Octosporea, a conclusion that is further supported by morphological and developmental differences . Considering the number of disparately related hosts from which Octosporea species have been previously described based mostly on developmental and mo rphological characters, it is likely that The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 147 many will not fit the current definition of th e genus, and it is possible that molecular analysis of these species will show that this genus, as defined, represents a polyphyletic grouping of unrelated taxa. A new parasite of the teak moth . In conjunction with colleagues at the Institu te of Wood Science and Technology in Bangalore, India, Dr. Charles Vossbrinck reported the pathological e ffects of a spores were ovo- cylindrical and had a mean size of 5.1 to 2.8 mm. The midgut and fat body were the primary organs infected by the microsporidium. Subsequently, infec tion was observed in Malphigian tubules, The sequence of infection observed was: midgut - fat body - tracheal membrane - Malpighian t ubule - gonad. Infection with this microsporidium produced a marked negative e ffect on the growth and development of larvae. The weight of healt hy larvae increased about 22 tim es from the 3rd instar to pupation, while the increase was about 12 times in the infected larvae. Rearing experiments conducted in the laboratory revealed a high potential for horizontal transmission (.90%) of the microsporidiu m among the defoliator larvae developing together. A nearly equal degree of vertical transmission (88.7%) was also observed from the infected females to the progeny larvae. Findings indicate the prospect of the microsporidium as a bio-control agent against the defoliator pest if exploited properly. Small subunit rRNA gene sequence analysis reve aled that this micr osporidium differed from Nosema bombycis of silk moth by only two nucleotid es. The teak moth and the silk moth are not as closely related as these two parasites appear to be, implying the likelihood of host switching. Phylogenetic analysis and superoxide dismutase from Microsporidia. Working with colleagues at the Southwest University in Chongqing, China, Dr. Charles Vossbrinck is unraveling the true identity of the microsporid ia (important parasites of insects). What Microsporidia actually are stil l eludes us. They may be related to the fungi or they may be a eukaryotic life form all their own. They are a group of obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites with small genomes and th ey infect animals from a wide variety of phyla, including humans. Two manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) genes, designated and NbMnSOD2 , a ta ndem array within the Nosema bombycis genome. The genes, both 678 bp in length, were found to be more similar to each other than they are to homologous genes of other Microsporidia, suggesting that the tandem dupli cation occurred after the deve lopment of this lineage. Superoxide dismutase is a protective enzyme that changes the reactive radical superoxide to peroxide and then to water. Since this enzyme is found in all life forms, we chose it for comparative analysis. They compared the superoxide dismutase protein sequence from Microsporidia with those of bacteria, plants, animals, fungi, and protozoa and found evidence that Microsporidia are either a very different group of organisms or that genes have been transferred from bact erial species into their cells. 148 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Soil Testing Testing soil samples for fer tility and suggesting methods for growing better plants ar e a continuing service for citizens of Connecticut. At the laboratory in New Haven, Greg Bugbee tested 5,581 samples and answered 1,850 related inquiries Impact. The soil testing services and suggestions made by The Connecticut Agricult ural Experiment Station reduce unnecessary fertilizer treatments to lawn s and nursery stock throughout the state. This provides direct economic and environm ental benefit to the suburban community by reducing nitrogen runoff into soil and water. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 149 DEPARTMENT OF FORES TRY AND HORTICULTURE Connecticut's landscape is a quilt of forests, fa rms, towns, and cities. Scientists in the Department of Forestry and Horticulture are studying the factors that influence both forest and farm productivity, including novel specia lty crops, grapes, a nd the effect of the growing deer population on natu ral and managed landscapes. Investigation of new crops is essential to provide new opportunities for farmers during a time of changing agriculture in Connecticut. The number of tobacco and dairy farms in Connecticut has declined dramatically in the last four decades. However, the number of vegetable farms increased from 579 in 1992 to 582 in 2002. Today, about 11,000 acres in Connecticut are devoted to ve getable production. In 2004, the ca sh value of all vegetable crops grown on approximately 10,000 acres in Connecticut was 24.8 million dollars, this compares to 16.2 million dollars in 1999. The marketing of produce in Connecticut has sh ifted from wholesale contracts with local supermarkets to direct retail sales. Appr oximately 441 farms offer direct sales through roadside stands and sales rooms, where a vari ety of fruit, vegetabl es, nursery stock, and Christmas trees are offered. About 36 of these are open all year. Nearly 30% of these farms offer pick-your-own fruit and vegetables to reduce the cost of harvest labor. These savings are passed on to the consumer. The development of a network of farmers' ma rkets in Connecticut's major urban centers and densely populated suburbs is an important segment of dir ect sales of vegetables to consumers. All produce sold at farmers' ma rkets must be \"Connect icut Grown\". Farm fresh produce is offered at reasonable prices to urbanites who cannot travel to the farms. Niche crops valued by diverse ethnic groups ar e generally sold through these markets. In 2009, there were 130 farmers' markets attended by over 400 farmers compared to 122 markets in 2010 up from 87 in 2007. Many farmers wish to diversify their operations by growing ethnic and specialty vegetables, but little information on the culture of these vegetables in Connecticut is available. Direct retail sales and small farm sizes requi re that the farmer grow diversified high- value crops. Since 1982, The Connecticut Agri cultural Experiment Station has been investigating specialty crops to provide new opportunities for Connecticut's farmers. Over 40 fruits and vegetables have been st udied resulting in over 50 publications. Some of the crops studied in the New Crops Program include glob e artichoke, Belgian endive, radicchio, heirloom tomatoes, sweet potatoes, specialty melons, okra, and tomatillos. Research included variety trials and experiments to determine the best cultural methods for growing each specific crop in Connecticut. Crops that were chosen have a high market value and an existing or expanding ma rket that would readily accommodate these commodities. Heirloom Tomato Trials: Interest and sales of heirl oom tomatoes have increased dramatically in the past 10 years. More and more consumers are willing to forego 150 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 appearance for that real old-fashioned tomato taste. Knowledge of high-yielding cultivars and cultural details would be nefit growers, especially those who serve inner city consumers who purchase these vegetables at local farmers' markets throughout the Northeast. But growing heirloom tomatoes can be a challenge. Heirlooms tend to have poor disease resistance and have lower yields when compared to hybrid tomatoes. They are also more susceptible to crack ing due to their tender skin. In 2009, Dr. Maynard evaluated ten cultivars of ethnic heirloom to matoes for yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: Yields of Dr. Wyche's Yellow and Kentucky Beefsteak (26 lbs and 24 lbs/plant, respectively) were greatest. At a retail price of $1.99/lb, there is a potential crop value of over $167,000/A. Virtually a ll farmers' markets h ave at least one heirloom tomatoes grower. The long-term benefits of growing heirloom tomatoes include an additional product and rev enue for growers who attend farmers' markets or have their own roadside stands. Calabaza - Selection for Early Maturity: Calabaza squash, also known as tropical pumpkin, is mostly grown in tropical and semi-tropical climates. Calabaza is highly prized by consumers of Hispanic origin. It was identified by the Connecticut Department of Agriculture as one of the most sought-a fter items at Connecticut's 114 farmers' markets. We are developing a cultivar that produces fruit on shorter vines by saving seeds from plants that have produced fruit within 2 feet of the plant. Thes e seeds are planted at Lockwood Farm and Windsor and selections ar e again made. Fruit that mature on short vines is appealing to northern growers because the majority of fruit can mature before frost. Fruit that form on longer vines do not al ways reach maturity. Last year, 82% of the plants at Windsor produced fruit within 2 feet of the plant compared to 37% of the plants at Lockwood Farm. Selections will continue for several more years. Impact: Seeds from our selections have been distributed to several commercial growers and backyard gardeners intereste d in growing calabaza. Yields in 2009 were 21,490 lbs/A. At a retail price of $0.99 /lb, there is a potential crop value of $21,275/acre. The long-term benefits incl ude additional revenue for farmers, especially those who attend farmers markets in urban areas. Personal-Sized Watermelons Trials: The newest melons on the marketplace are seedless miniature \"personal\" watermelons, weighing 3-7 pounds each. Personal-sized watermelons offer an attractive alternative for small families or for consumers that have limited refrigerator space. Beside the smalle r size, they also have a thinner rind, which reduces waste. In addition, researchers ha ve found that lycopene and beta-carotene contents are abundant in personal-sized waterm elons. Lycopene, an antioxidant, has been linked to the possible prevention of cancer and heart disease. In 2009, Dr. Maynard evaluated nine cultivars of personal sized seedless watermelon for yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Unlike othe r sized watermelons, personal-sized watermelons are sold by the melon, not by th e pound. Therefore, estimated yields were measured in number of fruit per plant. Even though they were advertised to be personal sized cultivars, Snack Pack and Big Tasty produced no fruit in the 3-7 lb personal sized The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 151 range. Bravo (3.7 fruit/plant), Mielhart (2.8 fruit/plant), Vanessa (2.6 fruit/plant), and Leopard (2.4 fruit/plant) had the greatest yields at both sites. Vanessa (11.4) and Bravo (11.1) averaged the highest Brix values. Impact: By growing the cultivar Bravo instead of Vanessa, the grower can produce over 10,600 more personal-sized watermelons per acre. At $4.99 retail price/fruit, the grower would potentially gross over $53,000 more per acre by growing Bravo instead of the standard cultivar Vaness a. A grower in Bethel included Bravo in his plantings instead of another cultivar. The long-term benefits of growing personal- sized watermelon include additional reve nue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. In addi tion, there may be health benefits for those who consume watermelon. Vegetable Amaranth Trials: Vegetable Amaranth (Callaloo) is an annual that is native to central Mexico. In Asia and the West Indies , amaranth is widely used in soup. Although it is relatively unknown as a vegetable crop in the United States, it has traditionally been cultivated throughout the humid tropics and is consumed extensively in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America. The greens ar e of considerable nut ritional value being high in calcium, magnesium, iron, vitami ns A and C as well as protein. In 2009, Dr. Maynard evaluated 8 vegetable amaranth cult ivars at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact : All Red (3.7 lbs/plant), Red Stripe Leaf (3.3 lbs/plant), and Tender Leaf (2.6 lbs/plant) averaged the greatest yields. At a retail price of $0.99/lb, there is a potential crop value of $35,816/acre. High yi elds of a quality product will benefit local growers and consumers by providing revenue for farmers, a nutritious food for consumers, and preservation of farmla nd. A grower in Bloomfield now supplies a local school system with hi s crop of vegetable amaranth. Sweet Potato Trials: A 1998 Connecticut Department of Ag riculture survey showed that sweet potato is one of the most popular spec ialty vegetables. In the South, the sweet potato is also called yam, but both are iden tical species. In the United States, North Carolina and Louisiana are the leading producers, but we have found that they can easily be grown in Connecticut. This crop has bot h a high market value and an expanding market. In addition, it is very nutritious, with high values of beta carotene (vitamin A) and vitamin C. In 2009, Dr. Maynard evaluated several cultivars that have short maturities (90 days) at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: Carolina Ruby averaged the greatest yields (3.3 lbs/plant) with both Beauregard and Red Japanese averaging 3.1 lbs/plant. At a retail price of $0.79/lb, there is a potential crop value of $37,854/acre. Beauregard is the most popular cultivar grown in Connecticut. The long-te rm benefits of grow ing sweet potatoes include additional revenue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume sweet potatoes. 152 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Specialty Pumpkin Trials: The typical predominant market for pumpkins is for jack-o'- lantern types (12 lbs to 20 lbs). However, sm all pumpkins are often needed for operations specializing in school tours wh ere each child receives a pumpkin to take home. Smooth pumpkins are preferred for painting or colo ring. Specialty pumpkins come in a wide range of colors and color combinations in cluding white, pale gr een, tan, burnt orange, and yellow. Shape also varies from the ideal round, to squatty with a flattened or concave top, to oval, to tall and elongated. In 2009, Dr. Maynard evaluated 13 different varieties of specialty pumpkins on yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: Gooligan (8.9 fruit/plant), Lil' Pump (7.6 fruit/plant), Baby Boo (7.3 fruit/plant), and Hooligan (7.2 fruit/plant) had the greatest yields. At a retail price of $1.00/pumpkin, there is a potential crop value of $32,307/acre. Many Connecticut farmers are now including some of these cultivars in addition to growing Jack-O- Lanterns. The long-term benefits of growing specialty pumpkins include an additional product and revenue for grow ers who attend farmers markets or have their own roadside stands. Pak Choi Trials : From 2000 to 2006, the Asian population in Connecticut grew 42%. This and other ethnic groups wish to con tinue consumption of vegetables that are customarily in their diets, thereby givi ng farmers opportunities for production of crops with a ready market. Ethnic vegetables also appeal to high-end buyers for whom ethnic vegetables are not every day fare, but who enjoy gourmet produce and culinary variety. Many farmers wish to diversify their operati ons by growing ethnic vegetables, but there is little information on the culture of these vegetables in Connecticut. In 2009, Dr. Maynard evaluated 6 different varieties of pak choi on yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. The average yield at Lock wood Farm (loamy upland soil) was 14.0 t/A compared to 9.4 t/A at Windsor (sandy terrace soil). Impact: In spring, Joi Choi (4.2 lbs/plant) and Black Sum mer (3.4 lbs/plant) had the greatest yields. At a retail price of $0.99 /lb, there is a potential crop value of $40,656/acre. The cultivar Bonsai bolted at both sites in the spring and was unmarketable. A farmer growing Bonsai in the spring would have had a crop failure resulting in no income. Most Connecticut farmers are now growing the cultivar Joi Choi. In fall, Win-Win Choi (3.6 lbs/plant) and Bonsai (3.2 lbs/plant) had the greatest yields with a potential crop value of $34,848/acre. The long-term benefits include additional revenue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. Edamame Trials: Edamame are specialty varieties of soybeans that are harvested in the green stage. The word \"edamame\" means \"bean s on branches\" and it grows in clusters on bushy branches. Edamame is consumed as a snack, a vegetable dish, used in soups or processed into sweets. As a sn ack, the pods are lightly boiled in salted water, and then the seeds are squeezed directly from the pods into the mouth with the fingers. Outside East Asia, edamame is most often found in Japanese restaurants and some Chinese restaurants, but it has also found popularity elsewh ere as a healthy food item. In 2009, Dr. Maynard The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 153 evaluated seven cultivars of edamame for yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: The cultivar Green Legend had the g reatest yield (0.92 lbs pods/plant). At a retail price of $2.49/lb, there is potent ial crop value of over $133,000/acre. By growing the cultivar Green Legend instead of the cultivar Envy, the grower can potentially produce over 45,000 more po unds per acre or gross almost $113,000 more per acre. A few farmers in Conn ecticut are now growing edamame. Specialty Fruit Variety Trials : As wholesale marketing of major tree fruits becomes unprofitable, many Connecticut growers are turni ng to retail sales of their fruit. For a retail operation to be succe ssful there must be a dive rsity of products. Thus, many growers are interested in adding minor specialty fruits to their operations. In response to this grower interest, Dr. Maynard in 2001 expanded the New Crops Program at the Station to include fruits. The trial includes 12 cultivar/rootstoc k combinations of Japanese plum at both Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: The greatest yields in 2009 were from Shiro (71 lb/tree) and Obilnaja (45 lb/tree). At a retail price of $1.99/lb, a pl anting of 242 Shiro trees per acre would yield a potential crop value of $34,192/acre. Three Connecticut orchards are growing Station-supplied Shiro trees with great success. Long-term benefits include diversification and greater profits for fruit growers. At the request of fruit growers, 306 beach plum seedlings were planted in 2003 at the Station's two experimental re search farms. These seedlings were raised at Cornell University from seeds collected from 35 sites from Maine to Delaware. Impact: In 2009, heavy yielding plants produced as much as 26 lb/plant. At a retail price of $2.00/lb, there is an expected crop value of $52,270/acre. The immediate impact is that growers at two of Connect icut's largest farms are now growing beach plums, which can be made into a premiu m jam which sells for $6.40 for an 8 ounce jar. Long-term benefits include farm diversification and greater profits for fruit growers. Sheet Composting of Oak and Maple Leaves: Many municipalities in Connecticut with leaf collection programs in the fall are turn ing to farmers to dispose of their leaves. However, not all farmers have extra land to set aside for a standard composting operation. Instead, they layer und ecomposed leaves on their fields and simply plow them under. This is called sheet composting. Nitrogen deficiency can be a problem in these soils because microorganisms involved in leaf d ecomposition use nitrogen more efficiently than plants. There is some question whether the differences in the rates of decomposition between oak and maple leaves would lead to differences in plant response when these leaves are used in a sheet composting operati on. This is also a situ ation that confronts many home gardeners who have a predomin ance of oaks in their backyards. 154 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 To help answer this question, Dr. Abigail Maynard conducted a sheet composting experiment in which plots were amended with either all oak or all maple leaves. Undecomposed leaves were layered about 6 inches thick in the falls of 1994-2008 and incorporated into the soil by rototilling. Last year, lettuce, peppers, onions, and carrots were grown with all plots r eceiving the same amount (1300 lb/A) of 10-10-10 fertilizer. Yields from plots amended with oak leaves were compared to plots amended with maple leaves and the unamended controls. In 2009, lettuce yields from the control plots and plots amended with maple leaves were slightly greater (1.5 lbs/head) compared to yields from plots amended with oak leaves (1.3 lbs/ head). The greatest pe pper yields were from the plots amended with maple leaves (4.7 lbs/plant) followed by plots amended with oak leaves and the unamended control plots (4.6 a nd 4.5 lbs/plant, respectively). The greatest carrot yields were from the control plot ( 3.4 lbs/10 ft row) followed by plots amended by oak leaves (3.2 lbs/10 ft row) and plots ame nded with maple leaves (2.6 lbs/10 ft row). The greatest onion yields were from the plots amended with maple leaves (17.4 lbs/10 ft row) followed by the control plots (16.0 lbs/10 ft row) and plots amended with oak leaves (14.1 lbs/10 ft row). Impact: Many Connecticut homeowners a re now disposing of their oak and maple leaves in their gardens without worrying abou t any deleterious effects on yields in their vegetable gardens. Incorporating tr ee leaves into gardens improves the environment by storing carbon in the so il and reducing the volume of material in the solid waste collection and disposal system. Winegrape growers and Farm Wineries in Connecticut face many challenges. Farm Wineries are required to grow a minimum of 25% of the fruit in their total output, but are having trouble meeting this standard. C onsecutive very cold wi nters in 2003 and 2004 resulted in significant plant loss on less cold-har dy cultivars. This drove up prices for purchasing Connecticut fruit. Little informati on is available to growers regarding cultural information for growing more cold-hardy and di sease-resistant cultivars in the state. Growers of more traditional cultivars require more information on crop regulation and fruit quality. Disease management is critical during the growing season due to Connecticut's warm, humid summers. The i ndustry requires incr eased production via better management practices in existing vine yards and improved cult ivar selection in newly planted vineyards. Innovative practices need to be tested in Connecticut to assess their viticultural and economic appropriateness. Winegrapes: Studies have been initiated by Dr. William R. Nail from 2004-2010 to help determine cultural practices for growing high quality winegrapes profitably in Connecticut. The winegrape industry in C onnecticut is one of the most rapidly expanding categories of agricultu re in the state. The first Farm Winery opened in 1979, and there are currently over 30 wineries with a Farm Winery license , with two or three more scheduled to open each year in the fo reseeable future. The existence of these wineries adds substantially to local economie s, as local restaurants, hotels, bed and breakfasts, and other establishments receive increased business due to their proximity. The Connecticut Wine Trail brochure, pub lished by the Connecticut Vineyard and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 155 Winery Association, is the most popular br ochure in Department of Tourism travel offices. Cultural practices in Vitis vinifera : Dr. Nail established a planting of 288 Pinot Gris vines at Lockwood Farm in summer, 2004. Two different rootstocks were used: 3309C, the most commonly planted rootstock in the state, and 101-14, which may tend to ripen fruit earlier and have better tole rance to severe winter freezes. Impact: Vines grafted to 101-14 had 32% less mortality due to winter freeze damage than those grafted to 3309C following their first winter. Crown gall (caused by a bacterium) in subsequent years conti nues to be slightly higher in 3309C vines, although severity has not been enough to warrant removal of vines. Planting on rootstocks more resistant to winter damage can result in savings of $7.60 for each year of lost production per vine, plus $3.75 replacement cost per vine plus labor involved in removing diseased vines and replanting. Approximately 60% of new plantings of V. vinifera cultivars consist of vines gr afted to 101-14 instead of 3309C, as opposed to less than 20% in 2004. Effects of graft union height: Freeze damage to grafted grap evines frequently occurs at the graft union, which is t ypically very close to the ground. Crown gall (caused by a bacterium) frequently occurs on severely freeze-damaged vines, although symptoms may not appear for one or two years after the freeze event. Elevating the height of the graft union may result in less injury. Chardonna y clone 96 budwood was grafted onto 3309C rootstock at standard height and 26 inches higher in 2006, and vines were transplanted in spring 2007 to vineyards at Lockwood Farm a nd Westport, Massachusetts. Vines have been evaluated for bud fruitfulness, winter freeze damage, and crown gall incidence and severity beginning in 2008. Yield and fruit quality were evaluated beginning in 2009. Impact: Yields on high-grafted vines w ere much greater than those of low-grafted vines in 2009, the first year of production. Th is increase in yield, even if only for one year, may offset the increased cost of plan t material. Vines with crown gall typically require replacement at some point. Planting on rootstocks more resistant to winter damage can result in savings of $7.60 for each year of lost produc tion per vine, plus $3.75 replacement cost per vine plus labor for vine removal and replanting. High- grafted vines may result in significant re duction in such losses, which would be approximately $2,150 plus labor for each 10% of vine mortality. This practice has not yet been adopted by most Connecticut growers pending the long-term results from these experiments and the two-year period required between ordering custom- grafted plants and their availability for planting in the vineyard. Funding for this project was obtained from the Viticu lture Consortium East for 2006 and 2008-2010. Training and pruning effects on vine performance of hybrid cultivars: Grapevines in most older vineyards in Conn ecticut are planted on six-f oot spacing and trained to a vertically shoot-positioned system. This ha s generally worked well for most vinifera cultivars and some hybrids. Recently released hybrid cultivars that are rapidly finding 156 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 favor frequently have different growth ha bits that make them unsuitable for this traditional spacing and training. Within-row spacing of grapevines in the vineyard is one of the most critical decisions to be made at planting. Too close spacing re sults in excessive competition and excessive vegetative growth, leading to reduced yields of poor quality fruit. Sp acing that is too far apart results in unproductive utilization of valuable vine yard space. The choice of spacing is permanent. However, errors made at planting can sometimes be partially remedied by dividing the canopy to accommoda te vine growth. Divided canopies can increase yield per unit of linear row length, but are more difficult and labor-intensive to establish and maintain. To evaluate spacing and traini ng systems for new cultivars, Dr. Nail established a new planting of the hybrid cultivars St. Croix a nd Cayuga White in May, 2005 at a private grower's vineyard in Wallingford. These cultivars are among the most popular hybrids for new plantings. They have different gr owth habits and management issues than vinifera cultivars, which may involve fundamental issues bot h before and after planting. Plants of both cultivars were planted at six and eight foot spacings, and were trained to four different training syst ems beginning in 2009: Verti cally Shoot Positioned (VSP), Hudson River Umbrella (HRU), Geneva Doubl e Curtain (GDC), and Scott Henry. Those on six-foot spacing will also be pruned to both cane and cordon systems in future years. Impact: In 2009, the first year of data co llection, vines trained to Scott Henry had the highest yields, approximately 19% higher than VSP. HRU and GDC had much lower yields, as the vines had not yet become permanently established on the relatively high wires required for these syst ems. This could be very important for growers striving for maximum pr oductivity early in the life of a vineyard. However, the long-term effects of the various tr aining systems, once the HRU and GDC systems are well established, have yet to be determined. The results of this study will allow both new and existing growers to help maximize their production, as well as possibly demonstrating that some syst ems are not efficient in Connecticut for certain cultivars. Approximately 12 a cres of newly planted St. Croix and approximately 7 acres of newly planted Cayuga White are being trained to high wire training systems (GDC and HRU) base d on the preliminary results of these experiments. Pruning systems: Most grapevines in Connecticut ha ve traditionally been cane pruned. Cane pruning requires skilled labor, which is increasingly in short supply. Spur pruning to a cordon system requires skilled labor, whic h is increasingly in short supply. Spur pruning to a cordon system requires less skilled labor and lends itself to mechanization. A planting of the hybrid cultivars Chambourcin, Seyval Blanc, Villard Blanc, and Villard Noir at Lockwood Farm was rejuvenated in 2004, and vines were either cordon or cane pruned in 2005 through 2009 to compare the relative efficiencies of these pruning methods. Yield and fruit quality paramete rs were determined beginning in the 2005 harvest season. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 157 Impact: Cordon pruning is a viable alternative to the cane pruning method used in most Connecticut vineyards. Skilled labo r costs, essential to cane pruning, are approximately 30% higher than unskilled labo r costs. Of equal importance is the increasing unavailability of skilled labor. Ov er the course of this experiment, there were no differences in yield, fruit quality, or any measured vegetative parameters measured between cane and cordon pruned vines. Therefore, cordon pruning can reduce pruning costs by approximately 30% for growers. Approximately 45 acres of vinifera and hybrid winegrapes have b een converted to cordon training to reduce cost and efficiency for growers. Cultivar and clonal evaluation: Beginning in 2004, Dr. Nail has evaluated previously established experimental plots at Lockwood Farm and a private grower's vineyard in Shelton. The planting at Lockwood Farm c ontains the white hybrid cultivars Seyval Blanc and Villard Blanc and the red hybrid cu ltivars Chambourcin and Villard Noir. The white cultivars have consistently had highe r yields than the re d cultivars (7.9 vs. 3.7 tons/acre, respectively). However, red grap es are usually in higher demand due to the cool-climate conditions in Connecticut. The private vineyard plot consists of the red Bordeaux cultivars Cabernet Franc, Cabe rnet Sauvignon, and Merlot. Cabernet Sauvignon has displayed high vine mortality and relatively poor fruit quality due to lack of maturity. Growers have generally agreed that this cultivar is unsuitable for Connecticut conditions, and no si gnificant new plantings are be ing established. Cabernet Franc and Merlot have both consistently produced good quality fru it, although yields in Merlot were slightly lower (4.3 vs 4.0 t ons/acre, respectively). While there have sometimes been differences among clone and rootstock performance, growing season effects were more significant. New cultivar trials were established at Lockwood Farm and the Valley Laboratory in spring, 2008, in conjunction with the national project \"NE-1020: Multista te Evaluation of Winegrape Cultivars and Clones\". This project involves over 50 scientists from over 30 states, allowing for evaluation of regional comparisons of vegetative and fruit qualities. The planting at Lockwood Farm is the third largest planting in the Eastern United States. Both plantings contain established cultivars whose characteristics have been documented, as well as unreleased and untested cultivars whose performance in Connecticut are unknown. Data collection on these vines began w ith pruning results in spring 2010, and will continue for several years. Impact: The white hybrid cultivars in question had approximately 50% higher yields than the red cultivars. However, high quality red winegrapes are in greater demand, so they may command a price high enough to justify their production for growers planning to sell their fruit. While Cabernet Sauvignon is not a viable cultivar option, both Cabernet Franc and Merlot have produced good yields of high quality fruit suitable for premium wines. Five acres of Cabernet Sauvignon have been replaced with 3.5 acres of Cabernet Franc and 1.5 acres of Merlot, which should produce their first crops in 2011. There have been no new plantings of Villard Blanc or Villard Noir since 2006, and only seven additional acres of Seyval, while Chambourcin acreage has increased by 16 acres during the past four years. 158 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 The NE-1020 plots will provide Connecticut growers with valuable information on the suitability of new cultivars to th e area. Viticultural and fruit quality characteristics are important when a new cultivar is introduced into a region. The results of these trials will allow growers to make informed decisions as to the selection of appropriate new cultivars, if and when they are released, and their cultural requirements. The unbalanced age class distri bution of the oak-hickory fo rest, and most individual forest stands, presents a chal lenge to both private and public forest landowners wishing to implement sustainable forest management. Three factors are driving the necessity of developing innovative alternatives to \"high-grading\" or initiat ing regeneration harvests in these stands: obtaining a more ba lanced age-structure, increa sed public desire for partial cutting, and increased parcel ization of ownership. Crop-tree management has been proven successful in younger oak stands and c ould be a viable alte rnative in older oak sawtimber stands where maintaining high fore st cover and non-comm odity attributes are important considerations. Crop-tree management : In 2003, Dr. Jeffrey Ward began a study to determine if crop tree management would increase growth of large, mature oak sawtimber (> 18 inches diameter) without a loss in bole quality and stand growth rates in cooperation with CT DEP-Division of Forestry, Metropolitan Di strict Commission, a nd Torrington Water Company. Six study sites were established in fully-stocked, mature oak forests. The mature red oak sawtimber stands had no prior management, were 80-112 year-old, and diameters of upper canopy oaks averaged 17.2 in ches. Each study site has three treatment areas of approximately 5 acres. Treatments are 1) an uncut control; 2) crop trees released from upper canopy competition on three or four sides, no other trees cut; and 3) crop trees released on one or two sides as part of a crown thinning to 60 ft 2/acre of basal area. Treatments were randomly assigned after crop tree selection. At least twenty-five crop trees (~10/acre) were selected on each treatm ent area. Selection criteria for crop trees were: red oak group ( Quercus rubra, Q. velutina, or Q. coccinea), codominant or dominant crown class, at least 17 ft to first fork, diameter > 18 inches, and potential grade 1 buttlog. Crop trees were banded with orange paint. Tree measurements were completed following the 2004 growing season. A 50x50m plot was located within each treatment area to monitor changes in stand volume growth. All trees with diameters > 4 inches were banded with red paint. A tota l of 2613 trees have been measured. Harvesting has been completed on four of the study areas. Tree di ameters have been measured annually and a preliminary assessment of treatment effects was completed in late 2009. Basal area was reduced from 138 ft 2/acre prior to harvest to 77 and 72 ft2/acre on the B- level and crop tree management plots, respect ively. For all size classes combined, basal area growth over the next 5 years was greates t in the crop tree plots, followed by B-level thinning, and finally unmanaged controls. Conc urrently, sawtimber basal area growth did not differ among treatments and averaged 1.3 ft2/acre/year suggesting management can maintain stand volume growth rates. Relativ e to 5-yr diameter growth of upper canopy The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 159 oaks on unmanaged plots (0.9 inches), diam eter growth increased by 29 percent on B- level thinning and 54 percent on crop tr ee management plots to 1.1 and 1.3 inches, respectively. Diameter growth increase wa s related to degree of crown release. Completely released trees grew more than pa rtially released trees, which in turn, grew more than trees that were not released. Impact: Crop-tree release provides a manage ment tool to develop stands with a balanced age structure in public forests and for private forest owners for whom high forest cover and non-commodities at tributes are important considerations. Connecticut Department of Environm ental Protection, Forestry Division incorporated this research in the 96 acres of TSI treatment during 2009-2010. Two major threats to natural preserves and ma naged forests are exotic plant species and browsing by overabundant white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus). Therefore, scientists in the Department of Forestry a nd Horticulture are examining both effects of these two threats, and possible strategies to minimize their impacts and thereby enhance forest ecosystem services. Japanese barberry control : Japanese barberry is listed as invasive in 20 states and 4 Canadian provinces and is associated with enhanced population densities of blacklegged ticks that can transmit the cau sal agent of Lyme disease. Drs. Ward and Williams continued their studies of a lternative methods to control Japanese barberry begun in 2006. This research both evaluated the effectiveness and relative costs among treatment combinations to control Japanese barberry, a nd by monitoring individual clumps across a range of size classes, assessed whether treatment prescriptions are dependent on clump size. Beginning in March 2007, a two-step process to control barberry wa s studied at six study areas. Two study areas were establishe d on a Regional Water Authority (RWA) watershed in North Branford, CT. Two study areas were establishe d on the Centennial Watershed State Forest in Redding, CT that is jointly managed by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, The Nature Conservancy, and the Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut. One st udy area was established on The Nature Conservancy lands in Salisbury, CT. The sixt h study area was established in Storrs, CT on the University of Connecticut Experiment Forest. All study areas had extensive stands of mature Japanese barbe rry. Initial treatments in sp ring 2007 (prescribed burning, mechanical mowing with a brush saw or drum chopper) reduced the size of established barberry clumps. Follow-up treatments in mid-summer 2007 to kill new ramets that developed from surviving root crowns were fo liar application of triclopyr or glyphosate, directed heating with a propane torch, and untreated controls. Mortality was defined as the absence of ramets from a root crown and not the mortality of individual ramets of a given clump. Within each subplot, percent barberry cover was measured utilizing a 0.5 m 2 sampling instrument which consisted of a 4 x 4 grid with which percent barberry cover was determined by presence/absence within each cell. There were 100 sample points for each 160 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 treatment combination for a to tal of 4400 points. Labor hours, fuel, chemical and material costs, and equipment and purchase expenses were tracked for all initial and follow-up treatments. Surviving barberry with no follow-up treatment recovered to half the original coverage by the end of the first growing season. Re ductions in percent barberry cover were significant for plots receiving follow-up treatm ents compared to no follow up after two growing seasons. There was no significant difference in percent c over reduction between follow-up treatments; all treatment combinati ons reduced Japanese barberry cover by an average of 96%. Excellent cover-reduction of Japanese barberry can be achieved using either propane torches or herbicides as follow-up treatments in a two-step process where barberry is initially treated by mechanical means. Although requiring a greater labor-time investment, propane torches provide a non-ch emical alternative in parks, nature preserves, forests, or other ecologically sens itive areas where herbic ide use is restricted and where barberry infestations are still light. Developing a cost-effective method of controlling Japanese barberry will allow forest owners to maximize the area treated each year. This research has been partly funded by Aquarion Water Company, Re gional Water Authority, The Nature Conservancy, Norcross Wildlife Foundation , Town of Greenwich, Town of Mansfield, Propane Education and Resea rch Council, Propane Gas Association of New England, and USDA NRCS. Additional support has been provided by Great Mountain Forest, Guilford Land Conservation Trust, Joshua's Land and Historic Trust, Providence (RI) Water, and White Memorial Foundation. Our cooperators collectively manage over 85,000 acres that include extensive areas of barberry. Impact: Last year, invasive plants were treated on over 450 acres in Connecticut. Propane torches have been purchased to control barberry on lands managed by Connecticut DEP-Wildlife Division ( 22,000 acres), Colebrook Land Conservancy (566 acres), Northern Connecticut Land Trust (435 acres), New Hartford Conservation Commission (171 acres), a nd numerous private forest owners. Requests for information about this technique have also been received from the USDA Forest Service (Pennsylvania and New Hampshire), NRCS (Connecticut and Rhode Island), New York City - DEP Bureau of Water Supply, Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge (Maine), Anacostia Watershed Society (Maryland), private natural resource managers, and the general public. Japanese Barberry Infestations Serve as a Refuge for Blacklegged Ticks: In many Connecticut forests with an the dominant understory shrub. This exotic invasive shrub provides ha bitat favorable to blacklegged determine mouse and larval tick abundances at five replicate sites, Drs. Williams and Ward have been trapping mice since 2007 in unmanipulated dense barberry infestations, areas where barberry was controlled, and areas where ba rberry was minimal or abse nt. The number of feeding larval ticks/mouse was recorded. Adult and nymphal ticks were sampled along permanent The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 161 draglines in each treatment, retaine d, and were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal agent of Lyme di sease in humans and pets. The number of captured mice did not differ between treatments. However, the average number of feeding larval ticks per mouse was highest on mice captured in dense barberry (7.5 larvae/mouse). Adult tick densities in dens e barberry (125/acre) were higher than in both controlled (64/ acre) and no barberry (21/acre full barberry infestations a nd controlled barberry areas had similar infection overall prevalence with B. burgdorferi , 52 and 53% respectiv ely. Adult tick infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi varied widely between treatments and study areas, but was lowest in areas where barberry was absent and generally lower where barberry was controlled. This in concert with the overall reduction in the a dult tick cohort in areas where barberry was controlled resulted in 113 B. burgdorferi -infected ticks/acre in dense barberry, 49/acre where barberry was controlled, and 12/acre where barberry was absent. Results indicate that managing Japanese barb erry will have a positive effect on public health by reducing the number of B. burgdorferi infected blacklegged ticks that can develop into motile life stages that commonly feed on humans. Mouse trapping and tick sampling efforts will continue for several mo re years to monitor long-term effects of controlling Japanese barberry. This research is not only of interest from an ecological perspective, but also serves to scientifically document the potential negat ive impacts an invasive plant can have on human health. This research has been featu red on gardening websites and multiple forest land managers have used it to st rengthen their argument for the increased need to control invasive plants. Results from this research will lead to improved interest in the control of invasives, and ultimately, a reduction in the number of ticks capable of causing Lyme disease in humans and domesticated animals. Various entities within the towns of Redding, Weston, Easton, Guilford, Greenwich, Hampton, and Mansfield and in the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York have used these results in part to justify equipment purchase and initiate or reinvigorate invasive plant control programs Interaction of Deer Browse and Barberry Infestations: The Japanese barberry ( Berberis thunbergii ) control study provided th e unique opportunity to superimpose, at minimal expense, a study examining the separate and interactive effects of deer browsing and alien invasive species on native herbaceous vegetation and tree regeneration. At the North Branford, Redding, and Storrs study areas, Drs. Williams and Ward erected deer exclosures in May 2007 on plots that were treated with the Fecon mower, plots treated with the Fecon mower with propane torch fo llow-up, and on plots where the barberry was not treated. Each of the three treatments had an adjacent unfenced plot. For each treatment (total of six), rege neration and herbaceous vege tation was sampled using ten 4- m 2 circular plots (sixty plots total/study area) in fall 2007, spring 2008, fall 2008, spring 2009, and spring 2010. Vegetation will be continually sampled over multiple growing seasons. This study will determine whether it is white-tailed deer, Japanese barberry, both, or neither limiting native species regeneration throughout Connecticut. 162 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Initial treatment Follow-up treatment Deer protection?

This in turn will negatively affect the future of the timber industry and native wildlife populations in Connect icut. By scientifically documenting the impacts that deer, barberry, and their interaction have on native forest regeneration, the timber industry, land managers, and other conservation entities will have sound data which with to both illustrate and immediately address these threats to the health of Connecticu t's forests for future generations. The Japanese Barberry Infestation Microclimate : In Spring 2008, two additional Japanese barberry management plots were established in Redding and North Branford, CT. Each plot was approximately 5 acres in si ze and Japanese barberry was controlled by Drs. Williams and Ward and J. P. Barsky using 400,000 btu propane torches. This control strategy differs from previous effort s in that dead Japanese barberry plants remained standing instead of being removed altogether. Based on previous results, Dr. Ward hypothesized that dense Japanese barbe rry infestations may retain humidity, resulting in increased abundances of blackle gged ticks, which require stable and humid conditions to survive. To investigate this hypothesis, temperature/relative humidity sensors were deployed from June-December 2008, 2009, and again in 2010 in areas where barberry was controlled, areas where barberry was not cont rolled, and areas where barberry was virtually absent. In addition, blacklegged ticks and white-footed mice have been continually sampled during sensor deployment in 2008, 2009, and presently in 2010. Sensor data analysis from 2008 and 2009 has revealed that unmanaged Japanese barberry infestations provide excellent habi tat for blacklegged tick survival because, due to their closed canopy-like growth form, th ey retain more of the humidity from the previous night throughout the following day th an do areas where barb erry was controlled or absent. In addition, the Japanese barber ry canopy buffers temperature and relative humidity swings throughout the day, providi ng a more stable microclimate than areas where barberry was controlled or absent. Because blacklegged ticks have a relatively high surface area to volume ratio, they are pron e to desiccation, and as a result, need a continually humid and stable microclimate to su rvive, which the exotic invasive Japanese barberry appears to provide. Sensors will be retrieved at the end of 2010 and ticks and mice will continue to be sampled. This research investigates the causal mechanism behind the increased abundances of blacklegged ticks found in Japanese barb erry infestations. By understanding this relationship, land managers can better target problem areas where Japanese The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 163 barberry is most prevalent, which will ulti mately lead to a reduction in the number of ticks capable of causing Lyme diseas e in humans and domesticated animals. Deer Browse Exclosure Study: One method to study the impact of deer on natural ecosystems is to compare growth rates and sp ecies diversity of ve getation protected from white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) browse to unprotected plots. Drs. Williams and Ward are collecting vegetation data within si xteen deer exclosures and sixteen adjacent control plots throughout the state. D eer exclosures prevent deer from accessing vegetation within. Growth ra tes and species diversity of enclosed vegetation are compared with that of an adjacent control plot, where deer have access to vegetation. The project is a collaborative effort with The Nature Conservancy to maintain and sample twelve deer exclosures (and adjacent contro l plots), at Burnham Br ook Preserve in East Haddam, the Bingham Easement in Salem, a nd Devil's Den Preserve in Weston. We are also including four of our own exclosures on South Centra l Connecticut Regional Water Authority property in North Branford. Plots have been sampled for herbaceous species cover in spring of 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Late summer sampling was conducted in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 and in cluded all woody and herbaceous plants. Preliminary data analyses indicate th at herbaceous cover within exclosures is greater than control plots. Dens ity of tree seedlings at least tw o feet tall is twice as high within exclosures compared to control plot s. All locations will be resampled for both woody and herbaceous vegetation in late su mmer 2010. Results from this study will reveal plant species composition and growth rates in the absence of browsing deer. Overabundant herds of white-tailed deer ne gatively affect forest regeneration by repeated browsing. This in turn will negat ively affect the fu ture of the timber industry and other wildlife populations in Connecticut. By scientifically documenting the impacts that deer have on native forest regeneration, the timber industry, land managers, and other conservation entities will have sound data which with to both illustrate and immediately address this threat to the health of Connecticut's forests for future gen erations. The Nature Conservancy in Connecticut uses these data to justif y and document results of their deer management program. Deer Vehicle Collisions in Connecticut : Annually, the Department of Environmental Protection receives approximately 3,000 reports of vehicle collisions with deer on Connecticut roadways. But because of poor re porting rates, the DEP estimates there are an estimated 18,000 that occur annually. Regardle ss of the exact number, it is evident that deer pose a significant threat to Connecticut motorists' health and personal property. There has been abundant research on differe nt strategies of reducing deer-vehicle collisions by altering either motorist or deer behavior, which has met with limited success. However, there is limited research on the behaviors of deer proximate to roadways and how deer integrate roads into their home ranges. In the interest of discovering deer behaviors that could be targeted in an atte mpt to reduce collisions with vehicles, Dr. Williams is initiating a new deer capt ure program in Fairfield County, which annually records the highest number of deer-vehicle collisions. Captured deer will be fitted with ear-tags and global positioning system collars, which record precise 164 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 locations of deer throughout the year. On ce data are obtained from GPS collars, an analysis of deer movements across different seasons, times of day, during different weather events, etc. can be conducted to be tter understand how, when, and where deer cross roads. Capture effort s will begin in fall 2010. State Farm Insurance estimates that the likelihood of a deer collision in Connecticut is 1 in 297. A better understanding of seasonal deer behaviors proximate to roadways will allow engineers and public transportation agencies to better target deer-vehicle collision abatem ent attempts which will then decrease the odds of motorists striking a deer and sustai ning injury or death while traveling on Connecticut roadways. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 165 GRANTS AND CONTRACTS OFFICE The Grants Office is in its third year. Tess Foley is the Grants and Contracts Manager. In this capacity, she assists Station scientists to identify, prepare, submit, and track grant submissions. Tess works to establish rela tionships with government, corporate, and private foundations on behalf of the Experiment Station. In the first eight months of 2010, Ms. Foley ha s assisted Station scie ntists in preparing and submitting 42 grant proposals to a variet y of government, corporate, and foundation funding sources. Thus far, from grant submi ssions, experiment station scientists have received $1,196,982 in competitive grant funding. Additionally, ongoing funding relationships are still in place with the Pr opane Education Research Council and Webster Bank. Competitive grant proposals are being submitted from all departments. In September, Tess Foley managed the first announcement letter campaign for the CAES Research Foundation, the Experiment St ation's non-profit 501c (3) organization. During this campaign, 400 letters were sent to Connecticut-based businesses informing them of the agricultural, envi ronmental, and public health re search of experiment station scientists. As public awareness increases, we are now beginning to receive contributions from corporate foundations and individuals. This year, several grant-funded projects came to life at the experiment station. The CAES Research Foundation received a gr ant from the New Haven Community Foundation for a \"Girls and Science Mentor ship Program.\" During the period of November 2009 to April 2010, Ms. Foley assisted the mentorship program's manager, Dr. Sharon Douglas, in the administration a nd management of hosting six middle school girls from New Haven's most disadvanta ged neighborhoods. There was a one-on-one mentorship with female Station scientists. At the end of the mentorship, Ms. Foley assisted the participating girls as they each presented their own project to their science class at each of their schools. Another grant-funded program, administered by the CAES Research Foundation, is with Webster Bank; the \"Food Donation Program \" contributes fresh fruit and vegetables, grown on the research farms, to hunger relie f organizations in Connecticut. The funding helps to cover the cost of seed and fertilizer . As the growing season draws to a close for 2010, our Food Donation Program has contri buted over 27,000 pounds of fresh produce to Connecticut's leading hunger relief organizations. Tess Foley is working to generate awareness and funding for the re search of the CAES food crop scientists, and hosted the CT Department of Agriculture's \"Farm to Chef\" program at the Experiment Station, where ea ch scientist presented their research on improving crop production for CT farmers. Tess Foley also promoted the CAES Resear ch Foundation to the Connecticut Tobacco Growers Association. 166 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 During the past year, Station scientists su ccessfully received grant funding from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Connecticut Department of Agriculture, USDA Forest Service, Ce nters for Disease Control and Prevention, USDA/Natural Resources Conservation Servi ce, Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES), Propane Education Research Council, Norcross Wildlife Foundation, First Light Power Resour ces, The Nature Conservancy, and the Conservation, Food, and Health Foundation. The CAES Research Foundation looks forw ard to continuing to develop strong relationships to advance the re search of Station scientists. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 167 DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY The Department of Plant Pathology and Ec ology conducts research to understand the biology and ecology of plant pathogens and their interactions w ith plants and the environment. Staff members also diagnose pl ant health problems for our stakeholders. Our mission is to manage plant health pr oblems using innovative methods that minimize impact on the environment, ensure a safe food supply, and maintain a healthy landscape for Connecticut. Scientists in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology are involved in both service and research activities. Our service e fforts focus on the diagnosis of plant health problems for all Connecticut residents, incl uding homeowners, plan t care professionals (e.g., arborists, landscapers, garden centers) , and commercial growers (e.g., greenhouse, vegetable, nursery, orchard, and vineyard crops ). We work closely with professionals and homeowners to develop disease manageme nt programs that require minimal use of pesticides and are compatible with the envi ronment. The Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology has an active outreach program , which offers fact sheets, disease management guides, web-based information, workshops, and presentations for grower groups, garden and horticultural clubs, special interest groups, and students. Our research efforts include original, basi c investigations in many area s of plant pathology, including the ecology and genetics of plant pathogens, new and emerging diseases, and models for predicting the spread of plan t pathogens. These studies focus on, but are not limited to, the needs of Connecticut stakeholders. In February 2010, Dr. Yonghao Li joined the department as the plant pathologist responsible for the Plant Disease Information Office . He has expert ise in cellular responses in host-pathogen in teractions, resistance mech anisms, and epidemiology of fungal, bacterial, and viral di seases. He also has experience in disease diagnostics and pathogen identification using traditional a nd molecular techniques, which will enhance the department's dia gnostic capabilities.

It is produced from the pyr olysis of plant and waste feedstocks at temperatures between 400 and 700 C. Biochar possesses tremendous absorptive capacities for organic compounds a nd certain nutrients. The a ddition of biochar to soil increases its retention of nutrients as well as its water-holding cap acity. Studies on the effects of biochar on crops have had variable outcomes, with some reporting positive effects and others reporting no or even delete rious effects on plants. Nonetheless, the ability of biocharabili ty of biochar to absorb allelochemicals in soil has generated much interest in its potential use in replant situations. Rotting asparagus crowns release allelopathic toxins, mostly phenols like coumar ic, caffeic, and ferulic acids. Asparagus is also susceptible to Fusarium crown and root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum and F. proliferatum . These two factors contribute to the asparagus decline problem and to the subsequent replant problem that occurs when old asparagus fields are replanted with asparagus. These toxins have been s hown to inhibit many other beneficial microorganisms, such as vesicular arbus cular mycorrhizae (VAM); the result is a reduction in plant vigor and an increase in susc eptibility to Fusarium crown and root rot. The effect of biochar on asparagus in soil was studied in greenhouse trials using soil naturally infested with Fusarium spp. and artificially supplemented with allelochemicals. Biochar (CQuest , Dynamotive Energy Systems Corp., McLean, VA) was applied at the rate of 0, 1.5, and 3.0% (w/w). The addition of biochar to Fusarium -infested asparagus soil that had been drenched with allelochem icals increased asparagus plant weights and suppressed disease, but the allelochemicals had no significant effects on either. The effect was linearly proportional to the bioc har rate. The allelochemicals significantly reduced colonization by VAM, but this effect was reversed when biochar was added. Rhizosphere densities of fl uorescent pseudomonads and the rhizosphere pH were also significantly increased at the higher rate of biochar (3%) when compared to the control, but densities of Fusarium spp. in the rhizosphere or in the bulked soil samples were not affected by biochar rate. An experimental field plot treated with biochar. Effect of biochar brands on disease Another series of experiments compared different types of biochar for their effect on asparagus growth. CQuest, Agrichar (Best Energies, Inc., Madison, WI), and Soil The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 169 Reef (EcoTechnologies Group, LLC, Berwyn, PA) were compared in asparagus soil augmented with dried asparagus root s and naturally infested with the Fusarium pathogens. Biochar was adde d at increasing rates and as paragus was planted in the amended soil. CQuest biochar was superior to Agrichar and to Soil Reef in increasing root weights and reducing disease. Root colonization by VAM increased sharply with CQuest and Agrichar. Soil Reef was not tested for its effect on VAM. These results are difficult to ex plain since analyses conducted by Dr. Joseph Pignatello have shown the CQuest biochar is the least absorp tive of all three biochars. In 2010, field plantings were establishe d to examine the effect of biochar combined with and without earthworms on aspa ragus. The effect of these treatments on VAM colonization, disease, and yield will be monitored over the next five years. Roots treated with some types of biochar resulted in increased colonization by vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) (left) and were more vigorous and more resistant to disease. Roots not colonized by VAM (right) had poor vigor and were more susceptible to disease. Impact: The development and production of bioc har may eventually serve to provide fuel, reduce atmospheric CO 2, and enhance crop health a nd production in contaminated soils. Ornamental Disease Research Fusarium corm rot of gladiolus Fusarium corm rot is a ubiquitous disease of gladiolus caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. gladioli . It is by far the most destructive gladiolus root disease. Ongoing research by Dr. Elmer found that a 20-min soak of corms in solutions of specific chemicals could provide season-long suppression of Fusarium corm rot. In 2009, we found that resistance to Fusarium corm ro t was proportional to th e rate of Actigard 50 WP. Combining Actigard with a nonpathogenic strain of Fusarium oxysporum (CS-20) did not provide additional benefit. Corms were dug, stored, and then planted in May 2010, in order to determine if any residual resistance to Fusarium corm rot can be detected. Impact : Many gladiolus growers in Connecticut a nd elsewhere have adopted the practice of pre-treating corms with a 20-min soak in the registered fungicide Terraguard 170 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 (triflumizol). In addition, Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. has included a specific corm soak on their 2010 fungicide label for Medalli on (fludioxonil) to allo w growers to begin using this product as a pre-treatment. Suppressing Pythium Root Rot with Par tial Soil Saturation in a Flooded Floor Greenhouse . Ebb & flow recycled watering systems ha ve been used with increasing frequency in Connecticut greenhouses over the past de cade. A major disadvantage of recycled watering is the potential for disease outbreak s and the development of fungicide-resistant pathogens. Although sub-irrigation is very efficient and allows water to be recaptured in reservoirs and re-used, conventional ebb & flow watering characteristically has long periods when root media are saturated with wa ter. As a consequence, it is difficult to control the amount of water taken up in each po t. In addition, a water-saturated medium promotes the development of root disease and allows the spread of motile Pythium spores in water that leaches from saturated pots. This water can also contain diluted fungicides that flow back into the reservoir tanks, pot entially promoting the emergence of fungicide- resistant strains of pathogens. A joint project involving Dr. Elmer, Dr. Martin Gent , Dr. Richard McAvoy (University of Connecticut), and Joe Geremia (Geremia Greenhouse, Yalesville, CT) resulted in the construction of a flooded floor greenhouse at Lockwood Farm. This greenhouse has two floors with different reservoirs that can be drained at different rates. The objective of the joint research project wa s to control the amount of water each pot receives with the goal of conserving water, li miting fertilizer use, and suppressing disease without any loss in crop value or in post-harvest quality. One floor had a \"W\" shape or slope and was flooded for 4 min (Partial Satu ration), while the other floor had a more typical \"V\" shape and was flooded for 16 min (S tandard). A series of experiments with poinsettias, geraniums, and chrysanthemums was conducted in the winter, spring, and fall, respectively, in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Within each crop, approximately 30 plants were inoculated with a Pythium pathogen and kept in a water-s aturated state to allow the disease to begin. The non-inoculated plan ts (>200) on each floor were monitored for symptoms of disease over the course of each experiment. At the end of the experiment, plants were removed from their pots and the root systems were rated for the percentage of diseased roots. Impact: Partial saturation offers great value to growers who use ebb & flow irrigation systems by reducing the amount of fertiliz ers and fungicides used on crops, and by producing more marketable plants with l onger shelf lives. Growers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Jersey are currently using ebb & flow i rrigation systems in commercial operations. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 171 Poinsettia with healthy, white roots. Poinsettia with brown, mushy roots infected with Pythium root inued to appear along Connecticut's Long Island Sound in 2009. New sites and expans ion of old sites were noted. Surveys and greenhouse experiments with Spartina alterniflora (SA) have not provided evidence to explain the source of SVD. A three-ye ar survey between CT and MA (Sea Grant) found the incidence of Fusarium spp. was consistently higher in SVD sites than in marshes where no SVD occurred. Dr. Elmer's collaborative work with Dr. Robert E. Marra found that pathogenic isolates of Fusarium were closely related, and have been described as a new species, Fusarium palustre (see Phylogenetics ). Additionally, in collaboration with A. LaMondia of CAES, a root-knot nematode (RKN) was found in SVD and interactions with F. palustre have been found to result in more damage than either pathogen alone. However, it could not be demonstrated that F. palustre combined with or without nematodes could cau se plant mortality, and may not be causal to SVD. Grazing pressure by the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum, may be affecting recovery from SVD. Although a causal relationship was never demonstrated between the crab and SVD, their presence in SVD sites is intri guing, and suggests the current working hypothesis that S. reticulatum may hinder recovery from SVD. Since many terrestrial arthropods (insects) are visually attracted to stressed plants, we questioned whether marine arthropods (crabs) are similarly attracted to stressed SA. In 2009, the presence of S. reticulatum and Uca spp. were monitored in pitfall traps in two classes of SVD site, those that were rec overing and those where no recovery has been observed for the past five years. Ou r 2009 findings found no differences between S. reticulatum in these sites, but more Uca spp. were observed in SVD sites that never recovered. This suggests that S. reticulatum density is not associat ed with recovery, but Uca spp. may be associated. A thorough understanding of how plant pathogens and herbivores interact might yield information that could improve recovery from SVD. 172 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum . Blue marsh crabs feeding on Spartina alterniflora transplants in captivity. (Photos by Peter Thiel) Phylogenetics of Fusarium Species Isolated from Spartina alterniflora and Associated with Sudden Vegetation Dieback (SVD) in Marshes. The majority of Fusarium isolates obtained by Dr. Elmer from Spartina alterniflora in SVD sites ranging from Georgia to Maine could not be assigned to known species of Fusarium , and therefore have been analyzed phylogenetically by Dr. Robert E. Marra . Pathogenicity tests c onducted by Dr. Elmer on S. alterniflora in greenhouse experiments resulted in these isolates being identified as either pathogens or nonpathogens. In order to determine the phylogenetic placement of th ese isolates, Dr. Marra sequenced three nuclear genes - -tubulin, calmodulin, and tran slation-elongation factor 1- - in 20 pathogenic and 18 nonpathogenic isolates re presenting the breadth of geographic distribution of the study sites. The analysis included nine outgroup species, four of which did not have sequences for these genes av ailable on Genbank; therefore, Dr. Marra obtained these sequences direc tly. Dr. Marra edited and al igned these sequences, then performed bootstrapped Maximum Parsim ony (using MEGA4 software) and Maximum Likelihood (using PhyML) analyses on the al igned sequence datasets for each gene individually as well as on the combined gene dataset. Finding no topological discordance between the individual gene tr ees and the combined gene trees demonstrates that the data are robust, and that it is reasona ble to conclude that the path ogenic isolates (MS1 in the figure below) represent a new previously undescribed Fusarium species that is likely closely related to F. langsethiae and F. sporotrichioides . Drs. Elmer and Marra have named this new species Fusarium palustre , in a manuscript accepted for publication in the journal Mycologia . The nonpathogenic isolates may be a single species or one or more closely related species, as a group closely related to F. incarnatum and F. equiseti .

Numbers below the branches indicate the relative support, expressed in percentages, for the clade. Both Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony analyses resulted in nearly identical groupings, with strong (>80%) bootstrap support at the nodes. Fusarium palustre is a newly named species, described in publication. Future Outlook: This research will provide insight into the critical factors associated with marsh grass recovery in SVD sites and lay the framework for understanding the relevant contribution of herbi vores and plant pathogens to an ecosystem-based approach for restoration and management. Internal Decay and Carbon Loss in Living Trees of Northern Hardwood Forests. Dr. Robert E. Marra has initiated research on the critical role that forests play in sequestering carbon in the form of woody biomass, through the acquisition of CO 2 during photosynthesis. This has been the focus of much scientific, and popul ar, attention in the past decade or so, as the buildup of CO 2 in the atmosphere becomes a threat of growing exigency. One component of the carbon balance equation that has received little attention to date is the role that decay fungi play, principally through the metabolism of cellulose and lignin, in counter acting carbon sequestration. Most of the attention paid to decay fungi has focused on the impact they have on the timber industry, and for good reason: one study conducted in British Colu mbia estimated that two to three million cubic meters of merchantable timber are lost to Armillaria species alone. Because decay fungi often liv e inside of, and continue to decompose, living trees for years and even decades, their role in car bon cycling is far from trivial, particularly given the interest at state a nd national levels to preserve and promote older-aged forests, which are dominated by canopy-dominant hardwood species. Recent analyses of carbon balance in old-growth forests ha ve shown that these forests co ntinue to act as global sinks for carbon, storing significant amounts of car bon in live and dead woody tissues as well as in the soil. As attention shifts toward s old-growth forests as major sinks of global carbon, decay fungi must be considered, as fungi become most prominent in older forests. Because of the difficulties in estimating the extent of decay in living trees, these data have been absent from carbon cycle models. Dr. Marra and Nicholas Brazee, Ph.D. candida te from University of Massachusetts at Amherst, have been experimenting with methods that allow for a nondestructive, but accurate, assessment of the extent of internal decay. The most promising technology involves the tomographic measurement of s ound waves and electrical currents as they travel through the tree. The measurements ar e taken at designated cross-sectional points, 174 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 with the possibility of taking multiple measurements at different heights along the main stem. To determine if sonic and electrical impedance tomography could effectively detect decay within living trees, 22 cross-s ectional measurements were captured from nine trees (four Acer three Betula lenta , and two Fagus grandifolia ) in two Connecticut forests. Sampling took place from April 11 - 14, 2010 at Sessions Woods Wildlife Management Area, Burlington, CT , and West Rock Ridge State Park, Hamden/New Haven, CT. With the assistance of Mr. Joseph P. Barsky, eight trees were felled and 19 stem disks cut for comparison with the tomographic results. Sonic and electrical impedance tomography were very ac curate in depicting the volume of decay present. For one black birch ( BB4) with extensive trunk rot rot), tomography accurately depi cted the area of cavities and area of decay (see figure below). Specifically, sonic tom ography estimated the area of cavity at 23% (actual area from cross-section = 22%), and electrical impedance tomography estimated the area of high conductivity due to funga l decay at 62% (actual area = 65%). Cross-section (left), sonic tomograph (SoT) (middle), and electrical impedance tomograph (EIT) (right) for black birch #4 (BB4) bottom section. Numbers on stem disc correspond to sensor numbers on SoT. Within the SoT, blue and purple areas are damaged wood, wh ile within the EIT the blue area has a relatively higher electrical conductivity, illustrating a buildup of moisture due to decay from the trunk rot fungus Inonotus obliquus . As forests become better recognized for their important role in mitigating against the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmos phere through its sequestration into woody biomass, scientists have focused on m odeling carbon sequestration rates, and in evaluating the differences in rates among different ages and types of forests. One component of carbon cycling in forests that has r eceived little attention thus far is the role played by decay fungi that inha bit living trees, particularly older trees, where the impact on carbon sequestration rates can be significant. As scientists strive to more accurately understand the dynamics of carbon cycling in fo rests, a more accurate assessment of the extent of internal decay in living trees is essential. To this end, the work described here is an important first step towards achievi ng this goal, and was used as essential preliminary data for a large grant proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation. Impact: The Conservation Arboriculture workshop, which focused on sonic and electrical impedance tomography, increased the awareness of arborists, tree wardens, and others in the tree care industr y about these cutting-edge techniques for detection of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 175 internal decay in trees. Attendees participat ed in real-time demonstrations of these techniques, which are widely used in Europe, and have new options to save and sustain veteran and legacy trees in the landscape. Bacterial Spot of Stone Fruits Dr. Marra has assumed responsibility for a Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) project on bact erial spot of stone fruits. This project focuses on the development of a biological control method against B acterial Spot, caused by the bacterium, Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni (Xap), one of the prominent stone-fruit diseases of southern New England, particularly of peach and nectarine. The strategy to be tested is whether we can use a bacteriophage, a natural vi ral enemy of the pathogen, to protect plants from infection and reduce the seve rity of the disease. We used a collection of 23 Xap strains and 43 phage strains, is olated from 19 orchards in Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts in the previous y ear. In order to determine the amount of genetic variability in both b acterial and bacteriophage collections, all 23 bacterial strains were infected with all 43 phage strains, to show that there was no difference in susceptibility among the bacterial strains, a nd no difference in virulence among the phage strains. To further test this, three bacterial st rains were infected with ten viral strains, and from the resulting plaques (containing lysed bacterial cells), lysogenic strains were isolated. A lysogenic bacterial culture is one that has not been k illed by the phage, but that rather has incorporated the phage DNA into its chromosome; thus transformed, the bacterial culture is now no longer susceptibl e to further infection by that same phage strain, but can still be infected by other phage strains if they are genetically different from the original infecting strain. Each of the 30 putatively lysogenic strains was then tested for susceptibility to all 43 phage strains, and the experiment repeated. Non-lysogenic (lytic) strains were used as positive controls. Because each lysogenic strain was resistant to all 43 phage strains, we concluded th at all 43 phage strains were functionally equivalent. This absence of phage diversity may pose problems for long-term sustainability as a biocontrol, as the bacterium can become resistant fairly rapidly. Sixty peach trees were planted in pots in the greenhouse, for use as host material in greenhouse trials. These peach tr ees are a variety, O'Henry, th at is highly susceptible to Xap. Numerous efforts to infect trees in the greenhouse were unsuccessful, due to the inability to sustain suitable conditions of temperature and humidity. The peach trees have been moved to the Lockwood Farm for the summer, and we will attempt inoculation there, as well. Three orchards of 49 trees each were plan ted at the three research farms, Lockwood, Windsor, and Griswold. The vari ety, Sweet Dream, is consid ered desirable in southern New England, but is too suscepti ble to Xap to be economically feasible. The trees will be allowed to grow for two years before field experiments are conducted on them to compare the use of phage to other disease control measures. Bacterial Spot continues to be a major problem for peach growers in Connecticut and current control options are limited and expensive. A naturally occurring bacteriophage would qualify as organic diseas e control, making it a very desirable option for orchardists. Neonectria Canker Caused by Neonectria ditissima ( prev. N. galligena) 176 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Dr. Robert Marra 's research on Perennial Cank er (also known as Neonectria canker) focuses on the ecology and genetics of the fungal pathogen, Neonectria ditissima, with the goal of gaining a fuller understanding of the life history, evolution, and population dynamics of the organism and its inte ractions with its hosts, particularly black birch ( Betula lenta ). Fundamental knowledge of the natural history of N. ditissima is lacking, yet is an essential prerequisite to th e development of an e ffective control strategy for Perennial Canker. Field techniques and la boratory tools necessary to the study of this fungus and the disease it causes have been de veloped and are being used to elucidate mating structure and the ecology of spore disp ersal. DNA from cultures obtained from infected bark and wood from various parts of Connecticut and the eastern United States are being analyzed using genetic markers in order to determine (1) if fruiting bodies are the result of outcrossing or se lf-fertilization, and (2) if out crossed, the extent to which they are inbred or outbred. Understanding this aspect of the mating system will shed light on the fungus' dispersal patterns, a critical precedent to the development of a biocontrol program. This research utilizes a set of 15 microsat ellite markers that were shown in earlier work to be highly polymorphic within and among sites in Connecticut and Massachusetts. The microsatellite markers are now being used to study two research sites in West Rock Ridge State Park. Micr osatellites are chains of repeating DNA motifs (e.g., acgacgacgacgacg) found throughout the geno mes of most eukaryotes; variation in the number of motif repeats at a microsatel lite locus underlies the length differences among alleles. Due to its increasing abundance in Connecticut, black birch is a tree of growing importance and concern. Although trees infected with Perennial Canker can persist for decades, the extensive scarring caused by the cankers renders them of little value for lumber or veneer. Our efforts to more fully understand the biology a nd natural history of N. ditissima will contribute to the identification a nd utilization of control strategies. Ramorum Blight/Phytophthora ramorum Dr. Marra has been working with Dr. Douglas in supervising the implementation of USDA-mandated assays for detection of P. ramorum on nursery material shipped from California, Ore gon, and Washington. Nursery surveys are conducted in cooperation with Dr. Victoria Smith and state inspectors. The process begins with a serological test called ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), which detects all Phytophthora species. The ELISA assays are performed by summer research assistants under the supervision of Dr. Balogh. If a sample tests positive by ELISA, Dr. Marra extracts DNA from the plant samples and then analyzes for P. ramorum -specific nucleotide sequences us ing real-time PCR assays. The Molecular Plant Diagnostics Labora tory was given Provisional Approval Status for P. ramorum by APHIS-PPQ and in December of 2009, Dr. Marra was certified in the 2010 Proficiency Testing Progra m for two real-time PCR assays. Impact : P. ramorum is a pathogen of growing concern in Connecticut because of the numerous species of plants and trees common in Connecticut that are known or suspected hosts. Much of this concern centers on C onnecticut's significant nursery industry, w hich at over $1 billion in annual production, ranks Connecticut am ong the ten largest in the country. Nurseries found to have plants infected with P. ramorum are effectively The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 177 quarantined to prevent potentia l spread of the pathogen until rigorously demonstrated to be clear of the pathogen, a pr ocess that can take several months. Therefore, Ramorum Blight, independent of its impact on our fo rests and landscapes, can have a significant impact on the state's economy. Many of th e most susceptible hosts\u2014eastern red oak, northern white oak, rhododendron, lilac, mount ain laurel, and viburnum, to name a few\u2014 are significant parts of the nur sery industry as well as Connec ticut forests and landscapes. Given that the eastern United States, including Connecticut, is consider ed at high risk for P. ramorum , based on host distribution and climate, concern over the possible release of the pathogen into the environment is warranted. Through the Molecular Plant Diagnostics Laboratory, Dr. Marra's goal is to accelerate and refi ne our ability to identify P. ramorum in infected plants from the nurser y, garden center, forest, and landscape, greatly increasing our chances of averting a Ramorum Blight epidemic. Additionally, the molecular diagnostic techniques being used and under development in the MPDL will continue to enhance the disease diagnos tics services provided to Connecticut's stakeholders. Integrated Pest Management for Winegrapes in New England Weather Monitoring Dr. Francis J. Ferrandino is continuing his work on diseases of winegrapes. This involves both an extension and a research component and is being accomplished through a collaboration of scientists and t echnicians at CAES, UMASS, UCONN, and URI. Between Decembe r 2008 and April 2009, seven cell phone-based remote access weather stations have been deployed in vineyards throughout s outhern New England (Hamden, CT; Windsor, CT; Newport, RI; and Deerfield, MA). These weather sta tions measure temperature, relative humidity, sunlight, wind speed and direction, rainfall, leaf wetness, and soil temperature every 15 minutes. The data are sent back to a central location once per hour, where they are accessible via the Internet. The resultant da ta are used to calculate disease risk assessment reports, which are made available to growers via Internet postings and direct email alerts. On-site weather station data ar e used to calculate disease risk assessments, which are delivered to the winegrape growers on a weekly basis. Dr. Ferrandino checking sensor connections for a weather station deployed within a Chardonnay vineyard located in New Preston, CT. In addition to collecting weather data, Dr. Ferrandi no and collaborators are keeping track of maturation dates for vari ous grape cultivars (Chardonnay, Vanessa) over 178 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Newport RI Powdery Mildew - Grape From 2010-07-01 To 2010-07-14 Temperature Hours Wet Ascospore Conidial Date High Mean 70-85 >95 Hours Infection Index 07/01 76.9 70.2 9.3 0.0 0.0 07/02 80.9 66.7 8.8 0.0 0.0 07/03 82.8 70.4 12.8 0.0 5.5 60 Heavy 07/04 94.7 77.9 5.0 0.0 0.0 50 Medium 07/05 3.8 0.8 0.0 40 Medium 07/06 14.8 5.0 0.0 50 Medium 07/07 87.2 77.9 17.5 0.0 6.3 70 Heavy 07/08 81.0 74.4 19.5 0.0 9.0 90 Heavy 07/09 83.0 22.3 0.0 11.8 100 Heavy 07/10 24.0 0.0 7.8 100 Heavy 07/11 91.9 0.0 5.5 Heavy 100 Heavy 0.0 9.0 100 13.8 100 Heavy 07/14 75.7 74.9 10.3 0.0 10.8 Heavy 100 Heavy the study area, as well as the date of diseas e onset and epidemiological development of the various grape diseases. Sample of a disease-risk report to assist vineyardists in making decisions about whether or not to spray. Pathogen Detection Dr. Ferrandino is continuing to use air samplers in infected vineyards to catch the spores that spread disease, particularly the fungus that cause s powdery mildew of grapevines, Erysiphe necator. The collectors on these air samplers are microscopically examined to estimate the concentration of ai rborne spores. Because he has encountered difficulties with identifying spores by dire ct, microscopic examination, molecular techniques (PCR) have recently been employed to confirm the presence of E. necator. Ms. Sletten has assisted with this new method, wh ich uses small plastic rods that are greased and placed in rotorod samplers. Th ese samplers are deployed in vineyards and spin the greased plastic rods very rapidly, so that airborne spores are trapped on the greased surfaces. DNA from spores collected on the rods is extracted and tested for the presence of grape powdery mildew using P CR and electrophoresis. This technique is specific for grape powdery mildew, which pr oduces a distinct mol ecular band. The PCR method is also more sensitive than microscopi c examination: positive results are achieved with as little as 10 conidia on a rotorod. Rotorod unit deployed in vineyard to catch powdery mildew spores. DNA extracted from spores of the powdery mildew fungus is amplified using PCR and produces a distinct molecular band (red arrow) after electrophoresis. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 179 Dr. Ferrandino and collaborators have establishe d three research vineyards at Hamden, CT; Windsor, CT; and at Griswold, CT. Crop growth and disease development are monitored in these vineyards for five winegrape cultivars: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc, Chambourcin, and Vidal. These vineyards are not sprayed in order to evaluate disease pressure. This season, due to the hot, humid weathe r, grape anthracnose (caused by Elsinoe ampilona ) became very damaging to certain cultivars. Impact: Web postings and Email alerts reporting first instance of disease in unsprayed experimental vineyards alerted growers to th e danger in their own vineyards. In 2010, powdery mildew of grape was observed on 4 June in Hamden CT and 10 June in Windsor CT, when grape flowers were in the early stages of setting fruit and most susceptible to this disease. In addition, a serious outbreak of anthracnose on grape (cv Vidal Blanc) was observed on 25 June in the Windsor pl ot and this information, as well as documenting photographs, were immediately Emailed to growers and posted on the CAES website within a few days. Three grow ers reported that they immediately scouted their vineyards, found the diseas e, and took corrective action. Environmentally-Friendly Control of Po wdery Mildew on Landscape Plants Dr. Ferrandino is continuing his work on environmentally-friendly controls of powdery mildew on common home to conventional chemical controls include sprays of cow' s milk, compost tea, horticultural oil, and potassium bicarbonate products. The results from 2008 and 2009 suggest that stylet oil (horticultural oil) offered the best protection for lilac--it delayed the time when 50% of the lilac leaves were infested by three weeks. This season, powdery mildew had been observed on monarda, phlox, and lilac by 8 July 2010, however disease levels were too low to evaluate the efficacy of the various sprays. Impact: Use of efficacious, environmentally-fri endly foliar sprays to control powdery mildew will reduce the chemical load on the en vironment. This is especially valuable around the home and many Connect icut residents have starte d to use these types of products in home gardens and landscap es as a result of our research. Mathematical Models of Plant Disease Epidemics Dr. Ferrandino is continuing his theoretical investigations on the relation between the form of mathematical models describing plant diseas e development in time and plant disease spread in space. This wo rk involves detailed i nvestigations of the connections between sporulation progress curv es and the temporal development of the resultant plant disease epidemic, as well as how the shape of the inoculum dispersal distribution affects the resultant spatial distri bution of plant disease. The confirmation of theoretical models depends on de tailed temporal and spatial sampling of plant disease. Dr. Ferrandino is continuing his spatio-tempor al assays of grapevine powdery mildew and other pathogens in vineyards, powdery mildew in ornamental and vegetable crops, and spread of foliar blights in tomato planti ngs. Mathematical models of plant disease with parameters, which are directly determined using field data, are essential in 180 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 evaluating the efficacy and economic and envi ronmental sustainability of IPM programs. Chestnut Breeding for Orchard and Timber Trees Dr. Sandra L. Anagnostakis is working with an American X Japanese tree [F1] in the New Hybrids at Lockwood Farm, which is now 17 years old, shows good resistance to chestnut blight and has good tim ber form. This tree was crossed with a CT American tree in the spring of 2010. Progeny of this kind of cross are known to segregate for resistance to ink disease ( The Japanese and the American parent trees of this hybrid are still alive and available for study (a t the Chestnut Plantation at Sleeping Giant and at Lockwood Farm). Tissues of this hybrid and of the parent trees of this hybrid have been sent to J. Romero-Severson at Notr e Dame University for DNA typing. Seed will be harvested in September, stored/vernali zed, and planted at Fo rest-Keeling Nursery (MO) in January for further studies. A ll of the seedlings will be genotyped by Dr. Romero-Severson, and will then be divided fo r planting between Griswold (for blight resistance and timber/orchard form evalua tion), Tennessee (Univers ity of Tennessee at Knoxville, for ink disease screening), and Missouri (University of Missouri at Columbia, for neutral site survival testing). A total of 556 chestnuts were harvested fr om hand-pollinated crosses in the fall of 2009, and 527 open-pollinated nuts were collect ed. These include orchard and timber selections for planting at CAES and by collaborators. Open-pollinated seeds were collected from Castanea henryi (Chinese chinquapin) and some of its hybrids at The Chestnut Plantation at Sleeping Giant in the fall of 2009 for continuing studies of resistance to Asian Chestnut Gall Wasp, in collaboration with Stacy Clark, USDA/FS, and private orchard owners in Ohio where th e wasp is now a serious threat to the nut crop. Seedlings from hand pollinations between individual Ozark chinquapin trees at Lockwood Farm are being raised in the gr eenhouse for planting at Lockwood Farm in 2012 and testing for resistance to chestnut blight. A cooperative project with the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma will allow plan ting of some of these trees on Cherokee land to determine survival potential. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 181 Dr. Anagnostakis and Ms. Pamela Sletten bag chestnut flowers for hand pollination from a bucket truck. Selected chestnut cultivars were graf ted in the greenhouse in the spring of 2010, and were planted at Lockwood Farm to increase our cultivar collecti on. More grafts will be made in late September to compare grafting success with thos e done in the spring. Maintenance of timber chestnut selections at Windsor and Griswold continues, and collections of seed in Windsor will be sent to Forest Keeling Nursery (MO) to produce seedlings for the Fairfield Garden Club's 2012 Centennial Project of planting 100 back-crossed timber chestnut trees on publ ic land in Fairfield County. Future seedlings from Windsor and Griswold will be used for planting in areas in Connecticut and other northeastern forests where timber harvests have released native chestnut sprouts. Butternut Canker Research Trees butternuts ( Juglans cinerea ) have been examined by Dr. Anagnostakis over the past few years in a search for butternut canker disease caused by Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum . To date, 180 trees have been examined and only one true butternut ha s been found. We have sent tissue samples of 176 Connecticut Juglans species to a colleague at Notre Dame University in Indiana for species confirmation using DNA markers. The butternut canker fungus was found twice on hybrids of butternut with Japanese walnut ( Juglans ailantifolia ). The fungus has been grown in the laboratory under various cu lture conditions, and compared to isolates from other parts of the U.S. One of our Connecticut isolates contains a double stranded RNA virus, and we will be testing the relative virulence of our two strains to see whether the virus reduces the virulence of the fungus. If this is th e case, a biological control system such as that used for the chestnut b light disease might be possible. At Lockwood Farm, we have planted 150 seedling butternut s, Japanese walnuts, and hybrids for our tests of virulence, and one inoculation done last winter showed little difference between the trees in their resistance. A test this winter will involve use of the two Connecticut strains (one with a virus and one virus-free) to see if they behave differently in these small trees. 182 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Pamela Sletten inoculates a small Juglans tree with the butternut canker fungus at Lockwood Farm. Results on the relative virulence of the C onnecticut strains of the butternut canker pathogen has the potential to identify a new bi ological control system for this important pathogen of landscape and forest trees. Noteworthy Diseases Late Blight of Tomato and Potato Dr. Sharon M. Douglas reported an unusually early and widespread outbreak of late blight of tomato and potato that occurred throughout Connecticut and the Northeast in 2009. This outbreak affected tomatoes and potatoes in commercial fields, backyard gardens, greenhouses, and high tunnels. This devastating disease has historical significance for its association with the Irish potato famine of the 1840's, and it rapidly kills plants under favorable environmenta l conditions such as cool, cloudy, windy, wet weather\u2014conditions that charac terized May, June, and July 2009. Strain US-22 of the late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, was responsible for most of the losses in the Northeast in 2009. This outbreak was unprecedented for a number of reasons. It occurred unusually early in the growing season and was initiated by widespread distribution and sale of infected tomato transplants by \"big box\" and chain stores throughout Connecticut and the Northeast. Once the infected transpla nts were set in the ground, they were exposed to favorable weat her for disease development and spread--a recipe for a significant disease outbreak. Growers throughout Connecticut realized significant economic losses due to late blight infections. Late blight is caused by the oomycete or fungus-like organism Phytophthora infestans. This pathogen is appropriately name d and is derived from the Greek words \"phyto\" meaning plant, and \"phthora\" meaning destroyer, thus \"plant destroyer.\" There are several strains of P. infestans in the U.S., some of which are specialized on potatoes, some on tomatoes, and some are equally pathogenic on both hosts. The host range for P. infestans includes plants in the Solanaceae family, primarily tomato and potato, although infections of eggplant and pe pper have been reported. P. infestans has also been found to infect hairy nightshade (Solanum sarachioides) and bittersweet (S. dulcamara), as well as ornamental hybrid petunia. Because of the widespread outbreak of late blight this season, all tomato and potato plants should be considered at risk. The late blight pathogen can attack all aboveground parts of tomatoes and potatoes, as well as potato tubers. Sympto ms on stems and leaves of tomato and potato are very similar. They are readily visible to the naked eye and appear as water-soaked, olive-brown to black blotches or lesions on l eaves and stems. On tomato, similar lesions The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 183 can develop on the fruit. After rainfall or heavy dew, white growth of the pathogen is visible on infected tissues. General symptoms of collapse on tomato associated with late blight. Typical olive-brown late blight lesio ns on tomato leaflet. Infected fruit with white sporulation of the pathogen. Sporadic outbreaks occur from year to y ear in Connecticut. However, they are usually attributed to wind-blown spores of th e pathogen that are introduc ed into the state. Since these introductions occur late in the growing season, losses are usually limited. P. infestans does not survive in the soil or in plant debris. However, it can survive in infected potato tubers located in cull or compost piles. P. infestans is not seed- borne in tomato. As a consequence of the severity of the 2009 outbreak, there was widespread concern about the potential for high levels of overwintering inoculum and new outbreaks for 2010. Fortunately, only one confirmed case of late blight was diagnosed on tomato in Connecticut as of 30 June 2010. Undoubtedly, the different weather patterns of the 2010 season have had a significant impact on disease. New Web Site This year marked the debut of the Plant Disease Information Office Website created by Dr. Douglas. The objective was to develop a co mprehensive, state-of-the-art website to serve Connecticut residents and the agricultural community in two fundamental ways: provide timely, in-depth information on local plant health issues and provide guidelines for how to obtain accurate diagnosis of these problems. This website is still in development, but currently offe rs a location where information on management of plant health problems for all crops grown in the state is available. Growers and homeowners can also find presentations from meetings that are poste d as color PDFs that can be reviewed and printed, as well as alerts on diseases that are of concern to the state. We are currently developing a searchable da tabase by plant host (by common name or scientific name) or disease that will link to a gallery of high resolution images, short video clips, and plant health management information relating to hundreds of plant problems of concern for Connecticut crops. 184 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Home page of the new Plant Disease Information Office website: www.ct.gov/caes/pdio . Disease Survey Dr. Yonghao Li, Dr. Sharon Douglas, Department Scientists and Mary Inman diagnosed a wide range of plant health pr oblems for homeowners, commercial growers, plant care professionals, and government a nd cooperative extension personnel during the past year. Fungal, bacterial, and physiological disorder diseases were prevalent, although viral diseases were also identified on many hosts. Outbreaks of late blight on tomato and pot ato were associated with the cool and rainy conditions of summer 2009. The warmer and wet fall resulted in numerous winter injuries in woody ornamentals, fruit trees, and conifer species in the spring of 2010. Unusual warm and rainy weather in earl y spring provided favo rable conditions for infections by many types of pathogens, incl uding fungi, bacteria, and oomycetes (fungus- like organisms). Herbaceous and Woody Ornamentals: A wide range of diseases was identifi ed on perennials this season. Some herbaceous hosts and diseases were begonia, geranium, poinsettia, and chrysanthemum with bacterial leaf spot/blight ; chrysanthemum with white rust; iris with Heterosporium leaf spot and tomato spotted wilt vi rus (TSWV); mildew of impatiens The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 185 Broadleaf woody ornamentals and their di seases were ash with rust, powdery mildew and anthracnose; azalea with l eaf gall caused by Exobasidium; beech and ack spot and Dutch elm disease; crabapple with scab, rust, frogeye leaf spot, and fi re blight; cherry with black knot, powdery mildew, and fungal leaf spot; euonymus with ngea with spot and powdery with laurel with Cercospora leaf spot, Phomopsis stem canker, and Rhododendron ring spot virus; rhododendron with Phytophthora root rot, fungal leaf spot, leaf gall caused by and winter dieback; sedum and leucothoe with with fungal leaf spot and pow dery mildew; willow with scab and black canker; and witch hazel with fungal leaf spot. Leaf gall of rhododendron Bacterial leaf spot of poinsettia 186 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Conifer species and some of their diseases were arborvitae with Rhizoctonia root rot and Pestalotiopsis dieback; cryptomeria of juniper Swiss needlecast of Douglas fir Vegetables: Among common vegetable diseases diagnosed were bean with rust; basil with impatiens necrotic spot virus mildew , bacterial wilt, and anthracnose; pepper with Xanthomonas leaf spot and Phytophthora blight; pumpkin and squash with powdery mildew, Choanephora end rot, and downy mildew; late blight , Septoria leaf spot, early blight, bacterial leaf spot, bacterial wilt, gray leaf mold, cat-faci ng, blossom-end rot, and TOSPO viruses (TSWV and INSV). Fungal leaf spot of witch hazel The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 187 Septoria leaf spot of tomato. Bacterial spot of tomato. Tree and Small Fruit: Common tree and small fruit species and diseases were apple with black rot, frogeye spot, fire blight, rust , and Nectria canker; blueberry with rust and bacterial leaf spot; grape with black knot, powdery mildew and downy mildew ; nectarine with bacterial leaf spot, brown rot, and scab; peach with scab, X-disease, Fabraea leaf spot, and black knot; plum with brown rot and black knot. Turf: Common disease problems on residentia l lawns and golf courses were summer patch, red thread, yellow patch, Rhizoctonia brown patch, rust, and anthracnose. Weeds: Predominant weeds in turf and gardens were bentgrass, crabgrass, ground ivy, mugwort, nutsedge, st ar-of-Bethlehem, wild violets, and wild garlic. Identification and control of true, running bamboos and Japanese knotweed, plants that often become invasive, continued to be significant problems for many Connecticut landowners. Poison ivy remained a key plant of great public concer n. Increased public awareness of non-native invasive plants lead to many inquiries regarding Mile-a-minute vine, garlic mustard, and Oriental bittersweet for identification. Impact: Each year, information about the diseases that occur on plants in Connecticut is used by green industry profe ssionals, arborists, nursery a nd greenhouse owners, farmers, orchardists, and homeowners th roughout the state to help them manage, monitor, and assess diseases, as well as to predict potential disease problems for plants or future crops in the coming years. Members of the depart ment communicate this information in timely ways to state residents through workshops, presentations, twilight meetings, web postings, and fact sheets. This information also helps to detect and assess new diseases or to identify potentially important emerging diseases on specific plants, which can then be monitored in the years that follow. 188 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 SERVICE ACTIVITIES Members of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology are involved in a wide range of service and public outreach activ ities. Some of these services involve presentations, publications, displays at mee tings and other outreach events, tours of facilities, and interviews, in addition to be ing conducted in coopera tion with other state agencies. Seed Testing: In cooperation with th e Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Regulation and Inspection Every year, inspectors from the Bureau of Regulation and Inspection of the Connecticut Department of Agriculture collec t official samples of vegetable, crop, and lawn seeds for analysis. Samples are submitted to The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station since it is the official seed testing laboratory for Connecticut. The Department of Plant Pathology and Ecol ogy performs the germination and purity analyses that are required fo r compliance with the Connectic ut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act. In 2010, 320 vegetabl e, 8 lawn, and 10 crop seed samples were submitted to Dr. Douglas for testing. Ms. Inman tests all seeds following strict protocols designated by the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA). Seedlings are carefully examined, since they must appe ar \"normal\" (i.e., free from decay, have well-developed primary systems, have well-developed and inta ct hypocotyls and/or epicotyls, and have healthy cotyledons). Of the 8 lawn seed samples tested, three met label claims for both purity and germinati on. Four samples passed label claims for germination, but did not meet claims for purity. One sample failed both purity and germination. Another compone nt of the analysis is examination for prohibited noxious weed seeds. Of the 10 crop seed samples test ed, nine samples met label claims for purity and germination and one sample failed both purity and germination. Of the 320 vegetable seed samples tested, twenty-one fa iled label claims for germination. They were not retested because of insufficient amounts of seed. None of these samples contained weed contaminants in 2010. A Station Technical Bulletin will be written to report the findings of this year's results. Impact: Results of seed tests c onducted by Station staff are re ported to the Seed Control Official of the CT Department of Agriculture who has the authority to stop the sale of products that do not meet label claims or cont ain noxious weeds. In the short term, this program protects state residents from purchas ing inferior seed and ensures that seeds comply with the Connecticut Seed Law Regula tions and the Federal Seed Act. The long- term benefit of the seed testing program is to minimize the ina dvertent introduction of noxious weed seeds that could potentially im pact crops of economic importance and the state's ecosystem. Samples for Analytical Chemistry and th e Connecticut Depar tment of Consumer Protection During the year, Department Scientists, Dr. Li, and Ms. Inman examined 27 samples from the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection at the request of the Department of Analytical Chemistry of the Experiment Station. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 189 Samples for 2010 National Nursery Survey and Trace-Forward and Trace-Back Surveys for Phytophthora ramorum Connecticut participates in a national surv ey of nurseries to assess the presence of the Ramorum Blight (Sudden Oak Death) pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum , state. Connecticut also conducts trace-forward a nd trace-back surveys when requested by USDA-APHIS-PPQ. The objectiv e is to survey nurseries at risk of harboring or distributing P. ramorum- infected plants or when appropriate, homeowners who have received possibly infected plants. Drs. Douglas and Marra supervise the USDA- mandated assays for testing. During the past year, Dr. Victoria Smith (Deputy State Entomologist) supervised the collection of 251 samples by CAES nursery inspectors and PPQ personnel. Samples were then tested for P. ramorum . At the time of this publication, no samples tested positive for P. ramorum in any of the 2010 surveys. Samples for Chrysanthemum White Rust In the Fall of 2009, there was another outbreak of Chrysanthemum white rust (CWR) in Connecticut. Since this is a disease of regulatory concern, the outbreak resulted in a cooperative effort between the Experi ment Station and USDA-APHIS-PPQ. Dr. Douglas examined samples collected by CAES nursery inspectors and USDA-APHIS- PPQ personnel under th e supervision of Dr. Smith. Inspectors examined 50,000 plants at a grocery store as part of a trace-back activ ity, but no plants with CWR were found. An additional 20,000 plants were inspected for another grower and 8,500 were found to be infected. They were destroyed by burial on site. At a third lo cation, 93 symptomatic plants were identified and destroyed by di sposal in the municipal waste stream. Middlesex County joined Hartford, New Haven, Litchfield, and Fairfield Counties with confirmed positive CWR outbreaks that we re successfully eradicated. Many new cultivars were also found to be infected in 2009, such as 'Manakin Red,' 'Eureka Yellow,' and 'Hankie.' Impact: Chrysanthemums grown in several Conn ecticut locations that were inspected, tested, and confirmed to be in fected with Chrysanthemum wh ite rust. Since this is a regulated pathogen, infected plants were de stroyed as part of a cooperative regulatory effort. Citizen Inquiries Plant Disease Information Office Drs. Li and Douglas, assisted by Department Scientists and Ms. Inman, answered 5462 inquiries about plant health from Connec ticut citizens. Alt hough the majority of inquiries were on ornamentals, trees, and shr ubs (60%), other categ ories, such as food crops (23%) and turfgrasses (3%), were also well represented. The number of inquiries on food crops represents a 5% increase from the previous year, possibly due to recent increased interest in local pr oduction of food crops, in bac kyard and commercial gardens as well as the unusually severe ou tbreak of late blight of tomato and potato that occurred in 2009. A moderate percentage of inquiries fell into the miscellaneous category (14%), which included identification of plants and poison ivy control and identification. Although the m ajority of inquiries were fr om Connecticut homeowners (67%), the 190 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 number of the inquiries from commercial growers and pl ant care profe ssionals (27%) showed a marked increase. Inquiries from cooperative extension, health, news, and agricultural personnel (6 %) remained consistent with previous years. A further breakdown of inquiries showed that 44% of the samples came in by phone, 11% came in by mail, 4% came as email (Connecticut onl y), and 41% were brought in person. The number of physical samples handled by the PDIO (52%) continued to exceed the number of phone calls (44%)\u2014this was a trend that was observed for the past 3 years. Over 700 letters and numerous email messages with attached files of fact sheets were sent from the PDIO. Many citizens opted to download fact sh eets posted on the CAES website in lieu of letters since this gave them instant access to the information of concern. Most of the miscellaneous questions were concerned with identification, human toxicity, and control of poison ivy and other poisonous plants, iden tification of various plants and weeds, mushroom identification for health officials, and information about pesticides and their relationships to health an d environmental concerns. Additional inquiries Dr. Anagnostakis answered 663 questions, tested 11 samples, and made 8 site visits. Dr. Elmer made 9 site visits, answered 19 questions, and tested 13 samples. Dr. Ferrandino made 25 site visits, tested 5 samples, and answered 10 questions, and Dr. Marra made 1 site visit and tested 1 sample from stakeholders. Impact: During the period covered by this Report , over 6227 Connecticut residents had plant disease problems accurately diagnosed by members of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. In many cases, the pl ant health problems diagnosed did not require fungicides for control, contrary to the initial perception that fungicides would be required. Staff members worked to educate professionals and home owners to develop disease management programs that were compatible with the environment that incorporated cultural practices, sanitation, and genetic resistan ce prior to pesticide use. Accurate diagnosis of plant health problems , educated citizenry, and implementation of integrated disease management strategies reduce pesticides introduced into the environment and water of Connecticut. MEETINGS ORGANIZED BY THE DEPA RTMENT OF PL ANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY Meetings and Workshops Dr. Wade H. Elmer co-organized two Bedding Plant Me etings with Ms. Leanne Pundt and Dr. Richard McAvoy of the University of Connecticut. Topi cs covered included: Update on Managing Insects and Mites on Sp ring Crops, Update on Nutrition, Chemical Growth Regulators, and othe r Production Tips, Update on Emerging Diseases, Nutrition and New Fungicides for Spring Crops and Upda te on Pesticide Safety. One session was held at the Tolland Cooperative Extension Ce nter in Vernon, CT a nd the second session was held at the University of Connecticut, Torrington campus, in Torrington, CT. Out of a total of 57 evaluations returned, 70% of the pa rticipants found the meeting \"very useful\" while 30% found it \"u seful.\" (February 2010) The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 191 Dr. Francis J. Ferrandino sponsored an informational meeting about the Southern New England Grape Information Network (SNEGIN) at the Valley Lab. Station participants also included Drs. Nail and Lamondia and Ms. Sletten . Among the topics covered were progress in establishing a weather sta tion network and delivering timely disease warnings to growers, the contribution of la st season's weather to disease problems and delayed harvest, importance of fungicide re sistance related to th e last downy mildew outbreak and powdery mildew, new cultural methods and cultivars, and new techniques for disease-risk assessment using PCR. (April 2010) Dr. Robert E. Marra organized a workshop on \"Conserva tion Arboriculture,\" held at the CT-DEP Sessions Woods Wildlife Manageme nt Area. Presenters were Mr. Philip Van Wassenaer of Urban Forest Innovati ons, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada and Mr. Lothar Goecke of Argus Electronics, Germa ny. The all-day workshop also included an outdoor on-site demonstration of the Argus Electronics PiCUS \u00ae Sonic and Electrical Impedance Tomography. The workshop was co -hosted by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. (April 2010) Drs. Wade H. Elmer and Sharon M. Douglas co-organized with Ms. Leanne Pundt and Dr. Rich McAvoy of the University of Connecticut and the Connecticut Greenhouse Growers Association a \"Plant Diagnostic Wo rkshop\" in Jones Auditorium. This was a hands-on workshop with over 30 plant samples with different problems. After an initial round at diagnosing the problems on the samples, participants heard several presentations that would help them sharpen their diagnosti c skills. Topics included \"Diagnosing plant health problems: How to get started,\" \"H ow to identify & di agnose plant disease to identify & diagnose plant diso to identify & diagnose insect-related disorders,\" and \"Weed, algae & related problems.\" Out of a total of 48 evaluations returned, 84% of the participants found the meeting to be economically beneficial to their commercial operations. (June 2010) Lockwood Lectures Dr. Wade Elmer organized a Lockwood Lecture by Dr. Clive Edwards from Ohio State University. The title of the lecture was \"The Use of Aqueous Solutions from Vermicomposts in the Suppression of Plant Diseases of Tomatoes and Cucumbers.\" (March 2010) Drs. Sharon M. Douglas and Robert E. Marra co-organized a Lockwood Lecture by Dr. Kevin T. Smith, plant physiologist and forest pathol ogist with the US Forest Service, Durham, NH. The title of the lecture was \"Tree Survival and Response to Injury, Infection, and Environmental Change.\" (May 2010) Conference Organizing Dr. Robert E. Marra served on a Steering Committee for Connecticut Conference on Natural Resources from 2005 to present. The confer ence was held this year on Monday, 8 March 2010, at the University of Connectic ut, Storrs. The conference was attended by 192 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 243 people, including five sc ientists from CA ES who presented two talks and two posters. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 193 VALLEY LABORATORY The Valley Laboratory is a multidisciplinar y Department that conducts research on insects, diseases, soil nutrition, mycology, integrated pest management and weeds of concern to commercial agriculture and homeowners in Connecticut. The Valley Laboratory was originally established by the Board of Control in 1921 to conduct tobacco research. While research on shade and broadleaf tobacco continues today, the mission of the Department has greatly expanded to refl ect the diverse agriculture present in the State. In addition to researc h, Valley Laboratory scientists and staff diagnose insect and plant health problems, test soils for fertility and structural analys es, conduct outreach to growers and homeowners by speaking to professional and community groups, host informational meetings, and assist students. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Activities on the farm: There were a total of 59 experi mental plots during the past year at the Windsor farm. Seven Windsor-based scientists had 32 of these plots; six New Haven-based scientists and a Un iversity of Connecticut grad uate student were using 18 plots. The remaining plots were maintained by the Farm Manager as rotation crops or for seed collection. Valley Laboratory scientists also conducted experiments in many plots off site, such as in growers' fields and State forests. Farm Manager James Preste kept the farm and his equipment ready and in exce llent shape. He expertly maintained the many field plots and addressed the specific need s of each scientist. He and his summer assistants did an outstanding job maintain ing the extensive ornamental garden in cooperation with the Connecticut Nu rsery and Landscape Association. Mr. Preste and 194 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Dr. LaMondia coordinated the Valley Laboratory e ffort to comply with EPA Worker Protection Standards for Agricultural Pestic ides and organized and conducted training sessions for the staff. Biological Control of He mlock Woolly Adelgid Eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis, is an important native conifer climax species, which provides essential wildlife habitat and cover, especially in winter. Hemlocks also protect watersheds and maintain critical cool stream temperatures for native trout species. In the garden landscape, it is a popular tree and a common component in Connecticut's state parks and forests. Si nce 1985, eastern hemlocks in Connecticut have been under attack by the non-native heml ock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae, an accidental introduction from southern Japan. Biological control using imported predators of the adelgid is a major long-term national strate gy for reducing the impact and spread of HWA in our eastern forests. Projects 1-4 are funded by the USDA Forest Service. 1) Project: Biological Cont rol of Hemlock Woolly Ad elgid: Field assessments In Connecticut, research, release an d evaluations of a tiny ladybeetle, Sasajiscymnus tsugae, imported from southern Japan in 1994 to predate on HWA have been ongoing for 16 years, supported by the USDA Forest Service. Over 176,000 S. tsugae have been released in 26 Connect icut forests and parks since 1995. Dr. Carole Cheah continued a multi-year study collecting a nnual crown data on hemlock health and adelgid population trends from September to December 2009 from 16 established 8-14 year release sites throughout the state and 7 uninfested hemlock plots to evaluate long- term effects of biological control releases and potential for he mlock recovery in infested stands. From March-April 2010, Dr. Cheah also collected adelgid-infested foliage from 10 sites throughout the state and determined the average winter mortality of 1000 HWA per hemlock site. The data are used to generate information on the overall condition of the state's hemlocks, predict subsequent tre nds of HWA populations in different regions of the state and advise homeowners and forest managers on strategies for control of HWA. Results: The majority of hemlock stands where the beetle has been released and established continue to exhibit sustained crown rec overy with little or no tree mortality, dispensing with the potential costs of tree removal of hazard or dying trees and preserving the quality of recreational use for Connecticut's citizens. Hemlock health was maintained in 75% of bi ological control release stands where the mean foliage transparency was not significantly different from healthy baseline stands. Of the 11 sites which are associated waters hed areas, 82% maintained healthy crowns for watershed protection, which in clude 2 nationally de signated \"wild and scenic rivers\". The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 195 After a summer with consistently heavy rains in 2009 (99/115), only 25% of release sites (n = 4) had medium to heavy in festations of elongate hemlock scale, Fiorinia externa, while 37% of sites which had previous ly heavy infestations of scale now showed a decline in densities on new shoots. Annual assessments of winter mortality of adelgid in Connecticut since 2000 have been significantly correlated to minimum winter temperatures. The winter of 2010 was generally mild with minimum temper atures only dipping below 0 \u00baF in the extreme northwest hills and only briefly fo r a few hours in January. Overall, the winter of 2010 ranked as 78/115. Field visi ts showed that statewide, HWA was actually scarce. Winter mortality was ve ry low and averaged around 20% with more variability over all three climatic regions of Connecticut. The highest HWA winter mortality was experienced in the extrem e northwest where HWA mortality was 41- 51%. Mortality was negligible in urban and southern areas (< 10%). Impact: As a consequence, homeowners were advised to implement control measures on landscape trees especially in the southern ha lf of the state, al though HWA populations in natural stands remained low through most of the state. There has been no significant hemlock mortality from HWA infestations in the last decade since implementation of biological control in 1995. 2) Project: Development of ar tificial diets for predators of hemlock woolly adelgid Dr. Cheah continued to maintain an experimental S. tsugae colony with lines originating from the first shipments from Osaka, Japan in 1994 and 1995 and a more recent line from a different location, Kobe, Japan, obtained in 2006. Current laboratory studies, in collaboration with Dr . Allen Cohen of Insect Diet and Rearing Research, LLC, and supported by the USDA Forest Service, are ai med at the development of an artificial diet and/or supplement to augment and improve the mass-rearing of adelgid predators for implementation of biological control in infest ed forests. Currently, all mass rearing of predators requires healthy HWA-infested foliag e. Supplies of the latter are unpredictable and of variable quality and affected by dr ought, winter extremes and accessible collection areas. Artificial egg diets de veloped by Dr. Cohen have resu lted in equal or superior results to existing diets used for emer gency feeds for HWA predators such as S. tsugae , when abundant, high quality livi ng adelgids are not available. Modifications with various yeast cultures and supplements were made to the base diet with the goal of improving larval development and optimizing adult survival and reproduction. In 2009- 2010, research focused on developing modificat ions of the F100 egg diet and conducting preference side-by-side bioassays with S. tsugae and Laricobius for encap sulation of diets. Results: A total of 24 modified diets were tested in 2009-2010. New emergent S. tsugae showed a preference for a base diet modified with sweet whey. Both new and older reproductive adults did not show preferences for new diets modified with several new yeast cultures. Preference was shown for the unmodified base diet by both S. tsugae and L. nigrinus. Larvae of S. tsugae showed a distinct preferen ce and robust initial feeding response to one of the modifi ed diets, but the texture a nd presentation requires more 196 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 modification to allow for sustained feedi ng and survival. In 2010, survival of L. nigrinus was very high (81% and 100%; n = 70) for L. nigrinus feeding solely on a Cohen egg diet mixed with honey without access to HWA for 2 weeks, indicating the usefulness of this diet in times of HWA scarcity. IDRR has fo rmulated and provided the basic diets FDFE3 and F100 to several researchers. In all cases, the use of these diet s resulted in equal or superior results to existing diets used fo r emergency feeds for HWA predators when abundant, high quality living prey (HWA) are not available. Impact: A superior adult supplement supporting enha nced adult predator survival would be highly beneficial and cost effective to the labor-intensi ve mass-rearing production in insectaries which produce HWA biological control agents. 3) Evaluation of Herbivore Induced Plant Volatiles as Possible Attractants for Predators of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Plants under herbivore attack have been shown to produce volatiles that in turn attract natural enemies of the herbivores in question and many predator and parasitoid species respond to such volatiles. Many coccinellids exhibit positive olfactory responses to odors of their prey and/or host plant systems. S. tsugae is a highly dispersive species with excellent flight capabilities but this has obscured results fr om recovery sampling techniques which are mostly concentrated in the extreme lower canopy. Olfaction capabilities of S. tsugae have been questioned previously but did not investigate optimal environmental and physiological conditions for testing and validating insect responses to odor sources, such as preconditioning treatments of test subjects, re productive states of individual test insects, appropriate airflow rates, humidity, ambient temperature, light intensity and balance. In this project, Dr. Cheah investigates all these factors as the response or non-response of a predator or para sitoid may also be influenced by biotic factors such as the insect's age and physiol ogical state (eg. satiated or starved), level of foraging experience or abiotic factors such as light intensity, water stress etc. that may affect levels of volatiles produced by the plants. Results: A custom-designed 2-way air-flow olfact ometer was designed and constructed with chambers large enough to accommodate infested and uninfested seedlings, to enable testing of whole plants, novel ex tracts and mixtures of natural plant and host material. Light intensity levels and balance, ambient temperature and rates of airflow suitable for eliciting behavioral responses of S. tsugae and L. nigrinus have been established and optimized. Synthetic herbivore induced plant volatiles are also currently being tested for responses by reproductive and non-reproductive S. tsugae . In Y-tube olfactometer experiments, S. tsugae demonstrated significant odor perception of eastern hemlock (infested or not) seedlings ove r blanks. The responsiveness and detection of infested hemlock odors was also found to be influe nced by the reproductive state of the individual. Older, repro ductive females and males of S. tsugae were able to significantly discriminate between inf ested and non-in fested hemlock seedling odors. Reproductive females were also significantly attrac ted to methyl salicylate odors. L nigrinus adults showed no response to infested eastern heml ock seedling odors over blank controls but showed positive response to methyl salicyla te although more replication is required. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 197 Impact: Methyl salicylate-based attractants may be suitable for development in a monitoring system for HWA predators. 4) Quality and Process Control for production of HWA predators Scientists in several laboratories (university, state, federal, and private businesses) mass rear predators of HWA. Often these predator releases have failed to provide the expected levels of HWA control, and mort ality of predators produced has been high during the rearing process. It is not known if these failures are because of 1) inadequate numbers of predators being rel eased, 2) problems in release te chniques, or 3) the quality of the predators themselves 4) questionable quality of the adelgid prey used for rearing. The quality control system c onsists of several tiers of observation and decision-making: 1) behavioral, 2) biomass a nd linear measurements, 3) bioc hemical assessments, and 4) internal morphology This project led by Dr. Allen Cohen of ID RR, LLC will develop product quality control techni ques which will provide a basis for improvement of production and process control for HWA predators. Results: Some of the most important quality and process parameters discovered in year 1 are as follows: protein content of predators and diet, free-radical scavenging capacity in predators and diets, lipid content, storage carbohydrate cont ent, predator biomass, and predators' internal cond ition. A range of healthy weights for wild-caught L. nigrinus from Washington State has been establis hed, and also for healthy colony-reared S. tsugae . Investigations have been initiate d for the summer soil-pupation and dormancy period for L. nigrinus , which is the most vulnerable stage for high mortality and low emergent success. Impact: Important parameters which influence the production quality of predators have and continue to be defined. The objective is to integrate these parameters into a system, which will enable early detection of produc tion and quality problems to optimize the efficiency of predator production. 5) Project: Establishment of a HWA predator field insectary A field insectary at the Lockwood Farm was established by Dr. Cheah with plantings of HWA-tolerant species of western, mountain and north ern and southern Japanese hemlocks in May 2009 as a new method for eventually rearing S. tsugae acclimated to the northeast climate for biological control releas es. This project is funded by USDA-APHIS PPQ. Results: Three species grew well during the 2009 growing season and western, mountain and northern Japanese hemlocks produced the most lush new growth. However, winter survival of transplants was affected by wi nter desiccation in 2010. Northern Japanese hemlock, Tsuga diversifolia , proved the hardiest and adap ted to Connecticut climate and 198 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 was able to produce replacement new shoots after a late frost killed a lot of shoot buds in all species. Southern Japanese hemlock (smalle r original transplants) also survived the winter of 2010 but were less vigorous and produced fewer new shoots in the spring of 2010. Western hemlock suffered severe de foliation by March 2010 but was able to recover by putting out plentiful new shoots by June 2010. Mountain hemlocks were the least adapted, and were severe ly defoliated. Mountain heml ocks also had the highest winter mortality with little recovery. Artific ial infestation of transplants was delayed due to the conditions of the recovering seedlings. Impact: Northern Japanese hemlock would be a suitable landscape/garden alternative to the threatened native eastern hemloc k which is susceptible to HWA. Chemical control of HWA Dr. Richard Cowles has continued to follow the responses of hemlock woolly adelgid to previous years' applications of sy stemic insecticides. Th e reduction in adelgid populations relative to the untre ated checks, for trees treated in fall of 2007 and sampled in 2010 were: CoreTect product, 88 and 95% (low vs. high dosage); Merit soil injection, 99.4%; Safari trunk spray, 92%; and Safari so il injection 96%. These results are consistent with earlier experiments in demons trating that a single insecticide application provides multiple years of benefits and permits hemlock trees to regain vigor. Bark applications in the form of trunk sprays proved to be surprisingly effective. Trees treated in August of 2008 with a trunk spray of 0.6 g of dinotefuran (Safari) active ingredient per inch of trunk diameter stil l had a 99% population reduction relative to the untreated checks when sampled in 2010. Adelgids could not be detected on trees treated with trunk sprays of imidacloprid or clothianidin, wher eas adelgids were detected on trees treated with soil applications using same amount of product. The trunk spray method therefore is at least as effective as the standard shallow soil inje ction treatments, which should minimize soil contamination with these insecticides. Evidence of the effectiveness of these treatments may be observed in the ro w of hemlock trees along the side of the Griswold Research Farm on Sheldon Road. Impact : All southeastern states with eastern he mlocks have adopted Special Local Needs labels for use of CoreTect, a slow-release tablet formulation of imidacloprid, and a trunk spray applica tion method for Safari (dinotefuran). Dr. Cowles originated these approaches for protecting trees from hemlock woolly adelgids. The Greater Smoky National Park is adopting use of dinotefuran to preserve tens of thousands of hemlock trees from hemlock woolly adelgid. Choosing dinotefuran over imidacloprid appears nece ssary for maintaining the health of infested trees because warmer winters and drought stress has led to trees dying within 3 years of initial infestation. Application guidelines were developed by park staff in consultation with Dr. Cowles ; evidence from his work will lead to approximately twice as many trees bei ng preserved with the same amount of insecticide. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 199 The Delaware Water Gap National Park is using the minimum effective dosage treatment method to maximize the number of hemlocks they can preserve for the amount of funding available. Several arborists have ad opted the trunk spray method for managing hemlock woolly adelgid and elongate hemlock scales for hemlocks in Connecticut, especially on sites with large numbers of trees. This treatment method is easily applied, precise, effective, and minimizes the contamination of soil with insecticides. Chemical insect pest management : Annual bluegrass weevil (ABW) continues to be the most difficult insect pest to manage on golf course turf. Pyrethroid resistance resulting from about 13 years of intensive selection have led to serious problem s of cross resistance to other insecticides, due to enhanced metabolic detoxification. Dr. Cowles determined that Spinosad, a natural product insecticide, a ppears to be one of the most reliable products for targeting ABW larvae. A field dose-response experiment determined that the labeled application dosage of 52 fluid ounces per acre is necessary to obtain about 80% population reductions. Half of that dosage provides about 50% ABW mortality. Impact: Golf course superintendents have become less reliant on pyrethroid insecticides, and are increasingly using biorational in secticides spinosad or indoxacarb to target larvae resulting in better c ontrol with reduced pesticide use. IPM for Nurseries Dr. Hugh Smith has collaborated with greenhou se and nurseries growers and biological control specialists to develop biological control programs of key arthropod pests of the Connecticut ornamental plant industry. He is developing training curriculum in Spanish and has offered a series of hands-on training in pest and beneficial identification to Spanish speaking nursery workers. Twenty nursery managers and five educators have received training in biologica l control of greenhouse and nursery pests. Forty-five Hispanic workers have received training in Spanish on biological control of key greenhouse pests. He has assisted in th e establishment of a web-based IPM guide for arborists and provides training and IPM material in Spanish for Spanish speaking nursery workers. A series of updated fact sheets, including a monitoring fact sheet in Spanish, are now available on the Internet. Impact: Improved monitoring skills and accurate in secticide information enables nursery growers to reduce insecticide use. By providing IPM training to Spanish speaking nursery employees, these workers can also co ntribute to IPM programs and insecticide reduction. 200 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Strawberry sap beetle research Dr. Smith has begun screening softer insecticides as alternatives for pyrethroids for management of the strawberry sap beetle ( Stelidota geminata ). In addition, he is developing simple, inexpensive trapping methods so that growers can determine when the sap beetle is becoming established near stra wberry fields. Trapping studies continued this year. He concluded that yellow s ticky ribbon was not an effective tool for monitoring sap beetle migration into strawberry fields. Impact: Strawberries are an important component of Connecticut's agricultural economy. Improved monitoring and least toxic approach es will help strawberry growers reduce insecticide use. Mycology Research: Dr. DeWei Li conducts research on indoor molds of human health concern, fungal succession on building materials, and infiltra tion of mushroom spores from outdoors into residences. Airborne fungi: Dr. Li studied the effects of Christmas trees on airborne molds in residences during the Christmas season in 2008 and 2009. Resu lts to date indicate that firewood and fireplace use may be the major source for elevat ed airborne fungi in residences during the Christmas season, rather than Christmas trees. Impact : There has been recent negative publicity on the effects of Christmas trees on airborne molds and indoor air quality. Future research should focus on not only Christmas trees, but also, fireplace use and ot her human activities to determine the real source for elevated airborne spore con centrations during the Christmas season. Fungal taxonomy and systematics: Dr. Li arranged the loan of 15 fungal type specimens including the type specimen for the genus Stachybotrys from Kew Botanical Garden, the National Museum of the Czech Republic, the University of Wisconsin, th e University of Illinois, and the Padova Botanical Garden in Italy. Dr. Li annotated the specimens ba sed on the latest taxonomic information and determined that five curre ntly accepted species are actually the same species (synonyms) and that two sp ecies were given invalid names. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 201 Impact : Clarifying some controversies in five species of Stachybotrys will help researchers and health professionals attempting to put a correct name on a Stachybotrys in the future and assist with research. New fungal taxa : Dr. Li collected fungal specimens throughout the year from both indoor and outdoor environmentalists. Three species new to science described. One of them was collected during Plant Science Day in 2009 at Lockwood Farm. Impact : Describing these new species is significant to the knowledge of fungal biodiversity and biosystematics. The role of each of these new species in their ecosystem and environments remain to be studied. C onsidering that Lockwood Farm is the place where Spadicoides subsphaerica was discovered and this site seems to be an unlikely place to find a new species due to its heavy human activities, it is easier to understand why so many fungi remain unknown to science. Red Bark Syndrome Study: Drs. Cheah and Li are conducting a preliminary study on the cause and distribution of red bark syndrome in hemlock. More and more people have noted that the bark of some trees in the Northeast has turned to red or orange in color. Red bark syndrome has become a rather significant ph enomenon in the last three years and has rapidly spread to most of the states in New England. The causal agent, a green alga, has been identified as a Trentepohlia sp. that is not among the th ree species which have been previously recorded in CT. They conducted a survey that has found it distributed in most areas of Connecticut. At present, it is hypothesized that global warming could be associated with increased distribution for the alga. Hemlock trees with red bark syndrome. 202 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Impact: The ecological and economic impacts of this phenomenon to our ecosystem and forest are unknown. It is very important to study why, where, and how it happens. Blight of Common Bean Caused by Phytophthora capsici: Phytophthora blight, caused by Phytophthora capsici, was first identified on pepper and is widespread in distribution inf ecting solanaceous and cucurbitaceous crops. It was first documented infecting a member of the bean genus Phaseolus ( P. lunatus) in Delaware in 2002, snap beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) in the field in Michigan in 2003 and later on Long Island, NY in 2008. In 2009, Drs. James LaMondia and Li observed snap and wax beans in commercial producti on with water-soaked lesions on foliage, stems and pods. Thirty to forty acres were a ffected in the flood plain of the Connecticut River in central Connecticut. Weather conditio ns had been warm and very wet. Lesions displayed white mycelia and sporangia and P. capsici was isolated from surface sterilized tissue. Pathogenicity was confirmed agai nst bean (cv. Valentino) and pepper (cv. Cayenne). Symptoms similar to those obser ved in the field on both bean and pepper developed on inoculated plan ts and the pathogen was re-i solated. Controls did not develop disease. The morphological characteristics of the P. capsici isolates were measured and used to confirm the pathogen's identity. To confirm the identity of our isolate genetically, Dr. C. Vossbrinck extracted DNA from one P. capsici isolate and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified and sequenced. The ITS sequence was identical to sequences of P. capsisci in GenBank and confirmed our identification of this new isolate as P. capsici . To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. capsici infecting Phaseolus vulgaris in Connecticut and New England. To help prevent serious losses in 2010, Dr. LaMondia worked with the CT DEP to obtain a Section 18 registration for Revus fungicide for control of Phytophthora blight in snap beans in Connecticut. Additiona l research is underway to identify bean varieties tolerant or resistant to infection by the pathogen. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 203 Snap beans with Phytophthora blight, caused by Phytophthora capsici . Impacts: The timely identification of a new pathoge n in Connecticut and the initiation of research on management of the disease may protect farm sustainability by adding integrated pest management tools consisting of appropriate fungicide s and host resistance or tolerance. Tobacco disease research: The Connecticut Agricultural Experi ment Station Valley Laboratory was established in 1921 (as the Tobacco Substa tion), to combat tobacco problems and diseases such as wildfire, a devastating disease caused by a bacterial plant pathogen. Wildfire was eventually eliminated by the development of plant resistance, and ever since, tobacco breeding to in corporate genetic plant resistance to plant pathogens has been ongoing. Plant resistance to majo r pathogens is the most economical, environmentally responsible, and often most e ffective way to control plant diseases. The development of plant resistance to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) in the 1950's, to ozone damage (weather fleck) in the 1960's, black shank in the 1970's, and Fusarium wilt in the 1980's and early 1990's effectively controlled se rious diseases which each threatened to seriously impact or even wipe out cigar wr apper tobacco production in the Connecticut River Valley. There are currently a number of pa thogens that threaten the crop. Dr. LaMondia conducts a breeding program to develop resistance to the tobacco pathogens: Fusarium mosaic virus, and Peronospora tabacina (blue mold) for both shade and 204 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 broadleaf types. The tobacco cyst nematode was first discovered in Hazardville, CT in 1951 and has since spread throughout the Valley. It can cause significant losses in shade and broadleaf cigar wrapper tobaccos in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Chemical controls use toxic and expensiv e fumigants and nematicides, so Dr. LaMondia initiated a research project with the goal of breeding for TCN resistance as a high priority in 1987. In addition, all broadleaf tobacco lines need to be resistant to Fusarium wilt as that disease is widespread and readily kills sus ceptible plants. Fusarium wilt increased in severity during the 1980's and early 1990's, causing up to 20% crop losses on broadleaf tobacco. The development and release of wilt-resistant broadleaf cultivars has avoided at least $5 million per year in lo sses due to this disease each year since 1992. Production of CAES wilt-resistant cultivars has reduced the spread of the pathogen and kept infested fields in production without soil fumigation. All advanced shade and broadleaf lines under development continue to be screened in the field for hi gh levels of wilt resistance. Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) is also a common pathogen that can persist in soils for years and can cause economic losses. From 2002 to 2007, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection resulted in significant commercial lo sses ($3 to $5 million) due to green spot development on TMV-susceptible shade and broadleaf tobacco. Dr. LaMondia's research demonstrated the asso ciation of green spot with TMV, and determined that plant resistance was the single most important factor for reducing green spot. All new shade and broadleaf lines being produced are selected for resistance to TMV. Resistance to TMV is determined by a single dominant gene and resistance to Fusarium wilt is the result of accumulating a number of smaller-e ffect genes. Resistance to both pathogens can be transferred from adapted broadleaf tobacco and can be easily selected for. Resistance to the TCN is also a single domin ant gene (determined as a result of CAES research) but the source of resistance was a wild tobacco type. Resistance was transferred to flue-cured tobacco resulting in poorly adapted and very different tobacco from our cigar wrapper types. Many gene rations, hard selection and some luck was required to transfer nematode resistance to broadleaf wit hout the deleterious traits associated with it. Initial crosses for cyst nematode resist ance were made in 1987 between two flue- cured tobacco lines that were obtained from cooperators in Virginia. The lines were VA- 81 and PD-4 (which each carried resistance to the Tobacco cyst nematode but were unmarketable as cigar wrapper tobacco, or even as flue-cured for that matter). Both lines were crossed with three selec tions of Connecticut broadleaf inbreds. These inbreds were and three agr onomically desirable broadleaf inbreds that were susceptible to all diseases. C2 is a va riety that was developed with resistance to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) that coincidentally carried resistance to Fusarium wilt. It was used as a source of wilt resistance in developing broadleaf lines such as C9. C2 was developed by the CAES and released in 1961. The initial hybrids between CT and flue-c ured types were backcrossed twice to CT broadleaf to restore broadleaf characteristics, and then inbred over 10 generations. Plants were selected for agronomic type under field conditions using a system of modified single seed descent in which onl y the top 2% of plants (20 plants of 1,000 grown) were selected for the next generation. Plants were additionally selected for TMV The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 205 and TCN resistance in greenhouse screens. The resulting inbred (F10 generation) was not of suitable quality, so it was backcrossed ag ain to the broadleaf va riety 'Scantic' (A7) and again selfed to an inbred using pedigree selection with field and greenhouse selection for resistance and agronomic broadleaf tob acco characteristics. The resulting inbreds were progeny tested to select plants with stable homozygous resistance to TMV and the TCN and were evaluated for Fusarium wilt and blue mold resistance. The result of this breeding program was 27 generations of selection for broadleaf agronomic characteristics with 8 cycles of selection each for Fusarium wilt, TMV and TCN resistance. The male-sterile F1 hybrid B2 is highly resistant to Fusarium wilt, TMV and the TCN. An unexpected benefit that Dr. LaMondia discovere d was that the TCN- resistant inbred parent used to make the B2 hybrid was fairly resistant to blue mold and the B2 hybrid itself was also moderately resist ant to the disease. Blue mold leaf spot, caused by the downy mildew pathogen Peronospora tabacina , has been a recurring problem in Connecticut from 1997 through 2009, causing losses up to the tens of millions of dollars annually. As a result, growers must apply fungicides on a regular basis to protect against the disease. When compared to the highly resistant tobacco varieties NC 2000 and NC 2002 developed in North Carolina, the moderately resistant varieties KT 200 and KT 206 developed in Kentucky and Tenne ssee, and susceptible C9 broadleaf in the same experiment, B2 was intermediate to the highly resistant NC lines and moderately resistant KT lines. This resi stance was likely confe rred by the VA-81 or PD- 4 parents and carried through th e selection process along with TCN resistance. This may not be totally unexpected as resistance gene s are often clustered together on certain chromosomes and can be carried along with selection for resistance to other diseases. For example, the Cuban dark-fired variety H 2000 was bred for blue mold resistance but is also resistant to the TCN in our tests. Fusarium wilt resistance was carried into commercial tobacco (such as C2) from th e wild tobacco parent along with TMV resistance, and TCN resistance was itself carried along unknowingly fr om a wild tobacco species to commercial tobacco types in associ ation with resistance to wildfire bacteria. Plant resistance is the only practical mean s of control for Fusarium wilt and TMV. The effects of TCN resistance are more economi cal and actually better than preplant soil fumigation (which costs approximately $500 per acre) as tobacco cyst nematode populations that have been reduced by the fumi gation subsequently incr ease as a result of growing a susceptible tobacco variety. TCN re sistant B2 causes cyst nematodes to hatch, enter roots, and then die as a result of re sistance, effectively re ducing cyst nematode populations by more than 60% while stil l producing a tobacco crop. Blue mold resistance would act to reduce the number of fungicide applications required to control the disease and increase crop quality. Over several years at the CAES Valley Laboratory Research Farm and in small plots with coope rating growers, B2 wra pper leaf quality was consistently as good as or bett er than the current broadleaf standard inbred variety C9. The use of an inbred with growers saving seed from year to year often results in genetic drift and the loss of resistance to pathogens over time. The use of a male sterile hybrid that does not produce seed will result in a st able, uniform variety with no genetic drift over time. 206 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Impacts: The development of a male -sterile hybrid broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco with resistance to most of the major pathogens , including Fusarium wilt, TMV, the TCN and blue mold, should allow sustainable crop pr oduction with reduced losses to disease and much reduced pesticide inputs. Potato Virus Y Disease in Tobacco: In late June 2009, stunted shade and broa dleaf cigar wrapper tobacco plants in Massachusetts were observed with veinbandi ng, mosaic, and leaf mottle symptoms. As leaves near the top of the plant matured, they often curled und er on the edges and developed fleck or etch symptoms. Some pl ants developed veinal necrosis. Symptoms were consistent with Poty viruses and plan ts were tested using two types of enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a broad ACP ELISA based on a monoclonal antibody (MAb) that detects all aphid-transm itted poty viruses, and a TSA ELISA with polyclonal (PAb) and MAb that acts as a unive rsal detection probe specific for Potato Virus Y (PVY). Plants were also tested us ing PAb tests for Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV), and Tobacco Vein Mottle Virus (TVMV). Dr. LaMondia transferred tobacco aphids (Myzus had fed for one week upon symp tomatic broadleaf tobacco plant to nonsymptomatic tobacco plants. Three weeks after aphid transfer, target plants were symptomatic and both source and target plants tested positive for Poty, PVY, TEV and TVMV. Nonsymptomatic plants without aphids were negative for viruses. Symptoms in tobacco were initially widespread and se vere in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts and eventually spread to nor thern Connecticut. At least 3000 acres of potatoes were present near the earliest a ffected area in Massachusetts and volunteer potato plants were found in high incidence in fields rotated from potato in 2008 to tobacco in 2009. Growers indicated that volunteer potato tubers survived overwinter in both 2008 and 2009. Early symptom development was greatest for tobacco in close proximity to potato crops. It is known that many species of aphids transmit these viruses in a nonpersistent manner. Soil temperatures recorded at 20 cm deep in Windsor CT were as low as -4.7 C in 2007, and only as low as -1.85 C in 2008 and 2009. Critical temperatures for potato tuber de ath were reported to be -2.8 C or lower, so temperatures were consistent with observations of volunteer tuber surviv al in 2008 and 2009. Solanaceous crops, such as potato, can serve as virus reservoirs, and volunteer tuber survival two years in a row may have increased virus incidence for early-season transmission by aphids. Seve rely affected tobacco crops were unmarketable as cigar wrapper tobacco and destroyed. Insurance claims on crop losses were evaluated by adjustors for type of loss and tobacco crops we re tested for the presence of poty viruses by a commercial testing laboratory as a requirement for insurance claims. Loss adjustment took into consideration all cause s of loss and adjusted tobacco crop damage for multiple causes (for example, 75% may have been due to virus infection and 25% due to excess precipitation). Insurance estimates were provided based on the unusual severity and concluded that over 600 acres of shade and broadleaf tobacco in Massachusetts and Connecticut were destroyed as a result of inf ection by one or more (o ften all three) of PVY, TEV, and TVMV poty viruses. Total indemnity due to poty virus infection was The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 207 over $4,750,000 for crops that would have had a value of approximately $10,000,000 if harvested and sold at typical crop values. Additional quality losses in harvested and cured tobacco further increased the impact of the disease on the 2009 crop. This is the first report of significant economic loss associ ated with Poty virus diseases in cigar wrapper tobacco in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Drs. LaMondia, Smith and Ferrandino monitored winter soil temperatures at different depths in Connecticut and Massachusetts and concluded th at potato tuber overwinter survival would only occur in protected areas and not in large open fields as in the past tw o years. They also monitored early-season aphid movement into tobacco and te sted for infection of plants with PVY. PVY-infected (left) and healthy broadleaf tobacco plants (right). Impacts: Information associating severe crop lo sses with PVY and the source of virus inoculum as well as the predic tion of potato tuber survival based on soil temperatures and the magnitude of virus inoculum reservoirs for the 2010 season allowed growers to make informed decisions on planting and early season aphid management options. Tobacco IPM Dr. Hugh Smith conducted a survey of tobacco growers' pest management priorities in February. This was the first survey of its kind carried out in decades. Important information on grower-perceived inse ct pest priorities a nd pesticide use was gathered. Insecticide trails aimed at suppressing aphids and aphid-borne viruses were initiated at the Valley Lab in June 2010 and experimentation with insect-excluding shade material has also been initiated. 208 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Impact: Greater utilization of effective insecticid es with improved environmental profiles will help tobacco growers reduce insecticide use and lessen environmental impacts. Rotation crops for nematode management Annual rotation crops of grain pearl millet were evaluated as rotation or green manure crops for suppression of plots in by Dr. LaMondia in Connecticut and cooperator Dr. J. Halbrend t in Pennsylvania. Field plots were established in both states. Camelina, rapese ed, buckwheat, grain millet and sesame were seeded, and Rudbeckia hirta plots were established usi ng 5-week-old transplants. Nematodes were counted from soil samples taken pre-plant, mid-season and two weeks after incorporating the crops as green manure in August. Lesion nematodes were also extracted from cover crop roots mid-season in Connecticut. Following the green manure treatment, all plots were planted with cereal rye ( Secale cereale ) as a lesion nematode bait plant in September. Nematodes were extr acted from soil samples taken in October in Pennsylvania and from rye roots collected in early December in Connecticut. There were no differences in preplant nematode densities in soil (lesion and dagger nematodes ranged from 0 to 8 and 0 to 61 in Connecticut and 0 to 17 and 0 to 37 in Pennsylvania per 100 cm 3 soil, respectively). The numbers of Pratylenchus recovered from rotation crop roots sampled just prior to crop incorporation were also not different. Lesion and dagger nematode population levels in soil sampled prior to crop incorporation did not differ between rotation crops. Xiphinema numbers in soil were lowest after incorporation of the Brassica crops Camelina and Dwarf Essex. Buckwheat, pearl millet and sesame appeared to be good hosts and R. hirta was a moderate host for dagger nematodes. Pratylenchus populations recovered from rye root s following sesame were higher than from all other rotation crops. Few lesion nema todes were detected in soil and none in the rye roots following R. hirta incorporation. Impacts: Rotation crops offer an environmentally friendly alternative to chemicals for nematode control but as this research de monstrates, it is important to know which nematodes are present and what effect a rotation crop may have on the population. Rotation crops may effectively reduce plant pa rasitic nematode populations, but can have different impacts against different nematodes. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 209 Rotation crops for nematode management. Weed research: Dr. Todd Mervosh conducts research on weed mana gement in a variety of crop systems and at non-agricultural sites. In the past year, his projects included weed control experiments in ornamental plants grown in containers, Christmas trees, and pumpkins. These experiments were conducted at the CAES Valley Laboratory in Windsor and/or in growers' fields or nurseries. Dr. Ahrens is a research partner in some experiments involving ornamentals and Christmas trees. In addition, Dr. Mervosh has projects underway to find effective and environmenta lly sound methods to control the following (phragmites), pale swallowwort, gian t hogweed and Japanese stiltgrass. Dr John F. Ahrens , Plant Scientist Emeritus has completed almost 18 years of service at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Statio n's Valley Laboratory following his official retirement in 1992 after 35 years of servic e. By cooperating in the National IR-4 program and obtaining safety and efficacy data in experiments, he has helped to obtain federal and state registrations for all of the current herbicide tools that are available for use by Connecticut and regional growers. Invasive plants: Mile-a-minute vine, Polygonum perfoliatum, originated from Asia and was first discovered in the eastern U.S. in the 1930s and is classified as a noxious weed in Connecticut. It currently infest s 9 eastern states and was firs t recorded in Connecticut in 210 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 1997. In Connecticut, 18 towns are curren tly infested and the number is rapidly increasing in 2009. This rapidl y growing prickly and prolific vine is annual in its northern range but quickly forms dense thic kets which displace na tive vegetation and reduces plant diversity. An introduced weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes , has been successfully reared and released for control of this invasive species in the Mid-Atlantic States. However, weevil rearing is dependent on greenhouse propagati on of the vine and the development of an artificial diet for ma ss rearing would be beneficial in improving efficiency, space required for mass production an d enhancing survival during shipments. Dr. Cheah is collaborating with Dr. Allen Cohen on the development of an artificial diet for R. latipes in cooperation with the Phillip A llampi Beneficial Insect Laboratory (PABIL), New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Trenton, NJ, with funding support from the USDA Forest Service. Mile-a-minute vine in Greenwich, CT. Results: Dr. Cheah and Dr. Cohen have developed se veral base nutritional diets and extracts (solid and liquid) from m ile-a-minute vines (stems, leaves and combinations of stems and leaves ) which elicit adult and larval R. latipes feeding and continue to work on refining and impr oving the palatability and texture of the best diets. In 2009, Dr. Cheah tested 5 diets from Dr. Cohen, using newly emerged adult R. latipes provided by NJDA. A few i ndividuals were seen feeding on one modified diet with whey protein and there was 100% adu lt survival for one week on that diet alone. Survival was 75% at two weeks but at 3 weeks, there was 0% survival. During the first two w eeks, weevils were also observed to be mating and defecating, and there a color ch ange in adults fr om predominately black to speckled black and orange, indicating consumption of diet material. This The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 211 finding was encouraging as pr evious diets had not attract ed adults to feed nor supported any prolonged survival in the absence of the host plant. Dr. Cheah has been developing laboratory methods to study adult weevil oviposition and feeding behavior, improve egg handling techniques for the study of diet response of immature st ages. Behavioral observations of R. latipes feeding and oviposition in the laboratory indicate that weevils feed and deposit eggs on developing seed heads of P. polygonum. Impact: A suitable artificial diet for R. latipes would enhance mass rearing for the expanding biological control program of mile-a -minute vine which is currently based on live plant cultures. Implementation of Biological Control of Mile-A-Minute Vine A collaboration between Drs. Cheah and Mervosh of the Valley Laboratory and Donna Ellis from the University of C onnecticut, resulted in a release of 7,000 R. latipes with federal approval in Connecticut in 2009 for the first time in 5 towns: North Haven, Greenwich, Newtown, New Milfor d and Bridgewater, in coope ration with the University of Delaware, NJDA PABIL, DEP (CT) and with the support of USDA Forest Service and USDA APHIS PPQ. Weevils have survived th e Connecticut winter and an intense March flooding and in all 2009 release sites, there were signs of overwintering survival, feeding damage to MAM, reproduction and a new generation of weevils in mid-June 2010. Additional releases of 6,000 R. latipes were implemented in mid-May 2010 in the towns of Stamford, Westport and Fairfield. 212 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 Impacts: Connecticut is now an active participant in the increasingly important arena of biological control research of invasive weeds with 13,000 weevils released to control mile-a-minute vine in the western portion of the state Establishment of biocontrols for mile-a -minute vine would provide a natural control to limit spread and range expans ion of a noxious and prolific invasive weed, and reduce the need for chemical c ontrol, especially in watershed areas Christmas Trees Dr. Cowles tested dinotefuran used as a ba sal trunk spray in Christmas tree plantations to suppress armored scales dem onstrated that this product can be useful, especially on trees 6 feet tall or shorter, fo r integrating chemical a nd biological control. A regression model from field data related in a single equation the degree of population suppression (probit scale) to th e logarithm of the dosage and th e cube of the height of the trees. Growers in CT, PA, and RI are now adopting this method to suppress scale populations in their plantings. Impact: Many Christmas tree growers have adopted the dinotefuran basal trunk spray to suppress armored scales in their plantings . Other growers are continuing to use the foliar application of bifenthrin for th e same purpose. Both approaches were developed by Dr. Cowles. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Requests for information: A total of 6,011 inquiries were answered at the Valley Laboratory during the past year. The majority of these queries (75%) were answered by Dr. Mervosh (1,883), and Ms. Rose Hiskes (1,274) in the inquiry office, and by Dr. LaMondia (1,838). About 61% of the information requests were from the public sector; the remainder was from commercial growers and pest control operators. Valley Lab scientists made 118 presentati ons to grower, professional and citizen groups, (approximately 5678 people), were in terviewed 17 times and made 289 visits to commercial and municipal fields, nurseries, greenhouses, Christmas tree farms, forests and private landscapes to diagnose complex problems or conduct research projects. Dr. LaMondia initiated and maintained the Blue Mold Information Line recorded phone message and a Connecticut River Valley Blue Mold Web Site to keep tobacco growers current with the progr ess of blue mold in North America, and the potential exposure and management options in the Valley. He worked with the CT DEP to obtain a Section 18 registration for Revus fungicide for control of Phytophthora blight in snap beans in CT. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 213 Soil testing: A total of 4,390 soil tests we re expertly performed by Ms. Diane Riddle during the past year. About 56% were perfor med for commercial growers, 38% for homeowners, 4% for municipalities, and the remainder for Station research. Of the commercial samples submitted, 57% were for landscapers; 28% for tobacco growers; 3% for vegetable growers, 4% nursery grower s; 3% for golf course superintendents; 3% for fruit growers, 1% for Christmas tree growers; and the remainder for all other categories. Gordon S. Taylor Conference Room: Many agricultural organizations used the conference room at the Valley Laboratory regularly for their meetings. Du ring the past year, 24 different groups used the room on 56 occasions. Our most frequent users were the Connecticut Rhododendron Society, Connecticut Invasive Plants Council, Connecticut Farmland Trust, Connecticut Invasive Plants Working Group, the CT Wine Association, Connecticut Chapter of the National Organic Farmers Association, Connect icut Department of Agriculture, and the Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Association. Ms. Jane Canepa-Morrison scheduled the appointments and James Preste arranged the furniture for scheduled meetings and ensured that the room was available after hours. 214 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | Record of the Year 2009-2010 SCIENTIFIC JOURNA L ARTICLES PUBLISHE D BY OUR STAFF DURING 2009-2010 DEPARTMENT OF ANAL YTICAL CHEMISTRY Li, X., W.
