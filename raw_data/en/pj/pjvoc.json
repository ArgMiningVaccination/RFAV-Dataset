By their behaviours, leaders create theconditions that either hinder or aid 5Introduction for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 3While there h ave been impressive improvements in outcomes and services in the NHS over the p ast dec ade, this h as also cre ated ever-rising p atient and public expect ations for something even better. The current glob al financial picture me ans that over the coming ye ars we need to deliver an even higher qu ality NHS, providing even better p atient experiences of c are, but with less resources. Innov ation is needed to deliver these expect ations. We need le aders at all levels who c an support and cre ate a culture in their te ams, dep artments, organisations and he alth systems th at channels the energy of all staff into thinking differently. While in a recent study1innov ation w as identified as a priority in 59% of NHS org anisations, two-thirds of NHS staff respondents st ated th at they were not adequately supported to undert ake innov ation activities, and more th an one-third s aid that developing and embedding an improvement culture w as a challenge in their organisation. We need to rise to the ch allenge to build and utilise the confidence, skills, wisdom and experience of the entire workforce for the t ask ahead. 1 Visit our website for more inform ation on the full report, NHS Innov ation and Improvement Survey 2009 Report at www.institute.nhs.uk/innov ationInnovation and the NHS today \"Without innovation,public services costs tend to rise faster than the rest of the economy.

Throughout this guide we will use the terms 'org anisation' and 'system' interch angeably. You should interpret this as it rel ates to the v arious settings in which you work. For ex ample, as a clinic al lead or m anager, or executive in a provider org anisation, you m ay be m ainly interested in cre ating the conditions for innov ation in your te am, service, dep artment, or Trust. Commissioners, or clinic al or m anagerial leads of p athways of c are, will be interested in cre ating the conditions across a system th at spans org anisational bound aries. Innov ation and service improvement le ads might be working at various times on projects within or across org anisational bound aries. The concepts, tips and tools apply equ ally well to all these settings. 4 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersGuide to creating the culture for innovation This guide describes: \u0081the seven dimensions th at imp act on culture for innov ation \u0081three w ays to use the fr amework of the seven dimensions to identify and address g aps \u0081the NHS Institute's online Culture for Innov ation arking tool \u0081thirty-seven tips innov ationCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 21/6/10 11:23 Page 8Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 5 Other resources available from the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement include... www.institute.nhs.uk/innovation Thinking Differently is a comprehensive guide, aimed prim arily at front-line st aff, that provides a three-step process and 14 tools for stimul ating innov ative thinking.

Both increment al change and step ch ange are useful and desir able. However, bec ause a step ch ange challenges \"the w ay it h as always been,\" org anisational culture is an even stronger f actor in determining whether the ch ange occurs. What about the spread of change? Spread is a related, but independent issue th at, in the end, dict ates the over all imp act of a change. While an increment al change m ay have only a small imp act in the setting in which it is first implemented, it c an have a large imp act on the he alth system or the NHS as a whole if it is subsequently spre ad and adopted by others. Further, while a step ch ange c an make a big difference in the site th at implements it, it might m ake very little difference in the system as a whole if it not widely spre ad.

The next section describes the seven dimensions of culture for innovation and the liter ature b ase behind each. You c an get a quick overview by simply studying the summ ary diagram on p age 9 and quickly re ading the synopsis at the beginning of e ach dimension. However, we suggest th at you f amiliarise yourself with the details behind e ach dimension before you try to present the fr amework to others. This is followed by an applications section. It is import ant that you f amiliarise yourself with all of the m aterial in this section in order to get a good underst anding of the v arious w ays that you might use the seven dimensions fr amework. The appendices provide more det ail supporting e ach of the three applications described. The largest section is the one providing thirty-seven tips on how to enh ance e ach dimension. While we believe th at your thinking will be stimul ated by re ading this entire section, you could w ait until you h ave done an assessment of your te am, dep artment, org anisation or system and then study in det ail the dimensions th at you most need to address.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 118 Seven dimensions of culturein an innovativeorganisation orsystemCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 12Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 9Evidence supports the conclusion th at organisational culture is a major factor affecting the speed and frequency of innov ation (Smith et. al. 2008). While the bulk of the liter ature comes from outside the public sector and health, the few studies th at do cover this context are consistent with the findings from other industries. This is not surprising. People are people and the org anisational cultur al factors th at they experience as enabling or disempowering with reg ards to innov ative thinking are characteristic of a social system, reg ardless of industry. We h ave compiled the common themes across these studies into a framework of 27 constructs org anised under seven dimensions (see di agram below).Framework and evidence \u0081 Emotional support \u0081 Balanced assessment\u0081 g from failure rather than g new thin gs \u0081 \u0081T i m e\u0081 Authority to act \u0081 What, but not how \u0081 Specific call for innovation \u0081 Tie to strate gic plan \u0081 'Stretch'\u0081Clear g, open environment \u0081 Team based work Relationships Risk Taking Resources Knowledge Goals\u0081 Wide scope search \u0081 Uncensored, unfiltered, unsummarised \u0081 Free-flowin gRewardsToolsCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 13If you are anxious to get st arted with pr acticalities, you m ay be s atisfied with the overview in the di agram on the previous p age and w ant to move right onto the next section describing three applications of the framework. If you need a bit more inform ation you could addition ally read the synopsis provided for e ach dimension. However, we suggest th at you eventu ally familiarise yourself with the full det ails reg arding the evidence behind e ach dimension before you present the fr amework to others so th at you c an address questions. We begin this section with a brief description of the rese arch approach that we took in developing the seven dimensions. It is import ant to underst and the n ature of the liter ature in this field in contr ast to typic al health literature. Then, for e ach dimension, we summ arise the key supporting evidence. Fin ally, we give sever al examples of wh at highly innov ative org anisations do to enh ance their culture.Navigating this section 10 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersThe seven dimensions of culture provide a lens that can help leaders take steps to enhance the conditions for innovation.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 14Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 11Our efforts to org anisational culture for are ch allenged by the very n ature of the subject. Studies attempting to underst and the specific f actors linking org anisational culture and perform ance tend to find somewh at different key aspects (Plsek 2003). It is not surprising th at 'culture' is h ard to pin down when we underst and th at healthcare org anisations are complex systems (Plsek & Greenh algh 2001). There are many variables to consider. Wh at a researcher chooses to look at, and how she or he looks at it, will influence wh at is seen. Because of this, we took a pragmatic approach in seeking to identify a few actionable aspects of org anisational culture th at evidence suggests will influence innov ation. Our go al was to provide a tool th at can guide you to begin the evolution of your te am, dep artment, org anisation or system - a tool th at helps you le arn and adapt as you go along. Using this approach, which comes from wh at is called 'design science' 2007; v an Aken 2007), the dimensions of culture are suggestive: \"If you do X, it is somewh at more likely th at Y will h appen\". We m ay never h ave the luxury of org anisational culture frameworks th at are qu antitatively (st atistically) predictive, as in the tr adition al science p aradigm; \"Y=f(x): If you do this much X, you will get this much Y, plus or minus some st atistical variation\". We conducted an initi al literature se arch in 2001 th at identified the seven dimensions and beg an working with several health care org anisations in the UK and other countries to confirm the f ace validity and usefulness of the model. We then commissioned an upd ated and more extensive liter ature se arch from an independent org anisation in 2008. This re-confirmed the fr amework, while resulting in some enh ancements (B aldwin and Garrow 2008). The v ast majority of liter ature about the links between org anisational culture and innov ation is outside he alth care and not e asily se arched system atically. However, we g ave preference to the rel atively sp arse liter ature on innov ation from he althcare and the public sector. The liter ature on org anisational culture is of a different gr ade comp ared to the medic al literature. The v ast majority of the culture liter ature is expert opinion and case studies, with some well-designed observ ational research and regression analysis using survey instruments, along with only the occ asional controlled study in an org anisational setting. Despite the st atistical limit ations of the design science p aradigm and the qu ality of the liter ature in this field, we believe th at pragmatic, suggestive tools b ased on expert opinion and case studies c an be helpful to those who wish to guide their org anisational cultures into a constructive evolution of incre ased innov ation. Using the NHS Institute's design approach involving co-production and field testing h as shown this to be true in our pilot tests with sever al NHS org anisations across the country.Development of the culture for innovation frameworkCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 15Synopsis Risk t aking is about est ablishing an org anisational clim ate where people feel able to try out new ide as. While it is obviously import ant to avoid t aking in appropri ate risk, a healthy org anisational culture seeks a balanced assessment th at avoids prem aturely rejecting ide as due to over-estim ation of risk. It also requires le aders who show they are quick to provide emotion al support to those willing to try something new, reg ardless of whether the ide a is eventu ally judged a success or 'f ailure'. Le aders in innov ative org anisations demonstr ate that they are more interested in le arning from f ailure th an in punishing it. What the literature tells us While there are many definitions of innov ation, a common theme is th at the pr actice is new or different from the st atus quo in some w ay (Schumpter 1939, Rogers 1995, von Hipple 1988). Doing something new always entails some risk of the unknown. Jaskyte's (2009) rese arch on innov ation in 20 hum an services org anisations in the US found th at the most innov ative ones were \"willing to experiment, quick to t ake advantage of opportunities, and risk t aking\". Miller and Oileros' (2007) study of innov ation in multi-n ational corpor ations identified f actors such as learning by doing as key. AT Ke arney's \"Best Innov ator 2004-2007 Competition\" found th at \"openness new ide as\" was one of the fe atures th at distinguished innov ation le aders. A study undert aken by the N ational School of Government (Dennis, T anner, W alker 2005) identified sever al ingredients th at indic ate the import ance of a balanced assessment of risk th at were common in org anisations in the public sector th at excelled. Among these were: \"cle ar and simple risk m anagement processes th at are embedded in decision m aking and in the w ay the org anisation works\" and \"a decision m aking culture where the ation is to ch allenge and be ch and evidence\". However, Christensen and colle agues (2002) note th at the typic al structures of he alth care org anisations around regul ation compli ance and committees of est ablished individu als, while h aving their obvious strong points, often reinforce the st atus quo and block new ide as.Risk Taking 12 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersReview of the literature - Dimensions of culture for innovationCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 16Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 13Adams (1986) and Basadur (1995) noted \"fe ar to m ake a mistake\" and \"fe ar of appearing foolish and looking bad before others\" as key blockers of cre ativity in org anisations. Dewett's (2004) liter ature review concluded that the emotion al support and beh aviours of supervisors and peers following cre ative efforts pl ayed a key role in employees' subsequent willingness to t ake risks. Clegg and colle agues (2002) found in a study in two l arge aerosp ace firms a signific ant correl ation between the trust th at design engineers h ad that they would be heard and supported if they put forth an innov ative ide a, and the number of ide as submitted and implemented. Learning from f ailure is a key theme in the biogr aphical research on gre at innov ators. Thom as Watson, founder of IBM, f amously rem arked th at, \"The fastest way to succeed is to double your failure rate\". In describing the process th at led to his best-selling v acuum cle aner, Sir J ames Dyson noted, \"I made 5,127 prototypes before I got it right. But I learned from each one. So, I don't mind failure.\" This ethos is institution alised in innov ative org anisations such as Johnson and Johnson where \"freedom to f ail\" is articulated as a \"key v alue\".CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 1714 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersExamples reflecting this dimension CEO of SAS UKJim Goodnight notes that his organisation works hard tocreate a corporate culture that\"encourages employees to try newthings and yet doesn't penalise them fortaking chances.\" At animation studio Pixar , the practice of showingunfinished work each day liberates people to take risksand try new things because it doesn't have to be perfectthe first time. 3M reward 'intelligent' risk taking, tryingnew things and learning from failure. Ideas are allowed to go ahead to further testing oreven release to customers, as long as risks areacknowledged up-front, studied as well as can beexpected short of actually doing the test of theidea, and mitigated against to the extentreasonably possible. One of 3M's foundationalprinciples is: \"Management that is destructivelycritical when mistakes are made kills initiative;and it is essential that we have many people withinitiative if we are to continue to grow.\"CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 18Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 15 CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 1916 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersSynopsis The resources dimension considers the bro adest sense of the word. The clim ate for innov ation is enh anced if people know th at they h ave the 'resource' of authority and autonomy to act on innov ative ide as. While innov ative ide as do not necess arily need a lot of money or time to develop, st aff can become demor alised if these tr adition al resources are not available and can feel th at there is no point in putting forw ard a new ide a. The presence of concrete resources sign al that the org anisation is t aking innov ation seriously. What the literature tells us Smith and colle agues (2008) cited the availability of resources for innov ation as one of sever al \"key f actors\" in their structured review of 102 p apers. A m anagerial practice th at emerged as positively affecting cre ativity in Am abile's (1998) study of high-tech rese arch and development l abs was the provision of \"resources in the form of time and money\". In a Cabinet Office Str ategy Unit report, Mulg an and Albury (2003) also reviewed the innov ation liter ature and suggested th at \"cre ating time, e.g. through awaydays or al\" innov ation the public Rese archers at the He alth Services M anagement Centre at the University of Birmingh am, commissioned by the E ast Midl ands SHA to review the liter ature and suggest w ays to promote innov ation, also recommended \"cre ating sl ack\" so th at staff had the time to think cre atively (Willi ams, de Silv a, Ham 2008). Interestingly, given the pressures and resource constr aints we often see in the he alth service, Amabile (1998) also noted from her review of end-of-d ay reflection reports from high-tech designers th at Resources \"people can think very creatively under severe time pressure if they are able to concentrate or focus on a single issue or challenge for asignificant part of the day.\"CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 20Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 17Another key m anagerial practice from Am abile's (1998) study w as \"freedom to decide how to meet a challenge\". Beugelsdijk's (2008) analysis of HR pr actices and innov ation in 988 Dutch firms likewise found th at organisations permitting higher levels of t ask autonomy and more flexible working hours gener ated more product innov ations. Conversely, a meta-analysis by D amanpour (1991) showed th at the centr alisation of decision-m aking autonomy within an org anisation w as neg atively associated with the r ate of adoption of multiple innov ations. K anter (2002) summed it up tounge-in-cheek in one of her \"cl assic rules for stifling innov ation\"; n amely, \"insist th at people who need your approv al to act go through sever al layers of other managers first\". Examples reflecting this dimension Both Nike and Asda encourage employeesto \"think for two hours a day\". The \"GameChanger\" programme at Shell OilCompany fosters innovative ideas from staffby \"providing appropriate, staged financingfor their development\". The programme \"strives to develop realbusinesses that are outside and between thecompany's existing lines of enterprise byfollowing a process outside the constraints andpriorities of Shell's day-to-day business\". Google allows its employees to set aside 20% of their time for innovation and use it to develop projects that they feelpassionately about. Engineers at Hewlett-Packard areencouraged to spend up to 10% oftheir time on their own petprojects and have 24-hour accessto laboratories and equipment. At Gore Tex, staff get to spend 10% of their workhours as 'dabble time' to develop their own ideas. 3Mhave a HR policy that allows all staff to spend up to 15% of their timeworking on promising new ideas, andprovides even more resources and timefor those ideas that meet criteriaindicating that they show the mostpromise.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 21Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 18Synopsis Broad-based knowledge is the fuel for innov ation. We cre ate better conditions for innov ation when inform ation, both from within and outside the org anisation or system, is widely g athered, e asily accessible, rapidly tr ansmitted, and honestly communic ated. Since we c annot know in advance wh at knowledge might stimul ate an innov ative ide a, censoring, filtering or over-summ arising inform ation detr acts from this dimension. What the literature tells us Liao's (2006) rese arch in T aiwanese al ad a signific ant influence on innov ation. W an, Ong and Lee (2005) showed th at \"willingness to exch ange ide as\" was correl ated to firm innov ation in a data set from 71 comp anies in Sing apore. B ased on org anisational studies in Europe and the US, H ansen and Birkinsh aw (2007) identified \"cross-pollin ation\" and \"free-flowing knowledge\" from a wide v ariety of sources as key elements in wh at they ain\". Simil arly, Robinson and Stern (1998) identified diverse stimuli, forums where such input is openly sh ared, serendipity, and within-comp any communic ations as features of all of the innov ation events they studied at leading US and Japanese firms. Summ arising the liter ature, Smith and colle augues' (2008) system atic review of over 100 p apers found \"knowledge m anagement\" to be a key factor in innov ation m anagement. But how ex actly does all this knowledge le ad to innov ation? Citing three studies, M adjar (2005) notes th at the \"literature suggests that unique information and knowledge provided by dissimilar individuals may enable the employee to seenew connections between concepts and issues and to approachproblems from different directions\".KnowledgeCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 22Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 19Damanpour's (1991) met a-analysis found th at the degree of org anisation members' involvement and participation in extr a-organisational profession al activities w as positively associated with innov ativeness. Likewise, Root-Bernstein, Bernstein, and Garnier's (1993) reviews of l aboratory notebooks found evidence that creative scientists obt ain inform ation from a wider array of topics th an less cre ative ones. Expert opinion also supports the import ance of the knowledge dimension in a culture for innov ation. The University of Birmingh am's He alth Services M anagement Centre summ arised their review of this topic in the innov ation liter ature by recommending th at the NHS \"make it easy to find and share knowledge about innovation, learn from organisations that have a track record of innovation, and fosterlinks with private sector organisations\" Williams, de Silv a and Ham, 2008. To be most effective, knowledge must flow freely to everyone in an org anisation. Ankl am, Cross and Gul as (2005) suggest methods for promoting \"democr atic and lateral\" communic ation - newsletters, semin ars, online forums and brown b ag lunches - and note th at \"all are historic ally proven w ays of cre ating and maintaining awareness of knowledge for working across org anisational bound aries\". K anter (2002) dr aws attention to the need for free-flowing inform ation by suggesting th at a good w ay to stifle innov ation is to \"make sure th at requests for inform ation are fully justified, don't give it out freely\".CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 23Examples reflecting this dimension 20 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders Merck's head of R&D states,\"Every senior scientist hererunning a project should think ofherself or himself as being incharge of all the research in thatfield. Not just the 30 peopleworking in our lab but the 3,000people, say, in the world workingin that field.\" The highly-successful design firm, IDEO, encourages its designers to transfer ideas across their project and teamboundaries. Organisational routines for the acquisition,storage and retrieval of solutions are embedded in theculture and supported by work structures. New employeesare encouraged to seek and give help as required and toshare their knowledge. Proctor & Gamble has seta stretch goal of having 50percent of its new projectportfolio come from ideasoriginating outside its innovation, we're not just talkingabout technology. Ifsomeone has figured out abetter way to communicatewith the consumer, that'sof great interest to us.

Linking these to str ategic priorities and being able to articulate a clear, multi- faceted c ase of need, further sign als the import ance of the c all for innov ation. However there is a caution. Innov ative thinking is stifled when le aders go beyond st atements of wh at needs to be achieved and also become prescriptive as to how it must be achieved. What the literature tells us The import ance of go als for innov ation c an be tr aced to soci al psychologic al theory, which suggests th at one of the most import ant antecedents for innov ative activity is \"vision, an ide a of a valued outcome which represents a higher order go al and motiv ating force at work\" (West 1990). Robinson and Stern (1998) studied successful innov ation processes in US and Japanese firms and noted th at alignment with the comp any's key str ategic go als was a feature in every c ase. They suggested th at this direction- pointing helped employees recognise and respond to a potenti ally useful ide a. Lapierre and Giroux's (2003) more rigorous study focused on high-tech org anisations also concluded th at alignment of cre ative thinking with organisational goals was a \"valid and reli able predictor\" of implemented innov ation. Further evidence comes from Smith and colle agues' (2008) system atic review of over 100 p apers th at identified alignment of innov ation goals with corpor ate strategy as one of the key f actors imp acting on an organisation's ability to m anage innov ation. The N ational School of Government's study of org anisations th at excel found th at an import ant ingredient in their success w as a clearly articulated \"imper ative to innov ation\" (Dennis, Such imper ative le ads highly innov ative org anisations to stretch their aspirations beyond wh at might be immedi ately achiev able. Collins and Porr as (1994) studied 18 comp anies th at had survived as leaders over dec ades of change in their industries and 18 comp arison comp anies th at did not. One of their findings w as the presence in the successful org anisations of wh at they c alled \"big, h airy, audacious go als\" (BHAGs) th at drove the organisation to unim aginable levels of perform ance over long time horizons (see ex amples below). Echoing this insight, innov ation expert G ary Hammel advises th at organisations looking to innov ate \"must h ave the courage to set seemingly aggressive objectives\" if they are truly to sp awn cre ativity (B arsh 2007).Goals Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 22CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 26Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 23While it m ay be the le ader's role to set the go als, providing autonomy to m anagers and staff on the me ans for getting there is a clear conclusion in the innov ation liter ature. For ex ample, Am abile (1998) st ates, \"Clearly specified strategic goals often enhance people's creativity... Creativity thrives when managers let people decide how to climb amountain; they needn't, however, let employees choose which one\". Examples reflecting this dimension Examples of \"big, hairy, audacious goals\"(BHAGs) include: Sony (circa 1955) - Change the worldwideimage of Japanese products as poor quality;create a pocketable transistor radio.NASA (circa 1962) - Put a man on the moon andreturn him safely by the end of this decade.Google: Organize the world's information andmake it universally accessible and useful.Amazon.com: Every book, ever printed, in anylanguage, all available in less than 60 seconds. In order for the financialservices firm CharlesSchwab to introduce itsbreakthrough innovationof an online brokerageservice back in the early1990s it needed to re-alignits goals. The proposed new online channel would be in directconflict with its traditionaltelephone and face-to-facebusiness. What wouldmotivate employees, whosebonuses were tied totraditional activity targets,to support the new service?A large team of seniorleaders at Schwab'sheadquarters went out tobranches to discuss withstaff, sometimes in lateevening sessions, the higherstrategic goal of exemplarycustomer service. Further,even in a culture that foryears had focused individual performance,Schwab re-aligned itsbonus system to among thevarious parts of its serviceoffering. No broker couldget his or her individualperformance bonus untilcollective goals acrossservice lines had beenachieved. Every employee at Dyson is ingrained with the need to innovate and an understanding of thebasics of product development. For example,every new member of staff assembles a vacuumcleaner on their first day and is asked to provideideas for how to make it better.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 2724 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersSynopsis Rewards for innov ation are symbols and ritu als whose m ain purpose is to recognise innov ative beh aviour. They sign al how much v alue is given, or not, to the efforts of individu als and te ams who come up with new ways to help the org anisation or system achieve its str ategic go als. Bec ause it is all about encour aging more of this sort of beh aviour, the best recognition is th at which appeals to people's intrinsic and individu alised motiv ation. The most successful recognition schemes avoid a one-size-fits- all approach and are inste ad based on a deeper underst anding of wh at makes people do wh at they do. For ex ample, frequent person al expression of appreci ation is often more import ant to people th an financial reward. What the literature tells us Martins and Terbl anche (2003) describe how org anisational policies and pr actices such as rew ard systems reflect an org anisation's over all ethos and values, and help to legitimise and promote opportunities for innov ation. They note th at when cre ative beh aviour is rew arded, it shows th at it is v alued by the org anisation and a model of optim al behaviour thus emerges. Rewards do not necess arily need to be monet ary. Dombrowski and colle agues' (2007) rese arch suggested that monet ary incentives for innov ation are on the decline. Indeed, there is incre asing evidence th at perform ance rel ated p ay is not a prim ary driver, and might even act as a disincentive, for innov ation (Kerr 1995; Donkin 1998; D ay et. al., 2002; and Beugelsdijk 2008). One of the findings from a 2008 H arvard University colloquium of innov ation le aders and experts w as the observ ation th at \"asking questions about a project and providing even a word of sincere recognition c an be more motiv ating th an money\" (Am abile and Khaire, 2008). A Cabinet Office study (Mulg an and Albury, 2003) concluded th at \"additional monetary reward is less powerful as a motivator for innovation in the public sector; recognition, especially by peers, ismore effective\".RewardsCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 28Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 25Hornsby, Kur atko and Zahra (2002) reviewed a range of rese arch suggesting, among other things, th at rewards should cle arly tie to org anisational goals in order to effectively encour age collective activity. However, if le aders desire innov ation, rew ards cannot be only about achieving org anisational targets set by others extern al to the organisation. Rese arch conducted by Henley M anagement College (Higgs and Hender, 2004) confirmed previous findings th at creative m anagers are intrinsic ally motiv ated, where as anagers are ated by extrinsic f actors. Through her rese arch on cre ativity in high-tech firms in the US, Am abile (1998) identified the \"Intrinsic Motiv ation Principle of Creativity: people will be most cre ative when they feel motiv ated prim arily by the interest, s atisfaction, and ch allenge of the work itself\u2014 and not by extern al pressures.\" Kohn's (1990) extensive review of the liter ature c ame to a similar conclusion. Hornsby and colle agues (2002) highlight the import ance of intrinsic rew ards, which they consider to be prim arily orchestr ated by middle m anagers. These might include increased autonomy and opportunities for person al and profession al development th at support the innov ation process. The University of Birmingh am's He alth Services M anagement Centre (Willi ams, de Silv a and Ham, 2008) concluded th at innov ators in the NHS appreci ated both recognition and pr actical support for continuing their efforts (e.g., opportunities to t ake part in n ational and intern ational innov ation networks or visit ex amples of innov ation elsewhere). They also noted th at most NHS st aff have an intrinsic desire to be seen as \"on the leading edge of perform ance\" and suggested th at \"the NHS could do more to appeal to this desire\".CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 2926 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersExamples reflecting this dimension At BAE Systems, TheChairman's Award is given toteams who work with colleaguesor customers to come up with\"brand new thinking - asopposed to improvements onexisting ideas - which delivercost savings or other benefits tothe organisation\".

Im agining th at innov ation will h appen on its own if we just h ave the right culture would be as naive and irresponsible as imagining th at financial controls would n aturally emerge without some deliber ate structures. While everyone is capable of innov ative thinking, most of us h ave been soci alised to be more conserv ative in our thinking in the work environment, especi ally in he alth care where there are legitim ate risks th at must be m anaged. Le aders, therefore, need to consider how they build c apability and capacity in deliber ate methods for cre ative thinking. What the literature tells us The presence of deliber ate processes and tools w as identified as a critical success f actor in Smith and colle agues (2008) system atic review of the innov ation liter ature. Anthony, Johnson and Sinfield (2008) conducted in-depth interviews at more th an 40 org anisations across a range of priv ate-sector comp anies in the US, and then surveyed managers from over 100 org anisations across a variety of sectors in 14 countries reg arding their innov ation practices. They found th at successful org anisations h ave deliber ate structures and processes th at support innov ation, not le aving it to ch ance alone. 21/6/10 11:24 Page 32Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 29However, these processes must not be too rigid. In comp aring 14 longitudin al case studies across a variety of industries, V an de Ven and colle agues (1999) found th at while there were p atterns of common alities, the development of e ach innov ation w as a \"messy and complex progression of events\". The N ational School of Government's study of org anisations th at excel found th at that they h ad \"an emph asis on developing the capability and capacity to innov ate and take well-m anaged risks... [ and] a anism ch T anner and W alker, 2005). M adjar's (2005) review of the liter ature concluded th at \"formal training in cognitive abilities and formal brainstorming sessions is proven effective for increasing creativity\" although she went on to c aution th at training alone is insufficient. Bess ant and Maher (2009), reviewing rese arch on radical innov ation as part of a long-term intern ational progr amme, specific ally cite the import ance of tr aining on tools and methods from design science as import ant for the he alth service. The University of Birmingh am's He alth Services M anagement Centre's concluded th the NHS needs to \"support leaders and innov ators through tr aining and by cre ating sl ack\" (Willi ams, de Silv a and Ham, 2008). Simil arly, in a study conducted by the Cabinet Office Str ategy Unit, Mulg an and Albury (2003) found th at only h alf of all innov ations are initi ated at the top of org anisations and, therefore recommended th at public sector org anisations should invest in promoting tr aining and application of form al creativity techniques by front-line st aff. But development is not only about le arning specific tools and techniques for ide a gener ation. Plsek (1997) reviewed both the heuristic advice for incre asing person al creativity and the biogr aphies of successful innov ators and concluded th at experiences th at open one up to more flexibility in thinking are helpful. Along these lines, leaders and experts at a Harvard colloquium on innov ation recommended th at leaders \"encour age individu als to gain diverse experiences th at will incre ase their cre ativity\" (Am abile and Kh aire, 2008).CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 3330 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersExamples reflecting this dimension Cisco Systems has a focused anddisciplined approach toinnovation. Multiple teamssimultaneously work on findinginnovative approaches to aspecific issue, but as soon as oneteam has found a solution, workin all other teams ceases and theapproach is standardised anddiffused. Tesco use a \"hothousing\" approach for refining and testing innovative ideas. They define hothousing as \"triallingimprovements in a protected environment to allow risktaking that is necessary to create innovation\". Ideas are firststress-tested in 6 stores and further refined before beingrolled out to others. The process includes lots of staffinvolvement and purposeful tools such a root-cause analysis,process mapping, and plan-do-review cycles. Global agrichemical giantSyngenta AG has an internalLearning and Development Unitthat designs and executes trainingcourses that foster innovation andleadership among its 25,000employees. Scripps Newspapers has established a $1 million innovation fund.

Innov ative ide as are rarely the product of a lone genius. Even when they might appear to be, delving further into the story ne arly always reve als that the ide a was formed over time and through multiple inter actions with others th at fuelled the process. Therefore, environments where st aff are routinely exposed to a wide r ange of different thinking, from a wide-r ange of people, with a wide r ange of b ackgrounds and points of view, provide rich soil for the growth of innov ation. Of course, it is more th an just exposure; one c an be 'exposed' to a diverse group of people while riding on a train and not be stimul ated to innov ate. There must be a sense of common purpose; of being in a 'team' with others. This te am environment must also en able those with different thinking to trust th at their input will be honoured and explored, r ather th an immedi ately argued against. What the literature tells us Laboratory br ainstorming studies with university students suggest th at inter action with others incre ases an individu al's access to remote ment al associations and stimul ates divergent thinking (P aulus and Yang, 2000). While noting th at lone employees c an, of course, develop innov ations, Muthus amy, Wheeler and Simmons (2005) found th at teams of employees are more import ant in influencing the over all ability of an org anisation to innov ate. Reviewing dec ades of rese arch and experience, Bess ant (2003) notes: \"Studies of high performing organisations show th at they pl ace consider able emph asis on involvement in innov ation... moving away from specialists and tow ards higher levels of p articipation from others in the workforce.\" M adjar (2005) sums it up by citing sever al other sources and her own rese arch in st ating th at \"in contemporary organisations, creative ideas are more often the product of social interaction and influence than of periods ofthinking in isolation\"RelationshipsCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 36Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 33Based on their study of highly successful J apanese firms, Non aka and Takeuchi (1995) describe how the intern al diversity of the employees within an org anisation must m atch the v ariety and complexity of the environment in order to de al with the ch allenges posed. Kickul and Gundry's (2001) study of innov ation in e-commerce firms recognised a key component of innov ative actions to be \"the richness in bre adth of perspective m ade available to them by function ally diverse te am members\". A Cabinet Office study on innov ation concluded th at \"organisations whose st aff are diverse in terms of b ackgrounds and w ays of thinking - th at bring together strongly contr asting disciplin ary and profession al perspectives - are more likely to be innov ative\" (Mulg an and the import ance of f amiliarity and trust for the effective use of the diversity in te ams for innov ative problem solving. Zhou and George (2001) showed positive and signific ant relations between employee cre ativity and me asures of co-worker helping and support. Tjosvold and Yu's (2007) rese arch in Chinese org anisations found th at \"constructive controversy - where group members discuss their opposing views openly for mutu al benefit\" tended to promote more risk t aking behaviours, in turn encour aging innov ation and the ability to recover from mist akes. Reviewing studies of innov ative firms in Austr alia, Matthews (2002) noted th \"a differenti ating f actor of highly innov ative firms was their ability to cre ate a sense of community in the workpl ace with a family feeling, a sense of trust and caring... less innov ative units functioned more like tr adition al bure aucracies.\" Clegg and colle agues' (2002) study two aerosp ace firms found a signific ant correl ation between the degree of trust present in the environment and the number of ide as submitted and implemented. Chen, Chang and Hung (2008) further showed th at soci al inter action and networking ties in a trusting and open clim ate have a signific ant and positive imp act on the cre ativity of innov ation te ams.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 3734 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersExamples reflecting this dimension Google note that the ability toquickly form small teams torefine, pilot and implementideas is a critical componentin the success of its innovationprocess.

The wider the opening of the port al, the more innov ation flows through.2 The lines coming out from the centre correspond to e ach of the seven dimensions and provide a scale from - 5, through 0, to +5. \u0081A value of 0 indicates th at the beh aviours and pr actices corresponding to th at dimension neither aid nor hinder innov ation. \u0081Negative scores indic ate the presence of beh aviours and pr actices th at tend to hinder innov ation. \u0081Positive scores indic ate the presence of beh pr actices th at tend \u0081Larger positive or ative numbers indic ate more aid or hindr ance respectively. The scores are plotted on e ach sc ale and then connected with lines to cre ate a 'port al', as shown in the example opposite.A way to visualise the conditions for innovation: portal charts 2 Port al charts, like the one opposite, gr aphically illustr ate this concept. While port al charts are also referred to as spider di agrams bec ause they resemble a spider's web, we find the met aphor of a portal better suited to our needs here.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 42Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 39Assessing conditions for innovation: how to read a portal chart Here we see depicted a culture where there are strong go als for innov ation (+4), f airly strong innov ation (+2) and supportive rel ationships (+2). So f ar, it sounds good. The tools, processes and methods of the org anisation neither hinder nor aid innov ation (0), which m ay be OK, but is not very assertive for innov ation. Of even more concern, risk t aking is somewh at discour aged (-2) and lack of knowledge somewh at hinders innov ation (-2.5). We conclude, b ased on our seven dimensions fr amework, th at despite the strong go als and rew ards for innov ation, other f actors in the culture will limit innov ative output. To put it another w ay, the port al is not ex actly wide open for the free flow of ide as. The le aders of this org anisation or system cle arly have some work to do to create better conditions for innov ation. Stronger l anguage about go als and more rew ards will h ave only limited impact if risk t aking and knowledge sh aring are not also addressed.Risk Taking Resources Relationships Tools Rewards Goals-5 0 +5KnowledgeCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 43We can use the seven dimensions and a portal chart to help us think in advance about wh at we c an do to create the conditions for innov ation in a meeting, workshop, t ask group or any simil ar collection of individu als trying to be innov ative.3Application: Planning for innovation in an event, team or project 40 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersThe basic idea is this... If you w ant innov ative ide as from any collection of individu als, set aside the resource of time, nurture productive relationships among a diverse group of thinkers who will find the convers ation intrinsic ally rewarding , use good group process and tools , agree an ambitious goal, bring in new knowledge , and be willing to t ake risks . Using the dimensions in this w ay is a good w ay to g ain more f amiliarity with the concepts. A caution It is import ant to recognise th at simply cre ating a culture for innov ation within a small group (e.g. an improvement te am) or at a specific event (e.g. an away-day or improvement workshop) is only one p art of wh at is needed to bring about innov ation. The di agram illustr ates the commonly observed 'ide as to action problem'. The port al chart below depicts a wonderful culture for innov ation into which people are drawn out of their everyd ay setting and through which flow m any innov ative ide as.

The results of this can be displ ayed using a portal chart, helping le aders see where they might need to focus attention. A straightforw ard approach to assessing the culture for innov ation in an org anisation or system involves setting up a meeting of a represent ative cross-section of st aff and asking them to r ate each dimension. The sections below and in Appendix 2 provide guid ance and m aterials for doing this. Overview. Individu als representing a cross-section of the te am, dep artment, org anisation or system of interest are seated at tables of 6-8. After some initi al introduction to the purpose of the session, the f acilitator describes each of the seven dimensions. Groups of st aff at their respective t ables consider the dimensions and come to a consensus on a score for e ach one. E ach table then gives feedb ack on their scores to the l arger group, and these are compiled on a portal chart. This le ads to l arge group discussion about common alities and differences of opinion. Fin ally, the group, including the le aders, reviews the port al chart to agree areas needing attention and a prelimin ary list of action items to enh ance the culture for innov ation This might also be supplemented by further, off-line discussion to do a more in-depth analysis and identific ation of actions (see the tips in a later section of this guide). Proportional representation of the system. Where pr actical, strive to get represent atives from all the key service-delivery groups in the setting of interest, in roughly the proportion they represent. \u0081In an org anisation th at is 60% nurses, 15% doctors, 10% m anagers, and 15% admin st aff, seek to compose a group with roughly those proportions. \u0081If the te am, dep artment or org anisation is sm all, you might be able to do this in an all-staff session in which ne arly everyone c an take part. \u0081If you w ant to do this with just a very sm all group th at is not actually represent ative, explicitly discuss how all of the groups in the system might r ate each dimension. You might ask individu als to spe ak to represent atives of cert ain groups prior to the meeting to get their viewpoints. Obviously, this approach is subject to bi as, but it might be a good enough st art in order to get some obvious needs out in the open.Application: Informal assessment of the culture for innovation in an organisation or systemCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 48Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 45Group size and discussion group formation. We h ave tested this approach successfully with groups ranging from 10 to 150 people arranged in groups of six to ten for t able group discussion. We strongly suggest th at you form t ables of people from the s ame st akeholder or peer group. In other words, nurses sit with nurses, GPs with GPs, admin st aff with admin st aff, and so on. This arrangement assures th at all stakeholder groups' perceptions are captured in the initi al table group discussion. Differences in perceptions of the culture will then be highlighted when the t able groups feed b ack to the l arge group. For ex ample, a table of senior le aders might think th at the org anisation supports people to t ake sensible and appropri ate risks when considering new ide as, while a table of nursing st aff might not feel th at they would be supported and admit th at they would be very anxious about considering a new ide a. (As a further ex ample, see the box \"We don't see it in the s ame w ay\" on p age 62 in the Tips on Risk-T aking section.) Gener ating honest di alogue about such differences of perception is one of the keys to m aking things better. If senior le aders were dispersed on tables with front-line st aff origin ally, the senior le aders' view might domin ate the discussion precisely bec ause front-line st aff feel th at the culture would not support the risk of spe aking up! Time. For rich discussion, allow 1.5 to 2 hours. Facilitation. We strongly suggest using someone who is experienced in group f acilitation, perh aps a member of your service improvement te am or HR/development te am, to le ad the session (following a kick-off by a senior le ader). This might be a somewh at sensitive discussion as staff share their views on the culture of the organisation or system and it is best th at someone other th an the org anisational leader guides the di alogue to ensure th at everyone is comfort able and feels f airly he ard. Assessment process. Follow these simple steps: \u0081In prep aration for the meeting, photocopy bl ank port al charts, or cre ate these on flipch arts. Also consider photocopying the instructions sheets in Appendix 1. \u0081A leader (ide ally, the most senior person in the setting of interest) should kick-off the meeting, explaining in 5-10 minutes why innov ation is import ant to the org anisation or system, and noting that the culture is critic al in achieving it. He or she should st ate that the purpose of the meeting is to cre ate a greater underst anding about how all the different st aff groups in the room perceive the culture as either supporting or hindering innov ation. He or she should conclude with a sincere invit ation to honest and open di alogue. \u0081The facilitator should briefly (5-10 minutes) present the fr amework of the seven dimensions of innov ation culture and describe how st aff can provide a score using the port al charts. \u0081The inform al assessment process in t able groups c an then proceed using the m aterial in Appendix 2. \u0081The table in Appendix 2 th at guides the assessment could be copied and handed out, or the f acilitator can project this m aterial on slides. It works best if the whole group is guided through the assessment together, one dimension at a time, with the f acilitator re ading and expl aining e ach item. CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 4946 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide Leaders\u0081The initi al a two-step process: Individual: As the f acilitator talks through the dimensions individu als make their own assessment using their own copy of a portal chart (1-2 minutes per dimension) Group: Following the individu al assessments, the t able group sh ares responses and works together to come up with a consensus score for the t able for e ach dimension (10-15 minutes). Consensus in the table groups is typic ally easy to achieve, as staff in the s ame job c ategory tend to see the culture simil arly. \u0081This is followed by feedb ack reports from t able groups. (5-7 minutes) \u0081The e asiest approach is to work with one dimension at a time, with e ach table group reporting its score without comment. Continue through all seven dimensions, recording the r ange of scores in a large port al chart (see picture on the next p age). \u0081Next, explore e ach dimension further in a large-group discussion. Where there are differences in scores on a dimension, ask the v arious t ables to expl ain why they scored as they did. The point is to cre ate a deeper underst anding of the differences in perception (30-60 minutes). \u0081While it is not necess ary to come to a consensus, if a table group wishes to modify their r ating b ased on the discussion, this is fine. \u0081It is import ant to note th at, practically spe aking, when it comes to org anisational culture \"one's perception is re ality\". For ex ample, if nurses feel th at senior le aders do not support risk t aking, they are unlikely to t ake a risk expressing an innov ative ide a. Senior le aders c an take actions to ch ange this perception through different beh aviours, but simply dis agreeing during this assessment and saying th at they do support risk t aking is unlikely to be sufficient or helpful. The di alogue should be about genuinely listening and inquiring into others' views, r ather th an deb ate. \u0081The facilitator should t ake notes on a flip ch art pad, especi ally noting differences of perception. \u0081The meeting should conclude with a rich discussion of the mess age in the port al chart and identific ation of 1-3 dimensions th at are in most need of improvement. P articipants should be invited to offer suggestions about how these might be improved. This c an be achieved either in the t able groups, or as the whole group. The result should be a number of initi al action pl ans for improvement (15-30 minutes). \u0081A smaller group of le aders c an debrief following the meeting using the tips for improvement in this Guide to discuss further steps they c an take to enh ance the culture for innov ation.

This tool is free to NHS org anisations in Engl and and available to others for a charge. Overview of the assessment process. Someone from the org anisation or system t akes on the role of administr ator to cre ate an email invit ation list. This person also cre ates a list of relev ant demogr aphic identifiers that can be used l ater to look for p atterns in the responses. Staff invited to t ake part in the survey click on a link in the invit ation em ail that takes them to the survey. They provide demogr aphic inform ation (e.g., doctor, nurse, etc.) and then begin responding to the 29 items on the survey (see Appendix 3). There are four items associated with e ach dimension, plus an item th at asks for an overall assessment of the culture. Items come up r andomly on the survey and respondents r ate each on a 5- point sc ale: strongly dis agree, dis agree, neither agree nor dis agree, agree, or strongly agree. In our testing, it took st aff less th an 15 minutes to complete the survey. The results are plotted on a portal chart and a variety of b ar charts (see the c ase study on p ages 50/51). Results for individu al items allow for drill-down analysis using the demogr aphic inform ation collected at the beginning of the survey. For ex ample, le aders reviewing the results c an see if doctors, nurses and m anagers perceive the clim ate for risk t aking differently, or if the assessment v aries across dep artments in an org anisation or across org anisations in a system. These insights help le aders select from among the tips offered in the subsequent section of this guide the actions th at will h ave the gre atest imp act. Open and transparent communic ation of the results of the survey, and of actions th at have been, or will be, taken is essenti al.

Survey results. The survey w as sent to 200 st aff, and yielded 47 responses (24% response r ate). The figures are excerpts from the report gener ated by the survey tool. While North ampton h ad some of the highest scores among the trusts in the pilot, the survey still provided rich food for thought for le aders in this org anisation. Like ne arly all of the organisations in the pilot, North ampton scored high on go als and somewh at lower on resources for innov ation; reflecting the tr adition al NHS focus on t argets and limited resources. However, because culture is influenced loc ally, every organisation h as its own 'sign ature' and North ampton also had a relatively low score in the rew ards dimension.Risk Taking Resources Relationships RewardsTools Goals-5 0 +5KnowledgeFig 1: Northampton Portal ChartCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 54Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 51Dimension Risk T aking Risk T aking Risk T aking Risk T akingNo 1 432Statement My direct supervisor supports me if I w anted to try something new If I suggest a new ide a and it fails, I know th at I will feel so supported by everyone th at I will not be reluct ant to suggest even more ide as in future In my dep artment the gener al tendency is to hold on to thestatus quo r ather th an try new things Senior le adership is willing to take a risk on new ide as that might m ake things betterStrongly Dis agree Strongly Agree Neutr al 2.23 0.27 1.22 0.59-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3 4 5Fig 2: Northampton survey results exerptCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 5552 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 56Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 53The survey report structure also allows for 'digging deeper' by looking at the results for individu al items. For example, the report excerpt (see figure) shows the results for the four survey items in the risk t aking dimension. Here we see th at staff feel supported by their direct supervisor to try new things, but they are not as sure about senior le adership. This p attern of feeling more sure about their direct supervisor th an about senior le aders w as repeated in other dimensions (see Appendix 3 and note th at the fourth item in e ach dimension focuses on senior le aders). Further, while st aff feel supported to t ake a risk on a new ide a, they are not so sure how supported they would be if the ide a failed. There were m any simil ar insights found in the d ata from the other dimensions. Leadership reflection. These results were fed b ack to the Hospit al Management Group (Director level) who noted th at recent senior le adership ch anges h ad likely imp acted on the perceptions of st aff. Simply put, st aff didn't know senior le aders as well as they knew their direct supervisors. More effort w as needed to communic ate messages about the desir ability of innov ation. (The le aders also suggested th at the term 'senior le aders' might need to be cl arified, and the survey and supporting m aterials have since been amended to incorpor ate this suggestion.) The m anagement group recognised the need to do more in the resources and rew ards dimensions, while building on the strength in the go als dimension. Actions. They decided to link action on the results of the survey to promoting new w ays of working and the gener ation of innov ative ide as. Specific ally, leaders are now working to help st aff think about innov ation and, where appropri ate, link into the bidding process for the region al innov ation funds from the SHA. This process has already yielded a two successful bids. More communic ation across the org anisation to spre ad the word is pl anned; including an innov ation forum, which will provide a focus on telling the story so f ar and describing pl ans for the future. The forum will also include stories of innov ative ide as that have been supported intern ally without the need for funding and those that have been successful in attracting extern al funding. In addition, the trust will run a series of cre ativity workshops, e ach focused on a particular challenge or loc al issue so th at the people who attend them h ave a definite go al in mind. The objective is to cl arify the process - and communic ate senior le aders' support for it - thereby encour aging more ide as to come forw ard. Another issue identified in the survey w as that staff didn't always feel recognised for their efforts. The organisation h as started to introduce new mech anisms to improve this. Ex amples include helping st aff write up their work to publish articles, and providing support for st aff to work differently. Reflecting on the experience, Director of Service Improvement Sue St anley s aid, \"The survey gave us useful insights into people's views of innovation. We plan to repeat it and run it more broadly across the organisationto see how those perceptions have changed once the changes we are making have had an opportunity tobe implemented.\"CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:24 Page 57Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (LPFT) Setting.

While the le aders were disappointed in the low response r ate, the mess ages from this survey were consistent with those from otherstaff surveys with higher response r ates and feedb ack from existing org anisational development (OD) efforts. (The m aterials for setting up the survey and inviting participants h ave been amended to stress the import ance of actions th at lea ders c an take to ensure higher response r ates.)

The trust's chief executive and workforce development te am cre ated a roadshow for all staff in the Trust's 72 delivery loc ations c alled \"Pursuing even gre ater effectiveness together\". In these sessions, the chief executive communic ated the import ance of innov ation, especi ally in the current h arsh economic environment, by saying, \"We need to unle ash your ide as.

You will almost always think better in a group with others who, like you, w ant to stimul ate more innov ation. But, if you are working with others, remember th at the seven dimensions apply to this sm all group as well (see previous section, Applic ation: Pl anning for innov ation in an event, te am or project, p age 40). If you cre ate the conditions for innov ation in your meeting you will be more likely to get innov ative ide as about how to cre ate the culture for innov ation in your setting. 1. Review the results of the whole assessment. Look both at the dimensions for which you h ave a positive score and those th at require improvement. T alk about wh at you believe h as been done in the p ast that has led to the strengths indic ated by the positive scores and think about wh at you c an do to sust ain those dimensions. Also reflect on any work th at has been undert aken in the p ast in those areas that have received less positive scores. Fin ally, discuss wh at learning you c an take from all this about cre ating a supporting culture. 2. Review each of the dimensions you now want to focus on as a result of the assessment process. A one-p aragraph synopsis is provided at the beginning of e ach section of tips, or you c an go b ack to the earlier section of this guide for a more complete review of the evidence along with a list of key constructs in the he ader. Decide whether you need to work on a dimension over all, or just some specific aspects of it. Having a clear idea about the specific areas you most need to work on before re ading the tips will help you stay focused on wh at will re ally make a difference. Avoid being distr acted by a tip th at looks interesting, but in fact isn't wh at you most need to do to m ake a real difference. 3. Read all the tips associated with your dimensions of focus to see the range of things that you might try. Think these through thoroughly: \u0081What is the b asic ide a behind this tip? \u0081How do we think it would work in our context? \u0081How might we adapt it to fit? \u0081How might we combine thoughts from sever al tips in cr afting something unique for our situ ation? \u0081What addition al ideas do we h ave beyond the ones here? \u0081How will we actually implement something? \u0081Who will we need to work with to do this?

Use a disciplined, reflective learning approach - for example, a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle - to test your intervention. When trying to bring about ch ange in soci al systems such as organisations, you never know wh at might work until you try it out. \u0081Plan and undert ake a small test of ch ange. For ex ample, try something out in one area, with one te am or one dep artment, or for just one week. \u0081Seek feedb ack on whether it h as made a difference to the view of your st aff. Consider using 1 or 2 specific questions from the survey in Appendix 3 as an easy, rapid follow up me asure. \u0081For ex ample, after trying something new for a week in a department, pl ace one question from the survey on a notice board and ask staff to pl ace a mark or dot under their response to th at item (strongly dis agree, dis agree, neither agree nor dis agree, agree, or strongly agree). Compare this to a simil ar poll t aken before the intervention, or to the previous results if you used the survey for assessment. Altern ately, just ask people to discuss how they feel about the intervention. \u0081Reflect on the le arning, modify the intervention as required and test again, m aybe on a larger sc ale, in order to spre ad the ch ange.

While it is obviously import ant to avoid t aking in appropri ate risk, a healthy org anisational culture seeks a balanced assessment th at avoids prem aturely rejecting ide as due to over-estim ation of risk. It also requires le aders who show they are quick to provide emotion al support to those willing to try something new, reg ardless of whether the ide a is eventu ally judged a success or 'f ailure'. Le aders in innov ative org anisations demonstr ate that they are more interested in le arning from f ailure th an in punishing it.Tips for Improving the Risk Taking Dimension Emotional support / Balanced assessment / Learnin g from failure rather than punishin g / Tryin g new thin gs Capitalising on 'failure' When developing the Airbl ade, the energy-efficient h and drier for public restrooms, the engineers at Dyson, noticed th at the m achine w as trapping a lot of air inside and bec ame curious about this 'f ailure' of their design. They wondered wh at they could do with this high-speed air.

They h ad found an opportunity.... and the bl adeless f an has been cre ated. Share widely how the organisation or system has taken reasonable risks on innovative ideas in the past. If staff don't see le aders actively supporting re asonable risk t aking, they m ay get the impression that it isn't supported.

The three groups s at on sep arate tables for the initi al discussions. When e ach group reported out on the risk t aking dimension, it bec ame evident th at there w as a large difference of opinion among them. The senior le aders who h ad rated the org anisation highly on risk t aking were genuinely surprised th at the managers and front-line st aff had rated it lower. \"We h ave long deb ates about things at board meetings, and these often result in our support of innov ative pilots of ide as that have not been tried anywhere else before\". But a member of front-line st aff asked how she would ever know about these discussions. \"You h ave to underst and it from our position in the org anisation\", she s aid, \"the first we he ar of new w ays of working is after they h ave been fully tested and are being spre ad more widely. At th at point, it doesn't seem like much of a risk to us; but more like a top-down, m anagement-controlled culture. It cert ainly doesn't suggest to me th at my te am would be welcomed to try something new and innov ative. And we almost never he ar about ide as that were piloted but did not work, even though th at learning might h ave been useful to us\". The le aders took her point and resolved th at they needed to do a great deal more communic ation about all the reasonable risk t aking and learning th at they perceived w as already going on in the org anisation, and how they welcomed more of it. 62 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 66Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 63If the issue in your setting is about a difference in perception, the solutions are simple. For ex ample: \u0081Be transparent about how risk is embr aced and assessed in the org anisation. Consider how you can keep st aff informed about this. \u0081Publicise new ide as that are being tested, outline the anticip ated benefits and risks, and describe the roles of senior le aders in supporting these. \u0081Talk about h ard decisions at the bo ard to support innov ative pilots and new w ays of working. Be seen spe aking openly about these before you are sure th at they work. \u0081Don't be afraid to be quoted s aying things like, \"It's never re ally been done like this before, and we know th at it might not turn out ex actly as planned, but we're willing to give it a go on a trial basis, with good monitoring and contingency pl ans, and we support those who w ant to le arn about the process.\" \u0081Get front-line st aff involved in pl anning pilot efforts, and ask them to sh are with colle agues their experience of being supported in prudent risk t aking.Tips for Improving the Risk Taking Dimension Emotional support / Balanced assessment / Learnin g from failure rather than punishin g / Tryin g new thin gs \"Often, the difference between a successful person and a failure is not one has better abilities or ideas, but the courage that one has tobet on one's ideas, to take a calculated risk - and to act.\" Andre M alrauxCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 67Establish a process to publicise and learn from ideas that 'fail'.

Every attempt at innov ation should h ave some form of an After Action Review (see box below), but this is even more import ant with 'f ailures'.

Leaders who underst and and recognise the potenti al in st aff make it their business to know and person ally connect with individu als and teams who are doing innov ative things. Go out to the person's work area, or to the dep artment or te am, and take an interest. Show th at you know wh at they are doing, ask wh at they are learning (reinforcing the principle \"the only f ailure is f ailure to le arn\"), and ask wh at you c an do to help. 66 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersThink of the difference in emotion al impact on a more junior member of st aff between h aving a senior le ader seek her or him out to see how things are going, versus the anxiety th at might be associated with being asked to come give a form al report to the bo ard. Be system atic as a leadership te am about this and keep the lines of communic ations open. Assign le aders to be 'supporters' or 'sponsors' of specific innov ations. Schedule periodic w alk-arounds or phone c alls to keep the lines of communic ations open. These supportive beh aviours will also help you cre ate the clim ate for innov ation in the Resources and the Rewards dimensions. They give you the opportunity to reinforce the authority to act, identify any resource constr aints th at might be blocking progress, and provide recognition and appreci ation. \"Management's job is not to prevent risk but to build the capacity to recover when failures occur... if we aren't always at least alittle scared, we're not doing our job\" Ed Catmull, cofounder of Pix ar and president of Pix ar and Disney Anim ation StudiosCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 70Creating the Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 67Reverse the negative, worst-case scenario culture by establishing new conversation practices when innovative ideas are presented. Most org anisations do not do a balanced assessment of risks when evaluating a new ide a against the st atus quo. When presented with a new ide a, people c an be quick to point out wh at might go wrong, ask for strong evidence to support the new ide a, or note th at it would not work under cert ain circumst ances. This almost immedi ately kills the enthusi asm for the new ide a and m akes the individu al who r aised it feel defl ated. Take the le ad in reversing this beh aviour and mindset by acting differently and encour aging others to do the same. For ex ample, when presented with new ide as: \u0081Create a rule th at the benefits of the ide a are listed first before any discussion about wh at could go wrong. (This is a principle behind Edw ard de Bono's Six Thinking H ats\u00ae; see the NHS Institute's public ation Thinking Differently for more inform ation.) \u0081Recognise th at the new ide a may not work for every p atient group or situ ation. However, ensure th at any decision is m ade on the benefits for the m ajority r ather th an not using the ide a because it does not benefit everyone in every situ ation. \u0081Review critic ally the current process th at the ide a relates to. Ask for the evidence th at supports the st atus quo approach. Ask th at the new ide a be judged f airly to the s ame st andard of evidence th at we allow for the st atus quo pr actice. When ex amined more closely vi a this ch allenge, te ams often find th at the new ide a can offer benefits th at the current process does not. \u0081Rather th an dismissing an ide a as imperfect, ch allenge others to think about how they might further develop it to address its we akness. (See the Enh ancement Checklist in the NHS Institute's public ation Thinking Differently for more inform ation.) Research indic ates th at the beh aviours of form al organisational leaders h ave a disproportion ately large effect on org anisational culture (Schein 2004). Commissioners, SHAs and Chief Executives in an area can have the same effect on the culture of a health economy. If a leader st arts responding differently upon he aring new ideas, others are likely to follow.

Consider exposing yourself a bit by frequently asking others for feedb ack on your own beh aviour and the culture of the org anisation. You might use a version of any of the questions on the culture for innov ation survey (see Appendix 3) as a guide. For ex ample, you might ask staff during a walk-around \"If you suggest a new ide a and it f ails, do you think th at would m ake you reluct ant to suggest even more ide as in future?\" Appe al for an honest response, an expl anation as to why they feel as they do, and suggestions for wh at they would like to see th at is different. Make a point of sh aring the impressions you get from doing this with everyone, even if they are somewh at person ally emb arrassing for you. Experience indic ates th at people often give credit to a leader who is person ally sincere and cle arly trying to m ake things better. Don't use humour to lighten the mood when discussing the risks associated with an innovative idea. It almost never works and often has the opposite effect. The box below describes all-too-often- heard comments me ant to be light-he arted in approaching the risk t aking associated with innov ation. Some things are just not funny We cringe at some of things th at we h ave actually he ard senior le aders s ay... \"Jane tells us she is sure it will work, and we've told her we are sure she c an find work elsewhere if it doesn't (ha ha ha)\". \"Yes, I c an remember we le arned a lot from a past failure of an innov ative ide a.

This affirms th at they believe th at this g allows humour is actually true about the org anisation. 68 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersDon't do this! If you are in a room where someone does, immedi ately spe ak up and say something in a serious tone like, \"Actu ally, Jane's confidence in le ading the w ay on this innov ative ide a is just ex actly the sort of thing we support around here, and we cert ainly wouldn't w ant people like her to le ave\".

The clim ate for innov ation is enh anced if people know th at they h ave the 'resource' of authority and autonomy to act on innov ative ide as. While innov ative ide as do not necess arily need a lot of money or time to develop, st aff can become demor alised if these tr adition al resources are not available and can feel th at there is no point in putting forw ard a new ide a. The presence of concrete resources sign al that the org anisation is t aking innov ation seriously. Reinforce the expectation that individuals and teams should feel they have authority to act on innovative ideas and seek to understand why they might feel they do not. Do you know the re asons that staff might not feel able to act on new ide as? Many leaders don't, nor do they know the process, assuming th at one exists, th at staff have to go through in order to g ain permission to try something new. Do a 'spot check' during individu al meetings or w alk-arounds by asking st aff to tell you about ide as they h ave where they feel they need more permission to act. Ask them about the process they believe they need to go through to get this permission. In our experience, we h ave found ex amples where st aff are required to go through a long and complic ated process, or they h ave no ide a what the process is. Be cle ar that you are very open to feedb ack and truly w ant to h ave an honest di alogue about any past 'sign als' that might h ave been sent by le aders. Also m ake it cle ar that it may indeed be th at, in some circumst ances, they do need permission. In any case, both you and they will le arn more about how to t ake innov ative ide as forw ard. In the end, the goal is to remove misconceptions and perceived barriers. Be prepared to do something and communicate back tostaff to raise their feeling of empowerment. In doing this, re alise th at the very act of coming forw ard with innov ative ide as represents some level of risk- taking. Consistent with th at dimension, be c areful to provide emotion al support and show genuine appreci ation of their efforts and any difficulties they f ace. The advice here, while fr amed above in the context of an org anisation, also applies to commissioners who might st art a similar dialogue asking the org anisations they work with if they feel th at they need permission to be innov ative, and why. Commissioners need to work with providers to decre ase the perceived b arriers to innov ation, which might involve altering such commissioning levers as payment and tariff schemes.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 7572 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersCaution: Something to think honestly about. This tip m ay require some honest, self-reflection in a leadership team. The premise of the suggestion is th at leaders will w ant members of st aff to feel th at they h ave the authority to try out innov ative ide as. But this might not actually be the c ase. Le aders v ary gre atly in their need to feel th at they are in control of things, and in wh at they would cl assify as being 'too risky'. It is import ant to explore this and gain consensus in your le adership te am before telling st aff that they h ave authority to act on their innov ative ideas. You m ay do h arm in the long run if you tell st aff that they are empowered, but then h ave a leader who takes it all back by her or his actions. Turn strategically important innovation efforts into formal organisational projects with allocated resources . The most obvious w ay to provide resources for innov ation is to focus innov ative thinking on areas where resources already exist, or where there is a strong str ategic imper ative and resources could be identified. This might occur in one of two w ays: a) Select existing priority go als and ask staff specific ally for innov ative ide as in these areas. For ex ample if you already have teams who are focusing on s afety, ch allenge them to m assively over achieve their own aspirations by thinking differently about this area. This request might be initi ated by commissioners, boards, or dep artment al and te am leaders. The key is to recognise th at staff are an import ant resource and often h ave ide as from their experience of delivering services. While it is an example of top-down, directed innov ation, there is nothing wrong with this. The presence of resources and the cle ar call for innov ation sign al to st aff that there is an uncommon willingness on the p art of le aders to he ar about and provide resources for innov ative ide as on this p articular topic, and th at can be quite motiv ating. b)Consider whether an idea suggested by someone in the org anisation or system is so powerful in terms of its potenti al impact on qu ality, p atient experience, productivity, costs, or prevention th at it deserves to be r aised to the level of a strategically import ant project in the next pl anning cycle.

In a context of limited resources, it m ay be necess ary to cre ate he ad room for innov ation by first emb arking on productivity improvement and then allocating some of the s avings to support innov ative new ide as. Leaders c an sign al their strong support for innov ation, and perh aps incre ase staff buy-in to needed ch anges in other areas, by explicitly ring-fencing some of the s avings th at come from w aste reduction efforts (e.g., qu ality improvement methods and progr ammes such as lean thinking, see the NHS Institute's Productive Series) in order to fund innov ative new ide as. For ex ample, commissioners might m ake funding of an innov ative pilot contingent on s avings elsewhere - or, org anisational leaders might ret ain some he adcount from a service redesign effort th at reduces the number of st aff needed in one area in order to re-direct the newly freed up st aff onto innov ation projects. Creative productivity enhancements byhospital staff enable development ofinnovative new services in the community It is import ant to acknowledge the contributions of st aff in both the w aste-reduction efforts and the innov ation efforts. Remind everyone th at the innov ation work would not h ave been possible without the h ard work of those involved in the productivity improvement efforts th at freed up the required resources. This also provides a great opportunity to build a sense of te amwork across an org anisation or system. CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 77Seek resources from non-traditional channels. Existing budgets and projects should not be the only channel of resources you consider. 'Think outside the box' a bit and you m ay find th at there are more resources for innov ation th at you could access. Also exp and your thinking about resources beyond the monet ary to include people and expertise (see box below). Finding resources to help you innovate... \u0081 Become a test site for n ational initiatives, as these sometimes h ave addition al resources in terms of expert help or sm all amounts of funding attached to them. \u0081Contact your SHA about 'innov ation funds', for which you c an bid. \u0081 You m ay be able to secure funds from volunt ary sector org anisations, or even the N ational Lottery. \u0081L o c al industries might be willing to volunteer their time and skills to help with innov ative efforts. For ex ample, in work done at the NHS Institute, hospit al porters were supported by N ationwide Building Society, Orec al, IDEO ( a leading design firm), Tesco, and Roy al Mail to cre ate new ide as about how they could provide a better customer service. \u0081Contact university professors to see if you c an arrange a mutu ally benefici al scheme where students provide support for innov ation projects (e.g., designing websites, collecting or analysing d ata or undert aking specific communic ations exercises) th at also provides them pr actical work experience to go along with their course of study. Sever al NHS org anisations h ave benefited from students of journ alism and photogr aphy who h ave provided their time for free and used the work they h ave done as part of their academic assessment. \u0081 Members of the community including p atients and their f amilies might also be willing to volunteer their time and skills; either in lending a true service users' perspective to innov ation projects, or in helping complete needed t asks (e.g., designing a communic ation brochure).

Since we c annot know in advance wh at knowledge might stimul ate an innov ative ide a, censoring, filtering or over-summ arising inform ation detr acts from this dimension. Start a 'Not Invented Here' programme where leaders, managers, and staff are supported to seek out knowledge and ideas from outside health care that can be adapted to address keyorganisational challenges. Each of us h ave sever al encounters a week with people, businesses and services where we experience good flow as customers, h ave inter actions th at create exception al positive experience, or see high levels of productivity vi a technology or job design. The simple f act is th at most of us simply do not think about how the principles of successful oper ations in these other services might be applied to the work we do ourselves. Capitalise on the myri ad experiences of st aff (and even their friends, p artners and families!) by dr awing attention to the need to apply ideas and principles from elsewhere to the work we do. (For more on the thinking behind this tip, see the ment al valleys concept and the Fresh Eyes and Ment al Benchm arking tools described in the NHS Institute's public ation Thinking Differently which c an be obt ained from www.institute.nhs.uk/thinkingdifferently) This month, we are seeking ideas that we could adaptfrom elsewhere that will allow service users to gaingreater access to services out of normal hours. While gener al awareness r aising is useful, a more focused effort will h ave even gre ater benefits. For example: In addition to supporting the Knowledge dimension, this sets a goal, implies th at there is little risk in suggesting an idea as these are welcomed, suggests th at resources will be available to support some work, and provides an opportunity to recognise those who contribute.

Linking these to str ategic priorities and being able to articulate a clear, multi- faceted c ase of need, further sign als the import ance of the c all for innov ation. However there is a caution. Innov ative thinking is stifled when le aders go beyond st atements of wh at needs to be achieved and also become prescriptive as to how it must be achieved. Identify and publicise widely the strategic issues where there is a clear case for the need for innovation and where extension of the current way of working is clearly inadequate to meet theneed. While continu al, increment al improvement is the ethos of the he alth system, this c an also le ad to a culture of compl acency. The mindset \"of course we c an always do a bit better\", while good, le ads to ch ange that often does not fund ament ally ch allenge the st atus quo approach. In other words, it is not re ally very innov ative and does not achieve bre akthrough results. At the s ame time, ch allenging and ch anging everything at once is a recipe for ch aos. Somewhere in between the two extremes lies gre at opportunity for str ategically focused innov ation. Identifying those opportunities and attaching a stretch go al that captures the im agination c an stimul ate lots of innov ative thinking. Stretch Goals and Innovation. The cl assic ex ample from NASA (the US sp ace progr am) w as President Kennedy's ch allenge in 1963 th at \"we will put a man on the moon and bring him home s afely by the end of the decade\". At the time, few of the technologies required were available and there were m any un answered questions. But this cle arly articulated stretch t arget spurred m assive innov ation in sever al fields th at not only benefited the sp ace effort but also led to products th at we take for gr anted tod ay (for ex ample, both c ardiac pacemakers and he alth care telemetry h ad their origins in NASA innov ations). CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 8986 Creating for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersThe key in articulating t argets th at stimul ate innov ation is to stick strictly to defining the 'wh at' and the 'why', but ste adfastly avoid specifying the 'how'. The aim is actually to h ave people initi ally re act saying th at it c annot be done. This then provides the opportunity to le ad them to re alise th at what is holding them b ack is the w ay that they are thinking about it. (This is a principle behind the Th at's Impossible! tool in the NHS Institute's public ation Thinking Differently which c an be obtained from www.institute.nhs.uk/thinkingdifferently.) An ex ample of cle ar statements of 'wh at' and 'why' linked to a strategic go al is provided in the box below. The cl arity of the go al, the strength of the c ase, and the size of g ap invites people to think differently about approaches to the problem. For ex ample, ide as about innov ative p artnerships with others in the he alth service, as well as organisations in other sectors or individu als in the community, come inst antly to mind. Setting Goals that Encourage Innovation in the Health Service Key Principle: Clearly articulating the 'wh at' and Situation: 40% of unpl anned admissions to our Acute Trust are alcohol rel ated, and the percent age is rising at an alarming r ate. Data also indic ates th at alcohol pl ays a role in m any cases of st aff abuse by p atients. We h ave identified reduction of alcohol-rel ated unpl anned admissions as one of our str ategic priorities. What (stretch goal): We w ant to go beyond simply slowing the growth in alcohol-rel ated admissions. How might we cut the actual number of unpl anned alcohol-rel ated admissions in h alf in 2 ye ars? Why (the case): We h ave made increment al improvements, but these are merely slowing the r ate of incre ase. The absolute numbers of alcohol-rel ated admissions already place an unsust ainable burden on us from a finance, staff safety, and staff mor ale perspective. The rising burden of unpl anned alcohol-rel ated admissions will only grow more intoler able as we enter a period where resources will be further constr ained. We must do something radically different now. CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 90Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 87Tips for Improving the Goals Dimension What, but not how / Specific call for innovation / Tie to strate gic plan / 'Stretch' / Clear case for need Set out organisation- or system-wide innovation challenge topics that call for innovative ideas in specific areas of need. This str aightforw ard approach builds on the previous tip but goes a step further to create an 'innov ation focus list'. In the spirit of focusing, this list should be specific as to topics and no more than five to seven items. For ex ample: \u0081A Found ation Trust might s ay, \"We need truly innov ative ide as in the areas of: elimin ating w aiting, reducing stillbirths in a certain ethnic group, truly equipping and empowering p atients and carers in their own disch etc.\" \u0081Commissioners in w ant innov ations th at will: cut teen age pregn ancies by 70%, reduce admissions for people with di abetes by 50%, etc.\" The specificity of the go als and targets implies attention and resource- availability. Going further, le aders could set up specific structures and processes to enh ance the invit ation to innov ation; for ex ample, identifying a specific senior executive as the sponsor for e ach item on the list, or setting up a webp age or em ail box th at will accept ide as and respond b ack to the initi ator. \"Many people fail in life, not for lack of ability or brains or even courage but simply because they have never organized theirenergies around a goal.\" Elbert Hubb ard Innov 1880.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 11:25 Page 9188 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersArticulate stretch goals in the language of \"how might we... (do something that today seems impossible)?\" In many org anisations, the word 't arget' or 'go al' implies th at there will be neg ative consequences associated with not meeting it, even if one f alls short by only a small amount. The n atural reaction is to w ant to avoid setting oneself up for neg ative consequences. The best w ay to do so is to deb ate the specifics of the go al. Often, more thinking energy is devoted to arguing against the specific t arget th an is given to coming up with innov ative ide as. A simple w ay to avoid this is to st ate innov ation go als and targets in the form of a question th at begins: \"How might we...?\" (see box). This invites enquiry and cre ativity, r ather th an resist ance and deb ate. It also sign als that you h ave simply chosen a round number to shock the thinking and you don't re ally me an anything more exact than that. In the end, if we achieve a 43% reduction in something th at we set a goal of 50% on th at is still something worth celebr ating! How might we... \u0081 We h ave reached our 18 weeks w ait targets, how might we reduce th at by h alf again? \u0081 Our oper ating costs in the atre are much better now, but how might we cut them an addition al 30%? \u0081Many people with di abetes in our pr actice h ave achieved control of their blood sug ar levels. How might we m aintain that outcome with h alf the number of visits to he alth profession als? \u0081 How might we achieve a 25% reduction in f alls across the whole community? Review current goals and targets and seek to remove overly-prescriptive means that are embedded within them, or make it clear that you are very open to alternative means that accomplish the samegoal. For ex ample, a target to \"Reduce by 10% unpl anned admissions of people with di abetes by implementing the XYZ model of c are\" le aves only a little sp ace for innov ative thinking. Of course, if there is good evidence for the XYZ model of c are and others h ave routinely achieved s atisfactory results with it, then this is perfectly good go al statement for the spre ad of an innov ative pr actice th at will le ad to improvement. This is a good thing (For more about this distinction, see the expl anation at the end of the Introduction section and the first tip in the Tools section.) but le aders c an enh ance the conditions for further innov ation by s aying instead... \"The go al is to reduce by 10% unpl anned admissions of people with di abetes. The XYZ c are model has been shown effective in achieving this, and we might indeed decide to implement it here. But before we take that decidion, let's also consider other approaches. How might we achieve a 10% reduction in unpl anned admissions for people with di abetes?\" CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 11:25 Page 92Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 89Tips for Improving the Goals Dimension What, but not how / Specific call for innovation / Tie to strate gic plan / 'Stretch' / Clear case for need CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 9390 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersSuch thinking might result in an even better approach, or some innov ative building on the proposed c are model. Further, even if clinic al leaders and front-line st aff decide after thinking about it th at the XYZ c are model is actually a good approach, the difference between le aders telling them they must do it versus le aders inviting them to input and chose for themselves will likely h ave a positive imp act on e ase of implement ation and eventu al sustainability. Consider goals, contracts, annual appraisals, personal development plans, or job descriptions that require people to try out a number of innovative ideas annually and report back on what they havelearned. A basic principle behind m any of the tips in this section is to s ay what is expected in a high-level sense, and avoid over-specifying the det ails. Building on th at, this tip suggests simply setting the gener al goal of asking for innov ation of any kind. How do you define an 'innovative idea'? The comp anion guide in this series, M aking a Bigger Difference, provides an approach. However, the aim of this go al is not to accumul ate or judge ide as, but r ather to stimul ate thinking and cre ate a convers ation th at encour ages even more innov ation. Le aders will le arn something about the capability for innov ation in their org anisations by h aving this convers ation and reflecting on the items th at are put forw ard as examples of innov ation. Likewise, commissioners will le arn something about the innov ativeness of providers in their he alth community. If you are truly cre ating the conditions for a difference, you should see a difference in the depth of ch allenge to st atus quo thinking over time.

One of the purposes in setting go als for innov ation is to communic ate the need for innov ative thinking. There is a timeless principle communic ate it properly\". The objective is to see whether you are communic ating cle arly enough to r aise people's awareness of the need for innov ation so th at they are const antly on the look out for innov ative ide as. If they cite b ack to you the areas where you h ave set go als for innov ation, then you h ave evidence of good communic ation. If they say they don't know if innov ation is re ally needed, or they cite completely different areas, then you h ave evidence th at the innov ation go als you h ave set are not necess arily accomplishing the objective of stimul ating innov ative thinking. You m ay need to communic ate again, or do it better. Or, you m ay have targeted areas that simply do not seem th at import ant to others. In any event, you are not fully c apitalising on the power of goals to cre ate a culture for innov ation.

They sign al how much v alue is given, or not, to the efforts of individu als and te ams who come up with new ways to help the org anisation or system achieve its str ategic go als. Bec ause it is all about encour aging more of this sort of beh aviour, the best recognition is th at which appeals to people's intrinsic and individu alised motiv ation. The most successful recognition schemes avoid a one-size-fits- all approach and are inste ad based on a deeper underst anding of wh at makes people do wh at they do. For ex ample, frequent person al expression of appreci ation is often more import ant to people th an financial reward. Keep it simple and sincere. Recognition c an come in m any forms; the more direct, str aightforw ard and heartfelt, the better. A simple 'th ank you', delivered person ally in the st aff member's or te am's environment, along with a description of the ide a in your own words th at shows th at you re ally took the time to underst and what they are suggesting, goes a long w ay. Taking the time to expl ain wh at will be done with the ide a, or wh at you w ant them to do with it next, is another simple thing to do. If the ide a cannot be t aken up, providing a thoughtful expl anation as to why tells them th at the ide a was given consider ation, while also providing some coaching as to how to come up with an even more useful ide a next time around. Be genuine and sincere in your efforts to recognise st aff ideas. They c an detect if you are simply going through the motions and don't seem to re ally me an it when you s ay that you appreci ate their efforts. It would be better to s ay nothing at all than to s ay something th at comes across as insincere. Seek to understand and work with what intrinsically motivates innovators. While \"it's the thought th at counts\" does indeed count for something, st andardised awards m ay leave the receiver feeling theirs h as been a superfici al rather th an signific ant accomplishment in the eyes of the org anisation. In order to stimul ate more innov ation, we need more people who feel a deep bond of appreci ation from their org anisation. \"[If] rewards don't follow suit, then the lasting innovation culture you seek will be fleeting at best .\" Troy Geesm an Innov ation and Str ategy Director at the design firm l agaCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 97This tip simply suggests th at while, as a practical matter, you might ask a small group to come up with ide as for recognition of innov ation, th at group needs first to go out and talk with lots of people who might be the potenti al recipients of such recognition. It also suggests th at you m ay need an array of w ays to recognise accomplishments and a way to m atch these to an underst anding of wh at is me aningful to e ach individu al you wish to recognise. When we think of 'rew ards', monet ary prizes often come to mind first. While few people would refuse to accept a monet ary rew ard, there is a great body of evidence to indic ate that the v ast majority of people do not do wh at they do in order only to get more money (Kohn 1990). R ather, there are many other intrinsic motiv ators; th at is, factors intern al to a person and having to do with their v alues and perspectives (see box). What motivates you? \u0081M any front-line st aff feel th at monet ary rew ards for ide as should be directed at purch asing equipment or further enh ancing the service bec ause their person al values are deeply centred on c aring for p atients. \u0081A s t aff nurse who developed a new needle dispos al system w as delighted to h ave help in writing an article for public ation in a profession al journ al.

Their experience w as so good they could not stop t alking about it and the new ide as they h ad learned. Many have enquired if this recognition is available for others.3M's HR Policy Stimulates Innovation By Giving Innovators What They Really Want... Studies of innov ators across a variety of sectors indic ate that what many would like most is more time to work on innov ations bec ause they person ally value the excitement and ch allenge of trying to do something different. Underst anding this intrinsic motiv ator, the industri al firm 3M h as a hum an resources policy th at allows all staff to take up to 15% of their time on the job to work on innov ative ide as, and then provides even more allowance of time for the most promising ide as. 94 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 98Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 95To gain others' intrinsic motiv ation, initi ate convers ations as you w alk about or inter act with sm all groups. Use open-ended discussion st arters such as: \u0081What was the best recognition you ever h ad in a work situ ation? \u0081What could we do to m ake you feel recognised and supported in the work you h ave done? \u0081What motiv ated you choose to work in the he alth care sector versus others? Talk to lots of people. Listen appreci atively. While you will no doubt he ar diversity in the responses, you will also begin to see p atterns. Use these insights as input to the design of any recognition effort. Set up structures and processes to enable peer, patient and carer recognition for innovation. Don't think of rew ards and recognition as only being top-down, or something th at comes from ' an org anisation'. For m any staff, being recognised by peers, p atients and carers is very import ant and me aningful. Comments from peers and patients could be incorpor ated into an intern al newsletter article, the loc al press, or an intern al awards ceremony. There are a variety of w ays to systemic ally encour age such recognition. For ex ample: \u0081Place wall posters about recently introduced innov ations in p atient c are areas and include a comment w all where p atients and carers c an write wh atever they wish. A selection of these comments c an be re ad aloud at staff meetings on a regul ar basis. (See the box Big Brother's Di ary Room Comes to the NHS for another example involving direct p atient and carer feedb ack on the next p age.) \u0081Set up periodic, but c asual, showc ase events where sever al individu als and te ams are given support to create a posterbo ard where they c an talk about wh at they h ave done.

The point is simply to put your le adership effort to use in f acilitating this sort of interaction, in addition to the more common form al recognition efforts th at leaders should, of course, continue to do. Reward and recognise 'failed' attempts at innovation where you can celebrate learning. Recall the discussion under risk t aking (p ages 12-13 and 60-69 Tips for improving the risk t aking dimension) about how import ant it is to h ave a new mindset about 'f ailure'.Big Brother's Diary Room Comes to the NHS... Wrightington, Wig an and Leigh NHS Trust borrowed the 'diary room' ide a from TV's Big Brother to c apture on-the-spot experiences from p atients and carers in order to gather feedb ack and prioritise ch anges. The te am borrowed a camera from the trust's digit al imaging dep artment and put posters up to invite p atients and carers to t ake part. In the genito-urin ary medicine clinic, the te am made audio recordings inste ad so th at patients could p articipate without feeling uncomfort able. In addition to getting many ide as for improvement from p atients and carers, the recordings also provided a source of very positive feedb ack to st aff on ch anges th at had already been m ade. In the light of its success, the te am is now beginning to visit p atients at home to record their person al stories. These will be pl ayed to the trust bo ard to help sh ape future commissioning pl ans. Failure is an integral part of the innovation process, provided that it is seen as an opportunity for learning and moving on to anext iteration. If individuals and teams who try a new idea thatfails are shunned, even just a little or in seeming jest, they areless likely to try to innovate again. \"The best 'end of project' awards cleverly capture the heart of the achievement.\" Tom Kelly CEO at the design firm IDEOCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 100Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 97Tips for Improving the Rewards Dimension Aligned with or ganisational goals / Reco gnition / Intrinsic motivation / Individualised CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 Page 10198 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersFirm criteria, variable number of winners Countries around the world offer prizes annually to firms th at demonstr ate excellence in qu ality. Sever al of these awards progr ammes follow the philosophy of being firm on a set of criteri a and then recognising as few or as many org anisations as meet these. For ex ample, over the ye ars, the J apanese Deming Prize h as seen ye ars when as many as eight awards were given, as well as a year when no award was presented bec ause no org anisation rose to the st andard. Simil arly, the number of winners of the Americ an Malcolm B aldridge Qu ality Aw ard has varied from two to seven.Whatever you decide to do to recognise innov ation in your te am, org anisation, or he alth system, m ake sure that you design something to also recognise ' attempts with le arning'. When the culture is such th at it seems just as easy to t alk about these ex amples as it is successful innov ations you will h ave gone a long w ay tow ards creating the conditions for innov ation. Grand prizes and competitions create a few winners and lots of losers; instead seek to reward all legitimate innovations and attempts. While it is common to h ave competition schemes where someone wins the prize over everyone else\u2014 and we are not tot ally against such schemes\u2014it is import ant to step b ack for a moment to recognise a potenti al consequence. M any more te ams and individu als 'lose' the competition than win. The potenti al unintended mess age is: \"Your efforts weren't good enough\". A better (or addition al) approach is to est ablish re asonable, but explicit and transparent, criteri a for wh at you want to c all an 'innov ation' or an 'attempt with le arning' and then recognise as many or as few ex amples as meet the criteri a (see box). If there are 37 ex amples th at meet the criteri a, recognise them all equ ally.

Im agining that innov ation will h appen on its own if we just h ave the right culture would be as naive and irresponsible as imagining th at financial controls would n aturally emerge without some deliber ate structures. While everyone is c apable of innov ative thinking, most of us h ave been soci alised to be more conserv ative in our thinking in the work environment, especi ally in he alth care where there are legitim ate risks th at must be managed. Le aders, therefore, need to consider how they build c apability and capacity in deliber ate methods for cre ative thinking. 46% of respondents of the NHS Study on Innovation and Improvement said they would like to receive more support inlearning about tools for innovation and improvement. Source: NHS Institute for Innov ation and Improvement Distinguish between, and channel into appropriate processes and methods, issues that need: (a) adoption of existing better practices from elsewhere, and (b) truly new ideas. Consistent with wh at we have said about the go als dimension, innov ation h appens best when it is str ategically focused. The complex organisations and systems of he alth care cannot sust ain simult aneous, p aradigm- altering ch ange to every thing we do. It would be ch aos, and there is no need to do so. Within an org anisation or he alth system there will be services th at are oper ating well. These m ay still benefit from increment al improvement and/or adoption of well- proven ide as from other NHS or intern ational health care org anisations. Methods from improvement science (e.g., PDSA cycles, see the Improvement Le aders' Guides -available at www.institute.nhs.uk/improvementle aders) are already being applied in most he alth care org anisations and systems in such situ ations. CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 105102 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersIt is import ant to h ave a deliber ate process for identifying those str ategically import ant few issues where fundament ally new thinking is required, in order to focus resources and efforts onto these. This should t ake place as part of existing oper ational and str ategic pl anning structures (e.g., commissioning, the annual planning cycle). You should develop your own simple process for this, but the items in the box provide gener al guidelines. Build consider ations such as these into a simple proform a that you c an integr ate into your existing planning processes. Guidance for identifying issues for application of innovation tools and methods \u0081Ask someone to conduct a deliber ate search for ide as and better pr actices around the ch allenges you f ace as an org anisation or system to see if there is something th at you c an learn from elsewhere. You m ay need to be innov ative in the w ay you adapt the ide a to fit your context, but if the b asic concept behind the ide a will help you achieve your go al then a great deal of work h as already been done and you h ave less risk bec ause you will know th at the ide a has been done elsewhere. Ide as data bases for he alth care already exist (e.g., The He alth Care Innov ation Exch ange sponsored by the US for He althcare Rese arch and Qu ality <http://www.innovations.ahrq.gov/ >) and work is currently underw ay to cre ate such se archable resources in the UK (see the box \"Some available knowledge m anagement resources in the NHS\" on p age 82). \u0081If the go al for improvement is sm all (e.g., single digits percent age-wise), or if you simply need to solve some problems th at have crept in over time and get the service b ack to a level of perform ance th at it has achieved before, you m ay require increment al improvement or adoption of existing better practices and should consider using tr adition al perform ance improvement methods. However, even when the current g ap in perform ance is rel atively sm all, you might still w ant to pl ace a certain challenge in the 'innov ation needed' c ategory. If you know th at the pressure to improve even more will simply continue ye ar-on-ye ar, you might w ant to consider l aunching at least some explor atory ide a gener ation to see if you might jump to a fund ament ally new level of perform ance through innov ation. \u0081If the go al for perform ance is f ar from current levels and there are no existing better pr actices th at you c an adapt, this might be an area for str ategically focused innov ation.

Creative thinking is something th at everyone c an do (Plsek 1997). Providing tr aining and facilitation resources to build this capability in st aff sends a visible mess age that innov ative ide as are desir able. Consider it a natural extension of the improvement te ams, advisors, and toolkits used by m any org anisations. It is import ant to note th at idea gener ation alone is not the whole of the innov ation process. Tools and processes for further development, testing, implement ation and spre ad of ide as are equ ally import ant. Require innovators seeking resources to explore how innovative their idea really is and how they might make it even more innovative. Consider e ach and every ide a for change th at comes to your attention as a 'teachable moment' th at offers you the opportunity to further develop the culture for innov ation. If someone is seeking resources, even if it is only the resource of your authority to proceed, encour age them to also stretch their thinking further.There are many useful tools for stimulating idea generation. The NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement has severalpublications and masterclasses describing such methods and aprogramme to certify innovation practitioners.

Where Where is it done?Specific ally, who else might do something (esp. p atients themselves)? What else might they do, or wh at might they do very differently? Where else could this c are be provided? Where else might we also use this ide a? Asking innov ators to construct such a table to present their ide as almost always stimul ates further innov ative thinking. It need not be an extensive analysis. After using this tool the first few times, you will find th at you can easily construct it in a 10-minute discussion. This simple tool and org anisational ritual can go a long w ay toward cre ating conditions th at favour more innov ative thinking. Plan to introduce new tools or methods for innovation periodically. Spread their use widely in simple ways that help everyone see how they might use them, and publicise their manyapplications. If you are already using a few tools for deliber ate cre ative thinking and innov ation, or after you have implemented some of the tips above, pl an to keep the focus on innov ation fresh by injecting new things into the mix. This continu ally communic ates the v alue you pl ace on new thinking.

The NHS Institute's Thinking Differently guide describes a tool c alled 'Bre aking the Rules' th at can easily be integr ated into the d aily life of an org anisation or system. Challenge st aff for a month to purposefully notice all the 'unwritten rules' and traditions all around them. An e asy way to spot these is to pretend th at one is a man from M ars who is tot ally unf amiliar with health care processes and systems and keeps asking why things are as they are. For example, \"Why is it th at when p atients arrive we ask them to w ait in an area, when actually they c ame to see a clinici an?\" The answer might be, \"Well we h ave to m anage the flow of dem and in some w ay.\" To which a response might be, \"Is a waiting area the only w ay to m anage the flow of dem and? How else could you do it? How is it done elsewhere?\" This invites org anisational convers ation with new thinking as we seek constructive and innov ative w ays to 'bre ak the rule' about always having w aiting areas for p atients. Thinking Differently can be obt ained from www.institute.nhs.uk/thinkingdifferently . The b asic ide a here is to enh ance the culture for innov ation by encour aging more flexible mindsets, and to imbed a few simple methods for innov ative thinking into the org anisation's or system's culture on a regul ar basis. To achieve these go als, make sure th at you also set up a mech anism to c apture some stories of how the new methods h ave stimul ated concrete ch ange and publicise these widely. al communic ations st aff can prob ably help with this. 21/6/10 11:25 Page 110Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 107Tips for Improving the Tools Dimension Flexibility / Deliberate process / Trainin g / Encoura gement for skills development More tips that can also help you enhance the Tools dimension can be found in other sections... \u0081Turn str ategically import ant innov ation efforts into form al organisational projects with allocated resources.

(Risk Taking) CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:25 Page 21/6/10 11:26 Page 112Synopsis The rel ationships dimension refers to the p atterns of inter action between people in the org anisation or system. Innov ative ide as are rarely the product of a lone genius. Even when they might appear to be, delving further into the story ne arly always reve als that the ide a was formed over time and through multiple inter actions with others th at fuelled the process. Therefore, environments where st aff are routinely exposed to a wide r ange of different thinking, from a wide-r ange of people, with a wide r ange of b ackgrounds and points of view, provide rich soil for the growth of innov ation. Of course, it is more th an just exposure; one c an be 'exposed' to a diverse group of people while riding on a train and not be stimul ated to innov ate. There must be a sense of common purpose; of being in a 'team' with others. This te am environment must also en able those with different thinking to trust th at their input will be honoured and explored, r ather th an immedi ately argued against. Create many opportunities for diverse individuals to work together and learn more about each other's ways of thinking. One of the simplest things you c an do to build rel ationships th at favour innov ation is to cre ate more and more opportunities for multi-disciplin ary inter action. Simply put, if you give a group of nurses a challenge to address, they are likely to approach it in w ays tradition al to nurses. The s ame would be true for groups of doctors, m anagers, housekeepers, or admin st aff. Give the s ame ch allenge to a multi- disciplin ary team of nurses, doctors, m anagers, housekeepers, and porters AND provide good te am facilitation that focuses on being explicit about cre ating a trusting, open environment where everyone is curious and respectful of wh at the other thinks, and you m ay get a completely different set of ide as that would not h ave emerged from any of the individu al groups alone. The more opportunities you provide for this sort of working, the e asier and more productive it becomes. It cre ates a mindset shift th at becomes p art of the prev ailing culture over time. The next three tips, while useful on their own, c an also be considered as team-building exercises th at could be productively combined with this one.

Sometimes you need to 'bre ak the ice' in opening up convers ations about the different w ays that people think. If I simply tell you my perception of how I think of you, you might feel th at I am judging you; and beside, I might h ave it all wrong. There are liter ally dozens of simple style instruments th at provide a structure and a language for beginning the explor ation of one another's differences in a more objective w ay. See the box below for one ex ample, and consult with your Hum an Resources Te am who m ay have access to simil ar instruments. Typically, one re ads and responds ( agree-dis agree) to a series of st atements, or selects or r anks preferred items from a menu of choices. These responses or choices are scored in some w ay that then results in a conclusion from the survey instrument. It m akes a great team-building discussion if everyone completes such an instrument, gets some gener al feedb ack from a facilitator to help them interpret their own results, and then shares this inform ation with everyone. The process gives everyone a better appreci ation for differences within the te am, avoiding potenti al frustr ation and en abling more underst anding going forw ard. Style instrument example. The common Myers-Briggs Type Indic ator\u00ae(MBTI) gives one feedb ack on her or his preferred w ays of processing thoughts (m ainly alone or m ainly by bouncing it around with others), coming to decisions (m ainly through logic or m ainly through emotion), and other things. An individu al receives feedb ack on their 'type' th at most people find eerily accurate. A key point is th at there is no right or wrong. E ach type h as its strengths and pitf alls. Each type is useful in some situ ations and less useful in others. Complete thinking is best accomplished by some combin ation of all types. Th at is the v alue in working together as a team. Note: The MBTI is a copyrighted instrument th at requires the p ayment of a licensing fee. There are many other, simil ar instruments. For ex ample, the booklet Managing the Human Dimension of Change , part of the NHS Institute's Improvement Leaders' Guide series, cont ains an instrument th at works just as well for te am building th at is free to use.

Beyond styles and preferences, another sort of diversity th at can be explored productively in te ams is differences in wh at are called 'ment al models'. Ment al models are the im ages th at hum ans naturally cre ate in their mind's eye when they he ar a word. Mental models drive thinking, but if we have different mental models this can lead to conflict and frustration as we try to worktogether. For ex ample, I might s ay, \"Let's be a high performing te am\", and you might re adily agree th at that sounds a good ide a. But if my ment al model of a 'team' is a sailing crew where I am the c aptain calling out orders which I expect you to follow, while your model of a 'team' is a footb all side where everyone is flowing and the b all is being p assed around for e ach player to try to cre ate something then we might find th at we are not working so well together as a team! You will be frustr ated with me for being directive and I will be frustr ated with you for acting as if I am supposed to be p assing you the b all. \"Undervaluing and under investing in the human side of innovation is a common mistake\" Moss K anter.

Harvard Business Review.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:26 Page 115112 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersThe box provides a simple exercise th at you c an do with a task team, leadership te am, or any group of st aff to begin an on-going org anisational dialogue. Exercise: What Do We Mean By 'Team\"? A team-building exercise th at can expose ment al models is simply to ask everyone to think silently for a minute or two about wh at image, ex ample, or analogy they would use to illustr ate a high-performing te am. Ask them to actually draw a picture, or at least write a few words to describe a specific ex ample. Stress th at they must think of a concrete ex ample, not a list of ch aracteristics. Enforce a short period of silence. Don't let anyone s ay anything or give their ex ample yet, as this might bi as others or c ause them to not s ay what they are really thinking in order to fit in. Now, ask everyone to reve al his or her p aper simult aneously and allow everyone to see everyone else's picture. Only then begin going round the group for people to expl ain why they h ave selected their ex ample. Point out differences and simil arities and note th at while there is no right or wrong, it cert ainly is import ant that we h ave at least a somewh at simil ar image in mind if we are to work productively as a team. Start an on-going dialogue about what it means to have a 'trusting and open environment'. Using a similar inter active process to th at in the preceding tip, you might also work on the environment reg arding relationships by exploring p atterns of beh aviour r ather th an analogies. For ex ample, ask people to describe specific beh aviours th at they think of as examples, or counter-ex amples, of a 'trusting and open environment'. Talk about w ays to encour age more of the beh aviours th at others perceive as contributing to a positive environment. \"Your only real path to innovation is through people.

By 'non-tr adition al' we me an, for ex ample, service users, c arers, people in the community, people from the private sector, someone who knows little about how you currently do things, university students, designers, engineers, f amily members, and so on. Be sure to prep are your st aff for how to receive these new te am members. If he alth care staff respond to every suggestion th at these outsiders bring with defensive explanations about why it is the w ay it is and how it simply must be th at way, the fresh input will soon stop. On the other h and, if the fresh perspective is greeted with genuine openness, curiosity, and a desire to see where it t akes us, new approaches to issues are possible.

It's business critical and all of us in the NHS need to be looking for new,improved ways of using our resources to deliver the best services, every day. By innovating however I don't mean we need to lock ourselves in darkened rooms, grow pointy heads and invent. We should be 'stealing' great ideaswherever we see them - from those in our networks, the global health systemand industry. Of course some of the best innovators we have are working for us right now, especially in front line care.

The stillbirth r ate had nearly doubled in the 7-ye ar period from 1996 to 2002, from 5.6 per thous and births to 10.2 per thous and. Over that same period, the stillbirth r ate for Engl and and W ales, as well as for the local region h ad rem ained r ather ste ady around 5.5 per thous and.

The P2 effort, done the UK's n ational Modernis ation Agency and the Institute for He althcare Improvement (IHI) in the US, stressed setting a high b ar for perform ance (e.g., no needless p ain, no needless w aiting). Le aders in both the P CT and at the Luton and Dunst able Hospit al (L&D) s aw it as providing a flexible methodology and set of tools for improvement th at might be helpful. Leaders in the P CT and L&D worked together to present d ata on the issue inform ally to hospit al consult ants and midwives, who were underst andably sceptic al in their initi al reactions.

For ex ample, they were able to show th at even when only comp ared to those other areas of the country with very simil ar popul ations, Luton still had a statistically signific ant higher stillbirth r ate. Slowly, the point w as being made that maybe there w as something to be looked at after all. The P CT and hospit al leaders set up a multi-profession al, multi- agency stakeholders' meeting to present the d ata more form ally, along with stories of people's experiences of c are that had been g athered through interviews. The meeting w as held at a centr al local venue and, unfortun ately, no people who had used the service c ame even though a group of women h ad been invited. The meeting did, however, provide a forum for presenting all the analyses th at had been done thus f ar, as well as some stories of expect ant mothers' and their f amilies' experiences, which were re ad aloud. For ex ample... \"I was worried because I hadn't felt my baby move so I went up to the hospital and they said that they had to find an interpreter. I sat on awheelchair in the corridor for ever such a long time but they couldn'tfind anyone to translate for me. When they examined me they toldme that the baby had died - I'm still not sure why...\" \"When I left hospital after my baby had died I had to walk down that long corridor, out of the building, on my own. If you have a baby themidwife comes down with you to the door but if you haven't shedoesn't. It seemed a very long way on my own...\" The d ata and the people's stories of their experiences, along with cle ar statements from the chief executives th at perh aps some stillbirths might be avoidable and we must do something about it, led to agreement on sever al aims: \u0081To prevent all women, resident in Luton, from experiencing stillbirths \u0081To radically improve the c are of p arents following a stillbirth \u0081Decision to commission a retrospective audit of all stillbirths to Luton residents \u0081Decision to tre at every stillbirth a 'critic al inident' Knowledge: wide scope, free-flowing anduncensoredAppendix 1: Case study illustrating application of the culture for innovation framework in commissioning Goals: 'what' not 'how', high ambitions.

Slowly and patiently, the commissioners and leaders in this case were cre ating the conditions for m aking a bigger difference. The retrospective audit of 111 c ase notes of stillbirths born to Luton resident women highlighted a variety of issues h aving to do with ethnicity, l anguage barriers, and resources available to GP pr actices. The findings set aside several incorrect, but widely believed, theories for the high stillbirth r ate and clearly highlighted the f act that there were m any things th at could be done, at sever al different points in the c are process, to avoid some stillbirths. Interest and commitment to ch ange were growing as various groups of clinici ans and other st aff could see wh at they might be able to do to improve outcomes and care. \"If I had to reflect on the innovation we had done within the patient service arm of the PCT I would emphasise leadership - the setting ofa clear signal from the top, consistently conveyed, that ideas andexperiments were warmly welcomed and staff would be recognisedfor trying.

The meeting w as held at Ghar se Gh ar, a south Asi an women's group, and arrangements were m ade for simult aneous tr anslation into Urdu and Beng ali. The chief executives of the various org anisations attended and were actively involved in le ading the meeting.

In a role-revers al exercise, a member of st aff who only spoke English pl ayed the role of an expect ant mother who h ad to communic ate with a clinici an who only spoke Beng ali, played by one of the tr anslators. The m ainly English- speaking st aff watching the pl ay unfold could immedi ately emp athise in a new w ay with the women as they w atched their colle ague struggle in frustr ation to communic ate with her clinici an. \"For me, this piece of work was the starting point for my own improvement journey.

On a 4Ws T able, this represents a step ch ange in the Who, Wh at, and Where of this aspect of c are. The process of tre ating e ach and every stillbirth as a critical incident\u2014 and having open, non-punitive, multi-profession discussion\u2014is a ance and management ch ange th at has led to a host of ch anges in the processes of c are.

The number of stillbirths to women who are Luton residents is f alling, with the decre ase being attribut able to a dramatic decre ase in ' avoidable' stillbirths. In the ye ar that the effort w as launched, there were 47 stillbirths; 34 of which were cl assified as 'unavoidable', 5 as 'avoidable due to p atient and family f actors', and 8 as 'avoidable due to st aff or protocol f actors'. In the following ye ar, there were only 37 stillbirths. Import antly, 34 were cl assified as 'unavoidable'; the s ame number as the previous ye ar. The over all decre ase comes from the f act that there were only 2 ' avoidable' stillbirths all year, one e ach due to p atient f actors and staff factors. (1 stillbirth w as still under investig ation at the time of this writing). That is a remarkable achievement! However, while the stillbirth r ate has gone from being much worse than average to being slightly better th an average nationally, we might reserve the phr ase 'surprising step change in perform ance' for the future if the tr ajectory continues and this he alth economy m anages to go for, say, longer th an a year with no avoidable stillbirths. Nevertheless, the clinici ans and le aders involved are justifi ably proud of wh at they h ave achieved. The effort is widely recognised by the individu al organisations' le aders, within the he alth economy, and now more widely through present ations at national and intern ational conferences. Equ ally import ant, clinici ans and other st aff involved report a high degree of person al satisfaction in working closely with women and families in this community to m ake a real difference. Given wh at has already been accomplished, we encour age you to 'w atch this sp ace'! Reflecting on the specifics of the ex ample, we also encour age you to think about where the he alth and soci al care services that you commission might be more cultur ally aware and support more independence for people.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:26 Page 136Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 133 Appendix 1: Case study illustrating application of the culture for innovation framework in commissioningCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:26 Page 137134 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersThe key take-away points for commissioners are these: \u0081Creating the culture for innov ation requires persever ance, with emotion al resilience. Don't be surprised or frustr ated by initi al resist ance or rejection. R ather, t ake it as a sign th at you might be re ally pushing the bound aries of people's thinking about wh at is possible\u2014 and th at is a good thing! \u0081Commissioners and leaders need to underst and the required mix of 'h ard' influencers, such as goals and resources, along with 'soft' influencers, such as story telling and tapping into intrinsic motiv ation, if they are to cre ate the right conditions for innov ation to thrive. \u0081The culture for innov ation fr amework provides a useful aid for pl anning and reflection when you are trying to cre ate a more supportive environment. \u0081Successful l arge-sc ale change efforts are likely to be a mix of innov ations, increment al improvements, and adaptations of ide as from elsewhere. It is all for the good as long as it is m aking a difference. \u0081Be patient. It m ay take some time to get all the results you are hoping for. Look for indic ations th at you are on the right p ath tow ards m aking a difference and keep focused on cre ating the conditions to en able even more ange. Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 135Appendix 1: Case study illustrating application of the culture for innovation framework in commissioning Practical applications of the culture for innovation framework for commissioners Use the fr amework to guide your thinking, or to stimul ate open di alogue among your peers, in order to assess the extent to which your environment is either gener ally supportive or not when it comes to innov ation. For ex ample, you might cre ate this reflection at the beginning or end of a contr acting round, or as you are going through your P CT strategy. It is e asy to do, just ch ange the items in the fr amework into questions for reflection... For ex ample, looking at the risk t aking dimension of the fr amework, we c new things? \u0081Do we gener ally do a fairly balanced and re alistic assessment of risk, avoiding being immedi ately dismissive of new ide as based on the worst th at could possibly h appen? \u0081In wh at ways do we provide emotion al support for risk t akers? \u0081Do we actually learn from 'f ailure', or do our beh aviours tend to punish it? Working your w ay through e ach of the dimensions will give you a good feel for areas of strengths and weakness in your system or he alth economy. This will help you focus your efforts as a leader, in partnership with peer le aders, in p atiently working to cre ate the conditions th at favour the emergence of innov ative ide as. You could also use the culture for innov ation fr amework periodic ally during your work on specific projects. Challenge yourself and other le aders to cite ex amples of specific actions you h ave taken recently associated with e ach dimension. Be honest in noting where your recent actions could h ave been perceived as counter to some dimensions.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:26 Page 139136 Appendix 2: Session to the culture for innovationCCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:26 Page 140Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for Leaders 137Appendix 2: Session to assess the culture for innovation Instructions 1.Working individu ally, consider the st atements in the t able on the following p ages for e ach of the seven dimensions of the culture for innov ation. 2.All things considered, and based on your person al experience in the org anisation or system, r ate each dimension on a scale from -5 to +5 as follows: \u0081A value of 0 indic ates th at you feel th at the beh aviours described in the st atements below corresponding with a dimension neither support nor hinder innov ation. \u0081Negative scores indic ate your feeling th at beh aviours and pr actices associated with a dimension tend to hinder innov ative thinking. \u0081Positive scores indic ate your feeling th at beh aviours and pr actices associated with a dimension tend to aid innov ative thinking. \u0081Your sense of the strength of this aid or hindr ance should be reflected in your choice of the number; l arger numbers indic ate more aid or hindr ance as applicable. 3.Share you r atings with those in your group and come to a consensus r ating using an average or a majority-rule. \u0081Discuss dimensions in which there is a wide divergence of opinion. You m ay modify your score if this discussion convinces you to do so. 4.Repeat this process by sh aring your group's r ating with the other groups in your session. \u0081Here, r ather th an forcing a consensus, c apture all the group scores so th at you c an see the natural convergence or divergence of opinion. 5.Discuss the differences of opinion with a curiosity to underst and why these differences exist. \u0081Remember: \"Perception is re ality\". If a group genuinely perceives th at the culture of the organisation hinders or aids a particular dimension then they are more or less likely to displ ay innov ative beh aviour b ased on this perception. 6.Create a summ ary port al chart and discuss wh at it says about the conditions for innov ation in the organisation or system. 7.Select 1-3 dimensions with low scores for further attention and discuss wh at might help to increase the opening on the port al chart.CCFI_LEADERSGUIDE_PDF:Layout 1 21/6/10 11:26 Page 141138 Creating the Culture for Innov ation A Practical Guide for LeadersDimensionFactors that lead to a negative rat- ing on this dimensionFactors that lead to a positive rat- ing on this dimension Risk Taking Formal leaders and opinion le aders fe ar failure.
