ABSTRACT Introduction: Cognitive decline associated with aging could be minor or major neuro-cognitive disorder presenting with progressive intellectual deterioration interfering with day to day activities. Behaviour and personal - ity changes may complicate the life in due course. Significant increase in global prevalence of people aged above 60 years has raised concerns on effective management of old age problems. Age related cognitive deficits and dementia raise to the level of epidemics and established management is yet underway. Principles of preventive health and rasayana (rejuvenative) herbs of Ayurveda are being extensively researched up on for their effec - tiveness in dementia. In this fourteen such herbs with anti dementia prop - erty are discussed with relevant research update. already proven of their efficacy in experimental and preclinical levels. The contents and research evidences are collected from ayurveda database on medicinal plants used in Ayurveda and Siddha and other authentic literature, Google scholar, Science direct, online and print journals. Discussion: The herbs in discussion mostly act on reactive oxy - gen species and oxidative stress injury by properties neuroprotection and modulation activity path ways. Tridosha namely Kapha, Pitta and Vata may be viewed to be categorically predominant in initial, middle and final stage of dementia. Se - lected herbs thus can be specific based on the pathology and relevant do - sha predominance. Conclusion: Rasayana herbs with current updates and inferences can serve as an eye-opener for further researches at molecular and clinical aspect. Key-words: Ayurveda, cognitive decline, Dementia, Herbs, Medhya, Rasay - ana. Key Messages: Rasayana herbs of Ayurveda are a ray of hope to prevent and treat age related cognitive decline. Study on pharmacokinetics of ra - sayana herbs is the need of hour.

The WHO 2012 Report \"Dementia: a public health priority\"1 estimates that there are at present 35.6 million people living in dementia worldwide. As the world's population ages, the frequency is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050.2 Dementia is a disease of aging grouped under neuro-cognitive disorder presenting with progressive deterioration in multiple cognitive domains that is severe enough to interfere with daily functioning.3 The current estimate of 7.7 million new cases per year is an important benchmark, globally and regionally, particularly given the relatively low levels of heterogeneity between studies.1 Enormous researches in the field of medicine and new drug discovery have revolutionized management of old age problems. Unfortunately these developments have failed to impart substantial cure to dementia related issues. Some of the newer drugs and diet researched though documented significant results seem to be either too costly or cumbersome to adapt. Still these results are not translated into health indices. The total global societal costs of dementia were US$ 604 billion in 2010 (Annex 6.11.5).1 2030 worldwide societal costs will have increased by 85%.1 These facts have urged to look towards traditional health systems like Ayurveda (the Indian system of medicine) to reinvent the possi - bilities of healthy ageing and better quality of life for elderly. Ayurveda emphasises on healthy living through ahara (diet) and charya (regimen) based on dinacharya (daily requirement of the body) as well as to suit the ritu (seasonal variations). Periodical shodhana (cleansing), use of rasayana (rejuvenation) therapy go a long way in delaying the compli - cations of ageing and deficits associated with it. Rasayana comprise of therapeutic procedures or preparation that on regular practice will boost nourishment, health, memory, intellect, immunity and hence longevity. Rasayana preparations include single herbs in various medicinal forms and poly herbal combinations specifically aimed to target general health and specific body tissues or attributes. Thus they could be ayushkameeya (to boost general health and longevity) rasayana, vayasthapana (anti-aging), specific) rasayana. Rasayana herbs that aid to prevent age specific complications and boost cognitive faculty is the scope of this paper. Evidences used are mostly facts from researches on animal model or on bioactive principles with some of preclinical works on human system. The contents and cross references are collected from ayurveda database on Medicinal plants used in Ayurveda and Sidha and authentic literature, Google scholar, Science direct, online and print journalsKulkarni et al.: Rasayana herbs to treat age related cognitive decline412 Pharmacognosy Journal, Vol 8, Issue a medium to large deciduous tree. Dried fruit and fresh fruit, seed, leaves, root bark, flowers are used for medicinal purpose (Figure 1).4 Amalaki is highly regarded as vayasthapana and prescribed to be included in daily diet.5 It contains two hydrolysable tannins with low molecular weight (B1000), called embli (2,3-di-o-galloyl-4,6-(S)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-2-keto-gluco - no-d-lactone) and pedun - clagin (2,3,4,6-bis-(S)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-D-glucose) exhibit strong antioxidant action. The two emblicanins A and B have been found to preserve erythrocytes against oxidative stress induced by asbestos, generator of superoxide radical. Fruit extract has been shown to have an anti-mutagenic activity in Ames test.6,7 Recently fruits have been tested for their antiviral activity, particularly for inhibiting reverse transcrip - tase in the replication of retroviruses like HIV-1. Fruit enhances the immune-defence8 and has a hypolipidemic9-11 and hepatoprotective activity.12 Dietary supplement of either of amalaki rasayana (a preparation from Indian goose berry) and rasa sindhoora (an organo-metallic ash prepared from mercury and sulphur) during larval period substantially suppressed neurodegeneration in fly models of polyQ and Alzheimer's disorders without any side effects. Dietary Amalaki Rasayana or Rasa Sindoor prevented accumulation of inclusion bodies and heat shock proteins, suppressed apoptosis, elevated the levels of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins and cAMP response element binding protein and at the same time improved the ubiquitin proteasomal system for better protein ( Terminalia chebula Ketz .) is a large tree seen all over India. Fruits (myrobalans) are used in almost all the ailments (Figure 2). In ' Ayurveda' , myrobalans are used in fevers, cough, asthma, urinary diseases, piles and worms. It is also useful in chronic diarrhea and dysentery, flatulence, vomiting, colic and enlarged spleen and liver.14 Phytochemical combination with belleric and embelic myrobalans under the name of 'Triphala' and also as adjuncts to other medicines in numerous diseases.18 3 g of 'Haritaki' is used in the morning in empty stomach for body strengthening and anti-aging.19 Terminalia chebula showed maximum inhibition in for anti-LPO, anti-superoxide radical formation and free radical scav - enging activities.21 Intra peritoneal administration of ethanol extract of Terminalia chebula enhanced the learning and memory recall ability in male mice in an inverse dose-dependent manner. The pattern of changes of learning & memory induced by TC extract was similar to those of donepezil, is a golden standard medicine for curing the AD.22 Water, methanol, and 95% ethanol extracts of the air-dried fruit of T. chebula Retzius demonstrated chemiluminescence antioxidant activities, and neuro-protective e ffects. The methanol and water extracts exhibit neuro- protective activities against H2O2-induced toxicity toward PC12 cells and are potential candidates for the treatment of herb regarded as master of Indian kitchen. Rhizome is widely used daily in food as well as medicine owing to its multi fold benefits (Figure 3). Rhizome piece or fine powder is added in culinary curry and used as a coloring agent in food. Biologically it is vishaghna (anti toxic), varnya (complexion promoter) and pramehaghna (anti diabetic).24 Traditional Indian medicine conside-red this polyphenolic compound as an effective therapy for several patho- logical conditions, ranging from asthma to epilepsy, from gall stone to diabetic wound healing.25 Ganguli and co-workers found Indians who regularly used cucrumin in curry in food reported lower prevalence of Alzheimer dementia.26 Y et another study reported that elderly healthy individuals who consumed it in curry showed better cognitive perfor - mance.27 Preclinical studies on curcumin reported anti-oxidant and neuro-protective activity of curcumin which was reported to be greater than tocopherol. In particular, curcumin protects neuron-like PC12 rat cells and umbilical endothelial cells against A toxicity and reduces tau hyperphosphorylation28 promotes A uptake from macrophages of AD patients29 and dose-dependently reduces fibril formation and extension, also destabilizing preformed A fibrils30-32 Additionally, curcumin decreased levels of A -induced radical oxygen species33 and inhibits APP cleavage.34 Dietary curcumin (2000 ppm) succeeded in reducing oxidative damage and increased microglial reaction near A deposits. Additionally, low doses of curcumin (160 ppm) avoided the occurrence of spatial memory impairment in rat treated with A infusion. In a study conducted in Tg2576 mice showed that curcumin reduced A oligomer and fibril formation.32 Oral administration of a low dose of dietary curcumin (160 ppm) to an Alzheimer transgenic mouse model (Tg2576) for six months reported reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.35-37 Dietary curcumin (2000 ppm) succeeded in reducing oxidative damage and increased microglial reaction near A deposits. Additionally, low doses of curcumin (160 ppm) avoided the occurrence of spatial memory impairment in rat treated with A infusion. Intravenous administration of curcumin (7.7 mg/kg/day) for 7 days demonstrated an enhanced clearance of A deposit in mouse brain.38 Oral administration of curcumin in a range of 500 to 12000 mg did not report any serious adverse events. curcumin nanoparticles were effective in Alzheimer Tg2576 transgenic mouse model.39 Similar increases in bioavailability were observed if curcumin-phospholipid complex or polymeric micellar curcumin were administered40-41 Oral administration of aqueous extracts of rhizome exhibited antidepressant activity in mice which was associated with inhibition of brain MAO type A.42 Curcumin (10-80 serotonin (5hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) as well as dopamine levels (at higher doses), and inhibited the monoamine oxidase enzymes (both MAOA and MAOB higher doses) in mice.43 Human studies using curcumin incon - clusive or deficient evidences in dementia which in large could be due to poor plasma concentration bioavailability of curcumin alone after oral administration. According to its pharmaco-dynamic properties, curcumin seems to act more as a neuro-protective agent than as a reversal medi - cation.44 The neuro-protective activity is attributed to curcuminoids namely curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and calabin-A.45,46 Majority of these results are reported and anti-inflammatory perennial herb rooting at nodes (Figure 4).52 Fresh whole plant juice is used for therapeutic purposes as Medhya (cognitive enhancer).53 Major constituents are acid, a new triterpenic acid.54 They act on behaviour besides being neuro-protective55 and brain growth promoter.56 Dendritic arborization is supposed to be the neuronal basis for improved learning and memory.57 Anti-seizure activity may result from direct or indirect modulation of ATPase activity.58 Centella asiatica inhibits the memory through the inhibition of AChE.59 BR-16A (Mentat), a Centella asiatica anti- stress effects.60 Methanol extract of Centella asiatica showed highest free radical scavenging activity that can be attributed to the presence of polyphenols and flavonoids as this fraction contains maximum amount of these secondary metabolites (0.07 mg/ml). It also exhibited DNA Kulkarni et al.: Rasayana herbs to treat age related cognitive declinePharmacognosy Journal, Vol 8, Issue 5, Sep-Oct, 2016 413damage protection activity on pRSETA plasmid DNA in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl and 1 mM EDTA) pH 8.0. Chloroform extract of Centella showed highest poly phenolic activity followed by methanol extracts (9.04 g/mg, 7.7 g/mg, 6.76 g/mg Gallic acid equivalents respectively); while flavonoids were abundant in water extracts, followed by chloroform extracts. These two namely poly phenols and flavonoids are responsible for potent anti-oxidant and terminate free radicals.61 Rats treated with C. asiatica in another study showed a dose dependent increase in both cognitive and behaviour paradigms. A significant decrease in MDA and an increase in glutathione and catalase levels were observed only in rats treated with 200 and 300 mg/kg C. asiatica . The results indicated that an aqueous extract of C. asiatica is effective in preventing the cognitive deficits, as well as oxidative stress, caused by i.c.v. STZ in rats.62 The rat pups (7-days-old) were fed with 2, 4 and 6 ml/kg body of fresh leaf juice of CeA for 2, 4 and 6 weeks showed significant increase in dendritic length (intersections) and dendritic branching points along the length of dendrites of the amygdaloid neurons of rats treated with 4 and 6 ml/kg body weight/day of CeA for longer periods of time (i.e. 4 and 6 weeks). The study indicated that constituents/active principles present in CeA fresh leaf juice has neuronal dendritic growth stimulating property; hence it can be used for enhancing neuronal dendrites in stress and other neurodegenerative triterpenes from Centella asiatica exhibhited anti-depressant activity on Administration of Centella asiatica at 1,000 mg/kg b.wt for a period of 30 days in albino showed organ specific toxicity.65 Aindri ( Scrophulariaceae family.66 It is a small, creeping marshy herb grown throughout India (Figure 5).67 Most beneficial therapeutic form is macerated whole plant juice. Properties are said to be similar to that of Mandukaparni.68 Bacopa monniera is a well-known activity may its oxygen species scavenging property.77 Bacopa monniera is plant.78 Bacosides are the main active nootropic principle present in the alcoholic extract of the plant.79 Isolation of a new saponin, a jujubogenin, named bacopasaponin G, and a new glycoside, phenylethyl alcohol was reported.80 Three new saponins designated as bacopasides III, IV and V isolated.81 Apart from memory enhancer activity these bacosides have the potential to modulate the activities of heat stock protein (Hsp70) expression, cytochrome P450 and superoxide dismutase in the rat brain.82 On rats, alcoholic extract increases both cognitive function and retention capacity, decreases retrograde amnesia and protects from phenytoin -induced cognitive deficit.83 It is mainly utilized in the treatment of memory and attention disorders.84 Recent studies have indicated antioxidant effect of bacosides (triternoid saponin isolated from Bacopa monniera against chronic induced oxidative damage in rat brain85 and thyroid T4 hormone stimulating activity in animals in high doses.86 Organic extract of Bacopa monniera in effective doses continuously for six months revealed beneficial effect in improving memory attention span and behavioural problems among demented elderly people.87 Bacopa monniera extract was able to reverse both anterograde and retro - grade amnesia in mice with scopolamine induced amnesia. Thus it was concluded that B. monniera effects on cholinergic system may be helpful for developing alternative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.88 A study evaluated the effect of orally administered alcoholic extracts of Bacopa monniera (at doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) on cognitive function and neuro-degeneration in animal models of Alzheimer's disease induced by ethylcholine aziridinium ion (AF64A). Bacopa monniera extract improved the escape latency time (p<0.01) in Morris water maze test. Moreover, the reduction of neurons and cholinergic neuron densities were also mitigated. The study suggests that Bacopa monniera is a potential cognitive enhancer and neuro-protectant against Alzheimer's disease.89 Y et another study in experimental rats with oral administration of AlCl3 and Bacopa monniera extract 50 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 1 month prevented accumulation of lipid and protein damage significantly induced by aluminium intake. Activity was similar to that of l-deprenyl. It also inhibited decline in the activity of en - dogenous antioxidant enzymes associated with aluminium administra - tion. Results suggest that B. monniera has potential to protect brain from oxidative damage resulting from aluminium toxicity.90 B. monniera (50 mg/kg body weight) supplementation reversed memory impairment in the colchicine treated rats by attenuating oxidative damage, as evident by decreased LPO and protein carbonyl levels and restoration in activities of the antioxidant enzymes. Also, Bacopa monnieri supplementation was able to restore the altered activity of membrane bound enzymes (Na+K+ ATPase and AChE) as compared to the controls.90 In adult swiss mice extracts of Bacopa monnieri produced anti-dementic activity against scopolamine induced dementia and dependent antiAChE activity.91,92 special BM extract and drasti - cally up regulating the mRNA and protein expression of BDNF, Arc, and GFAP in mouse cerebrum. Study also provides first molecular evidence for anti-amnesic potential of CDRI-08 via enhancement of CREB mediated basal transcriptional machinery of memory linked markers.93 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on elderly participants aged 65 or older (mean 73.5 years) without clinical signs of dementia, B. monniera extract (300 mg/day per oral) enhanced Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test(AVLT) delayed word recall memory scores and Stroop Task assessing the ability to ignore irrelevant information. Study also showed reduction in Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CESD-10) depression scores, combined state plus trait anxiety scores, and heart rate over time.94 In an open label, prospective, uncontrolled, nonrandomized study on human participants newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, Bacopa monnieri standardized extract 300 mg twice a day orally for 6 months resulted in improvement in orientation (of time, place & person), attention and in language components (reading, writing & comprehension) of cognitive functions using Mini Mental State Examination Scale (MMSES). The trial also reported improvement in their quality of life, and decrease in the irritability and insomnia.95 Y astimadhu ( Glycirrhiza glabra Linn .) herb or under shrub belonging to Fabaceae family.96 Fine powder of dried root is used internally with milk for therapeutic purpose as Medhya (Figure 6). Active ingredients are glycyrrhizine, to glycyrrhizine and flavonones. Yashtimadhu is cytotoxic and its prolonged use may lead to pseudoaldosteronism,100 hyperkalemia,101 and hypertension.102,103 The roots and rhizomes of G. glabra has been studied with respect to spatial learning and passive avoidance104 preliminary free radical scavenging105 cerebral is chemia106 and antioxidant capacity towards LDL oxidation.107 Glycyrrhiza glabra aqueous extract markedly improves antihypoxic effects induced by sodium nitrite in rats and this effect may be mediated by its antioxidant properties.108,109 The roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza glabra is an efficient brain tonic; it increases the circulation into the CNS system and balance the sugar levels in the blood.110 Liquorice has significant action on memory enhancing activity in dementia.111 It significantly improved learning and memory on scopolamine induced dementia. Oral glabridin administration (25 and 50 mg/kg) improved learning and memory in Kulkarni et al.: Rasayana herbs to treat age related cognitive decline414 Pharmacognosy Journal, Vol 8, Issue 5, Sep-Oct, 2016 Figure 1: Amalaki ( treat age related cognitive declinePharmacognosy Journal, Vol 8, Issue 5, Sep-Oct, 2016 415non-diabetic rats, it also reversed learning and memory deficits of diabetic rats. The study concluded that glabridin prevented the deleterious effects of diabetes on learning and memory in rats by combination of antioxidant, neuroprotective and anticholinesterase properties.112 The higher doses and scopolamine mg/kg; i.p.) in an experimental model. Furthermore, both glabridin (2 and 4 mg/kg; p.o.) and metrifonate (50 mg/kg; i.p.), used as a standard drug, remarkably reduced the brain cholinesterase activity in mice compared to the control group. The study indicated that glabridin can be a promising candidate for memory improvement and can be used in the management of Alzheimer patients.113 Guduchi ( Tinospora cordifolia (Wild) Miers glabrous, deciduous, climbing shrub of Menispermaceae family found throughout tropical India (Figure 7).114 Juice of whole plant is used therapeutically as Medhya .53 It is also used in the form of decoction, powder and Satwa (starch extract of stem). Its root is known for its anti-stress, anti-leprotic ameliorative properties to their antioxidant and trace element contents.118 Tinospora cordifolia is known to be a rich source of trace elements (Zinc and Copper) which act as antioxidants and protects cells from the damaging effects of oxygen radicals generated during immune activation.119 It increases the blood profile and has lead scavenging activity.120 Tinospora cordifolia has been claimed to antioxidant,122,123 and anti-stress activity.124 Tinos and cognition deficits animals in behavioural test Hebb William maze and passive age related cognitive decline416 Pharmacognosy Journal, Vol 8, Issue 5, Sep-Oct, 2016task.125 Mechanism of cognitive enhancement is by immune-stimulation and increasing the synthesis of acetylcholine, this supplementation of choline enhances the cognition.126 Myriad actions of Guduchi may be attributed to its antioxidant127,128 and immune-modulatory properties.129 Administration of aqueous and alcoholic extracts of Tc (100 and 200 mg/kg respectively) for 15 days in an experimental model enhanced cognition (learning and memory) in normal rats and rats with cyclosporine induced memory deficit. It also provided hippocampal protection in normal rats as against cyclosporine treated rats showed neurodegenerative changes on histopathological study.130 Oral administration of Tinospora cordifolia (500 mg aqueous extract) for 30 healthy volunteers (age 18-30 years) in a double blind, randomized and placebo controlled design enhanced verbal learning and memory and logical memory (of immediate and short term type).131 Tc also showed significant antidepressant activity by increasing brain monoamines.132 The most likely antidepressant mechanisms involve inhibiting reuptake of mines in the brain, improved levels of norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5hydroxytryptamine or 5HT), and dopamine (DA), Shankhapushpi ( Convolvulus pleuricaulis Chois ) is a perennial, prostate or sub erect spreading hairy herb (Figure 8),134 found throughout India.135 Recommended therapeutic form is fine paste of whole plant. Highly regarded as Medhya (intellect promoter).53 Important chemical principles are microphyllic acid, shankhapushpin, kaempferol-kaempferol-3-glucoside, 3, 4 dihydroxycinnamic acid, sitosterols. Neuro-protective and intellect promoting activity implicated to free radical scavenging and antioxidant property.136 BR-16A (Mentat), a poly herbal combination containing Shankhapushpi significantly reversed the social isolation stress-induced prolongation of onset and decrease in pentobarbitone-induced sleep, increased total motor activity and stress-induced antinociception in experimental model.137Ayushman-8 (containing Shankhpushpi, Brahmi and to containing Shankhapushpi, Sarpagandha , and in quanitities studied to effective in Chittodvega (anxiety disorders).139 Sanjay Parsania140 reported Shankhapushpi to be effective in relieving signs and symptoms of Chittodvega (anxiety disorders). Herbalists believe that Shankhpushpi calms the nerves by regulating the body's production of the stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol.141 Few investigations reports that Shankhpushpi has potent depressive action in mice.142 In an experimental study, a dose dependent enhancement of memory was observed with Convolvulus pluricaulis and Asparagus racemosus. Hippocampal regions associated with the learning and memory functions showed dose dependent increase in AChE activity in CA1 with AS and CA3 area with CP treatment. The underlying mechanism of these actions of CP and AE may be attributed to their antioxidant, neuro-protective and cholinergic properties.143 Daily administration of CP (150 mg/kg) for 3 months along with aluminium chloride (50 mg/kg) decreased the elevated enzymatic activity of acetylcholine esterase and also inhibited the decline in Na+/K+ATPase activity aluminium intake. Beside, preventing accumulation of lipid and protein damage, changes in the levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes associated with aluminium administration were also improved. Oral administration of CP preserved the mRNA levels of muscarinic receptor 1 (M1 receptor), choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) and Nerve Growth Factor- Tyrosine kinase A receptor (NGF-TrkA). It also ameliorated the up regulated protein expression of cyclin dependent kinase5 (Cdk5) induced by aluminium. The potential of CPE to inhibit aluminium induced toxicity was compared with rivastig - mine tartrate (1 mg/kg), which was taken as standard. The potential of the extract to prevent aluminium-induced neurotoxicity was also reflected at the microscopic level, which indicated its neuro-protective effects.144 Oral administration of CP extract (150 mg/kg) to scopolamine treated rats reduced the increased protein and mRNA levels of tau and APP levels followed by reduction in A levels compared with scopolamine treated group.145 Jyotishmati (Celastrus panniculata) is a large, woody, climbing shrub with ovate or obvovate leaves found all over India (Figure 9).146 Seed oil (Jyotishmati Taila ) is known for like paniculatadiol, b-sitosterol, celastrol, b-amyrin, pristimerin, but its terpenoids, dihydroagarofuran-type polyols or esters.148 the lipid peroxidation149 and anti-arthritic activity in rat model.150 Seed oil of Celastrus panniculata (Malkangni ) reversed scopolamine-induced deficits in navigational memory task in young adult rats.151 study revealed an increased cholinergic activity of brain is noted resultant up on decreased in AChE activity assayed from hypothalamus, frontal cortex and hippocampus of the rat brain treated with 400 mg/kg body weight. No side effects were observed with administration of the seed oil.152 Kushmanda (Benincasa hispida ) belonging to Cucurbitaceae an extensive trailing or climbing herb cultivated throughout the plains of India as a vegetable.153 The fruit, broadly cylindrical, is covered with a waxy bloom (Figure 10).154 Phytochemical of and serves as ROS scavenger and an antioxidant effective agent.156 It has a tissue protective preventive effect on colchicine induced Alzheimer's disease via direct ) of Araceae semiaquatic, perennial, aromatic herb with its rhizome being horizontal, rounded, somewhat vertically compressed, spongy and leaves grass like and sword shaped; grown all over India.158 Rhizome is useful part having Medhya quality (Figure 11). It has been used in Indian and Chinese system of medicine for hundreds of years to cure diseases especially the central ner - vous system (CNS) abnormalities.159-162 Active chemical principles are -asarone, elemicine, calamendiol,spathulenol and sitosterol are also present.163,164 It for its and anticonvulsant,165 hepatoprotective,166 antioxidant,167,168 antimutagenic,169 sedative and hypothermic effects170 good in the children171,172 and useful in schizophrenic psychosis.173 Acorus calamus possesses a beneficial memory enhancing property for memory impair - ment, learning performance, and behavior modification. Essential oil from rhizome and -asarone inhibits the acetylcholinesterase (AChE).174,175 -asarone inhibits the activity of hippocampal neurons and produces antiepileptic effect in central nervous system through enhancing tonic GABAergic inhibition.176 Food and Drug Administration banned usage its oil in food formulations and in other therapeutic preparations177 due carcinogenic and toxic properties of -asarone compound.178 Ethanolic extract demonstrated to possess potential anti- oxidative, anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective actions.179-181 Experimentally, it has also been reported to decrease free radical generation via enhancement of anti-oxidant mechanisms such as increase in superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidise levels.182 Additionally, it is shown to be a neuroprotective action against the hypoxic (ischemia) event and chemical (i.e. acryl - amide) induced severe insult in nervous system.183-185 Acorus calamus has also been shown to modulate calcium channel activity 186 thus attenuating CCI induced peripheral neuropathic pain.187 Oral administration of Kulkarni et al.: Rasayana herbs to treat age related cognitive declinePharmacognosy Journal, Vol 8, Issue 5, Sep-Oct, 2016 417methanol extract of rhizome of A. calamus in rodents exhibited an anti - depressant-like activity, probably by modulating the central neurochemical as well as HPA axis in response to stress induced by FST.188 Jatamamsi ( Nardostachys jatamamsi ) is an erect with long, stout, woody, greyish, rhizomatous, tail-like rootstock covered with reddish-brown hairs or remains of the petioles of withered radical leaves,189 and belongs to Valerianaceae family. Rhizome is used for medicinal purposes as it is Bhutaghna or Manasa Doshahara (relieves of psychiatric problems) and Medhya (Figure 12).190 Roots and rhizomes of N. jatamansi are used to treat hysteria, epilepsy, and convul - sions.191 The decoction of the drug is also used in neurological disorders, insomnia and disorders of cardiovascular system.192 Rhizomes contain a terpenoid ester, nardostachysin I193 and variety of sesquiterpenes and coumarins.It is proven to improve learning and memory in mice194 and also to enhance biogenic amine activity.195 An alcoholic extract of this plant administered to both young and aged mice significantly improved learning and memory and also reversed aging induced amnesia due to diazepam and scopolamine.196 Nardostachys jatamansi extract prevented chronic restraint stress-induced learning and memory deficits in a radial arm maze task.197 In another study, hydroalcohol extract of Nardostachys jatamansi rhizome showed AChE inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 130.11612 mg/ml.198,199 An acetone extract of N. has shown significant inhibition of benzoyl peroxide-induced toxicity, and ear oedema in mice.200 Ethanolic extracts of NJ showed a dose dependent increase in the number of surviving neurons and anti-Parkinson effects.201 Ashvagandha ( Withania somnifera ) commonly known as Indian winter cherry or Indian ginseng is most used rasayana herb in Indian system of medicine. It is clinically used for the treatment of general debility, consumption, nervous exhaustion, insomnia, loss of memory, and so on.202 finely powdered root is therapeutically used with water, milk, ghee (clarified butter) or honey. Root is extensively used for therapeutic purpose (Figure 13). Chemical constituents include has been reported as promising anti-cancer drug candidate due to its cytotoxic,204 apoptotic,205 anti- metastatic206 anti-mitotic207 and anti-angiogenesis properties.208 The herb is reported to possess beneficial effects in a wide range of central nervous system (CNS) pathology in rodents. These include catalepsy, cognitive and memory impairment, orofacial dyskinesia,10 stress, Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebral stroke, epilepsy, excitotoxicity, in sleep disturbed mice, chronic fatigue syndrome, streptozotocin induced stress, copper-induced oxidative stress and rotenone-induced oxidative (2.15 mg/kg), mg/kg) Withanalide A has attracted interest due to its neuropharmacological properties of promoting synaptic and outgrowth reconstruction at a dose of 4.7_g/kg.212 WLD is therefore an important candidate for the therapeutic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), convul - sions, cognitive function impairment, as it is able to reconstruct neural networks.213 The underlined molecular mechanisms studies on W A and WLD demonstrated modulation of multiple targets such as transcrip - tional factors, inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, growth factors, receptors and other targets suggesting promising drug candidates for cancer and neurological disorders214 Withania Sitoindosides and acylsteryl glucosides in Ashwagandha are anti-stress agents. Widely researched and proven for its effect on age related cognitive decline and dementia. WSG also exhibited an antidepressant effect, comparable with that induced by imipramine, in the forced swim induced 'behavioural despair' and 'learned helplessness' tests.215 In a study, a 30-days course of oral administration of a semipurified extract of the root of Withania somnifera consisting predominantly of withanolides and withanosides reversed behavioural deficits, plaque pathology, accumulation of -amyloid peptides (A) and oligomers in the brains of middle-aged and old APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice. It was similarly effective in reversing behavioural deficits and plaque load in APPSwInd mice (line J20).216 The cell death caused by beta-amyloid was negated by treatment with withanamide from withania fruits. Molecular modeling studies showed that withanamides A and C uniquely bind to the active motif of beta- amyloid (25-35) and suggest that withanamides have the ability to prevent the fibril formation.217 Systematic review on W . somnifera reveled successful inhibition of neurobehavioural abnormalities produced by different physical and chemical stimuli on oxidative stress in rodent brain. It also significantly decreased the increased LPO, protein carbonyl, AchE and nitrite levels in different parts of rodent brain. The natural cellular antioxidants (SOD, catalase and GPx) and the non-enzymatic anti- oxidant like GSH, ChAT and Ach alteration in the neuropathological environment were also considerably restored to normal by W. somnifera .209 Kapikacchu (Mucuna pruriens (Linn.)) DC is a herbaceous twinning annual plant found all over India. Useful parts are root, leaves, seed and hairs (Figure 14). Mostly used as aphrodisiac, rejuvinative and nervine tonic in Ayurveda.218 it is extensively used in the treatment of parkinson's disease as it is a good source of L-3, 4 dihydroxyphenyl alanine (L-DOPA).219,220 It is known to increase secretion of semen and it act as a restorative and aphrodisiac in sexual dysfunction characterized by weakness or loss of sexual power.220 Seeds of M. pruriens possess anti- oxidant, hypoglycemic, lipid lowering and neuroprotective activities.221 The neuro protective activity may be due to alkylamines, steroids, flavonoids, coumarins, like manganese and iron.223 Treatment with M. pruriens significantly ameliorated psychological stress and seminal plasma lipid peroxide levels along with improved sperm count and motility.224 The nigrostriatal portion of Parkinsonian mouse brain showed significantly increased levels of nitrite, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced levels of catalase besides improved the behavioral abnor - malities as compared to the control.225 DISCUSSION A review on selected rasayana herbs of Ayurveda revealed their potential to combat age related cognitive decline. The herbs reviewed herbs showed anti-oxidant and neuro-protective activities. Apart from anti-oxidant activity other factors that aid in anti-dementia and neuro protection are acetylcholine estarase of Tau aggregation, Folic acid, glutamic acid, Vitamin B etc. Rasayana herbs presenting with inhibition and haridra. Reduction in amyloidal mandukaparni. Thus these rasayana herbs act by more than one way to break down the pathological path way in age related cognitive decline and hence can be potential contender in treatment of dementia. More -Kulkarni et al.: Rasayana herbs to treat age related cognitive decline418 Pharmacognosy Journal, Vol 8, Issue 5, Sep-Oct, 2016over, rasayana drugs enhance digestion, tissue metabolism, nutritional quality of plasma (rasa) and micro circulation.226 Besides this, most of the drugs discussed are medhya (nootropic) in nature with specific action as medhya (specific to nervous system) as well as their multi- dimensional utility.227 by virtue of the trace elements present in them. Getting deep into characteristics of drugs it may be postulated that regular usage of haridra, hareetaki,228-230 amalaki, vacha will go a long way to prevent Dementia & related complications. Early usage of Aindri, man - dukaparni, jyotishmati, jatamamsi, ashvagandha & shankapushpi as single herb or in combination are beneficial in neuro degenerative con - dition, 1st & 2nd stage of Dementia and Lewy bodies pathology for sec - ondary prevention. Kapichacchu, Ashvagandha, Jatamamsi & Haridra singly or in combination are better choice in treating dementia associated with Huntington's disorder. Guduchi, Vacha, Ashvagandha, Kushmanda, Y astimadhu, Aindri, Guduchi and Kushmanda are favourable in dementia due to tox - ic pathology like aluminium toxicity, food toxicity and radiation hazards etc. Kushmanda, Aindri, Guduchi, Y astimadhu, Jatamamsi and Ashvagandha are useful in dementia associated with anxiety, depression and personality changes. In the first stage (1 to 2 year of onset) gradual onset of forgetfulness for recent events, become lost in familiar places, loss of track, time including day, month, year and season, difficulty in communication, finding words, making decisions, handling finance, mood changes, lack of interest and difficulty in carrying complex household activities. This stage at the onset is often overlooked as a part of normal aging process. Middle stage of the disease (2-5 years of the onset) presents with more precise progressive limitations and restrictions. Progressive forgetfulness for recent events and people's names, difficulty in comprehending time, date, place and events, may become lost in home and community, difficulty in speech, comprehension and communication. Assistance is required in personal care (toileting, washing and dressing). Inability to prepare food, cook, clean, shop, live alone safely without any assistance. Behaviour changes include inappropriate behaviours at home and community, wandering, repeated questioning, calling out, clinging, disturbed sleep and halluci - nations. Last stage (after 5 yr of onset) is of nearly total dependence and inactivity. Memory disturbances are very serious and the physical side of the disease becomes more obvious. Usually unawareness of time, place, people and events happening around prevails. Progressive dependence in self-care, sphinctural incontinence, changes in mobility, behaviour (aggression and nonverbal agitation including kicking, hitting, screaming and moaning etc). Other features may vary based on the co-morbidities and pathology.1 1st stage of Dementia can be managed on the lines of Kapha Dosha. In this stage, Haridra and Jyotismati can be used. Second stage of dementia is ideally managed on the lines of Pitta Dosha. In this stage, Mandookaparni, Aindri, Haridra and Y astimadhu are the better choice. Last stage of Dementia can respond well to Vata dosha management like can be used in all 3 stages because of its ability to pacify all 3 doshas. CONCLUSION Ample of evidences through experimental and pre-clinical studies have proven the efficacy of Ayurveda herbs in age related cognitive decline. In spite of their effective clinical use through ages valid document is sparse. The need of hour is to study the molecular basis of these herbs in humans.
