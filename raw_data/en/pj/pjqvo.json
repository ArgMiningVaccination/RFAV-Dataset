Dr Young told ABC's 7.30 Queensland the mother was convinced her child was vaccinated until she was asked about it by a doctor at the Mater Hospital. \"The mother said 'yes, my child is fully vaccinated, I believe in vaccination, but the person who vaccinated my child said that if you were to test my child you wouldn't find any evidence because it's a different sort of vaccination',\" Dr Young said. \"The doctor explored that with the child's mother and worked out that a homeopath had told the mother that he had vaccinated the child when clearly the child had not been vaccinated. \"The mother thought she had done the right thing and wanted to do the right thing by her child and believed this healthcare provider, who misled her.\" Some homeopaths offer a treatment called homeopathic prophylaxis which aims to strengthen a person's immune system, but public health authorities say there is no evidence it works. Dr Young says it is unacceptable for a practitioner to sell the treatment as a real alternative to vaccination. She has says she intends to raise the alarm with the Therapeutic Goods Association, which regulates all medical treatments, and the Health Quality and Complaints Commission (HQCC). \"We have got to do something about it - this is very serious,\" she said. \"I am looking at whether we can notify the TGA and what they might be able to do, whether Fair Trading here in Queensland has a role. I have already asked that this issue be referred to the HQCC. \"I don't want him to do this to other children.\" Strict guidelines cover use of homeopathic prophylaxis The Australian Homeopathic Association has distanced itself from the case, saying the practitioner is out of line. President Greg Cope says there are strict guidelines about the use of homeopathic prophylaxis, including a compulsory consent form stating the treatment is not an immunisation. \"It would certainly be concerning if a person has had one technique and perhaps was not aware of the difference between it and something else,\" he said. \"That is the reason why we have quite specific guidelines that ensure that someone who requests homeopathic prophylaxis is educated as to what they are requesting before that service is provided by a practitioner.\" He says he supports Dr Young's push for further action against the practitioner. \"I certainly support investigation into anything like this and it's very important that practitioners are providing services and accurate information about those services,\" he said. Dr Young says it is not the first time a homeopathic treatment has been passed off as a vaccine. \"We've seen it also raised in NSW where they've had a few instances,\" she said. \"I don't know how common in Queensland, but just one child is too much, particularly if the mother thinks the child was protected. \"I can understand if some people believe that homeopathy is effective and they go and choose to go through that, but for someone to be misled that their child is protected, when they're not protected, I "}
