Rely on chiropractic services from Dr. John Milham. From chronic pain to knee and back pain, we have helped many patients take back their lives. In most cases, when we experience pain, we tend to \"baby\" the area so as to not cause more pain in that area. This is hardly an effective means of pain management.

We know you've tried other solutions. To learn more about a solution that actually works, hear from a few of our past chiropractic patients: \"Dr. Milham is very professional, as well as kind, caring, and compassionate.\" - William (Niskayuna, NY) \"Had constant leg and hip pain at the start.
