Front Immunol ; by the overarching aim to generate efficacious [vaccines]normally indicated by an antibody and/or cellular response that correlates with [protection]. However, this approach has been shown to be only a partially effective [measure], since [vaccine]- and pathogen-specific [immunity]may not perfectly overlap. Thus, some [vaccine development] [strategies], normally focused on targeted generation of both [antigen]specific antibody and [T cell]responses, resulting in a long-lived heterogenous and stable pool of [memory] [lymphocytes], may benefit from better mimicking the [immune response]of a natural [infection]. However, challenges to achieving this [goal]remain unattended, due to gaps in our [understanding]of [human] [immunity]and full elucidation of infectious [pathogenesis]. In this [review], we describe recent advances in the development of effective [vaccines], focusing on how [understanding]the differences in the immunizing and non-immunizing [immune responses]to natural [infections]and corresponding shifts in immune ontogeny are crucial to inform the next "}
