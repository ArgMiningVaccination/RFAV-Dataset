The Office of Dietary Supplements notes that toxicity is unlikely on a daily dose of [250 microgram (mcg)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) This article details the role of vitamin D in the body and the potential side effects of overexposure. [Vitamin D](/articles/161618.php) is a fundamental nutrient that supports several bodily processes, [including](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) - the absorption and regulation of [calcium](/articles/248958.php), [magnesium](/articles/286839.php), and phosphate - the hardening, growth, and remodeling of bones - immune function - nerve and muscle function Many people get enough vitamin D from [sun exposure](/articles/326167) and their diet. Some choose to take supplements. How much vitamin D should a person take? A person's daily vitamin D requirement [depends on](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/) Doctors consider vitamin D levels [adequate](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) Below are some of the most serious side effects of over-supplementing vitamin D. Many of the significant side effects of vitamin D toxicity are related to [hypercalcemia](/articles/322012). Hypercalcemia [refers to](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) Researchers often cite this threshold as [10.4 mg](https://www.msdmanuals.com/en-gb/professional/endocrine-and-metabolic-disorders/electrolyte-disorders/hypercalcemia) of calcium per deciliter (dL) of a strong relationship between vitamin D and calcium. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Having too much calcium [can lead](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) Some of the most serious include: - appetite](/articles/324011)and increased continuous [headache](/articles/73936.php) [high blood pressure](/articles/159283.php) Excess calcium in the body due to vitamin D toxicity [may promote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872784/) [kidney stones](/articles/154193) in people who are predisposed to the condition. Excess calcium in the bloodstream binds with phosphate, forming crystals that deposit in soft body tissues. These crystals [can cause](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/febs.15174) When the crystals get stuck in kidney tissues, [nephrocalcinosis](/articles/319418) (kidney stones) can occur. If this condition is severe, it can cause permanent kidney damage and [kidney failure](/articles/327300). Symptoms [fever](/articles/168266.php)and [chills](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/chills) - severe pain in the stomach, the sides of the back, or the groin area Vitamin D levels [have links](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) [cardiovascular disease](/articles/257484). Extreme hypercalcemia can [reduce the functionality](https://academic.oup.com/ejcts/article/54/4/784/4956920) of cells in the heart. People with severe hypercalcemia may also experience [irregularities in their heartbeat](/articles/8887). A person with severely high levels of calcium or phosphate in the blood [may also develop](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) Some signs of heart complications associated with vitamin D toxicity [include](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2018.00550/full): - an irregular heartbeat, which may be temporary or continual - drowsiness [high blood pressure](/articles/159283) Vitamin D toxicity can cause hypercalcemia and subsequent problems with the bones, including [a loss of bone density](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2748796) Some symptoms include: - aching or [painful bones](/articles/321835) - bones that are prone to [fractures](/articles/173312.php)or breaks [bone cysts](/articles/318976) [gait abnormalities](/articles/320481) Elevated calcium levels in the blood can harm the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine. This may result in a person producing and passing unusually large quantities of urine, known as [polyuria](/articles/70782.php). When a person passes diluted urine, they lose large quantities of water and [electrolytes](/articles/153188). For this reason, a person with vitamin D toxicity may be prone to [dehydration](/articles/153363.php). Symptoms of moderate dehydration [include](https://medlineplus.gov/dehydration.html): Severe dehydration can result in life threatening conditions. Other signs and symptoms of this condition include: - rapid heartbeat and breathing - confusion [fainting](/articles/182524) - lack of urination [low blood pressure](/articles/159609) - unexplained exhaustion Hypercalcemia can cause [acute pancreatitis](/articles/160427.php), which is the term for [inflammation](/articles/248423.php) of the pancreas. A [2017 review](https://www.sjkdt.org/article.asp?issn=1319-2442;year=2017;volume=28;issue=6;spage=1321;epage=1329;aulast=Chowdry) found that 2 of 19 people with vitamin D toxicity experienced acute pancreatitis as a complication. Each had taken an average of 6,000,000 international units (IU) of the vitamin over 1-3 months. Signs of pancreatitis [include:](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/pancreatitis/symptoms-causes) - upper stomach pain that extends to the back - nausea and vomiting - a rapid pulse - swollen or tender abdomen - fever A [2018 study](https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article/49/2/123/4807321?login=true) found there has been an increase in the incidence of vitamin D toxicity due to more people supplementing vitamin D without a doctor's supervision. However, symptomatic vitamin D toxicity remains rare. High vitamin D levels typically result from consuming excessive amounts of high dose dietary supplements. A person cannot get too much vitamin D from the sun. The 2018 study also found that certain high dose vitamin D formulations (50,000 IU doses) were common in people with elevated vitamin D levels. The body stores vitamin D in fat tissues, and it can take weeks or months for the effects of vitamin D toxicity to fully wear off. Dietary vitamin D supplements are useful when it is not possible to otherwise meet the recommended vitamin D requirements. However, vitamin D supplements are not suitable for everyone. People with the [following conditions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5045493/) - granulomatous disorders, such as - idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia [Crohn's disease](/articles/151620) Vitamin D drug interactions Vitamin D supplements can [interact](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/) For example, high dose vitamin D supplements can [reduce the efficacy](https://www.dovepress.com/a-literature-review-of-the-potential-impact-of-medication-on-vitamin-d-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-RMHP) of cholesterol-lowering statins such as [atorvastatin](/articles/atorvastatin-oral-tablet). A doctor will assess a person's health status before prescribing [statins](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8274). It is essential to follow medical guidance when taking any medications. Other medications can affect a person's vitamin D levels. - Steroids: Steroids such as [prednisone](/articles/prednisone-oral-tablet)can lower vitamin D levels. - Orlistat: This weight loss medication can decrease vitamin D absorption rates. - Thiazide [diuretics](/articles/diuretics): These medications can raise a person's blood calcium levels if they take them alongside vitamin D supplements. While these outcomes are not the direct result of drug interactions, it is important to be aware of them. A person should always consult with a healthcare professional before taking supplements. Symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include: - unexplained exhaustion [dry mouth](/articles/187640) - increased thirst and frequency of urination - nausea and vomiting - confusion, disorientation, or trouble thinking - irregular heartbeat Health risks of too much vitamin D People with severe or chronic vitamin D toxicity may develop life threatening symptoms, including: - extreme dehydration - high blood pressure - slowed growth - trouble breathing - temporary losses of consciousness [heart failure](/articles/156849.php)or [heart attack](/articles/151444.php) - kidney stones or kidney failure [hearing loss](/articles/249285.php) [tinnitus](/articles/156286.php)(ringing in the ears) - pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) [gastric ulcers](/articles/312045) [coma](/articles/173655.php) Vitamin D toxicity can cause a wide range of symptoms, and each individual may respond differently. A person may have a higher risk of experiencing toxicity if they take high dose supplements over an extended period. Doing this can cause vitamin D to build up in the blood. The risk of experiencing adverse side effects from vitamin D in the diet or through exposure to the sun is very low. "}
