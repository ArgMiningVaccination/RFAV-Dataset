My sense/knowing is that it's important to provide this information to everyone, regardless of resource level, first for the well-being of the individual, to increase our personal inner light; second, for the well-being of the planet and all within it's care; and ultimately, for the wholeness. - --- My wish is that you benefit from this activity. - This group was created to provide information and practice for these processes and methods, to gather and expand our knowledge through shared research and discussion, through group meetings and meditations, through community. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ - Holistic Medicine is the practice of treating the whole person, body, mind and spirit; of looking deeply within for the root cause of problems. Derived from Ancient Greek (h\u00f3los) 'all, whole, entire', and -ism, it is the idea that various systems of a person be they physical/biological, social, mental, emotional or spiritual should be viewed as together and that people should be treated not as merely a collection of parts. - Naturopathic Medicine is a system of healthcare that evolved from a combination of non-traditional practices and approaches but specifically refers to treatments in which the practitioner \"does no harm\" to the patient (e.g., sewing, cutting, burning), although no treatment can guarantee that it will do no harm. - The base ideas to both is that different parts of a person are all interconnected and cannot be understood without understanding the entire being. - Traditionally, holistic medicine is concerned only with the one being currently sitting in front of a practitioner. With this group, we are adding the element of the Whole being, not just that part sitting in the chair today. For that being, it could include experiences from a distant past. From a higher-level viewing point, this greater perspective takes the approach that assisting this one being achieve a state of greater health will also increase their inner light, that increasing that one person's inner light will help increase the light a small bit of the entire planet and in turn all that exists, raising everyone and everything up just a wee bit, benefiting the whole of creation. - Nature based medical processes including both problem identification and treatments of imbalance include energetic therapies utilizing subtle energies to improve our life experiences such as homeopathy, reiki, light healing touch, cranial/sacral therapy, and meditation, for some examples. Also included are physical therapies like massage, reflexology, acupressure, acupuncture, and the use of herbs in multiple forms. Mental/emotional therapies could also include meditation, but also hypnotherapy, flower remedies, counseling, anger therapy. With these whole being based approaches, another aspect of these therapies that is of critical importance is dietary, including nutritional adjustments, vitamins, minerals, herbal supplements/remedies. - ***Associated with Meditation for Me group.
