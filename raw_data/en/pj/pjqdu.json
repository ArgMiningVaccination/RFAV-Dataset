Many of these therapies are readily available at relatively low cost. Specific information about the use, evidence, cost, and more is listed on each therapy review. Can supplements replace food? Natural supplements, also called nutraceuticals, are not meant to replace whole foods, which should be your primary source of nutrients. Because supplements often contain isolated nutrients, they do not provide all the benefits of the complex combinations of nutrients found naturally in whole foods.

The way your body recognizes, absorbs, and uses nutrients may depend on other nutrients and components of food that work together within your body. With that understanding, you may find that the wise use of some targeted supplements can help your body achieve better balance and wellness. Are they safe? Although these products are often seen as harmless, that may not be the case. Simply because a product is a nutrient or is sourced from nature doesn't mean that it is completely safe to use. Natural products can affect absorption of other herbs and drugs, and some may reduce your liver's ability to clear drugs like anesthetics from your body during surgery. Allergic reactions to natural products are possible, and some natural products may be toxic or cause side effects if taken over extended periods or even for short periods at high doses. Some should not be used during chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or when preparing for surgery. We strongly encourage you to seek guidance from a licensed provider who can help you choose the natural products and supplements that are right for you and that are safe to use with your other therapies. Also, use caution in choosing supplement brands, as the purity and potency of products can vary widely. Learn more References | | "}
